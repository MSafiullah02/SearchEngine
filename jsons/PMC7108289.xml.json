An overview of current information on airport-related emissions is presented and the key characteristics of the pollution and the impacts on the local and global air quality are discussed. This review further summarises the various methodologies used for measurements and attempts to critically interpret the data available in the literature. Finally, this review will highlight priority areas for research.",

            "text": "The next section traces the main stages of the development of civil aviation, by focussing especially on the changes and development strategies of modern airport systems. Recent traffic data and statistics are presented and the trends are also discussed in order to understand the potential future growth of air transport, which is fundamental to forecasting the impacts of aviation in future years. The third section gives an overview of the operation of aircraft engines, briefly discusses the most widely used technologies, describes some fuel characteristics, such as the sulphur content, and analyses the current use and future jet fuel consumption scenarios. The fourth section reviews the current information on aircraft engine exhaust: the landing and take-off cycles are described since they are commonly used to assess aircraft emissions during the operational conditions within an airport and within the atmospheric surface boundary layer; the main gaseous and particulate-phase compounds emitted by aircraft are listed and their key chemical and physical characteristics are described in separate subsections. A summary of data on the emission indices for many pollutants is also provided. The fifth section describes the non-exhaust emissions related to aircraft operations, such as the tyre and brake wear and the re-suspension of runway material, which have been little investigated even though they may have serious impacts on local air quality. The sixth section reviews data on the non-aircraft emissions potentially present within an airport, including the ground service equipment emissions, the auxiliary/ground power units and others. The seventh section presents the results of studies conducted indoors and outdoors at airports to directly assess the impacts of AEs upon human health. Finally, this paper reviews the results of the recent literature on aircraft emissions and other airport-related contributions to highlight the potential role of AEs upon local air quality.",

            "text": "The Airport Council International (ACI, 2013) has reported recent statistics on the air traffic volumes for 2012: more than 79 million aircraft movements carried annually 5.7 billion passengers between 1598 airports located in 159 countries, and reported that the total cargo volume handled by airports was 93 million tonnes. However, these numbers are expected to further increase in the forthcoming decades: in the past half century, the aviation industry has experienced a strong and rapid expansion as the world economy has grown and the technology of air transport has developed (Baughcum et al., 1999). Generally, air traffic has been expressed as revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) by multiplying the number of revenue-paying passengers aboard the vehicle by the travelled distance, or occasionally in revenue tonne kilometres (RTK). Fig. 1\nshows the absolute growth of aviation recorded by ICAO in terms of RPK, RTK and aircraft kilometres from the 1930s to today (ICAO, 2013, Airlines for America, 2013). Despite some global-scale events, such as the Gulf crisis (1991), the terrorist attack of 11th September 2011, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002\u20132003 and the recent global economic crisis (2008\u20132009), an average annual growth rate of 5% was observed and this trend is expected to continue over the next decades mainly driven by the economic growth of emerging regions (ACI, 2007, ACI, 2008, Airbus, 2012, Boeing, 2013). It is anticipated that there will be more than 9 billion passengers globally by 2025 and more than 214 million tonnes of total world freight traffic are forecast over almost 120 million air traffic movements (ACI, 2007). The future growth of air transport will inevitably lead to the growth of airline fleets and route networks and will therefore lead to an associated increase in airport capacity in terms of both passengers and cargo. This poses questions as to the consequent impact on air quality.",

            "text": "Engines for civil and general aviation are generally classified as gas turbine engines (turbofan and turboprop) fuelled with aviation kerosene (also named jet fuel) and internal combustion piston engines fuelled with aviation gasoline, often referred as avgas (ICAO, 2011). The majority of modern airliners are equipped with turbofan engines. These engines are derived from predecessor turbojet engines developed during World War II. A turbojet is composed of an inlet compressor, a combustion section adding and igniting fuel, one or more turbines extracting energy from the exhaust gas in expansion and driving the compressor. A final exhaust nozzle accelerates the exhaust gas from the back of the engine to generate thrust. Turbofan engines use a turbojet as a core to produce energy for thrust and for driving a large fan placed in front of the compressor. In modern airliners, the fan provides most of the thrust. The \u201cbypass ratio\u201d refers to the ratio of mass flux bypassing the combustor and turbine to the mass flux through the core: high-bypass ratios are preferred for civil aviation for good fuel efficiency and low noise. Some small and regional airliners are instead equipped with turboprop engines, which use a turbine engine core fitted with a reduction gear to power propellers. A simplified diagram of a turbofan engine is provided in Fig. 2\n. In August 2013 the ICAO (EASA, 2013) listed a total of 487 in-use turbofan engines (including packages): Table 1\nprovides a summary of the current engine families mounted in the most popular airliners (75% of total in-use turbofan engines).",

            "text": "Reciprocating piston engines are predominately fitted in small-sized aircraft typically related to private use, flying clubs, flight training, crop spraying and tourism. Internal piston engines run under the same basic principles as spark ignition engines for cars, but generally require higher performance. Four-stroke-cycle engines are commonly used, more rarely these can be two-stroke and occasionally diesel. The principal difference between jet and piston engines is that combustion is continuous in jet engines and intermittent in piston engines. Other flying vehicles may be present within an airport, such as helicopters. These vehicles are usually less numerous than the airliners in most terminals, but in some circumstances their contribution to the air quality cannot be disregarded. Today, most modern helicopters are equipped with turboshaft engines, whose functioning is similar to a turbojet but are optimised to generate shaft power instead of jet thrust. This review abbreviates turbojet (TJ), turbofan (TF), turboprop (TP) and turboshaft (TS).",

            "text": "At the current time, almost all aviation fuel (jet fuel) is extracted from the middle distillates of crude oil (kerosene fraction), which distils between the gasoline and the diesel fractions. The kerosene-type fuels most used worldwide in civil aviation are of Jet A and Jet A-1 grades: Jet A is used in most of the world, except North America where Jet A-1 is used. An exhaustive review of jet fuel production processes is given elsewhere (Liu et al., 2013). The specifications of such fuels are addressed by two organizations, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MOD). Jet A is used for almost all commercial aviation flying within or from the USA and is supplied against the ASTM D1655 specification. It has a flash point minimum of 38 \u00b0C and a freeze point maximum of \u221240 \u00b0C. Jet A-1 is widely used outside the USA and follows the UK DEF STAN 91-91 (Jet A-1) and ASTM D1655 (Jet A-1) specifications. It has same flash point as Jet A but a lower freeze point (maximum of \u221247 \u00b0C) and a mean C/H ratio of C12H23 (Lewis et al., 1999, Chevron Corporation, 2006, Lee et al., 2010). Other fuels can be used as an alternative to Jet A-1. Jet B is a wide-cut type fuel covering both the naphtha and kerosene fractions of crude oil and is used in very cold climates, e.g. in northern Canada where its thermodynamic characteristics (mainly lower freeze point and higher volatility) are suitable for handling and cold starting. ASTM publishes a specification for Jet B, but in Canada it is supplied against the Canadian specification CAN/CGSB 3.23. Other specifications also exist such as DCSEA (France) and GHOST (Russia). TS-1 is the main jet fuel grade available in Russian and CIS states, along with T-1, T-2 and RT; it is a kerosene-type fuel with slightly higher volatility (flash point is 28 \u00b0C minimum) and lower freeze point (<\u221250 \u00b0C) compared to Jet A and A-1 fuels. Various types of jet fuels are instead regulated by Chinese specifications: RP-1 and RP-2 are kerosene-type fuels similar to Russian TS-1, while RP-4 to Jet B. Nowadays, virtually all jet fuel in China is RP-3, which is quite comparable to Jet A-1 (Shell, 2013). Fuels for military purposes are formulated for high-performances and are regulated separately by many governments; some of these (JP grades for USA and NATO forces) were used in several studies (e.g., Anderson et al., 2006, Chen. et al., 2006, Cowen et al., 2009, Cheng et al., 2009, Cheng and Corporan, 2010, Santoni et al., 2011). The kerosene-based JP-8 grade is currently the primary fuel for NATO aircraft. Corporan et al. (2011) reported some JP-8 characteristics.",

            "text": "Jet fuels are a mixture of thousands of different hydrocarbons. The range of their molecular weights is restricted by the distillation: in kerosene-type fuels (e.g., Jet A and Jet A-1) the carbon number ranges between about 8 and 16, while in wide-cut jet fuels (Jet B), between about 5 and 15. Spicer et al. (1994) reported that jet fuel is primarily composed of species with five or more carbons and 70% of the compounds by weight contain 11\u201314 carbon atoms. Most of the hydrocarbons in jet fuel are members of the normal paraffins, iso-paraffin, cycloparaffin, aromatic and alkene classes: 20% n-paraffins, 40% iso-paraffin, 20% naphthenes and 20% aromatics are typical (Lindstedt and Maurice, 2000, Liu et al., 2013 and reference therein). Moreover, a series of different additives are required or approved for use by ASTM and DEF STAN specifications to enhance or maintain some fuel properties, improve performance or handling. Among those approved for Jet A and Jet A-1 fuels, some hindered phenols serve as antioxidants, the di-ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acts as icing inhibitor, the N,N\u2032-disalicylidene-1,2-propane diamine is added as chelating agent for many metal ions. Other additives act as electrical conductivity/static dissipaters, corrosion inhibitor and biocides: a summary is listed in Chevron Corporation (2006).",

            "text": "The aviation industry is nowadays investing significant effort towards the use of alternative fuels (Blakey et al., 2011, Williams et al., 2012). Since aircraft emissions are recognised to be closely linked to the fuel composition (Beyersdorf et al., 2013 and reference therein), recently the introduction of synthetic fuels and bio-fuels instead of common oil-derivate jet fuels has been much discussed in terms of beneficial effects upon exhaust emissions (e.g., Corporan et al., 2005, Corporan et al., 2007, DeWitt et al., 2008, Timko et al., 2010a, Corporan et al., 2011, Lobo et al., 2011, Williams et al., 2012, Cain et al., 2013). Among others, the Fischer\u2013Tropsch (FT) fuel seems to be a potential candidate for replacing, or mixing with, oil-derived conventional jet fuels. The FT reaction was developed in the first half of twentieth century and uses a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to produce a complex product stream of paraffins, olefins, and oxygenated compounds such as alcohols and aldehydes via product upgrading (e.g., cracking, fractionation, and isomerisation). The mechanism is explained in Liu et al. (2013). The FT process leads to a fuel with low aromatic content and no sulphur, which are reported to be beneficial in reduction of emissions of particulate matter and its precursors from aircraft engines (Corporan et al., 2007, Timko et al., 2010a, Lobo et al., 2011). Corporan et al. (2011) report gas chromatograms and hydrocarbon content of JP-8 and various alternative jet fuels. To study the effects of FT fuel usage on aircraft gaseous and particulate emissions the Alternative Aviation Fuel Experiment (AAFEX) was carried out in 2009: results are spread across various papers (e.g., Lee et al., 2011, Santoni et al., 2011, Anderson et al., 2011, Kinsey et al., 2012a, Kinsey et al., 2012b, Beyersdorf et al., 2013).",

Nowadays there are two main grades (100 and 100LL low lead) regulated by the ASTM D910 and UK DEF STAN 91-90 specifications. Tetraethyl Pb is added to avgas for increasing fuel octane and avgas 100LL has a lead content up to 0.56 g Pb L\u22121. The impact of general aviation is under discussion, since it was reported as one of the largest remaining source of lead emissions to the air in the USA (e.g., Carr et al., 2011). Avgas is principally composed of isoparaffinic and aromatic hydrocarbons and their carbon numbers vary from about 4 (butane) to 10, with the most prevalent carbon number being 8 (Chevron Corporation, 2006). It may include tetraethyl lead as antiknock additive, icing inhibitors, antioxidants and others.",

A similar reduction has not occurred for jet fuel although at the beginning of the 2000s the IPCC indicated that reducing the sulphur content of kerosene will reduce SOx emissions and sulphate particle formation (IPCC, 1999). The maximum sulphur content of aviation fuel has remained at 3 g S kg Fuel\u22121, or 3000 ppm by mass (Lewis et al., 1999, Ebbinghaus and Wiesen, 2001, Anderson et al., 2005, Barrett et al., 2012). However, lower values of fuel sulphur content (FSC) have commonly been reported: Fahey et al. (1999) stated that in the world market at the beginnings of the 2000s the FSC was near 400 ppm; Hileman et al. (2010) reported that average FSC in commercial Jet A, Jet A-1 and military JP-8 fuel grades varied between 550 and 750 ppm; Agrawal et al. (2008) reported that FSC in the fuel was 300 ppm. Popovicheva et al. (2004) and Demirdjian et al. (2007) reported that the aviation kerosene TS-1 has a FSC of 1100 ppm and less than 10\u22124 wt.% of metals.",

            "text": "The availability of reliable information on fuel consumption is essential to make robust estimates of aviation emissions at both global and regional scales. Various estimates of aviation fuel consumption are available in the literature and generally refer only to jet fuel, since piston-powered flights were estimated to account for approximately 2% of propeller (piston plus turboprops) and \u223c0.05% of total (propeller plus jet) fuel burn (Kim et al., 2007). Gauss et al. (2006) estimated a total of 169 Tg fuel globally burned in 2000, of which 152 Tg is due to civil flights. The AERO2k global aviation emissions inventories reported a total of 176 Tg of kerosene used in 2002 for both civil (156 Tg) and military (19.5 Tg) aviation (Eyers et al., 2004); other studies of the 2000\u20132005 period estimated that the global aviation industry consumed approximately 170\u2013203 Tg of kerosene per year with an evident decrease in 2001\u20132002 following the drop of aviation traffic due to the 11th September 2001 and SARS events (Kim et al., 2007); Wilkerson et al., 2010, Whitt et al., 2011 and Olsen et al. (2013) reported that the global commercial aircraft fleet burned 188 Tg of fuel in 2006; Ch\u00e8ze et al. (2011) reported a world consumption of 229 Mt of jet fuel in 2008. These estimates accounted for approximately 3% of current annual fossil fuel energy usage (Barrett et al., 2010, and reference therein). Data from OPEC (Mazraati, 2010) stated that the aviation sector in 2006 was the second major consumer of total oil demand in the transportation sector (11.2%) and accounted for 5.8% of total oil consumed in the world. Given the past and future growth of the aviation industry, this consumption may rise further: AERO2k emission inventories estimated a forecast scenario for 2025 in which the fuel demand for aviation will be 327 Tg y\u22121 (Eyers et al., 2004); Ch\u00e8ze et al. (2011) reported that the world jet fuel demand is projected to grow by 38% between 2008 and 2025, rising to more than 316 Mt in 2025 at a mean growth rate of 1.9% per year. Owen et al. (2010) estimated the future global aviation emissions under four of the IPCC/SRES (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change/Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) marker scenarios and reported a fuel use of 336 Tg in 2020 and varying from 426 to 766 Tg for 2050. This study also reported an estimate of 325 Tg for 2050 if the ambitious technology targets of the Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe (ACARE, 2002) were to be achieved. Table 2\nsummarises the yearly global fuel consumption reported in recent studies. However, aviation traffic growth and jet fuel demand have been shown not to be strictly correlated, since the efficiencies of aircraft engines and air traffic management are improving and modern airliners are 75% quieter with consequent fuel consumption reduced by 70% with respect to the 1960s (Baughcum et al., 1999, Nygren et al., 2009, and references therein). In particular, the current average fuel consumption of in-use fleets was estimated to be less than 5 L fuel every 100 RPK, while in most modern aircraft it drops to approximately 3.5 L/100 RPK: Nygren et al. (2009) reported the historical world fleet of aircraft average fuel consumption and found an exponential trend in fuel consumption reduction from 1987 to the present day. Oil prices have driven investment in more efficient aircraft models. Fuel costs exceed those of labour costs for airlines. Fuel costs accounted for \u223c13% of total costs in 2002, but today they are closer to 34% (Boeing, 2013).",

Due to the geographical distribution of civil aviation in the 2000s, the global fuel burn by domestic flights is dominated by the North America and Caribbean regions, while fuel consumed by international flights is dominated by Asia, North America and the Caribbean, and Western Europe and North Atlantic (Kim et al., 2007). Using the Aviation Emissions Inventory Code (AEIC, Stettler et al., 2011) Simone et al. (2013) estimated the fuel burn by country of origin/destination in 2005 and reported that the USA was the most important (59.1 Tg), followed by Japan (9.7 Tg), UK (9.4 Tg), China (8.5 Tg, excluding Hong Kong), Germany (6.7 Tg) and France (5.4 Tg). A map showing the column sum of global fuel burn from scheduled civil aviation in 2005 is provided in Fig. 4\na. Other studies have been carried out to estimate annual fuel consumption and pollutant emissions more locally: for example Fan et al. (2012) assessed the fuel consumption and emissions for each airline in China in 2010.",

Although most studies have concluded that 5\u201310% of fuel is burned below 1000 m, aircraft operations within airports may further increase fuel consumption due to the acceleration and deceleration of the engines following airport congestion (Anderson et al., 2005, Nikoleris et al., 2011) or due the unaccounted use of fuel for APUs (Ratliff et al., 2009).",

A LTO cycle refers to all the operations the aircraft carry out below 3000 ft above field elevation (equivalent to 914 m) over a specific range of certifiable operating conditions and includes four stages in terms of both engine thrust settings (expressed as a percentage of maximum rated thrust, or F00) and typical time in each specific mode of operation (time-in-mode, TIM). The 3000 ft height roughly corresponds to the atmospheric mixing height, i.e. the lower part of the troposphere within which pollutants emitted at ground-level mix rapidly (e.g., Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2006). The LTO cycles are designed for aircraft engines manufactured after 1985 whose rated output is greater than 26.7 kN and aim to guarantee they not exceed certain regulatory environmental limits for a series of pollutants, namely unburned total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and smoke number (SN). This latter parameter is roughly representative of the amount of soot an engine generates (e.g., Wayson et al., 2009, Stettler et al., 2013a, Stettler et al., 2013b). In the first LTO phase the aircraft descends from cruising altitude toward the runway and lands at the airport. This phase is named \u201capproach\u201d and is estimated as lasting for 4 min with engines at 30% F00. After landing, the aircraft enters in the \u201cidle\u201d phase which includes all the ground-based operations: it proceeds at a low speed to the gate (taxi-in), remains on stand-by for the loading and unloading operations and again prepares for take-off proceeding towards the runway (taxi-out). Idle lasts 26 min and the engines are required to be at 7% F00. The subsequent operating modes include the \u201ctake-off\u201d with engines stressed to the full thrust (100% F00) for 0.7 min, and the \u201cclimb\u201d (85% F00 for 2.2 min) up to 3000 ft height. A standardised LTO cycle is shown in Fig. 5\n.",

            "text": "In addition to the operations falling within LTO cycles, the ground running procedures (GRPs) may lead to further emission loads from aircraft engines at airports. GRPs refer to the operation of some or all engines carried out on the ground for the purpose of functionally checking the operation of either engines or aircraft systems. GRPs are therefore an essential part of the operation of any airliner prior to the release to service of an aircraft from maintenance. The main reasons for running the engines on the ground are (Buttress and Morris, 2005): (i) check starts after minor maintenance actions; (ii) runs at no more than ground idle to ensure that the engine operates correctly after maintenance action, these include thrust reverser function checks, etc.; (iii) runs at powers greater than ground idle to check the correct operation of certain valves, leak checks, etc. To date, only few studies take into account the emissions from GRPs, but their importance for the atmospheric loads of some pollutants cannot be neglected. For example, Buttress and Morris (2005) showed that GRPs at London Heathrow airport release approximately 15.6 Mg y\u22121 NOx. Mazaheri et al. (2011) investigated the annual emissions of particle number, particle mass and NOx throughout the LTO cycles and GRP at the Brisbane Airport and showed that annual emissions account for less than 3%. Despite the evidence that GRPs may have a substantial impact on local air quality at airports, up to now they have received only minor consideration. GRPs are not yet regulated internationally and must comply only with local regulatory requirements imposing limitations on the locations, times and engine thrust levels employed during ground running which may differ from one airport to another.",

            "text": "The use of standard LTO cycles as a surrogate for typical aircraft operations close to the ground represents an approximation and is not always representative of operations at airports. One limitation is that the ICAO engine emissions standards are applied through national and multi-national certification processes to turbojet and turbofan engines, but not turboprop, turboshaft and piston engines (ICAO, 2011). This limitation may be negligible at large airports, where most traffic is due to common airliners equipped with TF engines, but may represent a major approximation for small and medium-sized airports where small, private, business and regional aircraft account for a large portion of flight traffic. In addition, despite LTO cycles having been designed to model optimally all the operational procedures of aircraft in the vicinity of airports, sometimes they are not well adapted to engine settings and actual TIM, which depend upon pilot' technique, fleets, airport layouts and flight traffic. In fact, default ICAO TIM are not representative of real operations and are for certification purposes. Consequently, although some inventories account for the deviations from the ICAO default TIMs and thrust settings, some deviations from the standardised LTO procedures may occur during actual LTO cycles. This inevitably leads to some differences between actual airport operations and emission inventories used in modelling studies. The main deviations/limitations are:\u2022reduced thrust during take-off. This practice is often carried out for performance and cost-efficiency reasons (ICAO, 2011) and has been widely observed on operational runways (Carslaw et al., 2008, Herndon et al., 2008); it may depend on aircraft weight and weather factors (Morris, 2002) and is often largely unknown (Carslaw et al., 2008). Since the emissions of some pollutants increase monotonically with the thrust (e.g., NOx), this could lead to an overestimation of emissions from airports;\u2022lower thrust at idle/taxi mode. It has been reported that most aircraft use a thrust of 3%\u20134% F00 instead of 7% (Morris, 2005a, Morris, 2005b, Nikoleris et al., 2011 and reference therein) during idle operations. Since most pollutants emitted in exhaust plumes are strongly increased at decreased power settings (CO and generally all hydrocarbons), this may lead to underestimation of emissions at airports. In this context, Wood et al. (2008b) suggested that the thrust used in taxi operations can be split in two modes, i.e. \u2018ground idle\u2019 carried out at 4% F00 and \u2018taxiway acceleration\u2019 with thrust settings up to 17%. Moreover, higher thrust levels are sometimes used for turning;\u2022acceleration and deceleration of the engines or stop-and-go situations. This is mainly the result of congestion on taxiways and is known to be responsible for significant increases in fuel consumption and increased emissions (Anderson et al., 2005, Nikoleris et al., 2011). For example Morris (2005a) reported that instant accelerations up to 10% F00 and lasting \u223c10 s may occur at London Heathrow airport when aircraft cross an active runway or make a sharp turn. Due to this, the entire taxiway phase of operation using a uniform engine thrust level have been also recognised as problematic for emission inventory estimates because of the nonlinear emission rate of many compounds at low power (Herndon et al., 2009);\u2022use of a reverse thrust phase during landing. Reverse thrust is applied to assist mechanical brakes in slowing down the landing aircraft and is not generally required for normal operations onto a dry runway (ICAO, 2011). However, it generally occurs with idle thrust power as a prudent safety precaution, and under some circumstances it may also occur at power higher than 10% F00 (Morris and Easey, 2005, Stettler et al., 2011). Generally, reverse thrust is applied for 10\u201320 s (Fanning et al., 2007, Stettler et al., 2011), but may vary as a function of the landing velocity, runway length and aircraft weight;\u2022the evident differences between the standard TIM, which is used as part of the ICAO engine emissions certification processes, and the actual TIM used at airports (e.g., Unique, 2004, Watterson et al., 2004, Patterson et al., 2009, Stettler et al., 2011, Mazaheri et al., 2011, Khadilkar and Balakrishnan, 2012). For example, Patterson et al. (2009) and Khadilkar and Balakrishnan (2012) observed that total fuel burn during departures and arrivals at airports is generally overestimated by the ICAO method with respect to emissions computed from real-time aircraft flight data. Other studies have also reported measured TIM at airports: Unique (2004) reported TIM in Zurich airport and detected differences in all the LTO phases: idle (\u221243%), approach (+10%), climb (\u221277%) and take-off (+129%) which have been estimated to have a strong impact on the calculation of emissions, resulting in reduced fuel flow (\u221238%) and NOx emissions (\u221231%);\u2022the composition of the fleet that serves an airport and the weight of the aircraft. Since the ICAO certifies the engines and not the full aircraft, some airplane characteristics, mainly the aircraft weight, may have a key role in determining the emissions. Furthermore, in addition to the mass of the aircraft, its load of fuel, passengers and goods affect the overall weight: it is reported that passengers, crew and luggage usually add 6\u201315% to aircraft weight (Hu et al., 2009). Most of those factors vary from flight to flight, are largely unknown and may have direct implications for reduced thrust during take-off. In fact, it should be inferred that the increase of the aircraft weight has direct effects upon the thrust levels needed for carrying out usual LTO operations. For example, Carslaw et al. (2008) studied the NOx emissions at London Heathrow and found evidence for statistically significant differences in the emissions from the same engine type used on the same aircraft frame. Among other factors, they speculated that the aircraft weight could be a cause. In a study conducted in eight major busy airports, Turgut and Rosen (2010) detected significant differences in the emissions of some pollutants and concluded that every airport has LTO cycles carried out by aircraft with different characteristics and, consequently, emissions. Another recent study by Turgut et al. (2013) showed a good relationship between aircraft mass and the NOx emission during take-off and climb, which supports the concept of an explicit relationship between the aircraft weight and emissions. There is a general lack of knowledge about the relationships between aircraft mass and emissions, although some recent studies have indicated that heavier aircraft also emit more particles (Zhu et al., 2011).\n",

For example, in a study of the air quality and public health impacts of UK airports, Stettler et al. (2011) used specific TIMs derived from Watterson et al. (2004) and Underwood et al. (2004) composed of 12 phases, namely approach, landing roll, reverse thrust, taxi-in, taxiway acceleration, APU, taxi-out, taxiway acceleration, hold, take-off, initial climb and climb-out. Proposed TIMs were developed by analysing the common procedures of an A320 aircraft at London Heathrow, but may vary by aircraft size category. Other studies (e.g., Ratliff et al., 2009), used models, such as the Emissions and Dispersion Modelling System (EDMS), which also requires jet fuel quality data, main engine and APU specifications, aircraft weight and ground operating time to generate more reliable emission estimates.",

Fuel-based emission indices for the compound X are calculated according to:EI(X)=Fc\u00b7(MX/MCO2)\u00b7(\u0394X/\u0394CO2)where Fc represents the stoichiometric calculation of CO2 produced per kilogram of fuel consumed (with units g CO2 kg Fuel\u22121) assuming complete combustion and given a particular hydrogen to carbon ratio (e.g., Herndon et al., 2004). Mx and MCO2 are the molecular weights of the compound X and CO2, respectively, and \u0394X and \u0394CO2 are the enhancements of compound X and CO2 within the plume, respectively (e.g., Anderson et al., 2006). Unless specified differently, by convention EI(NOx) is defined in terms of NO2 and therefore the mass of NOx emissions is:NOxasNO2=NO2emissions+NOemissions\u00b7M(NO2)/M(NO)where M(NO2) and M(NO) are the molecular weights of NO2 and NO, respectively. In a similar way it should be specified that EI(hydrocarbons) is often referenced to methane (Wahner et al., 1995). ICAO maintains a databank of engine certification data for commercial aviation reporting EIs for the four selected pollutants (EASA, 2013). Emissions of a pollutant X from an engine can be therefore calculated using three parameters: the first two are provided by the ICAO databank and are the main engine EI(X) and the engine fuel flow, i.e., the burned fuel at a defined power setting (expressed as kg s\u22121); the third parameter is the time-in-mode (TIM), i.e. the time the engines spend at an identified power setting (ICAO, 2011):Emission(X)=EI(X)\u00b7TIM\u00b7fuelflow\n",

Since different engines have different characteristics, including the thrust force, Fig. 6 also shows the ratios between the fuel burned during complete LTO cycles and the engine maximum rated thrust (in kN) to normalise the fuel consumption of the engine power. Fig. 7 summarises the ICAO EI data (all in-use engines certified from 1976 to today) per each LTO stage, expressed as g pollutant emitted per kg fuel burned. Fig. 8 shows the total burned fuel and emissions per each LTO phase, i.e. the product of EIs per standardised time in each phase per fuel flow. The reprocessing of ICAO data does not take into account the number of units produced for each engine model, but only the different models produced and still in service in April 2013 (and included in the ICAO databank), regardless of manufacturer, type and technology. Moreover, data refer to single engines, and generally conventional aircraft are equipped with 1\u20134 engines. Therefore the sole purpose of the reprocessing of ICAO data is to report qualitatively the trends in fuel consumption and emissions for in-use TF engines.",

However, such data are often sparse and results poorly comparable. Most studies were carried out using single or a few engine types, under certain environmental conditions, without a standardised thrust and/or often using different measurement techniques and instrumental set-up. Table 3\nlists the most recent studies available in the literature reporting EIs for various engines in aircraft and helicopters. The table also shows some information (if available) about tested aircraft, engine models, selected thrust, type of fuel, sampling methodologies and analytical techniques. Table 4\nprovides a list of recent studies which measured EIs during real aircraft operations at airports. Most of the data in such studies (both engine tests and real world operations) are summarised in the Supplemental Information Tables SI1, SI2, SI3 and SI4, which provide detailed information about the EIs for many gaseous pollutants, speciated hydrocarbons, particle number, particle mass (including soot) and species/ions in particulate matter, respectively. Note that specific thrust levels provided in the tables are derived from the literature and are categorised in five groups, named idle, approach, cruise, climb and take-off, on the basis of the engine type. The thrust, expressed as F00, is always provided along with the EIs. Additional tested thrust levels (if available) are also reported, along with fuel and analytical methodologies.",

            "text": "As indicated by the large number of studies in Table 3, Table 4, most of the literature provides results through the calculation of EIs. When applied to the specific testing studies on engines or airplanes, such methodology has the advantage of giving data easily comparable with EIs reported in the ICAO databank. This may allow a better evaluation of the differences amongst tested engines and technologies or, in case of the use of innovative analytical devices, allows a check the agreement between data obtained and certified values. In contrast, expressing the results as EIs from studies conducted during real-world operations at airports has both advantages and limitations. An advantage of the specific studies may be comparison of the results with the ICAO data to detect changes due to evolution of the exhaust plume, e.g. aging and gas-to-particle partitioning. Carslaw et al. (2008) noticed that EIs do not give a clear indication of the absolute contribution of aircraft emissions to ground-level concentrations, which is important for assessing air quality at airports. Furthermore, they commented that the value of EIs may be substantially affected by limited knowledge of some important aircraft operational factors, such as the aircraft weight and thrust setting at take-off. A list of remaining studies conducted at airports and in their surroundings, which do not report data expressed as EIs, is provided in Table 5\n. In summary, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 provide an overview of the most important studies reported in this review for the characterisation of aircraft emissions in both tests and real operations.",

Contrails are formed whenever the requisite conditions of either ice or water supersaturation exist within aircraft exhaust plumes (DeWitt and Hwang, 2005). Subsequently, in the early 1970s, concern grew over a possible role in stratospheric ozone depletion while interest in the impact of nitrogen oxide emissions on the formation of tropospheric ozone began in the late 1980s (Lee et al., 2009, and references therein). Subsequent studies (e.g., Wahner et al., 1995, Brasseur et al., 1996, Schumann, 1997) investigated a number of emissions other than CO2, and effects from aviation with potential effects on climate. To date there are a large number of studies characterising aircraft emissions during cruising (e.g., Fahey et al., 1995a, Fahey et al., 1995b, Busen and Schumann, 1995, Schumann et al., 1996, Schlager et al., 1997, Paladino et al., 1998, Anderson et al., 1998a, Curtius et al., 1998, Brock et al., 2000, Schr\u00f6der et al., 2000, Schumann et al., 2000, Schumann et al., 2002, Curtius et al., 2002, Jurkat et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The RF of civil aviation emissions has been extensively studied (e.g., Prather et al., 1999, Wuebbles et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2009) and can be summarised in the following emitted compounds and processes, each having positive (+) or negative (\u2212) forcing: H2O (+); CO2 (+); the atmospheric chemistry of NOx causes the formation of tropospheric O3 (+) but also the destruction of methane (\u2212); oxidation of SO2 results in sulphate particles (\u2212); contrails (+); aviation-induced cloudiness (potentially +); soot, mainly composed of black carbon (+). Lee et al. (2009) estimated that aviation-induced RF in 2005 was \u223c55 mW m\u22122, which accounted for 3.5% of global anthropogenic RF. In addition, black carbon emissions generated by aircraft at altitude have been shown to have a role in the formation of contrails (Schumann, 1996) and contrail-induced cirrus clouds, which affect the Earth's radiation balance by reflecting incoming solar radiation and by absorbing and re-emitting long wave radiation. The result is an additional positive RF of a magnitude similar to that of CO2 (IPCC, 1999, Sausen et al., 2005, Lee et al., 2010). Recently, Azar and Johansson (2012) also assessed the non-CO2 climate impact of aviation, including NOx and contrails, and calculated the emissions weighting factors, i.e. the factor by which aviation CO2 emissions should be multiplied to get the CO2-equivalent emissions for annual fleet average conditions. Recently, Gettelman and Chen (2013) reported the climate impact of aviation aerosol. Although such studies highlighted the climate impact of aviation, it should be borne in mind that the magnitude of the total emissions of pollutants from aviation in terms of mass with direct and/or indirect effects on climate are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than from road transport or shipping (Balkanski et al., 2010, Eyring et al., 2010). The study of aircraft emissions at cruise altitudes is very challenging mainly due to the obvious difficulty of sampling. Thus, measurements are commonly performed indirectly or extrapolated from data collected on the ground or in the laboratory. For this reason, the assessment of cruise emissions at altitude offers unique challenges to understanding the impacts of atmospheric emissions and their processing (Herndon et al., 2008, and reference therein). Computational models are available to extrapolate the test stand EI data to cruise altitude conditions (Baughcum et al., 1996b, Sutkus et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Despite most attention being given to civil aviation, a number of studies have also addressed emissions from military aircraft (e.g., Spicer et al., 1984, Spicer et al., 1992, Spicer et al., 1994, Heland and Sch\u00e4fer, 1997, Heland and Sch\u00e4fer, 1998, Gerstle et al., 1999, Gerstle et al., 2002, Miller et al., 2003, Anderson et al., 2005, Brundish et al., 2007, Corporan et al., 2008, Cheng, 2009, Cowen et al., 2009, Spicer et al., 2009, Cheng et al., 2009, Cheng and Corporan, 2010). Despite the relatively high potential impact of military aircraft emissions under particular circumstances, the task of studying military emissions is very difficult. Unlike civil aviation, military operations generally do not work to set flight profiles and do not follow fixed plans (Wahner et al., 1995). In addition, national and military authorities are reluctant to disclose sensitive information either about operations or in-use technologies. The lack of comprehensive data about military operations makes realistic assessments of the contribution of military aircraft in terms of fuel consumption extremely difficult. In addition, some aircraft may have a dual function, such as the C-130 Hercules, which can be engaged in both military and civilian operations. Henderson et al. (1999) reported a historical breakdown of aviation fuel burn for civil and military aviation: in 1976 fuel burned by civil aviation was 64%, while military was 36%. In 1992 the percentages were 82% and 18%, respectively. Subsequent studies stated that military aviation fleets used 11% (19.5 Tg) of fuel in 2002 and estimated that the military contribution is in the range of 10\u201313% of total aviation emissions (Eyers et al., 2004, Waitz et al., 2005). Table 2 provides estimates of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions from military aviation by the AERO2k model (Eyers et al., 2004). Among the large number of military aircraft, Cheng and Corporan (2010) stated that the three classes of military engines T56, TF33, and T700/T701C fitted in the C130 Hercules, B-52 bomber and Apache/Blackhawk helicopters, respectively, consume 70%\u201380% of the USA military aviation fuel each year.",

Water vapour is a greenhouse gas and its increase in the stratosphere (Solomon et al., 2010) and the free troposphere (Sherwood et al., 2010) tend to warm the Earth's surface (Prather et al., 1999). Water vapour, via latent heat released or absorbed during condensation and evaporation cycles also play an active role in dynamic processes that shape the global circulation of the atmosphere (Schneider et al., 2010). Moreover its effect on the formation of contrails and on the enhanced cirrus generation in the upper troposphere can be relevant for additional global RF with an indirect consequent potential increase of positive effects on global warming (Lee et al., 2009). The annual and global-mean RF due to present-day aviation water vapour emissions has been found to be 0.9 (range 0.3\u20131.4) mW m\u22122 (Wilcox et al., 2012). The increased water vapour in the lower troposphere may have secondary effects on precipitation, fog, visibility and some microphysical processes.",

No differences in emission indices during idle, take-off and cruise power settings are reported (Lewis et al., 1999), as emissions of H2O are a simple function of fuel consumption. The AERO2k inventories (Eyers et al., 2004) estimate a global emission of 217 Tg H2O for 2002, 193 Tg from civil aviation and 24 Tg from military operations. Other more recent estimates report 251 Tg H2O in 2005 (Kim et al., 2007) and 233 Tg H2O in 2006 (Wilkerson et al., 2010). However, the emissions of water by the global aircraft fleet into the troposphere are small if compared with fluxes within the natural hydrological cycle (IPCC, 1999) and thus water vapour from aircraft exhausts is not considered relevant for local air pollution and human health. An estimation of H2O produced by aircraft below 1000 m can be assessed by considering the global use of fuel reported in the literature for LTO cycles: considering the total consumption of 13.9 Tg fuel in 2005 (Kim et al., 2007), a total emission of \u223c17 Tg H2O can be estimated (Table 2). Considering the fuel burn breakdown provided by Simone et al. (2013) for the EU (3.1 Tg in 2005), a total of 3.8 Tg y\u22121 H2O are emitted within European countries.",

More recently, Peters et al.

(1999) report that it accounts for \u223c72% of total combustion products (Fig. 3). Typically, the EI(CO2) from modern aircraft engines is 3160 \u00b1 60 g kg Fuel\u22121 for complete combustion (Lewis et al., 1999, Lee et al., 2010) and emissions of CO2 are a simple function of fuel consumption (e.g., Owen et al., 2010). However, some studies reported that EI(CO2) decreases slightly at low thrust because incomplete combustion may result in a relative increase of CO and hydrocarbons in the exhaust (e.g., Wey et al., 2006, Stettler et al., 2011). The role of aviation in the rise of CO2 emissions on a global scale may not be neglected and a list of estimates of CO2 emissions is provided in Table 2. In 1992, global aviation emissions of CO2 were about 2% of total anthropogenic sources and equivalent to about 13% of emissions from all transportation sources (IPCC, 1999). The AERO2k inventories (Eyers et al., 2004) estimated a global emission of 553 Tg CO2 for 2002, 492 Tg from civil aviation and 61 Tg from military operations, while a higher global emission of 733 Tg y\u22121 was reported for 2005 (Lee et al., 2009), accounting for approximately 3% of the total CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels (Howitt et al., 2011). Other estimates reported are 641 Tg CO2 in 2005 (Kim et al., 2007) and 595 Tg CO2 in 2006 (Wilkerson et al., 2010). As for H2O, an estimate of CO2 produced by aircraft below 1000 m was derived by assuming a constant EI(CO2) of 3160 g kg Fuel\u22121 and by considering the global use of fuel reported in the literature during LTO cycles in 2005 (Table 2). Results show a global emission of 44 Tg CO2 of which about 9.8 Tg y\u22121 are emitted within Europe.",

In the troposphere, CO has a chemical lifetime varying from 30 to 90 days and its major sink is oxidation by hydroxyl radicals (Novelli et al., 1998, Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006). Its ability to form a strong bond with haemoglobin to form carboxyhaemoglobin can cause adverse effects on human health due to the reduction of blood oxygen-carrying capacity. At high exposure levels, CO can lead to asphyxia, whereas at low doses it may cause impaired neuropsychological performance and risk for myocardial ischaemia and rhythm disturbances in persons with cardiovascular diseases (Samoli et al., 2007, Bell et al., 2009).",

Fig. 7 reports the ICAO data (all in-use engines certified from 1976 to today) as a function of LTO stages and shows that CO emission indices are generally greater at lower thrusts. Generally, average EI(CO) for in-use commercial engines included in the ICAO databank vary from 0.6 g kg Fuel\u22121 at take-off power to 31 g kg Fuel\u22121 at idle. Anderson et al. (2006) observed large decreases in CO emissions with increasing engine power for various FSCs (by a factor of \u223c8 from idle to 61% F00) and reported that CO was observed to account for \u223c1% of the total carbon emissions at engine idle, but emissions drop off at cruise thrust (61% F00) contributing <0.1%. Cain et al. (2013) measured emissions from a turbo-shaft engine burning different types of fuel and observed a decrease of CO with increasing engine power mainly due to improved combustion efficiency at higher power settings. Because of their predominant emission at lower power settings, CO emissions from aircraft are of high relevance to air quality in the vicinity of airports because of idle and taxi phases conducted at low thrust and which take up most of the time aircraft spend at an airport. Fig. 8 reports the total CO emissions for in-use engines during the four LTO phases and shows that CO emissions during idle are generally two orders of magnitude higher than climb and take-off phases.",

Anderson et al. (2005) measured nitrous acid (HONO) in the exhaust of a B757 and observed a clear power dependence, increasing with increasing power; at high power, over 2 ppmv of HONO was detected. The same authors (Wormhoudt et al., 2007) further reported an increasing EI(HONO) at increasing thrust, but also reported that the EI(HONO)/EI(NO2) ratio decreases with increasing engine regimes. They found that HONO is a minor constituent (up to 7%) compared with NOx. Herndon et al. (2006) measured NOy at Logan airport in Boston (USA) and reported that the emission index for a B737 increased from idle (2 \u00b1 1.9 g (NOy) kg Fuel\u22121) to take-off (19.5 \u00b1 3.9 g (NOy) kg Fuel\u22121). Wood et al. (2008b) reported that HONO accounts for 0.5%\u20137% of NOy emissions from aircraft exhaust depending on thrust and engine type: 2\u20137% for low thrust and 0.5\u20131% for high thrust (65\u2013100% F00). In conclusion, using data available in the literature, Lee et al. (2010) proposed that EI(HONO) should range between 0.08 and 0.8 g kg Fuel\u22121. More recently, Lee et al. (2011) performed measurements of HONO from a DC-8 aircraft equipped with CFM56-series engines using both traditional and synthetic fuels and observed that the EI(HONO) increases approximately 6-fold from idle to take-off conditions, but plateaus between 65 and 100% of maximum rated engine thrust. This study also discussed the kinetics behind the HONO formation/destruction.",

Generation of HNO3 is generally lower than HONO: Lukachko et al. (1998) reported that only \u223c0.07% of the total NOy is oxidised to HNO3 by the engine exit, while Lee et al. (2010, and references therein) reported EI(HNO3) of 0.003\u20130.3 g kg Fuel\u22121. Because of the very low levels expected in aircraft exhaust, few studies have been carried out on the ground. There is consequently a lack of data about nitric acid measured in engine exhaust plumes during real working conditions.",

Exposure is associated with increased mortality and morbidity (Katsouyanni et al., 1997, Sunyer et al., 2003a) including cardiovascular admissions, particularly for ischaemic heart disease (Sunyer et al., 2003b). Oxidation of SO2 (S(IV)) is recognised as the major channel for the formation of atmospheric sulphuric acid (S(VI)), and sulphur trioxide (SO3) is an important intermediate in the oxidation processes (Vahedpour et al., 2011). Consequently, SO2 has an indirect effect on acid deposition and a key role in the aerosol system by acting as sulphate precursor. Since sulphate aerosol is known to modify the direct and indirect RF, SO2 also has an indirect influence on climate.",

Therefore, SO2 emissions may vary greatly as a function of FSC. In the past, studies were carried out to analyse and model the sulphur emissions of aircraft and to estimate their role in the formation of visible contrails (e.g., Busen and Schumann, 1995, Schumann et al., 1996, Brown et al., 1996b, Brown et al., 1997, Arnold et al., 1998a). Generally an emission index of 0.8\u20131.3 g of SOx (as SO2) per kg Fuel was reported for complete combustion (e.g., Lewis et al., 1999, Kim et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2010, Presto et al., 2011), however measurements at flight altitudes have showed that sulphur dioxide varies with the average FSC (e.g., Arnold et al., 1998a, Schumann et al., 1998). For example, Hunton et al. (2000) reported that the EI(SO2) varied from 2.49 g SO2 kg Fuel\u22121 for a high-sulphur fuel (\u223c1150 ppmm S) in a test chamber to less than 0.01 g SO2 kg Fuel\u22121 for a low-sulphur fuel (\u223c10 ppmm S).

However, on a global scale the aviation source is considered to be secondary with respect to other major sources of SO2: Kjellstr\u00f6m et al. (1999) used an atmospheric general circulation model including the atmospheric sulphur cycle to investigate the impact of aircraft sulphur emissions on the global sulphur budget of the atmosphere and concluded that aviation accounted for about 1% of the total sulphate mass north of 40\u00b0N, where aircraft emissions are largest. In 2004, about 0.18 Tg of SO2 was estimated to be emitted from aviation (Lee et al., 2010) using an EI(SO2) of 0.8 g Fuel\u22121. An estimation of SO2 produced by aircraft below 1000 m can be computed by applying a constant EI(SO2) of 0.8 g kg Fuel\u22121 and by considering the global use of fuel reported by the literature during LTO cycles in 2005 (Table 2). Results show a global emission of 11 Mg SO2 of which about 2.5 Mg y\u22121 are emitted within Europe.",

Past numerical simulations of H2SO4 formation from atomic oxygen and hydroxyl radical in aircraft engines indicated that between 2% and 10% of the fuel sulphur is emitted as S(VI) (Brown et al., 1996a, Lukachko et al., 1998). However, current understanding indicates a more realistic value of 2% (or possibly less). These studies also indicate that S(VI) conversion in the turbine is kinetically limited by the level of atomic oxygen, resulting in a higher oxidation efficiency at lower FSCs. Katragkou et al. (2004) report that the limiting factor of this series of reactions is the oxidation of SO2 by the hydroxyl radical, which is somewhat uncertain at the high temperatures in gas turbine engines. The knowledge of the mechanisms involving sulphur species and their interactions with H, O atoms and radicals occurring within a combustor is far from complete and are the subject of discussion (e.g., Blitz et al., 2003, Somnitz et al., 2005, DeWitt and Hwang, 2005, Yilmaz et al., 2006, Hindiyarti et al., 2007, Rasmussen et al., 2007, Wheeler and Schaefer, 2009, Hwang et al., 2010).",

An understanding of the processes controlling sulphate aerosols is therefore essential to the study of the mechanisms of formation of particles generated by aircraft (e.g., Starik et al., 2004). For example, Arnold et al. (1998a) reported no detectable levels of sulphuric acid in the gas phase behind an in-flight commercial aircraft, leading to the inference that initially formed H2SO4 experiences a rapid gas-to-particle conversion at plume ages <1.6 s. Sulphuric acid was measured in several other studies at cruising altitudes and for different FSCs (e.g., Fahey et al., 1995b, Busen and Schumann, 1995, Schumann et al., 1996, Curtius et al., 1998, Arnold et al., 1998a, Schr\u00f6der et al., 2000, Schumann et al., 2000, Curtius et al., 2002) as well as in fuel combustion experiments at ground-level (Frenzel and Arnold, 1994, Curtius et al., 1998, Curtius et al., 2002, Kiendler and Arnold, 2002, Sorokin et al., 2004) and during combustor testing (Katragkou et al., 2004). Curtius et al. (2002) reported H2SO4 concentrations measured in the plume were up to 600 pptv for a 56 ppmm FSC, while the average concentration of H2SO4 measured in the ambient atmosphere outside the aircraft plume was 88 pptv and the maximum ambient atmospheric concentration 300 pptv.",

            "text": "The abundance ratio, sometime named conversion factor (\u03b5 = (SO3+H2SO4)/total sulphur) has been widely used to assess the ratio of S(VI) to total sulphur at the exit of engines. The literature offers numerous estimates or measures of \u03b5. However, the results are often difficult to compare as they are derived by different methods, ranging from direct measurements, indirect computations and models. In addition, most studies take in account only particulate sulphate, while only a few studies have measured both particulate and gaseous phases. Anyway, Timko et al. (2010b) demonstrated that the conversion of S(IV) to S(VI) is independent of engine technology for most modern in-use engines. Earlier values of \u03b5 are well summarised in DeWitt and Hwang (2005), while most recent measurements and modelling studies of aircraft plume chemistry reported other direct, indirect and inferred values of \u03b5. Generally, \u03b5 values between 1 and 3% are commonly reported. For example, \u03b5 values between 6 and 31% have been calculated for a B757 aircraft (Miake-Lye et al., 1998), while Schumann et al. (2002) observed \u03b5 between 0.34 and 4.5% for an old engine (Mk501) and 3.3 \u00b1 1.8% for a modern engine (CFM56-3B1). For low FSC, they also reported that \u03b5 was considerably smaller than implied by the volume of volatile particles in the exhaust, while for FSC\u2265100 ppm, sulphuric acid is the most important precursor of volatile aerosols formed in aircraft exhaust plumes of modern engines. Kiendler and Arnold (2002) inferred an \u03b5 value of 2  \u00b1  0.8% for a M45H engine on the ground, while Curtius et al., 1998, Curtius et al., 2002 reported 3.3  \u00b1  1.8% in the plume of a B737-300 aircraft in flight by measuring the total H2SO4 content in both gaseous and aerosol phases. The sulphur conversion fraction of an RB211 engine was computed by Starik et al. (2002) using a model and results showed that increases in FSC cause a minor reduction in \u03b5, reporting values \u22489%, and \u22488.4% for FSC of 0.04% and 0.3%, respectively. Wilson et al. (2004) and Sorokin et al. (2004) observed \u03b5 of 2.3  \u00b1  1.2% in an A310 equipped with a CF6-series engine at an exhaust age of about 5 ms from the combustor exit, while Jurkat et al. (2011) derived \u03b5 for various in-flight aircraft and reported an average value of 2.2 \u00b1 0.5%, varying from a minimum of 1.2% for a Trent-series and a maximum of 2.8% for a CMF56-series engines. Wong et al. (2008) modelled the microphysical processes involved and suggested conversion efficiency of 1\u20132%. Timko et al. (2010b) reported \u03b5 ranging from 0.08% to 0.01%, while Kinsey et al. (2011) suggest a median value of 2.4%. Petzold et al. (2005b) reported that sulphur partitioning at 150 \u00b0C was 97% SO2 \u2264 2.7% gaseous H2SO4 < 0.3% chemisorbed H2SO4 at soot particle surface. Regarding the relative abundance of the two S(VI) species, during the COMS experiments Sorokin et al. (2004) reported that SO3 represented the major fraction of S(VI) in the exhaust behind the combustor and that SO3 conversion to H2SO4 takes place in the sampling line where the exhaust gases spend a sufficiently long time and where the temperature is markedly lower than in the hot exhaust. Other experimental measurements made during the EXCAVATE experiment by Anderson et al. (2005) led to the conclusion that the fraction of total sulphur that existed as SO3 would have to be less than 0.005%.",

Note that, amongst the ozone precursors, both CO and many VOCs are mainly emitted at low power settings during airport taxi and idle operations, while NOx is mainly released during take-off and climb phases, when engines reach higher thrusts. It is reported that NO emissions, which are dominant at highest thrusts, initially cause local ozone reductions in aircraft plumes (Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000a, Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000b) following:O3+NO\u2192NO2+O2but subsequently the photolysis of NO2 may form atomic oxygen which reacts with molecular O2 to form O3:NO2+h\u03bd\u2192NO+OO+O2+M\u2192O3+Mwhere M is N2, O2 or another molecule absorbing the excess energy to stabilise the ozone formed (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006). A contrary effect, i.e. a decrease in O3 concentrations, may also occur due to the reaction of ozone with other compounds emitted from aircraft. For example, it is recognised that alkenes, which are emitted in the exhaust plumes, are susceptible to reaction with ozone forming primary carbonyls and bi-radicals (e.g., Grosjean et al., 1994, Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006) and consuming O3.",

Moreover, its roles in atmospheric chemistry to produce tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapour indirectly enhance its climate forcing effects. Although natural emissions from wetlands are largely recognised as dominant sources of methane at global scales, anthropogenic sources, such as energy, agriculture, waste and biomass burning can further contribute to its load in the atmosphere (Dlugokencky et al., 2011 and references therein). Most studies report that turbine engines are not a significant source of CH4 and have concluded that most engines tend to produce minor amounts of methane at idle and may consume it at higher engine power (Spicer et al., 1992, Spicer et al., 1994, Vay et al., 1998, Slemr et al., 2001, Anderson et al., 2006, Santoni et al., 2011). Wiesen et al. (1994) examined methane emissions from different commercial jet engines (PW 305 and RB211) under various flight conditions using different fuels and concluded that air traffic does not contribute significantly to the global budget of methane. Santoni et al. (2011) measured methane emissions from a CFM56-2C1 engine aboard a NASA DC-8 aircraft and reported that the EI for CH4 was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 170 \u00b1 160 mg kg Fuel\u22121 at 4% and 7% F00, while negative values (54 \u00b1 33 mg kg Fuel\u22121) were reported for higher thrust settings, indicating consumption of methane by the engine.",

(2006) reported that the alkene species constituted over 90% of the observed total NMHC at idle but less than 20% at higher engine power settings. They also observed large decreases in alkane and alkene emissions with increasing engine power for various FSCs. In particular, EXCAVATE results showed that propylene underwent the most dramatic decrease, exhibiting a drop of mixing ratios by a factor \u223c280 from 7 to 61% F00. In the same manner, isoprene dropped from \u223c2.5 ppbv to less than \u223c5 pptv (i.e., below the detection limit). On the other hand, these results reported decreases in alkane compounds which were much more modest, typically under a factor of 10. Sch\u00fcrmann et al. (2007) revealed that though isoprene was not directly found in emissions from kerosene refuelling, it was detected in considerable amounts in the aircraft exhaust which indicates that isoprene is most likely formed in the combustion process of a jet engine.",

However, nowadays there is a gap in the current state of knowledge regarding the toxicity of many other aldehydes (including glyoxal, methylglyoxal and crotonaldehyde) which are detected in sizeable quantities in aircraft exhaust plumes and have potential toxic effects (Wood et al., 2008). APEX results (Kinsey, 2009) clearly showed that carbonyls generally account for most of the gaseous hydrocarbons emitted by common aircraft engines. Agrawal et al. (2008) reported that the major three contributors to carbonyl emissions are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone, and showed that carbonyl emissions are significantly higher during the idle mode than at higher thrusts. However, measurements of carbonyl EIs were also found to be very variable since they are sensitive to changes in ambient temperature (Yelvington et al., 2007, Knighton et al., 2007, Agrawal et al., 2008). Similar results were obtained for TS engines: Cain et al. (2013) observed that the EIs for the most prevalent aldehydes emitted at various engine power combinations were formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde and also reported a decrease with increasing engine power. The results of such engine tests seem to be confirmed by ambient measurements. For example, Fanning et al. (2007) and Zhu et al. (2011) reported that the time averaged concentrations of formaldehyde and acrolein were elevated at the Los Angeles International airport relative to a background reference site.",

            "text": "Aromatic compounds are present in jet fuels, and can therefore be emitted as both unburned material and byproducts of incomplete hydrocarbon combustion, but also from fuel evaporation and refuelling (Anderson et al., 2005, Anderson et al., 2006). In this context, the benzene to toluene ratio (B/T) was often proposed to identify the fuel vs combustion origin of hydrocarbon mixtures. For example, Sch\u00fcrmann et al. (2007) observed that the B/T ratio at an airport is well below 1 for refuelling emissions and engine ignition while in the exhaust this value reaches up to 1.7. The US EPA (2009) mass fraction profiles (Fig. 9) clearly show that BTEX account for \u223c4% of identified compounds, while other relevant aromatics (in order of decreasing mass fraction) are phenol, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, styrene, m-ethyltoluene and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene. Generally, the literature shows large decreases in benzene and toluene emissions with increasing engine power, both for TF (Anderson et al., 2006) and TS engines (Cain et al., 2013). In particular, by studying the hydrocarbon emissions from a TS engine operating with conventional (JP-8), alternative and surrogate fuels, Cain et al. (2013) hypothesised that fuel composition and structure may play a significant role in the aromatic emissions of aircraft. They speculated that the propensity of the molecular structure of paraffins in fuels to produce benzene or toluene was observed to follow cycloparaffin > iso-paraffin > n-paraffin. This study also attempted to depict the chemical processes at the basis of their observations and hypothesised that iso- and n-paraffins must first undergo either ring closure or decomposition to combustion/pyrolytic intermediates prone to ring formation (e.g., propargyl radicals and propylene) to ultimately form cyclic and aromatic compounds. In addition, Cain et al. (2013) reported that an increased branching ratio of iso-paraffins resulted in higher production rates of the C3-intermediates, which further contribute to ring/aromatic formation and growth.",

(2008) showed that lighter congeners such naphthalene and its 1-methyl and 2-methyl derivatives contribute strongly to the total PAH mass in various aircraft (TF) emissions at differing thrust modes. Moreover, they also reported that the EI(naphthalene) increased as power increased from idle mode falling off as the engine operated at the highest power. Chen et al. (2006) characterised the PAH emissions of the TS engine of a helicopter at five power settings and reported a mean total PAH concentration in the exhaust of 843 \u03bcg m\u22123, with a maximum of 1653 \u03bcg m\u22123 emitted during ground idle. The emission level of total PAHs during a complete LTO cycle was estimated to be 1.15 g PAHs LTO\u22121. Even if the results provide evidence for high mass concentrations of total emitted PAH, the speciation revealed that lighter congeners, which have generally lower carcinogenic potencies, were dominant: 59.7% of total PAHs emissions were made up of naphthalene, 37.8% of three-ring congeners, while the remaining 2.5% of PAHs had four- to seven-rings. The emission factor revealed U-shaped behaviour: maximum at idle (50%), minimum at fly idle (67%) and increasing until max thrust (100% F00).",

Cavallo et al. (2006) measured the concentrations of 23 PAH in three areas (airport apron, building and terminal/office) of a major Italian airport (Fiumicino, Rome). The airport apron was found to be suffering the highest levels of total PAHs (27.7 \u03bcg m\u22123) with a prevalence of 2\u20133 ring PAH such as methylnaphthalenes and acenaphthene presumably associated with jet fuel combustion. However, they also showed that PAH levels were lower than the threshold limit value proposed for occupational exposure by ACGIH (0.2 mg m\u22123). Similar results were obtained by Zhu et al. (2011), who observed that the semi-volatile PAHs (from phenanthrene to chrysene) were consistently higher at both blast fence and downwind sites from the take-off runway of Los Angeles airport than at a background site. This study also indicated naphthalene as the most abundant gas-phase PAH (80\u201385% of the total PAHs).",

Results showed no consistent trends for OCS and CS2 with varying thrust settings and suggested that the sources of those gases are insensitive to the FSC. In contrast, this study revealed that levels of DMS are dramatically reduced from approximately ambient levels at idle to near the instrument detection limit as engine power is increased and speculated that ambient DMS is essentially burned (oxidised) out of the exhaust stream at combustor temperatures associated with high engine power.",

            "text": "PM generated from aircraft engines can be classified into two major fractions: non-volatile and volatile PM (e.g., Kinsey, 2009, Presto et al., 2011), while the combination of both volatile and non-volatile PM is commonly referred as total PM. Non-volatile PM is directly emitted by engines and is mainly composed of graphitic/elemental/black carbon with traces of metals, which are stable at the high temperatures and pressures normally reached in the exhaust plumes. Volatile PM is instead formed through the gas-to-particle partitioning and conversion processes of sulphur and various organic gases (Robinson et al., 2010, Timko et al., 2010b), which occur after the emission in the near-field plume downstream of the engine (Kinsey et al., 2011). Since the most volatile PM components are partitioned into the gas- and particulate-phases, their behaviour is sensitive on the changes in the environmental conditions with respect to the near-plume and in any case many compounds can remain in equilibrium between the two phases. This component is therefore very sensitive to the sampling conditions (Wey et al., 2006, Wong et al., 2011, Presto et al., 2011). In particular, the organic component of the volatile PM undergoing partitioning between the two phases is named organic aerosol (OA) and can be composed of a large number of different hydrocarbon classes. Moreover, as the reactive compounds can be affected by oxidation by a number of atmospheric oxidant species (mainly hydroxyl, nitrate radicals and ozone), it can be expected that the composition and the quantity of volatile PM changes progressively away from the plume, after natural cooling, dilution and chemical processes occur in the atmosphere. Many hydrocarbons of high volatility, such as BTEX, low molecular weight PAHs, alkanes and many others, may be easily oxidised to species with substantially lower volatilities (Kroll and Seinfeld, 2008) and, thus, may act as precursors for the formation of the secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The formation and the properties of the SOA, including their gas/particle partitioning, are an intense area of research (e.g., Pandism et al., 1992, Pankow, 1994, Odum et al., 1996, Kroll and Seinfeld, 2008, Hallquist et al., 2009) and the common way to describe the partitioning of a constituent i between the gas- and the condensed-phases with mass concentration COA can be described by a partitioning coefficient, \u03be\ni:\u03bei=1/[1+(Ci*/COA)]where Ci* is the effective saturation concentration of the compound, i.e. a semi-empirical property describing the partitioning of complex mixtures. Donahue et al. (2009) proposed three different classes of compounds on the basis of their C\n\u2217 values: (i) the low volatility organic compounds, showing C\n\u2217 from 10\u22122 to 10\u22121 \u03bcg m\u22123 and mostly remaining in the condensed phase under common atmospheric conditions; (ii) the SVOCs, exhibiting C\n\u2217 between 100 and 102 \u03bcg m\u22123 and undergoing significant partitioning and (iii) the intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), having C\n\u2217 in the order of magnitude of 103\u2013106 \u03bcg m\u22123, which are almost entirely in the gas-phase. Recently, some studies have pointed out that most hydrocarbons emitted by aircraft engines are thought to be important SOA precursors (Miracolo et al., 2011, Presto et al., 2011), being in the IVOC and SVOC classes. However, the potential of hydrocarbons emitted by aircraft exhaust to form secondary components is currently poorly understood.",

U-shaped curves of PM emissions versus thrust are commonly reported in the literature, showing elevated emissions at low power settings, a decrease to a minimum at midrange power, and then an increase at high or full power (Whitefield et al., 2008, Kinsey, 2009, Kinsey et al., 2010, Kinsey et al., 2011). Agrawal et al. (2008) noted a 10\u201340-fold increase in the EI(PM) as the engine power increased from idle to climb thrust. However, there are deviations from this behaviour: the PM mass emission indices at varying thrusts have been shown to depend on various factors, including engine families, technology, FSC, operating power, cold and warm engine conditions and environmental conditions (e.g., Kinsey, 2009) and real-time emission rates for PM for a typical TF engine have revealed significant PM spikes during changes in power settings (Agrawal et al., 2008).",

In addition, the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, sunlight, wind, etc.) can also affect PM mass, particularly through the potential for particle formation, coagulation, and growth (e.g., Herndon et al., 2005). Timko et al.

Similarly to EI(PM) the particle number indices were however observed to be sensitive to engine technology, FSC, operating power and environmental conditions: Kinsey (2009) also reported a completely different behaviour for a TJ engine (CJ610-8ATJ), with EI(#) lower at idle and relatively constant at higher F00.",

An inverse pattern with decreasing emissions at increased power settings was instead reported for a common TP engine equipping the widespread used military cargo C-130 Hercules: averaged EI were 1.8\u00b71016, 1.4\u00b71016, 1.4\u00b71016, 1.0\u00b71016, and 1.2\u00b71016 particles kg-Fuel\u22121 for 4%, 7%, 20%, 41% and max thrusts, respectively.

In addition, the dimensions of particles are directly related to their emission sources, as mechanically generated particles (e.g., wind-blown dust, sea spray) are generally largest than 1 \u03bcm, while combustion-generated (high-temperature processes, traffic, many industrial activities) are typically smaller than 1 \u03bcm (e.g., Lewis and Schwartz, 2004, Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006, Ning and Sioutas, 2010). Ultrafine particles (UFPs, diameter <100 nm) typically constitute \u223c90% or more of particle number count in areas influenced by vehicle emissions (Morawska et al., 2008). UFPs have larger surface area per unit mass with respect to larger particles and can potentially contain high proportions of organic material such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, UFPs can penetrate deeper into the respiratory tract and into cells possibly posing an elevated risk for human health (Oberdorster et al., 2004, Delfino et al., 2005, Br\u00e4uner et al., 2007, Belleudi et al., 2010, Knibbs et al., 2011).",

            "text": "A study by Shumway (2002) used scanning electron microscopy to analyse individual particles emitted from military engines and reported predominant particles with dimensions ranging from 22 to 120 nm. It was observed that emitted particles were discrete at low thrust (approach and idle), while they tended to agglomerate at higher power (intermediate and military modes). Similar results have recently been reported by Mazaheri et al. (2013), who analysed the aircraft emissions during normal takeoff and landing operations at an international airport by using the transmission electron microscopy technique. They reported particles in the range of 5\u2013100 nm in diameter with a dominant nucleation mode (18\u221220 nm) and semisolid spherical shapes. Nowadays most studies measure particle size distributions using automatic instruments, such as scanning mobility particle sizers (SMPS), electrical low pressure impactors (ELPI), and differential mobility spectrometers (DMS). A comprehensive review of these devices is provided elsewhere (Kumar et al., 2010). Anderson et al. (2005) reported that exhaust exit-plane measurements on engines mounted in test cells and B757 aircraft in run-up facilities produce of the order of 1015 soot particles per kg of fuel burned with a mean mass diameter of 40\u201360 nm. Using an improved version of the nanometre aerosol size analyser (nASA), they also reported that the aerosol size distribution at 1 m from a B757 engine is a combination of volatile and non-volatile particles with a bimodal distribution. The first (non-volatile) mode was measured by heating the aerosol to 300 \u00b0C before analysis with the nASA and was found to be around 20 nm; this mode was thought to be primarily composed of soot and other components including zinc, aluminium, and titanium which are from the abrasion of engine components or the trace metal impurities in the fuel. The second (volatile) mode was observed at 7 nm and comprised particles that vaporise below 300 \u00b0C.",

A slightly dependence of GMD on thrust was detected, with GMD of 10\u201320 nm at low fuel flow rates, a decrease at mid-power and then an increase at higher thrust. These studies also reported the presence of a prominent nucleation mode mainly on samples collected farther from the engine exit (30 m) with respect to gases sampled at 1 or 10 m. This second mode was attributed to the secondary aerosol generation caused by the expansion and cooling of the exhaust plume and is composed of sulphuric acid and low-volatility hydrocarbons (Wey et al., 2007). APEX results detected changes in both the GMD and related geometric standard deviation (GSD) of the particle size distributions at varying engine and fuel type, thrust, and environmental conditions.",

(2008) observed that the particle number size distributions downstream of a C-130 Hercules showed peaks between 50 and 80 nm for engine power settings ranging from idle to maximum thrust. They also observed a clear trend of increasing particle diameter with increasing engine power setting and distance from the engine exit. Cheng et al. (2008) detected the presence of another peak corresponding to the lower instrumental limit, presumed to be an additional mode below 20 nm. Cheng and Corporan (2010) reported unimodal size distributions for military turbofan, turboprop and turboshaft emissions sampled at the engine exhaust plane. They observed that both the total particle number concentration and GMD increased as the engine power increased for all tested engines. In particular, the observed GMD ranged from 55 nm (at idle) to 85 nm (at 95% F00) in turbofan, from 51 nm (at idle) to 67 nm (at max thrust) in turboprop and from 20 nm (at idle) to 42 nm (at max thrust) in a turboshaft engine.",

At a site located at the blast fence of Los Angeles International Airport, Zhu et al. (2011) reported that total UFPs counts exceeded 107 particles cm\u22123 during take-offs. This study further investigated temporal profiles in particle concentration of 30 nm mobility diameter (corresponding to the mean geometric mode of emitted particles) due to isolated aircraft take-off events: dramatic increases of particle concentrations (from 1.6\u00b7103 to 1.7\u00b7104 particles cm\u22123) were reported when aircraft engines are accelerated to the 100% thrust power for take-off, followed by decreases of number concentrations showing an exponential decay. Similar findings have been reported by Hsu et al. (2012), who observed that departures of jet engine aircraft on a runway may contribute to 1\u00b7103 to 7\u00b7104 particles cm\u22123.

            "text": "Changes in the particle size distributions can also occur after plumes are diluted in ambient air due to coagulation. However, most studies have shown that particle size distributions at airports are comparable with those measured during engine tests. Air monitoring carried out in the surroundings of the Los Angeles International Airport found that the upwind site was dominated by particles of approximately 90 nm diameter whereas downwind sites were dominated by finer particles, peaking at approximately 10\u201315 nm (Westerdahl et al., 2008), which corresponds to the size reported during APEX campaigns for many in-use engines (Kinsey et al., 2010). Similarly, Fanning et al. (2007) and Zhu et al. (2011) reported very high number concentrations of UFPs collected at the blast fence site, with the highest numbers found at a particle size of approximately 14 nm. The same study further observed that the UFP number concentrations measured in a residential community approximately 2\u20133 km downwind of the airport were intermediate in concentration between the airport runway and the background reference site. This finding was associated with aircraft take-off activities and the authors noted the significant exposure and possible health implications for people living near the airport. Mazaheri et al. (2009) revealed that size distributions exhibit similar modality during all phases of the LTO cycles with particles predominantly in the range of 4\u2013100 nm in diameter. This latter study also reported two distinct modes: a nucleation mode at diameters <30 nm observed in all LTO modes and an accumulation mode between 40 and 100 nm more pronounced during take-offs. While the nucleation mode exhibited the highest number concentration of all modes, the accumulation mode dominated the particle mass size distributions. Lobo et al. (2012) measured the specific PM emissions during normal LTO operations at a distance of 100\u2013300 m downwind of an active taxi-/runway at the Oakland International Airport and associated the data with various aircraft/engine combinations. The size distributions were typically bimodal with a nucleation mode composed of freshly nucleated PM and an accumulation mode mostly made up of soot with some condensed volatile material. These observations closely parallel the mechanisms and size distribution of particles in diesel exhaust (Harrison et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Carbonaceous PM consists of a complex mixture of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) (jointly referred to as soot) and commonly accounts for a large fraction of ambient fine particle mass in both rural and urban environments. Soot is primarily generated by incomplete combustion processes through the pyrolysis of organic fuels used in combustion processes. Many studies have discussed the various types of such particles; however there are still controversies and open discussion about the terminology to adopt. The terms used to identify the various fractions of carbonaceous aerosols, such as soot, black carbon (BC), elemental carbon (EC), equivalent black carbon and refractory black carbon are mainly associated with the corresponding measurement methods (e.g., P\u00f6schl, 2003, Andreae and Gelencs\u00e9r, 2006, Bond and Bergstrom, 2006, Kondo et al., 2011, Buseck et al., 2012, Long et al., 2013, Novakov and Rosen, 2013) and more generally refer to the most refractory and light-absorbing component of carbonaceous combustion particles, even if the underlying definitions and measurement methods are different (Petzold et al., 2013). Without going into the merits of this discussion, this section provides an overview of the data concerning the carbonaceous fraction and the terms used (soot, BC and EC) are the same as reported by the original authors. In any case, Lee et al. (2010) indicated that BC is often used interchangeably with soot in the literature relating to aircraft emissions, although in the strictest sense they are different.",

However, soot is still the primary form of non-volatile PM emitted by jet engines (e.g., Timko et al., 2010b), even if its contribution represents only few percent of the global atmospheric BC emission (Hendricks et al., 2004).",

However, once emitted soot particles quickly build complex agglomerates causing a second mode of larger particles between 100 and 500 nm, which are totally amorphous (Petzold et al., 1998, Popovitcheva et al., 2000, Popovicheva et al., 2004, Demirdjian et al., 2007). Despite the structural characteristics of soot being of primary importance in relation to its atmospheric properties, there is a lack of experimental data on microstructure, composition and hygroscopicity of original soot emitted from aircraft engines. Some studies conducted at cruise height (K\u00e4rcher et al., 1996, Gleitsmann and Zellner, 1998) have assumed that all the soot particles in exhausts are hydrophobic. Demirdjian et al. (2007) used a combination of several analytical methods to study the microstructure and the composition of soot agglomerates sampled in an aircraft engine combustor and reported that soot was in two main fractions having quite different physicochemical properties. A major fraction of particles was found to be made up of amorphous carbon with small amounts of oxygen, sulphur and iron and was rather hydrophobic, while a second fraction was characterised by various structures and a large amount of impurities and was highly hydrophilic. Vander Wal et al. (2010) compared the physical structure and the chemical composition of soot produced by different sources, including a modern TF engine, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that some physical characteristics of jet engine soot, such as the lamella length distributions, are intermediate between soot produced by other sources such as wildfires and diesel, while other characteristics are singular. Jet soot was reported to have the highest sp3 carbon content, in fact higher than the sp2 (graphitic) content, the greatest oxygen content in the form of phenolic and carbonyl groups and the widest range of hetero-elements, including S, Na, N, Zn, Ba.",

For example, the hygroscopic properties of jet engine combustion particles have been investigated in several rig-tests and results have confirmed that the water uptake by combustion particles is generally independent of combustor operating conditions, but increases significantly with increasing FSC level, which is attributed to an increasing amount of sulphuric acid adsorbed on the particles (Gysel et al., 2003). The uptake of sulphuric acid and organics seems to be enhanced by the surface irregularities in the soot. The typical fractal agglomerate structure of soot may offer a large specific surface area for adsorption and chemical reactions (Popovitcheva et al., 2000). Recently, Loukhovitskaya et al. (2013) also investigated the uptake of HNO3 on aviation soot.",

Most studies indicated that BC emissions are a function of engine thrust settings (Anderson et al., 2005, Wey et al., 2007, Kinsey, 2009, Kinsey et al., 2011), but are nearly independent of FSC (e.g., Wilson et al., 2004, Kinsey, 2009). During the EXCAVATE campaign, Anderson et al. (2005) concluded that black carbon emission indices increase significantly from idle to cruise power. These findings are also consistent with the results of the APEX campaigns: Wey et al. (2007) and Kinsey et al. (2011) reported that BC emissions are minimum at low power and increase with thrust settings, reaching values more than 0.3 g kg Fuel\u22121 at power levels higher than 85% F00 and dominating the total mass emissions. Agrawal et al. (2008) reported that the carbonaceous PM composition (EC + OC mass) significantly increases with power and shifts from OC-rich at idle to EC-rich with rising thrust regimes. Similar findings were observed by Petzold and Schr\u00f6der (1998), who indicated that the ratio of BC to total carbon ranged from 11% at idle to >80% at take-off thrust. This result is predictable when considering that the highest emissions of hydrocarbons occur at low power. Presto et al. (2011) recently investigated both the elemental carbon and the organic aerosol emitted by a CFM56-series engine at varying thrust settings after the exhaust using a smog chamber. Their findings confirmed the U-shaped curves of PM emissions versus thrust commonly reported in the literature, but also added new important knowledge on the relative contributes of EC and OA. At low power (4%\u20137% F00), most PM is composed of OA, while at 30% thrust very low emissions of both elemental and organic components were observed. At climb power (85%), an abrupt increase of EI(PM) occurred, mainly driven by EC, which accounted for about two thirds of the total PM.",

Besides the lighter PAHs, which mainly partition in the gaseous phase, the heavier congeners are principally in the particulate phase and generally also have the highest carcinogenic and mutagenic potencies (Delgado-Saborit et al., 2011). Hu et al. (2009) studied the effect of aircraft movements at a site located 100 m downwind of the regional airport of Santa Monica and reported spikes in concentration of particle-bound PAHs occurring during jet take-offs (440 ng m\u22123, i.e. 90 times the local background levels), however they did not detect significantly higher average levels of PAHs at airports. It is interesting to note that PAH emissions at airports may also undergo local deposition. In a study carried out at Delhi International Airport, Ray et al. (2008) observed that PAH contamination in the <2 mm surface soil layer reached maximum levels at a site near the landing area. The presence of PM-bound hopanes and steranes is also intriguing because these compounds are present in crude oil and are also largely used as molecular markers of vehicle emissions (e.g., Zielinska et al., 2004, Kam et al., 2012). Additional insights are therefore necessary for the characterisation of these organic compounds, which can derive either from the unburned fuel or from the emission of lubricating oils, which was hypothesised to have an important role in the mass of organic PM (Yu et al., 2010).",

However, the ICAO databank requires that an exhaust opacity metric called the smoke number (SN) is measured for TF engines. SN was defined as a \u201cdimensionless term quantifying smoke emission level based upon the staining of a filter by the reference mass of exhaust gas sample and rated on a scale of 0\u2013100\u201d (ICAO, 2008). SN was firstly collected on a filter by flowing a defined volume of the exhaust gas (12\u201321 kg of exhaust gas per square metre of filter) by a sample probe positioned directly behind the engine nozzle and inside the exhaust jet. The degree of attenuation of the filter before and after the sampling was thus measured using a reflectometer, and the SN was computed as:SN=100\u00b7(1\u2212Rf/R0)where R\n0 and R\nf are the absolute reflectance of the filter before and after the sampling, respectively. Unfortunately, SN gives only a qualitative estimate of particle emission and was recognised to be dependent on sampling conditions, soot characteristics and morphology, and therefore was assumed to have little value for estimating atmospheric impacts (Anderson et al., 2005). Moreover, it was reported that particles with a diameter less than 300 nm passed through the filter and therefore only the larger particles are collected resulting in a relative weak accuracy of measurement (Kugele et al., 2005).",

Although this calculation was reported to be dependent upon the mode-specific SN recorded in the engine databank (e.g., Stettler et al., 2011), recently Stettler et al. (2013b) observed that the correlation between BC and SN depends on the particle size distribution and that the methods suggested to convert SN to BC could lead to heavy underestimations of BC concentrations. An alternative method independent of the SN (FOX) was also recently developed and first studies reported an improved estimation of BC (Stettler et al., 2013a), but it needs to be further tested. To fill this gap, recently a group of experts was called to define new standard procedures for BC measurement at ground level for regulatory purposes (SAE, 2009). In the absence of defined standards, the scientific literature offers a number of studies on the emission of soot, BC and EC.",

As for most hydrocarbons, ions may undergo gas-to-particle partitioning and some species may further derive from chemical reactions in the atmosphere or on the filter surface. For example, the concentrations of aerosol nitrate can be affected by the adsorption of nitric acid gas on pre-existing particles, while evaporative losses occur at temperatures >20 \u00b0C and the exhaust plumes largely exceed this temperature. In addition, sulphate may form quickly due to the oxidation of SO2, coating soot particles. In view of this, Anderson et al. (2005) firstly reported that the concentration of sulphate aerosol rose considerably as sampling was performed progressively downstream of the engine, suggesting that sulphate particles may originate or undergo rapid growth within aircraft exhaust plumes. These findings were further confirmed by APEX campaigns. Agrawal et al. (2008) noted that the mass of the ions collected at 1 m from the engine exit plane were below the detection limit for most ions, while only sulphate was detectable. On the contrary, APEX samplings at 30 m reported EI(ions) in the range of 30\u201340 mg kg Fuel\u22121 dominated by sulphate (53%\u201372% of the total ion EIs) and ammonium (Kinsey et al., 2011).

During the APEX campaigns, the elemental composition of PM emitted from aircraft engines was analysed for a number of different aircraft engines. The total elemental emissions (sum of Mg, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Ag, In, Sb, Te, I, Tl) were in the range of 6.3\u201327.5 mg elements kg Fuel\u22121, corresponding to 2\u20137% of the total emitted PM and were dominated by sulphur (54%\u201380% of total element mass) (Kinsey, 2009, Kinsey et al., 2011).

While the small spherical particles have been linked to the combustion processes of engines, the latter irregular particles have been linked to a diverse range of sources, including tyre wear, fine dusts, vehicular traffic, and possibly engine wear.",

            "text": "Tyre and brake wear during landing and runway dust re-suspension have been estimated to be major sources of particulate matter. This is expected as smoke is clearly visible to the naked eye when aircraft wheels contact the ground and spin up to the landing velocity. Despite that, the proportion of the mass lost from aircraft tyres and brakes that becomes suspended as fine PM has not been extensively studied; the few available data indicate that the rubber lost from tyre wear can vary from few grams to \u223c0.8 kg per landing (Morris, 2006, Bennett et al., 2011 and references therein). Particulate emissions from tyres have been suggested to be dependent upon the maximum take-off weight, but other factors may have a role in the rubber wear, e.g., number of wheels, weather conditions, engine type, airport runway length and taxiway layout and operating procedures (Morris, 2006). The subsequent activation of brakes to bring the aircraft to a stop may further abrade brake lining material from discs and pads and may release fine particles as for road vehicles (e.g., Pant and Harrison, 2013). From a physicochemical point of view, it is plausible that brake wear includes both the emission of material from the abrasion of discs and the volatilisation and condensation of brake pad materials, while soot may arise from the thermal degradation of tyre polymers. This was confirmed by experimental data collected at a major European airport: Amato et al. (2010) reported unusually high levels of both organic carbon and metals possibly sourced from tyre detritus/smoke in runway dust (Ba, Zn, Mo) and from brake dust in ambient PM10 (Cu, Sb). In addition to tyre and brake wear, landing field wear and re-suspension can also occur, as usually aircraft land on a runway generally constructed of asphalt, concrete, gravel or grass.",

Aluminium alloys have a microstructure that can be highly susceptible to intergranular and pitting corrosion, and weathering is recognised as a major cause of structural damage to aircraft structure and coatings (Usmani and Donley, 2002, Russo et al., 2009: Knight et al., 2011), along with long term operations (Ostash et al., 2006), runway de-icing chemicals (Huttunen-Saarivirta et al., 2011) and atmospheric pollution and salts (Cole and Paterson, 2009). The degradation of aircraft mechanical components is also connected with mechanical, and corrosion-mechanical (macrocracks) defects, which lead to a decrease in its load-bearing capacity (Ostash et al., 2006). Corrosion has many forms and affects most structural alloys found in airframes: of particular importance is pitting and intergranular corrosion, which can develop into fatigue cracks, stress corrosion cracks or exfoliation (Liao et al., 2008). In this light, it is plausible that corrosion and mechanical stress of some aircraft components may release metallic particles into the environment. For example, using scanning electron microscopy techniques, Amato et al. (2010) founded the relatively common presence of platy aluminous particles derived from airframe corrosion in the ambient PM10 samples collected near the El Prat airport in Barcelona.",

Aircraft lubricating oils are usually composed of a mixture of synthetic C5\u2013C10 fatty acid esters of pentaerythritol and dipentaerythritol with specialised additives (Yu et al., 2010, Yu et al., 2012). Some of these, such as tricresyl phosphate, are recognised as toxic to humans (Craig and Barth, 1999, Van Netten, 1999, Winder and Balouet, 2002: Marsillach et al., 2011) and have been detected in ambient air and aircraft cabins, posing a risk for aviation technicians, loaders, crew and passengers in case of release into the environment (e.g., Solbu et al., 2010, Liyasova et al., 2011, Denola et al., 2011, Schindler et al., 2013). Yu et al. (2010) reported that the degree of degradation of lubrication oil during aircraft engine operations as a result of friction and/or pyrolysis might be negligible, suggesting that most emitted oil is unburned. Because of its low volatility, unburned lubricating oil may exit from engines as vapour or submicrometre droplets and may further condense and add mass to the organic PM in the wake of the aircraft. Results of exhaust characterisation measurements suggest that the contribution of lubrication system releases to the organic PM may be greater than the engine exhaust (Timko et al., 2010b): they estimated that the contribution of oil leaks to the total mass of organics generally lies within the range 10\u201320% for low thrust and 50% for high thrust settings. A recent study (Yu et al., 2012) has identified and quantified the lubricating oil in the particulate matter emissions from various engines of in-service commercial aircraft at two airports. This study used the characteristic mass marker of lubricating oil (ion fragment intensity between m/z = 85 and 71) to distinguish lubricating oil from jet engine combustion products. Results revealed that lubricating oil is commonly present in organic PM emissions in association with emitted soot particles, unlike the purely oil droplets observed at the lubrication system vent. The contribution from lubricating oil in aircraft plumes was observed to vary from 5% to 100% in measured aircraft plumes.",

Despite APUs being installed in all modern airliners so as to be energetically independent, their use is becoming less significant over time due to the increasing trend toward mains supplied ground power units (GPU) (Mazaheri et al., 2011). This ground equipment is supplied by the airports and includes diesel powered tugs of various types, ground carts, and also APUs installed on ground carts (e.g., Kinsey et al., 2012b). Some airports also provide electrical power to the aircraft by connecting directly to the ground network and by using fixed ground electrical power (FGEP) units. This system avoids the use of fuelled power units, with a subsequent reduction in local emissions and is thus very useful in airports not complying with air quality standards.",

However, the results are often conflicting. Sch\u00e4fer et al. (2003) indicated that APU emissions at airport service buildings cannot be neglected in comparison to the main engine emissions. The emission inventory of the airport of Zurich in 2004 (Fleuti and Hofmann, 2005) reported that although the aircraft exhaust accounted for most of CO, hydrocarbons and NOx (89%, 45%, 82%, respectively of total emissions), a significant percent was from APUs, GPUs, start-up-idle, handling/GSE, airside traffic and stationary sources, with APUs accounting for about half of the total non-aircraft engine emissions. HAL (2011) reported that 19% of the total NOx emissions of London Heathrow airport are due to the use of APUs. A survey over 325 airports in the USA (Ratliff et al., 2009) estimated the emissions from APUs and LTO cycles and stated that the greatest percentage that APUs contributed to total aircraft emissions was 10\u201315% for CO and between 15 and 30% for NOx and SOx. However, this study also reported that the airports used by a higher percentage of small and business jets tend to be affected by higher emissions from the APUs. Stettler et al. (2011) estimated that APUs contribute 6% to total PM2.5 emissions at major UK airports. The effect of the APUs upon public health was recently estimated by Yim et al. (2013), who calculated the emissions from aircraft LTO activity, aircraft APUs and GSE at the top 20 UK airports, ranked by passenger numbers. Their findings concluded that the ban on the use of APUs would prevent about 11 averted early deaths per year (90% confidence interval 7\u201316).",

Emissions from APU depend on many factors and are subject to change through provision of GPU facilities from the airport. Some airports have implemented policies to encourage the use of the GPU instead of APUs (Mazaheri et al., 2011 and reference therein), however in the absence of GPU availability, the use of APUs is still the only alternative to provide the energy for aircraft operations with engines off and for the ignition of the engines.

Moreover, the operation duration is expected to increase with increasing aircraft size. Other factors include the type of engines installed and the quality of fuels used and the status of the vehicle fleet (age, wear and tear). Therefore, it is not possible to identify the unique characteristics common to all the airports and ICAO databanks not include any information about GSE emissions. Similarly, the amount of road traffic in the form of private cars, taxis, shuttle bus and trucks for transporting people and goods in and out to the airport depends on the airport layout, on the quality of the road links and intermodal transport systems and, finally, is directly related to the number of passengers and goods that the airport handles.

(2007) calculated that NO concentrations at Zurich airport were dominated by emissions from ground support vehicles, while Unal et al. (2005) estimated that the impacts on ozone and PM2.5 of GSE at the Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International airport are small compared to the aircraft impacts. In addition, other miscellaneous sources may be also present at airports and may further increase the total pollutant load, including maintenance work, heating facilities, fugitive vapours from refuelling operations, kitchens and restaurants for passengers and operators, etc. Despite being intermittent and depending on the airport layout, these emissions may be dominant in certain circumstances. For example, Amato et al. (2010) reported that the local construction work for a new airport terminal in a major European airport (El Prat, Barcelona) was an important contributor to PM10 crustal dust levels along with road dust and aircraft re-suspension, with a clear drop during the weekends.",

Although at the current time, no specific target toxic compound has been identified to be used as a marker or indicator for human exposure to jet engine fuels and their combustion products (Tesseraux, 2004), it has been estimated that over 2 million civilian and military personnel per year are occupationally exposed to jet fuels and exhaust gases (Pleil et al., 2000, Ritchie, 2003, Cavallo et al., 2006). Kerosene-based fuels have the potential to cause acute or persistent neurotoxic effects from acute, sub-chronic, or chronic exposure of humans or animals (Ritchie et al., 2001), although evidence is lacking that current levels of exposure are harmful. Occupational exposure can occur by dermal, respiratory or oral ingestion routes of raw fuel, vapour, aerosol or exhausts. It has been postulated that chronic exposure to vapours and exhaust fumes could affect the operators inside the airport (Cavallo et al., 2006) and aircraft crew (Denola et al., 2011, Schindler et al., 2013), while occasional exposure can affect all passengers in transit (Liyasova et al., 2011). In addition, also the population living in the vicinity of airports can be exposed (Jung et al., 2011).",

Generally the results have highlighted the potential adverse effects of AEs on public health and also revealed the need for more extensive information about this source. Three estimates were given for US airports in 2005: Ratliff et al. (2009) analysed aircraft LTO emissions at 325 US airports with commercial activity and estimated that 160 (90% confidence interval 64\u2013270) premature deaths occurred due to ambient particulate matter exposure attributable to the aircraft emissions; Levy et al. (2012) estimated about 75 early deaths using activity data from 99 US airports; Ashok et al. (2013) estimated that aviation LTO emissions caused about 195 (90% confidence interval 80\u2013340) early deaths, while the same emissions were forecast to cause \u223c350 (90% confidence interval 145\u2013610) deaths in 2018. Arunachalam et al. (2011) used the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) to estimate the incremental contribution to PM2.5 due to commercial aviation emissions during LTO cycles in two major and one mid-sized US airport and reported that 8\u20139, 11\u201315 and 5 (depending on model resolution) premature deaths per year can be estimated for Atlanta, Chicago and Providence airports, respectively. In Europe, Yim et al. (2013) estimated that 110 (90% CI: 72\u2013160) early deaths occur in the UK each year (based on 2005 data) due to airport emissions. The same study also assessed that up to 65% of the health impacts of UK airports could be mitigated by replacing current fuel with low FSC fuel, by electrifying GSE, avoiding use of APUs and use of a single engine during the taxi phase. Lin et al. (2008) estimated that residents living within five miles of Rochester and La Guardia airports are affected by an increased relative risk of hospital admission of 1.47 and 1.38 respectively compared to resident living >5 miles distant. Jung et al. (2011) characterised the levels of BTEX in the vicinity of the Teterboro airport, New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, by exposing passive samplers for 48 h at the end of airport runways, in households close to the airport and out-of-neighbourhood locations. Results indicated that the average concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-/p-xylenes and o-xylene in neighbourhood concentrations (0.8, 3.8, 0.4, 1.2 and 0.4 \u03bcg m\u22123, each BTEX respectively) were not significantly different to those measured at the airport runways (0.8, 3.2, 0.3, 1, and 0.3 \u03bcg m\u22123, respectively) and higher than the out-of-neighbourhood locations (0.5, 1.1, 0.2, 0.8, and 0.4 \u03bcg m\u22123, respectively). Cavallo et al. (2006) characterised the exposure to PAHs in airport personnel and evaluated the genotoxic and oxidative effects in comparison with a selected control group. They analysed 23 PAHs collected from various areas over five working days and urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) following five working days as a biomarker of exposure. They reported an induction of sister chromatid exchange due to PAH exposure, although its health significance was not quantified.",

After thoroughly reviewing the latest available scientific literature, it can be concluded that the currently available information on the impact of AEs upon air quality is inadequate and the consequences of future growth in the volume of air traffic are very hard to predict. Most work has focussed upon aircraft engine exhaust during LTO cycles which accounts for a large proportion of the total emitted pollutants. However other sources such as the auxiliary power units, vehicular traffic and ground service equipment are known sources that may seriously affect air quality near to airports. In this way, it is apparent from the literature that while aircraft exhaust may account for most of the pollution at some airports, there are other sources that need to be addressed in more detail in the future, such as:\u2022tyre, brake, asphalt wear and the re-suspension of particles due to the turbulence created by aircraft movements;\u2022the emissions from the units providing power to the aircraft when required on the ground (APUs and GPUs);\u2022the ground support equipment that an airport offers as a service for flights and passengers, including passenger buses, baggage and food carts, container loaders, refilling trucks, cleaning, lavatory servicing and de/anti-icing vehicles, and tugs;\u2022the effects of the intermodal transportation systems, and road traffic for transporting people and goods in and out to the airport.\n",

            "text": "Most studies report that airport operations are responsible for significant emissions of a series of non-volatile, gaseous and semi-volatile species. Non-volatile emissions are made up of refractory material such as soot, which is emitted as PM even at high temperatures, but is also comprised of many organics and sulphur compounds, the latter mainly in the form of sulphate. Volatile emissions include compounds that exist as vapour at the engine exit plane and are made up of gaseous and vapour-phase pollutants, such as CO, NOx, SO2 and many organics (i.e. aromatics, alkanes, alkenes and a number of other VOCs). The less volatile fraction is of especial interest as it can react in the atmosphere and undergo gas-to-particle conversion by forming new particles or condensing on pre-existing ones.",

            "text": "The volatile emissions have mostly been fairly well characterised, but a comprehensive chemical speciation of the hydrocarbons and complete knowledge of their chemical processing in the atmosphere is still lacking. Detailed information on the non-volatile and semi-volatile compounds is also scarce. In spite of the increasing attention given to AEs, many issues remain unaddressed and represent a serious gap on which scientific research should focus. A list of the key characteristics of AEs that need to be carefully addressed should include:\u2022a careful quantification of sulphuric acid, HONO and HNO3 directly emitted by aircraft for a large variety of engines. Currently available data refer only to few engine types and the changes of EI at varying thrusts are not completely clear. This should also include seeking a better knowledge of the characteristics and the evolution of emitted chemi-ions and a better understanding of their role as a source of sulphur and nitrogen species in plumes;\u2022a more realistic quantification of emission inventories for nitrogen oxides and organic compounds, which includes the variability induced by the common practices of take-off and taxi phases at reduced thrust;\u2022quantification of the effects of ozone-precursors emitted from aircraft and other AEs on the levels of ground-level ozone at airports, which to date have not been thoroughly investigated. In particular, since well established atmospheric photochemical reactions of many VOCs are known as potential sources of elevated ozone concentrations in the troposphere, improved chemical speciation of organic compounds is much needed. Better apportionment of ozone formation potential from aircraft emissions during LTO cycles and from other AEs should be also estimated;\u2022standardisation of procedures for measurement of engine exhaust at ground level for regulatory purposes, which appear to be lacking mainly for PM and speciated hydrocarbon emissions. Such methodologies should take into account the semi-volatile components, which have been recognised to make a major contribution to the total mass of emitted PM. Achievement of this objective is vital to be able to obtain data that are comparable across different studies;\u2022further quantitative knowledge of the chemical and physical modifications affecting many compounds and particulate matter in the atmosphere, including the oxidation of hydrocarbons to less volatile species and the formation of sulphate on the surface of pre-existing particles;\u2022chemical and physical characterisation of PM. Far fewer data exist for PM than for the main gaseous pollutants. The chemical speciation of PM is not fully understood and the role of plumes aging on PM mass and composition is largely unknown. The role of lubrication oils, fuel type and engine technology, age and maintenance upon aircraft PM emissions also needs to be investigated;\u2022a more detailed assessment of the health effects of the AEs within and in the surroundings of major airports;\u2022the identification of particular chemical species to be used as a tracers for most of the AE sources;\u2022the significance of airport operations for emission reduction and management should be investigated in more depth. There is a lack of information on the effects of time-in-modes, aircraft waiting/idling durations, aircraft weight, and use of APU/GPU/FGEP on the actual emission of pollutants. A more detailed knowledge of such operations will lead to a more reliable assessment of the quantities of exhaust pollutants emitted into the air;\u2022the relative importance of near-airport, regional, and global scale air quality impacts of airport and aircraft emissions need to be further investigated. Most studies focus on local or global effects of the AEs, but there is no comprehensive view of air pollution over a full range of scales.\n",

This makes the signal of the AEs and, in particular, of aircraft emissions very hard to distinguish. This is a serious gap because development of cost-effective strategies to improve air quality to meet regulatory requirements demands a clear quantification of the contribution of AEs to the total air pollution.",
