In those publications, the median time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission was around 10 -11 days. The median time from illness onset to mechanical ventilation was 14.5 days, and the median time from illness onset to death was 18.5 days 1 . Zhou et al demonstrated that, in their retrospective cohort study, 32 Wuhan patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died with Extracorporeal Membraneous Oxygenation (ECMO) was used in 3 patients who all died. The ICU length of stay in nonsurvivors was a median of 8 days (range 4-12 days). A more comprehensive analysis by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the case fatality rate, across China, for patients admitted to intensive care was 49% (2087 admitted to ICU out of the 72,314 patients) 4 .",

Figure 1 demonstrates that, when patients are aligned from their lowest PF ratio day, there are similar trajectories in the survivors and non-survivors. Non-survivors start with a lower PF ratio than survivors, but PF nadir alone does not determine death as ratios recover in both groups. Survivor PF ratios improve to a greater extent than that of non-survivors. Lymphocytes also recover with little to be gleaned from absolute values whereas there appears a trend in ferritin levels that differentiate survivors from non-suvivors; ferritin levels are initially higher in non-survivors and plateau unlike survivors whose values recover from their zenith.

The timing of renal replacement therapy is statistically significant; non-survivors required renal support at mean day -8 compared to survivors on mean day +1 (p < 0.05) ARDSnet defined severe ARDS as a PF ratio < 13.3 kPa (100mmHg) with the PROSEVA trial's cut-off for proning being a PF ratio < 20 kPa (150mmHg) 9,10 . Taking these cut-offs into consideration, the majority of the survivors presented in this case series do not improve beyond severe ARDS criteria until day 20 -25 after symptom onset and do not improve beyond PROSEVA's proning cutoff until much later. In both groups, the amount of organ support required as their disease progresses increases and peaks at the day coinciding with the lowest PF ratio. In survivors this level of support is maintained and stabilises until approximately day 10 post lowest PF ratio. Interestingly, vasopressor usage (as defined as use of any noradrenaline, vasopressin or metaraminol) declines but renal replacement therapy increases post PF ratio trough.
