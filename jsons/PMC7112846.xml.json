When retinal degeneration susceptible (BALB/c) mice are injected intravitreally with a neurotropic strain (JHM) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a biphasic retinal disease develops. The acute phase (days 1\u20137 post-infection) is marked by inflammation and the presence of infectious virus and viral proteins, and a late/chronic phase (day 10\u2013several months post-infection) that is characterized by the absence of infectious virus and retinal degeneration (Robbins et al., 1990b, Robbins et al., 1991). In contrast, when retinal degeneration resistant (CD-1) mice were infected in the same manner, they developed only the acute phase of the disease (Wang et al., 1996).",

Some sera stained fibers spanning the neural retina, a pattern reminiscent of a M\u00fcller cell, and is similar to the pattern seen 4 dpi when staining with virus specific antiserum (Robbins et al., 1990a).

Like erythroid spectrin, nonerythroid spectrin, also called fodrin, consists of heterodimers of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Two forms of fodrin have been found in the retina of mice, differing only in the \u03b2 subunits. Immunoreactivity to fodrin occurred in the cytoplasm of cell bodies in the INL and ganglion cell layer.

According to Frus et al., detected autoantibodies to \u03b1-fodrin were detected in sera from patients with normal-pressure glaucoma. These investigators also discovered that the autoantibodies had high reactivity to a 120 kDa fragment of \u03b1-fodrin and less activity to a 150 kDa fragment of \u03b1-fodrin. The 120 kDa \u03b1-fodrin breakdown product results specifically from cleavage by caspase-3 (Janicke et al., 1998), and the 150 kDa \u03b1-fodrin fragment results from breakdown of \u03b1-fodrin by calpain (Dutta et al., 2002). Tahzib and co-workers demonstrated that caspase-3 was activated in a chronic ocular hypertensive rat model of glaucoma resulting in cleavage of \u03b1-fodrin to a 120 kDa fragment (Tahzib et al., 2004).",

ECOR susceptible mice may produce antibodies to \u03b1-fodrin due to damage caused by the viral infection which could include chronic activation of caspases and calpain.

A splenocyte population that was enriched for CD4 T cells also proliferated when exposed to purified antigen. This population of CD4 T cells could also contribute to retinal degeneration in ECOR possibly by altering the cytokine/chemokine environment in the retina to either cause direct damage to retinal cells or by increasing infiltration into the retina by other immune cells. CD4 T cells have been found to contribute to the development of disease in other models of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) (Wu et al., 2001) and autoimmune type 1 diabetes (Anderson and Bluestone, 2005). The same virus used to induce ECOR is also used to study a mouse model of MS. In this virus triggered MS model system, CD4 T cells appear to contribute more to the severity of clinical disease than CD8 T cells. Wu et al. also showed that macrophage infiltration into the CNS was greater in CD4 T cell enriched recipients. Studies by Lane et al. (2000) indicated that CD4 T cells played a role in demyelination by regulating the expression of RANTES and thus augmenting the infiltration of macrophages into the CNS.",

Villin 2 expression in vivo is usually restricted to the apical microvilli of epithelial cells and acts to link actin filaments to plasma membrane proteins (Berryman et al., 1993). In the eye, villin 2 is found in the apical microvilli of both M\u00fcller and RPE cells (Bonilha et al., 2006). Autoantibodies to villin 2 have not been found in any human autoimmune diseases, but autoantibodies to villin have been detected in patients with colon cancer (Rimm et al., 1995). Photoreceptor loss was noted in ezrin knockout mice and this loss was probably due to morphological defects in RPE and M\u00fcller cells since ezrin is not found in the photoreceptors (Bonilha et al., 2006). It is possible that autoantibodies to villin 2 could cause morphological changes in both the RPE and M\u00fcller cells and thereby could affect the function of the photoreceptors. We are presently working on expressing villin 2 in large quantities so that we can determine whether there is a population of splenocytes that will react to this antigen.",
