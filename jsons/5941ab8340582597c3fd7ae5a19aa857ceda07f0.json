            "text": "The recent worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been implicated in the development of a life-threatening, atypical pneumonia in humans. Several cases have been reported in pregnant women in Hong Kong, and isolated cases have been reported in Singapore and Canada. Recent microbiological evidence points to a novel coronavirus that is spread via contact or droplet transmission. Limited data are available regarding the epidemiology and natural history of this disease, and there is no published information regarding the outcomes associated with pregnancy. Given the apparent virulence of the SARS organism and the decrease in cell-mediated immunity associated with pregnancy, disease progression in pregnant women may be comparable to the more severe types of viral pneumonia that result in high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality rates. Given the significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality of viral pneumonia in pregnancy, SARS may impose greater risk in pregnant compared to non-pregnant individuals. Caring for SARS-affected pregnant women also poses several questions regarding labour and delivery management, as well as the protection of health care providers. We report outcomes of 10 women diagnosed with SARS during pregnancy from collaborating centres in Canada and Hong Kong. The clinical presentation of SARS in pregnant women is described. Sixty percent of pregnant women with SARS required intubation. Thirty percent of patients were delivered preterm. The rate of Caesarean section was 60%. Three maternal deaths were reported. We also describe our centre's approach to labour and delivery suite organisation in view of caring for SARS-exposed and affected pregnant individuals, as well as the management of exposed neonates.",

During the course of the pregnancy, 45 (18%) out of 252 completed gestations were complicated by adverse cardiovascular events (congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and stroke). Poor maternal functional class or cyanosis, myocardial dysfunction, left heart obstruction, prior arrhythmia, and prior cardiac events were predictive of maternal cardiac complications. These prior predictors were converted into a point score. If a point score was 0, 1, or more than 1, the risk of a patient developing an adverse cardiac event, was 5, 27, and 75%, respectively. The Canadian Prospective Multicentre Study allowed validation and simplification of this prediction rule. In this study, 13 centres prospectively recruited 599 patients with Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology 2004; 44: 177 -181 completed gestations. Similar factors were identified that predicted adverse cardiac events. In addition neonatal complications (20% of pregnancies) were associated with poor functional class or cyanosis, left heart obstruction, anticoagulation, smoking, and multiple gestation. A sample of this prospective cohort (302 pregnancies) was compared to 572 matched pregnancies with no underlying heart disease. The neonatal complication rate was higher in the study group when compared to controls, 18 verus 7%, respectively. The highest neonatal complication rate (33%) was seen in gravidas with underlying heart disease, who had previously identified cardiac risk factors, who were at both extremes of reproductive age, who had obstetrical risk factors, who smoked, or who received anticoagulants.",

We set out to assess the predictive capacity of a two step screening process. Methods: In our institution women with an unexplained elevated mid-trimester hCG level (= 4.0 MoM) are offered uterine artery Doppler assessment at 22-24 weeks' gestation. We have audited the utility of this practice by reviewing the prevalence of the adverse outcomes of gestational hyertension, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preterm birth. Results: Sixty-two women had a serum hCG = 4.0 M0M and underwent Doppler study of uterine artery flow velocity waveform (Ut AFVW). Notching of the Ut AFVW afforded better predictive utility for any outcome than the resistance index (RI) alone or in combination with notching. For a composite adverse outcome of gestational hypertension, birthweight = 10th centile and preterm delivery (<36 weeks) the presence of a uterine notch alone had sensitivity of 30.7%, specificity of 93.8%, a positive likelihood ratio of 4.95 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.7. For the identification of severe fetal growth restriction, <5th centile, and pre-eclampsia, the presence of a notch offered a sensitivity of 50%, specificity of 96.3%, a positive likelihood ratio of 13.5 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.5. Conclusions: The identification of uterine artery notching by Doppler ultrasound as a component of the surveillance of women with unexplained elevated hCG levels significantly improves the prediction of pre-eclampsia and severe IUGR.",

For each activity we identified potential problems (failure modes), defined their causes and surmised the effects if failures occurred. Numerical scores were assigned for the likelihood of failure occurrence and the severity of the effects. These scores were multiplied and reported as a risk priority number (RPN) for each failure mode. Solutions and monitoring plans were developed to address the failure modes with the highest RPNs.",

To determine in a longitudinal study whether GSTA1-1 is a useful marker for obstetric cholestasis (OC) and whether it distinguishes between OC and pruritus gravidarum (PG). Statement of method: Serum GSTA1-1 was measured in 54 women who developed OC at a median gestation of 33.7 weeks (range 21-40.7) (those on ursodeoxycholic acid were excluded); 29 with PG and 22 with normal pregnancy. Serum was sampled at least three times between 16 weeks' gestation and delivery. Summary of Results: GSTA1-1 increased with gestation in the OC group (but not the other groups) and was significantly greater by 24 weeks' gestation than in normal pregnancy and PG. In the OC group there was a highly significant correlation (P < 0.0001) between GSTA1-1 level and alanine aminotransferase (Spearman's rank correlation: r = 0.764), and total",
