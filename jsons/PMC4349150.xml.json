            "text": "Noroviruses are responsible for over half of the outbreaks of gastroenteritis worldwide (Karst, 2010). They belong to the Caliciviridae, a family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with a \u223c7.5 kb genome that generally contains three open reading frames (ORF) (Jiang et al., 1993; Lambden et al., 1993; Glass et al., 2000); a novel fourth ORF was recently identified in Murine norovirus (MNV) (McFadden et al., 2011). Whereas ORF2, ORF3 and ORF4 each encode single proteins, ORF1 codes for a large polyprotein (\u223c190 kDa) that is processed by the virally-encoded protease at five specific sites to release the six \u2018mature\u2019 non-structural proteins (NS1/2\u2013NS7)\u2014and an array of functional precursors\u2014that are required for virus replication (Belliot et al., 2003; Sosnovtsev et al., 2006; Muhaxhiri et al., 2013). The viral NS6 protease present within the C-terminal half of the polyprotein performs all the processing, including its own autocatalytic release from the precursor (Liu, Clarke & Lambden, 1996; Belliot et al., 2003; Sosnovtsev et al., 2006; Scheffler et al., 2007).",

The solution structure and dynamics of Norwalk virus NS6 have also been analysed by NMR spectroscopy (Takahashi et al., 2013). Norovirus NS6 is a cysteine protease with a chymotrypsin-like fold: two \u03b2-barrel domains separated by a cleft that contains a Cys-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad similar in arrangement to the Ser-His-Asp triad characteristic of serine proteases (Allaire et al., 1994; Matthews et al., 1994). Calicivirus NS6 is related in sequence and structure to the picornavirus 3C proteases, which have the same role in polyprotein processing for these single-stranded RNA viruses (Leen, Baeza & Curry, 2012).",

Strikingly, adventitious crystal contacts placed the C-terminus of one molecule in the active site of another, thereby generating the structure of a protease-product complex that plausibly represents the final step of the trans cleavage by NS6 at the NS6\u2013NS7 junction. An almost identical packing arrangement was obtained in a different space-group with crystals of Norwalk virus NS6 protease (Muhaxhiri et al., 2013). These structures, together with the structures of di-, tri- and penta-peptidyl substrate analogues bound to human norovirus NS6 structures (Hussey et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2012; Muhaxhiri et al., 2013) revealed details of the specific contacts made by the P5-P1 residues of peptidyl products of the protease (Fig. 1); in particular they showed the anchoring of P1-Gln by specific H-bond interactions with Thr 134 and His 157 (Fig. 1A), and the accommodation of the hydrophobic side-chains of P2\u2013Phe and P4-Leu in apolar pockets (Fig. 1B). However, to date there are no structural data on protease\u2013substrate complexes that might uncover details of the interactions made by the protease with the C-terminal, prime side of noroviral peptide cleavage junctions (residues P1\u2032-P4\u2032).",

To this end we extended an inactive MNV NS6 construct (which incorporates a C139A mutation to knock out the active site nucleophile) by adding residues from NS7, which is immediately downstream in the polyprotein. We made three constructs, NS6 1\u2032, NS6 2\u2032 and NS6 4\u2032, which were extended by 1, 2 and 4 residues respectively, generating proteases that contain substrates that correspond to P4\u2013P1\u2032, P4-P2\u2032 and P4-P4\u2032 of the NS6\u2013NS7 cleavage junction. To investigate the structural variation in substrate recognition we also made an NS6 chimera which interchanged the residues P4-P4\u2032 of the NS6-7 cleavage junction with the sequence of the NS2-3 junction from MNV (NS6 4\u2032 2|3).",

Unfortunately, in no case did the packing arrangements involve insertion of the cleavage junction in the extended C-terminus into the active site of an adjacent protein in a way that allowed the formation of specific protease\u2013substrate interactions. The four new structures reported here therefore do not provide any new information on the mode of binding of the P1\u2032-P4\u2032 residues of junctions cleaved by MNV NS6. However they do confirm the MNV NS6 protease structure and, in at least one case, reveal the structure for the loop connecting \u03b2-strands cII and dII that was disordered in the previously reported structure (Leen, Baeza & Curry, 2012).",

Q80J95; residues 995-1177), inactivated by mutation of the active site Cys 139 to Ala (C139A) were generated by the polymerase chain reaction using the inactive full length MNV NS6 as a template (Leen, Baeza & Curry, 2012). The same forward primer was used throughout (5\u2032-CATCATGGATCCGCCCCAGTCTCCATCTGG). To create constructs extended by one (Gly; NS6 1\u2032), two (Gly-Pro; NS6 2\u2032) or four residues (Gly-Pro-Pro-Met; NS6 4\u2032) beyond the natural C-terminus of NS6, we used the reverse primers, 5\u2032-ATGATGAAGCTTAGCCCTGGAACTCCAGAGCCTCAA, 5\u2032-CATCATAAGCTTACGGGCCCTGGAACTCCAGAGCCTCAAGTGTGGGTTCT-CCGTGAGT and 5\u2032-CATCATAAGCTTACATCGGCGGGCCCTGGAACTCCAG-AGCCTCAAGTG respectively. To generate the chimera with the P4-P4\u2032 cleavage site of NS2-3 (NS6 4\u2032 2|3) the reverse primer 5\u2032-TACTACAAGCTTAATCAAACGGG-CCTTCCGCCTGCCAAGCCTCAAGTGTGGGTTCTCCGTGAGT was used. PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into the pETM-11 vector as described previously for full-length NS6 (Leen, Baeza & Curry, 2012). The expressed MNV NS6 variants thus contain a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal His6 tag; processing by thrombin leaves a Gly-Ser di-peptide preceding the Ala1 residue at the N-terminus of our constructs. All plasmid insert sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon). NS6 1\u2032 and NS6 2\u2032 constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (Stratagene) and grown in lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with 25 \u00b5g/mL kanamycin and 35 \u00b5g/mL chloramphenicol, while NS6 4\u2032 and NS6 4\u2032 2|3 constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Promega) and grown in LB supplemented with 25 \u00b5g/mL kanmycin and 35 \u00b5g/mL chloramphenicol. For large-scale protein expression, 1 L of LB was inoculated with overnight cultures. The cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 220 RPM and protein expression was induced for 3 to 4 h by addition of 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) once the cultures had attained an OD at 600 nm of 1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 min, and pellets frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C.",

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation of the bacteria lysate at 29,000 g for 1 h.

The lysate was loaded onto TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech, Mountain View, California, USA) in a gravity flow column. After washing with 25 volumes of lysis buffer, 25 volumes of lysis buffer containing 5 mM imidazole, and finally a further 25 volumes of lysis buffer containing 10 mM imidazole, the MNV NS6 proteins were eluted with a step gradient to 100 mM imidazole. The His6 tag was removed during overnight dialysis in lysis buffer in the presence 2 mM CaCl2, and 10 units of thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) per mg of MNV NS6 protein. Following dialysis, uncleaved material and cleaved tags were removed in a second round of TALON purification. As a final polishing step, the unbound fractions containing cleaved MNV NS6 variants were pooled, concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex-75 size-exclusion column (mounted on AKTA FPLC; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT (SEC buffer).",

For three of the four new structures (NS6 2\u2032, NS6 4\u2032 and NS6 4\u2032 2|3) it was possible to identify conserved crystal contacts, involving a two-fold symmetric packing arrangement largely mediated by the short N-terminal helix and the loop connecting \u03b2-strand aII and bII (Fig. 3B). In each case the C-terminus of at least one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit was observed to extend away from the body of the protease and to interact with a neighbouring molecule in the crystal\u2014as had been observed previously for MNV NS6. Moreover, the extended C-terminus invariably inserted into the peptide-binding groove formed between loops bII-cII and eII-fII loops (Fig. 4). Disappointingly, however, in no case did the extended peptide make interactions that were consistent with specific contacts with the protease active site. We will briefly describe each of the four new structures before turning to the question of why in no case a protease\u2013substrate complex was obtained.",

We had hoped to obtain the same packing interaction with the C-terminally extended complexes in order to determine the structures or protease\u2013substrate complexes that would reveal the details of the interactions made by the amino acids in positions P1\u2032-P4\u2032 of the substrate, but in each of the four cases that we probed, extension of the C-terminus resulted in novel packing arrangements, none of which captured a proper protease\u2013substrate reaction.",

Although we screened extensively for crystallisation conditions, we cannot claim to have searched exhaustively and it may be that further efforts might yet succeed. Moreover, it is well known that even very modest changes to protein constructs may alter substantially the way that they crystallise, though it is worth noting that a similar strategy to explore the specific interactions of different protease-product complexes was applied successfully to Norwalk virus NS6 (Muhaxhiri et al., 2013). In preliminary investigations using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to investigate solution structures of extended MNV NS6 protease structures, we have obtained evidence to suggest that their C-termini may have a propensity to fold into the active site of the molecule that it belongs to, making a cis interaction (H Fernandes, 2015, unpublished data). This may explain why trans interactions were not observed in our crystals but in turn raises a further question: why was this conformational state not captured in the crystal form? One possibility is that the concentration of proteins inevitably involved in crystallisation somehow destabilizes the cis interaction but does not necessarily capture a catalytically competent trans interaction between the cleavage junction within the extended C-terminus and a protease neighbour. Why this would be the case, particularly when a protease\u2013substrate complex would be expected to be a relatively stable state, remains a mystery.",
