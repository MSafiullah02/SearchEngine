For example, the Global Early Warning and Response System for Major Animal Diseases houses zoonoses information in its database and combines the alert and response mechanisms of the 3 organizations to avoid duplication and to coordinate verification processes. To accelerate shared communications and data analyses related to important animal diseases, including zoonoses, the World Organisation for Animal Health developed the World Animal Health Information System and Database.

In certain circumstances, deforestation, travel, globalization, climate change, and chemical pollution are catalysts behind ecological simplification, increased pathogen exposures, and immunosuppression that may all contribute to disease outbreaks [11, 12] . Heavy impacts can be seen in na\u20ac \u0131ve populations of humans and animals that are exposed to infectious diseases. The epidemic of West Nile virus infections affected birds, horses, and other mammals (including humans), as the disease spread across the United States, from the Northeast south, westward, and into the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central and South America. West Nile virus affected humans and animals in several ways: through mild to lethal infections, through the impacts of massive pesticide spraying, and through loss of confidence in governmental health agencies when they demonstrated limited success in stopping spread of the disease. More recently, the spread of Ebola, affecting wildlife and humans in several nations of West Africa, triggered even greater concern because of the extraordinarily high case fatality rate in clinically affected people. Similarly, the Zika virus has garnered world-wide attention because of its potential impacts on pregnant women and unborn children. Important modes of cross-species contact were relevant in West Nile, Zika, and Ebola outbreaks, as well as in other infectious diseases that pose ongoing concerns. Transport related to trade and travel (e.g., via airplanes, ships, trains, buses, trucks, and automobiles) moves vectors and infected hosts more rapidly than in any previous era [13] . Also of great importance are instances of direct transmission of pathogens from animals to humans that result from human encroachment into wildlife habitats. Settlements, roads, deforestation, and agriculture fragment and eliminate wildlife habitat, bringing humans, domestic animals, and wildlife into closer contact. Bush-meat (i.e., wild game) collection, processing, and sales increase risks of direct pathogen transfers. One Health must include both infectious and toxicological diseases [14] .

A changing climate often results in disease transmission into new regions. Warmer climates promote the spread of vectors of infectious disease from more tropical ranges to temperate areas, as seen with such diseases as malaria, Chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, and dengue fever. In other instances, vectors are able to live at higher latitudes than in the past, carrying pathogens to immunologically na\u20ac \u0131ve species adapted to those areas [15] .

A Pellston workshop entitled Interconnections Between Human Health and Ecological Integrity was held in 2000. Jointly sponsored by SETAC and the Society of Toxicology, the workshop was motivated by the concern of human-health, environmental, and social scientists for the interconnections between the condition of natural ecosystems and human health [19] . The goal of the workshop was to initiate substantive yet broadly considered explorations of these interconnections, including creative transdisciplinary approaches for solving environmental problems at this interface. Major themes included the biological basis of similarities and differences between human health and ecosystem quality; how the environment shapes the human sense of well-being and vice versa; linkages among land-use patterns, ecological degradation, and human health; and Mercury poisoning remains a One Health concern because of decades of evidence of multispecies toxicity [28] . The classic story of mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay, Japan, began with the use of mercury as a catalyst in 1932, but emissions grew more serious when a new co-catalyst added in 1951 directly produced methyl mercury. Releases into the Bay were followed soon thereafter by observations of dead fish and fishermen complaining of reduced catches. By 1953, seabirds and crows spiraled into the sea, and the same year cats that consumed seafood from the Bay demonstrated severe incoordination and seizures. Then, in 1956, neurotoxicity was observed in children eating the seafood. In 1957, feeding the seafood to cats experimentally reproduced the syndrome. In 1959, the syndrome in children was diagnosed as methyl mercury poisoning, and the point source producer was identified in 1961; but the company continued releasing methyl mercury until 1968 [28] . Despite our knowledge of mercury's harm, it continues to pollute globally. The chemical is intentionally used in several products (e.g., compact fluorescent light bulbs, certain batteries) and activities (e.g., artisanal and small-scale gold mining, mercury-cell chloralkali process), and it remains a substantial byproduct of industrial activities such as coal-fired utilities, cement manufacturing, and waste incinerators. To monitor and protect wildlife, domestic animal, and human health, an integrated and comprehensive One Health approach is needed.

To improve problem recognition and definition, new tools for assessing and monitoring ecological health concerns are required. One possible approach is the development of some form of integrated ecological and human-health assessment that incorporates aspects of environmental indicator studies with specific biomedical diagnostic tools. These tools might include: the development of noninvasive and real-time physiological and behavioral monitoring techniques; the adaptation of modern molecular biological and biomedical techniques that provide early warnings and predict adverse outcomes; the design of population-level monitoring strategies; the creation of ecological and sentinel species surveillance approaches; and the adaptation of health monitoring systems for appropriate developing country situations [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1150, "end": 1154, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A Need for New Tools"}, {"text": "Opportunities for collaboration in One Health are increasing, and several areas of expertise within the SETAC membership already fall under the One Health umbrella. For example, investigation into the declines of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies and other pollinators is an extension of the One Health concept.

In the case of honey bees, potential causal factors of declines and die-offs include geographical translocations, pests, pathogens, and pesticides, sometimes acting in concert.

The adverse health impacts at hand warrant an infusion of interest and effort on the part of a wide array of SETAC experts. A logical approach of One Health is to focus multiple disciplines on understanding and counteracting shared stressors in given localities. In this regard, SETAC's Global Horizon Scanning Initiative, which was designed to identify geographically specific research needs to improve environmental quality, could be a catalyst for assembling
