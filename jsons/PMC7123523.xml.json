            "text": "Pediatric pharmacy technically includes the care of any patient under the age of 18 years, although practically patients over the age of 15 can usually be cared for following similar dosing/monitoring as in adults. In Canada in 2017, children under 12 years comprised ~15% of the Canadian population (Statistics Canada, Population by sex and age group 2017), and accounted for 6.4% of hospital discharges (~3% not including births in hospital) [1]. Approximately 50% of Canadian children receive one or more medications each year; this is up to 79% in infants <1 year old [2, 3]. While medication use is not uncommon, polypharmacy is much less common than in adult patients. Around 20% of US children received at least one medication in the previous week, but less than 6% had used two or more medications in the previous week [4, 5]. The most common medications filled for children in community pharmacies in 2012 included antibiotics (amoxicillin, azithromycin, and cefprozil most commonly), asthma medications (salbutamol, fluticasone, montelukast), and medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (methylphenidate primarily) [2].",

Gestational age (GA) is the duration of time a newborn has been in utero (full term is considered ~40 weeks) while post-natal age (PNA), also known as chronological age (CA), is the duration of time since birth (e.g., 2 weeks old). Corrected gestational age (CGA) or post-menstrual age (PMA) are terms used most commonly in infants born prematurely, and refer to their gestational age plus post-natal age. For instance, a baby born at 30 weeks GA, with a PNA/CA of 10 days would have a CGA/PMA of 31 weeks and 3 days (commonly abbreviated as 31 + 3 weeks). A neonate (or newborn) is an infant <28 days PNA/CA, or for premature infants, less than 44 weeks CGA/PMA. The term \u201cinfant\u201d typically refers to a range of PNA/CA from 28 days to 1 year. The term \u201ctoddler\u201d typically refers to age 1\u20133 years, and \u201cschool-age\u201d refers to age from 4 to 9 years. \u201cAdolescent\u201d typically refers to age 10\u201319 years, though the true onset of adolescence is determined by the onset of puberty. These distinctions are important due to developmental changes that occur in pharmacokinetics (see more below).",

Up to 90% of medication use in hospitalized children and 30% of medication use in ambulatory children are considered \u201coff-label,\u201d that is, not included in the product labeling/monograph and thus not supported by the manufacturer [2]. Only 25% of medications on the market are approved for children, and this number is even less for infants [6]. This results in a lack of detailed pharmacokinetic, dosing, adverse effect, and efficacy data for appropriate medication management in children. As well, due to the lack of studied indications in children, there is little impetus for manufacturers to make formulations appropriate for children and so formulation issues related to availability, palatability, excipients, or measurability are commonplace.",

Pharmacists should gather information on medical history, medication history, medical conditions, and any other relevant information, and then ensure that all medications are indicated, dosed appropriately, effective, safe, and adhered to. However, each of these steps contains nuances for infants and children.

While it is not surprising that there are pharmacokinetic differences between children and adults, there are also important differences between premature newborns, term newborns, infants, toddlers, school-age children, and adolescents. Table 28.1 provides a summary of major pharmacokinetic considerations in infants and children. This variability in pharmacokinetics makes dosing medications in children especially challenging as there is no \u201cstandard\u201d dose of a medication. Medication doses may vary based on CGA, PNA, as well as body weight or surface area. Most notable is the need to use neonatal (not pediatric) dosing in newborns as the first few months of life are characterized by rapidly changing organ function (renal and hepatic most importantly) as well as changes in drugs\u2019 volume of distribution.",

Childhood is typically characterized by excellent renal and hepatic clearance, even exceeding that of adults in some cases. Normal clearance values approach that of adults around adolescence. This is an oversimplification, given that different aspects of renal and hepatic clearance develop at different rates. Full reviews of pharmacokinetic differences in children can be found in Kearns et al. [10] and Bartelink et al. [11]. By selecting age-appropriate doses, the pharmacokinetic differences that occur throughout childhood are taken into account. All pharmacists should ensure that medication doses in children are age and/or weight appropriate by consulting neonatal and/or pediatric dosing references with each and every prescription.",

For instance, a mother using methadone for a substance abuse condition may result in her infant developing signs and symptoms of withdrawal several days after discharge home.

There is a greater focus on observation of signs and symptoms when determining a patients need or response to medications. While these observations have some degree of objectivity, many assessments done in this way may include some subjectivity. For this reason, other objective measures may be relied upon more frequently in younger children than in older children or adults. For instance, the objective presence of a fever and results of key lab values (e.g. normalization of white blood cell count) can supplement a parent\u2019s subjective report of a child feeling better and acting more \u201clike himself\u201d in an assessment of an infection\u2019s response to antibiotics. Pain scoring tools that include a measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, as well as an observation of the infants\u2019 behavior can add an objective component to a parent\u2019s assessment of their child\u2019s pain. There are a variety of pediatric-specific assessment tools for a variety of medical conditions and pharmacists should seek those out when needed. Table 28.2 includes some examples of condition-specific assessment tools for infants and children. It should be noted that dismissing a parent\u2019s assessment of their child due to its subjectivity is not advised. Caregivers know typical behavior in their children and slight changes in behavior (e.g., poor feeding, decreased energy, altered sleep) can be important signs of illness or adverse medication effects in children. Having said that, if subjective observations contradict objective measures, one should proceed with caution. When assessing a child\u2019s illness, there are some red flags that should illicit immediate referral to medical care. Table 28.3 depicts a list of the red flag symptoms that prompts referral in pediatric patients.",

Because normal ranges of serum creatinine in children are relatively wide, serum creatinine values can double, reflecting potential acute kidney injury, but remain in the \u201cnormal\u201d range. It is important therefore for pharmacists to follow trends in serum creatinine rather than just absolute values. In cases where the pharmacist needs to estimate renal function, the formula used in children differs from that used in adults. The most accurate and commonly used formula is called the \u201cBedside Schwartz\u201d formula. Equation 28.1 outlines this important formula. Estimation of GFR in infants and especially in newborns is challenging as renal function continues to develop rapidly after birth, with most infants reaching full renal function around 6 months of age. Again, following trends in serum creatinine (expecting a downward trend in the first 1\u20132 weeks of life) is the most effective method of assessing renal function. Other factors such as urine output and hydration should also be considered in the overall assessment of renal function.

Sputum cultures are challenging as contamination with saliva is common. It is therefore necessary to note the presence of endothelial cells and/or nasopharyngeal flora in these cultures as they may indicate a lack of appropriate specimen. Urinary samples, likewise, can be difficult to obtain appropriately without catheterization and thus have a higher likelihood of contamination by skin flora. Lastly, there is a higher rate of false-negative blood cultures. Blood cultures in children are typically limited to two bottles (adults typically use four bottles), and use smaller volumes of blood, resulting in a higher risk of false-negative results. The reduced number of bottles also makes distinguishing between pathogenic growth and contamination more difficult. In adults, growth of skin flora in one out of four blood culture bottles is typically associated with contamination; however in children growth of the same pathogen in one out of two bottles is less convincing as contamination. For these reasons, it is not uncommon to empirically treat a child for an infection despite negative cultures, purely based on signs and symptoms of infection. This represents a particular challenge for pharmacists attempting to tailor antibiotic therapy to infectious pathogens.
