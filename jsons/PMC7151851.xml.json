            "text": "\nAnthropoceneThe human-dominated era in which we now live. There is debate over when this started, but the most widespread views are either the mid-18th century when carbon dioxide levels started to rise sufficiently to alter Earth System function, due to the Industrial Revolution, or the first human created nuclear explosion, in 1945. The word combines the root \u201canthropo,\u201d meaning \u201chuman\u201d with the root \u201c-cene\", the standard suffix for \u201cepoch\u201d in geologic time.Ecosystem servicesThe benefits or \u201cservices\u201d which ecosystems (functionally linked combinations of species) provide to humans, either indirectly or directly. These are normally grouped into four: \u201csupporting\u201d (e.g. soil formation, nutrient recycling, and water purification), provisioning\u201d (e.g. food or fiber from crops or forests), \u201cregulating\u201d (e.g. the reduction in the harm, \u201cprovided\u201d by forests, wetlands and mangroves against floods, landslides, droughts and tsunamis), and \u201ccultural\u201d (e.g. aesthetic, recreational and spiritual benefits that humans derive from contact with some forms of nature).Energy return on energy investmentThe ratio of useful energy obtained to the energy expended in obtaining that useful energy. The concept is particularly associated with the work of systems ecologist Charles A.S. Hall.HealthA word derived from \u201cwhole\u201d referring to a desired and robust, resilient state of function, normally of humans, animals or plants, both individually and as populations. Some also apply the term to ecosystems, or even the Earth System.Limits to growthThe name of a study, commissioned by the Club of Rome and published as a book in 1972. It summarizes modelling work that explored the complex interactions between human civilization and the physical world in which it is inextricably embedded. The book\u2019s title reflects its main conclusion: on a finite planet, despite abundant solar energy, growth of the human enterprise is not infinite.Novel entityA term introduced and defined in 2015 as a planetary boundary, evolving from chemical pollution in previous planetary boundary publications. It was defined as \u201cforms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects.\u201dPlanetary boundariesEarth System processes, modifiable by human actions, whose boundaries, if not exceeded, constitute a \u201csafe operating space for humanity\u201d. This term, first published in 2009, is conceptually linked to the Limits to Growth framework.\n",

It was not the first work to grapple with the idea that physical limits apply to the human economic and social system, but it drew extensive attention and remains the best-selling environmental book of all time. The book summarized outcomes of modeling work that explored the complex interactions between human civilization and the physical world in which it is inextricably embedded. The MIT team concluded that significant systemic problems were emerging from accelerating industrialization, population growth, under-nutrition, the depletion of non-renewable resources and environmental contamination and decline.",

Specific pollutants that were well-measured at the time included carbon dioxide concentrations, nuclear wastes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) production, lead in the Greenland icecap and mercury consumption. Direct environmental decline was also seen in marine settings: diminishing dissolved oxygen in oceans, eutrophication of waterways and falling catches of wild fish in some regions. Land-use change (although a significant contributor to rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere then as now) and biodiversity loss were both less conspicuous problems in 1970 than they have since become; though a crisis in available arable land was then acknowledged.

These last runs, where all ameliorative options were adopted, were the only ones that allowed civilization to continue without crisis. If the human economy maintained business as usual, the team found, it would collide with the physical realities of a finite planet by the second half of the 21st century, triggering social collapse.",

Although these studies examined the outlook only as far as 2000, their conclusions to that date confirmed those of the original LTG study. Right from the start, however, economists were critical, even abusive, creating a negative impression that persists in some quarters, today\u2014despite the rapidly accumulating evidence of the basic robustness of the LTG projections and assumptions. Robert Gillette, who attended the LTG launch for the journal Science, noted that the \u201cassumption of inevitable economic growth\u201d represents \u201cthe very foundation\u201d of economics. Any \u201climit\u201d to growth challenged this foundation.

            "text": "The concept of the ecological footprint is among the most important developments in thinking related to the LTG. Devised in the 1990s by William Rees and Mathis Wackernagel, this measure enables ecological impacts (individual, national or global) to be quantified and compared. On one hand, it estimates the ecological assets required to produce the resources consumed by any discrete population; this includes food and fiber plants, livestock and fish, timber and other forest products, space for urban infrastructure and whatever \u201csinks\u201d are needed to absorb the waste produced, especially carbon dioxide emissions. The unit of measurement adopted is the area of biologically productive land and water, usually expressed in hectares. On the other hand, the ecological footprint also estimates the productivity of a country\u2019s actual ecological assets (cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land). Researchers using the ecological footprint methodology calculated that, while the world\u2019s biocapacity averages 1.7 ha. per capita, high-income \u201cdeveloped\u201d countries greatly exceed this average. Examples include the United States (8.8 ha. per capita) and the United Kingdom (5.1 ha. per capita). The US, which has far more productive land available than the United Kingdom, appropriates 1.27 times its own biocapacity through imports, and the United Kingdom almost three times. Many island nations and arid countries such as Saudi Arabia exceed their biocapacity by a factor of more than ten. The ecological footprint has the strengths and weaknesses of any aggregate indicator: the concepts and units are easy to understand by policy-makers and the public, but it does not encompass all aspects of human environmental impact (methane, e.g., is not integrated). This matrix needs to be used in conjunction with other indicators.",

Biological diversity of lower order organisms (within soils, among pollinators, and in the species traditionally utilized for plant-origin food, resources and medicines) are similarly in decline. Also under deliberate attack are forests, especially species with valuable timber, or growing on land that can be used for crops, including oil palm. Many forests are also at unintended risk, due to roads and global warming, each of which also exacerbates the risk of fire. Global warming is also likely to further hasten biodiversity loss. In some cases biodiversity decline and climate change, acting together or independently, also promote the survival of new pests.

Millions of people living in poverty, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, suffer multi-system consequences of air pollution, both indoor and outdoor, from smoke generated by their own household and by other households. In many locations, this is aggravated by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Many people, particularly women and children, undertake daily laborious effort to obtain fuel and water. Access to electrical power, and even gas for cooking would bring significant improvements in health to the 1.3 billion people living without electricity.",

            "text": "Probably the least understood aspect of limits to growth is the concept and importance of declining energy return on energy investment (EROEI). The number given for EROEI is the ratio of useful energy obtained versus primary energy expended (see Box 1\n).Box 1Energy return on energy investmentThe major energy carriers in use today are fossil fuels, especially coal, oil and gas. These are used not only for transport, heating and electrical power (over 60% globally), but also as a chemical stock to manufacture plastics and to make fertilizer. But, just as in the past when our ancestors bred, trained, housed and fed donkeys and draft horses for assistance with laborious tasks, fossil fuel needs to be wrested from the environment, whether drilled for, dug by hand or removed by robotic shovels. These processes themselves take energy. In addition, energy released or captured from these sources needs to be distributed and the infrastructure to do that needs to be maintained. Coal needs to be transported and burned, with some of its energy captured through combustion. Electrical energy needs to be distributed and regulated irrespective of its source (including solar, wind, hydro and tidal). To manufacture wind turbines or solar panels requires energy, as does the mining infrastructure described above. Life-cycle assessment allows a full quantification of the energy invested in any form of energy extracted, which is clearly significant.In the heyday of fossil fuels, oil and coal were easy to extract, and their EROEI was high\u2014some analysts report an average EROEI of over 100 in the late 19th century. In contrast, a review published in 2016 in Nature Communications found that, globally, up until 2017, solar panels may have yielded no energy beyond that required for their manufacture and installation. In other words, under the least optimistic scenario, solar panels, cumulatively, have been a sink for energy, rather than a source until very recently. More encouragingly, the EROEI for solar appears to have increased considerably in the last decade, perhaps to 30 or 35, especially in locations with high insolation, such as in the tropics. The climate footprint of solar is much lower than of coal and will continue to decline, especially as the efficiency of panels increases and the electricity they generate is used to manufacture additional ones.The EROEI for wind is widely agreed to be even higher than for solar, so these two sources have promise as major substitutes for fossil fuel energy, even though researchers still debate whether renewables will yield energy abundant enough to fuel the current consumption-oriented economy. In addition, Ugo Bardi and Sgouris Sgouridis argue that the window for a successful transition is narrow: a very large investment of available energy is required, while still maintaining adequate energy for ongoing services. Moreover, the world\u2019s economic system may fail to allocate the necessary resources in the necessary timeframe (by 2050 in this analysis). Bardi and Sgouridis are skeptical that market forces can effect this transition. They calculated that, as of 2017, capital investment is only about one tenth of what is required. Energy investment is also inadequate. Though not impossible, any transition to renewables will be challenging and requires a substantially greater rate of energy and capital investment than is currently allocated.Alt-text: Box 1",

These risks are escalating and we recognize the shortfall in assessing the health risk of new pollutants, entities and behaviors. When considered together with economic and population growth, and with ever-increasing resource and energy use, these environmental health risks may foreshadow significant population decline. By using the LTG and PB frameworks in this contribution, society can frame preventative measures on the scale at which this is required.
