Since bats are known animal vectors for all but one of the known lyssavirus genotypes, we have performed an extensive survey of bats in the Guangxi Province to provide information on lyssavirus distribution in southern China. The lyssavirus nucleoprotein gene was detected in brains of 2.86 % of 2,969 bats. Nucleotide sequence homologies among isolates were 86.9-99.6 %, but only 70.0-85.0 % for lyssaviruses in GenBank. These infected bats were detected from a wide area, essentially forming a band running from the south-west to the north-east of Guangxi, and it appears that infection by new lyssaviruses is widespread in this region.",

Thus, control of rabies is now one of the most important public health concerns in the country. While dog bites are undoubtedly the current principal mechanism for current human rabies infection, wild animal populations represent a potentially large reservoir for rabies and other lyssaviruses. Apart from rabies, the other lyssaviruses have not been studied sufficiently for their potential host range and pathogenicity to be evaluated. However, each of lyssavirus genotypes 2-7 is currently limited to a particular geographical area; Lagos bat virus (LBV) [2] , Mokola virus (MOKV) [3] , and Duvenhage virus (DUVV) [4] are found in Africa, the European bat virus-1 (EBLV-1) [5] and European bat virus-2 (EBLV-2) [6] have been isolated from European animals, and the Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) [7] has been detected on the Australian continent. The rabies virus is the only lyssavirus that has been detected in the Americas.",

Although antibodies to the rabies virus have been detected in sera of bats from southern China [9] , and no infections with lyssavirus Genotypes 2-7 have been reported in any animal or human in China, concern has been raised by the recent isolation of four new viruses (Aravan [10] , Khujand [11] , Irkut [12] , and West Caucasian bat viruses [13] ) from bats in Eurasia. These have been incorporated as putative species within the lyssaviruses Genus in the Virus Taxonomy VIIIth Report [14] , and will thus probably eventually become lyssavirus genotypes [8] [9] [10] [11] . More recent, new lyssaviruses were found in Shimoni bat [15] , Natterer's bat [16] , and in African civet [17] . Probable lyssavirus infections have also been discovered in the sera of bat specimens from several countries in Southeast Asia, namely the Philippines, Cambodia, Thailand, and Bangladesh [18] [19] [20] [21] . Virus neutralizing activity of African fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) sera against emerging lyssaviruses was confirmed [22] . These samples indicated stronger neutralizing activity against bat viruses from Eurasian and ABLV than other lyssaviruses, but it was not possible to isolate the virus, or to detect the viral genome in any of these investigations.",

However, the other lyssaviruses have not been studied sufficiently for their potential host range and pathogenicity to be evaluated. Furthermore, there is very little information available on bat lyssaviruses in Asia, except for the identification of antibodies to ABLV in sera of Philippine bats [18] , and antibodies to the rabies virus in sera of bats from southern China [9] . Since China is a country with a severe prevalence of rabies, it is an important public health issue for the background incidence levels of bat rabies or other lyssaviruses to be established. Our present study has focused on bats from the different regions of Guangxi in southern China, and results from 2,969 bats of six species collected from (Table 1) . These positive samples were distributed in seven regions: Chongzuo, Baise, Nanning, Guigang, Liuzhou, Guilin, and Hezhou, and spread like a band from southwest to northeast Guangxi (Fig. 1) . The high incidence of N gene detection in Liuzhou and Guilin (6.28 and 7.53 %, respectively) is especially worthy of note. Most investigators typically discover 1 rabid bat per 1,000 samples of dead or normal animals, however, our results showed 2.86 % positive samples. Because most of bat samples were dead and alive fell onto ground, therefore, the incidence of lyssavirus in these bat samples might be higher than that of normal bats (Table 1) . Nevertheless, no antigenic positive sample was confirmed when these positive samples were further investigated by IFA using an anti-N protein monoclonal antibody with reactivity for rabies and related viruses.",

Consistent with previous studies on the evolution of lyssaviruses [29] , the strains of the rabies viruses found in Guangxi bats also show a distinct geographical distribution according to the sequencing analysis. Thus continued vigilance of wild animal populations is necessary because of the rapid rate at which such viral mutations can occur, and the possibility of the production of strains with the ability to cross species boundaries [30] . This research provides an initial insight into the biological properties of the rabies virus in bat populations of southern China, and represents a foundation on which to build an informed assessment of the potential risk of bats as vectors for transmission of infectious diseases to humans, which also include the emerging viral zoonoses, due to Ebola or Marburg virus [31] , Nipah virus [32] , Coronaviruses [33] , and Avian influenza virus [34] . Rabies encephalitis is known as a potential risk for transmission by bats [35] , but except for one case of rabies following a bat bite [36] , Asia is at present the only continent where battransmitted human rabies is not currently officially recognized as a problem. However, this may be in part the consequence of a lack of appropriate reporting. It is now widely believed that bat rabies is present throughout the world, and may have been present for a long time [37] . Therefore, since bats represent a reservoir for the maintenance and evolution of rabies and other lyssavirus genotypes, it is important to devote increased attention to evaluating their current status and predicting the potential future role of these mammals in disease development. In particular, increased efforts are needed to explore the differences of replication, genetic, and pathogenic features between the classical rabies virus and other lyssaviruses, especially since there has been a recent report of rapid mutation of the rabies virus in wild animals in the USA [30] .",
