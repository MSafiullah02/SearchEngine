Table 2 shows the complications, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of the patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As previously reported in a Chinese study, 2 our patients who required ICU care had many complications, such as multiple organ failure. ARDS (18/98 patients; 18.4%), septic shock (9/98; 9.2%), acute cardiac injury (11/98; 11.2%), and acute kidney injury (9/98; 9.2%) were more frequent in our study than in other Chinese studies. [1] [2] [3] 12 It is estimated that the severity of disease in the COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study was higher than that of the patients in Chinese studies. The greater disease severity may account for higher rates of use of invasive mechanical ventilation (11.2%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (4.1%), and continuous renal replacement therapy (3.1%) than reported in the aforementioned Chinese studies.",

In our study, 18.4% of all patients received systemic glucocorticoids, and 76.9% of patients in the ICU received systemic glucocorticoids. Because \"severity\" was not clearly defined in the Chinese study, it is difficult to compare findings. However, the high rate of use of glucocorticoids in our study can be ex-plained by the fact that 84% of our ICU patients received invasive mechanical ventilation versus just 35.7% of the severe COVID-19 patients in the Chinese study. Wu, et al. 13 reported that treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed ARDS.
