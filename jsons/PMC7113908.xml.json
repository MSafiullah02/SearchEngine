            "text": "Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is a large enveloped RNA virus that is classified within a species Betacoronavirus 1 in the family Coronaviridae (Erles et al.\n2003). The virus was first isolated from dogs with respiratory disease in a rehoming shelter in the United Kingdom (Erles et al.\n2003). On the day of admission to that shelter 30% of dogs were seropositive, and nearly all seronegative dogs seroconverted to CRCoV after a 3-week stay at the shelter, indicating high transmissibility of the virus. The presence of CRCoV antibody on entry to the shelter was associated with decreased risk of development of respiratory disease, suggesting an aetiological involvement of the virus in infectious canine tracheobronchitis (ICT). Results of several further studies in the United Kingdom and other countries also suggested that CRCoV contributes to development of respiratory disease in infected dogs (Erles and Brownlie 2005; Ellis et al.\n2005; Kaneshima et al.\n2006). However affected dogs were often co-infected with several respiratory pathogens, and not all dogs with serological evidence of recent CRCoV infection developed respiratory disease, making the establishment of an aetiological link between CRCoV infection and disease challenging (Erles et al.\n2003; Erles and Brownlie 2005). This is similar to the situation observed for other respiratory pathogens of dogs, underscoring the fact that the aetiology of ICT is complex and factors other than exposure to a specific pathogen are likely to contribute to the outcome of infection (Erles and Brownlie 2008; Mitchell et al.\n2017).",

Antibodies raised to CRCoV are not cross-reactive with CECoV (Decaro et al.\n2007; Priestnall et al.\n2007). Similarly, vaccines against CECoV do not elicit protection against CRCoV infection (Erles and Brownlie 2008). A high percentage identity was found between the amino acid sequence of the spike protein of BCoV and CRCoV (Erles et al.\n2003), enabling the use of BCoV antigens for the detection of CRCoV antibody (Priestnall et al.\n2006; Decaro et al.\n2007; Soma et al.\n2008).",

Some of the dogs affected by ICT seroconverted to CRCoV between acute and convalescent sampling, suggesting that CRCoV infection was associated with the development of disease in those dogs. However there was a poor match between diseased and healthy dogs in terms of age, breed, and use, so no conclusions could be made regarding aetiological involvement of CRCoV in development of ICT (Sowman et al.\n2018).",

Samples having incomplete information and duplicate sera having the same label numbers were excluded.

Four were from dogs with respiratory disease and 13 from healthy dogs. Dogs were categorised as healthy or sick based on the information provided on the submission form. Healthy dogs included those presented for procedures such as pre-anaesthetic work-up or pre-mating progesterone concentrations, while sick dogs included those presented for a variety of infectious or non-infectious diseases. The serum samples were also categorised into those that came from dogs for which no abnormal respiratory signs were listed on the submission form, and those for which at least one of the clinical signs commonly associated with respiratory disease (coughing, sneezing, or nasal discharge) was listed.

This was higher than the 29% reported previously in New Zealand (Knesl et al.\n2009). Both studies used sera submitted to the same diagnostic laboratory as the source of diagnostic material. However in the 2009 study 251 samples were tested in comparison to 1,015 in the current study. Hence, the current estimation of CRCoV seroprevalence may be more accurate than the previous one. The population sampled in the 2009 study was somewhat loosely defined as representing a wide geographic area encompassing the central and lower North Island of New Zealand. Although samples in the current study originated from a wider geographical area, including the South Island, the majority of samples were from the central and lower North Island, so of similar distribution to the previous study. The difference in seroprevalence is also unlikely to be attributed to differences in the serological tests used, as the sensitivity and specificity of BCoV-based competitive ELISA for detection of CRCoV antibody was reported to be 94.4% and 96.7%, respectively, when compared to a fluorescent antibody test with CRCoV antigen that was used in the previous study (Priestnall et al.\n2006).",

This may also be supported by the fact that 50% of dogs tested as part of another New Zealand-based survey were seropositive for CRCoV (Sowman et al.\n2018). The number of samples tested in that study was only 93, but, as in the current study, the samples were collected over a period of several months from July 2012 to August 2013. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that the seroprevalence of CRCoV has increased in New Zealand since 2009.",

Similar to our results, other studies found regional differences in CRCoV seroprevalence, as can be exemplified by differences between various regions in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom. It has been suggested that the CRCoV seroprevalence may be higher in areas with a higher density of humans, and therefore presumably canine, populations (Priestnall et al.\n2006). However CRCoV seroprevalence was similar in some of the less densely populated regions of the South Island and the more densely populated region of Auckland. On the other hand, regional differences were apparent, as seroprevalence in dogs from Auckland was higher in comparison to dogs from the Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Marlborough, and Waikato regions. One possible reason for these differences is sample size and associated selection bias. In addition, population density in most parts of New Zealand, possibly with the exception of Auckland, is not uniform. Hence it may have been of interest to stratify the samples by the size of town/city, in addition to the geographical region. This was not performed as we did not have access to addresses of the submitters beyond the region classification. Overall, our data suggest that the epidemiology of CRCoV in New Zealand is similar to that observed overseas, particularly in Europe and in the United States of America.",

The lowest CRCoV seroprevalences (22% and 17%) were detected in the winter months of July and August, but the highest seroprevalence (74%) was also observed in winter (June). This suggests that temporal differences in CRCoV seroprevalence were more likely to be related to factors other than external temperatures. These could include the increased contact between infected and non-infected dogs through activities such as training, competitions, short- or long-term kennelling or travel, but the exact nature of such interactions and their influence on the spread of CRCoV remain to be elucidated.",

This is most easily explained by the increased likelihood of exposure to the virus for older dogs, which had more opportunities for contact with infectious dogs or contaminated environments than younger dogs. However we did not see a relative decline in the percentage of seropositive dogs among those older than 10 years, as reported by Priestnall et al. (2006, 2007). Those authors suggested that this could be related to the age-related fall in the efficiency of the immune response. In the current study, mean POI was lowest in seropositive dogs >10 years of age, which may support this conclusion. As it is currently unknown how long CRCoV antibodies persist in dogs, the lower POI detected in older dogs may also represent residual antibody due to past exposure as opposed to recent infection.",

In addition, some dogs categorised as having abnormal respiratory signs may have been included due to non-infectious causes, as the group allocation was made based on limited clinical data provided on the submission form. Finally, the retrospective nature of the study, combined with the samples being sourced from a diagnostic laboratory, was likely to introduce a selection bias towards dogs with a variety of health problems compared with the general population.

None-the-less, there appeared to be no difference in seroprevalence of CRCoV among dogs from different use categories, which was consistent with results of An et al. (2010) who reported no difference in CRCoV seroprevalence between farm dogs and pet dogs. Also consistent with overseas findings (Erles and Brownlie 2005; Soma et al.\n2008) was the lack of association between the sex of the dog and seroprevalence of CRCoV, indicating that sex-related activities or behaviours are unlikely to be associated with the likelihood of exposure to the virus.",
