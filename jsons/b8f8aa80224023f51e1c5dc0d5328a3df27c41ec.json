In Italy the majority of severe cases and deaths occurred in the Po Valley, accounting for three quarters of the entire Italian caseload, pointing to a specific characteristic of the territory that may favour spread and severity of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The worst COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported in the Po valley, in the cities of Lodi, Cremona, Bergamo and Brescia which are known to be the four Italian cities with highest pollution levels [6] .

ACE-2 has been shown to be a co-receptor for viral entry of SARS-CoV-2, through interaction with viral spike proteins (VPS) [13] . ACE-2 is expressed mainly at alveolar level, explaining the viral tropism for lower airways. Binding and entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells is facilitated by the interaction between receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit on viral spike glycoproteins with the ectodomain of ACE-2 [14] . SARS-CoV infection and challenge with recombinant SARS-Spike protein trigger a marked downregulation of ACE-2 expression in lungs and in cell culture causing more severe acute lung injury [15] .

Inhalation of the same concentration of NO2 without viral exposure did not result in tissue damage. Reinoculation of the virus after 30 days produced re-infection only in previously exposed mice. These observations suggest a putative role of NO2 in worsening pulmonary damage in COVID-19 patients. Recent exposure to moderately high levels of nitric dioxide may have caused a worsening of the disease with exacerbation of the symptoms and of the respiratory distress. This would cause an overlap between the COVID-19 presentation and NO2-induced alveolar damage. \"Double-hit\" hypothesis The recent outbreak of COVID-19 is straining healthcare systems due to the high infectiousness and large number of patients with severe pneumonia requiring ICU treatment. Some geographical locations, such as the province of Hubei in China and Po Valley in Italy, have suffered the highest number of cases and deaths. This geographical distribution of the outbreaks shows a remarkable overlap with the local levels of air pollution.",

A more detailed epidemiological analysis is necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in severity of SARS-CoV-2 in different areas. Likewise, our observations are limited as detailed geographic measurements of pollutants, such as NO2 in the last few months have not yet been published. Nevertheless, we find the available evidence showing a direct link between atmospheric pollution and SARS-CoV-2 linked by ACE-2 receptor expression compelling. ACE-2 receptor expression can be obtained from swabs and if linked to alveolar expression from ex-vivo tissue samples may provide a method for testing this hypothesis.ConclusionsA link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and air pollution is plausible and this may have a strong impact on the high rate of infection and mortality. If confirmed, our hypothesis has both immediate and long-term implications. In the short term it may help in identifying areas where serious cases are most likely to occur allowing timely allocation of limited and precious resources. It may also have prophylactic and treatment implications in the modulation of ACE-2 receptors before and after infection. In the medium and long-term our hypothesis should lead to an increased awareness that in specific environments defined by high density of population and high industrialization, together with certain climatic characteristics, influencing urban planning to bring about changes such as delocalization of factories, in order to avoid recreating the conditions associated with worse outcomes after viral infections. Weather forecasting and seasonal prediction systems may also contribute in fighting the virus spread.",
