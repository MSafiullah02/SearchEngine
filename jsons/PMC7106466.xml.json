            "text": "Case reports and case series suggest that combined treatments including ribavirin may be beneficial to some extent; however, in all of these studies, the effect of ribavirin is confounded by the concomitant use of other agents. For example, studies describe clinical and radiological improvements in patients treated with ribavirin and steroids,29, 30 but, without a control group, it is difficult to determine whether the improvements result from ribavirin, steroids, the combination of both, or the natural course of the illness. One study showed that the delayed initiation of combined therapy with ribavirin and steroids was among the risk factors associated with severe complicated disease, suggesting that ribavirin might be beneficial, but it is difficult to delineate the role of delaying the use of ribavirin from the delay in the use of steroids.31 The results of a randomised clinical study in Guangdong, involving multiple different treatment arms, suggest that ribavirin given at a low dose (400\u2013600 mg/day) was less effective compared with an early and aggressive use of steroids with interferon alfa.32 However, the lack of a control arm in this study does not allow for one to make definitive conclusions about whether or not ribavirin has any positive effect on SARS compared with no treatment. In-vitro testing showed that ribavirin was not able to inhibit SARS-coronavirus replication at clinically achievable concentrations.33, 34 This finding, combined with post-mortem findings demonstrating high viral loads in most patients despite treatment with ribavirin,35 suggests that if ribavirin has any effect against SARS coronavirus, it is likely to have only a small beneficial effect at best. This is important when the side-effects that have been associated with ribavirin use are considered. Knowles and co-workers reported common adverse events in 110 people with suspected or probable SARS who were treated with ribavirin.36 61% of these people had evidence of haemolytic anaemia; hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia were reported in 58% and 46% of the people, respectively.",

The lopinavir/ritonavir combination was first considered a potentially useful treatment after in-vitro studies showed it had antiviral activity against SARS coronavirus.37, 38 Chan and colleagues38 compared outcomes in people who received lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment, and as rescue therapy, with matched controls; all patients were given ribavirin and steroids according to a standardised protocol. The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate compared with matched controls (p<0\u00b705). However, the subgroup that received lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy did not show a significant difference in these endpoints. Chu and co-workers37 also assessed treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir compared with historic controls; all patients were also treated with ribavirin and steroids in a similar protocol to that of Chan and collegues. Adverse events (development of acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] or death within 21 days) were significantly lower in the lopinavir/ritonavir group than in the historic controls (p<0\u00b7001). In addition, a significant reduction in the need for rescue pulsed steroids for severe respiratory deterioration (p<0\u00b7001) and significantly lower nosocomial infections were also noted in those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, compared with controls (p<0\u00b7043). By multivariate analysis, it was demonstrated that the lack of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, age 60 years old or greater, and positive hepatitis B carrier status were independent predictors of an adverse outcome including death or the development of ARDS requiring intensive care within 21 days of onset of illness.37 Based on these studies, lopinavir/ritonavir appears to be a promising anti-SARS-coronavirus agent.",

Ho and co-workers66 retrospectively compared the clinical and radiographic outcomes of people with probable SARS who received ribavirin, 17 of whom initially received pulsed, high-dose steroids and 55 of whom initially received low-dose steroids. Pulsed, high-dose steroids were also given to any patient as rescue therapy in the presence of deteriorating respiratory status. The cumulative steroid dose, intensive care unit admission rate, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality rates were similar in both groups after 21 days. However, those people initially given pulsed steroids required less oxygen and had earlier radiographic improvement. In addition, they required substantially less rescue pulsed steroids. This study suggests that early initiation of pulsed steroids may have a role in the treatment of SARS. However, definitive studies are needed and the potential benefits of steroids must be compared with the associated risks, such as the development of avascular necrosis, secondary sepsis, and fatal aspergillosis, some of which have been described in people with SARS.67, 68 In Beijing, Hong and Du69 evaluated 67 people with SARS who had received steroids and ribavirin, and who presented with large-joint pain, potentially caused by avascular necrosis, between March and May 2003. Both plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging examination were completed on the same day. 28 people were identified with avascular necrosis. The mean time to diagnosis of avascular necrosis was 119 days after the onset of SARS, or 116 days after steroid use.",

This passive immunisation was attempted with anecdotal success.76 Since then, prior infection and passive transfer of murine neutralising antibodies have been shown to prevent replication of SARS coronavirus in the respiratory tract in mice.77 Technological advances enabling the development and purification of human monoclonal antibodies can be exploited to create specific monoclonal antibodies in large-scale production. Indeed, monoclonal antibodies obtained from immortalised B lymphocytes isolated during convalescence from people with SARS have been shown to neutralise virus infection in vitro and to prevent virus replication in a mouse model of SARS-coronavirus infection.78 In addition, ter Meulen and colleagues79 showed that prophylactic administration of a human IgG monoclonal antibody reactive with whole inactivated SARS coronavirus was able to reduce replication of SARS coronavirus in the lungs of infected ferrets, completely prevent the development of SARS-coronavirus-induced macroscopic lung pathology, and stop the shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions.",

All monkeys were challenged with SARS coronavirus 28 days after immunisation. Neutralising serum antibodies were noted in all of the vaccinated animals.
