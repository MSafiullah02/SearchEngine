Investments in agriculture, such as the use of hybrids, agroforestry systems, or fertilizers, have been effective in reducing poverty in developing countries (Sachs 2005), notably in Africa, where a 10% increase in agricultural yield reduced the percentage of people living on $1 per day by 9% (Irz et al. 2001). Applying ecological knowledge to the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, species interactions, soil fertility, pollination, and pest and disease control can greatly increase productivity in poor areas, while conserving the resource base upon which agriculture depends.",

Islands of red clover have 19\u201360% fewer cases of herbivore parasitism compared to non\u2010isolated communities, indicating that lack of habitat connectivity releases insects from predator control (Kruess and Tscharntke 2002). Semi\u2010natural habitats adjacent to agricultural zones enjoy lower disturbance levels and therefore support larger predator and parasite populations (Thies and Tscharntke 1999). However, maintenance of semi\u2010natural landscapes must be based on an understanding of the ecology of beneficial species. For example, a study of bumblebee densities showed that densities were positively correlated to availability of mass flowering crops rather than to the proportion of semi\u2010natural habitats in landscapes (Westphal et al. 2003). Future research needs to be focused on how landscape configuration, complexity, and quality of semi\u2010natural habitat affect agricultural productivity.",

Similarly, irrigation projects, population migrations, increased livestock production, and introduction of invasive species have been tied to outbreaks of malaria, Nipah virus, and schistosomiasis in the developing world (Patz et al. 2004). Through the spatial integration of biogeochemical data, remotely sensed vegetation classes, and mosquito abundance data, Pope et al. (2005) linked phosphorous runoff from agricultural fields in Belize to increased abundance of cattails (Typha domingensis) in adjacent marshes. The increase in cattails may have heightened malaria risk by creating mosquito habitat close to areas of human residency.

This \u201cmixed\u2010portfolio\u201d approach to agroforestry exploits the functional traits of complementary species, such as sprouting ability, nitrogen fixation, and timing of fruit production to maximize the services provided by woodlots. Benefits include fuelwood production (using the stems of coppiced trees) close to households, improved food security and nutrition, the potential for income generation and diversification through the production of goods for sale, increased soil fertility (more soil nitrogen using the leafy material from coppiced trees and from planting nitrogen\u2010fixing species), decreased soil erosion (through the presence of tree roots and soil cover), watershed protection, biological carbon sequestration, preservation of species and genetic diversity, greater landscape diversity, and decreased pressure on surrounding forests (Leakey 2001).

However, empirical studies of large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs) are rare because of the unpredictable nature of these events (Turner and Dale 1998). As a result, LIDs are rarely addressed in management plans, even though the severity of their impacts can occasionally be mitigated by management. Most of the discussion of LID management is in the context of sparsely populated areas; as a result, there is a paucity of knowledge on how LIDs affect human\u2010dominated ecosystems. To fill these knowledge gaps, ecologists should be included in disaster assessment teams in order to document the ecological impact of LIDs on human\u2013environment interactions.",

            "text": "Social scientists have long recognized that poverty is a complex phenomenon, involving components such as income, health, education, and vulnerability, all interacting across spatial and temporal scales (Agrawal and Redford 2006). Similarly, ecologists work in multidimensional systems, composed of organisms, energy, and the physical environment interacting at various spatial and temporal scales, which can be described in terms of composition, structure, functions, fluxes, resilience, or other dynamics (Pickett and Cadenasso 2002). Successful implementation of environmental interventions to reduce poverty will require recognition of the complexities inherent in issues of poverty and the environment and the existence of trade\u2010offs, synergies, and interactions operating among the different components. Historically, most development interventions have not been multisectoral in scope. Infrastructure development and macroeconomic reforms such as market liberalization usually addressed only certain aspects of poverty and often had major, unintended effects on other development goals. For instance, efforts to boost agricultural productivity through irrigation canal construction unintentionally increased malaria incidence by increasing the amount of standing water present (Patz et al. 2004). More recent development initiatives, particularly the UK's Sustainable Livelihoods program, are more multisectoral and strive to maximize the benefits of multiple poverty reducing interventions by recognizing trade\u2010offs where they exist while minimizing unintended adverse effects. This approach has also been adopted by the Millennium Villages Project, in which 12 village clusters in each of Africa's agroecological zones will be the site of simultaneous and integrated investments in agriculture, health, education, environment, and infrastructure, to end extreme poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (Sachs 2005). These village\u2010level interventions are science\u2010based, shaped by local community input, and are rigorously monitored to assess the progress, cost, and efficacy of interventions. This approach differs from many other development projects by simultaneously addressing the multiple facets of poverty through the joint work of community leaders and multi\u2010disciplinary teams of specialists.",

This permits hypothesis testing, adaptive learning, and the reformulation of development projects if needed. Rigorous development experiments with appropriate controls, measurable outcomes, long\u2010term monitoring, and the use of statistical tools should include the input of ecologists and other researchers. This scientific approach would provide a more detailed understanding of the effects of development interventions, highlight important contextual factors, determine the long\u2010term sustainability of such initiatives, and facilitate the scaling\u2010up of effective interventions (Agrawal and Redford 2006).",
