[3] [4] [5] It has been believed that the majority of exacerbations are associated with bacterial infection; however, as many episodes occur without any increase in the volume or purulence of sputum, it is also postulated that bacteria may be secondary invaders following a primary viral infection. 6 Recent studies demonstrating the presence of a virus vary widely in terms of the population studied as well as the technology used to detect the virus. Most studies have been conducted in Europe and the USA, and scant data are available from other parts of the world. Different techniques, such as serology, viral culture, PCR and RT-PCR have been used to detect viruses. Currently, PCR and RT-PCR are being widely used due to their better capacity for detection compared with conventional viral culture and serology. 7 Prevalence and incidence studies are important for both health-care planning and epidemiological research as they estimate the burden of a condition within a population. The prevalence and geographical distribution of respiratory viruses in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) has not yet been clearly defined. This knowledge may assist in the management of these patients. The present study calculated the weighted mean prevalence (WMP) of respiratory viruses in AECOPD from prospective studies that utilized the most sensitive techniques (PCR and RT-PCR) to identify the presence of viruses.",

Recent studies have detected viruses in up to 56% of all exacerbations. 12 The use of RT-PCR techniques has increased the detection of respiratory viruses by 2-3 times that of the conventional/rapid viral culture methods. 10, 11, 16 However, the geographical distribution and clinical significance of these viral infections has not been systematically reviewed. We found that the WMP of respiratory viruses in AECOPD was 34.1% (95% CI: 23.9-44.4). There was wide 9 Camargo 15 Rohde 12 Hutchinson 13 McManus 11 Seemungal 16 Papi 17 geographical variation in the total viral prevalence as well as the type of viruses. Overall, picornavirus was the most commonly detected virus followed by influenza and RSV. Studies from Western countries have shown picornavirus to be the most common virus associated with AECOPD, whereas the single Asian study detected influenza most frequently. This disparity in prevalence of influenza in acute exacerbation could be related simply to the strain circulating at that particular year and time, or could reflect the wider coverage of influenza vaccination in Western countries compared with Asian. In an older cohort of patients with chronic lung disease in the USA, studied by Nichol et al., 18 patients who were not vaccinated for influenza had twice the hospitalization rate in the influenza season than in the non-influenza season. 20 In addition, influenza vaccination was associated with a lower risk of death. It was further observed in a systematic review by Poole and colleagues that vaccination of COPD patients resulted in a significant reduction in the total number of exacerbations per vaccinated subject compared with those who received placebo (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 0.37). 21 Human metapneumovirus was discovered in 2001 and initially detected in young children with respiratory illness. 12 However, in two subsequent studies, hMPV was detected in 2.3% and 4.69% of patients with AECOPD, respectively, thereby confirming the presence of hMPV in adults. 14, 22 Rohde and colleagues detected a high hMPV load in their patients, more so in nasal washings than in induced sputum, and postulated that hMPV may be a trigger for exacerbation in COPD. 22",

            "text": "Cohorts with higher vaccine coverage for influenza have been found to have a lower prevalence of influenza. 10, 13 Beckham et al. 9 found that the subgroup of their studied population with low influenza vaccine coverage in the previous year had higher influenza infections and detection. Moreover, none of the influenza-positive patients in their group received vaccination in the previous year. On the other hand, Ko et al. 11 did not observe any beneficial effect of influenza vaccination on the prevalence of virus infections. Nevertheless, inadequate use of influenza vaccine remains an important modifiable risk factor in patients hospitalized with COPD. 20 In summary, this study supports the hypothesis that a significant proportion of patients with AECOPD have associated respiratory viral infections. Overall, picornavirus has been the most common viral infection detected, followed by influenza and RSV. There is a significant geographical variation in viral epidemiology, the reasons for which may be multifactorial. The association between viral infections and mortality and morbidity as well as the level of immunization may have important therapeutic implications for the future management of AECOPD.",
