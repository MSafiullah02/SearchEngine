            "text": "It was December 31st, 2019 when Chinese Health officials informed the World Health Organization (WHO) about the cluster of a mysterious pneumonia in 41 patients in the city of Wuhan and in the Chinese province of Hubei. 1 One week later a new coronavirus, currently known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the etiologic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, and soon after the first death was recorded. 2 Since then, the infection has rapidly spread worldwide due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2, despite sharing an 80% of sequence homology with the virus responsible of 2003 SARS epidemic, 3 has a highly increased contagiousness. 4 On March 11th, 2020 the WHO declared COron-aVIrus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) a global pandemic, for the second time in the 21st century after the influenza pandemic caused by H1N1. 5 Currently, a massive viral spread is hitting 205 countries, more than 1,0 0 0,0 0 0 people are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 58,0 0 0 have died. On April 3rd, Italy is the second country, after the United States of America, with the largest outbreak (more than 110,0 0 0 cases and 14,0 0 0 deaths). 7 During the month of March, the emergency decrees and regulations of the Government, Regions and City councils have de facto quarantined the country, urging citizens to home self-isolation, in order to drastically reduce the source of contagion. The government's regulations have had the difficult task of striking a balance between health needs (the necessity of preventing contagion through social isolation) and economic issues, resulting from the lockdown of factories, businesses and other commercial activities. 8 These drastic measures have been necessary, since it has not been possible, so far, a mass screening test to identify the infected people.",

Saliva was collected through the drooling technique or with a pipette, depending on the patient's clinical condition; thus, sputum and oropharyngeal secretions were excluded from the collection. The samples were analysed by rRT-PCR, which showed positive results for all the 25 subjects, with variable threshold cycles (Ct), but always under 33 cycles (range 18.12-32.23, mean 27.16 + / \u2212 3.07). These results reinforce the hypothesis that saliva is a reliable tool to be used in qualitative COVID-19 diagnosis through the rRT-PCR procedure.",
