BPD, as defined by the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks\u2019 postmenstrual age [1\u20133], is the most frequent pulmonary morbidity among survivors of prematurity\u2014a chronic lung condition that affects more than 10,000 premature infants in the United States alone each year [4, 5]. Before the surfactant era, BPD was primarily a structural injury of the preterm lung characterized by decreased alveolarization and surface area, alternating atelectasis with hyperinflation, pulmonary lesions, and fibrosis [6]. Today, BPD represents a developmental arrest of the preterm lung with interruption of the pulmonary septation, alveolarization, and vascularization during the saccular and alveolar stages of lung development [7].The result is a lung with fewer, larger alveoli and a corresponding decrease in surface area available for gas exchange.",

Any or all of these factors, possibly in concert with genetic predisposition or epigenetic factors, could contribute to its occurrence, even though recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) failed to identify any specific loci associated with moderate to severe BPD [8, 9]. Clearly, the pathophysiology of BPD is complex and likely multifactorial, but a central role for pulmonary inflammation seems critical to its development.",

These can act directly on fetal lung cells, including the Type II alveolar cells that produce surfactant [27, 28]. In rabbits, Bry et al. [29] demonstrated that IL-1\u03b1 enhanced messenger RNA transcription of both surfactant proteins and lipids resulted in improved lung compliance [12, 29].

Bacterial antigens such as lipopolysaccharide can cause altered distribution of elastin, the mesenchymal structural protein responsible for proper septation of the lung [12, 34, 35]. Intra-amniotic inflammation also can cause dysregulation of critical growth factors necessary for lung development. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10 expression is inhibited by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), the major proinflammatory signaling pathway stimulated by IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 [36, 37]. FGF-10 plays a key role in lung branching morphogenesis, remodeling, repair, and regeneration [12, 38]. Inhibition or dysregulation of these key functions as a consequence of histological chorioamnionitis or inflammation has resulted in a lung condition in animals that is similar to BPD in humans [35].",

On the other hand, Kramer and Jobe [56] hypothesized that this immunosuppressive fetal response may be an advantageous adaptation to chronic exposure to chorioamnionitis that prevents more serious inflammation-mediated lung injury. Indeed, Kallapur et al. [58] lent weight to this theory when they showed that chronic exposure to intra-amniotic endotoxin did not lead to progressive lung injury and extensive structural abnormalities in fetal sheep, but only to mild, persistent inflammation. However, chorioamnionitis leading to prolonged immune dysfunction may subsequently increase susceptibility to postnatal infections.",

Of these 1104 infected infants, 909 (82 %) had Gram-positive and 195 (18 %) had Gram-negative infections. As compared with no infection, the odds ratio (OR) of mortality/BPD was higher in infants who had Gram-negative (OR, 2.79; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.96\u20133.97) and Gram-positive (OR, 1.44; 95 % CI, 1.21\u20131.71) sepsis. Infants with Gram-negative sepsis were significantly more likely to have been born to mothers with chorioamnionitis than uninfected infants (p = 0.004) or those with Gram-positive infections (p = 0.04).

Intrapartum and postnatal acquisition of CMV, defined as detection of CMV in body fluids at \u226521 days of age, and to a lesser extent congenital infection, can result in pneumonitis and increased likelihood for development of BPD in preterm infants [64, 67].",

Of the 145 infants, 27 (19 %) had postnatal detection of CMV defined as diagnosis at \u226521 days of age; all had birth weight <1250 g and were born at <32 weeks\u2019 gestation. Sixteen (59 %) infants presented with acute respiratory decompensation, and importantly, CMV-infected infants had significantly more exposure to mechanical ventilation (p = 0.03) and a higher incidence of BPD (OR 4.0; 95 % CI, 1.3\u201312.4; p =0.02). The authors suggested that postnatal symptomatic CMV infection, like late-onset bacterial sepsis, may predispose to development of BPD by a combination of direct pathogen effects on the lung, inflammation, and/or increased exposure to mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.",

Transmission of CMV by blood transfusion to preterm infants has been virtually eliminated by the use of CMV antibody-negative donors, freezing red blood cells in glycerol before administration, or leukoreduction. Ingestion of human milk now is the primary means by which preterm infants acquire CMV postnatally [74]. While pasteurization of human milk inactivates CMV, it also may reduce its known cognitive, immunological, and nutritional benefits. Freezing milk at \u221220 \u00b0C decreases CMV viral titers, but does prevent transmission [75, 76].",

Fifty two percent (26/50) of infants tested positive for a respiratory virus at least once during the NICU stay. Of 708 specimens obtained, the following viruses were detected: PIV-3, 13; hMPV, 9; RSV-B, 8; RSV-A, 7; PIV-2, 7; hRV, 7; and influenza B, 4. Of note, 18 samples (28 % of the positive swabs) included more than one virus, similar to studies performed in older infants with bronchiolitis where viral codetection is relatively common. Fourteen infants had sequentially positive specimens for the same virus over 3 to 13 days, suggesting that these were true positive results. Compared to infants who did not have a respiratory viral pathogen detected, virus-positive infants had significantly longer length of stay (70 d vs. 35 d, p = 0.002), need for intubation (65 % vs. 29 %, p = 0.01), duration of intubation (19 vs. 5 d, p = 0.03), duration of oxygen requirement (51 vs. 13 d, p = 0.002), more episodes of desaturation (p < 0.0001), and clinical deterioration episodes (p = 0.0001), and importantly, BPD (46 % vs. 21 %, p = 0.05).",

            "text": "It is likely that respiratory viral infections can exacerbate the underlying lung abnormalities of infants with BPD and result in impairment of lung function through early childhood and possibly adolescence. Longitudinal studies of mice who received supplemental oxygen have found a lifelong increased susceptibility to infection with respiratory viruses, and in particular, influenza A virus, compared to preterm controls exposed only to room air [80\u201382]. Higher oxygen concentrations led to a dose-dependent inflammatory response to influenza A exposure [45, 52, 83], with enhanced recruitment of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, as well as increased alveolar fibrosis, increased monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and greater mortality [80]. O\u2019Reilly et al. [80] demonstrated that alveolar type II cells that are responsible for surfactant production can express viral receptors on their surface, with surfactant protein-deficient mice having decreased viral clearance. Pulmonary outcomes of preterm infants infected with a respiratory virus early in life\u2014and especially with RSV, hRV, PIV, and hMPV\u2014bear striking resemblance to outcomes of very premature infants with BPD [84, 85]. Both BPD and early respiratory infection with RSV have been associated with recurrent wheeze and lung function abnormalities that persist to school age [64, 86]. In addition, viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) may be a marker for preexisting abnormal lung function in neonates [64, 87]. Infants with BPD have substantially more rehospitalizations due to RSV and hRV infection than age-matched controls without BPD [88, 89].",

Infants who received palivizumab had significantly less parent-documented and physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing. Similarly, the Dutch RSV Neonatal Network conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of palivizumab prophylaxis in 429 otherwise healthy preterm infants of 33 to 35 weeks\u2019 gestation and demonstrated that palivizumab prophylaxis significantly reduced wheezing days during the first year of age [98]. These studies continue to implicate RSV infection as an important mechanism of recurrent wheeze during the first year of life in preterm infants.",

They noted decreased Lactobacillus spp\n. in endotracheal aspirates of preterm infants who developed BPD and infants born to mothers with chorioamnionitis.

Its impact on human health has received less attention than that of the bacterial microbiome, even though it is likely to be equally important in homeostasis and disease. The potential importance of the human virome in the development of BPD is not known, and our current lack of understanding of its ontogeny in preterm infants constitutes a major knowledge gap in our continuing efforts to decrease the incidence of BPD and its consequences.",
