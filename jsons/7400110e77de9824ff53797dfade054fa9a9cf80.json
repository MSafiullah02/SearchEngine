Sixteen patients were classified into the severe group and admitted to the special ICU ward, and 59 patients were classified into the mild/moderate group and admitted to the normal isolation ward. Most patients were reported with bilateral pneumonia proved by chest CT, and 84% positive findings of CT were characterized as multiple mottling and ground-grass opacity. Figure 1 showed the representative pulmonary CT of two COVID-19 patients.",

In our study, 16 patients (21.3%) were classified as severe cases and admitted to ICU. Of them, seven received HFNC while four received NIV therapy and no patient died. This is in agreement with early studies that most COVID-19 cases had a mild clinical course and recovered in two weeks with supportive therapy, but the rest 15%-20% cases will Our study aimed to find meaningful COVID-19 biomarkers out of conventional hematological examinations for disease severity classification and early warning of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f progression. We compared the level of inflammatory factors and hematological parameters between two different groups of disease severity (Table 3) , and six candidate indexes (CRP, PCT, lymphocyte, NLR, fibrinogen, and D-dimer) were chosen for ROC test. As seen in Figure 2 , the hematological parameters had a higher Two main limitations must be acknowledged. First, as a retrospective cohort study in a single center, there were only 75 COVID-19 patients included and most of them were exported cases. A multiple-center, prospective research is needed to further clarify the value of D-dimer and NLR in COVID-19. Second, we did not test cytokines like interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) because of a shortage of biosafety labs. However, the benefit of routine cytokines monitor is still of controversy. We believed that ideal biomarkers for COVID-19 should be easily accessible, inexpensive and correct. Tests or techniques that incur unnecessary exposure need careful consideration of risk and benefit.",

The elevation of the C-reactive protein level was seen in 58.7% of COVID-19 patients. The treatment protocol of COVID-19 in our center consisted of pharmacotherapy and respiratory support modalities. The pharmacotherapy mainly included antivirus medications, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anticoagulation. Antivirus medications included Lopinavir/Ritonavir (46, 61.3%), Arbidol (42, 56%), and other agents such as Ribavirin, Hydroxychloroquine and Oseltamivir were less prescribed.

The early clinical studies mainly focused on COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and part of patients included in studies were during their hospitalization [6, 7,17]. It is essential to conclude the feature of COVID-19 early to fight against it. However, some limitations of these studies also exist. To explore features of COVID-19 patients with complete hospitalization and outside Hubei province, we enrolled adult COVID-19 patients discharged in Suzhou, one city in East China with an 11-million population. During the past twenty years, there had been two coronavirus-caused serious epidemics, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2003) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2014) [18]. The newly identified SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus and shares more than 85% homology with bat SARS-like coronavirus. Furthermore, the receptor-binding gene region structure of SARS-CoV-2 resembles to that of SARS-CoV. After isolated and cultured in vitro, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in human respiratory epithelial cells in 96 hours.SARS-CoV-2 can bind the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion as SARS-CoV[3].",

It is crucial to discriminate severe COVID-19 cases because early intervention can make a different outcome.A recent finding from three COVID-19 patients by minimally invasive autopsies revealed valuable pathological characteristics[20]. Besides severe lung lesions, the prominent derangement of the lymphohematopoietic system was noted. Decreased lymphocytes, cell degeneration, and necrosis were observed in spleen, and scarcity of lymphocytes and focal necrosis were observed in lymph nodes. CD4 + and CD8 + immunohistochemistry confirmed decreased T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes.Impaired myelopoiesis was also proved in the bone marrow. Another important study reported that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be readily detected in blood stream of 10.5% COVID-19 patients, and there was a strong correlation of serum viral RNA load in blood with the disease severity [21]. The systematic inflammatory response, especially cytokine release syndrome which happened in some COVID-19 patients, usually involved various degrees of blood cell component abnormalities and coagulation factor activation. Huang et al. found an elevated level of NLR in community-acquired pneumonia which correlated with disease severity [22]. Serum D-dimer level was found to have a prognostic value in community-acquired pneumonia and 2009 novel influenza A(H1N1) [16, 23].",
