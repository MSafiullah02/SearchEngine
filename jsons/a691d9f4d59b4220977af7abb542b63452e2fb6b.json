This paper described the elementary requirement and the essential technology for public health information visualization and proposed a framework of the unified public health information visualization platform based on the Web GIS and visualization technology. The system framework adopted multi-tier system infrastructure that consist the sever tier and the front tier. In the server tier, the J2EE based architecture was adopted to construct a distrusted system infrastructure. In the front tier, the GIS map java applet is used to show the public health information with spatial graphical map, and the web based graphics figures such as curves, bars, maps and multi-dimensional visualization technology are used to visualize the public health information. The public health information contained the geo-referenced data, such as specific location, area code, latitude and longitude, street address, and geopolitical boundaries can be visualized with GIS distribution maps. The system infrastructure, functions, system integration, and some key technology were discussed in this paper. It would have the important practical value for constructing the visible public health information system.",

With the development of Internet, the Web GIS becomes a desirable technology for building the public heath information system to prevent against the infectious disease and public health crisis. It is an essential tool for sharing the infectious diseases information, rescuing the infectious patients, isolating virus source area, and sending out the alarm to the public in short time [1] [2] [3] .",

As early as in 1854, Dr. John Snow had used a map to track the original area where the cholera disease erupted in London in first time. From that time, map had been used in the infectious disease controlling and preventing, and it becomes an essential tool in protecting the public health environment [4] . The research subjects of applying the GIS to the public health have attracted much interest in recent years, especial after the eruption of SARS in 2003 [5] . The World Health Organization has used the GIS technology to forecast and analyze the spreading tendency of SARS with a GIS. ESRI Corporation has developed a WEB-GIS based information system to issuing the SARS distribution map in China and Hong Kong area. The SARS infected regions were shown with the visual technology in the map to report the SARS cases and distributed information to public. SarsNet, WHO and the Freach IN-SERM 444 research institute have developed an infectious disease supervisory system, which can be used to search the newest SARS surveillance statistical information from different nations and different time periods. The system has also provided the functions of searching the special disease information according to the geographical position and expressing the results with the visual technology. SarsNet also proposed SARS dissemination models, which can dynamically produce a new SARS distribution map to express developing information of SARS disease in next time [5, 6, 7, 8] .",

The special GIS data format transform software is needs to translate the GIS data format (for example ARC/INFO, ArcView, MapInfo, ERDAS, and Atlas and so on). The system lacks the exchange standing for information and data and the resources cannot be shared by other system. (2) The spatial data is usually huge (several hundred MB to several GB). The user must have enough storage and the bandwidth to transmission data. While in very many situations, user possibly only needs a small area of the whole map or the partial GIS data, not the complete spatial data. As a result of the network and the bandwidth limit, the system performance becomes very slow.",
