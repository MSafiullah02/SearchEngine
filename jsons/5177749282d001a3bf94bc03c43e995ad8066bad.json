Here we use laboratory confirmation date data which covered 94 both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. In addition, the R 0 estimates from two 95 countries were largely consistent with those estimates in Wuhan, Hubei, China [7]. If 96 there were evidences suggesting that the exponential growth started earlier, we note 97 that the R 0 estimates would decrease.
