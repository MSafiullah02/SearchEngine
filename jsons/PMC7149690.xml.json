Developments in many fields but especially molecular genetics have facilitated the characterization of genes with multiple alleles that regulate disease resistance.

Other examples of genetic resistance in mice to what were then termed arboviruses were soon to follow. Today, polymorphous genes that regulate resistance to 11 genera of viruses have been reported.",

This came in the 1950s when the highly virulent myxoma virus was introduced into wild European rabbits in Australia to control burgeoning lagomorph populations. Although numerous factors conspired to attenuate initially high mortality rates, selection for resistant host genes was clearly an important factor. In humans, attempts to associate the severity of smallpox, poliomyelitis, congenital rubella and hepatitis B with various blood group and major histocompatibility antigens met with limited success. An impetus for this line of inquiry in humans came with Allison's discovery in 1964 of the relationship between resistance to falciparum malaria and heterozygosity of the sickle cell gene. Although this work did not deal with a viral infection, it established that genetic polymorphisms in humans regulate resistance to at least one microbial disease.",

Derivatives of resistant and susceptible strains such as bilineal congenic and recombinant inbred strains have been especially valuable in these studies. What has emerged from them is confirmation that polymorphous host genes are important regulators of the severity of many if not most viral infections, that single or multiple loci are involved, and that each locus appears to specify resistance to a particular genus of virus, or even a specific strain of virus within a genus. These studies have also shown that polymorphisms within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) may influence the course of viral infections, but that loci outside of the MHC are often more important.",

Beginning with their interaction with host-encoded cell surface receptors and host factors involved in uncoating, continuing with their use of host transcription and translation factors, and ending with host-encoded post-translational enzymes, viruses require multiple products of host genes. The specific viral requirements differ depending on the replication strategy of the virus. In addition, viruses elicit protective responses in the host that are ultimately orchestrated by the host genome and these responses also vary depending on the virus. Any of these multiple points of interaction between the virus and products of the host genome have the potential to be sources of variation if alleles exist at these points within the host population and if the products of these alleles interact differently with the viral genome or its products.",

The effects of the latter cannot usually be demonstrated in pure populations of target cells in culture because they involve cell interactions which are orchestrated at the organismal level. There is at least one exception to this organizational paradigm, however, and that is the antiviral state that is induced in target cells by interferons.

Mice that carry the H-2\nd or H-2\nb haplotypes are 10 times more susceptible to lethal cytomegalovirus infection and permit significantly more virus replication than mice of the same genetic background that carry the H-2\nk haplotype. This difference is determined by the class I gene, H-2D. Products of class I MHC genes are important in cellular immune responses. Class I antigens are expressed by a wide variety of cells and serve as recognition molecules for specific classes of T cells. In the case of cytomegalovirus infection, however, the role of H-2D in genetic resistance is independent of its role in immune recognition. Cells from H-2D\nk mice are highly insensitive to infection with MCMV. Class I heavy-chain antigens are covalently bound to a second cell surface antigen, \u03b2\n2-microglobulin, which is believed to serve as a cytomegalovirus receptor. The H-2D antigen is therefore directly involved with virus binding or it regulates the affinity of \u03b2\n2-microglobulin for the virus antireceptor. In the case of H-2D\nk antigen the affinity of mouse cytomegalovirus for \u03b2\n2-microglobulin is markedly reduced.",

Like H-2D in the MCMV system, its effects are readily seen in infected cells in primary cultures. The mechanism of action of Hv-2 is currently disputed. Only one strain of mouse, SJL, is known to carry the Hv-2\nr allele. Mendelian genetics of resistance to the lethal effects of MHV4 in crosses between SJL and various susceptible strains indicate that one gene controls resistance. It has been shown that SJL mice fail to express a 110 K cell surface glycoprotein that binds MHV4, whereas susceptible strains of mice do. These data suggest that Hv-2 encodes the viral receptor. Hv-2 was defined on the basis of differences in the replication of MHV4 in macrophages from resistant and susceptible mice. In macrophages from Hv-2\nr and Hv-2\ns mice, the virus replication diverges at a point after the virus is internalized and after transcription of viral genes. This suggests that Hv-2 does not encode the virus receptor but a protein that functions subsequent to binding. There is evidence that Hv-2 encodes the host protease that activates the viral S glycoprotein which serves as the antireceptor. This virus\u2013host interaction is necessary for the infection to spread and could explain why the infection fails to spread in macrophage cultures from Hv-2\nr mice.",

All of these examples are believed to regulate specific immune responses that are involved in virus clearance or in immunopathic injury. Four of these genes regulate susceptibility to Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), a picornavirus. Mice that are inoculated intracerebrally with certain laboratory-adapted strains of TMEV may develop one of several diseases, depending on their genotype.\nThe most intensively studied disease occurs after the acute phase of infection and is characterized by progressive paralysis in association with chronic demyelination of the central nervous system. This disease is immunologically mediated and is associated with viral persistence in the white matter oligodendrocytes and infiltrating macrophages. The genes that mediate susceptibility to viral persistence and myelin breakdown in this system vary with the strain of mouse. In susceptible DBA/2 mice, demyelination is mediated by the H-2D\nd allele of the MHC and a second allele at a locus near the Car-2 gene on chromosome 3. In susceptible SJL mice, disease is mediated by an allele on a gene located near the structural gene for the T cell receptor \u03b2-chain constant region on chromosome 6. The H-2D\ns allele of the MHC of SJL mice also appears to mediate susceptibility in SJL mice but its effects have not been seen in all studies.",

The chronic myocarditis results from an auto-immune response to cardiac myosin that is triggered by viral replication in and injury to the heart of susceptible mice. Both H-2-linked and non-H-2-linked genes control susceptibility to chronic myocarditis. One form of the disease is mediated by IgG antibodies specific for cardiac myosin. This form is seen in DBA/2 and A mice and is modulated by a gene that is located on chromosome 14 in the vicinity of structural loci for the T cell receptor \u03b1-chain and the cardiac myosin \u03b1-heavy chain.\nAssociations between the T cell receptor repertoire and autoimmune diseases has been previously mentioned in the context of TMEV-induced chronic demyelination. The possibility that allelic differences in cardiac myosin may account for the observed chromosomal localization of the susceptibility gene is also being considered. However, the susceptible phenotype has been shown to correlate with susceptibility to autoimmune myocarditis after immunization with cardiac myosin, suggesting that allelic differences in cardiac myosin are not the basis of susceptibility.",

Other similarities between these two loci are that they are expressed in the spleen, they regulate virus-induced splenic necrosis, they regulate the influx of cells into the spleen or the proliferation of cells already present, and their resistance alleles are expressed by the same strains of mice.
