After feeding and nipple disinfection, milk was collected with pumps and stored in sterile containers at 4\u00b0C or \u221220\u00b0C until further analysis. We determined viral loads using RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 N and ORF1b-nsp14 genes4 in both whole and skimmed milk (obtained after removal of the lipid fraction). Further details of sample storage and processing are provided in the appendix. Following admission and delivery (day 0), four samples from Mother 1 tested negative (figure 2\n). By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in milk from Mother 2 at days 10 (left and right breast), 12, and 13. Samples taken subsequently were negative (figure 2). Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 N peaked at 29\u00b78 and 30\u00b74 in whole milk and skimmed milk, respectively, corresponding to 1\u00b732 \u00d7 105 copies per mL and 9\u00b748 \u00d7 104 copies per mL (mean of both isolations). Since milk components might affect RNA isolation and quantification, viral RNA recovery rates in milk spiked with serial dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 stock were determined. We observed up to 89\u00b72% reduced recovery rate in whole milk and 51\u00b75% in skimmed milk (appendix), suggesting that the actual viral loads in whole milk of Mother 2 could be even higher than detected.",

Detection of viral RNA in milk from Mother 2 coincided with mild COVID-19 symptoms and a SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic test of the newborn (Newborn 2). Mother 2 had been wearing a surgical mask since the onset of symptoms and followed safety precautions when handling or feeding the neonate (including proper hand and breast disinfection, strict washing, and sterilisation of milk pumps and tubes). However, whether Newborn 2 was infected by breastfeeding or other modes of transmission remains unclear. Further studies of milk samples from lactating women and possible virus transmission via breastfeeding are needed to develop recommendations on whether mothers with COVID-19 should breastfeed.",

Following spatial isolation of Mother 1 with her newborn (Newborn 1), Newborn 1 subsequently tested positive and developed respiratory problems, but both Mother 1 and Newborn 1 recovered. Mother 2 was admitted to the same hospital and room as Mother 1 and Newborn 1. Upon delivery, Mother 2 and Newborn 2 were brought back to the same room as Mother 1 and Newborn 1, and they stayed in the same room until Mother 1 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and isolated. Mother 2 and Newborn 2 were discharged on day 4. Mother 2 developed mild COVID-19 symptoms shortly thereafter and began wearing a surgical mask at all times of the day. Mother 2 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on day 8. 3 days later, Newborn 2 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was readmitted to hospital because of newborn icterus and severe breathing problems. The child received ultraviolet therapy and ventilation therapy. Newborn 2 tested positive for RSV and SARS-CoV-2 at later timepoints. Mother 1 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 again on day 22, 13 days after first being diagnosed. RT-qPCR analysis of breastmilk samples from both mothers revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the milk of Mother 2 on days 10\u201313 (red bottles), whereas samples from Mother 1 were negative (white bottles).
