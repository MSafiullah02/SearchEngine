As many countries are already experiencing shortages of diagnosis kits and factories struggling to keep with the demand [5] [6] [7] , it has become important to come up with new ways to conserve the reagents used for diagnostic tests. At the same time, as the disease is novel, it is of value to validate any modifications to the testing process before universal adoption 8,9 . Pooling diagnostic tests has been applied in other infectious diseases and is especially attractive as it requires no additional training, equipment, or materials. In this method, first suggested by Dorfman in 1943 10 and perfected over the years [11] [12] [13] , samples are mixed and tested at a single pool, and subsequent individual tests are made only if the pool tests positive. In addition to being used in the clinic for infectious disease diagnostics in previous epidemics 14, 15 , pooling has been proven to work for RT-qPCR 16, 17 , a time-consuming step for which the reagents are expected to be in short supply 18 .",

For instance, additional amplification cycles could lower detection limit allowing better detection for pools of more than 32 samples, which based on extrapolation of the data we expect would allow the 64sample pools of positive sample #5 to cross the threshold. In addition, some abnormalities as with duplicate B in positive samples #5 and #2 could have been due to interference from contamination in one or more of the samples. The unusual peaks for positive sample #2 could be due to a changing salt concentration that disturbed the TaqMan probe. Since both these issues could be solved by A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 further diluting the RNA samples with water, it is worthwhile to explore whether diluting samples with different ratios of water could improve the integrity of the signal in pooled results. While we tested samples with a range of different signal strengths, the detection of samples with even lower signals may warrant the use of smaller pools. Alternatively, adding a few additional PCR cycles could be considered as a means to increase detection rate of such low viral load samples. In general, as RT-qPCR kits and protocols vary internationally, use of suggested pooling may require validation for each specific setting.",

Except for a single replicate (POS #2 ), all samples reached the threshold in 32-sample pools. For most samples we observed a linear correlation between when the threshold is reached and the doubling of the pool size. On average, for each dilution by a factor of 2, we observed an increase of 1.24 in Ct, corresponding with the expectation that an RNA sample that is diluted twice as much will ideally require one more cycle to double in amount and reach the same fluorescence (Figure 3). The observed linearity indicates that in most cases there is no RNA interference with the reverse transcriptase or DNA polymerase enzyme. From the average slope of 1.24, the expected Ct following pooling was extrapolated for all positive samples and sensitivity was calculated for different pool sizes and different cycle cutoffs (Supplementary Figure 1). Even for a relatively restrictive cutoff of 40 cycles, pooling would reach sensitivity of 96% for a pool size of 16 samples.Of the ten tested replicates, only duplicate B of sample #2 did not cross the threshold in pools of 32.Moreover, with the exception of this specific duplicate, the fluorescence of all 64-sample pools increased in a sigmoidal manner.
