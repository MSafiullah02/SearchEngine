Yet AFTA actually benefits market efficiency, positive competitiveness in the private sector, and provides more choices for consumers. Regionalism is in fact government action at regional level for the benefit of private sectors and consumers.2 In Southeast Asia, local economic liberalization implemented by influential founding members (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand) is very important as a key-success factor for building a solid regional economic commitment in ASEAN ( Ravenhill 1995).",

Using region as a dummy variable (Europe and Asia), they found that the USA\u2019s FDI flows have been relocated from Europe to Asia because the investment pressures in Europe were tighter than those in Asia. This increased FDI and employment creation in Asia, reduced the cost of production in the USA, but at the same time reduced labor absorption in the USA ( hollowing-out). They also found that population is not significant in attracting FDI inflows.

FDI can be a tool to maintain monopoly profit abroad and market access in emerging markets abroad. This model also assessed the effect of capital and quantity function as well as between capital and cost of production using the Cobb-Douglas production function. This research did not only observe the factors for FDI but also the effect of FDI in terms of capital to the economic quantity and cost of production. It also found that the probability of having monopoly power is higher in domestic markets than in foreign markets. This means that foreign investors have been competing in imperfect competition under asymmetric information with local investors abroad.

They implemented cluster analysis at regional level given that the economic gravity in the region is the country with the largest share of intra-regional trade or regional FDI. It adopted relative number in percentage rather than volume to avoid bias assessment. Their research adopted cross-section analysis and took two different years, 1985 and 1995.

They used binomial logit models and found that investment behavior depends on the rivalry action of a competitor. This is similar to the theory of oligopolistic reaction that strategic behavior of one actor depends on the presence of its competitor. In previous studies, classical economics argues that profit in an oligopolistic market would increase if the firms choose to have cooperative policies. Oligopolistic reaction is also known as follow-the-leader behavior or bandwagon effect in trade. A similar argument to oligopolistic reaction applies to investment decisions. A firm would less likely invest in a country where its rivals are already trading because they would avoid going head-to-head since competition always reduces profit. For that reason, oligopolistic reaction is not a risk-taker strategy. Other arguments suggest that a firm would still invest in markets already controlled by their rivals but only to show that it exists. Remembering that the international market consists of several markets, also known as multimarket competition, then in some markets it most likely that one rival controls the market while in other markets another rival is in control. The first-mover would control the market and the following firm would need to adjust its investments in order to keep common profits high. There are five major players in the tire industry: Japan (Bridgestone which acquired Firestone), USA (Goodyear), Italy (Pirelli), France (Michelin which acquired Uniroyal and Goodrich), and Germany (Continental).

This result requires a perfect-information assumption and found that the current multimarket competition theory challenges classical economic oligopolistic theory because the lack of trust between firms would in the end trap them into a prisoner\u2019s dilemma to compete with each other.",

If negative externality is greater than positive externality the follower of FDI will shift its type of investment from direct investment to licensing.

This is known as the \u201cindirect benefit\u201d from local imitation. This provides incentives to be the FDI leader instead of the follower ( first mover advantage). For the follower, the delay time is not only affected by the local imitation adjusting time but also by the level of competition.

If the saving from variable costs is higher than entry costs then a firm is better off investing in FDI and it would be better to export when the opposite occurs.

Pauly (2003) found that the independent variables that significantly affect FDI are labor wage per hour, interest rate, expenditure on R&D, corporate income tax rate, T-Bill rate, and input cost (Producer Price Index). In general, this research focuses on the relationship between FDI and economic growth yet it explains detailed factors between them. This research database was taken from Canada\u2019s industry-level data. This research found that the role of FDI inflows and outflows had increased in developed countries for 10 years from 1990 to 1999. In 1990, the share of FDI inflows and the outflows of GDP of developed countries were 4.7 percent and 6.4 percent respectively while in 1999, they increased up to 14.5 percent and 19 percent respectively. Hejazi and Pauly in this research described three essential factors that affect FDI flows in host countries: market access, factor endowment differences, and access to natural resources. They found that FDI inflows also generated positive impacts for the host country\u2019s domestic economy. From a market-access aspect, inflows stimulated local intra-firm linkages as foreign investors require local intermediate inputs. This, in turn, stimulated export opportunities for local firms. As from factor endowment, motives to invest were influenced by low-cost production and employment creation in the host country. From a natural resources access standpoint, FDI inflows stimulate utilization of natural resources and can make local firms start caring about their own natural resources. From its general models, this research took several variables that hypothetically affect FDI and Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). The variables are corporate profits, corporate taxes, price indices for intermediate inputs, and price indices for labor input (wages), interest rates, capital stocks, and R&D spending.",

Regarding the principle of the international economies of scale, Japanese investors find that each member state of ASEAN has its own comparative advantage in producing components. Japanese investors allocate their FDI in different countries depending on the countries\u2019 different increasing return to scale in producing each component. Japan played as the home country of FDI and Southeast Asian countries played as host countries of FDI. Both home and host country have benefited from this production network.

The RPN increased the bargaining position of investors in the world while the host country could learn from the home country and join with its international production and trade network. The RPN was the original source of the regionalism that increased trade and investment relationships in Southeast Asia. The success story of RPN is the basic proposition for this study to argue that the ASEAN-PLUS framework is the most suitable way for ASEAN to enhance its trade and investment relationship.

He formulates his analysis using mathematical function as follows: there are n countries in which m countries are member state of regional economic organization while n\u2013m are non-bloc. Each country represents a single firm with n domestic market and n\u20131 export market. The linear demand function is P = A \u2212 X; P is price; A is total output in regional-bloc market that remains constant; X is total demand. The relation between P and X follows a linear demand function.",

The dependent variable is Bilateral FDI flows while traditional independent variables are GDP, Population, and Distance. They introduced new variables which are CPI (Corruption Perception Index) and EFI (Economic Freedom Index). They found that the effects of GDP and Population to Bilateral FDI inflows to host countries are positive while distance is negative (i.e., >3,300 km), which means the classical hypotheses are proven. They found CPI effect to Bilateral FDI inflows to host countries to be positive, which means the more accountable the host country\u2019s government the more attractive the host country is for the external FDI investors. EFI effect to Bilateral FDI inflows is negative, which means the more interdependent the host country, the more attractive it is to external FDI investors.

The multinational companies had FDI outflowing from countries that joined trade agreements if the investment was dominated by local investors who received subsidies or members\u2019 investors with privileges from the discriminative trade policies of trade agreements. This argument is known as FDI diversion since it was adopted from the principle of trade diversion. Though there are many articles that discuss this issue, there are two major theories explaining the relation between intra-regional trade and FDI: (1) The horizontal FDI theory (Markusen 1984; Markusen and Venables 1998), which argues that non-member states will provide FDI in particular member states in a region to avoid trade impediments from being discriminated, and (2) The vertical FDI theory ( Helpman 1984; Helpman and Krugman 1985), which argues that increasing FDI in a discriminative trade region will originate from the member states of the region itself due to the increasing intra-regional trade among them and the knowledge-capital model that combines both the horizontal and vertical FDI ( Markusen and Maskus 2001). Theoretically, horizontal FDI is driven by lower trade cost following the tariff rates decrease that increases market size for non-member states, while vertical FDI is led by lower trade cost following the tariff rates decrease that opens new relations in trade ( trade creation) within skill differences among member states. Meanwhile, the theory of regional economic integration starting with intra-regional trade to the ultimate objective can be seen later. Basic studies are available to support the explanation about intra-regional trade, and a description of them follows.",

Identity is a factor that economists rarely use but in this field this factor needs to be observed in order to understand the complete process of regional economic integration. The Philippines proposed CU for ASEAN economic integration instead of AFTA during the 1986 Manila Summit, but this proposal was rejected by Singapore because it did not want to increase its external tariff due to its unilateral trade liberalization. As is known, CU imposes common external tariffs from member states to non-member states. Indonesia had a greater preference for AFTA rather than CU because of (1) ASEAN\u2019s intra-regional trade was insufficient to become a CU, and (2) the difficulties of arranging harmonization of customs administration. They showed that the most successful example of a CU was the European Common Market of 1957. Another was Zollverein, which was established in 1834 by a large number of sovereign German states ( Salvatore 2004). A Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) is a discriminatory trade policy for non-members that can be divided into RTA (Regional Trade Agreements) based on geographic proximity and BTA (Bilateral Trade Agreement) or BFTA (Bilateral Free Trade Agreement) based on common interests regardless of geographic proximity. RTA can be divided into two forms: FTA which regulates internal tariff among members but does not regulate external tariff between members and non-members and CU which regulates external tariff between members and non-members.",

It was harming ASEAN in two ways: The USA is one of the largest destination markets and Mexico is one of the lead competitors for ASEAN products. AFTA represents a progressive institutional development of ASEAN economic integration with its \u201cinter-governmental\u201d mechanism. There are several progressive CEPT mechanisms such as: Rules of Origin to prevent re-export that is in line with tariff deflection and details on Operational Procedures. AFTA became legal-binding for signatories. She argues ASEAN with its ASEAN Way also adopts \u201csoft-regionalism\u201d for its AFTA by implementing flexibility for exceptions without penalty and executing CEPT based on the lowest common denominator on its internal tariff harmonization. AFTA is considered as non-binding and non-punitive in mitigating potential conflict within members. ASEAN provides room for flexibility for excluding particular products as temporary lists by concerned members. For instance, Malaysia with her national automotive industry. Thailand with her petrochemical industry, Philippines which signed CEPT at a lower tariff level over textiles, and the iron and steel industry, and Indonesia over its strategic national industries.",

Baldwin wrote that APT has at least 6 advantages: (1) it has close cooperation between Japan and China, giving the organization a form of leadership; (2) it has a track record of economic cooperation; (3) it is not seen as a new creature of a single regional power; (4) it is, thus, not seen as a threat to countries outside the framework; (5) it has a natural intra-regional trade that is well managed; and (6) it has an open-type regionalism that is easier for other countries to join. In order to ensure the four pillars and for the APT to work very well in achieving economic efficiency he suggested East Asian and Southeast Asian countries should: (1) mitigate hub-spoke bilateralism problem to avoid small countries in this region entering the \u201cspoke trap\u201d; (2) avoid the noodle-bowl problem; and (3) create an open-regionalism principle.",

Recent global financial crises that turned into an economic crisis in 2008 reminded countries of the importance of enhancing their domestic and regional economic cooperation. Asia was lucky to have avoided this crisis because the crises started in the USA and the EU and its dependency to those markets is relatively low compared to Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. (2) Balancing the other regional economic power. Nowadays, almost no country is excluded from regional economic cooperation. Every country is optimizing the benefits of joining a regional economic organization regardless of the explicit costs because the opportunity cost from being excluded is much higher than the cost of joining. The prisoner\u2019s dilemma has put each country in favor of joining a regional economic cooperation rather than not. (3) Increasing bargaining position of each country globally. Negotiations under the regional umbrella help a country\u2019s voice to be more heard more clearly. The process has to be a two-level game at which each country needs to convince the regional economic organization to recognize its interest as being the region\u2019s interest, and if the regional organization agrees, this position will be represented in the global forum as the region\u2019s voice. (4) Regional economic cooperation is a battle training field before a country enters the global market where it is more difficult and challenging in terms of competition. (5) Cooperation among countries within geographic proximity or cross-border lines is the best way to avoid potential conflict or hard competition among them. From an economic perspective, the regional-level trade agreement can start with the establishment of the FTA. Unfortunately, some countries have started with BFTA or sub-regional agreements which involve several countries.",

These costs consist of both administrative costs (COO certificate) and opportunity costs (substitution incentive to export and import from host countries). It is very common for the host country in ASEAN to provide trade incentives such as low import tariff to stimulate FDI. Foreign investors will enjoy such tariff incentives if they invest in the host country or if they import inputs for manufacturing purposes for both objectives: to export or to fulfill domestic market demand. The benefit of using FTA is simply the difference between its MFN and CEPT tariffs. This research by Hayakawa et al. assumes that the more diversified the origin of a firm\u2019s procurement, the higher their output volumes and exports are the larger the difference in the operating profit between FTA rates and general rates (p. 10). In other words, this indicates that firms with many connections in ASEAN are more willing to utilize AFTA tariff facilities since its potential benefit is high. If cost and opportunity cost of using FTA are higher than its benefit, then the utilization of FTA will decrease. In particular, for AFTA, the utilization rate of export to total export (intra trade) is only around 15\u201320 percent (2003\u20132006) while the ratio of import to total import (intra trade) is only 11\u201316 percent (Hiratsuka et al., p. 2).",

Balassa divided the process into two forms: static and dynamic, where he argues that CU is superior to FTA. Yet CU is a static form of economic regional integration because it neglects the progress of technological change and productivity or TFP. He added that CM opens the important role of TFP to economic integration. This is because CM provides a bigger market than just trade of goods to investment movement from local to regional space. The bigger the market, the freer the flows of goods, capital, and people, then the higher productivity and incentives to compete. He defined CM as a dynamic form of regional integration. At this point Balassa discussed that economies of scale is equal to the size of the market. Joining regional economic integration will increase economies of scale of any country. Regional economic integration opens the opportunities for investment, specialization, technology, and know-how transfer, which in turn will increase the competitiveness of a country. On economic union, Balassa explained that harmonization of national policies into a united regional policy is important. This covers various policies such as monetary, fiscal, social, and counter-cyclical. Harmonization will generate economic efficiency and capacity to adjust any economic gaps among the member states. Balassa argues that a free flow of capital regime must be completed with a fixed exchange rate policy. He also suggested that cooperation among the central banks of member states is sufficient, therefore an economic union does not necessarily need a supra-national authority.",

For example, consider the commitment to a preferential trade arrangement (PTA) in 1977 when its implementation (AFTA) was only signed in 1992. An even longer duration has taken place for the AIPs that was also committed to in 1977 yet its implementation (AICO) is still yet to take place. Therefore, in its sluggish implementation, ASEAN shows a better progress in intra-regional trade than her intra-industry trade. ASEAN has been rather slow in handling its economic issues because its establishment has been more geared towards political issues.",

The common exchange rate requires a common currency which cannot be achieved without a single monetary policy. Given that monetary policies are connected to fiscal policies, then at this stage the region needs a political union (PU) because fiscal policies are the backbone of public policies. The latter is strongly connected to politics because it limits and regulates maximum shares of both fiscal deficits and public debt to GDP. We can note that not all of the EU members joined the Euro zone as there was unwillingness to transfer local political power to the region supranational body. A PU is also known as a Single Monetary Union (SMU), as it is in fact a common monetary system that must be completed with the strong commitment of each country to release its political policies over government budgets or fiscal policies so they can be harmonized under the common monetary policy of the region.

There will no longer be central banks at country level but instead a regional central bank with branches in each member. There will be two arguments about the independence of the central bank. The independent central bank means autonomy from politicians such as house of representatives, parliaments, or government yet central banks are still related with each other through the establishment of a single central bank with different branches in each member state. Once a PU can achieve a common agreement on both monetary and fiscal issues then the single central bank can be established and followed by the ultimate step of an economic regional integration: the single currency (SC). Based on the experience of the EU, once a single currency is achieved the region still needs to manage monetary policy as well as its harmonization with disciplined fiscal policy. Yet these levels (SMU and SC) do not necessarily have to involve all the member states. The EU shows that some member states are members of CM but not members of SMU or SC.

The EU\u2019s history is the best learning material for any region in the world attempting to increase and enhance its regional economic cooperation. Before establishing FTAs in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome, the six original or founding members of the EU (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg) signed the Treaty of Paris in 1951. This treaty combined both the European Payments Union (EPU) and European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The selected year birth of the EU is 1957 because this was the year its first PTA (FTA) was established. Yet the Treaty of Paris is considered as a forerunner institution for the EU. Ten years after EU established its first regional economic commitment, it reached a new agreement called the European Economic Community (EEC). If the Treaty of Rome in 1957 covered commitments on FTA, the EEC covered commitments on CU. At this level the EU achieved regional economic integration in trade and investment relations. It took around 20 years for the EU to achieve the next level known as the European Single Market (ESM). This covers the regional commitment on CM. Since the Bretton Woods agreement on international fixed exchange rate of international currency (US$) collapsed in 1971\u20131973, the EU had started its commitment to financial integration, but in reality it needed 20 years after achieving CM to establish the SMU and SC. However, monetary regional integration has made the EU formulate a new treaty called the Treaty of Maastricht, in 1993, because not all of the members were willing to join to establish the SMU and SC. The EU finally circulated its single currency (the Euro) in 2002.",

The AFMM+3 meeting in 2000 formed a network of bilateral currency swap arrangements to address short-run liquidity difficulties and to complete existing international financial arrangements. There are around US$ 120 billion swap arrangements, all managed by the APT Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) in Singapore. The CMI changed its mechanism from bilateral to multilateral with US$ 120 billion. This multilateral cooperation is expected to become a regional monetary institution, with the objective that in the long run Asia will have her AMF again. The multilateral cooperation is supported by all the member states of APT at which small countries can borrow up to five times of their contribution while big countries such as PRC and Japan were limited up to 50 percent of their contributions. This stimulates big support from small countries. Another interesting point is that the reserve of CMIM still very small compared to the sum of its members\u2019 international reserve (2.5 percent). This means that CMIM can increase its size.

In practice, the ABMI has established a credit guarantee mechanism, enhanced its domestic credit-rating agencies, disseminated bonds\u2019 information at regional and country level, and created new secure debt instruments. These have increased bond market growth and reduced currency mismatch at the APT levels.APT Research Group. This group focuses on the promotion of financial stability in both ASEAN and East Asia.

ASEAN+3 is the most successful and comprehensive financial integration practice in Southeast Asia. All of these fields of financial market management prove that APT does not only handle contagious financial crises through the settlement of currency swap arrangements but also prevented such crises through the implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies. Therefore, the ASEAN-PLUS framework that deals with financial stability and integration has to include issues on fiscal adjustment, inflation targeting, and asset-market bubbles to prevent a potentially contagious regional financial instability.

ASEAN continues to build common bilateral FTAs. The first example is the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Cooperation between ASEAN and China, signed November 4, 2002 in Phnom Penh. China is competing to influence Southeast Asia. To anticipate the power of China in Southeast Asia, the USA formed the Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative (EAI). EAI cooperation is expected to shift the role of APEC ( Kassim 2002). In addition to the USA, ASEAN is currently enlarging its cooperation with other large countries such as India, while at the same time enjoying the benefits of competition among advanced economic countries. AIFTA (ASEAN-India Free Trade Agreement) target was formed in ten years, from 2002 to around 2012. Based on its negotiation preparations, the China-ASEAN cooperation (2001\u20132010) started earlier than the India-ASEAN cooperation. The ADB (2010) shared similar thoughts with the conclusions drawn in this book.Once a region-wide FTA is formed, it may also be easier for Asian Countries to establish a custom union\u2026 as the European Economic Community did in 1968.\n",

The data for 2006 show that Asia\u2019s regional trade depends more on the Asian region itself. As described earlier Asia\u2019s intra export of around 50 percent went to Asia itself as Europe shows a low ratio of inter-regional trade to intra-regional trade. ASEAN has been committed to implementing appropriate monetary and fiscal policy since Southeast Asia faced its financial crises in 1997/1998. Based on the best practice experience of harmonizing monetary and fiscal policy and creating a single currency which is the EU with its Euro, integration of trade and investment is a necessary condition. From a government-led perspective, commitment at the highest level of governments in ASEAN is important but requires real commitment from market players.",

            "text": "\n4.Value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This value of nominal GDP represents economic size. GDP is the most appropriate variable to express economic size of a country as this covers value added, return on input, and expenditure of final output ( Blanchard 2009). GDP is calculated from either: (1) the value of the final goods and services during a given period at its final price. The commodities (goods and services) in this definition are final commodities not partial intermediate commodities or (2) Total value added of commodities are at its intermediate price. Total value added of commodities is equal to the value of final commodities at final price. This measure uses intermediate commodities as a basis of measurement or (3) Total income in the economy at a given period. Value of the final commodities or its total value added is completely distributed to input factors in the form of wages, salaries, rents, etc. Therefore, total income in the economy would be equal to total value added or value of the final commodities at final price. Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.5.Value of Consumption (CONS). Consumption represents total output (goods and service) at final price consumed by consumers over a certain period. This variable is value of nominal consumption that represents equilibrium of supply and demand that is affected by disposable income. This definition makes it able to describe purchasing power of the country. As part of the GDP, consumption value is calculated at final price together with investment, government expenditure, and net export and import value. Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.6.Percentage of Economic Growth (GR). This variable represents \u201ceconomic performance.\u201d According to theory, economic growth is a positive indicator for investors to invest in long-run investment or FDI inflows ( Salvatore 2004). GDP has two types, nominal GDP and real GDP. Nominal GDP includes inflation rate (current price) while real GDP covers only constant prices that exclude the inflation rate. In measuring the economic growth, economists adopt real GDP as it represents growth of output and requires constant price. Economists use rate of economic growth as a proxy to review economic condition whether a country is in expansion, crises, recession, or in depression. Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.7.Number of Population (POP). This is a proxy to demand capacity. Economists use number of population as an indicator that reflects demand capacity. Economic size is reflected by both the GDP and number of population. A country with high population normally also has high nominal GDP. Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.8.Number of Employed Workers (EMPL). This represents the availability of productive production input of labor (L). Labor is an important input factor beside capital and Total Factor Productivity (TFP). In a macroeconomics perspective, population is divided into work force and non-work force ( Blanchard 2009). Work forces are population who are in their productive age (around 15\u201365 years old) and non-work forces are those who are out of this age range. Work forces are divided into labor forces and non-labor forces. Labor forces are work forces who are employed or seeking jobs. Non-labor forces are labor forces who are considered not as working such as housewives and students. This study uses number of employed workers as a proxy for employed labor force. This number represents productive production input. Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.9.Government Expenditure on Education (EDU). This variable is a proxy for human resource quality. This variable is to substitute unavailable data in R&D expenditure by country. Data of total spending on R&D in the observed countries cannot fulfill the time-series need. Some sources show that during the period of observation, in these three observed countries; R&D expenditure mainly comes from government budgets and the rest from the private sector. The other problem is the difficulty in getting detailed data on government budgets in the observed countries. In order to deal with this data availability problem, this study chose to use \u201cgovernment expenditure on education\u201d as a proxy, and this data also describes the government role in human resource development. Hypotheses sre (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.10.Electricity Consumption (ELECONS). This variable represents the availability of sound infrastructure. Electricity service and its coverage are important issues for the three observed countries. A supply of electricity is essential for the industrialization process. Electricity capacity is considered as the most appropriate variable to represent sound infrastructure. This study adopts electricity consumption. This describes the electricity consumption of the observed countries. This data is described in Yearly KWh (kilowatt hour per capita). Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.11.Degree of Openness (DOO). In macroeconomics theory there are three definitions for degree of openness: openness in factor of production, in financial markets, and in goods markets. This study adopts the latest variable of openness (goods). The formula is described as the percentage of total trade to GDP or TGDP. The formula is \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\mathrm{TGDP}=\\frac{X_{it}+{M}_{it}}{GD{P}_{it}} $$\\end{document}TGDP=Xit+MitGDPit where X\nit is value of exports of country i at time t; M\nit is value of imports of country i at time t; GDPit is Gross Domestic Product of country i at time t). This index could be higher than 1 (one). The higher the index, the more open is the country\u2019s economy. Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.12.Exchange Rate (ER). This variable is taken from the average exchange rate (domestic currency per US$). This variable represents economic stability. During Southeast Asia\u2019s economic crises, exchange rates incurred an unanticipated depreciation leading to devaluation. Hayakawa and Kimura\u2019s (2008) study found that exchange rates were the most important variable to describe economic uncertainty and competitiveness within production blocs in regional production networks. Exchange rate also represents a cost-of-service link. This means that a country with high volatility exchange rate will be difficult to incorporate with other countries in a production network as its exchange rate volatility endangers the entire network. Jones and Kierzkowski\u2019s (1990) study introduced the basic concept of the fragmentation between \u201cbefore\u201d (large integrated factory) and \u201cafter\u201d fragmentation (several production blocs (PB) being connected to each other with service links (SL)). Fragmentation of PB and SL makes the costs of transportation (logistic cost, insurance cost, trade cost, quality of infrastructure); administrative costs (custom clearance, loading\u2013unloading, COO Certificate) important to evaluate the effectiveness of regional integration process. Kiyota and Urata\u2019s (2004) study shows that exchange rate volatility has significant negative impact on Japanese FDI inflows in East Asian countries. According to the relative-value-of-wealth approach, the more depreciated a local currency of a host (developing) country, the more is the incentive for the investor in the home (developed) country to invest. Given that this study uses nominal exchange rates as local home currency per local host currency; therefore, the increasing ER generates disincentive for the investors to invest FDI inflows in host country. Hypotheses are (H0): Positive effect to FDI flows; (H1): Negative effect to FDI flows.13.FDI Profit (FDIPROFIT). This data is formulated by the World Bank in the form of value of Profit Remittance of FDI (in US$). The data is collected from the Global Development Finance. The World Bank defines this as \u201cpayments of direct investment income (debit side) which consist of income on equity (dividends, branch profits, and reinvested earnings) and income on the intercompany debt (interest).\u201d The data are part of Resource Flows at which the set form is on a yearly basis. This study adopts this data as a proxy for the profit advantage of the observed countries. This means that the higher profit remittance from FDI the higher value added of physical investment, then the more attractive that country is for investors. Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.14.Real Wage (RW). This is an approach to productivity of labor. It is based on the basic formula: P = W/MPL; P is price level; W is nominal wage; MPL is marginal productivity of labor. Therefore, productivity is MPL = W/P; In order to get general representative number of productivity, this study calculates MPL through the calculation of W/P. This is represented by the ratio of GDP per employment. This figure is obtained by dividing the value of GDP to the number of employment. Thus this number is divided by CPI (Consumer Price Index) in order to get the productivity value. Hypothesis are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.15.Intra-Regional Trade (INTRA). This variable is treated as the dependent variable when testing the impact of AFTA to trade creation ( intra-regional trade) of ASEAN. This study also uses INTRA as an independent variable when testing the relationship between trade creation and investment creation (FDI inflows). A previous study by Verico (2007) found that Intra ASEAN Trade affects FDI inflows in Southeast Asia. This study showed that the indicator of I is the most relevant indicator to calculate intra-trade in Southeast Asia. The formula is adopted from Frankel (1997) and is explained as follows:a\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {I}_{r,r}=\\frac{\\frac{X_{r,r}}{X_{r,w}}}{\\frac{X_{w,r}}{X_{w,w}}} $$\\end{document}Ir,r=Xr,rXr,wXw,rXw,w\n\nX\nr,r is value of export (country based) from region to region\nX\nr,w is value of export from region to world\nX\nw,r is value of export from world to region\nX\nw,w is value of export from world to worldAccording to Frankel (1997), there are two other functions for calculating intra-regional trade.

This condition will stimulate \u201c investment creation\u201d from non-members. This study also assumes that AFTA stimulates FDI inflows from non-member states but less than the CU\u2019s impact. The intra-regional trade variable in this study is intra-ASEAN trade of final products with Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand as representative of ASEAN. This formula represents total value of X and M from ASEAN to ASEAN divided by total ASEAN to the rest of the world. In order to avoid a double counting effect, Indonesia has been selected as an anchor. Therefore, her exports and imports to ASEAN are maintained while Malaysia\u2019s exports and imports have to be deducted when calculating that of Indonesia and Thailand; and Thailand\u2019s exports and imports are excluded when calculating that of Indonesia and Malaysia. Otherwise, for instance, Indonesia\u2019s export to Malaysia will double-count Malaysia\u2019s import from Indonesia. The same method is also applied in calculating X and M values for the rest of the world. Source of Data: Direction of Trade by Destination Country in US$, ADB. This calculation is confirmed with Intra-Regional Trade Index of ARIC Data Base.The intra-trade is intra-ASEAN trade in these three observed countries in ASEAN. It has been formulated as follows:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ in=\\frac{X_{r,r}+{M}_{r,r}}{X_{r,w}+{M}_{r,w}} $$\\end{document}in=Xr,r+Mr,rXr,w+Mr,w\n\nX\nr,r is value of export (country based) from region to region\nM\nr,r is value of import (country based) from region to region\nX\nr,w is value of export from region to world\nM\nr,w is value of import of region from the worldIntra-regional trade data have been adopted from the author\u2019s previous study ( Verico 2007).16 In order to get a comparative description, this study adopts the intra-regional trade (percent) of ASEAN from ARIC-ADB data of 2010 to compare with the author\u2019s calculation on Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Hypotheses for the intra-regional trade of ASEAN are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.16.Dummy AFTA. In theory FTA is designed to generate trade creation within the region. Some scholars argue that AFTA establishment was because of: (a) the end of Cold War in 1989, (b) settlement of Cambodian conflict, (c) augmenting economic integration in the EU from common market to financial integration after signing the Maastricht Treaty, (d) opening free market access for Mexico in USA after NAFTA assignation. This harmed ASEAN in two ways: (a) the USA is one of the largest destination markets, and (b) Mexico is one of the largest competitors for ASEAN products. AFTA represents progressive institutional development of ASEAN economic integration with its \u201cinter-governmental\u201d mechanism to increase intra-regional trading in Southeast Asia. For this purposes AFTA became legally binding for signatories ( Nesadurai 2003). AFTA was discussed officially in 1992 and signed the year after. AFTA Dummy represents regional trade cooperation among ASEAN members.17 Malaysia adopted AFTA CEPT by reducing its tariff in 1992 but Philippines did it in 1997, while the initiator of AFTA (Thailand) and CEPT designer (Indonesia) did it in 1998. This dummy uses 1999 as an anchor, therefore years after 1999 is 1 and years before 1999 is 0. AFTA was officially signed in 1992 but implementation took several years and the data sent signals that the most appropriate break point for dummy-time is 1999\u2014in particular two of the three observed countries in model of AFTA gave their commitment to the CEPT in 1998, and considering the impact of economic crises the most fit year is 1999. Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.17.Dummy BFTA (BFTA). The BFTA (Bilateral Free Trade Agreement) is unique for each country. Indonesia uses an anchor year of 2008, Malaysia and Philippines use 2005, and Thailand uses 2007. The first BFTA ever for ASEAN is Singapore\u2019s BFTA in 2002 and at this model the dummy time for representing the whole BFTA is 2004, since this was the first BFTA within these three countries. Hypotheses for the BFTA implementation are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows.\n",

Therefore, regional trade liberalization (AFTA) has to be completed with regional production liberalization (AICO) and regional investment liberalization (AIA).",

AFTA adopted regional affirmative action towards investors from member states and non-member states. This has been proven in the history of ASEAN particularly in relation to the regional economic policy of investment policies such as the ASEAN Industrial Project (AIP), ASEAN Industrial Complementary (AIC), ASEAN Industrial Joint Ventures (AIJV), ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO) and the most recent was the implementation of ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) in 1998, which came into force in 1999.

Several variables show significant and negative impact on intra-regional trade. They are economic size (Log GDP), purchasing power (Log GNP per capita), and degree of openness (DOO). These indicate that the higher the economic size, the stronger the purchasing power, and the more open economic relation of ASEAN, the more incentive for the member states to enhance economic relations with non-members. This will increase inter-economic relations rather than intra-regional trade in ASEAN. Both the non-system and system equations show that AFTA positively affects intra-regional trade yet it is still insignificant; therefore, ASEAN needs to enhance its AFTA regional economic cooperation. In system equation, number of employment (Log Employ) is significant and negative to intra-regional trade. In relation to significant and positive impact of labor productivity (Log RW) to intra-regional trade in non-system equation, ASEAN needs labor productivity rather than increasing numbers in employment. This study also finds, even it is still insignificant, that FDI inflows ( investment creation) affect intra-regional trade ( trade creation). The relations between intra-regional trade and FDI inflows are affecting each other.

Regarding the lag-effect this research use 1994 as the first year of dummy in which treated as 1 (one). However there was a revision done by the member states in September 1994 then this research also tried to use 1995 as the first year of dummy.

Considering Asian economic crises, this research attempted to test 1998 as time-dummy approach for the AFTA\u2019s establishment effect. Yet this dummy was still not satisfying the research, as it was known that two out of three observed countries in this Analysis (Indonesia and Thailand) fulfilled their commitment for the CEPT of ASEAN in 1998.

At the global level, there was the multilateral trade agreement GATT prior to WTO while at the same time many trade discrimination agreements have been concluded on the basis of the geographic proximity of members, such as the EU, NAFTA, Mercosur, and AFTA. These regional agreements create a set of mixed and complicated trade agreements globally. This term was adopted from the description of a complicated system of interchange rapid in Los Angeles. This term was first adapted to describe complicated conditions in various levels of trade when a scholar, Michael Stutchbury assessed NAFTA as a discriminating regional trade agreement vis-a-vis the principle of \u201copen regionalism\u201d (Stutchbury 1994, \u2018Taste Test for APEC as Miami Serves Spaghetti\u2019, Australian Financial Review, p. 27).The Doha Agreement suggested that BFTAs and other sub-regional arrangements do not complicate multilateral frameworks.\nVerico (2013a) found that BFTA with low significance level had negatively affected the intra-regional trade. This proved that the spaghetti or noodle-bowl phenomenon existed in the context of ASEAN intra-regional trade especially during the observation period.\n",
