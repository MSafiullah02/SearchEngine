We hypothesized that expression of SIRT1 would be reduced in these cells in COPD and that treatment with SIRT1 activators (resveratrol) and agents that prevent NAD depletion (theophylline) would upregulate SIRT1 expression and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in these steroid resistant cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Methods: Blood was collected from COPD patients and aged matched controls and expression of CD28, SIRT1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines determined in CD8+ and CD8-T and NKT-like cells cultured in the presence of AE 1\u03bcM resveratrol AE 5.0mg/mL theophylline AE 1 \u03bcM prednisolone using flow cytometry.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "CD28nullCD8+T and NKT-like cells compared with CD28+ counterparts from both patients and controls (eg., CD28null 7AE3% vs. CD28+ 55AE5%).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results: Decreased SIRT1 expression was identified in"}, {"text": "Loss of SIRT1 was associated with increased production of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 and steroid resistance.

Introduction/Aim: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an incurable cancer of the pleura that can be difficult to diagnose. Biomarkers for an earlier and/or easier diagnosis are urgently needed. The powerful gene regulators microRNA, have become popular diagnostic targets due to their stable expression within the body. Studies have examined microRNA in MPM and control samples, however it is still unclear which microRNA are potential biomarkers for MPM. Approximately 90% of patients develop pleural effusions which are an ideal source of diagnostic targets as sample collection is minimally invasive. The biomarker potential of microRNA in MPM frozen/fresh effusions is yet to be determined. We hypothesise that microRNA expressed in effusions are potential biomarkers for MPM.Methods: Taqman OpenArray profiling and real-time quantitative PCR were used to analyse microRNA in a cohort (Cohort 1) of 48 effusion cell and supernatant samples from MPM, lung adenocarcinoma and benign pleural disease patients. The potential microRNA biomarkers were then analysed in a second cohort (Cohort 2) of 60 MPM and lung adenocarcinoma samples.Statistics: MicroRNA expression was determined to be significantly different between diseases on a volcano plot with a 2 or more-fold change and a p< 0.05. MicroRNA combinations were analysed using logistic regression and diagnostic efficiency was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves.Results: An effusion cell signature based on the combination of miR-143, miR-210 and miR-200c for the diagnosis of MPM was identified in Cohort 1 (AUC -0.92) and validated in Cohort 2 (AUC -0.71). Conclusion: MicroRNA expressed in effusion cells are potential biomarkers for differentiating MPM from lung adenocarcinoma.

Various predicted equations have been used in the interpretation of DLCO. Recently the Global Lung Initiative (GLI) has been established with new reference equations for calculating DLCO. We aimed to assess the prevalence of low DLCO in younger smokers with normal spirometry using the GLI predicted equations.Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of subjects who have had both spirometry and TLCO measured at the Respiratory Laboratory at Monash Lung and Sleep, Monash Health. Subjects included males and females, aged 40 to 60 years with normal spirometry and significant smoking history. As sub-study, CT scanning was used to assess the prevalence of parenchymal lung diseases in this group. Initially, the ROCA (Roca J, 1990) predicted equations were used in the calculation of lower limit of normal (LLN). Subsequently the results were reanalysed with the GLI equations and both sets of data were compared.Results: We screened 15,226 lung function tests and identified 470 subjects aged between 40 and 60 with normal spirometry and a significant smoking histories. Of this cohort, 290 subject (60% of the group) had a TLCO below their lower limit of normal when using the ROCA equations. Subjects with the low DLCO had higher prevalence of emphysema and bronchiectasis on CT scanning. When GLI equations were applied, there was a markedly lower prevalence of low DLCO, with 24.3% of subjects in this cohort having a DLCO below LLN.Conclusion: A low transfer factor for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is prevalent amongst younger smokers with normal spirometry.

The Notch family of receptor proteins regulate airway mucus production via differentiation mechanisms that direct cells towards secretory or ciliated morphology. However little is known regarding Notch's role during mucus production, following differentiation.Aim/Hypothesis: To examine the impact of inhibiting Notch signalling on mucus production in fully differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells (pBECs) from control subjects as well as patients with asthma. We hypothesize that Notch inhibition will downregulate mucus production.Methods: pBECs from 5-6 donors of each cohort were grown at airliquid interface (ALI) culture for 25 days to promote multicellular differentiation. At this time, cells were treated with dibenzazepine (DBZ), a potent inhibitor of Notch signalling for a further 96h during which, apical lining fluid was collected every 24h for assessment of MUC5AC release. At the completion of the experiment, samples were also collected for protein, mRNA and histological analysis. To assess the direct role of Notch3 on MUC5AC, siRNA knockdown of Notch3 was also performed in monolayer cultures of human epithelial cells.Results: DBZ treatment significantly reduced MUC5AC expression and release in all phenotypes as assessed by qPCR, ELISA and IHC.Western blotting/qPCR revealed significant reduction of NOTCH3 intracellular domain (NICD3) and Notch3 mRNA in pBECs from all donor phenotypes. Notch3 siRNA knockdown significantly reduced MUC5AC protein.Finally, the goblet cell marker protein CLCA1 was unchanged across all treatments.Conclusion: Notch3 inhibition reduced MUC5AC expression and secretion from differentiated pBECs, independent of goblet cell number. This reduction is NOTCH3 dependent and occurs in pBECs from asthmatics and non-asthmatics. This suggests that Notch3 regulates MUC5AC production outside of Notch's well characterised role during secretory cell differentiation.Grant Support: NHMRC project grant #1064405.

However, the role of pulmonary rehabilitation in this group is unclear. This randomised controlled trial aimed to explore effects of home-based pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in people with mild COPD.Methods: People with mild COPD (FEV 1 /FVC<70%; FEV 1 >80%predicted) with a smoking history of \u2265 10 packet years were randomised to either 8-weeks of home-based PR (one home visit and seven onceweekly telephone calls) or attention control (weekly social telephone calls). Six-minute walk distance (6MWD), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) scores were compared between groups post intervention and at 6months.Results: A total of 58 participants (34 females, mean age 68 (SD 9) years, FEV 1 90 (7) %predicted, 6MWD 496 (105) metres) were included with 29 participants randomised to home-based PR. Participants attended an average of 6.8 of the eight scheduled sessions, ranging from three to eight sessions. Both groups showed improvements in exercise capacity, symptoms and health-related quality of life over time, however there was no between-group differences in the primary outcome of 6MWD at endintervention (mean difference 1.4 metres, 95% confidence interval (CI) -28.7 to 31.4 metres) or six months (9.8 metres, 95% CI -30.5 to 50.2 metres). At 6-months follow-up home-based PR participants were more likely to have clinically important improvements in CRQ emotional function (50% of home PR vs 0% control, p<0.001) and CRQ total score (45% vs 17%, p=0.05), however there were no other differences in symptoms or other aspects of health-related quality of life.Conclusion: For people with mild COPD, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation did not improve exercise capacity or health-related quality of life more than weekly social telephone calls.Grant Support: The Eirene Lucas Foundation and Institute for Breathing and Sleep.

Methods: People with COPD (FEV 1 < 80 % pred, FEV1 / FVC <70%, GOLD Grade \u2265 2) were block randomised to eight weeks of CPR with or without CBT (BREVE). Primary (six minute walk test (6MWT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs)) and secondary outcomes (breathlessness in daily life (Dyspnoea-12 (D-12), Multidimensional Dyspnoea Profile (MDP), quality of life (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) and habitual daily activity (accelerometry)) were assessed before and one, six and 12 months post intervention. Differences between groups were assessed with latent growth models (non-linear change) with and without covariates (age, sex, BMI, GOLD grade, comorbidity, smoking status and CPRP attendance) using both intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP: commenced intervention and valid 6MWT) approaches with p\u22640.05 significant. Results: 101 participants (mean age 70 AE SD 8.5, 54 males, FEV 1 % pred 47.7 AE 16.3) enrolled in the trial (n=88 for PP analysis). With the exception of CRQ and MDP subdomain scores, groups did not differ significantly in either trajectory or assessment points for primary or secondary outcomes (ITT, PP with and without covariates). For ITT, improvements in CRQ-Dyspnoea favoured CPRP + BREVE (unadjusted model p = 0.03) whereas reductions in MDP-Emotional Response favoured CPRP alone (adjusted model p = 0.03). For PP with and without adjustment for covariates, differences between groups for CRQ and MDP favoured CPRP alone (CRQ-Mastery p = 0.04; MDP-Immediate Perception p = 0.03; MDP-Emotional Response p = 0.04). Conclusion: In this cohort of people participating in CPRP, there was no clear additional short or longer term benefit of combining CPRP with CBT for breathlessness.

We present demographic and outcome data for patients undergoing care in the Austin Hospital Respiratory HDU, which provides single organ support for patients with acute respiratory failure. Methods: This retrospective audit describes all admissions to the Respiratory HDU during January to December 2016. Logistic regression was used to identify factors related to in-hospital mortality. Results: 82 patients, mean age 67.3 years (SD 16.83,) underwent 83 HDU admissions. 53% (44 patients) were male. Mean HDU length of stay (LOS) was 2.17 days (SD 2.15, 95% CI 1.71-2.63.) The main precipitating causes for respiratory failure were exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=25, 30.12%) and infection (n=23, 27.7%.) 25 admissions (30.12%) were for management of hypoxic respiratory failure, 9 of which were treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV). N=18 (21.69%) admissions occurred following a ward MET call and had an average HDU LOS of 1.5 days (SD 0.99, 95% CI 1.11-2.03.) 7 patients (8.4% of admissions) did not survive to hospital discharge. A higher ageadjusted Charlson comorbidity score was associated with higher inhospital mortality (OR 1.41, p=0.021, 95% CI 1.05-1.89.) Conclusion: The HDU has a high turnover of patients, including post-MET call care. Outcomes are generally good, however increased comorbidity as reflected by a higher age-adjusted Charlson score was associated with in-hospital mortality. A proportion of hypoxaemic patients received NIV, raising an opportunity for review of current practice. Grant Support: None.

In order to ensure equity of access to the required expertise, we established an ILD-MDM at Prince Charles Hospital (TPCH) in Brisbane which facilitated telemedicine and active participation of sites from elsewhere in Queensland.Methods:We reviewed all cases presented at the ILD-MDM from July 2014 to June 2017. The ILD-MDM included a minimum of 2 expert thoracic physicians, 1 radiologist and 1 histopathologist.Results: 313 referrals from 38 clinicians and 11 institutions were discussed. 38.3% were female, mean age 67 years, and 24.9% were from outside TPCH, including 1.9% from private practice. Mean FVC was 74.0% and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity 51.5%. Overall, 111 cases (35.5%) were classified as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 17 (5.4%) as combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, with the majority eligible for antifibrotic medication. 18 (5.8%) were classified as connective tissue disease, 12 (3.8%) chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, whilst 18.2% remained unclassifiable. There were 105 (33.5% patients) surgical lung biopsies (SLB) reviewed with 79% performed prior to first MDM presentation. In patients with a first presentation diagnosis of IPF, 65.6% had not had a prior SLB. 71 cases (22.7%) had highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) reported as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), a further 130 (41.5%) as possible UIP and 4.5% had inadequate imaging. Of 61 SLB showing definite UIP pattern, 63.9% had possible UIP and 19.7% UIP pattern on HRCT. In 22% of initial case presentations (n=69), further investigations were recommended including surgical lung biopsy (n=30), HRCT (n=26), bronchoscopy (n=4) and extended autoimmune screen (n=9).Conclusion:A telemedicine model is feasible and can facilitate equity of access for patients and clinicians where a low volume ILD caseload &/or absence of expertise precludes local establishment of the ILD-MDM.

The kangaroo exhibits a unique breathing mechanism when hopping: respiration depends more on motional forces and less on active contraction of the diaphragm. We asked how structural and mechanical properties of the kangaroo airway might accommodate the respiratory pressures generated during hopping. This study compared mechanical and structural properties of airways from kangaroos and sheep, the latter of which is not subject to the same motion-driven movement of air.Methods: Bronchial segments from kangaroos (n=8) and sheep (n=12) were mounted in an organ bath chamber. Pressure-volume curves were obtained between -10 and 20 cmH 2 O before and after theophylline. Airway stiffness was calculated from the change in pressure over normalized volume (\u0394 volume/initial volume). Closing pressure (pressure required for airway collapse) and airway wall morphology were also assessed. Data is meanAESEM.Results: The stiffness of kangaroo airways was less than in sheep (kangaroo, 6AE2 cmH 2 O; sheep, 16AE4 cmH 2 O; p<0.05). Theophylline caused a reduction in sheep airway stiffness (p<0.05) but had no effect on kangaroo airway stiffness, suggesting a role for smooth muscle tone in the former. Kangaroo airways also required a less negative pressure for collapse compared with sheep airways (kangaroo, -15AE3 cmH 2 O; sheep, -30AE3 cmH 2 O; p<0.05).The kangaroo airway had a thicker inner (p<0.05) and thinner outer wall (p<0.05) compared with the sheep airway. While the total thickness of cartilage was comparable between groups, there were a greater number (p<0.05) of smaller (p<0.05) cartilage plates in the kangaroo airway. migration and repair. Therefore, it was hypothesised that aberrant Notch signalling in asthmatic epithelium would result in defective repair by airway epithelial cells(AEC) via regulation of integrins.Methods: Tracheobronchial airway brushings of non-asthmatic (n=18; age range: 1.2-15.6yr; 8 males) and asthmatic (n=14; 3.3-16.9yr; 12 males) children were utilised for AEC isolation and culture. Notch receptor and ligand gene expression was investigated by qPCR (mean-AESEM; arbitrary units, AU). Notch signalling in cultures was inhibited with gamma secretase inhibitor, DAPT(N-[N-(3,5-Difluoro-phenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine-t-butyl ester) over a dose-range (1nM-10\u03bcM). Linear wounds were performed on AEC to assess repair (IncuCyte ZOOM \u00ae , Essen Bioscience). Integrin \u03b15\u03b21 protein expression was investigated by In-Cell\u2122 Western.Results: Notch receptors (NOTCH1-4) and ligands (JAG1-2, DLL1, 3, 4) were found to be expressed in ex vivo AEC from non-asthmatic and asthmatic children, however only NOTCH2 and JAG1 gene expression were differentially expressed in AEC from asthmatic children (NOTCH2, 10-fold downregulation[p<0.01]; JAG1, 3.5-fold upregulation[p<0.01]; n=6). Following in vitro wounding, NOTCH2 (2.92AE0.11AU) and JAG1(3.35AE0.14AU) mRNA levels were induced within 48hr in AEC of nonasthmatic children. However, an earlier induction of both NOTCH2 (2.58AE0.10 AU) and JAG1 (4.19AE0.09 AU) at 24hr post wounding was observed in AEC from asthmatic children. Global inhibition of Notch signalling resulted in a 40% reduction in wound repair and an inability to close the wound, observed at the maximal dose, 10\u03bcM. Furthermore, Notch signalling inhibition resulted in a reduction of \u03b15 integrin protein expression of 30% at 500 nM DAPT, but not \u03b21 integrin protein Conflict of Interest: All authors declare no conflict of interests. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that targeted RT-qPCR profiling can identify molecular abnormalities in EBUS bronchoscopy brushings collected from ROSE confirmed malignant lesions. Further investigation is warranted as to whether RT-qPCR can be used clinically to guide individualised therapeutic options. Methods: Consecutive series of patients who received nivolumab for advanced NSCLC on an intention-to-treat basis over a 30 months period between January 2015 and June 2017 at a large thoracic-oncology unit were identified. Outcomes in patients who had received radiation therapy to the chest as part of previous treatment prior to commencing nivolumab (RT group, n=20) were compared to an age, gender, tumour histology and performance status matched cohort of patients who did not receive previous radiation therapy (non-RT group, n=20).Results: The RT group had received a mean 53.3Gy (SD 12 .3) at a median of 12.4 months prior to commencing nivolumab. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.4 months (95%CI 2.2-4.5) in the RT group compared to 1.3 months (95%CI 1.0-1.7) in the non-RT group (p=0.01). The median overall survival was 8.4 months (95%CI 5. 1-11.6) in the RT group compared to 4.2 months (95%CI 1.0-7.7) in the non-RT group (p=0.08). The disease response on the initial assessment following starting nivolumab included nine (45%) patients who had stable disease or partial response in the RT group compared to five (25%) in the non-RT group after a median of four cycles of therapy. Rate of immune related complications were 35% (n=7) and 15% (n=3) in the RT and non-RT groups respectively (p=0.1). The RT group had a higher mean smoking pack years.Conclusion: This study demonstrates a novel finding of previous radiation therapy to the chest resulting in significantly higher PFS in patients treated with nivolumab for advanced NSCLC. A trend towards a higher rate of immune related adverse effects seen in the RT group may due to increased activity of the immunotherapy in these patients.

Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA Introduction/Aim: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most aggressive and frequent form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. Progression of IPF is variable between individuals and no established quantitative tools exist to assess its development. This work aims to integrate information from volumetric imaging with pulmonary function tests using a predictive computational model under the hypothesis that abnormalities on volumetric are not sufficient to explain increased lung stiffness and decreases in DLCO.Methods: Tissue regions in HRCT images from 8 patients with IPF were quantitatively analysed. Tissue abnormalities were classified using CALIPER (Computer-Aided Lung Informatics for Pathology Evaluation and Ratings) software. Tissue density (TD) distribution and volume of tissue (classified as reticular, ground-glass, normal and emphysema in each lung) were calculated. The classified data were mapped to a statistical shape model, which allows consistent comparison of regional tissue properties between patients or within one patient at different time points. Ventilation distribution and gas exchange were simulated in a computational model that was parameterised to each subject's lung tissue characterisation, to predict the relationship between V-Q matching, DLCO and disease distribution.Results: Fibrosis usually has a consistently higher TD (0.34/0.41 for reticular/ground-glass) compared to normal tissue (0.28), and presents predominantly in lower lobes (72%, 58%, 65% for honeycomb, reticular, ground-glass). In contrast, emphysema has lower density (0.08) and appears predominantly in upper lobes (73%). Model predictions of ventilation distribution and DLCO show that V-Q mismatch occurs due to redistribution of ventilation away from diseased regions, contributing to observed DLCO decreases.Conclusion: A quantitative analysis of the spatial distribution of IPF disease coupled with functional models provides a potential tool to improve assessment of the contributors to decline in IPF patient status over time. Decline in DLCO is a function of regional lung stiffness due to disease location combined with a redistribution of ventilation to 'normal' lung tissue.Grant Support:Introduction/Aim: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be associated with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic events. The efficacy and safety of treatment with nintedanib versus placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were assessed in the Phase II TOMORROW trial and 2 Phase III INPULSIS \u00ae trials. Exclusion criteria included: myocardial infarction in the previous 6 months, unstable angina in the previous month or stroke in the previous year. We assessed the effect of cardiovascular (CV) risk at baseline on the CV safety of nintedanib 150mg twice-daily.Methods: Incidence rates of major adverse CV events (MACE) in subgroups of patients with a history of atherosclerotic CV disease (CVD) and/or \u22651 CV risk factor (hypertension, dyslipidemia, body mass index >30 kg/m 2 , current/former smoking and diabetes) at baseline (higher CV risk) and patients with no history of atherosclerotic CVD and no CV risk factors at baseline (lower CV risk) were analysed using pooled data from the TOMORROW and INPULSIS \u00ae trials. Appropriate requesting of CTPA is important to both establishing an accurate diagnosis and minimizing unnecessary testing and radiation exposure. International and Waikato Hospital guidelines recommend pre-test probability scoring and D-dimer assay to stratify patients prior to performing CTPA.We aimed to determine the overall and departmental diagnostic yield of CTPA at Waikato Hospital. We also aimed to identify whether CTPA were ordered according to current guidelines.Methods: Medical records of 200 consecutive patients who underwent CTPA for suspected PE from 01 March to 31 May 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, referral source, clinical risk factors, D-dimer levels, diagnostic yield and additional CTPA findings were recorded. We utilized an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off. CTPA images were obtained using either a Siemens 128 or 256 slice multidetector CT scanner. Results were compared with international guidelines as well as similar local studies.Results: 41 (20.5%) patients had PE. Orthopaedics had the highest yield (36.4%), followed by Respiratory (32.9%) and General Surgery (18.8%). According to the Wells Score, 74 (37%) patients were low risk while 134 (63%) were High Risk. D-dimer was done in 108 (54%) patients. 34 (44.7%) patients in the low-risk group did not have D-dimer. Two patients who had low wells score and negative D-dimer received CTPA, neither had PE. Of the 14 patients referred by cardiology, none had positive scans. On review, only one patient had CTPA requested inappropriately (low wells score, D-dimer not done).Conclusion: Diagnostic yield of CTPA in Waikato Hospital is consistent with international standard. D-dimer has not been adequately used as a rule out test. Adherence to diagnostic protocol could potentially improve positive yield.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ingelheim."}, {"text": "No funding or financial support was received from any organization.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Grant Support:"}]}
