The enteral route is rarely used as a sole source of fluid therapy in neonates with diarrhoea.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment"}, {"text": "Initial volume replacement depends upon the degree of hypovolaemia. With hypovolaemic shock, a combination of crystalloid and colloid replacement is often recommended, especially in neonates, as many foals with enteritis or enterocolitis have some degree of protein loss within the gastrointestinal tract. Initial crystalloid volume replacement is best provided with a balanced electrolyte solution. Initial boluses of 10-20 ml/kg bwt i.v. can safely be given over 30 min and repeated as indicated by response to therapy. Other options include physiological saline solution or isotonic bicarbonate, but they are typically used to address specific strong ion imbalances, hyperkalaemia or severe metabolic academia of inorganic origin. Hyponatraemia should be addressed cautiously, increasing systemic sodium concentration at a rate no greater than 0.5 mmol/l/h (Magdesian 2005) . After initial resuscitative therapy, maintenance fluid administration (100 ml/kg bwt/day for neonates, 50 ml/kg bwt/day for foals over 30 days of age) can be initiated, normally with isotonic balanced electrolyte solutions or isotonic bicarbonate. Rarely, relatively hypotonic maintenance Oral supplementation can also be administered if electrolyte or bicarbonate deficits exceed volume deficits. Baking soda (1 g = 12 mmol HCO3) can be administered orally (separately from opportunities to nurse for suckling foals). Oral administration of light salt (consists of 1 : 1 KCl : NaCl) can provide adequate replacement for smaller deficits (0.1 g/kg bwt per os q. 8-12 h). Water and electrolytes can be administered via nasogastric tube, considering the gastric capacity, rate of gastric emptying and potential for ileus when applicable.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 860, "end": 876, "text": "(Magdesian 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment"}, {"text": "Colloidal therapy is useful in adult patients with hypovolaemic shock, hypoproteinaemia (total protein <40.0 g/l) or clinical signs of oedema, as they typically remain within the intravascular space (Magdesian 2003; Seahorn and Seahorn 2003) . Hyperimmune plasma (10 ml/kg bwt/h, normally 1-2 l) not only provides plasma proteins to improve vascular oncotic pressure but also immunoglobulins of use to the neonatal or critical foal (Porter and Green 2003; Sykes and Furr 2005) . Compromised neonatal foals with failure of transfer of passive immunity (IgG less than 8.0 g/l) should receive at least 1 l of plasma for provision of immune factors. For foals with ongoing gastrointestinal protein loss, administration of plasma can be repeated either as bolus therapy or a CRI at 1-2 ml/kg bwt/h. Serial testing of IgG concentrations in sick neonates can guide the need for additional plasma due to loss or consumption from the primary disease process. Hetastarch (3-5 ml/kg bwt i.v. boluses up to 10 ml/kg bwt/day maximum) can be used for initial resuscitation in hypovolaemic shock in conjunction with plasma or as a less expensive replacement colloid (Jones et al. 1997; McFarlane 1999) .

A typical initial broad-spectrum regimen includes amikacin (22-25 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h) or gentamicin (6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h in foals >2 weeks, 12 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h <2 weeks) combined with potassium penicillin (22,000-44,000 u/kg bwt i.v. q. 6 h) or ampicillin (25 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 6 h) (Durr 1976; Brown et al. 1984; Ensink et al. 1996; Magdesian et al. 1998; Mckenzie and Furr 2003; Bucki et al. 2004; Corley and Hollis 2009 ).

Ceftiofur (5 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 12 h) or cefquinome (1 mg/kg bwt i.v. or i.m q. 24 h) can be used as a monotherapeutic approach for broad-spectrum prophylaxis (Allan 2003; Thomas et al. 2006; Meyer et al. 2009; Rodich et al. 2009; Widmer et al. 2009 ). Broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment is indicated for treatment of foals with known Salmonella infection (particularly if less than 90 days of age) and this treatment should continue past clinical recovery to prevent potential secondary sites of infection (Lester 2003) . For suspected or proven clostridial infections, metronidazole (15 mg/kg bwt per os q. 6-8 h or 25 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h, 15 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 6 h) is recommended (Sweeney et al. 1986; Gigu\u00e8re 2008) , based upon regional patterns of resistance (Magdesian et al. 2002) .

Length of treatment is dictated by clinical status and improvement of clinicopathological findings but a minimum of 3 weeks of treatment is likely indicated (Pusterla and Gebhart 2009) . In cases of rhodococcal enterocolitis, treatment is similar to pulmonary R. equi, generally using a combination of macrolide (azithromycin at 10 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h or clarithromycin at 7.5 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h) and rifampin (5 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 182, "text": "(Hollis et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 183, "end": 206, "text": "Corley and Hollis 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 207, "end": 229, "text": "Frederick et al. 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 532, "end": 543, "text": "(Durr 1976;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 544, "end": 562, "text": "Brown et al. 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 563, "end": 582, "text": "Ensink et al. 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 583, "end": 605, "text": "Magdesian et al. 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 606, "end": 629, "text": "Mckenzie and Furr 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 630, "end": 648, "text": "Bucki et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 649, "end": 671, "text": "Corley and Hollis 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 971, "end": 983, "text": "(Allan 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 984, "end": 1003, "text": "Thomas et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1022, "text": "Meyer et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1042, "text": "Rodich et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1061, "text": "Widmer et al. 2009", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1336, "text": "(Lester 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1504, "end": 1525, "text": "(Sweeney et al. 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1539, "text": "Gigu\u00e8re 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1608, "text": "(Magdesian et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1910, "end": 1941, "text": "(Atherington and McKenzie 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1942, "end": 1954, "text": "Frazer 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1955, "end": 1981, "text": "Pusterla and Gebhart 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1982, "end": 2003, "text": "Sampieri et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2163, "end": 2190, "text": "(Pusterla and Gebhart 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment"}, {"text": "There are numerous antidiarrhoeal agents available, with varying amounts of evidence supporting their use.

The benefits of continued oral intake often outweigh the risk of exacerbation of enteritis by additional suckling. Oral intake of as little as 60 ml of milk every few hours can provide nutrition for enterocytes (Ousey et al. 1997) . Any foal with colic, abdominal distention or suspected rotavirus or clostridial infection will likely benefit from a period of brief gastrointestinal rest (12-24 h) (Magdesian 2005) . Villous damage can result in transient maldigestion and lactase deficiency, thus exogenous lactase (Lactaid, 3000-6000 FCC units per os q. 6 h) during re-feeding is a useful adjunct in some foals (McAuliffe and Slovis 2008; Sloet van Oldruitenborgh-Oosterbaan 2008) . For foals kept from suckling for longer than 12-24 h in older foals or 4-6 h in neonates, caloric requirements should be provided parenterally (Buechner-Maxwell 1998; Magdesian 2005 ). The addition of dextrose (typically 5% of a maintenance fluid rate or a rate of 4-8 mg/kg bwt/ min i.v.) to fluid therapy is adequate to meet caloric requirements for up to 24-48 h. For more intensive or prolonged cases that cannot tolerate oral nutrition, partial or total parenteral nutrition (PPN or TPN) can be provided with the addition of amino acids with or without lipids to dextrose solutions. There is significant information available elsewhere regarding the preparation and administration of these TPN solutions (Buechner-Maxwell 2005; McKenzie and Geor 2009) . Although it can be costly to administer, provision of parenteral nutrition can prevent a catabolic state associated with prolonged malnutrition.

Separate clothing and footwear should be used for affected animals, be they permanent and disinfected between animals or disposable. Footbaths and careful handwashing procedures are very important for minimising contamination, along with disinfection of all in-contact items. Quaternary ammonium disinfectants are effective against most bacterial pathogens and phenolic disinfectants (One-Stroke 2 and Tek-trol 3 ) are effective against rotavirus, even when contaminated with organic matter.
