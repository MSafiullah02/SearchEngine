A number of coronaviruses have been described. They include the human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 and a number of animal coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (Stadler et al., 2003, Holmes, 2003). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV include the large type I membrane glycoprotein spike (S) (\u223c200 kDa), which binds to the receptor, the nucleoprotein (N) (\u223c45.9 kDa), the membrane glycoprotein or matrix protein (M) (\u223c25 kDa), and the small envelope protein (E) (\u223c14 kDa) (Stadler et al., 2003, Ying et al., 2004). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE-2 receptor, assumed to be absent from monocyte/macrophage surfaces (Harmer et al., 2002), was recently identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV entry into the permissive cell line Vero E6 (Li et al., 2003b).",

The virus can bind, enter, and uncoat in cells within 30 min (Ng et al., 2003a). Ultrastructural characterization studies demonstrate replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells by virions, which bud upon the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and migrate to the cell surface while within the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, where they will then be extruded to the extracellular space (Ng et al., 2003a, Ng et al., 2003b; Goldsmith et al., 2004). Extracellular virus particles can be seen accumulating in large quantities along the plasma membranes of the infected cells (Ng et al., 2003b, Goldsmith et al., 2004).",

It is well known that by producing IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, monocytes/macrophages participate in inducing resistance to viral replication. The cytokines activate cellular genes that destroy viral mRNA and inhibit the translation of proteins. In addition, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induce major histocompatibility complex class I protein expression in infected cells, increasing the level of protein presentation to CD8+ T cells and the ability of uninfected cells to resist killing by natural killer cells (Goodbourn et al., 2000).",

When anti-S mAb became available, we used it to test mock-infected and SARS-CoV-infected PM from four donors (B, D, H, and I) for SARS S protein (Fig. 4 inset). This mAb reacts with a single \u223c200 kDa protein from SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2). We found that donor PM that were reactive to the HCS were also reactive with the mAb to S protein. Similarly, the absence of S protein in the PM of infected donors H and I was consistent with the absence of other SARS-CoV proteins that could be detected by the HCS. Thus, infection of PM with SARS-CoV was successful in some but not all PM studied. We tested donors C and F for the production of infectious virus. Very low virus titers (102\n TCID50/ml) were obtained from donor F, and no infectious virus was secreted by infected PM from donor C.

In cells from three of the nine donors studied (donors A, H, and I), significant levels of IFN-\u03b1 (\u223c60\u2013260 U/ml) were measured following SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, SARS-CoV protein was not detected in these donor PM. In the remaining six donors, B\u2013G, absent or low levels of IFN-\u03b1 (\u22648 U/ml) were detected following infection. SARS-CoV proteins could be observed in cells from four of these six donors (B\u2013E) (Table 1). We examined the age, race, and sex of the donors to determine whether any of these parameters influenced the response to SARS-CoV (Table 1). Due to the small number of donors, we were unable to convincingly show that any of these factors influenced the results we obtained. Despite secreting low levels of IFN-\u03b1, SARS-CoV proteins failed to be detected in Donor G. We were unable to identify a reason for this variation from the pattern seen with other donors.

Within the cytoplasm, SARS-CoV virions were seen aggregated in enlarged membrane-bound structures presumed to be phagolysosomes (Fig. 6B), although the phagocytic nature of these structures has yet to be confirmed. None of the morphologic features indicative of viral replication were detected in the PM culture from donor B, including nascent viral particles forming on cytoplasmic membranes, double-membrane vesicles, the proposed replication complex for coronaviruses, or the adherence of virions to the cell surface.",

Electron microscope studies suggest that SARS-CoV might enter a non-IFN-\u03b1-producing PM by phagocytosis rather than by adhesion to the cell surface and membrane fusion as seen in more permissive cells, but further examination would be necessary to determine the actual mode of viral entry into monocytes and macrophages.

Flow cytometric studies of SARS-CoV-infected cells detected no S protein on the cell surface, thus further suggesting that PM may lack a specific receptor for SARS entry. Electron microscope studies suggested differences in the replication process between PM and the more permissive Vero E6 cells. Replicating centers seen in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells were absent in the infected PM that were examined. Most significantly, SARS-CoV infection of PM appeared to be inhibited by the presence of IFN-\u03b1. SARS-CoV antigens were not detected in PM that produced significant levels of IFN-\u03b1 (>10 U/ml); however, they were detected in PM producing <10 U/ml IFN-\u03b1 (the PM were from four of six donors) and in cells producing significant levels of IFN-\u03b1 after IFN-\u03b1-neutralizing antibody was added to the culture system. Taken together these data suggest human monocytes/macrophages can support low-level productive infection by SARS-CoV and that the level of infection can be modified by IFN-\u03b1.",

In contrast, OC43 infected monocytes poorly, failed to induce increased apoptosis, and released low amounts of infectious virus (Collins, 2002). Our studies of SARS-CoV-infected PM suggest that like OC43, SARS-CoV also infects monocytes/macrophages poorly. Both viruses may lack a viable receptor for entry into monocytes. PBMC of SARS patients were also examined for evidence of infection and replication of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003a). In this report, minus-strand RNA copies of the SARS-CoV genome were observed in PBMC and used as indicators of replicating virus. However such intermediates were not long lasting and could not be detected 6 days after infection (Li et al., 2003a).",

Expression of SARS-CoV proteins in type I pneumocytes of infected macaques was also severely reduced after prophylactic treatment of the SARS-CoV-infected monkeys with IFN-\u03b1 (Haagmans et al., 2004). A reduction in viral replication and excretion, in protein expression in pneumocytes, and in pulmonary damage were all noted in infected macaques who were treated compared with infected macaques who were not treated (Haagmans et al., 2004).

            "text": "The role that SARS-CoV infection of monocytes/macrophages plays in the course of the disease in humans is yet to be determined. The role could be more important than would otherwise be indicated by the low level of productive infection, given the importance of these cells in guiding the immune response to infection through antigen presentation and cytokine production. Our data suggest that differences in levels of IFN-\u03b1 production with infection may occur, as indicated by infection in monocytes/macrophages, and such differences could contribute to the disease course. For example, co-infection with a paramyxovirus, human metapneumovirus, has been noted in some SARS-infected patients, and this infection has been hypothesized to render some persons more susceptible to SARS-CoV disease (Chan et al., 2003, Stephenson, 2003). Although human metapneumovirus infections have not been described previously as interfering with IFN-mediated antiviral responses, other paramyxoviruses have been shown to interfere with such responses (Gotoh et al., 2001, Bossert et al., 2003). Thus, it is possible that such interference could facilitate SARS-CoV infection. Another example where variability in IFN-\u03b1 production could explain differences in disease outcome is the association between increasing severity of disease with increasing age. Young children appear to be the least susceptible and the elderly the most susceptible to serious complications of infection (Wong et al., 2003). It is known that IFN-\u03b1 levels are highest in the young and decrease with age (Katschinski et al., 1994, Shodell and Siegal, 2002). Perhaps age-associated variations in IFN-\u03b1 production may help explain age-associated differences in SARS-CoV disease.",
