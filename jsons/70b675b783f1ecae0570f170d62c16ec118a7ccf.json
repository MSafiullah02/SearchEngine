The authors found that 161 (93.1%) of 173 patients included in the study tested positive for total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a sensitivity starting to raise one week after the onset of symptoms. Based on these findings, the authors stated that antibody testing may be helpful to supplement the RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, which is still the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Interestingly, total antibodies had a median seroconversion time shorter than those of IgM and IgG antibodies (11 days vs 12 and 14 days, respectively), and were potentially related to disease severity (their titer peaked sooner in patients with more severe COVID-19 forms).",

This is a major concern for clinicians worldwide because of cases of patients with COVID-19 recurrence reported until now [2] ; in our opinion, neutralizing antibody titers would be determined as an optimal diagnostic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. an. Furthermore, differences in sensitivity across the three groups of antibodies (i.e., total, IgM, and IgG) detected by Zhang et al. are probably attributable to the presence of the IgA in the total antibody group. It has been observed that secretory IgA antibodies are very effective in defending against respiratory infections [3] , as well as previous studies on SARS-CoV have shown similar kinetics of IgA, IgM, and IgG [4, 5] , making IgA detection an attractive option as a specific diagnostic marker; hence, a dedicated focus on the kinetics and clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgA is warranted.",
