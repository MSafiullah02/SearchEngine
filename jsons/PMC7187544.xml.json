            "text": "Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs found in eukaryotic cells that operate as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression (He and Hannon 2004). They regulate the abundance of target mRNAs by guiding the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to cleave the corresponding complementary sequence. As changes in the 21-nt-long miRNA sequence do not affect miRNA biogenesis and maturation (Vaucheret et al. 2004; Guo et al. 2005), it is possible to redesign the miRNA sequence to target different transcripts using different pre-miRNAs as backbones (Niu et al. 2006; Schwab et al. 2006; Qu et al. 2007; Warthmann et al. 2008). One application of this technology is to produce plants expressing artificial miRNAs (amiRs) targeting viral genomes, thus conferring resistance to viral infection (Niu et al. 2006; Qu et al. 2007). Niu et al. (2006) used the pre-miRNA159a precursor as backbone to construct two different amiR159 with sequences complementary to the RNA genome of turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) and turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). In short, the original sequences forming the stem of the pre-miRNA159a were replaced by the appropriate viral target sequences in complementary polarities to maintain the correct stem\u2013loop structure and subsequent processing by the DCL1 nuclease (Niu et al. 2006). Transgenic expression of these amiRs in Arabidopsis thaliana conferred high levels of specific resistance against the corresponding virus. Similarly, a gene-silencing mechanism (RNAi) has been used in in vitro assays as antiviral agent to inhibit the replication of human viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1; Coburn and Cullen 2002), hepatitis C virus (Kr\u00f6nke et al. 2004), and influenza A virus (Ge et al. 2003). In all these experiments, a single amiR was expressed, and thus, resistance strictly depended on the match between this amiR and the corresponding viral sequence.",

These variants differ from the wild-type (WT) virus by at least one point mutation in the 21-nt target leading to imperfect matching with the corresponding amiR and hence to inefficient or ineffective processing by RISC (Westerhout et al. 2005; Sabariegos et al. 2006; von Eije et al. 2008). Although the RNAi machinery tolerates changes in some positions of the 21-nt target, it is sensitive to changes in some others, particularly at the center of the target site (Elbashir et al. 2001; Westerhout and Berkhout 2007; Lin et al. 2009). Moreover, it has been shown that the 21 TuMV genotypes resulting from introducing every single synonymous mutation in the 21-nt target that successfully infected transgenic plants expressing amiR accumulated additional changes at alternative sites within the 21-nt target, further jeopardizing the resistance of the transgenic plants (Lin et al. 2009).",

However, the relevance of these escape variants in natural viral populations has not been clarified. In other words, to evaluate the viability of antiviral therapies based on the transgenic expression of amiRs in plants, it is essential to understand how likely are viral populations to contain escape variants, which may be subsequently transmitted to immunized plants. Moreover, it is also crucial to evaluate whether variation in the expression of amiR transgenes in different tissues or at different stages of plant development, especially at subinhibitory concentrations, might affect the accumulation and evolution of viral escape mutants. More specifically, we are interested in addressing the following issues: 1) What is the likelihood of virus escape mutations arising and accumulating in a WT host population? 2) Does partial resistance favor the accumulation of escape mutants? 3) At what frequencies are these mutant viruses maintained in susceptible hosts? and 4) What sites in the 21-nt target are more critical for escaping from amiR surveillance?",

At each passage until resistance was broken (Lafforgue et al. 2011), we evaluated the infectivity of the evolving populations in transgenic A. thaliana plants (line 12-4) that were fully resistant to the ancestral virus due to high-level expression of amiR159-HCPro, an engineered variant of miRNA159 that is complementary to 21 nt within the TuMV cistron that encodes for the multifunctional protein HC-Pro (Niu et al. 2006). In the same work, we addressed the second issue, by evolving in the same way 25 additional TuMV lineages in A. thaliana transgenic plants (line 10-4) expressing the amiR159-HCPro at subinhibitory concentrations. Our results showed that TuMV populations replicating in both susceptible hosts (WT and 10-4) accumulated resistance-breaking alleles, resulting in overcoming the resistance of 12-4 plants. The rate at which resistance was broken was significantly faster for TuMV populations experiencing subinhibitory concentrations of the antiviral amiR159-HCPro during their evolution, thus suggesting that TuMV escape alleles were at higher frequencies in the partially resistant plants, possibly because of a selective advantage. This previous study mainly focused on making quantitative inferences about the likelihood of resistance breaking. We confirmed that resistance breaking had a genetic basis by characterizing the consensus sequence of the TuMV population isolated from the 12-4-resistant plants that first showed infection symptoms. However, we did not determine whether escape mutants were already present in the evolving populations before being inoculated in the 12-4 plants nor the level of polymorphism in the population replicating in these plants (especially whether they contained a fraction of nonresistant TuMV genotypes).",

On the other hand, next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques can generate massive amounts of genetic data, which can be used to detect variants at much lower frequencies (Wang et al. 2007; Eriksson et al. 2008; Solmone et al. 2009; Cordey et al. 2010; Eckerle et al. 2010; Murcia et al. 2010; Zagordi et al. 2010; Willerth et al. 2010; Bunnik et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2011; Wrigth et al. 2011). In this study, we have generated tens of millions of short reads with Illumina sequencing to obtain an unprecedented ultradeep coverage of amiR targets in the TuMV genome, thus characterizing in great detail the genetic composition of TuMV lineages evolving in WT and 10-4 plants at different time points during the experimental evolution process and right after the first successful infection of 12-4-resistant plants. Although in general the limited length of Illumina reads makes it difficult to assess linkage among mutations, in our particular case this was not an issue because the 21-nt sequences corresponding to the amiR159-HC-Pro target were completely covered by the 76-nt-long reads. The validity of the Illumina technology for assessing virus diversity has been proved with studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Eckerle et al. 2010), human rhinovirus (Cordey et al. 2010), HIV-1 (Willerth et al. 2010), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (Wrigth et al. 2011).",

Saps were obtained by grinding-infected tissues with 20 volumes of grinding buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0, 3% polyethylene glycol 6000). Aliquots of 5 \u00b5l 10% carborundum were applied to three different A. thaliana leaves, and inoculation was done mechanically by gentle rubbing with a cotton swab soaked with infectious sap. Twenty-five WT and 25 transgenic 10-4 A. thaliana plants were inoculated. Each plant represented the starting point for an independent evolutionary lineage. Fourteen days postinoculation (dpi), symptomatic tissue was collected for each lineage and ground in a mortar with liquid N2 and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. A portion of the ground tissue was extracted with grinding buffer and used to inoculate the next set of plants. A second portion was used for the pathogenicity tests in 12-4 plants. A third portion was used to purify RNA for reverse-transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of TuMV cDNA.",

Figure 1A illustrates the quality scores Qi of the sequence reads translated into error probabilities Pi. The Qi associated with each nucleotide decreased toward the end of the reads, as the reliability of the sequencing process decreases with the number of cycles in the Illumina sequencing platform; therefore, Pi increased along the reads. After discarding reads with an average P > 0.2%, the error profile became flatter (dashed line in fig. 1A). The number of valid reads varied widely among lineages and among samples within each lineage. For L20.Col-0, the number of valid reads ranged from 291,348 for passage 9 to 858,037 for passage 15 or to 598,784 for the 20th passage, when the resistance of 12-4 plants was broken, with a median value of 485,318.

The power law relationship between the number of valid reads and of detected haplotypes (R2 = 0.962, F1,30 = 749.42, P < 0.001) imposes a certain degree of uncertainty about the number of different haplotypes existing in each viral population sampled: as the power law has no asymptotic value, the more reads analyzed the more new haplotypes detected. In other words, an infinite number of valid reads would be necessary to estimate the exact number of haplotypes contained in a viral population. This being said, we can still make some valid inferences from our data. For instance, we can ask whether the number of haplotypes differed significantly between samples and/or lineages. For lineage L20.Col-0, the number of haplotypes per passage ranged between 19 (for passage 8) to 287 (for passage 20), with a median value of 28. Interestingly, the median number of haplotypes was larger for the three lineages evolved in the partially resistant 10-4 plants: for lineage L1.10-4, the number spanned between 44 and 256 (median 114), for lineage L10.10-4 between 38 and 255 (median 41), and for lineage L11.10-4 between 29 and 129 (median 57). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the log number of haplotypes using lineage as random factor and the log number of valid reads as covariable revealed a significant difference in the median number of haplotypes between the lineage evolved in WT and the three lineages evolved in 10-4 plants (F4,24 = 9.072, P < 0.001). In other words, the expression of subinhibitory amounts of an amiR by the host plant facilitates the accumulation of genetic variability in the virus amiR target. Furthermore, the analysis also detected a significant effect of the random factor on the slope of the regression line (F3,24 = 5.595, P = 0.005), which suggests that the underlying power law relationship may be different for each experiment. In this study, we are not exploring further whether this difference in slopes among lineages reflects some underlying biological process, or, in contrast, it may result from some more trivial reasons (e.g., the fact that the number of reads is different for each lineage).",

The last passage represented, the 20th, corresponds to the infectivity test in which lineage L20.Col-0 broke the amiR159-HCPro-mediated resistance of 12-4 plants for the first time. Several striking conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, and most notably, no less than 21 potential escape alleles were present in the evolving population from the very beginning of the evolution experiment. The median frequency of haplotypes carrying potential escape mutations across passages was 0.02%. Indeed, the haplotype containing the escape mutation C11U that turned out to be the most abundant one in the population infecting the 12-4 plants at passage 20 (62.88%) also had the highest population frequency during most intermediate passages (ranging from 0.02% at passage 18 to 0.09% at passage 11; median 0.06%) except in passages 9 and 10. The second most abundant haplotype (17.73%) found in the 12-4 plants had mutation G12A; four other haplotypes had frequencies in the range 4.82\u20131.23%. Interestingly, when the diversity indexes k and \u03c0 were computed pooling data from consecutive passages, we found that k was 13.3-fold larger in the comparison between passages 19 and 20 (k = 0.096) than in any other of the previous 19 pairs (average k = [7.215 \u00b1 0.162] \u00d7 10\u22123; z-score, P < 0.001). Similarly, \u03c0 was 25.6-fold larger (z-score, P < 0.001) in the comparison between passages 19 and 20 (\u03c0 = 4.575 \u00d7 10\u22123) than across all the other pairs (average \u03c0 = [3.435 \u00b1 0.077] \u00d7 10\u22124). These results suggest that the viral population composition changed substantially after the TuMV population was moved from WT to 12-4 hosts.",

Rather, the TuMV genotype that finally overcame the resistance of 12-4 plants was randomly chosen among the many coexisting ones. This can be explained by the transmission bottlenecks followed by strong selection of resistance alleles in presence of the amiR159-HCPro. Indeed, that breaking resistance does not depend only on the previous presence of escape mutation is supported by two additional sources of evidence. First, there is no correlation between the frequency of the different haplotypes in the 12-4 plant (the 20th passage) and their median frequency across the different passages in WT plants (Spearman\u2019s rS = \u22120.195, 48 df, P = 0.176). Second, Tajima\u2019s D statistic was significantly smaller than zero in every passage (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), thus suggesting that the observed excess of low-frequency polymorphisms can be simply explained by the population bottlenecks associated with each transmission event. These results support the hypothesis of Lafforgue et al. (2011) that TuMV populations evolving in WT plants were at the mutation\u2013drift balance.\n",

Interestingly, 25 of these haplotypes carried two mutations in the amiR159-HCPro target, in comparison with all the 21 pre-existing haplotypes, all of which had only a single-nucleotide substitution, being the difference in the number of mutations per haplotype between both groups statistically significant (Fisher\u2019s exact test P < 0.001). Eighteen of these double-mutant haplotypes contained the most abundant mutation C11U, four of them contained the second most abundant mutation G12A, and one contained both mutations. The other three double-mutant haplotypes had mutations G16C/A18G, G14A/A18G, and C17U/A19C. Mutation A18G was already detected in most passages in WT plants. In contrast, mutation A19C was the third most common single-mutation haplotype found in the 12-4 plant (passage 20), but it was not observed in any of the previous passages in WT plants. Therefore, we can conclude that most of these double-mutant haplotypes arose when resistance was broken and resulted from imperfect replication of pre-existing single-mutation haplotypes that were strongly selected on inoculation in 12-4 plants. This result is in good agreement with the observation by Lin et al. (2009) that additional mutations in the amiR target arise and facilitate escape.",

The presence of the ancestral TuMV sequence in 12-4 plants can be explained by three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses. First, the ancestral TuMV genome is capable of evading amiR resistance only when it represents a minor fraction of the population, suggesting that the efficiency of the RNA silencing machinery in detecting allelic variation in the target depends on a threshold concentration. Second, the escape mutants that dominate the population express the silencing suppressor HC-Pro that interferes with the RNA silencing machinery and blocks its action. The ancestral TuMV genotypes simply take advantage of this situation by coinfecting cells along with mutant viruses. Third, the ancestral TuMV sequence is being constantly created by back mutation from the other more abundant mutant genotypes. We find this third possibility less plausible than the others. Using a recent estimate of TuMV mutation rate in A. thaliana (De la Iglesia et al. 2012) of \u223c6 \u00d7 10\u22125 per replication event and the fact that TuMV replication mostly proceeds by a stamping machine (Mart\u00ednez et al. 2011), the expected population frequency of reversion mutants produced by backward mutation during replication of the numerically dominant resistant haplotype should be \u223c0.006%, a value about 115-fold smaller than the observed frequency. Therefore, we can conclude that the observed frequency of TuMV genomes carrying the ancestral amiR159-HCPro target sequence is much higher than expected by backward mutation and, therefore, likely to be a consequence of inefficient RNA silencing machinery or of complementation with escape mutants during cell coinfection.",

Figure 2B shows the evolution of diversity in each of the 21 nt in the amiR159-HCPro target. During the 19 passages in WT plants, all positions of the amiR159-HCPro target showed variability. Under the hypothesis of neutral accumulation of mutations, we should expect all sites to show approximately the same variability. Furthermore, under the same assumption, we should expect this variability to fluctuate around a value resulting from a balance between mutation and the stochastic genetic drift associated with the passage events. To explore whether the first expectation would hold up, we fitted the frequency data to an ANCOVA model in which variability at each nucleotide site was treated as a random variable and passage as a covariable. This analysis detected significant differences among nucleotide sites (F21,357 = 38.343, P < 0.001), thus rejecting the null hypothesis of all sites accumulating mutations at equal frequency. Further, a two-step cluster analysis found that the optimal number of groups into which sites could be classified was 6, with site 1 being the least variable one (average frequency across passages: 0.02%) and site 11 accumulating almost twice as many variants (average frequency across passages: 0.05%). The ANCOVA analysis also revealed that the frequency of variants per site remained constant along the experimental evolution process (F1,357 = 0.458, P = 0.499), which supports our second expectation. However, this equilibrium composition changed radically on successful infection of the transgenic 12-4 plant (passage 20; fig. 2B). In this new situation, 52.52% of the sequences, regardless their haplotype, had a change at position 11 of the amiR159-HCPro target. This change is a synonymous replacement. The second most variable site was position 12, with 22.24% of the sequences (again, regardless their haplotype) containing a mutation. This mutation results in the conservative amino acid replacement V to M. Positions 3, 9, 16, 17, 18, and 19 had frequencies of variation \u223c1%. This distribution of variation along the amiR159-HCPro target within a single evolutionary lineage matches the distribution of mutations found by Lafforgue et al. (2011) for 25 independent lineages. In that case, positions 11 and 12 were overwhelmingly associated with resistance breaking, and positions 17, 18, and 19 were also frequently associated with escapes. Using an heterologous system of transgenic A. thaliana plants expressing amiR159-P69 targeting an engineered TuMV genome that contained 21 nucleotides from the TYMV P69 cistron, Lin et al. (2009) showed that positions 3, 9, and 12 were critical for resistance breaking, although other sites, qualified as crucial (4, 5, and 6), did not show particularly high frequencies of variants in our study. In contrast, position 11 was considered as of moderate importance for resistance breaking (Lin et al. 2009), but turned out to be the most important one in our study. A critical difference between Lin et al. (2009) study and ours is that in their case the amiR159-P69 target sequence was neutral for the virus, whereas here the target is a coding region of TuMV HC-Pro cistron, and, consequently, mutations in successful escape variants must result from a balance between avoiding recognition by amiR159-HCPro and retaining biological function. Indeed, this neutrality effect may explain why Lin et al. (2009) observed an excess of critical positions at the 5\u2032-end of the amiR159-P69. The importance of the two central positions may be explained by the fact that imperfect pairing with central mismatches in small-RNA-target hybrids promotes translational repression as it excludes slicing (Brodersen et al. 2008). This observation suggests the possibility that imperfect pairing between the amiR159-HCPro and mutated targets might lead to translational repression rather than to viral RNA cleavage. In contrast to the catalytic effect of amiR-mediated viral RNA cleavage, translational repression requires stoichiometric amounts of amiRs and, therefore, is not as efficient as antiviral mechanism that may allow for residual viral replication.",

Another remarkable difference is that although in the L20.Col-0 lineage the frequency of haplotypes containing putative escape mutations was in the range 0.0001\u20130.001, in the three lineages evolved in 10-4 plants, this frequency fluctuated between 0.001 and 0.01, \u223c10-fold higher, an observation that is consistent with the hypothesis that in these partially resistant plants escape mutations confer a fitness advantage to the viral genotypes bearing them (Lafforgue et al. 2011).\n",

This can be interpreted as indicating that no site is particularly variable or conserved, but only in the context of interaction with passage (F20,126 = 3.067, P < 0.001) and in the three-way interaction (F40,126 = 3.414, P < 0.001), meaning that in some particular passages and lineages, certain sites are more polymorphic than others.

For example, we can hypothesize that if the amiR159-HCPro target is what drives the evolutionary transition from sensitivity to the resistance observed in the last passage of figures 2A and 3A\u2013C, then variation outside the target would not be the object of selection and thus would simply reflect the mutation\u2013selection balance. In the case of lineage L20.Col-0, the ancestral sequence was preserved along the entire evolution experiment, with its frequency oscillating in the narrow range 99.07\u201399.62% (median value 99.50%). Only three other haplotypes remained in all the passages, with frequencies in the range 0.02\u20130.04%. Looking at the per site variability, all sites showed variation, but it was lower than 0.4% for all sites and passages (median 0.02%). A similar situation was found in the three lineages evolved in the partially resistant 10-4 plants. For lineage L1.10-4, the ancestral TuMV haplotype had a median frequency across the three passages of 99.36%, with an average frequency of variants per site of \u223c0.02%.

Finally, the ancestral sequence also dominated all passages of lineage L11.10-4 (99.42% on median), and the average variation per site was equivalent to that observed in the other lineages (\u223c0.02%).",

In this previous study, we showed the emergence of escape alleles containing mutations in the target that are likely to affect the binding of the amiR and consequently slicing by RISC. Now, we have characterized the molecular evolutionary dynamics of TuMV populations evolving either in a fully susceptible or in a partially resistant host. Using Illumina ultradeep sequencing, we have reached an unprecedented detection limit, allowing us to detect variants in the viral populations at a frequency as low as 2 \u00d7 10\u22126. We have shown that variation in the amiR159-HCPro target was generated and maintained along evolutionary time and that every nucleotide in the target sequence underwent mutation. In fully susceptible plants, new variants emerged to frequencies below 0.001. Some variants persisted for several passages, whereas others had a transient existence. The escape variant that finally succeeded in infecting fully resistant 12-4 plants was present in the evolving population from the very beginning of the evolution experiment. These results are compatible with a mutation\u2013drift model (substantiated by significant, negative Tajima\u2019s D). TuMV populations evolving in partially resistant plants showed a qualitatively similar behavior although with a quantitatively important difference: the frequency of escape variants in the evolving populations was more than one order of magnitude higher in partially resistant than in fully susceptible plants. These results are compatible with a mutation\u2013selection\u2013drift model of evolution and explain why resistance was broken much more easily in the former case. In both cases, the selective fixation of variants was due to changes in the nucleotide sequences and not by changes in the amino acid composition of the HC-Pro, as the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were equivalent.",

At the final positive pathogenicity test passages (3, 4, and 5), we show the haplotypic composition (shadow in light green). (D\u2013F) Observed diversity per each of the 21 nt in the amiR target at each passage. Panels (A and D) correspond to lineage L1.10-4, panels (B and E) to lineage L10.10-4, and panels (C and F) to lineage L11.10-4. Diversity at the last indicated passage corresponds to that observed in the population that broke the 12-4 resistance (shadow in light green). Abscises axes are in decimal log scale.",
