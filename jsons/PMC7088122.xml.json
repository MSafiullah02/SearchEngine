The social and economic impact of viral respiratory disease is substantial, due to hospitalizations, medical costs, missed work, and school and day care absences. For instance, estimates show that viral respiratory tract illnesses (mostly common colds) cost US$40 billion annually in the United States alone [1].",

            "text": "There are over 200 different types of viruses which cause RTIs in humans. Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are the largest group of respiratory viruses, comprising over 150 serotypes [2]. In humans, the predominant illness caused by HRV is the acute upper RTI, also known as the common cold. The second most common viruses infecting humans are the human enteroviruses (HEV), which are associated with clinical manifestations ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to serious conditions [2]. Influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenoviruses are also major causative agents of both upper and lower RTIs [3\u20135]. In addition, many other viruses or virus groups cause RTIs, e.g., parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses can cause a broad spectrum of respiratory diseases, ranging from mild upper RTIs to pneumonia [6]. In recent years, with the rapid development of high-throughput molecular techniques, several new viruses associated with respiratory diseases, such as human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, and the new coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63, have been identified as well [7].",

Currently, the only effective antivirals and vaccines for the prevention and treatment of respiratory virus infections are available against influenza viruses and adenoviruses. For the viruses causing common cold (HRV, HEV), no effective therapies are available. Large varieties of etiologic agents and increasing antibiotic and antiviral resistance challenge the development of efficient therapies. Consequently, it is of importance to find alternative and safe ways to reduce the risk of these infections. Even partially effective therapy in the treatment and prevention of viral RTIs such as the common cold could have an impact on reducing morbidity and economic losses due to this illness.",

The most common types of microbes used as probiotics are lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, which are generally consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurts or dietary supplements. Criteria for probiotic bacteria include that the bacterial strain: (1) must be able to survive in the gastrointestinal tract and to proliferate in the gut; (2) should exert benefits to the host through growth and/or activity in the human body; (3) should be non-pathogenic and non-toxic; (4) provide protection against pathogenic microorganisms by means of multiple mechanisms; and (5) should be lacking transferable antibiotic resistance [9]. Different bacterial strains of the same genus and species, verified also by genomic information, may exert completely different effects on the host.",

Probiotics are likely to have an impact through gut mucosa by balancing the local microbiota by inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms [12], and by enhancing local and systemic immune responses [13]. They may also influence the composition and activity of microbiota in the intestinal contents. Considering the beneficial effects of probiotics in virus infections, specific probiotics have been suggested to be effective in alleviating the duration and severity of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis [14]. In addition, increasing evidence shows that probiotics are beneficial in RTIs [15], which, in most cases, are of viral origin. However, the mechanisms behind these effects are largely unknown.",

In another study, no differences were reported between the L. rhamnosus GG and the control groups in the number of antibiotic treatments or respiratory symptom episodes [47]. However, in a subgroup with L. rhamnosus GG identification in feces, L. rhamnosus GG usage reduced the duration of RTIs. In hospitalized children, L. rhamnosus GG reduced the risk of RTIs and duration of RTI episodes [42]. In preterm infants, L. rhamnosus GG reduced the incidence of RTIs [46]. In addition, a meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials investigating the role of L. rhamnosus GG in the prevention of respiratory infections in children showed that L. rhamnosus GG has the potential to reduce the risk of upper RTIs, incidence of acute otitis media, and antibiotic use. There were no significant differences between the L. rhamnosus GG and the control groups in the incidence of lower RTIs [48].",

A variety of probiotic strains have been used in these clinical trials, most of them belonging to the genus Lactobacillus. In addition, various combinations of probiotics have been used. Of 33 studies, altogether, 28 studies reported that probiotics had beneficial effects in the outcome of RTIs and five showed no clear benefit. Only eight studies, however, reported investigating the viral etiology. Of these, only one study showed a statistically significant reduction in the virus load in the probiotic group. A Cochrane systematic review by Hao et al. concluded that probiotics were better than placebo in terms of reducing the number of upper RTI episodes, the incidence of acute upper RTI episodes, and antibiotics used [15]. Although clinical trials show that the use of specific probiotics and probiotic combinations are beneficial in RTIs, there are also studies that report no clear advantage. In addition, several viruses can cause respiratory illnesses, but only a few studies have investigated probiotics\u2019 effectiveness on viral agents. The lack of consistent evidence between probiotic strains/genera and even within strains may be due to variation in study designs and reported outcome measures, the length of intervention, study populations used (children vs. adults) or bacterial doses (106\u20131010 cfu), and matrices (milk, yoghurt, capsule) used. In addition, in the elderly, decreased immunity due to aging may partly explain the conflicting results [79].\n",

Virus attachment to a host cell is the first essential step in the disease process, and, therefore, interruption of this attachment could be beneficial to the host. Probiotic bacteria may bind directly to the virus and inhibit virus attachment to the host cell receptor. For instance, there is evidence that specific strains of lactobacilli are able to bind and inactivate vesicular stomatitis virus (flu-like virus) in vitro [81]. Probiotics may also show direct antimicrobial activity against pathogens by producing antimicrobial substances such as organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, biosurfactants, and bacteriocins [12]. In experimental studies in epithelial cells and macrophages, metabolic products of specific lactobacilli and bifidobacteria prevented vesicular stomatitis virus infection in a strain-specific manner [81]. In addition, metabolites of bacteria in yoghurts showed antiviral activity, inhibiting influenza virus replication [82]. The induction of low-level synthesis of nitric oxide may also be involved in the protective actions of probiotics against viruses in the respiratory cells, as shown in alveolar macrophages in vitro [27, 83, 84]. However, it should be noted that respiratory viruses infect cells with different mechanisms by using various receptors and, also, the antiviral effects of probiotics are strain-specific.",

Probiotics may mediate their antiviral effects against respiratory viruses possibly by eliciting systemic immune responses via gut or enhancing cellular immunity in the airways with increased activity of natural killer cells and macrophages. In the gut epithelial cells and/or antigen-presenting cells, probiotics are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) [85\u201388]. Probiotics may, therefore, modulate cytokine expression patterns through epithelial cells [89] and through underlying professional antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells [90\u201395].",

In murine DCs, L. acidophilus NCFM and L. acidophilus X37 induced the expression of viral defense genes (IFN-\u03b2, IL-12, IL-10) [96]. In human macrophages, L. rhamnosus Lc705 induced type I interferon-dependent gene activation, which correlated with the prevention of influenza A virus replication and the production of viral proteins [97]. In influenza infection in mice, orally administered probiotic product containing Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus regulated the TRL7 signaling pathway [34] and L. pentosus b240 regulated antiviral gene expression against the infection [31]. In addition, orally ingested probiotics strains of Lactobacillus [17, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28, 32] and Bifidobacterium [33] have enhanced cytokine production in the lungs or serum against viruses. There is also evidence that intranasally administrated probiotics protect against respiratory virus infection in mice by stimulating innate immune responses directly in the respiratory epithelium [20, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 35\u201337, 98]. Additionally, sublingual administration of L. rhamnosus protected against influenza virus infection by enhancing mucosal secretory IgA production, T and NK cell activity, and lung IL-12 levels [25].

In addition, studies in healthy human subjects suggest that specific probiotics may enhance the immunogenicity of viral vaccines. L. rhamnosus GG was effective in inducing protective immune response against the H3N2 strain in influenza virus vaccine [99]. Moreover, L. fermentum CECT5716 ingestion in adults resulted in lower influenza-like illness, increased proportion of NK cells in blood, significantly higher TNF-\u03b1, and increased anti-influenza-specific IgA and IgM after influenza vaccination [61]. The consumption of B. animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 or L. paracasei ssp. paracasei L. casei 431431 also showed significantly greater increase in influenza virus vaccine-specific IgG antibodies in plasma and secretory IgA in saliva [100]. In the elderly, the consumption of fermented yoghurt with L. casei DN-114 001 increased significantly influenza-specific antibody titers after influenza vaccination, especially against influenza B virus [101]. These studies suggest that orally ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria have an adjuvant-like effect on the humoral responses.",

However, probiotic therapy has raised potential safety concerns, including systemic infections, toxic or metabolic effects on the gastrointestinal tract, and the transfer of antibiotic resistance in the gastrointestinal microbiota [103]. In rare cases, some studies have reported Lactobacillus septicemia in children [104], in immunocompromised subjects [105], and detrimental effects in subjects with hepatitis [106]. However, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded that there are no specific safety concerns regarding Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or Propionibacterium strains, as they have a long history of safe use in food [107]. In addition, for instance in Finland, increased consumption of probiotic products containing L. rhamnosus GG has not resulted in a significant increase in Lactobacillus bacteremia [108] and L. rhamnosus GG consumption is regarded as safe in immunocompromised human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients [108]. It should be taken into consideration that the safety of probiotics has not been as systematically investigated as in drugs, and the safety evaluation is partly based on long-term experience.",

In addition, possible antiviral mechanisms of probiotics in respiratory virus infections were discussed. Probiotic therapy may offer an interesting alternative in the alleviation or prevention of viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs), which cause a significant health and economic burden to humans. Based on this review, clinical trials in human subjects show promising data demonstrating that specific probiotics are able to shorten the duration or reduce the risk of respiratory infections. However, only a few clinical studies have actually investigated the effects of probiotics on specific viruses, which are the most common agents causing RTIs. Thus, more clinical research should be targeted to revealing which probiotics or their combinations would be the most effective ones against RTI viruses.",
