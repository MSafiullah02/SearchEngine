Another area of concern is that approximately 48% of the patients who were sputum negative had a diagnosis of COVID19 confirmed by CT scan, which seems to have a better diagnostic yield than sputum RT-PCR. A third point of concern is the absence of cough and hence productive cough in the early as well as in the convalescent period. Hence, screening with sputum might become a challenge in these situations. A recent report from China recommends RT-PCR testing on induced sputum samples (induced with 10 ml of 3% normal saline inhaled through a mask with oxygen flowing at 6L/min for a duration of 20 minutes or until induction of cough) [6] . Sample collection in the form of sputum or induced sputum was found to have a better yield as well as was deemed safer for the health-care workers compared to obtaining throat or nasal swabs. However, the logistics and patient discomfort associated with sputum induction remains a very big challenge especially for large scale screening purpose. In such a scenario obtaining a throat or nasal swab along with thermal screening could be a better alternative.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 811, "end": 814, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dear Sir,"}, {"text": "In view of the significant increase in the probability of case detection, we suggest complementing the thermal scan screening technique with the rapid sputum testing with RT-PCR method, in addition to fortifying the holding area with masks, hand washing facilities, appropriate gears for health-care personnel as well as paramedical staff, isolated demarcated area for selective testing and transport facilities.
