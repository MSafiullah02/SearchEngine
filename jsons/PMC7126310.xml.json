A decision was made at the onset that the immediate focus would not be on program governance, (infra)structure, or developing an entirely \u201cnew palliative program,\u201d but rather, on optimizing existing clinical services, resources, and funding through the development and implementation of a quality improvement project, the Palliative Care Integration Project (PCIP). The PCIP would serve as the basis for the development of more integrated clinical relationships, and thus efficient and effective client care. The intention was that the PCIP \u201cproject\u201d format would eventually transition to a \u201cprogram\u201d and expand into surrounding regions in Southeastern Ontario.",

There were nearly 100 individuals from over 30 different organizations who actively participated in bringing it to fruition. Although we cannot say that all outcomes are attributable to the project alone, the evaluation of administrative data showed that across the three-year study period, there was evidence of improvement in efficiencies in patient care, for example, a consistent decrease in the length of stay, reduced visits to the Emergency Department, and an increase in home or non-acute care facility deaths. In addition, there were improvements in patient symptom intensity, although these were not statistically significant.6\n",

A project of this magnitude, involving multiple sites, disciplines, and geography, required open communication, objectives (short, interim, and long term), and a strong commitment to continuous collaboration and quality improvement.

When the project was evaluated, the processes regarding documentation within and between sites of care had not been addressed. This meant that some of the outcomes were not captured. The relatively low participation in focus group discussions and completion of surveys might reflect fatigue with the project or the priorities of frontline health care professionals. With this in mind, the results might reflect some bias.",
