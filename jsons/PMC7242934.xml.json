As the logistical channels that bring goods and services to consumers are strategically enchanted, an additional method of establishing value in distribution channels is established. We contextualize this process by considering factors that drive the perceived value of goods and services within channels of distribution. Beyond the contributions of traditional value chains to products, differing modes of distribution may contribute independently to the perceived value of products, thus allowing and even requiring a broad view of the value acquisition process in distribution\u2014a view that may include the enchantment of distribution channels. In their presentation of a service-dominant logic of marketing, Lusch and his associates (c.f [[27], [48], [28]]. have used an ecological metaphor to conceptualize ways that various stakeholders interact as they exchange goods and services. So, for example, associated with each product will be a network of customers, dealers, original equipment manufacturers, and tiers of suppliers interacting with each other in a dynamic exchange ecology. Moreover, the advent of the Internet has reshaped value networks so that economic advantages previously held by certain stakeholders have been moved to others within the networks (c.f [14]. Logistics services\u2014traditionally the operational processes that enable transactions between those who supply goods and services and their customers\u2014become an integral part of the marketing process and are subsumed under such value networks.",

Efficiency refers to an organization's management of costs\u2014efficient organizations offer services at costs that are acceptable to customers. Effective logistics require the successful positioning of products and services. Customers who enjoy effective logistical operations are presented with a variety of purchase opportunities that are conveniently available. Short fulfillment times for orders, in-stock availability of products, and high-quality retail service are all examples of ways that logistics can be effective. Finally, in contrast to overall costs (efficiency) and the positioning of products (effectiveness), relevant logistics (sometimes called differentiated logistics) are distribution services that are designed around the ways customers work and live. Organizations using relevant logistics solicit information about specific customer needs and then develop solutions based on those identified needs. For example, when an integrated service provider customizes a mass mailing to meet a customer's specific scheduling requirements, when a manufacturer integrates a particular array of electronic features into a product in order to achieve the functionality a customer requires, or even when a particular fabric is selected for an article of clothing so that it will be fashionable, the logistics involved create value because the service rendered is relevant to customers. It is necessary to develop ongoing relationships with customers to address their needs and requirements [7].",

An additional way that distribution channels may become relevant is through the process of enchantment that engages consumers in what has traditionally been a mundane facet of the consumption process. Beyond gathering information to increase the desirability of product offerings, enchantment creates logistical relevance by operating on the physical and social transition points between organizations and customers, making these points of transition intriguing and enticing.",

In his analysis, pre-modern life was mediated by magic and mystery; the advent of modernity led to systematic increases in formal rationality, supplanting a mystical, enchanted worldview and evolving into a more systematically organized secular society. Campbell [16] provides an alternative analysis that admits a re-enchantment of rationalized systems of consumption motivated by self-illusory hedonism. According to Campbell, we consume goods not simply for utilitarian reasons but also to fulfill our consumerist daydreams\u2014yearnings that make the process of consuming an enchanting experience. When reality fails to measure up to our daydreams, we are disappointed but inevitably re-enter the market in further search of satisfaction. The cycle repeats itself endlessly as our needs to re-experience yearning generate new desires.",

More recently, post-modern thinkers have seen the processes of disenchantment and re-enchantment as sociohistoric constructions that are in a process of continual \u201cfruitful tension\u201d [17]; p. 700) where combinations of rationalizing and enchanting elements are present simultaneously.",

Such farms typically sell produce by subscription in a commune format\u2014delivering some rather arbitrary selection of organic produce (what is ripe in a particular week) to local consumers on a weekly basis. By participating in community-supported agriculture, consumers eat local and thereby re-territorialize their food. According to this formulation, enchantment is strongly tied to place as consumers see themselves as making environmentally supportive and ethically correct choices. Through sympathetic magical connections contact is forged with the \u201cland\u201d and the life-giving forces it represents while at the same time rejecting the values and ideology associated with industrialized agribusiness.",

In the first, we look at Target Inc., a large brick and mortar discount chain. Although Target has made a strong commitment to its e-commerce business, the retailer still sold only 4.4% of its goods via a digital channel in 2017 [29] and so must primarily be considered a brick and mortar retailer. The store has also done little to involve customers in its value network, relying instead on traditional marketing approaches. Nonetheless, Target has been successful in attracting customers with designer collaborations and we describe their use of digital technology as a way to engage customers by identifying clothing that they prefer. Second, we examine enchantment at Amazon as an example of how enchantment can take place in a value network that is almost exclusively digital [27]. Finally, we turn to Koji BBQ, a hybrid organization that, like Target, distributes its products in face-to-face interactions, but like Amazon, uses digital technology as an integral part of its logistics. These differing cases allow us to identify characteristics of digital enchantment that may be applied in organizations that function in a variety of value networks.",

A large percentage of the goods sold match the price of other discount chains. However, Target also offers upscale merchandise sold at higher price points [30] and not carried by other discounters. Target's intent is to lure steady customers into the store with an assortment of rotating unique items\u2014constantly surprising consumers with their merchandise [31]. As a way of accenting the upscale merchandise, at the end of the 1990's target began linking with established designers (e.g. Michael Graves, Isaac Mizrahi) to design lines of consumer products ranging from appliances to linens to apparel [32]. The designer cachet has served Target well, further differentiating the upscale end of their product mix from competitors while using their manufacturing power to assure designer level quality [33]. In 2008 Target and Mizrahi parted ways, and the company launched a new series of design collaborations. So that Target could achieve its goal of product rotation, these collaborations were intended to be limited in time. For example, in 2009 Target partnered with designer Alexander McQueen to produce the McQ Alexander McQueen for Target collection [34]. Overall, Target has presented collaborations with 150 designers [35] with varying levels of success. Although sales from the designer collections have contributed only a fraction to Target's bottom line, the interest and consumer excitement generated by the constantly rotating and potentially surprising designer merchandise has created a level of enchantment at a discount chain that would normally be found only at much smaller and more exclusive sellers.",

The basis for their choices in this collection was, of course, their taste, but also digitally collected feedback from Target customers and the Who What Wear website with over two million Twitter followers [36]. In announcing the design collaboration, Katherine Power stated, \u201cWe've kind of taken our expertise as fashion editors and combined it with what our audience truly wants. We're gonna be tapping into, you know, all of the Target guests and all of our social media followers\u201d [37]. As a result, the collection was produced in part by customers. Under such circumstances, the cynicism that accompanies re-enchantment may well be tempered by customer participation\u2014in the case of Target by customers who recognize their own tastes in the Who What Wear collection.",

On the one hand, the recommendation algorithm is positioned as a solution to help access desirable content and products amid the nearly infinite variety available through \u2018The Everything Store\u2019 [40]. Algorithms that Amazon employs are therefore thought to impact customer purchasing behavior directly. While this may be the case, we also claim that the algorithm operates at a discursive level to position the audience\u2014a process we label the \u2018algorithmic audience.\u2019 Specifically, the audience is positioned by Amazon's discursive claims to assume that the results delivered by recommendation engines (algorithms) are simply delivering to customers what they have already told the algorithm they want to consume. Because of this particular positioning, customers are especially open to the digitally generated and presented suggestions provided by the algorithm and come to view the system as their personal curator. The purpose of these recommendations according to Amazon itself is to \u201cdelight our customers by allowing them to serendipitously discover great products\u201d [41]. Customers cast into the position of being an algorithmic audience experience a degree of enchantment because of the personal relevance of the recommendations presented to them. As a member of an algorithmic audience, customers recognize a connection with other, similar individuals. This connection is extended to validate an association with various subcultures [42], taste cultures [43], or lifestyles [44]. Such personal validation is desirable and given that recommendations are always instantly available, are both intriguing and rewarding to customers. Notice that it is the consumption practice that is desired and that this is over and above the value that is provided by any specific product. As a result, the recommendation process itself is engaging and enchanting\u2014beyond the utility provided by particular products.",

Kogi has gone from one truck to many trucks, and has also developed a stationary sit-down restaurant. Awards have come pouring in, along with plenty of media coverage as Kogi has been reported in many major newspapers from the Los Angeles Times to the New York Times, even being listed as one of Jonathan Gold's 99 top LA eating experiences. Kogi's use of new mediated technology and multiple social media platforms have effectively bridged the gulf between the producer and consumer.

Cialdini [47] has identified this as the scarcity heuristic\u2014a judgment shortcut where evaluations of quantity and availability are used to assess the value of an object or experience. By this criterion, things that are scarce are seen as more valuable. Cialdini theorized that the scarcity heuristic operates because of psychological reactance, a negative drive state created by perceived restrictions of freedom or choice [48]. Things that we perceive as scarce come to be perceived as more valuable because not possessing the item is seen as a threat to our freedom. The scarcity heuristic applies to both merchandise and the situational contexts within which the merchandise is distributed. Applied to our case studies, the realization by customers that only a limited amount of merchandise is manufactured for each of Target's WhoWhatWear seasons drives demand both in terms of the availability of the merchandise and the amount of time it is available. Both the time and availability conditions restrict choice and potentially create reactance if customers don't buy promptly. To combat such potential restrictions of freedom, customers seek to obtain the scarce merchandise and in addition seek to enjoy the experience of enchantment that accompanies the merchandise. It is critical to note that if the merchandise is sold out, satisfactions from both the item and the enchanted context within which it once was available will be missing.

For example, Kogi BBQ's minimal advertising budget forced them to rely on the free Twitter platform to alert customers about their often-changing locations. The social media platform meshed with their physical taco truck to create complementary platforms that together were significantly more impactful than the sum of the two considered separately. In the same way, Amazon's expanding physical bookstore chain [49] features books that have been selected based on online customer responses. For example, the in-store cookbook display features only cookbooks that have been rated online as four-star books or higher. The same is true with a variety of other displays. Customers in the physical bookstore are reassured that they are viewing quality, popular books because of the meshing of Amazon's online rating system with the viewing and touching of the physical books. In addition, Amazon Prime customers (a $99.00 per year premium digital membership that features free shipping) receive discounted prices at Amazon physical bookstores. Experiencing multiple interacting platforms lends to an enchanted, transmediated purchasing environment.",

            "text": "Both Ritzer, (2005) and Thompson and Coskuner-balli [18] see enchantment in opposition to the rationalization of business processes. Returning to Campbell [16]; we consume goods not simply for utilitarian reasons but to also fulfill our consumerist fantasies\u2014consumption daydreams that make the process of consuming an enchanting experience. Campbell asserts that our experience will never live up to our fantasies so that although enchantment is a potentially powerful corrective to the rationalization of consumption, it will always fall short. In addition, as Thompson and Coskuner-balli [18] point out, re-enchantment serves as an ideological veil that obscures the reality that enchantment itself has become rationalized (Ritzer, 2005). Although a number of the examples presented in this paper support such a conclusion, it is also possible to view re-enchantment within the value networks that a service-dominated logic approach prescribes [11]. The digital consumption experiences in our case studies make it easy for suppliers to intentionally involve their customers in perfecting and presenting their services so that the goal of relevant logistics can be realized. For example, in Targets's WhoWhatWear designer collaboration, the basis for the choices in this collection was, of course, the design curator's taste, but feedback from Target customers and the Who What Wear website with over two million Twitter followers [36] was also a significant part of the selection criteria. The collection was produced in part by customers. Under such circumstances, the cynicism that accompanies re-enchantment may well be tempered by customer participation\u2014in the case of Target by customers who recognize their own tastes in the Who What Wear collection. It is important to point out that such customer participation would be impossible without a digital communication channel that allows for customer feedback.",

Customers are therefore intimately involved in the production of the \u2018treasure hunt\u2019 that is integral to the Kogi experience. The company tweets location information, but it is then the choice and responsibility of the customer to commit to the cruise for food. The customer choice and commitment associated with going on the hunt for Kogi tacos is in opposition to a calculated maneuver on the part of the seller and can be seen as a corrective to corporate manipulations. Kogi can be representative of larger cultural shifts and trends. It is a Korean and Latin fusion cooking driven by new mediated technologies and platforms that allow for increased sharing and participating. Kogi's networked ecology would be impossible without the digital linkages the company cultivated as we move further into the hybridity and diversity of a networked, enchanted world.",

Rather, a conceptualization of logistics as part of loosely coupled value networks that subsume traditional value and distribution chains suggest that integrating customer participation is essential to provide a complete account of logistical processes. Digital shopping experiences make entry and continued participation in these value networks easy and convenient; and in the case of social distancing, necessary. Our case studies support the view that customers can be enchanted by using ubiquitous digital devices and platforms. As a result, enchantment may be co-produced digitally in cooperation with customers, suggesting that enchanting logistics may not entirely be due to the strict calculations of corporations. As corporations seek to provide logistical solutions that are relevant to customers, digital enchantment becomes a tool that allows for differentiation from competitors and increasing levels of fit between products and consumers.",
