Marginalized in the best of times, the millions of people experiencing homelessness, struggling with substance use disorder, or incarcerated must not be left out. As in prior epidemics, these populations will pay the greatest price. Viewed through the lens of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related treaties, all humans deserve medical care, necessary social services, and security of livelihood in situations out of one's control.1 A similar conclusion will be arrived at on pragmatic public health grounds if the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve is to be \u201cflattened.\u201d Social distancing may either be physically infeasible or else unlikely to be meticulously adhered to. Every group represents a potential reservoir of infection that could infect others. Yet, even with awareness that all individuals deserve access to services, and that supporting marginalized populations will slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, resource limitations will demand difficult allocation determinations. The governmental, medical, and public health responses will dictate whether existing health inequities are worsened during the pandemic. Containing the pandemic requires a vigorous attempt to redress the needs of the voiceless. Failure to do so is not an option.",

Amid this pandemic, shelters are reducing staffing and clientele while experiencing increasing demand for services. Consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptom screening protocols are being implemented to identify individuals with fever or respiratory illness,2 and although facilities strive to isolate symptomatic individuals, they are often unable to do so owing to space limitations. The long incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and the heterogeneous clinical presentation may render symptom screening to be a limited tool, especially given that individuals may be asymptomatic with SARS-CoV-2. Preliminary reports from post-exposure testing at a homeless shelter in Boston found a 36% case rate of SARS-CoV-2 from their cohort of 408 clients who received the polymerase chain reaction test, but only a small percentage had cough (7.5%), shortness of breath (1.4%), or fever (0.7%).3 New research suggests the estimated cumulative frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases among adults experiencing homelessness in Boston was 46.3 cases per 1,000 compared with 1.9 cases per 1,000 adults in Massachusetts over the same 15-day period.4 Without access to universal polymerase chain reaction testing for all individuals entering shelters, and an ability to safely isolate individuals who are positive, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely to continue and cities should prepare for the possibility of increased burden of disease among populations experiencing homelessness.",

The SARS-CoV-2 response must prioritize access to testing in congregate settings and ensure access to shelters that can follow isolation and quarantine recommendations. Local coordination of shelter services will be required to ensure that both asymptomatic individuals without COVID-19 and those who are exposed or diagnosed with COVID-19 have safe places to quarantine and isolate. In most localities, this will require identification of new facilities; examples of such facilities could include hotels, dormitories, and closed public buildings.",

During the H1N1 pandemic of 2009\u20132010, an Australian correctional facility reported effective containment of the virus through limiting visitors to the facility and implementing symptom screenings, isolating cases, and quarantining contacts.5 Although most U.S. jails and prisons have already implemented such measures, the longer incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, higher baseline prevalence in many communities, and ongoing staff movement into and out of the facility makes it unlikely the virus will stay out.

If it is unavoidable, then accommodations should be made to prevent transmission to the higher-risk individuals.6 At the time of this report, at least one correctional facility (J Clarke, RI DOC, personal communication, 2020) has separated individuals at risk for severe disease from others as much as possible, yet the efficacy of this practice is still unclear. In addition to the measures taken inside correctional facilities, authorities must move quickly to reassess security and public health risks. Release of individuals who do not pose an immediate threat to public safety while reducing arrests and delaying sentencing is prudent. Individuals who are being held in jails because of their inability to afford bail, or for minor infractions or violations, should be released with support to ensure safe shelter. Similarly, those eligible for parole can and should be released. Already, it has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in correctional settings spread quickly, with reports from Cook County Jail in Illinois going from two positive cases to more than 350 confirmed positive cases in slightly more than 2 weeks.7 The U.S., which has the highest worldwide incarceration rate, and a disproportionally greater minority and disadvantaged population, must act swiftly to protect the health and safety of incarcerated individuals and the community at large.",

Experiences from disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy have taught that illicit drug market disruptions place people who use drugs at risk for supply discontinuity, paraphernalia shortage, and social disconnection.8\n,\n9 This will happen now. Furthermore, shutdowns will disrupt the ability to generate income to support their use. The result will be decreased use, loss of tolerance, and risk for overdose. Sharing or reusing scarce syringes will increase infectious diseases. Individuals who use opioids may be more interested in initiating medication for opioid use disorder. However, the treatments with the strongest evidence\u2014methadone and buprenorphine\u2014are not readily accessible in many parts of the country.10 One million individuals with opioid use disorder did not have access to medication for opioid use disorder in 2012.11 In response to SARS-CoV-2, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has developed emergency regulations to support medication for opioid use disorder via telehealth,12 and temporarily waived the requirement for in-person physical exam to be able to initiate buprenorphine. To increase access further, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 waiver should be suspended to allow any prescriber with a Drug Enforcement Administration license to prescribe buprenorphine. At a minimum, patient limits should be removed that would allow existing buprenorphine prescribers to take on more new patients.",
