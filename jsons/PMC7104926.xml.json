            "text": "Currently, most commercially available devices are based on LFI. The assays are conducted on paper, nitrocellulose or plastic supports. The analyte migrates up the support by capillarity, along with the appropriately-conjugated antibodies, up to a test zone where another antibody immobilizes the complex. A second antibody binds to the analyte, which is then sandwiched between the 2 antibodies. The conjugated antibody that did not initially bind to the analyte continues migrating up to a third antibody that binds it within a control zone. To detect the complex that is formed with the analytes, the first antibody is usually bound to markers such as colloidal gold particles, colored latex, or selenium, depending on the kind of detector used. As a result, qualitative or quantitative measures are typically obtained within 15 min.",

However, even with the high sensitivity and specificity of PCR-based methods, they have drawbacks such as the dependence on a thermocycler, which can increase the cost and complexity of miniaturized portable devices. As a result, different strategies have been proposed to amplify samples without using a thermocycler. One of these strategies is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of DNA.50 This technique relies on strand displacement by a DNA polymerase and on the appropriate design of primers (4 primers that can bind in 6 distinct sequences) to amplify target sequences at a constant temperature (\u223c60\u00b0C) with high selectivity. Based on this principle, Bearinger et al51 developed a prototype of a small device capable of analyzing swab-collected samples in \u223c90 min. They could detect \u223c17 copies of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) genomic DNA and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) from an epithelial homogenate in100 \u03bcL of reaction volume. They used a simple colorimetric detection system based on the detection of free Mg+2. The method is based on the principle that the concentration of this ion diminishes as it binds to the pyrophosphate that is released in the amplification reaction. The versatility of this method also permits applications that use reverse transcription.52\n",

            "text": "There are some specific methods for the detection of nucleic acids that deserve a separate mention due to their originality. One of these methods involves the use of heat shock proteins (HSP). More specifically, Javier et al57 developed this strategy to detect mRNA targets derived from Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts using oligonucleotide-gold nanoparticles. By incubating the oocysts at 42\u00b0C for 20 min, they induced the synthesis of the mRNA for HSPs and they purified them with magnetic beads that were coupled with oligo-dT. They detected the mRNA for HSP70 using gold nanoparticles coupled with oligonucleotides specific to their target mRNA. These gold nanoparticles facilitate the formation of aggregates in the presence of the target mRNA, and they can be detected by simple colorimetric changes in to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This detection method is based on the distortion that adsorbed analytes produce on measurable electron oscillations on the surface of the gold particle, and it is common among lab-on-a-chip microdetection devices. The use of HSP mRNA is a clever way of achieving nucleic acid amplification with low material requirements. However, oocysts need to be alive so that they can respond to the heat shock, a factor that must be taken into account for future applications and extensions of this method.",

Since its introduction in 1996 as a method for the analysis of nucleic acids,59 nanopore technology has experienced substantial progress to the point where it is currently possible to obtain sequence information on single nucleic acid molecules60 as well as on complexes formed by nucleic acids and proteins.60, 61, 62, 63 These analyses are based on the principle that nucleic acids go through nanoscopic pores by electrophoresis. The dimensions of these pores are such that when nucleic acids go through, they cover most of the pore area. The aqueous buffer in which the pore is immersed contains ions that produce a measurable electric current. When the nucleic acids traverse the pore, a blockade in the current can be detected and, on average, this blockade has different properties depending on the specific characteristics (including base sequence) of the analyte that is going through. Nucleic acids are driven to the pore by the electric voltage as soon as they are added to the detection solution and the measurements can be carried out within 5 min for a single nucleic acid sample. Given these properties, it is likely that this technology can be used for sequencing applications in the near future.",
