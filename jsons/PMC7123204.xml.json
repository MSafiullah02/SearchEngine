Discovered in 1974 by researchers studying viral hepatitis (Cossart et al. 1975), parvoviruses are important human and animal pathogens. The virus, an Erythrovirus propagates best within erythroid progenitor cells (Brown et al. 1993). In humans, the cellular receptor P antigen for parvovirus B19s may cause erythema infectiosum, an entity also called \u201cfifth disease\u201d (recognized in 1889 and named in 1899). Its name given to it historically as the fifth disease, after measles, rubella, varicella, and scarlet fever of the classical childhood skin rashes or exanthems in children (David 1982; Plummer et al. 1985; Brown et al. 1993).",

PV can cause serious illnesses including pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, major joint arthritis, life-threatening transient aplastic crisis especially in patients with underlying sickle cell disease, and hemolytic disease such as chronic red cell aplasia in immunocompromised patients (Smith-Whitley et al. 2004). It may also cause early fetal death or hydrops fetalis and unrecognized viral myocarditis (Young and Brown 2004). Lung involvement is uncommon but has been reported to occur in children with fatal multiorgan failure (Ferraz 2005). Pleuropneumonitis due to PV can be seen in immunocompromised adults with heart-lung transplants (Janner et al. 1994; Castagna et al. 2011) but may also be seen in sporadic non-immunocompromised patients (Wardeh and Marik 1998; Morris and Smilack 1998). The multiplicity of clinical presentations of the infection can masquerade as other disorders, in all ages resulting in misdiagnosis and possible overtreatment.",

            "text": "Infection by PV occurs worldwide with similar infectivity rates in the USA, Europe, and Asia (Norja et al. 2008). By age of 15 years, over 50 % of adolescents have antibodies from previous childhood infection (Young and Brown 2004). The number of people infected over adulthood increases so that the majority of elderly individuals are seropositive (Kerr 1996). Studies of fifth disease outbreaks in the UK have shown that many children, and adults had evidence of PV antibodies but not the symptoms of the disease (Anderson et al. 1983). In temperate climates, infections peak in late winter or early spring with sporadic small epidemics (Cohen and Buckley 1988). PV B19 spreads through respiratory droplets and is highly contagious (Anderson et al. 1985). Household transmission is >50 % and 20\u201330 % for teachers and day-care providers. As it lacks a lipid envelope and has high genomic stability, the PV is difficult to kill and is resistant to heat and solvent detergents (Kaufmann et al. 2004). PV infection has been reported as a nosocomial infection with transmission via blood products (especially pooled factors VIII and IX) and in health-care workers from patients and contaminated specimens (Kooistra et al. 2011) (Seng et al. 1994) (Siegl and Cassinotti 1998). PV is transmitted vertically from infected mothers to fetuses with a 30 % risk of transplacental transmission. PVB19 is the predominant pathogen and is the prototype strain for genotype 1 (Failey et al. 1995; Jordan et al. 2001). Less common, recently discovered erythroviruses (genotypes 2 and 3) are increasing and spreading. Genotypes 1 and 2 are typically present in Western countries (the USA and Europe) and genotype 3 in sub-Saharan Africa and South America (Freitas et al. 2008).",

After several days, some patients (up to 25 %) develop a red rash on their face which is felt to be related to the formation and deposition of immune complexes (Young and Brown 2004). After several days, the rash may spread and may then appear on the chest, back, buttocks, and extremities. On the soles of the feet, the rash may be especially pruritic (Sharad and Kapur 2005). The rash clears in a week or two, and when it begins to resolve, it may appear \u201clacy\u201d in appearance. The rash may be very \u201cfleeting\u201d (<24 h), but recurrences may be induced by exposure to sunlight, heat, emotion, or strenuous exercise.

The pathology of cutaneous B19 infection suggests tissue injury mediated by delayed-type hypersensitivity, by antibody-dependent cellular immunity directed at microbial antigenic targets in the epidermis and endothelium, and by circulating immune complexes in the setting of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (Magro et al. 2000). In patients with transient aplastic crisis, the bone marrow will have erythroid hypoplasia and occasional giant erythroblasts and may rarely have proerythoid cells with intranuclear viral inclusions (Crook et al. 2000).

Such effusions may also be seen in autoimmune diseases and viral pneumonias. Desquamated balls of reactive type II pneumocytes may be abundant with large nuclei with increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, prominent clumped chromatin and large round to irregular nucleoli, and eosinophilic inclusions (Fig. 16.1). The lungs may show classic changes of diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes, reactive type II pneumocytes, and lymphocytic infiltrates (Beske et al 2007). In acute presentations, the lungs may show intra-alveolar hemorrhage due to weakened and damaged intraseptal capillaries. Viral inclusions are extremely difficult to find except in rare patients who are immunocompromised. Immunohistochemistry is however helpful highlighting infected cells (Fig. 16.2). The diagnosis is based on serological rise of PV IgM and DNA evidence of PV from lung biopsy or cytologic specimens (Berjaoui et al. 2006). The exact pathogenesis of severe pulmonary complications by B19 is not understood but may be related to a cytotoxic effect of the virus directly or indirectly on the interstitial endothelial cells. An aberrant host immune response triggered by B19 may also contribute to the pulmonary pathology (Magro et al. 2006). The lung tissues are not the preferred site for virus replication in humans or other mammals. This is why PV B19 pneumonia is very rare or unrecognized. B19 DNA may persist perpetually in human tissues such as skin, synovial cells, and hepatocytes. The significance of a positive PCR for PV B19 may be related to the amount observed. Since it may be harbored in healthy tissues, PCR detection of PV B19 during an illness may not be definitive proof that PV is the cause of the lung injury unless other causes are excluded. In immunocompromised patients with PV B19 pneumonia, it is difficult to determine if it is a new infection associated with viremia or a reactivation of virus dormant within the lung tissues. In fact, simultaneous infection with two pathogens often results in enhanced morbidity and mortality, in particular in immunocompromised patients (Broliden 2001).\n\n\n",

In the lung, the changes may be similar to collagen vascular diseases, infections due to other viruses, and even lepidic adenocarcinoma. The differential diagnosis includes many entities which may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome. The transient or rapid anemia with or without skin rash can help in recognizing the infection. Because PV can create an environment with lower resistance to other opportunistic pathogens, a concurrent fungal or bacterial pneumonia may overshadow the effects of PV B19.",

Technology to express viral proteins VP1 and VP2, derived from a copy of the parvovirus B-19 genome (strain Au) obtained from a child with sickle cell disease and transient aplastic crisis, was developed at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Individual viral proteins were expressed in a baculovirus system and, when recombinant vectors are cotransfected into insect cells, VP1 and VP2 spontaneously assemble into empty viral-like particles. The vaccine consists of two viral proteins (VP1 and VP2) in separate baculovirus vectors that are coinfected at the correct multiplicity of infections (MOIs) into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and that, upon expression, self-assemble into immunogenic viruslike particles. Phase 1 trials have been completed, but mass production is needed for testing (Bernstein et al. 2011).",

The clinical presentations may vary from irritative (upper respiratory infections and rashes) to severe (diffuse alveolar damage with ARDS, arthropathy, cardiomyopathy, fulminant hepatitis, hydrops fetalis, and aplastic crisis). A definitive diagnosis can be made with detection of IgM by serology and specific PVB19 DNA PCR. A previous infection results in lifelong immunity unless the patient is immunocompromised.",
