COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 among patients with viral pneumonia symptoms in Wuhan, China (3, 4). They were found to be related with the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, where other non-aquatic animals were also being sold before the outbreak (5). As of 20th April 2020, over 2.4 million cases and 165,000 deaths have been reported globally (6, 7). Europe is the most affected with over 50% of cases and 60% of deaths reported in this region (8). United States of America has the highest number of cases globally (695,350 cases) and the highest number of deaths (32,427 deaths) (8). African region is the least affected with 13,892 cases and 628 deaths, but the numbers are increasing (8). Uganda has so far confirmed 55 cases of COVID-19 as of 20th April 2020 (7, 8).",

Old age and patients with pre-existing illnesses (like hypertension, cardiac disease, lung disease, cancer, or diabetes) have been identified as potential risk factors for severe disease and mortality (9, 10). To date, there is no antiviral curative treatment or vaccine that has been recommended for COVID-19 (11). More information about its distribution, transmission, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention are being studied. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends prevention of human-to-human transmission by protecting close contacts and health care workers from being infected and stopping infections from animal sources (8). Primary preventive measures include regular hand washing, social distancing, and respiratory hygiene (covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing) (12, 13).",

A poor understanding of the disease among HCWs can result in delayed identification and treatment leading to rapid spread of infections. Over 100 health workers have lost their lives to COVID\u221219, a tragedy to the world and a barrier to fight against the disease (15). Guidelines for healthcare workers and online refresher courses have been developed by WHO, CDC, and various governmental organizations in various countries to boost the knowledge and prevention strategies (16). There is paucity of literature on KAPs of HCWs toward the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a study with majorly Asian HCWs and medical students revealed that they had insufficient knowledge about COVID-19 but had a positive attitude toward prevention of COVID-19 transmission (17). To our knowledge, no study has been done in sub-Saharan Africa to assess KAPs toward COVID-19 specifically among HCWs. The purpose of the study was to assess the KAPs of HCWs in Uganda toward COVID-19.",

Generally, majority of the HCWs had sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 which is in line with findings in Vietnam about COVID-19 (25). In contrast, it is conflicting to surveys by Bhagavathula et al. on COVID-19 (17), a baseline study among nurses in Gabon on Ebola (26) and HCWs in Ethiopia on Ebola (27) who all reported poor knowledge. From our study, 69% of HCW had sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 which is lower than values reported by Huynh et al. where 88.4% had sufficient knowledge on COVID-19 (25).

            "text": "In conclusion, we found that more than two-third of HCWs in Makerere University Teaching Hospitals have sufficient knowledge on the transmission, diagnosis and prevention of the transmission of COVID-19. Knowledge on COVID-19 was significantly higher among HCWs who used news media such as televisions and newspapers and those aged 18\u201339 were more knowledgeable about COVID-19. There was no statistically significant difference in the level of knowledge about COVID-19 among health care workers in Uganda irrespective of their professions or qualifications. About four-fifth of the respondents had poor attitude toward COVID-19 and just over 70% of the HCWs had good practices toward COVID-19 especially those aged 40 years or more. Continued professional education is advised among HCWs in Uganda to improve knowledge of HCWs hence averting negative attitudes and promoting positive preventive and therapeutic practices. We recommend follow up studies involving teaching and non-teaching hospitals across the country.",
