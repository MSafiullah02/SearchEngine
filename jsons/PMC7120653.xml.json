Of these the most commonly diagnosed in the pediatric population is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which infects essentially all children in their first or second year of life, bringing approx 1% into the hospital with bronchiolitis or pneumonia (1). Children with underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease, or born prematurely are particularly at risk. The virus also causes problems in the immunosuppressed and mortality rates are alarmingly high for RSV pneumonia after bone marrow transplantation (2). The availability of therapy with ribavirin (3) or high titer anti-RSV \u03b3-globulin (4), which may be of benefit in these at risk groups, places a premium on rapid and accurate, but cost effective, diagnosis.",

Although this approach can be speeded up by the immunofluorescence staining of early cultures with virus-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), culture can never match the speed of direct antigen detection in specimens using either immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassay. Although in most studies virus culture shows marginally greater sensitivity than the rapid techniques, occasionally antigen detection may succeed where virus culture fails, Whether antigen detection methods alone, without the backup of virus culture, are adequate to provide a reliable diagnostic service remains a controversial issue.",

Furthermore, suitable antibodies are available for all of the major and many of the minor viral respiratory pathogens Table 1) which can thus be tested for on a single multiwell slide offering great flexibility at reasonable cost.

            "text": "\nA vast range of MAbs to viral antigens are available commercially and through other channels, but very few of these are likely to be suitable for diagnostic purposes. Some currently available MAbs or MAb pools designed for antigen detection in clinical material are listed in Table 1. Also noteworthy are the polyvalent pools of antibodies to RSV, the influenzaviruses, the parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses produced by some manufacturers. These allow one-test screening for significant respiratory virus pathogens, reducing the costly screening of negative samples against multiple type specific reagents.For more information prior to purchasing consult E O. Caul (13)Not all objectives are suitable for fluorescence microscopy owing to autofluorescence of some components or excessive internal light scattering. Manufacturers should be able to give advice on those most suitable.Adequate specimens must contain a reasonable number of respiratory epithelial cells derived from the nasopharyngeal epithelium Squamous epithelial cells, derived from the anterior an passages, are not generally infectedIt is advisable to carry out the handling of material likely to generate airborne pathogens in a class 2 containment cabinet.Cell cultures exhibiting extensive cytopathic effect may detach on washing In this case, the cells should be scraped and pipeted directly into the culture medium. Cells are pelleted at 380g for 5 min at room temperature, resuspended to original volume in PBS to wash, and recentrifuged to obtained a washed cell pellet. A similar procedure is adopted for virus-infected cultures of nonadherent cellsAcetone should not be stored in conventional refrigerators as it poses an explosion hazard A Coplin jar of acetone in an ice bath is convenient for fixing a small number of slides. For cell culture preparations, which are free from mucus, fixation may be reduced to 5 min.Specificity of reagents cannot be taken for granted, particularly when clinical material is being investigated and adequate controls must be included to reveal non-specific reactions. The following should be included for the indirect test\nA cell preparation similar to the test specimen but known to be negative for the virus in question, stained in parallel with the test specimen Once sure of all the reagents and methods and familiar with the patterns of staining they produce, experienced workers may choose to omit this control.A duplicate preparation of the test specimen stained with a negative antibody as similar as possible to the virus-specific antibody in use, followed by the FlTC-conjugated antiglobulin. Where a polyclonal antiserum from an animal is employed, the ideal control would be the preimmune serum from the same animal. This is rarely available for commercial products and here a serum from an animal immunized by a similar protocol with an antigen likely to be absent from the specimen (e g., another virus) must suffice.where MAbs are employed a MAb of the same immunoglobulin class but specific for an irrelevant antigen known to be absent from the specimen should be usedA duplicate preparation of the test specimen stained with PBS, instead of the virus specific antibody, followed by the FITC-conjugated antiglobulin.\nAlthough the maker\u2019s instructions or advice from other laboratories may be taken as a guide, optimal working dilutions vary widely from laboratory to laboratory (14). It is always advisable to titrate new antibody preparations in your laboratory. Normally, testing preparations fivefold either side of the recommended dilution on known positive control material will suffice.For cell culture preparations, in which nonspecific staining is less troublesome, 5-min soaks will suffice.In the direct test the controls should include:\nA cell preparation similar to the test specimen but known to be negative for the virus in question and stained in parallel with the test specimen.A duplicate preparation of the test specimen stained with a negative control conjugated antibody as similar as possible to the virus-specific conjugated antibody to be employed. Where a polyclonal antibody from an animal has been purified and conjugated, the most suitable control would be the preimmune serum from the same animal similarly purlfied and conjugated. Where such is not available, a similar conjugated antiserum from the same species but specific for an antigen known to be absent from the test specimen will suffice. Where conjugated MAbs are employed, a conjugated MAb of the same immunoglobulin class but specific for an antigen known to be absent from the test specimen should be used. The specificity of fluorescent staining can be confirmed in a subsequent blocking test. Here, preparations of the test specimen are preincubated with either unconjugated virus-specific antibody or unconjugated negative-control antibody. On subsequent staining with Conjugated antibody, specific fluorescent staining will be blocked by the latter but not the former\nIn the direct immunofluorescence test this incubation period may be reduced to 15 min for many conjugated MAbs in line with manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n",
