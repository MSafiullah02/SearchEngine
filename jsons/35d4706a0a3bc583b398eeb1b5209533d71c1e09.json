            "text": "As cases of the novel coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) continue to rise, the way in which healthcare is practiced has been markedly impacted. The presence of this new threat has changed the paradigm of society as many self-quarantine, socially distance, and avoid contact to mitigate the rapid spread of the virus. As new evidence regarding SARS-Cov-2 from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Central of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are reported, medical practice guidelines are in constant flux regarding patient care. In the span of the recent weeks, elective surgeries have been cancelled, non-urgent office visits rescheduled, and even practice of physical exams and diagnostic tests have changed. It is of no surprise that the practice of otolaryngology has been affected, as new guidelines emerge daily from the American Academy of Otolaryngology -Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS), multiple international otolaryngologic societies, and various affiliated university otolaryngologic departments. [1] [2] [3] [4] These guidelines have been put in place to curtail the feared development of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 in the susceptible patient population. 5 Though practice guidelines have been put in place to mitigate spread among healthcare workers, the identification of infected patients remains at the forefront in reducing transmission within the community. Since PCR testing has been limited, healthcare workers must rely on screening. However, it has been observed that rapid changes in SARS-CoV-2 screening are related to the constant influx of newer evidence as it comes to light.",

The proposed mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 induced anosmia is likely what has been previously reported in the literature as PVOD. A literature review was performed by one author searching for all published English-language literature reporting on PVOD. A search strategy was employed with the following search strings: \"virus OR corona OR covid\" with \"anosmia OR olfaction disorder OR hyposmia OR dysgeusia OR olfactory dysfunction\" in the last 5 years.

Central olfactory dysfunction is seen in disorders of the central nervous system, commonly from neurodegenerative diseases or head injury, where olfactory bulb projections to the olfactory mucosa are sheared in the cribriform plate. Lastly, sensorineural olfactory dysfunction is seen in patients where degeneration of the olfactory epithelium and nerves occur secondary to a viral infection or less likely from a drug-induced impairment. 10, 11, 13 Differences in etiologies obviates distinct treatment approaches and management. For the basis of this article, we will focus on PVOD as it pertains to sensorineural dysfunction caused by a viral illness, correlating it with potential SARS-CoV-2 infectivity status.",

            "text": "A highly discussed and debated topic is SARS-CoV-2 screening, especially in asymptomatic patients or in individuals that do not meet the current criteria for testing, given that tests are limited and resources scarce. In order to mitigate the rapid spread and to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system, screening is paramount so that appropriate measures can be implemented such as self-isolation and social distancing, actions that reduce the propagation of inadvertent community spread. 5, 17, 18 One important, symptom that has been rapidly gaining precedence is anosmia. Hyposmia and dysgeusia are also reported at varying degrees. 8 Anecdotal reports have been gaining traction as anosmia has been commonly expressed in positive SARS-CoV-2 patients globally, ranging anywhere from 15% and 66%, often in the absence of any other symptoms. 6, 8, 9 Strikingly, the majority of these individuals are in their 20s, who otherwise might not feel the need to adopt necessary precautions as they are relatively asymptomatic and otherwise health. 8 has not been found to be a major contributor to PVOD. In a prospective study by Malhotra et al 21 , clinical features of patients infected with various viral strains were evaluated, of which, altered smell was one of the clinical symptoms investigated. Among the 30% of their study population that reported dysosmia, influenza was not significantly associated with a change in smell because only 10% of upper respiratory infections are caused by influenza. It is important to note that coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) were not tested and that their study does not identify which viral strains were associated with an altered sense of smell among their study group. It begs the question that coronavirus may have been among those infected that developed PVOD. We suggest that because coronavirus (non SARS-CoV-2 strains) is among the many viruses that collectively account for 70% of the common cold, which in turn can cause PVOD, its presence among their study population must be taken into consideration. 19 Furthermore, given that the SARS-CoV-2 is part of the larger family of coronaviridae, reports of asymptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients experiencing anosmia can be further evidenced by the aforementioned studies. 16 The exact pathophysiology of PVOD is not well understood. The leading evidence suggests several mechanisms. Nasal mucosal inflammation and swelling from a viral infection obstructs airflow from adequately delivering odors to the olfactory mucosa. 19, 20, 22 Viral disruption of the olfactory mucosa may also participate in the severity of dysosmia, such that the severities and time courses observed in patients infected by the same virus may suggest a component of reactivity in the olfactory mucosa to the viral load and viral serotype. 19, 20, 22 Anosmia is regularly evaluated by the otolaryngologist. However, in the midst of the current pandemic, practice guidelines have been rapidly changing. As recommended by the AAO-HNS and international societies, certain physical exams and procedures should be limited to urgent cases. Many physical exams and in-office procedures places the otolaryngologist in close proximity with mucosal tissue, blood, and aerosolized particles placing them at high risk. [14] [15] [16] [17] 23 This presents several problems as patients with anosmia warrant a full history and physical exam, where nasal endoscopy is standard in evaluating a patient with anosmia. Endoscopy provides valuable visualization of the nasal passageway that might reveal the presence of an obstruction, mucosal inflammation, polyps, or even malignancies that may obstruct the olfactory cleft. 10, 22 These practice changes place the otolaryngologist and the patient in unique predicament.",

            "text": "However, given the rapidity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the rise of olfactory dysfunction as being an only symptom in infected patients, it is imperative that these correlations be taken seriously. With the limited evidence, it becomes necessary to review the literature in order to guide current protocols during this time. No peerreviewed data have been reported relating SARS-CoV-2 and PVOD, largely because symptoms of anosmia have only recently come to the attention of medical practitioners. It is well known that various viruses such as influenza, adenovirus, various coronavirus strains (229E, NL63, OC43), bocavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus (serotypes 1-3), and rhinovirus all can cause pneumonia and severe respiratory symptoms. 14,16 However, not all individuals routinely develop pneumonia or severe respiratory symptoms. In the majority of cases, infected individuals only experience mild upper respiratory symptoms; some may experience a variation of anosmia, hyposmia, or dysgeusia. In a study done by Suzuki et al 19 , patients that had an acute onset of PVOD without any prior history of olfactory dysfunction, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, or neurological dysfunction were identified. Their selected cohort met the criteria of sensorineural olfactory dysfunction. Coronavirus (CoV 229E) was among the viral strains identified to cause anosmia. In a study by \u00c5kerlund et al 20 , PVOD developed after healthy human subjects with no previous olfactory deficiencies were inoculated with coronavirus. Interestingly enough, influenza",
