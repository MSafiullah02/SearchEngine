In the field of bacterial infection, this was facilitated by the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Sir Alexander Fleming [1]. Unfortunately, as antibiotics became more widely used, bacteria responded by developing various forms of resistance to these treatments, which has rapidly accelerated creating a serious and global problem [2]. Very few antimicrobials have been developed in the last two decades which is now limiting the scope of action [3]. Currently, antibiotics also lack diversity in their cellular targets and new antibiotic classes are urgently needed as treatment choices become limited [3]. As the use of these antibiotics has increased so has the level, response, and complexity of resistance by microbes [4].",

Staphylococcus aureus resistance is widespread. People infected with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) are estimated to be 64% more likely to die than people with a non-resistant form of the infection. Colistin is the last resort treatment for life-threatening infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae, which are resistant to carbapenems. Resistance to Colistin has recently been detected in several countries and regions, making infections caused by such bacteria untreatable [8].",

From 2000 to 2010 the rapidly emerging economies of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) countries contributed to 76% of the growth in antibiotic consumption. Data suggests that the top three consumers are India at 12.9 billion units, China at 10.0 billion units, and USA at 6.8 billion units in 2010 [9]. In BRICS countries, the increase in antibiotic misuse has been partly due to the increasing size of the population, but also improved drug access and socioeconomic status. The absence of antibiotic policies has also played an important role. However, the USA has the highest level of antibiotic misuse for both humans and livestock and is also where antimicrobial stewardship programmes are not widely implemented [10].",

They are readily available for patients to buy themselves and appear to be increasingly popular particularly in the UK. This growing public interest in herbs could reduce reliance on antibiotics, especially for self-limiting infections. A recent WHO report on traditional medicines noted that the majority of the world\u2019s population depends on traditional medicines for primary healthcare including the treatment of infections [31]. Plant secondary metabolites have already demonstrated their potential as antimicrobials when used alone and or synergistically, or as potentiators of other antimicrobial medicines. The use of these metabolites and herbal medicines as resistance-modifying agents (RMAs) represents an increasingly active research area. Phytomedicines frequently act through different mechanisms than conventional antibiotics and could, therefore be of use in the treatment of resistant bacteria. Plant extracts have great potential as antimicrobial compounds against microorganisms especially in addressing the therapeutic vacuum in managing symptoms or acting as antimicrobial medicines themselves. The therapeutic utility of these products, will, however, require further research and undergo strict quality control to guarantee product consistency [32].",
