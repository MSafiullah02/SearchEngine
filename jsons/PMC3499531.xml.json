Bats are the only mammals to have evolved powered flight, which has allowed dispersal across all continents other than Antarctica. Bats are critical components of ecosystems, serving as major predators of insects, pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds of keystone plant species worldwide. The body sizes of bats range from less than 2 gm with 8 cm wingspans to more than 1 kg with 2 m wingspans. Most contemporary species of bats are insect-, nectar-, or fruit-eaters, but about 1% are carnivores, including fish-eating and blood-drinking species.",

In total, more than 100 viruses have been isolated from, or detected in, bats of dozens of species, yet many of the viruses that cause disease in humans cause little or no disease in the bats. Significantly, the great majority of bat species have not been examined for infectious agents and are, thus, likely underappreciated as reservoir hosts. The continued encroachment of humans upon bat habitat and bat migrations caused by climate change may lead to novel infectious diseases among humans and livestock. Moreover, some infectious diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality in bats that could have dramatic impacts on population numbers and cascading ecological effects [14]. Thus, the study of bats and their infectious agents is an important but neglected aspect of zoonotic and wildlife disease research.",

The Jamaican fruit bat is a microbat in the family Phyllostomidae, which contains 56 genera and 192 species. They are a frugivorous generalist and fig specialist of medium size; about 80 mm in length with a wingspan of 130 mm and mass of about 50 grams. They can readily fly 20 km per night, although they typically maintain a smaller home range as long as food is available, and can live 9 years or more in the wild. Females typically produce two offspring per year and provide maternal care for about 50 days, with pups reaching adult body weight by about 80 days. Several microbes of interest have been isolated from or detected in Jamaican fruit bats, including Histoplasma capsulatum, Trypanosoma cruzi, eastern equine encephalitis virus, Mucambo virus, Jurona virus, Catu virus, Itaporanga virus and Tacaiuma virus, suggesting the species may be an important reservoir and vector of infectious diseases [15]\u2013[18].

TCRV was the first arenavirus isolated in the Americas and during the next decades other arenaviruses with substantial similarity to TCRV were identified that cause the South American hemorrhagic fevers (SAHF) [20], [21]. The known reservoir hosts for all other arenaviruses are rodents, making TCRV exceptional for its repeated isolation from artibeus bats. Because exhaustive searches for evidence of other potential reservoir hosts of TCRV failed to suggest another reservoir species [19], [22], it has been suspected that artibeus bats are reservoirs of the virus. However, recent work by us demonstrated that TRLV-11573, the only remaining isolate of TCRV, causes a fatal infection resembling the SAHF in Jamaican fruit bats, one of the species from which TCRV was isolated, or is cleared without disease, suggesting this species is not a suitable reservoir host for TCRV and the virus may be a significant pathogen for bats [23].",

No antibodies are available with known specificity to Jamaican fruit bat proteins, which dramatically limits its usefulness.

Using TGICL, a combined assembly of the 454 and Illumina contigs was constructed that contained 102,237 contigs with N10, N50, and N90 of 3,882 bp, 1,004 bp, and 289 bp, respectively.",

Human and mouse genomes were chosen for completeness of their annotations. Genomic features were divided into 5 groups: 1 Kb upstream of 5\u2032 UTR, 5\u2032 UTR, CDS (coding sequence), 3\u2032 UTR, 1 Kb downstream of 3\u2032 UTR. We found 58.03% and 23.18% mapped CDS region for human and mouse genome respectively (Figure 1A). Because we performed transcriptome sequencing, we expected a majority of the sequences to map to CDS and UTR regions of the genome. Many RNA genes were also mapped, including long noncoding RNAs and a substantial number of microRNAs (Figure 1B). Annotation was concentrated on identifying microRNAs because they could be cross validated through their RNA secondary structure features. To further obtain a confident set of microRNA sequences, a microRNA prediction pipeline was used to cross validate the BLAST mapping of prediction. In the process, 42 confident microRNA candidates were found that have been deposited within MirBase [24], [25]. We present the list of predicted microRNAs as Table S1. Mapping the predicted SNPs on the genomic features indicates that the vast majority of SNPs are in the CDS region (Figure 1C\u20131D). Although humans and mice are both outside Laurasiatheria the relatively fast rate of molecular evolution of mice is expected to result in more differences between bats and mice than bats and humans [26]\u2013[29]. The presence of sequences mapped 1 Kb upstream or downstream of the known transcript indicated possible alternative splicing from human and mouse transcripts.",

The BLASTX annotation process is biased by the completeness of the annotation for each respective genome; therefore, despite the lack of a completely annotated horse genome, a high similarity between bat and horse genomes was apparent. The human genome is well annotated, which explains the high number of BLAST hits between bat and human. The GO annotation divides the functional annotation into three main components: biological process, cellular process, and molecular [30]. A majority of the annotated genes encoding proteins that function within a cell or organelle are involved in metabolic and cellular processes. The primary molecular functions of these genes are catalytic and binding activities (Figures 3A\u2013C). A total of 466 immune-related genes were annotated by BLAST2GO. These immune genes include toll-like receptors, cytokines, transcription factors, kinases and several chemokine receptors. In addition, CateGOrizer was used to categorize the immune class using the GOslim database, resulting in 30 categories representing a broad range of immune activities (Figure 4).

The ratio between the rate of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous mutation (dN) can be used to infer the degree of selection operating on the system. We used the human genome as a reference for dN/dS calculations because the human genome is well annotated. Reciprocal BLAST was used to identify human, mouse, and bat orthologs. MACSE was used to generate codon alignments. The alignments were trimmed for excessive gap codon triplets, and PAML was used to calculate dN/dS for each gene. When genes are highly conserved, synonymous mutations (dS) tend to be estimated as 0, resulting in a larger dN/dS ratio, therefore those results were removed from the analysis. After filtering, dN/dS results were obtained for 14,717 genes. The majority of the genes have close to zero dN/dS with clear evidence of purifying selection, a feature common among mammalian genes [31]\u2013[33]. For investigation of positive selection, Tang et al. [34] have argued that a dN/dS threshold of greater than 1 for positive selection might be overly stringent. Because of this, a dN/dS cutoff of 0.7 was chosen to investigate genes that might be experiencing weak purifying selection. A total of 138 genes above the 0.7 threshold were found (Table S2).",

In total, we were able to account for 80% of the unannotated trancripts, and the remaining unannotated transcripts likely include misassembled contigs, contigs not sequenced sufficiently in the other bats to be included in their genome assemblies, as well as a few transcripts specific to Artibeus jamaicensis. Many additional analyses are warranted to further refine the transcriptome information from Artibeus and other bats.",

            "text": "Phylogenomics is an important tool for resolving the Tree of Life, and this transcriptome data set provides an opportunity to study the evolutionary history of bats. Bats were once thought to be closely related to primates [6]; however, further work using molecular information placed them within Laurasiatheria [40]. Our finding of bat as sister to the clade containing horse, dog, and cattle is consistent with the recent study by McCormack et al. [4] and Zhou et al [10]. Here, we used 2,378 loci from a microbat and species tree analyses to obtain 95% bootstrap support, whereas McCormack et al. use 683 loci to obtain 64%bootstrap support. A recent study by Nery et al. [5] obtained a concatenated data from 3,733 loci from megabat with 100% bootstrap support and 1.0 posterior probability placing bat as sister to cattle. Our phylogenetic tree is less resolved than Nery et al., probably because we did not include the more limited transcriptome data available from dolphin and hedgehog. Maximum likelihood analyses are powerful, yet can lead to incorrect conclusions in certain situations, whereas species tree analyses are less powerful but more robust to well-known violations of the models used for maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis, such as incomplete lineage sorting (see [5] and references therein). Additional work is clearly warranted, especially by using additional taxa, testing for convergence and specific violations of gene-tree models, and other sources of conflict among protein-coding genes and other portions of the genome.",

Although laboratory mice (Mus musculus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus), which have substantial experimental methodologies and reagents, can be infected with Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV), the etiologic agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, the pathogenesis is markedly different than human disease. The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) typically exhibits signs of disease that closely resembles human disease; however, there are few immunological or genetic tools for assessing the host response to infection. JUNV is also a BSL-4 and select agent, thus use of virulent strains is confined to only a few laboratories with highly specialized containment facilities. The pathogenesis of TCRV, a BSL-2 agent, in Jamaican fruit bats exhibits many similarities to the SAHF in humans, thus the use of transcriptome data could be useful for studying pathogenesis using a variety of new technologies, such as PCR arrays for pathway discovery, and for the development of antibodies to specific artibeus proteins that are important in the pathogenesis of disease.",

To do this, we first downloaded the xml file of annotated KEGG pathways [61], [62]for human and mouse. To identify genes that are functionally important within KEGG pathways, KEGGgraph was used to represent a graph form of the KEGG pathway. We further used KEGGgraph to compute the relative betweenness centrality, which is the algorithmic representation of the involvement of a node within a network. We chose to set a cutoff of grabbing the top 4 nodes within each network, or selecting the top 4 functionally important genes within each pathway [63].",

A customized java program was used to filter alignments (obtained through AQUA) with greater than 5% gap per sequence. Additionally, we filtered for sequences that are at least>1,000 bp long. PHYML 3 was used to generate a maximum likelihood gene tree [70], [71]. MrAIC, a perl script wrapper for PHYML, was used to infer the best substitution model for each gene tree based on AIC, AICc, BIC, and Akaike weights [72]. AIC was used as the objective function since not much variation was observed across different objective function. NJst was used to calculate the unrooted species tree based on our gene trees [73]. A customized Rprogram is used for Performing a nonparametric bootstrap species tree through resampling nucleotides within loci as well as resampling the loci within the data set as described by Seo [74].",
