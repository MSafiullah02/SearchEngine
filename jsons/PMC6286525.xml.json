            "text": "Influenza pandemics cause morbidity and mortality from both direct viral effects, which tend to present early (within the first few days), and secondary bacterial complications, which tend to present later (after the first week). Evidence of influenza predisposing to bacterial co-infection is seen in seasonal influenza epidemics, past pandemics, pathology studies and animal models [1\u20138]. Infection with influenza disrupts the respiratory tract by direct pathogenic effects, which then predisposes to bacterial secondary infection. Conversely, bacterial pathogens in the respiratory tract may also predispose to influenza and other viral infection [9]. During the 1918 pandemic, bacterial pneumonia was a major cause of morbidity and mortality, as shown by studies at the time as well as retrospective study of pathology specimens [10, 11]. At that time, antibiotics were not widely available as they are now, and it is thought that the high observed mortality rate was partially due to the inability to treat secondary bacterial sepsis. The most important bacterial co-infections during an influenza pandemic S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, and group A Streptococcus (1, 4). However, two early reviews of severe cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) showed no evidence of bacterial pneumonia among 30 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed cases in California (5) and 10 intensive-care patients in Michigan (6). These reports might have led to a perception that bacterial co-infections played a limited role or no role in pandemic influenza deaths in 2009.",

Databases searched included Medline, Pre-Medline, EmBASE and LILACS. The search strategy included a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and text words to improve the identification of relevant publications in which bacterial co-infection was not necessarily the primary outcome of interest. The World Health Organisation (WHO) advised on the use of the standardised nomenclature influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in October 2011 [13]. Prior to this time, various names were used to describe the pandemic virus. As such, a broad search strategy was developed to identify relevant literature in which clinical outcomes of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection were described.",

We have found evidence that severe and fatal cases of influenza during the 2009 pandemic did comprise secondary bacterial causes, including streptococcus pneumoniae as a contributing factor. Vaccination against streptococcus pneumonia is often neglected in pandemic planning [52], but could have a positive impact on morbidity and mortality. The evidence confirms that prevention of bacterial secondary infection should be an integral part of pandemic planning. Improving uptake of routine pneumococcal vaccination in adults with an indication will cover most patients at risk, and may reduce the impact of a pandemic.",
