A key aspect to successfully rearing these animals is to ensure adequate intake of colostrum to support the animal's passive immunity. Calves with adequate passive transfer of immunity have lower mortality and morbidity and fewer antibiotic treatments compared with animals with failure of passive transfer (Berge et al., 2005). Despite the general knowledge of the importance of feeding colostrum to the neonatal calf, calves arrive at calf ranches with suboptimal serum immunoglobulin levels (Besser et al., 1991; Besser and Gay, 1994; Hopkins and Quigley, 1997). To address this problem, it is a widely accepted practice to feed antimicrobials to preweaned calves (Braidwood and Henry, 1990; Constable, 2003; Glantz et al., 1974; Quigley et al., 1997).",

However, there is evidence that antibodies remaining in the gut lumen after colostrum feeding also provide local immunity against enteric viral infections and diarrhea caused by bacterial enterotoxins and may enhance intestinal villus development (Snodgrass et al., 1980, 1982; Saif and Bohl, 1983; Buhler et al., 1998). Given this observation, in the absence of properly administered colostrum, it is possible that a colostrum supplement could provide local gut immunity and decrease the need for supplemental antimicrobials in colostrum-deprived calves. The objective of this study (a multisite clinical trial) was to determine the effect of oral IgG supplementation on preweaned calf mortality, morbidity, weight gain, and feed intake. The hypothesis was that oral IgG supplementation during the early preweaning period decreases calf mortality and morbidity.",

On ranch C, the calves were fed nonmedicated milk replacer (22% CP and 18% CF). On all 3 ranches, it was standard procedure for calves to receive a colostrum supplement at the first feeding (usually the afternoon) following delivery to the ranch.

Despite our efforts to develop management approaches to ameliorate the negative impacts of FPT on calf mortality, we have yet to find an effective strategy. The high mortality on ranch C was attributed to a salmonellosis outbreak in the calves during a period of severe heat stress. Several study calves on ranch C had bloody diarrhea, and the calf pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Newport was recovered from fecal samples from ten 2-wk-old calves and four 4-wk-old calves, as well as from 4 postmortem samples of septicemic calves (A. C. B. Berge, personal communication). The failure to successfully treat these calves for diarrheal and systemic disease is likely due to an interaction between FPT and the virulence of the Salmonella Newport serovar, which has been reported as a calf and cow pathogen resulting in high mortality and resistant to the antimicrobials in the treatment protocols (Berge et al., 2004).",

The early weight gain difference for the CS calves may be due to additional nutrients from the colostrum supplement (Godden, 2008) and the observed increased grain consumption in this group. The placebo supplemented group also had greater grain consumption compared with controls, but the ADG at 28 d was not significantly different from controls. The increased grain intake in calves receiving a greater level of nutrition through the milk is in contrast to studies indicating that increased energy intake through the milk replacer leads to decreased grain intake in preweaned calves (Kuehn et al., 1994; Drackley, 2008). The greater weight gain in the colostrum-supplemented calves compared with the placebo-supplemented and control calves may be because of lower rates of morbidity. Diseases causing inflammation resulting in the release of cytokines can activate homeorhetic responses to direct nutrients from tissue deposition (i.e, weight gain) toward immunologic defense functions (Colditz, 2004). The ADG was greater in low-weight calves, most likely because these calves received more milk per kilogram of BW than heavier calves as all calves received similar quantities of milk replacer regardless of arrival weight. The calves with FPT also had lesser weight gains likely because of decreased nutrient utilization and reduced feed intake associated with more disease in these calves compared with calves with APT (Colditz, 2004). The only significant factors affecting weaning weight were FPT and the calf ranch. Different levels of grain intake on these ranches may partly explain the weaning weight differences. The relatively smaller weight gains in calves on calf ranch C compared with ranches A and B may also have been due to heat stress (Drackley, 2008).",

            "text": "Although ensuring that calves have APT is the most significant management factor to ensure the health of neonatal calves on calf ranches, colostrum supplementation during the first 2 wk of life in calves was effective in reducing diarrheal disease and the use of antimicrobials. The ADG up to 4 wk of age in colostrum-supplemented calves was significantly greater compared with that in control calves, likely because of a combination of greater energy intake through the liquid feed, increased grain intake, and fewer days with diarrhea. Calf ranch systems need to continue to address problems of colostrum-deprived calves, pathogen load, and environmental stress to successfully raise calves and minimize prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotic use. Supplementing calves with a colostrum product may be a valuable tool to achieve these goals.",
