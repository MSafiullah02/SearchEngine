ARDS is a frequently encountered condition with an incidence of 78.9 cases per 100,000 people per year (56). According to the recent Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE), worldwide ARDS represents 10.4% of all ICU admissions with an overall mortality rate of 35.3% (5). In Canada, the average total hospital cost per patient with ARDS was $128,860 (2002 Canadian dollars), with the majority of this cost generated in the ICU ($97,810; 6, 27). Despite decades of ongoing ARDS research, there is still a battery of unmet challenges that are contributing to the perplexity of the condition. A better mechanistic understanding of ARDS may enable further improvement in the diagnosis, classification, and management of this complex syndrome. This will be potentially achieved by identification of biomarkers early in the disease process that reflect the underlying alveolocapillary membrane injury, whether the pattern is epithelial injury, endothelial injury, or a combination.",

The identified phenotypes have generally been reproducible and correlated well with clinical aspects of ARDS such as ventilator-free days, organ failure-free days, response to fluid management, and mortality (14, 23). However, some of the limitations encountered in these studies include the broad variations in the populations recruited, variable timing of the measurement of the biomarkers from one study to another, and very few biomarkers being longitudinally compared in the same patients (32). Additionally, the subgrouping biomarkers and their consequent ARDS subtypes have not focused on pathophysiologic changes, and they need to be prospectively studied for biomarker validation (36, 37).",

These include systems biology approaches, most notably, metabolomics, for example. In this review, we will shed light on the potential of using metabolomics in ARDS to identify biomarkers of disease and demonstrate the rich details that this technology can reveal about the biological mechanisms involved in ARDS.",

            "text": "Metabolomics is an emerging field of \u201comics\u201d studies that uses a systems biology approach to examine metabolism and metabolites. Contrary to routine clinical chemistry, which relies on the measurement of single metabolites (such as glucose or lactate), metabolomics allows for the simultaneous evaluation of a large set of metabolites/biological compounds in a single sample (2), thus providing an integrative snapshot view of biological systems (38). Although the use of biological fluid metabolites for diagnosis of medical conditions has been in existence since ancient times, modern metabolomics analysis began in the mid-1980s with the development of higher-sensitivity nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopes (47). Metabolites are small molecules up to ~1,000 Da and include a spectrum of compounds such as organic acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, peptides, vitamins, steroids, and xenobiotics, among others (24). The fundamental premise in metabolomics analyses is that changes, whether physiological or pathological, cause alterations in the metabolome that are detected as variations in metabolite concentrations. Commonly used metabolomics platforms include nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and increasingly, studies tend to incorporate multiple techniques. A brief explanation of the typical workflow of a metabolomics study is provided in Fig. 1. Data analysis is the most challenging step in metabolomics experiments, and this is further compounded by the increasing complexity of data sets generated as the machinery improves (45). Detection, quantification, analysis, and careful interpretation of a combination of small molecules generates a metabolic \u201cbiopattern,\u201d \u201cprofile,\u201d or \u201cfingerprint\u201d that can potentially serve as a biomarker for the underlying condition. Given the scope of this review, only a cursory overview of metabolomics has been provided. More comprehensive information can be found elsewhere in the literature (2, 4, 40, 41).",

However, unlike other omics technologies, there are significantly fewer metabolites (~5,000\u201310,000 identified in humans) than proteins (~1,000,000), transcripts (~100,000), or genes (~25,000; 55). This renders metabolomics data more readily analyzable and compilable into unique biopatterns compared with other omics fields (33, 55). Additionally, metabolomics targets a level downstream in the biological cascade (55), and thus it is closer to phenotype, more reflective of the real-time perturbations in the biological processes, and more responsive to environmental influences among all the omics technologies (38). On the other hand, the inherent nature of ARDS, which requires an environmental trigger for the condition to manifest, is suboptimally suited for certain omics studies. For example, in ARDS genomic studies, individuals with a potential ARDS genetic susceptibility who have not sustained an adequate environmental trigger would not manifest ARDS and could very well be assigned to the control group thereby reducing the statistical power (53).",

Serum, plasma, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), tissue samples, and even exhaled breath condensate (EBC) can be used for metabolomics detection after simple preparation (41). The sample types commonly utilized in metabolomics studies of ARDS, their recommended preparation, and their advantages and disadvantages are summarized in Table 1. It can be argued that circulating metabolites (e.g., obtained from serum or plasma) represent the summation of a complex interplay of diverse biological systems and thus fall short of local lung metabolites (e.g., obtained from BALF or EBC) in studying ARDS. Although this argument may be intuitively sound, the local lung sampling techniques provide samples that are scarce in metabolites, often diluted with high concentration of salt, less standardized, and less suitable for prospective follow-up, and the sampling technique (i.e., bronchoscopy) can be overly invasive in the context of critically ill patients. Moreover, as a patchy disease that occurs in consequence to both pulmonary and extrapulmonary causes, ARDS may be more amenable to systemic compartment sampling (i.e., serum/plasma) that allows monitoring of extrapulmonary processes and provides an average estimate of processes occurring in the lungs.",

However, some of the cellular responses that occur in ARDS can be derived from studying cultured human cell models. For example, the effect of bacterial infection on the metabolome of A549 cultured human airway epithelial cells (mimics an infection-related direct lung injury) demonstrated an increase in extracellular secretion of glutamate and pyruvate (28).

Nine metabolites were profiled, and it was found that a significantly decreased level of isoprene was present in the patients with ARDS compared with ventilated ICU controls [9.8 (8.2\u201321.6) vs. 21.8 (13.9\u201341.4) nmol\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7min\u22121, medians (95% confidence intervals), P = 0.04; 57]. Isoprene is a by-product of cholesterol synthesis through the mevalonate pathway (34). Additionally, isoprene is the most prevalent hydrocarbon in breath (34) though it exhibits a highly variable concentration. The exact physiological role of isoprene remains unclear although it is postulated that it may exert a thermoprotective function in cells exposed to heat stress and may have a protective effect against reactive oxygen species (35). Of note, the small sample size, the lack of exhaled breath follow-up validation studies, and the difficulties associated with reproducibility of GC-MS results make it hard to extrapolate the results to the extremely heterogeneous groups of patients with ARDS.",

This metabolomics fingerprint reflects the complex array of biological processes involved in ARDS pathogenesis, namely, oxidative stress (glutathione), energy metabolism (adenosine), apoptosis (phosphatidylserine), and disruption of the endothelial barrier (sphingomyelin; 7, 13, 42). The study demonstrated a very weak association between acute physiology score, myoinositol, and total glutathione (rs = 0.53, q = 0.25, P = 0.05 and rs = 0.56, q = 0.25, P = 0.04, respectively), yet suggested they may be used for determination of disease severity. Given the research evidence of the impact of mechanical ventilation on metabolites (31, 48) and the fact that the majority of patients with ARDS have some form of respiratory support, the use of healthy nonventilated controls is a potentially important confounder in the Stringer et al.

Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in the lung surfactant, and its level inversely correlates with lung injury caused by inflammatory cells (62). Remarkably, several uric acid precursor metabolites were profoundly increased (hypoxanthine 41-fold, xanthine 19-fold, and guanosine 4-fold). Uric acid further aggravates the lung injury by inducing acute inflammation, let alone its production by xanthine oxidase enzyme, which intensifies the oxidative stress by liberating O2\u2212 (62).",

The group compared their findings with Calfee et al.\u2019s results (14); however, because of lack of plasma samples a conclusion was not possible (54). The study could not differentiate between patients with ARDS and hydrostatic pulmonary edema controls (54). Pathway analysis of the 235 significant metabolites revealed a statistically significant overrepresentation of a single pathway (alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism).

A final predictive model consisting of six metabolites (proline, lysine/arginine, taurine, threonine, and glutamate) was constructed to separate mild and moderate/severe ARDS (accuracy = 0.91, R2Y = 0.72, and Q2 = 0.60; 67). Pathway analysis indicated the dysregulation of arginine and proline metabolism; lysine biosynthesis and degradation; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism; and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism (67). Interestingly, an increased level of taurine has been linked to the severity of lung inflammation (69). Taurine regulates epithelial cells\u2019 osmotic balance and plays a role in the protection against oxidative damage caused by neutrophil myeloperoxidase (16).

            "text": "Table 2 summarizes all the human ARDS studies discussed above. We have run an integrative pathway analysis using 27 significant metabolites (acetate, alanine, lysine, aspartate, glutathione, formate, arginine, glutamine, acetaldehyde, choline, leucine, histidine, proline, phosphatidylcholine, acetoacetate, valine, lactate, threonine, adenosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, guanosine, isoleucine, ethanol, sphingomyelin, betaine, and phosphatidylserine) identified in the studies that compared ARDS and controls. The pathways were plotted using Cytoscape v.3.6.0 software (MetScape plugin v.3.1.3; Supplemental Fig. S1; Supplemental Material for this article is available online at the American Journal of Physiology Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology website). Comprehensive details of the metabolites used are provided in Supplemental Table S1. Despite the apparent discrepancies between the studies\u2019 results, the plot demonstrates an overall biological relatedness among the identified metabolites. This may be explained by the multicollinear nature of the metabolites along with differences in sample types, sample preparations, and analytical sensitivities that collectively can favor the selection of one or another metabolite among a group of biologically interconnected metabolites. The plot generally reflects a biological profile of deranged energy metabolism (activation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis), enhanced collagen synthesis and fibrosis (arginine and proline metabolism), negative nitrogen balance (urea cycle), inflammation (glycerophospholipid metabolism), and accelerated cellular turnover (purine and pyrimidine metabolism) that is commonly perceived in patients with ARDS. Interestingly, higher levels of BCA (essential amino acids comprising leucine, isoleucine, and valine) were reported in the sera and mini-BALF of patients with ARDS by Singh et al. (58) and Rai et al. (51), respectively. BCA elevation has been consistently linked to insulin resistance (25, 30, 71). Whether the elevation of BCA levels in ARDS is related to protein catabolism, preexisting type II diabetes mellites, or the possibility of an unidentified ARDS-associated insulin resistance needs further investigation to get a clear insight into this relation especially when recent research suggests that diabetes mellites may confer a protection against mortality in direct ARDS (43). The plethora of biological details that can be drawn from interpretation of metabolomics biomarkers serves as a showcase for the ability of metabolomics to provide new insights into pathogenesis and its prospects for advancing our understanding of the biology of ARDS (3, 55). However, the complex nature of the metabolite interactions and the analytical variability require validation before metabolomics fingerprints can be used as valid clinical biomarkers.",

            "text": "Despite the immense potential, ARDS metabolomics research is still in its infancy. So far, metabolomics studies of ARDS have mostly focused on differentiating ARDS from control subjects and deriving a metabolic signature of the disease. Yet careful examination of the results reveals disagreements. Many factors contribute to these disagreements, such as the variability in study population and control group, the variability in the types and timing of samples, and the differences in the analytical methods used. This emphasizes the critical need for standardizing the recruitment of patients, inclusion of a proper ARDS study cohort representative of the spectrum of the condition, inclusion of ventilated ICU controls, careful matching between the controls and the study cohort, and carefully standardizing the sampling and preparation techniques. Additionally, it is crucially important to increase the studies\u2019 sample size in general, verify findings in independent validation studies, and run prospective longitudinal studies to ascertain enough statistical power, ensure the reproducibility of the results, and track the disease development process, respectively. There is a lack of consensus as to which sample type is most appropriate for ARDS metabolomics studies. We think that readily available noninvasive sample types, e.g., plasma and serum, are suitable choices in critically ill patients, though only good-quality studies and time will tell.",

Again, this stresses the importance of standardization, comparison, and consensus building in this area (12).",

Out of the aforementioned ARDS studies, only that of Rogers et al. (54) followed this approach using metabolomics. Further studies along this line can be improved by applying strategies for increasing statistical power and standardization. Endotyping is a major change in the thought process about ARDS that will potentially reformulate the present definition of the condition and allow proper selection of uniform patient subsets for further research, and it may even help in discovering specific therapies.",

Following major breakthroughs achieved in examining similarly heterogeneous disorders, such as asthma (18, 20), the approach of subclassifying ARDS according to the driving molecular mechanisms rather than empirical clinical features could improve several aspects of care. The nascent field of metabolomics has a promising capability for biomarker discovery as demonstrated in several preliminary small ARDS studies. This type of work should be encouraged and supported in the future. Proper validation of any of the findings is critical in metabolomics-based studies in the future.",

These methods may be employed for either global screening of all possible metabolites (untargeted approach) or selected measurement of specific metabolites (targeted approach). 3) Analysis of resultant spectral data and metabolite selection. 4) Putative metabolite identification using compound libraries. NMR results are quantitative whereas GC-MS/LC-MS results can be quantitative only in targeted approaches. 5) Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. The most commonly used multivariate analyses include principal component analysis and partial least squares analysis; however, there is a battery of methods that are becoming increasingly reported in literature, e.g., orthogonal partial least squares analysis, random forest analysis, support vector machines analysis, and K-means clustering. 6) Interpretation and, if applicable, identification of relevant pathways involved.
