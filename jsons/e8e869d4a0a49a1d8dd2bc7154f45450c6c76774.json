With these targets, multiplexing of primers produces a screening assay that represents a reasonable compromise between target range and practicality, testing large numbers of referred clinical specimens. However, a substantial proportion of respiratory infections remain undiagnosed, not least because screening for several other viruses associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTIs and LRTIs, respectively) is not frequently performed. Screening tests for respiratory viruses often omit influenz C virus, human rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses, as well as parechoviruses and enteroviruses.",

When several direct methods of virus detection (i.e., PCR, immunofluo escence, and culture) were combined with serological testing for the virus targets mentioned above (but not for PIV-4, parechoviruses, influenz C virus, and group 2 coronaviruses), a viral cause was detected for 88% of cases of bronchiolitis and other diagnosed LRTIs requiring the hospitalization of young children [1] . These finding indicate that, even with relatively exhaustive testing, there still remains a potential window for the diagnosis of other, uncharacterized respiratory pathogens. The proportion of unaccounted infections may indeed vary in different geographical areas with different virus epidemiological profile (reviewed in [1] ).",

The overall prevalence of HBoV infection was higher in the present study than in previous studies conducted in Sweden, Australia, Japan, Canada, and France [3, [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, these studies differ in their design; some estimated the prevalence of HBoV infection among all samples referred to a diagnostic laboratory for respiratory virus testing (i.e., studies from Sweden [3] and Canada [7] ), whereas other studies limited estimation of the prevalence of HBoV infection to samples obtained from individuals with respiratory disease (Australia [5] ) or samples obtained from pediatric patients (patients !5 years of age in the French study [8] ). The Japanese study [6] was restricted to assessment of samples obtained from children who had LRTIs and excluded samples that were positive for other respiratory viruses (RSV, influenz A and B viruses, and HMPV). The comparison of rates of HBoV detection in the current study therefore requires preselection of subsets of the data obtained.",

The overall prevalence of 1.1% (18 of 1019 samples were positive) in the Canadian study was not strictly comparable with our data, because a greater proportion of samples were collected from adult patients [7] , with !25% of the samples obtained from children !5 years of age, compared with 62% in the current study.

In the French study [8] , the overall frequency of HBoV (9 [3.4%] of 263 samples were positive) among children !5 years of age who had samples collected between November and January was similarly 4 times lower than the frequency of 14% (32 of 245 samples were positive) in the matching subset of samples from Edinburgh.

The increased rate of detection may have resulted from differences in the frequencies of HBoV infection in different parts of the world, as well as from different seasonal associations. However, all of the other studies involved the use of PCR assays with a singleround PCR rather than the potentially more-sensitive nested screening and confi matory PCR methods developed in the current study. Because assay sensitivity was not determined in any of the previously published studies, and because a nonoptimized single-round PCR with a relatively large amplicon size would be unlikely to achieve the sensitivity of nested PCR, it is therefore probable that a proportion of HBoV-positive samples were missed in the earlier studies. Clearly, standardization of assay sensitivity will be important for comparative epidemiological studies in the future.",

However, the markedly increased frequencies of detection of HBoV in samples referred to the SVL in December and January were consistent with the peak incidence of HBoV infection in winter described in Australia [5] and Sweden [3] . However, estimates of seasonal prevalence are complicated by the marked differences in the number of sample referrals between summer and winter, coinciding with changes in the incidence of respiratory disease. Indeed, the actual frequencies of HBoV detection per sample may be similar throughout the year. For example, dividing the year into 2 periods (April-September and October-March) yields a frequency of HBoV detection of 3.5% (3 of 85 samples were positive) in the summer in Stockholm, which is similar to the frequency of 3.1% noted in winter (14 of 455 samples were positive) [3] . A similarly constant frequency of detection on a per-sample basis was reported from Canada (8 of 617 samples obtained in summer were positive, and 10 of 592 samples obtained in winter were positive [7] ). However, although not indicated in the latter study, monthly totals of samples were clearly adjusted to \u223c50 samples and did not reflec seasonal changes in the numbers of samples referred. Overall, the published data indicating a constant rate of HBoV detection in respiratory samples, irrespective of season, do not distinguish between HBoV being an incidental findin or being associated with seasonal respiratory disease. However, our own data documenting marked changes in rates of HBoV infection even within the 5-month study period (figu e 1A) provide the firs evidence of a seasonal epidemiological profil that is similar to that of RSV, distinct from that of other respiratory viruses, and independent of sample referral numbers.",

The additional obser-.00008 vation that the frequency of HBoV infection was higher when another virus was present (table 2) suggests the interesting possibility that HBoV infection may be an exacerbating factor, particularly for RSV infections, with which it has frequently been associated in the present study and in other studies. Coinfections leading to more severe disease have been described for HMPV and RSV [14] and for RSV and coronaviruses with other respiratory pathogens [15] . It is possible that HBoV may similarly increase the severity of RSV and other viruses causing LRTIs, which may be particularly well represented in the current study group. Because of the nature of the diagnostic testing performed, the study group contains a large proportion of individuals with respiratory infections severe enough to require hospitalization. Investigation of the epidemiological profil of HBoV infections among other groups with less severe respiratory infections not requiring clinical referral would clearly be of value.",

Diagnosis of HBoV may turn out to be clinically important, not least because it potentially differentiates a substantial proportion of LRTIs caused by HBoV from those caused by RSV for which specifi antiviral treatments are available. In summary, the present study documents frequent infections with the newly discovered parvovirus HBoV, but not with PARV4, in young children during the winter months in the United Kingdom, with HBoV having a prevalence, epidemiological profile and association with LRTIs comparable to those of RSV, which is the main respiratory pathogen in young children.",
