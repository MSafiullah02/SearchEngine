The surface of the AAV capsid is an essential component that is involved in cell binding, internalization, and trafficking within the targeted cell. Prior to developing a gene therapy strategy that utilizes AAV, the serotype should be carefully considered since each capsid exhibits a unique tissue tropism and transduction efficiency. Several approaches have been undertaken in an effort to target AAV vectors to specific cell types, including utilizing natural serotypes that target a desired cellular receptor, producing pseudotyped vectors, and engineering chimeric and mosaic AAV capsids. These capsid modifications are being incorporated into vector production and purification methods that provide for the ability to scale-up the manufacturing process to support human clinical trials.

AAV is a member of the family Parvoviridae, genus Dependovirus. Several features of AAVs that make them promising candidates as gene transfer vectors are as follows: (1) Good safety profile: the members of this genus are not associated with disease in humans. The virus is replication-deficient, and, except under special circumstances, it will not replicate or spread [1] , and AAV has been well tolerated in human clinical trials. (2) Stable long-term expression of the transgene: AAV has successfully been used to express transgenes in several tissues, including brain, muscle, liver, lung, vascular endothelium, and hematopoietic cells [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . (3) Ability to transduce dividing and nondividing cells [10] . (4) Episomal maintenance: wild-type AAV exhibits site-specific integration of its genome into chromosome 19; however, the majority of vector genomes appear to be maintained episomally [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, the risk of integration is minimal, compared with retroviral vectors that require integration into the host genome and have the potential to activate proto-oncogenes. (5) Low immunogenicity: unlike adenoviral vectors, a robust T cell response to the vector is not generated by AAV [14] , although humoral immune responses are generated, which may result in viral neutralization [15] . The use of other AAV serotypes may circumvent this response and allow for repeated treatments [16] . Alternatively, immunosuppressive therapy may be used during treatment with AAV to avoid the immune response [17] . (6) Physiochemical stability: AAV virions are highly stable over a wide range of pH and temperature, a feature that is important for production and purification methods for clinical-grade AAV vectors, as well as for stability of the final vector product [18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 493, "end": 496, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 764, "end": 767, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 776, "end": 779, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 780, "end": 783, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 784, "end": 787, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 788, "end": 791, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 792, "end": 795, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 854, "end": 858, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1049, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1059, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1358, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1455, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1556, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1667, "end": 1671, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1677, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1928, "end": 1932, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The genome of AAV is \u223c4,700 bases of linear, single-stranded DNA. There are two genes, rep and cap, which are flanked by the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). The ITRs consist of 145 nucleotides, which form a characteristic T-shaped hairpin. These are the only sequences required in cis for viral DNA replication and packaging. The rep gene encodes four nonstructural proteins, Rep78, Rep68, Rep52, and Rep40, which play a role in viral genome replication and transcription, as well as packaging. Rep78 and Rep68 are translated from mRNAs transcribed from the p5 promoter, while Rep52 and Rep 40 are derived from mRNAs transcribed from the p19 promoter. Alternative splicing replaces a 92 amino acid C-terminal element in Rep78 and Rep52 with a 9 amino acid element in Rep68 and Rep40 [19] . The cap gene encodes the three structural proteins of the AAV capsid, VP1 (87 kDa), VP2 (72 kDa), and VP3 (63 kDa), translated from mRNA transcribed from the p40 promoter. Differential splicing yields major and minor spliced products. VP1 is translated from the minor spliced mRNA, yielding less VP1 protein. VP2 and VP3 are both translated from the more abundant major spliced mRNA; however, VP2 is translated less efficiently because it initiates at an ACG codon, while VP3 is translated very efficiently because of a favorable Kozak context [20] . As a result, the AAV capsid proteins, which differ only in their N-terminal region, are present in the mature virion in a ratio of 1:1:10 (VP1:VP2:VP3).

Pulse-chase experiments showed that empty particles rapidly accumulate (10-20 min), but that mature \"full\" virions accumulated more slowly (4-8 h) . They also showed that the number of empty viral particles decreases at the same rate as the number of DNA-containing mature virions increases during the course of infection. Additionally, de la Maza and Carter showed that DI particles, particles with deletions in the AAV genome, are packaged into apparently normal capsids, indicating that full-length viral genomic DNA is not required for the assembly or structural integrity of the AAV capsid [22] . In the absence of capsid assembly, ssDNA does not accumulate, further suggesting that empty capsids form first. Interactions between the preformed AAV capsid and Rep52 provides a mechanism where the nonstructural protein's helicase activity inserts the viral DNA [23] . Within the cell, capsid assembly occurs at centers within the nucleus where there is colocalization of Rep proteins, capsid proteins, and DNA [24] . Empty AAV capsids can be produced by expressing the AAV cap gene in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system [25] or in mammalian cells utilizing a recombinant adenovirus expressing the AAV capsid proteins. These systems have advanced the structural studies of the AAV capsid as a result of the large amount of empty capsids or virus-like particles (VLPs) that can be produced. Studies of AAV assembly have demonstrated that VP3 alone is sufficient to form VLPs [26] , but VP1 is required for infectivity [27] . Subsequently, it was shown that the unique N-terminus of VP1 has phospholipase A2 activity and contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) [28] . The N-terminus of VP2 also has a NLS and may play a role in transporting VP3 into the nucleus; however, it has been shown that the N-terminus of VP2 is nonessential and that infectious virus can be produced that lack VP2 entirely [29] . Additionally, the N-terminus of VP2 has been replaced with green fluorescent protein and these capsids still assemble and maintain infectivity. This demonstrates that VP2 can tolerate peptide insertions and may be useful for incorporating peptides into the capsid for cell-specific targeting of AAV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 183, "end": 187, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 329, "end": 336, "text": "(4-8 h)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 785, "end": 789, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1059, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1208, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1334, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1687, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1730, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1873, "end": 1877, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2110, "end": 2114, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Capsid Assembly and Packaging"}, {"text": "The adeno-associated virus capsid is \u223c25 nm in diameter and is composed of 60 subunits arranged in T = 1 icosahedral symmetry. Because AAV has a number of features that make it attractive as a gene transfer vector, many studies have focused on the basic biology of the virus, including studies that address the structural characteristics. Cryo-EM or crystal structures for AAV2, AAV4, and AAV5 have been determined [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , and the crystal structure for AAV8 is currently in progress [35] . Dependoviruses share the same subunit fold as the other members of the family Parvoviridae, including the insect densoviruses, and the autonomously replicating parvoviruses such as canine parvovirus (CPV) and minute virus of mice (MVM), even though AAV shares low capsid primary sequence identity (7-22%) [36] [37] [38] . The monomeric subunit of AAV has a conserved \u03b2-barrel core that is common in viral capsid proteins. Figure 2 .2 depicts the structure of a monomeric subunit of AAV2 as determined by Xie et al. [31] . The motif is an eight-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-barrel motif (jelly-roll \u03b2-barrel), with the \u03b2 strands labeled B-I [36] . The \u03b2-strand labeled A is present in some parvoviruses, including AAV. Not surprisingly, genetic capsid mutants of AAV2 in the conserved core \u03b2-barrel, such as mut19 (\u03b2A mutation), mut20 (\u03b2B mutation), mut25 (\u03b2D mutation), and mut46 (\u03b2I mutation), are unable to assemble into capsids [40] . AAV has long loop insertions between the strands of the core \u03b2-barrel that are labeled according to the \u03b2 strands that they flank. These long interstrand loops contain \u03b2 ribbons and elements of secondary structure that form much of the outer surface features of the AAV capsid. The GH loop is the longest interstrand loop, and three VPs interact extensively at each three-fold axis of symmetry, forming a prominent spike. Five DE loops each form an antiparallel \u03b2 ribbon at the five-fold axis of symmetry that results in a cylindrical structure surrounding a canyon-like depression. At the two-fold axis of symmetry there is a small depression, often referred to as the two-fold dimple [41, 42] . Analysis of newly discovered AAV genotypes identified a total of 12 hypervariable regions on the AAV capsid [43] . Overlaying these regions onto the X-ray crystallographic model of AAV2 showed that these regions are exposed on the capsid surface. Most of the variability is located between the G and H \u03b2 strands, which are implicated in the formation of the valley and the peaks of the protruding three-fold axis of symmetry. These surface features of the virus are responsible for the interactions of the capsid with cellular receptors, as well as antibodies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 419, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 420, "end": 424, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 425, "end": 429, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 430, "end": 434, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 435, "end": 439, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 502, "end": 506, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 814, "end": 818, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 819, "end": 823, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 824, "end": 828, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1028, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1148, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1439, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2132, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2136, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2247, "end": 2251, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 931, "end": 939, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Capsid Structure"}, {"text": "Motifs on the capsid surface are critical for attachment to the host cell, which is the first step required for infection.

These new variants may provide expanded tropism and unique cellular targets for AAV-mediated gene delivery. Utilizing the natural differences in tropism of the AAV serotypes provides one strategy to efficiently deliver AAV vectors to specific target tissues, and selecting the appropriate capsid serotype for the target tissue is an important consideration. The rAAV genome can be packaged into capsids of its own serotype, \"isotype,\" or alternatively the rAAV genome can be \"cross-packaged\" into capsids derived from another serotype, a process called pseudotyping [57] [58] [59] . For pseudotyped vectors, the capsid gene of each serotype can be cloned with AAV2 rep, and the transgene is flanked by ITRs of AAV2. The resulting vector has a capsid of some serotype other than AAV2 and the packaged transgene flanked by the ITRs of AAV2. This provides a method to compare the transduction efficiency of various serotypes and the ability to choose the most efficient one for the specific application [58] . Table 2 .1 lists several target tissues and the comparative transduction efficiency of selected AAV serotypes studied in animal models. Efficient transduction could involve cell entry associated with receptor binding and internalization, or post-entry events such as cellular processing pathways, intracellular transport, nuclear entry, or processing of virions and vector genomes.

In mice, the AAV8 capsid amino acids 126-140 elicited a Th1 response, whereas a Th2 response was elicited by AAV2 amino acids 475-489. The magnitude of the immune response depends on several factors, including vector dose, as well as the route and site of administration. Antibodies formed after transduction with one AAV serotype are likely to show only weak interaction with other serotypes, or may not cross-react. In animals that are transduced with AAV6 and then transduced with AAV2, delivery of the transgene was not hampered; however, animals transduced with AAV2 and then retransduced with AAV2 developed a neutralizing antibody response [92] . The region of the AAV2 capsid that has been shown to be responsible for generating a CD8 + T cell response is the RXXR motif in VP1, VP2, and VP3, which is involved in heparin binding for AAV2. This region was identified as being involved in uptake into dendritic cells, as well as the activation of capsid-specific T cells [94] . Alternative serotypes may also provide for treating cells that have heretofore been refractory to AAV infection, such as stem cells. It has been demonstrated that AAV2 is not efficient at transducing hematopoietic stem cells because of suboptimal levels of expression of the cell surface receptor for the viral vector (HSPG), impaired cellular trafficking of the vector, inefficient vector uncoating, and the lack of viral second-strand DNA synthesis [7] . However, AAV1 is able to transduce hemotopoietic stem/progenitor cells when evaluated in shortterm colony assays, as well as in long-term bone marrow transplantation assays in vivo [73] . There is also a low transduction efficiency for AAV2 in the airway epithelium of the lung due to a low abundance of HSPG on the apical surface; however, sialic acid is an abundant sugar on the apical surface of airway epithelium and pseudotyped AAV5 and AAV6 vectors have been shown to be efficient at gene transfer to murine airway epithelia in vivo [95, 96] . Encapsidated AAV6 vectors achieve transduction rates that should be sufficient for treating lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Recently, it was determined that the transduction efficiency of rAAV2 for the in vivo treatment of pancreatic and colon carcinoma is insufficient; however, other AAV serotypes, which have not yet been tested, may result in better transduction of this target tissue [97] . AAV2 and AAV1 bind to different cellular receptors, resulting in better transduction of muscle tissue for AAV1, and since the vectors in these studies contained the same cis elements, the AAV capsid is responsible for the differences in transduction efficiency between serotypes [98, 99] . Hauck and Xiao produced a series of capsid mutants to investigate the major regions of the AAV1 capsid responsible for the increased transduction efficiency of AAV1 in muscle tissue [100] ; the major tissue tropism determinants were located in the surface region of VP1 (amino acid 350-423). Similar functional studies of the AAV capsid will provide a better understanding of the surface features and the specific requirements for engineering AAV capsids to efficiently target specific cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 5, "end": 9, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 10, "end": 14, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 15, "end": 19, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 20, "end": 24, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 25, "end": 29, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 30, "end": 34, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 35, "end": 39, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 40, "end": 44, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 45, "end": 49, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 101, "end": 105, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 755, "end": 759, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1090, "text": "[94]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1547, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1735, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2093, "text": "[95,", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2097, "text": "96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2506, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 2788, "end": 2792, "text": "[98,", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 2793, "end": 2796, "text": "99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 2981, "end": 2986, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Serotypes"}, {"text": "A receptor, like HSPG, which is present on a variety of cell types poses difficulties for targeting AAV2 vectors to a specific tissue. One approach to limiting gene expression in the target tissue is to utilize a viral vector that harbors a tissue-specific promoter [4, 72, 101] . Genetic modifications of the AAV capsid also provide an alternative approach for retargeting AAV2. Regions of the capsid have been identified that will accept insertion of heterologous peptides for retargeting. Girod et al., first demonstrated that the insertion of a 14 amino acid integrin binding peptide at amino acid 587 allowed for retargeting of AAV2 [102] . To obtain a genetic map of the AAV2 capsid, Wu et al. constructed alanine scanning mutants at 59 different positions in the AAV capsid gene by site-directed mutagenesis [103] . Studies of these mutants showed that the capsid can tolerate some modifications and still maintain infectivity. A 34 amino acid IgG binding domain was inserted into rAAV2 capsids at amino acid 587, and this, coupled with antibodies against B1 integrin, CXCR4, or the c-kit receptor, mediated the targeting of these rAAV vectors to specific cell surface receptors [104] . Endothelial cell binding peptides were identified using phage display and inserted into the AAV2 capsid at amino acid 587 to transduce venous endothelial cells and significantly reduce hepatocyte transduction [105] . Recently, it was demonstrated that AAV2 could be retargeted to the heart utilizing a capsid with mutations at amino acids 484 and 585 to eliminate heparin binding, which is required for AAV2 to infect the liver [106] . Perabo et al. also demonstrated that insertion at amino acid 587 with peptides that confer a net negative charge will ablate binding to HSPG, and this correlated with liver and spleen detargeting for AAV2. Insertion of peptides between 585 and 588 can either cause spatial separation or sterically block heparin binding of AAV2 (using bulky amino acids), and the insertion of positively charged peptides reconstitutes the ability to bind HSPG [107] . This provides a strategy to improve AAV targeting in other tissues. For retargeting AAV to tumor cells, an RGD-4C motif can be inserted at amino acids 520 and 584, or 588 to confer a novel tropism and eliminate heparin binding. The RGD motif binds the cellular integrin receptor, which is expressed on tumor cells, including ovarian cancer cells, but these cells express only low levels of HSPG and are nonpermissive for AAV2 transduction [108, 109] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 266, "end": 269, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 270, "end": 273, "text": "72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 274, "end": 278, "text": "101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 492, "end": 505, "text": "Girod et al.,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 638, "end": 643, "text": "[102]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 815, "end": 820, "text": "[103]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1191, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1408, "text": "[105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1622, "end": 1627, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1648, "text": "Perabo et al. also", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2078, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 2520, "end": 2525, "text": "[108,", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2530, "text": "109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Retargeting"}, {"text": "Introduction of a peptide into the AAV2 capsid is a viable strategy for retargeting AAV2 to additional cell types; however, modifications in the AAV2 capsid often result in a reduction in vector yields, especially if the insertion is large. The unique N-terminal region of VP2 allows for peptide insertions without a loss of titer, when VP1 and VP3 are supplied in trans. AAV2 mosaics that have ligand insertions in a subset of VP1, VP2, and VP3 molecules result in increased vector yields and transducing titers, compared with viruses that carry the insertion in all 60 capsid protein subunits [110] . Insertion of an HA epitope (YPVDVPDYA) at amino acid 522 or 533 of VP1 results in noninfectious particles [103] ; however, the inclusion of wildtype capsid proteins can restore viral infectivity. Ried et al. [104] inserted an immunoglobulin-binding fragment of protein A (Z34C) that resulted in at least a tenfold reduction in particle titers, most likely due to its large size (34 amino acids). Compared with wild-type virus, infectious titers were 4 orders of magnitude lower. Gigout et al. generated mosaic viruses that contained between 25 and 75% of Z34C capsid proteins, with the rest of the capsid being composed of wild-type subunits to produce AAV2 mosaics that were infectious. Compared with wild-type virus, the Z34C mosaics showed up to a tenfold increase in titer, and those containing 25% Z34C capsid protein (an average of 15 subunits per capsid) were 4-5 orders of magnitude more infectious than all mutant viruses. By mutating R585 and R588 to alanine, they were able to eliminate HSPG binding and then the insertion of Z34C resulted in retargeting of AAV2 [110] . This work demonstrated for the first time that a combined approach of generating AAV2 mosaics to alter tropism and mutating two residues to reduce HSPG binding could be used to retarget AAV2 to specific cell types. For AAV1, incorporating an RGD4C motif in VP1 at amino acid 590 enables targeting to integrin receptors which are present on vascular endothelial cells [111] . It is also possible to incorporate a small biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) in this position for the purpose of metabolically biotinylating the AAV1 capsid for purification using a commercially available avidin affinity column.

This is accomplished by supplying the capsid gene from two distinct AAV serotypes during production. By varying the ratio of the two capsid genes, the resulting mixed virus may exhibit altered tropism. Rabinowitz et al. showed that mixed capsids of AAV2/5 at a ratio of 3:1 resulted in a loss of heparin binding. The ability of these virions to transduce HeLa cells, which have high levels of heparin sulfate, decreased, while the ability to transduce the heparin-sulfatedeficient cell line CHO pgsD increased from 2% to > 30% as the composition of the virion changed from AAV2-like to AAV5-like. Chimeras also may show combined tropism of both serotypes, broadening the tropism for these virions. Kohlbrenner et al. utilized chimeric capsids to improve infectivity when expressing AAV5 and AAV8 in insect cells [113] . It was determined that AAV5 and AAV8 vectors generated using the baculovirus system had low infectivity, which was due to insufficient phospholipase A2 activity. Substituting the entire VP1 protein from AAV2 in chimeric AAV5 or AAV8 capsids resulted in increased phospholipase activity levels and enhanced transduction. Generating chimeras also provides a method to functionally define structural relatedness for newly discovered serotypes. The ability to generate stable chimeric capsids suggests that the subunits from these different serotypes are structurally compatible. Conversely, AAV2 when mixed with AAV4 inefficiently packages genomes. The inability to generate stable virions may reflect a failure of essential structural subunit interactions at one or more axes of symmetry. Alternatively, the nonstructural Rep protein interactions that occur on the surface of the capsid for packaging may not be compatible in the AAV2/AAV4 chimeras, as suggested by the structures for AAV2 and AAV4 [30, 31] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 93, "end": 98, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 303, "end": 320, "text": "Rabinowitz et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 913, "end": 918, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1922, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1923, "end": 1926, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Capsid Chimeras"}, {"text": "The AAV capsid provides a potent gene delivery vehicle and has shown great promise in animal models, as well as in human clinical trials conducted to date.

Improvements in production and purification methods have resulted in better yields, increased purity, and higher titers through the development of scalable systems [113, [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] . Recombinant AAV vectors can be manufactured using a two-plasmid system, as shown in Fig. 2. 3. One plasmid harbors the therapeutic Vector expressing adiponectin Rat AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5 [180] gene flanked by the ITRs and the other one contains the AAV rep and cap genes, as well as the helper functions for AAV2 replication. The adenovirus helper functions are provided by expression of E2A, E4ORF6, and VA RNAs in the helper plasmid, while the adenovirus E1A and E1B gene products are expressed in the HEK293 cells utilized for production [188] . The two plasmids are co-transfected into 293 cells, and this results in production of an AAV virion that contains the therapeutic gene flanked by the ITRs [189] . The ITRs are the only viral sequences remaining after purification of rAAV vectors. Protocol 1 (see Appendix) describes the small-scale production and purification of rAAV vectors as described by Zolotukhin et al. [190] . Generally, HEK293 cells are expanded, transfected, and harvested at 72 h post-transfection. The cells are then lysed, and loaded onto either a cesium chloride or an iodixanol gradient to separate infectious virions from empty capsids and other cellular proteins. Virus is then purified using either heparin affinity chromatography or ion-exchange chromatography. The chromatography method used is dependent on the natural receptors for AAV, as well as the charge characteristics of the viral particle, as shown in Fig. 2 .4. Following column chromatography, the virus is concentrated and characterized. These protocols yield vector stocks that are relatively pure; however, owing to the density gradient requirement, these methods are not easily scalable. Protocols 2 and 3 describe the large-scale production and purification of rAAV vectors as described by Snyder et al. [18] . Protocol 3 provides a method suitable for large-scale production of rAAV2 vectors that is scalable for the production of vectors under cGMP conditions for clinical trials [191] . Cell factories of HEK293 cells are transfected, incubated for 72 h, and then harvested. The cell pellet is resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholate to reduce viral particle aggregation and 50 U Benzonase/ml to degrade cellular, plasmid, and nonpackaged nucleic acid. A microfluidizer is utilized to lyse the cells in order to form a fine suspension that can be loaded directly onto a Streamline Heparin column. The column is washed and the virus is eluted from the column with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2 M NaCl (for a total ionic strength of 350 mM).

In vitro, upon heat treatment of AAV capsids, it has been shown that this region can be externalized. Mutagenesis experiments have shown that this externalization occurs through the pore at the five-fold axis of symmetry [199] . Previously, antibodies have been produced that detect various regions of the capsid proteins [200] . The B1 antibody epitope is on the C-terminal end of the capsid protein, and is primarily internal at the two-fold axis of symmetry in assembled capsids. This antibody is useful in detecting denatured AAV proteins and the epitope is highly conserved among the AAV serotypes. A1 antibody recognizes the unique N-terminal region of VP1, while the A69 epitope is in the N-terminal region of VP2 for AAV2. Polyclonal antibodies have been produced to AAV2 capsids, as well as to other serotypes. In addition, antibodies have been produced that recognize conformational epitopes that are present only on assembled capsids for AAV2, as well as AAV1. Capsid antibodies can be utilized for serotype identity testing of the final vector product; however, many of these antibodies cross-react with multiple serotypes. Historically, AAV has been shown to be remarkably stable and is generally resistant to proteases. However, we have demonstrated that when exposed to proteases, specific regions of the capsid are susceptible to proteolysis [201] . Owing to differences in the primary sequence of the capsid proteins of different serotypes, as well as the resulting differences in capsid structure, proteolysis can be utilized for AAV serotype determination. Different serotypes provide unique fragmentation patterns when cleaved with protease, with some serotypes such as AAV5 being relatively resistant, while others such as AAV2 are more susceptible to trypsin and chymotrypsin. Figure 2 .5 depicts protease mapping of the AAV capsid for capsid serotype determination. A generic assay is described in Protocol 4 where proteolysis is used together with specific antibodies to provide a powerful mapping technique and a method to identify and confirm the serotype of the AAV capsid.

Several approaches are available to target AAV viral vectors to specific cell types, including utilizing natural serotypes that target a desired cellular receptor, producing pseudotyped vectors, as well as engineering chimeric and mosaic capsids. Genetic mutations of the AAV capsid have identified regions that will accommodate peptide insertions and modifications for specific targeting. The use of modified capsids may enhance efficiency and target specificity to make a more potent and safe vector. Several genetic diseases are amenable to treatment with AAV vectors, making AAV a valuable gene delivery vehicle, especially for disorders for which current therapies are inadequate or non-existent.
