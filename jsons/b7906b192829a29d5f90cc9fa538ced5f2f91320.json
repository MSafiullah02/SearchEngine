No differences between cases and controls were found for education, occupation, types of residence, bathing, sanitary or drinking facilities, and nature of house construction or heating. Detailed dietary histories, available for half the subjects, revealed no difference, cases versus controls, for four age periods between age 0 and 30 years, and for 16 specified foodstuffs. Animal exposures showed overall no consistent differences by location or type of animal. There was a tendency to greater exposure to British troops during the war for cases versus Groups A and B, but this did not attain statistical significance. Vaccinations for smallpox, tetanus and diphtheria were less common in the MS; no difference was found for other vaccinations. Except for a relative deficit in the cases for rubella and (insignificantly) for measles, mumps and chicken pox, reported illnesses were equally common among all groups. Operations, hospitalizations and injuries did not differentiate the groups, nor did age at menarche for women. Neurologic symptoms were significantly more common in the cases than in the controls.",

We attributed the introduction of the disorder to occupation of the Faroes by British troops for 5 years during World War 11. In our view, the British introduced an unknown infection, which we have called the primary MS affection (PMSA), to the susceptible part of the exposed Faroese population cohort, those aged 11-45 years in 1941. Part of this affected cohort transmitted PMSA to the next cohort of Faroese formed by those attaining age 11 during the interval when the first cohort was transmissible. The second cohort in like manner transmitted PMSA to a third, and the third cohort to a fourth. Clinical neurologic MS (CNMS) is considered the late rare result of infection with PMSA. PMSA is transmissible; CNMS is not.",

Table 1 displays the subject groups who had questionnaires administered (a), blood drawn for HLA and other blood group typing (B), and serum therefrom processed for antibody testing (S). Blood grouping data have been presented (5). Serologic results will follow separately. Questionnaires were completed by 15 of the 17 living MS patients then known to us and by knowledgeable relatives of 8 of the 11 patients then dead; 2 of these 3 latter deceased had had questionnaires too incomplete to be assessed, and they were discarded. About two thirds of the patients (and their controls) were members of the first epidemic (1) and the rest of later ones (2, 3). Proportions within each control group were quite similar for each epidemic subdivision. Accordingly, in the analysis of the questionnaires, all subjects were combined, regardless of epidemic. Type of control is largely self-apparent. A \"neighbor control\" was the nearest neighbor of the same sex and approximate age as the matched MS patient. \"Distant controls\" were subjects of the same sex and age as their MS match, but who lived in villages where there were never residents with MS and where British troops were not stationed during the war. Except for the patients, siblings and other relatives were limited to those living in the same house as the index control. Data for children of cases and controls have not been analyzed.",

Virtually all of the identified cases participated in the survey. Neighborhood and family controls provided an efficient source for information. The number of cases and controls gave sufficient power to avoid a major ?lype I1 error. Two-tailed tests were expected to (and did) show significant differences with odds ratios of about 2. Such a ratio would be found if patients differed from control percentages by only some 17% or less, depending on the proportions positive. Lesser discrepancies would not seem likely to have much biologic meaning. Furthermore, the fact that most study characteristics were similar in each control group (A, B, C) compared with cases makes selection bias an unlikely explanation for the observed differences. Overall, the Faroe Islands provide an ideal setting to study not only occurrence but also risk factors for a relatively uncommon disease like MS. Exposure to British troops is significantly associated with developing MS through what we believe to be an as yet unidentified infection we call PMSA. An update of the cases and a more extensive evaluation of infections using serum and further surveys may better clarify the nature of PMSA.",
