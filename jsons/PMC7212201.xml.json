Varicella is the primary VZV infection and it occurs most frequently in children. Herpes zoster occurs mainly in adults or immunocompromised hosts as a consequence of latent VZV reactivation.\n1\n VZV is a member of the human herpesvirus family encoding five major glycoproteins designated gpI\u2013gpV.\n2\n Glycoproteins are critical factors for VZV entry and replication. Thus, they are attractive targets for antiviral drug development.\n3\n VZV gE among VZV glycoproteins is the most abundant and immunogenic. It participates in viral replication and cell\u2010cell transmission. Moreover, it contains B\u2010cell and CD4+ T\u2010cell epitopes and elicits complement\u2010dependent neutralizing antibodies and cell\u2010mediated immunity.\n4\n VZV\u2010specific CD4+ T cells synthesize Th1\u2010like cytokines such as interleukin\u20102 (IL\u20102) and interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3). They induce major histocompatibility complex class II\u2010restricted cytotoxicity.\n5\n, \n6\n Therefore, CD4+ T cells expressing IL\u20102 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 were selected as immune markers to evaluate cell\u2010mediated immune responses to VZV vaccines.\n4\n, \n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n VZV gE is an attractive candidate for the development of VZV subunit vaccines because the VZV gE antigen, also known as CD4+ T\u2010cell antigen, is capable of inducing both humoral and cell\u2010mediated immune responses.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n\n",

The herpes zoster LAVs, Zostavax (Merck & Co., Inc., Darmstadt, Germany) and SKYZoster (SK Bioscience Co Ltd, Andong, Korea), have been licensed. LAV has preventive efficacy against varicella in the range of 70% to 96%. In contrast, its preventive efficacy against herpes zoster is only ~60%.\n15\n LAV promotes relatively lower VZV\u2010specific cellular immune responses against herpes zoster in older patients as immunosenescence accompanies the aging process. Immunosenescence is characterized by decreased T\u2010cell numbers and impaired T\u2010cell function.\n16\n A subunit vaccine comprising VZV gE and the liposome\u2010based adjuvant Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) was licensed in 2017. Its reported efficacy against herpes zoster was 97%.\n15\n Therefore, the subunit vaccine may have greater efficacy against herpes zoster than LAV. A recombinant subunit vaccine is a potential alternative to live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine. However, the low immunogenicity of individual viral proteins may have to be enhanced with adjuvants.\n17\n\n",

All new adjuvants should be compared with the gold\u2010standard aluminum\u2010based adjuvants (alum). Alum has been used to increase vaccine formulation efficacy for >90 years.\n19\n However, there are still limitations of alum that require supplementation to boost vaccine efficacy. For example, alum typically induces a Th2 response, which mediates the differentiation of B cells that secrete Th2\u2010cell\u2010associated antibody isotypes, as opposed to inducing a very low Th1 response that is required to activate innate immune response,\n20\n, \n21\n as a prerequisite to guarantee a more effective and/or long\u2010term immune response.\n22\n The ideal adjuvant induces innate immune responses, thereby activating adaptive immune responses.\n23\n, \n24\n Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) agonists and oil\u2010in\u2010water emulsions have been developed to complement alum adjuvants.\n25\n, \n26\n Our new candidate adjuvant is a single\u2010strand RNA (ssRNA) derived from the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) intergenic region (IGR) of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). It induces balanced Th1/Th2 responses, enhances innate immune response, and increases vaccine efficacy.\n27\n\n",

In VZV\u2010primed mice, we assessed whether this ssRNA adjuvant induces humoral\u2010 and cell\u2010mediated immunity in the VZV gE subunit vaccine. Adjuvants are not usually included in LAV formulations. However, we used guinea pigs to evaluate the ability of the ssRNA adjuvant to enhance neutralizing antibody production and cell\u2010mediated immune response in VZV LAV. Based on all results, we showed the potential of ssRNA adjuvants to compensate for the limitations of protein\u2010based vaccines with respect to low T\u2010cell activity and short\u2010term responses, as well as to increase the neutralizing antibody in LAV for preventing VZV\u2010induced disease.",
