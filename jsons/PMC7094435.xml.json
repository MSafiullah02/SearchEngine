The laser light sheet (green; wavelength, 532 nm; continuous-wave mode) was adjusted to encompass the largest cross-section of the entire leakage jet plume through the nebulizer side vents along the coronal plane lateral to the HPS. This allowed us to investigate the regions directly above and lateral to the mask and the patient. All leakage jet plume images revealed by the laser light sheet were captured by the high-definition video camera positioned at the end of the bed directly opposite to the HPS. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles (Fig 2\n).8, 9, 10\n",

The leakage plume of \u201cunused\u201d aerosolized medications from the jet nebulizer should also be considered as infective because it mixes with the exhaled air before it escapes through the side vents of the nebulizer mask. As the smoke particles mark air that originates from the HPS airways, before leaking from the mask, the concentration contours effectively represent the probability of encountering exhaled air and the aerosolized medication around the patient that has come from within the mask and/or the patient's respiratory system. The smoke concentration contours are made up of data collected from 10 breaths. A contour value of 1 indicates a region that consists entirely of air exhaled by the patient, where there is a very high chance of exposure to the exhaled air, such as at the mask exhaust vents. A value near 0 indicates no measurable air leakage in the region and a small chance of exposure to the exhaled air.8, 9, 10 The study received nonionizing radiation and biological/chemical safety approval by the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",

            "text": "In severe lung injury (oxygen consumption, 500 mL/min; lung compliance, 10 mL/cm H2O; respiratory rate, 40 breaths/min; tidal volume, 150 mL), a larger and more diffuse exhalation jet leaked through the side vents of the nebulizer mask was noted, probably due to its gravitational effect. Although the exhalation distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (eg, red zone on scale) was < 0.1 m, the maximum dispersion distance extended beyond 0.8 m due to more extensive leakage through the nebulizer side vents (Fig 3, bottom right).",

            "text": "With an extremely fine smoke particle tracer in order to demonstrate the maximum distribution of exhaled air, this study investigated the dispersion distances of exhaled air particles during application of a jet nebulizer under normal lung condition vs different degrees of lung injury in our hospital isolation room with negative pressure. Using laser smoke visualization methods, we have shown that the maximum dispersion distance of a low concentration of air particles increased from 0.45 m at normal lung condition to 0.54 m and beyond 0.8 m during mild and severe lung injury, respectively. Interestingly, the dispersion of high-concentration smoke particles was reduced with worsening lung injury. These data suggest that the dispersion of exhaled air during application of jet nebulizer is determined by both the expiratory effort and the leakage of \u201cunused\u201d aerosolized droplets through the exhalation ports of the jet nebulizer. In this regard, exhaled air from the lungs contained high concentration of smoke particles and was dispersed according to expiratory flow. Therefore, the dispersion distance of high-concentration smoke particles was significantly reduced by > 40% as the tidal volume was decreased from 700 to 150 mL. In contrast, the extent of leakage of aerosolized droplets was inversely proportional to the tidal volume. Although aerosol deposition within the simulated patient does not model deposition within a real lung, much of the aerosolized medication was deposited within the simulated patient during inspiration, and the amount of leakage was therefore less in normal lung condition than in the severe lung injury model. Although the leakage of aerosolized droplets carried only small amount of exhaled smoke particles, these were responsible for dispersing low-concentration smoke particles to a longer distance in severe lung injury. These findings have important clinical implications to the health-care workers who often manage patients with respiratory failure and febrile illness of unknown etiology at a close distance. It is important to provide adequate respiratory protection for health-care workers in addition to applying standard, contact, and droplet precautions in order to prevent nosocomial infections.",

In a study27 of the dispersion characteristics of polydispersed droplets in a general hospital ward equipped with ceiling-mixing type ventilation system, the small droplets or droplet nuclei (initial size \u2264 45 \u03bcm) behaved as airborne transmittable particles (staying airborne for > 360 s) and the dispersions were strongly affected by the ward ventilation airflow pattern.

All leakage jet plume images revealed by the laser light sheet were captured by a high-definition video camera positioned at the end of the bed directly opposite to the simulator. The X-axis represents the distance lateral to the center of the nebulizer mask, and the Y-axis represents the vertical distance from the center of the mask. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles by computer analysis. Top right: The simulator was programmed to mimic normal lung condition, with oxygen consumption set at 200 mL/min and lung compliance at 70 mL/cm H2O. Average respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min, and tidal volume was 700 mL. The maximum dispersion distance of a low concentration (light blue zone on the smoke concentration scale) of smoke particles was 0.45 m, whereas that of a high concentration (red zone and above) was 0.2 m lateral to the simulator. The white color code and the red color code represented regions consisting of 100% and 70%, respectively, of smoke particles, whereas the background of the isolation room (deep blue code) was free of smoke particles. Bottom left: The simulator was programmed to mimic mild lung injury with oxygen consumption of 300 mL/min, lung compliance of 35 mL/cm H2O, respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min, and tidal volume of 300 mL. The maximum exhalation distance of a low concentration of smoke particles increased to 0.54 m, whereas that of a high concentration was 0.15 m. Bottom right: The simulator was programmed to mimic severe lung injury with oxygen consumption of 500 mL/min, lung compliance of 10 mL/cm H2O, respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, and tidal volume of 150 mL. Although the exhalation distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (red zone) was < 0.1 m, that of a low concentration of smoke particles was noted to extend beyond 0.8 m as a result of more extensive leakage through the nebulizer side vents of the nebulizer mask, with a projectile shape due to gravitational effect.",
