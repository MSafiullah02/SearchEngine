Subsequently, the following organs were collected in preweighted tubes: spleen, kidney, liver, brain, lung, heart, spinal cord, and the following regions of the CNS: olfactory bulb, cerebellum, brain stem, hypothalamus, white matter, hippocampus, and cortex. Additionally, the bone marrow from the left femur was removed using 1 mL of saline solution. The organs were homogenized using a tissue homogenizer (UltraStirrer, Biosystems, PR, Brazil) and clarified by centrifugation at 8000 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes. Supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Viral loads in serum and tissue samples were determined by a plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. The limit of detection of the plaque assay was 50 PFU/mL (for serum and bone marrow specimens) and 66 PFU/g for all tissue specimens. For hematological parameter assessments, platelets, red blood cells, and leukocytes were counted and fully described in the Supplementary Methods.",

            "text": "Recently, we showed that C57BL/6 mice are more susceptible than BALB/c mice to ROCV infection, suggesting a more suitable mouse model for viral encephalitis [12]. However, no detailed studies have been performed to characterize ROCV infection in vivo. To address this, C57BL/6 mice were infected intraperitoneally with 2.8 \u00d7 106 PFU/mouse of ROCV, which induced significant morbidity, weight loss, and mortality 6\u201312 days after infection [11]. Consistently, we observed similar results in the present study (Figure 1A). Next, we determined the dissemination of ROCV in the C57BL/6. ROCV was detected in serum samples on the first and second days after infection, while no infectious virus was detected in serum specimens from 3 days after infection onward (Figure 1B). A significant higher level of infectious virus particles was detected in spleens as compared to bone marrow specimens 3 days after infection (Figure 1B). No infectious virus particles were detected in kidneys, lungs, hearts, and livers (data not shown) throughout the infection, suggesting that ROCV does not have tropism and/or the ability to replicate in these tissues. Strikingly, virus particles in brains and spinal cords were readily detected and persisted throughout the infection (Figure 1B). Infectious ROCV titers in brains were significantly higher than those in spinal cords 3\u20137 days after infection but not 9 days after infection (Figure 1B). These results indicate that ROCV is able to access the brain earlier than it accesses the spinal cord. To further define the regions within the brain that are permissive to and capable of supporting ROCV multiplication, the virus load was quantified in the following major regions of the brain 3, 5, 7, and 9 days after infection: the olfactory bulb, cerebellum, brain stem, hypothalamus, white matter, hippocampus, and cortex. As illustrated in Figure 1C, 3 days after infection, ROCV was detected in all regions except for the hypothalamus and hippocampus. However, 5, 7, and 9 days after infection, ROCV was found in all brain regions, with variation in the viral load among different regions. The highest virus titers were detected in the cortex, hippocampus, and white matter 7 days after infection, suggesting they are preferential replication sites in the brain.",

Furthermore, detailed analysis revealed an increased percentage of monocytes (Figure 2B) and a reduction in the percentage of lymphocytes (Figure 2C), suggesting a role for monocytes during ROCV infection in C57BL/6 mice. Additionally, levels of hematocrit, platelets, and erythrocytes between the ROCV-infected and naive mice were assessed and shown to be consistently similar in both groups (Supplementary Figure 1A\u2013C). Last, no significant differences in hepatic tissue damage between naive and ROCV-infected mice was observed by measuring the levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase in the animal sera (Supplementary Figure 1D and 1E).",

Leukocytes isolated from brains of infected and uninfected animals were phenotyped by flow cytometry (Figure 3). Leukocyte counts were significantly increased in brains from ROCV-infected animals as compared to brains from uninfected animals (Figure 3). Consistent with this finding, histopathologic analysis of ROCV-infected brains showed infiltration of mononuclear leukocytes into the perivascular space, as well as the neuropil (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B). In association with leukocyte infiltration, there were occasionally multifocal areas of neuropilar rarefaction suggestive of edema (Supplementary Figure 2C). To distinguish between infiltrated macrophages and resident microglia, CD45 was used as a differentiating marker. We observed an increased percentage of macrophages (CD11bhigh CD45high cells) in brains from infected mice as compared to those from uninfected mice (Figure 3B). The level of neutrophils (Ly6G+CD45+ cells) was analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 3C) and by myeloperoxidase activity assays (Figure 3C), and there was no difference between infected and uninfected animals. Intriguingly, we found that the percentages of CD4+CD8\u2212 and CD4+CD8+ T cells were significantly lower, whereas the percentage of CD4\u2212CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in brains from infected animals as compared to those from uninfected animals (Figure 3D). Taken together, these data suggest that macrophages and cytotoxic T cells may play important roles in ROCV-induced encephalitis.",

Therefore, to evaluate the role of CCL2 in response to ROCV infection, levels of CCL2, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) were quantified in blood specimens, livers, and brains from infected mice. We found that CCL2 levels were significantly increased in serum specimens from infected animals 1\u20137 days after infection as compared to those from uninfected animals (Figure 4A). Interestingly, a progressive increase in CCL2 levels 5, 7 and 9 days after infection (Figure 4B) was also observed in brains from infected mice as compared to those from uninfected mice. Expression of TNF-\u03b1 in brains from infected mice was increased only at 3 days after infection (Figure 4C). No differences were observed between infected and uninfected mice in the level of IL-1\u03b2 in brains (Figure 4D); levels of CCL2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in livers (Supplementary Figure 3A\u2013C; and levels of CCL2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in lungs (Supplementary Figure 3D\u2013F).

By contrasting WT and Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice, we showed that Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed an increased disease severity (Figure 5A) and enhanced mortality rate (Figure 5A), compared with WT mice. These effects appeared not to be associated with the increased viral load, as both WT and Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice showed similar virus titers in CNS specimens (Figure 5B), serum specimens (Figure 5B), and spleen specimens (Figure 5B). No virus was detected in livers, kidneys, lungs, bone marrow specimens, and hearts from either WT or Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown), indicating that CCR2 deficiency did not alter viral tropism. Further analysis using macrophages derived from bone marrow specimens from WT and Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that CCR2 did not promote nor inhibit ROCV infection (Figure 5C). These data provide evidence that the lack of CCR2 does not result in an increased viral burden, indicating that CCR2 must protect by some mechanism other than directly limiting viral replication. To reinforce our findings, we investigated the role of CCR2 in the infiltration of macrophages during ROCV infection. We observed that the percentage of infiltrated macrophages in brains from infected Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice was significantly lower than in brains from WT mice (Figure 5D), suggesting that a decreased percentage of macrophages infiltrated across the blood-brain barrier, which correlates with the increased morbidity and mortality seen during ROCV infection.",

            "text": "In this study, we characterized ROCV infection, a potentially emerging mosquito-transmitted flavivirus, using an immunocompetent C57BL/6 mouse model. The increased expansion of arthropod vectors raises the possibility of ROCV spreading to new geographic areas. Several serological surveys indicated the possibility of ROCV circulation among asymptomatic humans, horses, and wild animals in different regions of Brazil [7\u201311]. The pathogenesis of ROCV still remains poorly understood, and a suitable animal model mimicking human disease for ROCV has not been well described and characterized. In this study, to characterize in vivo ROCV infection, we used a C57BL/6 mouse model, which we have previously demonstrated as being more susceptible to ROCV infection than BALB/c mice [12]. Our results showed that the CNS regions (the spinal cord and brain) are preferential targets of ROCV, further confirming the neurotropic phenotype of ROCV [2, 3, 13, 27]. Interestingly, the highest viral loads were found in the cortex and hippocampus of the CNS, in agreement with histopathologic analysis performed during autopsies of humans infected with ROCV, which showed damage of the same regions in the CNS [27]. Thus, these data could explain the high mortality rate and irreversible damage observed in ROCV-infected individuals [3, 27]. However, it is still unclear how the virus is able to invade the CNS. Although our recent study has shown that the prM-E proteins of ROCV are responsible for neuroinvasion of ROCV and mortality in C57BL/6 mice [21], the exact residues in these proteins and the mechanisms responsible for neuropathogenesis of ROCV infection are still unknown. It is worth noting that ROCV was readily detected in olfactory bulbs 3 days after infection, suggesting that this may be a possible route for ROCV invasion into the CNS.",

Our data demonstrated that blood leukocyte counts were reduced during the course of infection, which is in agreement with observations in ROCV-infected patients [3]. Humans infected with WNV and JEV also showed a decreased number of leukocytes and lymphocytes [28\u201330]. In contrast to levels in blood, CD45+ cells, which represent total leukocytes [31, 32], were detected at high levels in brains from ROCV-infected mice, suggesting that ROCV infection results in significant infiltration of immune cells into the brain. Interestingly, further detailed analysis showed an increase in the percentage of monocytes and CD11bhighCD45high macrophages in blood specimens and brains from ROCV-infected mice, respectively. The trafficking of inflammatory monocytes has been linked to the expression of CCR2 and production of CCL2 [18], which was also observed previously with WNV infection [15, 25]. Here, we detected an elevated CCL2 level in serum specimens 1 day after infection, while no significant increase in the CCL2 level was detected in the brain during this period. This implies that the high level of CCL2 in the blood may correspond to monocytosis. It is well known that increased CCL2 levels in the blood promote the egress of monocytes from the bone marrow to interact with the corresponding CCR2 receptor expressed on the surface of monocytes [25, 33\u201335].",

This is consistent with other ROCV studies involving BALB/c mice [13, 14], as well as with findings reported for WNV [25, 26], suggesting a role of CD8+ T cells during ROCV infection. Somewhat surprisingly, we observed no neutrophil infiltration in brains from ROCV-infected C57BL/6 mice. However, neutrophil infiltration into the brain was reported for ROCV-infected BALB/c mice [13]. This suggests that different genetic backgrounds may influence neutrophil infiltration into the brain in response to ROCV infection, resulting in a different neuropathogenesis during ROCV infection. Similarly, an absence of neutrophils was observed in brains during autopsies of the majority of humans during the ROCV outbreak [27]. Interestingly, the role of infiltrated neutrophils in the CNS is well described in viral-induced encephalitis [36, 37], as it was found to determine permissiveness to WNV infection, thereby acting as a Trojan horse for delivering the virus to the CNS [38]. It is likely that ROCV may exploit other cell types to invade the CNS, but further investigations are required to test this hypothesis.",

Thus, our findings support observations described by Barros et al, who showed that ROCV infection induced neuronal degeneration and apoptosis induced by inflammatory cytokines from glial and macrophage cells [13]. Interestingly, our mouse model showed no difference in IL-1\u03b2 levels between ROCV-infected and uninfected mice in any tissue, while increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 were observed in BALB/c mice [13]. It is worth noting that WNV and JEV infections induce significant levels of IL-1\u03b2 in the CNS [39, 40].

We found that the increased disease severity and mortality in Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice was associated with a reduction in the number of infiltrated macrophages and that this did not correlate with the observed viral load in the brain. An associated impairment in macrophage migration into the brain from the bloodstream in Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice supports the notion that migration of macrophages into an infected brain is dependent on CCR2. It is possible that infiltrated macrophages in the brain may contribute to an antiviral effect by producing inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1. This has previously been shown to increase disease severity and mortality in JEV and TBEV infections, using a Tnfa\u2212/\u2212 mouse model, without influencing the viral load in the brain [41, 42]. In addition, it is also possible that other CCR2-expressing cells, such as CD8+ T lymphocytes, that we showed to have infiltrated the brains of ROCV-infected WT mice may play an active role in antiviral activity during ROCV infection. Together, this may explain the protective role of infiltrated macrophages in combination with other immune cells, such as T lymphocytes, against ROCV in the CNS without directly influencing the viral load.",

Additionally, ROCV promotes increased numbers of monocytes in the periphery and infiltrated macrophages in the CNS. The lack of CCL2 receptor resulted in decreased infiltration of macrophages into the CNS and increased disease severity and mortality in ROCV-induced encephalitis, suggesting a protective role of infiltrated macrophages in the pathogenesis of ROCV infection.",
