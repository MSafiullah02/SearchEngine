The virus has 8 segments and an enveloped nucleocapsid. Type A subtypes vary in type of hemagglutinin (H1, H2, or H3 subtype), the protein that is important for host cell attachment. Antibodies directed at the hemagglutinin provide human immunity to infection. In addition, the virus possesses either N1 or N2 neuraminidase (N subtype), which also assists viral entry into the host cell and elicits the production of neutralizing antibodies De Jong et al (2003). Influenza is a highly communicable disease transmitted by aerosolized droplet-nuclei produced by coughing and/or sneezing, and by direct contact. All age groups are susceptible to this infection, although the very young, elderly, individuals with chronic medical complications, such as those with compromised pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions, kidney impairment, diabetes or immunosuppressive disorders, and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester are at increased risk.",

Certain subtypes of influenza A are species specific, although all subtypes have been documented in birds. Prominent human subtypes include H3N2, H2N2, H1N1 and H1N2. The influenza A virus has 15 distinct H and 9 distinct N subtypes, although H1, H2, and H3 and N1 and N2 are prominently associated with disease outbreaks in humans. Subtypes of influenza A viruses that are prominent in one species may on occasion infect and cause disease in another. In 1998, for example, the H3N2 subtype crossed from humans to pigs, causing serious disease in the swine population. In addition, influenza A viruses from birds can be transmitted to humans directly or indirectly by an intermediate host. In this way the 8 genetic elements of influenza A virus may reassort to form a new subtype (H*N*) against which humans not immune Schweiger et al (2002). In this situation a worldwide pandemic can occur. Documented instances of avian influenza viruses infecting humans are numerous.",

Laboratory findings include leukopenia and often proteinuria. The influenza A virus can be readily isolated from throat washings following the inoculation of cell cultures or embryonated hen's eggs. During the second week of infection complement-fixing and hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies are present and can be readily detected. The definitive diagnosis of influenza relies on laboratory procedures, including virus isolation and serological tests.
