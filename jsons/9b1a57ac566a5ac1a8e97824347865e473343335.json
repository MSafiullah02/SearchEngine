The intestinal tract is the only extrapulmonary site where viable viruses have been detected. This study examined seven established human intestinal cell lines, DLD-1, HCT-116, HT-29, LoVo, LS-180, SW-480 and SW-620, for their permissiveness to SARS-CoV infection. The results showed that only LoVo cells were permissive to SARS-CoV infection as evident by positive findings from indirect immunofluorescence staining for intracellular viral antigens, in situ hybridization for intracellular viral RNA, and electron microscopy for intracellular viral particles. In contrast to Vero cells, SARS-CoV did not produce cytopathic effects on LoVo cells. However, LoVo cells were found to be highly permissive for productive infection with a high viral titre (>3 \u00c2 10 7 viral copies/ml) produced in culture supernatant following a few days of incubation. SARS-CoV established a stable persistent chronic infection that could be maintained after multiple passages. Being a cell line of human origin, LoVo cells could be a useful in vitro model for studying the biology and persistent infection of SARS-CoV. Our results on the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a recently identified cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, in these cell lines indicated that it might not be the sole determinant for cells to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection.",

SARS was first identified from Southern China in November 2002. Up to July 2003 when the global outbreak came to a halt, a total of 8,098 cases had been reported to the World Health Organization [WHO, 2003] . SARS in adult is characterized by an acute onset of fever with subsequent progression to pneumonia Lee et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003] , whereas infection in children usually presents as a mild upper respiratory tract illness [Hon et al., 2003] . The causative agent, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is phylogenetically distinct from previous known human and animal coronaviruses [Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003] . SARS-CoV does not grow in cell lines used commonly for isolating respiratory viruses, such as Hep2, HeLa, Madin-Darby Canine kidney (MDCK) and LLC-MK2 ], but produce readily lytic infection in African Green monkey (Vero) cells Ng et al., 2003a,b] . While SARS-CoV is notorious for producing severe respiratory tract disease, a substantial proportion of patients had concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms Leung et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003b] . SARS-CoV was found in intestinal biopsy samples taken during the early phase of the illness . Studies on fatal cases also demonstrated that the gastrointestinal tract was the only extra-pulmonary site where viable viruses could be found .",

The concentration of virus in cell culture supernatant was monitored by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Aliquots of 140 ml cell culture supernatant were collected daily for RNA extraction using the Qiagen RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

Briefly, total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2 mg of total RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with random primers. The expression level of ACE2 mRNA was determined by real time RT-PCR using the Taq-Man 1 EZ RNA PCR reagent kit (Applied Biosystems). Variations in input RNA amounts were compensated by measuring the RNA level of a housekeeping gene, betaactin. The sequences of the primers and probes were as follows: ACE2 forward primer: 5 0 -CAT TGG AGC AAG TGT TGG ATC TT-3 0 ; ACE2 reverse primer: 5 0 -GAG CTA ATG CAT GCC ATT CTC A-3 0 ; ACE2 probe: 5 0 -(FAM)-CTT GCA GCT ACA CCA GTT CCC AGG CA (TAMRA)-3 0 ; beta-actin forward primer: 5 0 -CTG GCA CCC AGC ACA ATG-3 0 ; beta-actin reverse primer: 5 0 -GCC GAT CCA CAC GGA GTA CT-3 0 ; beta-actin probe: 5 0 -(VIC)-TCA AGA TCA TTG CTC CTC CTG AGC GC-(TAMRA)-3 0 . The PCR and thermal cycling conditions were as described previously [Harmer et al., 2002] . The relative expression of ACE2 of different cell lines were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle (C T ) method as detailed in the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System User Bulletin Number 2. Briefly, the DC T for each sample was calculated by subtracting the average C T of beta-actin from the average C T of ACE2. The cell line with the lowest ACE2 expression level was used as a reference for calculating DDC T , which was obtained by subtracting DC T(reference) from DC T(sample) . The relative quantitation was then calculated by 2 \u00c0DDC T . The mRNA quantity for the reference cell line was expressed as 1.0, and all other quantities were expressed as a number of fold differences relative to the reference cell line.",

SARS-CoV produced a persistent infection in LoVo cells, and the infection could be maintained after multiple passages. SARS-CoV did not produce observable cytopathic effects on LoVo cells at the microscopic level. This is in stark contrast to Vero cells, where SARS-CoV produced a lytic infection with characteristic refractile rounding cytopathic effects [Ng et al., 2003a,b] . The fact that SARS-CoV did not produce lytic infection in this intestinal cell line is reminiscence of what we have observed from the endoscopic intestinal biopsies obtained from a SARS patient , and in fatal cases of SARS . Although viral particles inside the ileal and colonic epithelial cells were revealed by electron microscopy, the SARS-CoV-infected ileal and colonic mucosa appeared normal at microscopic level and no viral inclusion bodies could be detected. Multinucleated pneumocytes were observed in SARS-CoV-infected lungs in human and monkey models Kuiken et al., 2003; To et al., 2004] , and formation of multinucleated syncytia was also observed in human fibroblast 293T cells rendered permissive by ACE2 transfection . However, multinucleated syncytium was not observed in SARS-CoV-infected LoVo cells.

The reasons for the poor sensitivity of Vero E6 cells in detecting SARS-CoV are not entirely clear. On one hand, cell culture-based assay requires intact and functional viral particles while nucleic acid-based method requires only a partial viral genome. On the other hand, species and tissue type differences may play a significant role in the overall sensitivity of the cell culture-based method. Our results show that LoVo cells can serve as an alternative human cell line for virus isolation. It is worthwhile to investigate whether LoVo cells could provide a more sensitive system for isolating SARS-CoV from clinical samples. LoVo cells, being an immortalized adenocarcinoma cell line, also have the advantages of fast doubling time and requiring relatively simple culture media to maintain. In addition, LoVo cells being originated from human, appears to recapture, at least partially, the biological consequences of the intestinal epithelium following infection with SARS CoV. The LoVo cells could potentially be a useful model for the in vitro study of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-related diseases.",
