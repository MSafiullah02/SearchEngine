            "text": "tests are insensitive during the window period before seroconversion of an infected donor. 2 Collection of blood during the window period is likely the most important source of residual human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. 3 Nucleic acid testing (NAT) of minipools (MPs) has reduced, although not eliminated, the window period for newly infected donors, but may not detect those with low HIV viral burdens during the acute phase. 4 Furthermore, some potential donors with silent chronic viral infections, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), may have very low viral burdens without detectable antiviral antibodies and thus remain undetected by MP NAT. 5 With a combination of serologic and MP NAT in place, the residual risk of contamination for selected viruses has decreased to less than 1:2,000,000 for HIV-1 and -2 and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I and -II, less than 1:1,000,000 for hepatitis C virus (HCV), and less than 1:200,000 for HBV. 1, 2 Despite improving the safety of blood components, testing remains a reactive approach to blood safety. The contaminating organisms must be identified before sensitive tests can be developed. New pathogens, such as West Nile virus (WNV), continue to enter the donor population and may be transmitted before a sensitive test is in place. 6 The recent emergence of new strains of pathogenic viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndromehuman coronavirus (SARS-HCoV), demonstrates once again the susceptibility of the world's blood supply to previously unknown viruses that can spread globally in a short amount of time. 7, 8 In addition, cytomegalovirus (CMV) exposure is a significant risk for immunocompromised patients receiving blood component therapy; however, testing and leukoreduction may fail to reach a zero-risk level for prevalent pathogens such as CMV. 9, 10 In contrast, pathogen inactivation technologies offer a proactive approach and the potential to further improve blood safety. To reduce the risks associated with PLT transfusions, a photochemical treatment (PCT) process utilizing a combination of the psoralen amotosalen-HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA) has been developed and introduced into clinical practice in Europe. 11 In vitro studies and extensive clinical testing have demonstrated that PCT inactivates a variety of pathogens while preserving the hemostatic properties of PLTs. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] A recent report provided a summary of the broad-spectrum bacterial inactivation data in PLTs with the PCT process. 19 This report summarizes the viral inactivation data obtained to date.",

The guidelines issued by CPMP and the FDA were considered in selecting viruses of various genome type and/or size and resistance to inactivation. 20 For each experiment, a full-sized SDP unit (300 mL, unless otherwise specified) was spiked with approximately 10 6 infectious units of a virus per milliliter of PLT concentrate. For some viruses, by use of the highest possible achievable titer resulted in spikes of lower infectious units per milliliter. An aliquot was drawn for determination of the pretreatment viral infectivity titer. The spiked PLT mixture was treated with 150 m mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm 2 UVA. After treatment, a sample was withdrawn for measurement of the posttreatment viral infectivity titer. Four replicate experiments (unless otherwise specified) with four independent units of SDP were performed for each virus. The infectious viral titer was measured with cell culture methods or animal systems. In the cell culture assay, most PLT samples were first diluted with tissue culture medium and incubated at approximately 37 \u221e C for at least 1 hour to allow time for clot formation, which was then removed. In some experiments, as indicated, heparin sulfate (15 U/mL) was added to prevent clotting. The clot-free supernatant was used for viral assay.

Whether 1 geq corresponds to 1 infectious unit of a virus has not been unequivocally demonstrated. Published ratios of geq to infectivity were between 10 4 :1 and 10 5 :1 for parvovirus B19 and 360:1 for SARS-HCoV.

In contrast to geq titers, infectivity titers are measures of intact, functional viral genomes, which are required for replication and disease transmission.

Nonenveloped viruses with tight capsids, for example, PPV, are resistant to inactivation. Because PCT is a nucleic acid targeting method, PCT will not impact the transfusion risk due to prions, which contain no nucleic acid and cause variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and possibly chronic wasting disease. 42, 43 Although PCT did not reduce the titers of PPV, the human erythrovirus B19 was inactivated. Other investigators also reported disparate results for these two viruses, suggesting that PPV is not an appropriate model virus for B19. 39, 44 By use of an ELISpot assay 34 that detects and quantifies infectious parvovirus B19 particles, PCT inactivation of up to greater than 5 logs of infectious B19 has been demonstrated. The effect of PCT on parvovirus B19 can be improved when amotosalen is incubated with infected PLTs for 1 hour or more, in which case up to 5.8 logs can be inactivated in PLT concentrates. 45 The incubation period allowed penetration of amotosalen through the viral capsid and subsequent reaction with the viral genome upon UVA illumination.",

In recent years, the most important examples of emerging viruses have been WNV, introduced into North America, and SARS virus, reported in Asia. 46 Vaccinia virus, a model for smallpox virus, is of interest because the blood supply could represent a soft target for bioterrorists. New viruses continue to emerge at a rate of one every 2 to 3 years with a potentially damaging virus transmitted through blood every 5 years. 47 Testing remains a reactive approach to blood safety. The new viruses must be identified before sensitive tests can be developed. Although the time to develop an assay has shortened as the technology improves, the time it takes for a new virus in the blood supply to be recognized as a threat may be significant as demonstrated by the current WNV outbreak in the United States. 48 Furthermore, all tests have a sensitivity threshold that can allow contaminated units to escape detection. For WNV, in spite of the institution of NAT in 2003 under an FDA-approved investigational new drug application, six transfusion-transmitted WNV infections were confirmed. 49 In addition, testing only applies to a small percentage of the organisms that may infect blood; a number of bacteria and protozoan parasites, including the agents of Lyme disease, babesiosis, malaria, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis, are known to be transmitted by blood transfusion, but no routine testing has been implemented in Europe or the United States.",

            "text": "In contrast, pathogen inactivation with PCT is a proactive approach to blood safety. Inactivation of up to greater than 6 logs of viral infectivity has been demonstrated for a broad spectrum of viruses. A previous publication has reported inactivation of up to greater than 6 logs of a wide variety of bacteria. 19 In addition, WBCs contain nuclear DNA and are targets for inactivation. Previous studies showed that PCT induced one amotosalen-DNA adduct in approximately every 83 bp. 37 Therefore, PCT can potentially offer a one-step process that inactivates contaminating pathogens as well as WBCs. These advances in pathogen inactivation may ultimately influence the strategy of testing versus inactivation. In a recent article, 15 international experts expressed their opinions on whether any of the current tests on donor blood can be omitted when PCT is used. 50 Most do not think pathogen inactivation and testing are mutually exclusive. No current tests can be omitted until pathogen inactivation methods for all blood components are available. Suggested possible exceptions may include omission of tests for syphilis, CMV, bacterial testing for apheresis PLT concentrates, and gamma irradiation. The development of new tests for emerging pathogens may be eliminated or delayed. However, owing to the concerns of the geq titer of greater than 10 10 for viruses such as B19 in the window period, the conservative approach would be to retain the most sensitive current tests to assure that levels of viremia are well below the documented pathogen inactivation effectiveness threshold. Some new tests may be required, even in the setting of universal pathogen inactivation, to safeguard against various high-titer pathogens that could potentially \"breakthrough\" pathogen inactivation.",

S/D is not effective against nonenveloped viruses, and methylene blue is not effective in inactivating nucleated cells and, correspondingly, intracellular and cell-associated virus. 55 Heat inactivation is effective against some enveloped viruses, but parvovirus B19 transmission has been reported for heattreated clotting factor concentrates. 56 Ultrafiltration may offer the possibilities of reducing the viral load of small nonenveloped viruses that are difficult to inactivate by chemical methods. These licensed pathogen reduction methods, however, are only for cell-free blood products; none is applicable to blood cellular component PLT concentrates. The PCT system described in this report represents the first pathogen inactivation method for PLT concentrates with a comprehensive broad-spectrum activity. The PCT system has been CE Mark approved and is in clinical use in several countries in Europe. Another system involving riboflavin photochemistry in development for PLT concentrates has not demonstrated this degree of activity. 57 In conclusion, results in this report show that PCT is effective in inactivating viruses from 10 different families, including enveloped, nonenveloped, DNA-or RNAcontaining, proviral, cell-free, and cell-associated viruses and, therefore, offers the potential to prospectively pre-vent the majority of PLT transfusion-associated viral diseases.",

The disposable set provides a single-use, closed, integrated system for pathogen inactivation treatment of a PLT product (300 mL). The PLT product in a mixture of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent InterSol (PAS III) is connected via a sterile connection device and passed through a container of amotosalen-HCl (also known as S-59) into an illumination container (Step 1). The integrated set is placed in the UVA illumination device that provides a 3 J per cm 2 dose of UVA to the mixture (Step 2). After illumination for 3 to 6 minutes, the PLTs are transferred to a second container for treatment with a compound adsorption device (CAD) to lower the levels of residual amotosalen and free photoproducts (Step 3). After a minimum of 4 hours of CAD treatment, the PCT PLTs are transferred to a PL-2410 plastic container for storage up to 5 days (Step 4). The CAD step was not used in the viral inactivation experiments described in this report.",
