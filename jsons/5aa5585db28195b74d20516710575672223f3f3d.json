Various methods may be employed: spontaneous surveillance, prescription-event monitoring (PEM), linkage analysis, case-control surveillance and cohort studies [5] . In 1963, the 16th World Health Assembly reaffirmed the need for early detection and rapid dissemination of information on adverse reactions due to medications. This affirmation led to the creation of the World Health Organization (WHO) Programme for International Drug Monitoring, under whose auspices systems have been created in member states for the collection and evaluation of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) [12] . In 1978 the WHO set up its international drug monitoring programme in Sweden at the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) http://www.who-umc. org. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides several options for reporting adverse events. One such option is MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program http://www.fda.gov/safety/ MedWatch/default.htm, founded in 1993 as a system for both consumers and healthcare professionals to report adverse events. MedWatch is intended to detect safety hazard signals for medical products; in the event a signal is detected, the FDA can issue medical product safety alerts or order product recalls, withdrawals, or labelling changes to protect the public health [13] .",

Immediate-type drug hypersensitivity: Immediate-type drug hypersensitivity reactions usually occur minutes to hours after drug exposure, with clinical manifestations including pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm to anaphylaxis. The reaction is mediated mainly by drug-specific IgE, the most common causative agents being penicillins, cephalosporins and neuromuscular blocking agents. IgE-mediated reactions to drugs are usually thought to be an immune response to a hapten/carrier complex. In the primary drug sensitization, drug-specific IgE is formed when plasma cells transformed from activated B cells interact with T cells. In an allergic reaction, drug allergens bind to mast cells with high-affinity Fc receptor, to which drug-specific IgE is bound, causing mast cells to release mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins and cytokines [15] . 2. Delayed-type drug hypersensitivity: Delayed-type drug hypersensitivity reactions usually take several days to weeks following drug exposure, with variable clinical presentations that may include Maculopapular Eruption (MPE), Fixed Drug Eruption (FDE), Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).

This process is known as the hapten concept; an example is \u03b2-lactams that covalently bind to lysine residues [17] . Drugs can also interact directly with TCRs without binding to the peptide/HLA of the APC in what is known as the P-i concept (pharmacological interaction of drugs with immune receptors) [18] .

The strength of HLA associations with specific drug-induced hypersensitivity in different populations has been found related to the prevalence of the susceptibility allele in the ethnic population. The association of HLA-B*15:02 with carbamazepineinduced SJS/TEN was replicated in other Asian countries, including Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Reunion, Philippines and Indian ethnicities, which carry high HLA-B*15:02 allele frequency, but not in Europeans, which carry low HLA-B*15:02 allele frequency (<1 %) [63] . In contrast, the strong association of HLA-B*58:01 with allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN is more universal, being found in Han Chinese in China, Thai populations, Korean, Japanese, and European populations; HLA-B*58:01 is the allele common to all these populations [64] . The phenotype-specific characteristics are exemplified by carbamazepine hypersensitivity. While HLA-B*15:02 is strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN, it is not associated with carbamazepine-induced DRESS; in an international study, HLA-A*31:01was strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced DRESS, but not with carbamazepineinduced SJS/TEN [65] .",

Histologically, drug eruptions can elicit a variety of inflammatory disease patterns in the skin and panniculus, and overlapping reaction patterns. Ackerman et al.'s basic patterns of inflammatory skin diseases [84] (Table 25. 3) are a helpful guide. The most common pattern of drug eruptions is the perivascular type, while psoriasiform and granulomatous patterns are rarely reported [85] . Drug eruptions may also mimic specific skin diseases such as lupus, lichen planus or lymphoma [85] . A single drug may cause a wide range of reaction patterns and no reaction pattern is specific for a particular drug [88] . While the histological changes are not distinctive in many cases of drug eruption, a few important histopathological clues may aid in the diagnosis: (1) Overlapping histological patterns in one specimen (e.g., lichenoid and spongiotic). (2) Presence of eosinophils (although not mandatory); although eosinophils are an important tell-tale sign of a drug-induced reaction, they may also be conspicuous in skin rashes devoid of a drug association and sparse or absent in some drug exanthems. (3) Apoptotic keratinocytes. (4) Mismatch between clinical and histomorphological features [85, 86, 88] .",

In fact, continuation of EGFRI therapy in these patients may be especially favourable in view of studies that have shown an increased survival with increasing severity of rash [102] . The cutaneous reaction serves as an important clinical tool for determining tumor response and survival [102] . The National Cancer Institute developed a scale for defining the degree of rash and laid down management guidelines for each stage [103] . Other management protocols were suggested by Bachet et al. [107] , who recommended that unless contraindicated, a tetracycline should be routinely prescribed for the prevention of acneiform eruption in patients treated with an EGFRI for more than 6 weeks. Chiang et al. [106] reported successful treatment with isotretinoin for high grade and refractory cases.",

Few cases of drug-induced eosinophilic pustular folliculitis have been reported [88, [108] [109] [110] [111] . Drugs reported include chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) [108] , minocycline [109] , carbamazepine [110] , and allopurinol with timedium bromide [111] . Clinical presentation includes pruritic follicular papules and pustules on the face, scalp, trunk and arms [88] . Histological findings include spongiosis of the follicular epithelium, and an intraand perifollicular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with numerous eosinophils that form microabscesses within the follicular epithelium [88] .

In generalized FDE, residual pigmentation in healed lesions may be reminiscent of erythema dyschromicum perstans. Involvement of oral and genital mucosa raises the possibility of herpes simplex, pemphigus vulgaris, aphthous stomatitis, Beh\u00e7et syndrome, and erosive lichen planus [122] . Generalized bullous FDE may resemble SJS/TEN. The following typical clinical features of generalized bullous FDE may aid in differentiating between conditions: (1) Blistering usually affects only a small percentage of body surface area, and between the large blisters there are sizable areas of intact skin. (2) Erosive mucosal involvement is rare, and when it does occur is rather mild. (3) Patients usually do not feel sick or have fever, and generally are in much better overall health than those with SJS/TEN. (4) Most patients report a history of a similar, often local reaction [123] .",

The extent of skin involvement varies between studies: it exceeded 50 % of the body surface area in most of the patients (79 %) according to the RegiSCAR study [142] ; head and neck edema observed in most patients [26, 142] ; and pustules reported in various studies, predominantly in a facial distribution of the edema [142, 143] .

However, severe acute hepatitis with liver failure may result and is the primary cause of mortality in DRESS [150] . Renal involvement is common [150] .

[144] . In a 1-year follow-up study of 52 affected patients with DRESS in Taiwan, the overall cumulative incidence of long-term sequelae was 11.5 %; four developed autoimmune diseases (Graves disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune hemolytic anemia); and the other two developed renal failure and required lifelong hemodialysis. The author concluded that the sequelae of DRESS can be divided into two major types that appear in different age groups: young patients tend to develop autoimmune diseases; elderly patients are more vulnerable to end-organ failure [158] .",

In the general population in Europe, high risk drugs for SJS/TEN include allopurinol, carbamazepine, cotrimoxazole and other anti-infective sulfonamides, lamotrigine, nevirapine, oxicam-NSAIDS, phenytoin, phenobarbital and sulfasalazine [192] . In the pediatric population in Europe, they include anti-infective sulfonamides, phenobarbital, carbamazepine and lamotrogone [189] . In Africa, they include antibacterial sulfonamides, nevirapine, tuberculosis drugs, NSAIDs, antiepileptics, aminopenicillin, analgesics and allopurinol [193] .

'Spots/macules' are nonpalpable, erythematous or purpuric macules with irregular shape and size, often confluent [198] .

In rare instances, extensive epidermal necrosis occurs with only widespread erythema and no evidence of 'flat, atypical target lesions' or 'spots/macules'; these cases were classified as 'TEN without spots' (Table 25 .4).

Assessment of skin, mucous membranes and systemic involvement and the SCORTEN score: Type of lesions in the skin, extent of epidermal detachment, and mucous membranes and systemic involvement. All patients should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist promptly following the diagnosis and at regular follow-up intervals to minimize potential long-term ocular sequelae [205] . Possible acute manifestations include the eyelids, conjunctiva and cornea, and result in the classification of ocular involvement as mild, moderate or severe [206] . Bringing other specialists in on the patient's care is decided in accordance with the relevant findings. The SCORTEN system, a severity-of-illness score for Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, developed to stratify severity of illness and predict mortality in patients with TEN, includes seven independent risk factors: age, malignancy, tachycardia, initial body surface area of epidermal detachment, serum urea, serum glucose, and bicarbonate [207] . 4. Skin treatment: There are no clinical guidelines for the skin care of patients with SJS/TEN. Debridement of the necrotic epidermis was recommended in past publications [187, 204] . Recent publications advise avoiding debridement, which may cause hypertrophic scars, and recommend considering the detached epidermis as a natural biological dressing that favors reepithelialization [14, 205, 208] . Various topical treatments reported include bioactive skin substitutes, semi-synthetic and synthetic dressings, and topical antimicrobials [187, 204] . A recent report on the management of SJS/TEN in an experienced French referral center described the following treatment; wound care once a day with minimal manipulation to prevent skin detachment, including a bath containing a solution of chlorhexidine 1/5000 (morphine is given prior to the bath and/or equimolar mix of oxygen and nitrogen monoxide during the bath); if bathing is not possible, the chlorhexidine solution is sprayed 2-3 times daily on the skin, blister fluid is aspirated while maintaining the blister roof, vaseline is systemically applied over all detached skin areas, topical sulfa-containing medications are avoided, and hydrocellular or absorbent nonadhesive dressings are applied at least once daily to cover pressure points [205] . 5.

Amniotic membrane transplantation was found effective in the acute and chronic stages of SJS/TEN [209, 210] . A 'Triple-TEN' protocol for severe ocular cases was recently reported [211] , comprised of the following: (1) Subconjunctival triamcinolone (Kenalog 20 mg) administered into each of the fornices to curb the local inflammatory response without compromising systemic immunity. (2) Placement of amniotic membrane tissue mounted on a polycarbonate skirt (ProKera) over the corneal and limbal regions to facilitate reepithelialization of the ocular surface. (3) insertion of a steeply curved acrylic scleral shell spacer (Technovent, SC21) to vault the lids away from the globe and provide a barrier to symblephara formation. This treatment offers an effective therapeutic option, without the need for microsurgical equipment, microscope, or sutures in the critical care setting.",

Systemic immunomodulatory treatment: The optimal therapeutic regimen has yet to be established, but according to recent publications, the following conclusions can be drawn: the use of IVIg does not yield survival benefits in SJS/TEN [212] ; cyclosporine decreased the death rate and the progression of detachment (dosage of 3 mg/kg/ day for 10 days) [213] ; systemic corticosteroids were associated with clinical benefit according to the Euroscarstudy [214] and were reported to be the most common treatment for SJS/TEN in a recent survey of 50 drug hypersensitivity experts from 20 countries [14] . One of the suggested protocols is IV dexamethasone 1.5 mg/kg pulse therapy (given for 30-60 min) for 3 consecutive days [215] . Treatment with anti-TNF biologic treatment was reported to be beneficial [216] [217] [218] . A prospective, randomized, open-label trial currently underway in Taiwan [14] comparing etanercept versus systemic corticosteroids in patients with SJS/TEN, reported that the average duration to reach maximal skin detachment and complete skin healing was shorter in the etanercept group. In vitro investigations demonstrated that etanercept, steroids or thalidomide significantly decreased granulysin expression of blister cells. Etanercept did not, however, increase the cytotoxic effect to keratinocytes found with thalidomide [14] . 7. Causality assessment and communication with the patient and his/her family, health-care providers and regulatory agencies: Recent discoveries of specific HLAs that predict genetic susceptibility to SJS/TEN offer a simple, fast, safe and reliable method for establishing clear causality between a drug and a disease [148] . The HLAs are specific to a drug and an ethnic background [148] . Since these tests are available only for certain drugs and a negative test does not exclude the drug as the offending agent, additional clinical and laboratory methods are available for assessing causality.

The mortality rate at 1 year in this study was 24 % for SJS, 43 % for SJS and TEN overlap, and 49 % for TEN. Several factors were found to affect mortality: age, severity of reaction, recent malignancy, preexisting severe kidney or liver disorder, and recent infection. The last two factors were recognized for the first time in this study as being independent risk factors for death. All other factors are part of the SCORTEN [207] . The severity of the reaction was a major risk factor for death in the first few weeks, and severe co-morbidities and older age had major impact on mortality after 6 weeks [219] .

LTT is based on the activation and proliferation of T cells from PBMC obtained from drug-sensitized patients after stimulation, and incubation with the culprit drug in vitro [230] . Following in vitro stimulation by specific drugs, drug-specific T cells are activated and release several cytokines that promote proliferation of T cells. This in vitro proliferation of specific drug-activated T cells can be detected by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine during DNA synthesis after 6 days of culture. The results of LTT are expressed as the stimulation index (SI): the relationship between the 3H-thymidine uptake in cells (counts per minute (c.p.m.)) with and without the drug antigen [229] . The general sensitivity of the LTT is 50-80 %, varying with different drugs and different phenotypes of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions; thus, a negative result does not exclude the possibility of drug hypersensitivity. Extensive studies on LTT for beta-lactam drugs report even higher sensitivity [230] [231] [232] [233] [234] . The specificity of the LTT is 85-100 % in different studies [231] [232] [233] 235] .",
