[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Pharmacological properties include inhibition of the enzymes phospholipidase A 2 , [1, 2] catechol O-methyltransferase, [3] dihydropteroate synthase of Escherichia coli and the main protease of the recombinant SARS coronavirus. [4] Biological activities like antibacterial activity, [1] hypolipidemic, [5] cytotoxic against HeLa cells and the antipicornavirus, [6 ] neuropeptide Y 1 receptor binding, [7] anti-HIV, [8] anticholesteremic, [9] binding to human muscarinic M 1 and M 2 receptors, [10] histamine H 3 -receptor antagonistic, [11] antiprotozoal, [12] and binding to the human cannabinoid CB 1 receptor [13] activities have also been reported. Alkynylated sulfones are potential candidates for liquid crystalline materials. Besides a vast range of bioactivities, conjugated enynes are also important synthetic intermediates. [14] Known syntheses of diaryl sulfones include the oxidation of diaryl sulfides, [15] acylation of electron rich benzene derivatives with phenylsulfonyl chloride and benzenesulfonic acid. [16] Despite the usefulness of these methods, limitations related to scope and low regioselectivities exist, owing to the harsh reaction conditions. A number of mild transition metal-mediated approaches to diaryl sulfones have been reported. These include the CuI/proline-mediated reaction of sodium benzenesulfinate with aryl iodides [17a] and Cu(OAc) 2 -catalyzed reaction sodium benzenesulfinate with 4-methoxybenzeneboronic acid. [17b] In addition, Suzuki reactions of phenylsulfonic acid chloride with arylboronic acids have been reported. [18] A different approach to diaryl sulfones relies on cyclization reactions of building blocks containing a sulfone moiety. [19] In recent years, site selective palladium catalyzed cross coupling reactions have been intensively studied. The selectivity of such reactions is generally controlled by electronic and steric parameters. The first attack usually occurs at the electronically more deficient or sterically less hindered position. [20] [21] [22] Recently, we reported [23] the synthesis of bis(diaryl) sulfones by site-selective Suzuki-Miyaura reactions of the bis(triflate) of 2,4'-bis(dihydroxy)diphenyl sulfone. Herein, we report full details of these studies. With regard to our preliminary communication, we have considerably extended the scope and report, for the first time, Sonogashira reactions which also proceed with excellent site-selectivity. This extension of synthetic scope could be of worth and interest because the regioselectivity in Sonogashira alkynylation reactions remains a challenge, owing to the low steric demand of alkynyl cuprates as reaction partners, Glaser homo-coupling as a side-reaction, and increased reactivity of the substrate after the first alkynylation step (owing to the electronic influence of the alkynyl group). [1c] Indeed, the product distribution of Sonogashira reactions of polyhalogenated substrates or polytriflates is not necessarily the same, as for Suzuki reactions of the same substrates, and the degree of regioselectivity of Sonogashira reactions is also not predictable, based on the results of the analogous Suzuki reactions. The products reported herein, arylated and alkynylated diaryl sulfones are of potential pharmacological relevance and have, to the best of our knowledge, not been reported so far. It can be expected that they are not readily available by other methods.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 89, "end": 92, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 93, "end": 96, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 97, "end": 100, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 101, "end": 104, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 105, "end": 108, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 109, "end": 112, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 113, "end": 116, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 117, "end": 120, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 121, "end": 124, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 125, "end": 129, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 130, "end": 134, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 135, "end": 139, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 140, "end": 144, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 145, "end": 149, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 233, "end": 236, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 237, "end": 239, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 270, "end": 273, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 378, "end": 381, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 433, "end": 436, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 452, "end": 455, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 511, "end": 515, "text": "[6 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 551, "end": 554, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 565, "end": 568, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 588, "end": 591, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 643, "end": 647, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 686, "end": 690, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 706, "end": 710, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 762, "end": 766, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 984, "end": 988, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1070, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1177, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1513, "text": "[17a]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1607, "end": 1612, "text": "[17b]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1722, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1847, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2158, "end": 2162, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2163, "end": 2167, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2172, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2195, "end": 2199, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2984, "end": 2988, "text": "[1c]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "2,4'-Bis(aryl)diphenyl sulfones 4 a-i were prepared in 55-75 % yields by Suzuki-Miyaura reaction [24] of 2 with 2.6 equiv of arylboronic acids 3 a-i (Scheme 2, Table 1 ). The best yields were achieved when the reactions were carried out using [Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 ] (6 mol %) as the catalyst, whereas employment of other catalysts, such as [Pd(OAc) 2 ]/XPhos, resulted in a decrease of the yield. Similar conditions were previously used in Suzuki reactions of related bis(triflates). [22] The use of potassium phosphate (K 3 PO 4 ) as the base and 1,4-dioxane (110 8C, 4 h) gave optimal yields. The best yield was obtained for the reaction of simple phenylboronic acid. The lowest yield was obtained for 4-fluorophenylboronic acid, which might be attributed to its low nucleophilicity (owing to the electron-withdrawing fluorine atom).
