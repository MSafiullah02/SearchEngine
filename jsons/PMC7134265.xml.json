Moreover, there has also been a lack of contextual and conceptual development and discussion of the concept of digital entrepreneurship, as most prior research examined only the sporadic phenomena associated with it [42, 50]. Furthermore, some critical and fundamental issues about digital entrepreneurship currently remain unresolved in the literature. These include how digital technologies transform entrepreneurship, how digital entrepreneurship predicts performance outcomes, and how digital entrepreneurship differs from traditional entrepreneurship [48, 50]. Meanwhile, not much has been done in terms of reviewing the body of literature and research trends in digital entrepreneurship, so the need for conceptualisations in the field is much desired [34].",

It will also examine the methodological and theoretical approaches to past studies on the concept, identify the limitations and gaps in the literature, and offer recommendations for future research. The resulting review is expected to serve as a one-stop source, offering insight into what has been accomplished so far, what is currently being done, and what challenges and opportunities lie ahead, in terms of research on digital entrepreneurship. The study, therefore, addresses the following questions to achieve this:What are the major trends, characteristics, and distribution of research work on digital entrepreneurship?What major issues and themes are being focused on and discussed in digital entrepreneurship research?What theoretical, conceptual, and methodological, approaches are being used to address digital entrepreneurship research?What are the limitations and gaps in the extant literature on digital entrepreneurship?\n",

Although these databases may not exhaustively list all relevant journals, they, however, cover a reasonable portion of the existing database for IS journals. As Levy and Ellis, [29] noted in their guide to a systematic approach to a literature review in IS, it is better to use multiple databases in conducting literature searches, since the IS domain is multidisciplinary and IS literature outlets are highly diversified. Quality IS literature is dispersed through-out hundreds of databases and some of the databases used in this study, being multidisciplinary, are among those recommended by Levy and Ellis, [29] as useful for IS research. Moreover, most journals in these databases are globally top-ranked IS journals [4]. Against this backdrop, the list of databases above was a fair and adequate representation of the relevant IS databases suited for digital entrepreneurship study, which is a multidisciplinary subject.",

Such observation may be explained by the fact that, because digital entrepreneurship researches straddle multidisciplinary fields, it may be expected that libraries and databases that accommodate multidisciplinary fields will have more articles on digital entrepreneurship [29]. Moreover, apart from the AIS Library, which contains papers specifically related to IS, the other libraries (Emerald, ScienceDirect, Taylor and Francis, Springer Link and Sage) contain papers from several different fields [29].",

The data sources available for a study largely depend on the availability of previous studies on the topic and the research approach employed. The survey and case study research approaches tend to employ primary sources [12, 31, 32], whereas most reviews tend to rely on secondary sources [10, 46].",

Meanwhile, the data sources and methods used are also influenced by the level of research development in the field of inquiry [25]. In relatively new areas of research, obtaining secondary data or the adoption of a literature review approach may be hampered. The limited use of secondary data sources in many of the works published in this area reflects the relative newness of the field. This assertion is also reflected in the research approach that was employed in the study. From the results, it is clear that the most widely used methods were a survey, case study, literature review, and interviews. The use of the case studies and interviews suggest that more exploratory and descriptive questions are being asked at the same time that rigor is being sought through surveys. The greater use of the research approaches mentioned above, compared to others, suggests that many of the papers were focused on discovering and describing phenomena related to digital entrepreneurship [25]. Interestingly of the 35 papers that used a case study or interview methods, 21 of them have no theory base, which further emphasizes the exploratory and descriptive purposes. The focus of such papers included adoption, impact, influence and use of digital technologies like social media, e-business, enterprise systems and crowdsourcing [15, 28].",

The current focus on organizational level noted in the study may be explained by the fact that many of the studies are applied studies that do not simply seek to advance knowledge, but also to understand, contextualize and explore the practices of entrepreneurs and SMEs that have adopted digital innovation technologies [13, 16, 17, 23, 26, 38].",

Few papers focused on issues relating to the enterprise while much fewer papers focused on the entrepreneur.

The capabilities and capacities of enterprises, as well as the strategies in implementing digital technologies and harnessing the opportunities of digitalization, are key issues that have not hitherto received much attention.",
