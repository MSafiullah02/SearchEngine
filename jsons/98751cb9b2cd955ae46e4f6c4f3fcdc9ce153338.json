We have examined the involvement of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in the development of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine (GalN)-induced liver injury in mice. We also investigated the effect of glycyrrhizin on expression of MMP-9 in this model. Levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased after LPS/ GalN treatment. Expression of MMP-9 mRNA and protein was markedly up-regulated in liver tissues 6-8 h after LPS/GalN treatment. Pretreatment with glycyrrhizin (50 mg kg \u22121 ) and the MMP inhibitor (5 mg kg \u22121 ) suppressed increases in serum levels of ALT and AST in mice treated with LPS/GalN. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin inhibited levels of both mRNA and protein for MMP-9. Immunohistochemical reaction for MMP-9 was observed in macrophages/monocytes infiltrated in the inflammatory area of liver injury. Glycyrrhizin reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells and immunoreactive MMP-9 in liver injury. The results indicated that MMP-9 played a role in the development of LPS/GalNinduced mouse liver injury, and suggested that an inhibition by glycyrrhizin of the acute liver injury may have been due to a down-regulation of MMP-9.",

This animal model takes advantage of the ability of the transcriptional inhibitor, GalN, to potentiate the toxic effect of LPS producing typical apoptosis of hepatocytes followed by fulminant hepatitis (Leist et al 1995) . Liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) stimulated by LPS secrete various pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a (Sass et al 2002) . TNF-a can induce apoptosis of hepatocytes at an early stage in LPS/GalN-induced liver injury, and neutrophil transmigration can represent a critical step leading to necrosis of hepatocytes at a later stage (Tiegs 1994; Chosay et al 1997) . In fact, glycyrrhizin inhibits LPS/ GalN-induced liver injury but has no effect on increases in serum TNF-a level in mice (Yoshida et al 2007) . However, glycyrrhizin can inhibit apoptosis in the injured hepatocytes of the centrilobular area, though it failed to prevent caspases 3 and 8 in LPS/GalN-induced liver injury (Ikeda et al unpublished data). Total RNA was isolated from liver at various times after treatment with LPS/GalN. The intensity of the MMP-9 bands is shown relative to that of the GAPDH band (mean \u00b1 s.e.m.; n = 5). Livers were removed from the animal at various times after treatment with LPS/GalN. Each bar represents mean \u00b1 s.e.m. of five to six animals . *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared with the value for the untreated mice (0 h).",

There is evidence for the involvement of MMPs in animal hepatitis models (Wielockx et al 2001) . Others have suggested that MMP-2 and -9 participate in the paracetamolinduced hepatotoxicity mediated by sinusoidal endothelial cell injury, which results in impairment of microcirculation (Ito et al 2005 (Ito et al , 2006 . It is known that MMPs cleave the extracellular matrix, leading to disintergration of the tissue integrity and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages (Wielockx et al 2001) . Levels of mRNA and protein for MMP-9 in liver tissue, as well as serum levels of ALT and AST, began to increase 6 h after LPS/GalN treatment, suggesting that MMP-9 was involved in the development of LPS/ GalN-induced liver injury. This was supported by our finding that the MMP-2 and -9 dual inhibitor inhibited increases in serum levels of ALT and AST. Wielockx et al (2001) reported that a major source of MMP-9 was the infiltrating cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, in TNF-a/GalN-induced hepatitis. This report was consistent with our immunohistochemical evidence showing that hepatic macrophages/monocytes and infiltrated cells including neutrophils may have predominantly produced MMP-9 in the LPS/GalN-induced liver injury. Production of MMPs is regulated by growth factor and cytokine in liver (Knittel et al 1999) . MMPs and their specific inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), play essential roles in liver injury (Pagenstecher et al 2000) . Although levels of TIMP-1 mRNA, but not TIMP-2 mRNA, were induced in the liver of mice treated with LPS/GalN, glycyrrhizin had no effect on the expression of TIMP-1 (data not shown). Glycyrrhizin has been reported to prevent anti-Fas antibody-and concanavalin A-induced mouse liver injury without affecting cytokine expression (Okamoto & Kanda 1999; Okamoto 2000) . Furthermore, it has been proved that glycyrrhizin protects the liver from various kinds of injury, such as ischaemia-reperfusion and hepatotoxic chemicals (Shibayama 1989; Nagai et al 1991) . Glycyrrhizin also prevented lysis of hepatocyte membranes induced by anti-liver cell membrane antibody through the inhibition of elevated phospholipase A 2 activity (Shiki et al 1992) . These reports indicate that glycyrrhizin is a hepatoprotective agent.",

Immunohistochemical staining for MMP-9 expression in liver injury induced by LPS/GalN. MMP-9 immunoreactive cells were localized in the pericentral inflammatory area 8 h after LPS/GalN treatment (* in B), whereas any MMP-9 immunoreactivity was not detected in the control liver (A). Glycyrrhizin (50 mg kg \u22121 , i.p.) reduced an inflammatory area and suppressed immunoexpression (* in C) for MMP-9 in LPS/GalN-injured liver. L/G, LPS/GalN; GL, glycyrrhizin; CV, central vein.
