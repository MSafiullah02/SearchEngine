Where the positions for a and d are predominantly hydrophobic, often being occupied by leucine, isoleucine, or valine, and the positions at b, c, e and g are typically charged or polar (Chambers et al., 1990, Crick, 1952, Hartmann et al., 2009, Lupas and Gruber, 2005, Surks et al., 1999). It has been known that many CC type proteins are involved in important biological functions such as the regulation of gene expression. Representive examples include the oncoproteins c-fos and jun, and the muscle protein tropomyosin (Hartshorne, 1997, Hartshorne and Hirano, 1999, O\u2019Shea et al., 1989, Surks and Mendelsohn, 2003).",

As a three-dimensional structural motif, LZ structures are widely found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic regulatory proteins (Baker et al., 2005, Rybalkin et al., 2002, Schlossmann et al., 2000, Surks et al., 1999). The protein\u2019s domain possessing LZ motif usually is a CC structure. Thus this kind of protein is also referred as leucine zipper coiled-coil (LZCC) structural proteins. Evidences that the proteins of Leucine Zipper sequences belong to coiled-coil structures have been reported by many workers (O\u2019Shea et al., 1989, Surks et al., 1999, Surks and Mendelsohn, 2003).",

The cyclic GMP-mediated vascular smooth muscle cell relaxation is characterized by both a reduction of intracellular calcium concentration and by activation of PP1M, and thus results in sensitivity reduction of the contractile apparatus to intracellular calcium (Lincoln, 1994, Morgan and Morgan, 1984, Surks et al., 1999). The state of contraction or relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells is closely coupled to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chain, which is in part regulated by the binding of cGK1\u03b1 to MBS of the PP1M. The disruption of the cGKI\u03b1-MBS interaction impairs cGMP-mediated dephosphorylation of myosin light chain, the critical determinant of smooth muscle cell contractile state (Nakamura et al., 2007). More recently, the specific interaction between cGKI\u03b11\u221259 and MBSCT42 (residues 929\u20131070), the C-terminal 42 amino acids of MBS protein has been further confirmed by NMR, biochemical and other biophysical methods such as glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments, chemical cross-linking, size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration calorimetry (Sharma et al., 2008; Zhou, 2011). These results further supported that the interaction between the cGKI\u03b1 and MBS proteins actually is that between the LZCC of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 and the LZCC of MBSCT42.",

It has been known that many \u03b1-helices in proteins are amphiphilic, i.e., formed by the hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids according to a special order along the helix chain (Mercier et al., 1998, Schnell et al., 2005; Zhou, 2011). Besides, it has also been known that different types of proteins have different amphiphilic features, corresponding to different hydrophobic and hydrophilic order patterns (Chou, 2005, Kurochkina, 2010). As summarized in an article in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix, 2010), the wenxiang diagram (Chou et al., 1997) has the following advantages: (1) able to show the relative locations of the amino acids in an alpha-helix regardless how long it is; (2) able to indicate the direction of an alpha-helix; and (3) having the capacity to provide more information about each of the constituent amino acid residues in an \u03b1-helix. With these features, the wenxiang diagram can provide an easily visualizable picture in a 2D space for clearly characterizing the disposition of amphiphilic helices in proteins.",

Moreover, graphical methods have been utilized to deal with complicated network systems (Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2009, Munteanu et al., 2009) and identify the hub proteins from complicated network systems (Shen et al., 2010). Recently, the \u201ccellular automaton image\u201d (Wolfram, 1984, Wolfram, 2002) has also been applied to study hepatitis B viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006), HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005a), and visual analysis of SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2005), as well as representing complicated biological sequences (Xiao et al., 2005b) and helping to identify various protein attributes (Xiao et al., 2009, Xiao et al., 2010). The present study was initiated in an attempt to use the elegant wenxiang diagram (Chou et al., 1997) to investigate protein\u2013protein interactions in hope to gain useful insights for understanding some of their subtle action mechanisms. Because LZ and CC proteins have amphiphilic \u03b1-helical feature, it may be rewarding to use wenxiang diagram to investigate the disposition of their hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. Our results will indicate that the heptad repeat and disposition of all residues in both cGKI\u03b11\u221259 and MBSCT42 can be clearly displayed using the wenxiang diagrams. Furthermore, the specialties of the interaction between cGKI\u03b11\u221259 and MBSCT42, could also be analyzed qualitatively by the wenxiang diagrams, and the dispositions of some key residues of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 in the wenxiang diagrams are basically consistent with our previous NMR experimental results (Sharma et al., 2008).",

Thus, the wenxiang diagrams of any LZCC structures should have similar characteristics. The hydrophobicity-weighed (w\n+(i)) and hydrophilicity-weighed (w\u2212(i)) contributions of each residue, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic centroids of each \u03b1-helix can be determined by the wenxiang diagram coordinate system (Hartshorne, 1997). Furthermore, the inclination angle \u03a9, which is defined as the angle formed by the axis of the helix and its projected line on the plane S (\nFig. 1) can be calculated using the following equation:(1)\u03a9=sin\u22121[C3\u204e/(C2\u204e2+C2\u204e2+C3\u204e2)\u22121/2]where C\n1\n\u204e, C\n2\n\u204e, and C\n3\n\u204e are directly related to the hydrophobic atom coordinate system (x\no\n+, y\no\n+, z\no\n+), hydrophilic atom coordinate system (x\no\n\u2212, y\no\n\u2212, z\no\n\u2212), hydrophobicity-weighed w\n+(i), and hydrophilicity-weighed w\n\u2212(i) (Hartshorne, 1997).",

The outer and inner circles of the ring \u03c8 correspond to the top and bottom circles of the hollow cylinder, respectively. Thus, the projected image of a helix could be viewed as a planar spiral with a continuous varying radius. If a helical COOH-terminal is close to its projected plane, and NH2-terminal is far away the plane, the COOH-terminal of the helix lies near the center of the projected plane, and NH2-terminal lies at the outer rim of the diagram. The disposition of a coiled-coil dimmer could be expressed by a pair of two-dimensional diagrams, i.e., two same monomer wenxiang diagrams.",

This result has been confirmed by the analysis of our NMR relaxation data and RDC data (Schnell et al., 2005). This domain contains a repeating pattern of amino acids a, b, c, d, e, f, and g (\nFig. 3A). Thus, the monomer structure of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 could be characterized by a wenxiang diagram. Where each residue of the denoted repeating amino acids (abcdefg)n in Fig. 3B is represented by a circle and repeated letters a, b, c, d, e, f, and g, respectively. It is clearly shown with the wenxiang diagram that the residues with same letters are laid on same side of the spiral diagram, and most hydrophobic residues are positioned on a/d region except Lysine 15 and 29 (Fig. 3B).",

This region has been further confirmed to be MBSCT42, the C-terminal 42 amino acids (residues 929\u2013970) of the MBS protein by our NMR data (Sharma et al., 2008). Actually, according to our pair coil analysis, the LZCC domain with the highest probability (1.0) should be the C-terminal 35 amino acids of the MBS (MBSCT35), which contains a repeating pattern of amino acids a, b, c, d, e, f, and g from residues 936 to 970 (\nFig. 4A). Because all residues of MBSCT35 are included in MBSCT42 domain, the interaction between it and cGKI\u03b11\u221259 has been confirmed by our biochemical and NMR data (Lincoln., 1994). According to this information, we obtained a wenxiang diagram of the monomer of MBSCT35, where all residues with same letter are also distributed on the same side of the spiral wenxiang diagram (Fig. 4B). It can be seen from both Fig. 3, Fig. 4B and that most nonpolar residues are localized on the hydrophobic a/d regions.",

            "text": "According to the calculated results for a number of proteins, the inclination angles for most helices therein are small (|\u03a9|<25\u00b0). This suggests that driven by the free energy an amphiphilic helix will tend to seek its own arrangement in a protein such that approximately half of its face is buried in the protein, whereas the other half is exposed to the aqueous environment that surrounds the protein (Hartshorne, 1997). Thus, a coiled-coil dimmer structure can be further expressed by a combination of two identical two-dimensional wenxiang diagrams. The ensemble principle of such wenxiang diagram should observe the following rule: a/d region of one monomer wenxiang diagram must be faced to the a/d region of another identical monomer wenxiang diagram. Because most hydrophobic residues are localized at the a/d positions, the approach to each other between the two monomer\u2019s a/d regions should be helpful for the formation of a stable coiled-coil dimmer structure due to the hydrophobic interactions of the nonpolar residues between the two a/d regions. According to such an ensemble rule, the wenxiang diagrams of the cGKI\u03b11\u221259 dimmer were assembled in\nFig. 5A. Where most hydrophobic side chains of leucine and isoleucine in positions a and d, and two side chains of lysine (K15 and K29) in position d should be clearly displayed on the nearest neighbor region between the two wenxiang diagrams. This observation has been verified by our 3D structure of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 (\nFig. 6) based on the previous NMR experimental data (Surks and Mendelsohn, 2003).",

Similarly, the wensiang diagrams of MBSCT35 dimer structure were also obtained according to the above the ensemble principle. As shown in Fig. 5B, the a/d position region of a monomer faces to the a/d position region of another monomer on the wenxiang diagrams of MBSCT35 LZCC structure. In Fig. 5A, although the seven apolar residues (M13, L14, Y46, P48, V49, G55, and P56) of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 localize the outside of the a/d position region, most of them are still close to the a/d region except residues M13 and L14. However, for the wenxiang diagrams of MBSCT35, an interesting feature is that most apolar residues of outside the hydrophobic a/d position region such as 941 A, 948 A, 955 M and 962 L are located at position f (where usually are occupied by the hydrophilic residues) and are little far away from the hydrophobic a/d position region (Fig. 5B). These differences between Figs. 5A and B suggest that the either hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions between cGKI\u03b11\u221259 and MBSCT35 may be weaker due to the lack of the contributions of the more apolar residues near the a/d position region of MBSCT35, or lack of the contributions of polar residues from g, b, c, and e positions of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 This may explain why the molar ratio of the interaction between MBSCT42 and cGKI\u03b11\u221259 has to be 2:1(Lincoln, 1994).",

Our 15N-1H-HSQC titration data in which unlabeled MBSCT42 (not observable by 15N-1H-HSQC experiment) was titrated into 2H/13C/15N-labeled cGKI\u03b11\u221259 support an interaction between cGKI\u03b11\u221259 and MBSCT42, which is illustrated by the changes in chemical shifts of the 5 residues (Leu36, Lys37, Leu40, Ile54, and Gly55) as well as a significant decrease in peak intensity of the 8 residues (Leu22, Ile33, Leu36, Lys37, Lys39 , Leu40, Cys43, and Gln44) of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 (Lincoln, 1994). Taken together, these data identify that these 10 residues (Leu22, Ile 33, Leu36, Lys37, Lys 39, Leu40, Cys43, Gln44, Ile54, and Gly55) of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 are most affected by the interaction with MBSCT42 (Lincoln, 1994). The seven residues of them are hydrophobic and only three for hydrophilic residues (Lys 37, Lys 39 and Gln44). Among these 10 residues, the three residues (I33, L40 and I54) at position a, the three residues (L22, L36 and C43) at position d, the two residues (K37 and Q44) at position e, the one residue (K39) at the position g, and the one residue (G55) at position b of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 are most affected residues by the interaction with MBSCT42 (Lincoln, 1994). Thus, the previous NMR experimental data have supported above prediction based on above combined wensiang diagrams that most affected residues of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 by the interaction with MBSCT35 might be at positions d, a, e and g of these two LZCC structures.",

Interestingly several of the residues of cGKI\u03b11\u221259 that are conformationally perturbed following the addition of MBS are within a, d, e, g and b positions of the repeating heptads layer (Fig. 7). In addition, the previous studies about the GCN4 tetramer LZ, an isoleucine zipper trimer of GCN4, the asialoglycoprotein receptor heterotetramer, and an extensive study of Crick\u2019s knobs-into-holes packing for 3-, 4- and 5-stranded structures have provided additional geometric, conformational packing information for generating this model (Harbury et al., 1993, Harbury et al., 1994;1995; Walshaw and Woolfson, 2003). Moreover, in the crystal structure of the GCN4 trimer and tetramer the authors observe significant packing and numerous interactions between residues in the a/d hydrophobic interface and the hydrophilic residues at positions e and g, which and our cGKI\u03b11\u221259.\n\u00b7MBSCT42 complex wenxiang diagrams may be consistent and helpful for a better understanding the packing mechanism that present between the cGKI\u03b11\u221259 LZCC domain and MBSCT42 LZCC motif.",

If the helical wheel diagrams of a LZCC structure are used to represent two \u03b1-helices longer than 20 residues, they must crowd into a very limited space or overlap with each another, and will be difficult to be distincted from each other. It is particularly difficult to represent a LZCC-LZCC tetramer complex using four helical wheel diagrams. In contrast, the wenxiang diagrams can be used to represent two \u03b1-helixes regardless how long they are. Furthermore, wenxiang diagrams of LZCC structure can provide much more information about the physico-chemical features of the constituent amino acids as well as their distribution even for four-alpha-helix bundle with heptad repeat residues. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the wenxiang diagrams of a LZCC structure can be used to identify the key residues that play the most important role for its interaction with another LZCC protein. It is demonstrated through this study that wenxiang diagram holds a great potential in providing more information about each of the constituent amino acid residues in a heptads\u2019 repeat. Incorporated with NMR or other biological/biophysical experimental results, wenxiang diagram may provide useful insights into the 3D structural model of LZCC protein and the interaction mechanism between LZCC and LZCC proteins.",
