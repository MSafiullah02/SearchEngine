Bacteremic spread of infection to skeletal muscle is extremely uncommon. Among fatal cases of staphylococcal septicemia, abscesses in skeletal muscle are found in less than 1%.2 Pyomyositis (primary muscle abscess) is a bacterial infection of muscle that occurs in the absence of a predisposing site of infection. S. aureus is the most common cause.3, 4 Blood cultures are positive in 5% to 35% of the cases in most series at the time of presentation; metastatic infections in tissue other than muscle are rare, although the development of venous thrombosis and septic pulmonary emboli has been reported.5 In individual patients with multifocal infections or associated endocarditis, it may be challenging to clarify whether sustained bacteremia was the primary process or the result of progressive pyomyositis.6\n",

Historically, it accounted for 1% to 4% of hospital admissions in some tropical areas,7 although recently in northern India pyomyositis accounted for only 0.03% of admissions.8 In more temperate areas, pyomyositis is very uncommon, with approximately 330 reported cases in the United States between 1981 and 20024 and a reported incidence of 0.5/100,000 annually in Australia.6 Pyomyositis occurs at all ages, in the tropics more frequently among children, but in North America more often in adults and the elderly.4, 9 No convincing evidence relates pyomyositis causally to predisposing circumstances peculiar to the tropics (e.g., malaria, filariasis, arbovirus infection). However, an association between Toxocara canis infection (visceral larva migrans) and staphylococcal pyomyositis has been proposed.10 Migration of the guinea worm Dracunculus medinensis in the deep connective tissues of the lower extremities may be complicated by staphylococcal abscesses, but these are located between muscle groups and are not the intramuscular abscesses typical of pyomyositis. Approximately 40% of cases in temperate climates lack any relevant underlying disease, but the remainder have possible predisposing risk factors such as intravenous drug abuse and systemic conditions including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, diabetes mellitus, alcoholic liver disease, corticosteroid therapy, hematologic malignancies (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma), other hematologic processes (e.g., Felty's syndrome, myelodysplasia, sickle cell disease, cyclic neutropenia, chronic granulomatous disease) and/or their cytotoxic therapies, and rheumatologic diseases (particularly rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus).4, 9 The postpartum,11 postabortion,12 and postoperative states, as well as deep acupuncture,13 are rare predisposing risk factors for the development of pyomyositis.",

In the first, or invasive, stage, the onset is subacute with variable fever, local swelling with or without erythema, mild pain, and minimal tenderness. The area is indurated or has a wooden consistency. This stage is often overlooked. Because the initial swelling is firm and pain is not striking, and/or involves deep muscles not easily assessed at the bedside, attention is directed away from an infectious cause. Aspiration, if attempted, yields no pus. The second, or suppurative, stage occurs 10 to 21 or more days later, and this is the time when most patients are diagnosed. The patient is febrile, and distinct muscle tenderness and swelling (conforming to the involved muscle) are present. The overlying skin is intact and warm, and erythema is commonly absent. At this point, pus can be aspirated from the involved muscle. In the third stage, systemic manifestations of sepsis and local findings of erythema, exquisite tenderness, and fluctuance are striking. If untreated, the infection can progress to metastatic abscesses, shock, renal failure, and death22; the overall mortality rate is approximately 5%4 and is largely associated with the presence of severe sepsis and septic shock.4 The progression of pyomyositis from the initial invasive stage, associated with muscle inflammation and swelling, to the suppurative stage, with focal abscess formation, was documented by serial imaging in a patient whose infection was initially managed with antibiotic therapy.23\n",

Rarely, the clinical picture is combined with that of toxic shock syndrome.24, 25 This is a particular risk of myositis caused by group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci (see later discussion). Because the muscle abscesses are contained by the overlying fascia, local erythema and warmth may be minimal and the severity of the process not appreciated until the infection extends to the subcutaneous tissues some days to weeks later. Regional lymphadenitis is not a feature. Usually only a single muscle group is involved, but multiple muscle abscesses may be present at presentation26 or develop after contiguous spread (e.g., from the psoas to the thigh adductors27). The most frequent sites of involvement are the large muscles of the lower extremities (e.g., quadriceps femoris, gluteus group) and the trunk muscles, but a variety of other muscles can be involved (Fig. 96-1\n). Involvement of the abdominal muscles is uncommon but noteworthy because it may mimic an acute abdomen.28 Even in fatal cases, the diagnosis may be overlooked and involvement of superficial muscles may be missed at autopsy.22\n",

Anaerobes (Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. necrophorum,\n37\nVeillonella spp., oral anaerobic streptococci,38\nCapnocytophaga sputigena,\n39 actinomycetes, and Clostridium septicum) have been the cause in several cases. Pyomyositis may be caused by mixed pathogens, especially in patients with diabetes in whom, in addition to S. aureus, gram-negative or anaerobic pathogens, or both, were recovered in approximately 35% of episodes.40 In the past, Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei have very rarely caused muscle abscesses in the septicemic or chronic suppurative forms of glanders and melioidosis, respectively. Aspergillus fumigatus has caused a localized muscle abscess in rare patients with myelodysplasia or AIDS and in patients who have received corticosteroids. Pathogenic yeasts can cause myositis on rare occasions. Pyomyositis due to Cryptococcus neoformans was reported in an immunocompromised host,41 and multifocal Histoplasma capsulatum nodular myositis was identified in an HIV-infected patient.42 Hematogenously disseminated candidiasis in neutropenic patients can manifest as fever and muscle pain. The scattered Candida abscesses in the muscle are generally too small to localize by symptoms and physical examination, but myositis in these patients is often accompanied by small, tender, erythematous, hematogenously disseminated skin lesions. Punch biopsy of a skin lesion shows numerous Candida organisms in the dermis. Larger candidal lesions may be identified and managed using conventional imaging approaches.43 Tuberculous pyomyositis is a rare form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis recognized in both competent44 and immunocompromised45 hosts and can present with or without features of disseminated disease.44 Pyomyositis due to M. avium complex is occasionally diagnosed in HIV-infected patients, sometimes as part of the immune reconstitution syndrome,46 and Mycobacterium haemophilum pyomyositis was observed in a renal transplant recipient.47 Extrapulmonary Pneumocystis jirovecii infection is relatively uncommon in patients with AIDS, but in one patient it manifested as an intramuscular, localized, painful thigh swelling with typical granulomatous histopathology.48\n",

Iliopsoas myositis has mimicked appendicitis49; obturator internus, iliacus, and rarely obturator externus pyomyositises have mimicked septic arthritis of the hip50; and pyriformis muscle pyomyositis has simulated an epidural abscess because of severe back and radiating (sciatic) leg pain.51 Pyomyositis involving these deep pelvic muscles may be difficult to diagnose in patients with active joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis in whom symptoms may readily be attributed to the primary disease. Muscle infarction is an uncommon condition that occurs most frequently in the quadriceps muscle in patients with poorly controlled diabetes with nephropathy, neuropathy, and hypertension. It may suggest pyomyositis because of the acute onset of pain and presence of tender local swelling, but, in contrast to pyomyositis, fever is absent.52 In the patient with multiple sites of muscle involvement and eosinophilia (from incidental parasitic infestation), the picture may initially suggest trichinosis. Rupture of the muscle abscess through the fascia into subcutaneous tissues may suggest the diagnosis of cellulitis. The presence of a slowly enlarging, painful mass in an extremity of a patient with only low-grade fever may suggest the diagnosis of sarcoma. Pyomyositis of the pectoral muscle can pose a particular diagnostic problem because it must be distinguished not only from muscle rupture, hematoma, and sarcoma but also from cryptic abscessed subpectoral nodes complicating infection of the ipsilateral thumb or index finger. Streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis, like gangrenous streptococcal myositis, manifests initially as local pain disproportionate to any physical findings. Localized swelling, tenderness, and erythema ensue, but only in advanced stages are the characteristic violaceous skin changes, bullae, and frank skin necrosis seen overlying areas of fascial necrosis. Rapid frozen-section biopsy or surgical exploration may be needed to distinguish among these processes.",

Plain radiographs can demonstrate focal soft tissue swelling, the presence of gas in the soft tissues, and any primary skeletal abnormalities (e.g., osteomyelitis, osteosarcoma). Ultrasonography is readily accessible and can demonstrate muscle enlargement in the initial stage of pyomyositis; it can also show the presence of focal abscess formation in the suppurative stage of disease, revealing hypoechoic areas with internal echoes,53 especially if symptoms are localized in an extremity. Ultrasound assessment of the hip can detect the presence of a joint effusion, but it may be less sensitive in assessing the deep pelvic musculature. Ultrasonography is usually followed by cross-sectional imaging to gain greater anatomic detail and should not delay definitive imaging studies in acutely ill patients.",

It also shows a diffuse increase in signal intensity on T2-weighted images, with a central high-signal-intensity fluid collection surrounded by a low-intensity rim.54 Computed tomography (CT) is a more readily available cross-sectional modality, often performed during emergency department evaluation that provides less anatomic detail at the inflammatory stage of myositis but is helpful when used to guide percutaneous drainage of an established muscle abscess. CT can reveal low-density areas with loss of muscle planes, central fluid collection, and a surrounding rim of contrast enhancement characteristic of pyomyositis.53 Enlargement of the involved muscle is usually evident. Superimposed cellulitis may sometimes be evident on CT, namely, skin thickening, stranding of subcutaneous fat with blurring of fat and fascial planes, and subcutaneous venous distention. Radionuclide imaging using indium 111\u2013labeled leukocytes, sometimes performed as dual SPECT (single-photon emission CT)/CT, provides functional and anatomic detail but has not been compared directly with MRI regarding predictive value or cost.55\n",

Initial antibiotic therapy should consist of empirical intravenous vancomycin because of the preponderance of S. aureus isolates from these abscesses and the frequent and increasing incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. In compromised hosts or patients with severe disease, empirical high-dose broad-spectrum therapy effective against gram-negative pathogens and anaerobes should be added initially (e.g., \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactam inhibitor combination such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem such as meropenem). Early modification of initial antimicrobial therapy is based on interpretation of a Gram stain of pus and subsequent cultures and susceptibility testing. If a group A streptococcus is isolated, treatment should be changed to high-dose penicillin G and clindamycin (see later discussion). Continued fever after surgical or percutaneous needle drainage of a muscle abscess while the patient is receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy suggests the presence of other undrained suppurative foci; relapsing or recurrent pyomyositis is frequent among patients with advanced HIV infection.4 Pyomyositis may be complicated by a compartment syndrome, particularly if it occurs in the forearm56 or anterior tibial compartments,57 and may require surgical drainage, fasciotomies, and d\u00e9bridement beyond simple percutaneous drainage.",

The overlying skin may be uninvolved, or it may become erythematous or violaceous and contain petechiae and bullae.59 Most cases involve the extremities and appear to develop spontaneously without antecedent pharyngitis or tonsillitis. Bacteremia and toxemia are prominent features and contribute to the very high mortality rate (80% to 100%).59 The rapid spread of infection in a closed compartment of muscles can markedly increase intramuscular pressure, resulting in further necrosis of muscle.60 However, both processes can be simultaneously present in the same area. The compartment syndrome with group A streptococcal myositis (e.g., a tibial compartment syndrome) may develop in the absence of frank fascial and muscle necrosis with muscle bulging and increased pressure secondary to edema and serosanguineous exudate.61 The clinical features of such a syndrome include weakness of the compartment muscles, which are swollen and tender, severe pain on movement of the lower leg, and overlying cutaneous hyperesthesia.",

This medical emergency requires prompt clinical diagnosis with verification at surgery. Distinguishing group A streptococcal necrotizing myositis from streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis and spontaneous clostridial myonecrosis may be difficult clinically, but gas in the tissue suggests spontaneous clostridial myonecrosis. In any case, all three diseases require prompt surgical exploration. Ultrasonography, CT, or MRI usually reveals muscle swelling and fluid collection in muscle compartments. If prolonged delays are encountered in the pursuit of imaging studies, proceeding directly to surgical exploration with an initial limited surgical approach for diagnostic purposes is justified. Early aggressive surgical intervention with fasciotomy and d\u00e9bridement of necrotic tissue is indicated; in some instances, amputation is required. If the operative Gram stain suggests streptococcal infection, antibiotic therapy should consist of high doses of penicillin G (3 million units IV every 3 hours or 4 million units every 4 hours or adjusted appropriately for renal insufficiency) along with clindamycin (600 mg IV every 6 to 8 hours).62 Clinical experience suggests that clindamycin has greater efficacy against group A streptococci in this life-threatening infection (Eagle effect) because of its greater activity against large bacterial populations in stationary phase growth, its more sustained postantibiotic effect, and its suppression of the production of toxins and other virulence factors through its inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis.59 The use of intravenous immunoglobulin G as an adjunct in the treatment of streptococcal toxic shock to neutralize streptococcal exotoxins and perhaps to modulate the host immune response has gained popularity based on retrospective studies and one small prospective, randomized trial,63 but conclusive evidence supporting its use remains limited.64\n",

C. perfringens organisms usually are present in large numbers as normal flora in human feces and therefore can endogenously contaminate skin surfaces. Despite a high frequency (as high as 88%) of clostridial contamination of major traumatic open wounds, the incidence of gas gangrene in this setting is only 1% to 2%,72 emphasizing the importance of devitalized tissue and the presence of foreign bodies in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. The minimal dose of C. perfringens needed to produce fatal gas gangrene in experimental animals is reduced by a factor of 106 if the organism is injected into devitalized muscle contaminated with sterile dirt rather than into normal muscle. The policy of prompt, thorough d\u00e9bridement and of leaving wounds open has decreased the incidence of gas gangrene in wartime injuries; only 22 cases among 139,000 combat casualties in Vietnam were reported.73\n",

Intestinal tract abnormalities (colon cancer, diverticulitis, bowel infarction, necrotizing enterocolitis, volvulus) are the major predisposing conditions.74 Colon cancer, often cryptic, is the most common of these, occurring in as many as 88% of patients with C. septicum bacteremia. Other pre\u00addisposing disorders include leukemia, other causes of neutropenia, and diabetes mellitus. The primary source of infection is probably mucosal ulceration or perforation of the intestinal tract. The spread by the bacteremic route probably accounts for the bilateral multifocal involvement observed in a few patients with spontaneous gas gangrene.75 However, it may also manifest in the buttocks or flanks after an intra-abdominal catastrophe, with rapid extension of infection along the iliopsoas or other deep muscle groups. The progression of C. septicum spontaneous gas gangrene may be even more fulminant than that of traumatic C. perfringens gas gangrene; the mortality rate of the former is 67% to 100%, with most patients dying within 24 hours after onset.74\n",

Evidence suggests that the \u03b1- and \u03b8-toxins of C. perfringens are major virulence factors that lead to myonecrosis and apparent lack of inflammation at the site of infection through cytolysis.76 Intravascular thrombosis due to the local effects of \u03b1-toxin on platelets and granulocytes appears to be responsible for the severe herald pain (which may be ischemic) and extensive myonecrosis.77 In addition to these local effects, the \u03b1-toxin provokes systemic hypotension by directly suppressing myocardial contractility and triggering the release of endogenous inflammatory mediators.78\n",

Clostridial anaerobic cellulitis (see Chapter 95) is more gradual in onset and progression, and the systemic manifestations of illness are much milder than in gas gangrene. Local pain is relatively mild, and the skin lesions of gas gangrene (bronzing, dark blebs) do not develop. Paradoxically, gas formation is often much more extensive in clostridial cellulitis than in gas gangrene. Clinically, it is often difficult to distinguish between early clostridial cellulitis and myonecrosis. Definitive evaluation requires examination in the operating room for the characteristic changes of myonecrosis described earlier. The clinical picture of nonclostridial crepitant cellulitis is very similar to that of clostridial cellulitis. Although contamination of a surgical or traumatic wound may be the source of infection in both types of cellulitis, nonclostridial crepitant cellulitis frequently develops in the setting of vascular insufficiency or perirectal infection. Bacteria isolated from nonclostridial crepitant cellulitis include facultative species (e.g., E. coli, Klebsiella, various streptococci) and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus).

This includes excision of involved muscles (or amputation if necessary) and fasciotomies to decompress and drain the swollen fascial compartments. Antibiotic therapy is an important adjunct to surgical management. Penicillin G, the traditional antibiotic of choice, is administered in a dose of 2 million units IV every 2 hours or 3 million units IV every 3 hours (24 million units/day) (or adjusted for acute renal insufficiency) for an adult. Currently, combined penicillin and clindamycin (600 mg IV every 6 to 8 hours) is widely used in treatment. The addition of clindamycin is based on results of experimental studies of fulminant clostridial myonecrosis in mice, in which clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline were each more effective than penicillin.81 In vitro, the addition of penicillin to metronidazole antagonizes the activity of the latter; in contrast, the combination of penicillin with clindamycin provides slightly greater efficacy than clindamycin alone but significantly enhanced efficacy over that of penicillin alone.82\n",

Most isolates of Aeromonas are susceptible in vitro to gentamicin, tobramycin, carbapenems, and ciprofloxacin.91 Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and aztreonam also appear to be active, although individual strains may express \u03b2-lactamases that selectively hydrolyze cephalosporins or carbapenems.",

Tuberculosis was formerly the principal cause of psoas abscesses; now they most commonly result from direct extension of intra-abdominal infections (e.g., diverticulitis, appendicitis, Crohn's disease)94 or from vertebral infection.95 Occasionally, a psoas abscess results from extension of a perinephric abscess or from secondary infection of a retroperitoneal hematoma. The organisms involved in the spread of infection from an intestinal site are usually members of the aerobic and anaerobic bowel flora.

Direct viral replication within skeletal muscle has been demonstrated in fatal cases of influenza A.105 Life-threatening rhabdomyolysis with extreme increases in creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin-induced acute renal failure are rarely seen after influenza A infection; the prognosis is favorable but may require short-term dialysis108 or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation if myocardial dysfunction is present.

HIV-1 viral antigens can be found in CD4+ T lymphocytes in areas of muscle fiber inflammation and necrosis.118 During the subsequent course of HIV-1 infection, various forms of muscle disease may develop,118 including generalized or localized myalgias, HIV myopathy (polymyositis), inclusion body and nemaline myopathies, muscle atrophy accompanying AIDS wasting syndrome or vasculitis, opportunistic infectious myositis, and mitochondrial myopathy related to antiretroviral therapy (see Chapter 130). The clinical presentation of HIV-1 myopathy (inflammatory polymyositis) is that of progressive proximal muscle weakness. Increased levels of serum creatine phosphokinase and electromyographic changes assist in diagnosis. Muscle biopsy can help resolve this rather long differential diagnosis and guide specific therapy.118 The inflammatory myopathy may represent primarily an HIV-associated autoimmune process and may respond clinically to prednisone.",

Accelerated catabolism of skeletal muscle contributes to the marked weakness and muscle wasting that can be observed in systemic infections. This seems to be part of an acute phase host response to sepsis and trauma likely triggered by a variety of mediators, including interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, interferon-\u03b1, and interleukin-6, as well as endogenously and exogenously administered glucocorticoids. Detailed studies of myocyte mitochondrial number, protein synthesis and expression, mitochondrial enzyme activity, and messenger RNA levels (including microRNA) in muscle biopsy specimens from septic intensive care unit patients with multiorgan system failure demonstrate a loss of functional mitochondria with sustained but dysregulated mitochondrial protein expression and enhanced proteolytic activity. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated that several critical intracellular pathways (oxidative stress, apoptosis, proteasome function, ion homeostasis, and kinase signaling) are perturbed in these patients.132 The intracellular events accompanying muscle catabolism involve prostaglandin E2 synthesis, direct cleavage of actomyosin by caspase 3,133 and subsequent degradation by proteasomes. Additional mechanisms also help regulate the process of muscle cachexia.134 An important role of prostaglandin E2 in the generation of myalgias and fever is consistent with the amelioration of these symptoms after administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors.",
