Endothelial permeability is essential for the inflammation pathogenesis underlying many diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2]. Endothelial barrier function is regulated by adherens and tight junctions. The assembly and organization of adherens junctions precede the formation of tight junctions, which have important functions, including the establishment and maintenance of cell\u2013cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin is an endothelial-specific transmembrane component of adherens junction complexes that plays key roles in the maintenance of vascular integrity [3, 4], including rearrangement of the cytoskeleton [5], establishment of cell polarity [6], and tight junction remodeling [7].",

The establishment and maintenance of cell polarity are critical to several cell and tissue functions, including cell division, cell migration, neuronal synaptic transmission, epithelial and endothelial barriers, and lumen formation. There are at least four types of cell polarity: anterior\u2013posterior polarity, migratory polarity, apical\u2013basal polarity, and planar cell polarity (PCP) [10]. It has been well established that a cell polarity complex consisting of partitioning defective 3 (PAR-3), PAR-6, and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) plays a crucial role in the development of apical\u2013basal polarity in epithelial cells [11\u201313]. In addition, PAR3 and PAR6 associate directly with VE-cadherin to regulate tight junction integrity [14\u201317]. Studies have shown that the loss of VE-cadherin causes the mislocalization of PAR3 and abnormal endothelial cell polarity [6]. However, the relationship between cell polarity and VE-cadherin in microvascular cells, especially regarding the regulation of endothelial permeability, remains unclear.",

Among the Rab GTPases, Rab5 localizes to early endosomes, the plasma membrane, and clathrin-coated vesicles and is involved in the control of intracellular trafficking, largely between the plasma membrane and the endosomal compartment [19]. Rab5 has three isoforms, Rab5a, Rab5b, and Rab5c [20]. In addition to its role in endocytosis, Rab5 has been implicated in other cellular processes, such as cell adhesion and migration, cell mitosis, autophagy, and so on [21\u201324]. As an important isoform of Rab5, Rab5a plays a crucial role in the internalization of plasma membrane proteins and their return to the cell surface. It not only regulates G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) trafficking, but also mediates junction protein localization [25\u201329]. However, the effect of Rab5a on VE-cadherin internalization and EC polarity is not clear. The relationships between the expression of Rab5a and that of VE-cadherin and between Rab5a and cell polarity also remain poorly understood.",

In addition, we describe a novel role of Rab5a in the regulation of VE-cadherin internalization and cell polarity in HPMECs.

The activity and expression of Rab5a were significantly increased after LPS challenge for 1, 6, and 12 h (Fig. 1a, b). The levels of active Rab5a were increased to 1.66-fold, 2.01-fold, and 3.15-fold in the 1, 6, and 12 h group, respectively, compared with the 0 h group (p < 0.05, Fig. 1b).

The levels of active and total Rab5a obviously increased to 2.48- and 2.12-fold after stimulation with thrombin for 0.5 h, compared with the control group (Suppl. Figure 1A). TNF stimulation for 5 min strongly enhanced the activation of Rab5a without altering the total expression of Rab5a, whereas TNF stimulation for 30 and 180 min consistently increased both the activation and the total expression of Rab5a (Suppl. Figure 1B). We then detected the effect of LPS stimulation on the localization of Rab5a in HPMECs using immunofluorescence methods. The results showed that Rab5 was predominantly localized at the transport vesicles and less at the control cell plasma membrane. After LPS stimulation, the fluorescence intensity of Rab5a was obviously increased in both the cytoplasm and the membranes of HPMECs compared with control cells (Fig. 1c).

Rab5a depletion had no effect on the normalized CI of endothelial cells compared with control cells.

The addition of LPS to NC siRNA cells resulted in a significant decrease of the NCI to 0.622 at 6 h (p < 0.05, compared with the control group).

Consistent with the CI detection, the results of an FITC-dextran permeability assay demonstrated that endothelial permeability was obviously enhanced to 3.46-fold compared with the control group after LPS stimulation (p < 0.05, Fig. 8c). FITC-dextran permeability was increased to 2.06-fold of control group after pretransfection with Rab5a siRNA followed by stimulation with LPS (p < 0.05, compared with control group or NC siRNA + LPS group).

Confocal microscopy showed that Cy3-expressing cells were detected in lung, kidney, and liver tissues 6 days after transfection (Fig. 10a, Suppl. Figure 2). Furthermore, WB revealed that Rab5a expression in lung tissues was significantly decreased by 62.0 or 69.3 % after Rab5a siRNA transfection for 3 or 6 days, respectively (p < 0.05, compared with the control group, Fig. 10b). LPS injection caused infiltration of Evans blue-stained albumin from the vessel into the lung tissue, further substantiating the effect of LPS on EC barrier dysfunction (Fig. 10c). We also observed that Rab5a siRNA inhibited the LPS-induced increase in the transvascular permeability of albumin in lung microvessels. Next, we investigated the effects of Rab5a depletion on LPS-induced lung injury. Lung injury was analyzed in control and NC siRNA- and Rab5a siRNA-transfected mice challenged with LPS. Histological examination of lung tissues from LPS-treated control mice and NC siRNA-transfected mice revealed pulmonary congestion, edema, alveoli collapse, and enhanced alveolar wall thickening and infiltration of white blood cells into the lung interstitium and alveolar spaces. However, Rab5a siRNA transfection significantly alleviated the LPS-induced lung injury (Fig. 10d). Intriguingly, after transfection of mice with Rab5a siRNA, longer survival was observed in the LPS-induced sepsis model than in the controls (p < 0.05, Fig. 10e).

There are many mechanisms that regulate VE-cadherin, such as regulating VE-cadherin activity through phosphorylation and managing the amount of VE-cadherin localized at the cell surface [34\u201337]. It has been shown that p120-catenin and \u03b2-arrestin can directly associate with VE-cadherin and regulate endothelial barrier function. The interaction of p120-catenin and VE-cadherin prevents the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of VE-cadherin and maintains endothelial barrier function, while \u03b2-arrestin promotes the internalization of VE-cadherin into clathrin-coated vesicles [35, 36, 38]. In this report, we confirm that LPS induces VE-cadherin internalization and reduces the amount of VE-cadherin expression at the plasma membrane [39]. In agreement with previous studies [39\u201341], we also observed that LPS induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization in HPMECs, causing stress fiber and intracellular gap formation and disrupting endothelial barrier function (Fig. 2). It has been shown that promoting the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of VE-cadherin reduces the available amount of VE-cadherin in the plasma membrane and disrupts endothelial barrier function. As an early endosome marker, Rab5a plays a crucial role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Therefore, the mechanism of LPS-induced VE-cadherin internalization may be related to the enhanced expression of Rab5a.",

            "text": "Prior to this study, Rab5a was mainly known to regulate the clathrin-dependent internalization of multiple cell surface receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors [25, 26, 42, 43]. Rab5a was also shown to be involved in cell junction protein endocytosis and recycling. In epithelial cells, calcium depletion leads to a rapid clathrin-dependent internalization of several junctional molecules, including JAM-A, occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and \u03b2-catenin, and these internalized junctional markers colocalize with Rab5a [44]. Coyne et al. [29] reported that Rab5a and Rab34 participate in Coxsackie virus invasion by regulating the internalization of occludin in Caco-2 cells. In endothelial cells, Rab5a also regulates the redistribution of JAM-A and claudin-1 localization [27, 28]. It has been reported that Rab5 participates in actin remodeling induced by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) [45].On the other hand, Andrea Palamidessi et al. [30] have shown that Rab5 activates Rac and actin dynamics. Several studies have found that active Rac in endothelial cells can cause vascular hyperpermeability, and Rac has been shown to be involved in TNF-\u03b1- and VEGF-induced increases in vascular permeability [46\u201349]. In addition, LPS can induce the activation of Rac in the lungs in vivo, and inhibiting the activation of Rac with the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 alleviates LPS-induced lung injury [50]. Therefore, the mechanism through which Rab5a regulates VE-cadherin localization and actin cytoskeleton organization as demonstrated in this study may involve Rac activation and the subsequent induction of junctional disassembly and cytoskeleton remodeling.",

However, similar investigations have only recently elucidated the molecules controlling endothelial cell polarity. VE-cadherin, cerebral cavernous malformation protein 1 (CCM1), and \u03b21 integrin can regulate endothelial cell polarity via a PAR3-dependent mechanism [6, 55]. Moreover, PAR3 can interact with VE-cadherin, JAM-2, and JAM-3 to regulate tight junction stability and endothelial barrier integrity [14, 16, 17, 56]. In addition, the arrangement of the actin cytoskeleton might be implicated in cell polarity [57]. Whitehead et al. [58] reported that CCM2 can limit Rho activation and thereby reduce endothelial cell contractility and vascular permeability. It is possible that CCM2 may also contribute indirectly to the establishment of cell polarity by reshaping the cytoskeleton. All of these findings demonstrate the close relationship between cell polarity and endothelial permeability.",

We initially found that LPS induced VE-cadherin internalization, resulting in the disruption of apical\u2013basal cell polarity and endothelial barrier dysfunction (Figs. 2, 3, 7). Because knocking down Rab5a expression was able to attenuate LPS-induced VE-cadherin internalization and F-actin remodeling, we investigated whether Rab5a modulated the LPS-induced disruption of cell polarity as well. Our results demonstrated that knocking down Rab5a expression reversed the LPS-induced abnormal cell polarity. It has been shown that Rac1 and Cdc42 regulate cell polarity [59]. As discussed above, Rab5 can induce Rac activation [30]. Therefore, the inflammatory mediator LPS may activate the Rab5a\u2013Rac\u2013VE-cadherin signaling pathway to disrupt endothelial cell polarity and barrier function.",

In our work, we observed that the expression of active and total Rab5a was up-regulated after LPS challenge, and the depletion of Rab5a prevented LPS-induced endothelial barrier function and lung injury. These results are consistent with the findings of Wang et al.
