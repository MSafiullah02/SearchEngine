To maximize owner compliance and minimize patient stress, the wily practitioner can request specially compounded formulations from a nearby pharmacy. Large numbers of compounding flavors are now available for pharmacists; trial and error can be used to identify the best preparation for a specific ferret.

            "text": "Antibiotics represent the largest class and most widely used of therapeutic agents used in ferrets. Ferrets are tolerant of a wide range of antibiotics; however, several general principles are important to remember when employing antibiotics in treating ferrets.1.\nImproper use of antibiotics can sorely hamper diagnostic testing. Ideally, antibiotics should be chosen as a result of diagnostic testing, rather than employed in an empiric fashion. In cases of suspected bacterial disease, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin (20 to 40 mg/kg b.i.d.) or enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer Corp., Agricultural Division, Kansas City, MO) (10 mg/kg b.i.d.) can be administered immediately following diagnostic procedures until definitive results are available. The use of antibiotics prior to culture and sensitivity of suspected viral lesions could skew results or totally negate efficacy. Additionally, premature use of antibiotics can reduce levels of bacteria below the threshold needed for visualization of bacteria in cytology preparations or in tissue section.2.\nAntibiotics can mask clinical signs. It is not uncommon that the use of antibiotics, even those not specifically warranted for a particular clinical disease, results in a decrease in the severity of clinical signs, yielding a false impression that an individual animal is responding appropriately to therapy. The typical clinical picture is that a sick animal is treated empirically with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, resulting in an increase in appetite and activity and a return to normal body temperature. After several days, a recurrence in clinical signs is seen, and a different broad-spectrum antibiotic is employed. In some cases, four and five antibiotics may be tried without success in the span of 2 to 3 weeks before any diagnostic procedures are attempted.3.\nAntibiotics may result in clinical signs by themselves. Although broad-spectrum antibiotics are generally well tolerated by ferrets and do not result in life-threatening alterations of intestinal flora (as can be seen in rodents and rabbits), occasionally antibiotic usage can result in development of clinical signs. For example, approximately 5% to 10% of animals receiving amoxicillin at higher dosages (20 mg/lb) become inappetent. In this case, reducing the dose of 20 mg/kg or substituting enrofloxacin at 10 mg/kg can result in appetite recovery. Other antibiotics, such as metronidazole, can result in clinical signs ranging from inappetance to nausea, ptyalism, or development of gastric ulcers owing to the stress of administration. The prudent practitioner ensures that antibiotics are warranted and specific for a disease or agent prior to their employment.4.\nBe specific in the use of antibiotics. Over the years, the author has seen a number of antibiotics employed as broad-spectrum antibiotics, often as a result of impatience with clinical progress or a lack of proper diagnostic testing. One of the most commonly misused antibiotics is chloramphenicol, a drug that is efficacious in only one ferret disease, proliferative colitis (the result of Ileobacter infection). A well-stocked pharmacy is no substitute for knowledge of ferret diseases or the judicious use of culture and sensitivity.\n",

            "text": "A special note is warranted about the use of aminoglycosides in ferrets. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of the aminoglycosides in domestic animals has been well documented4; the same is true for the domestic ferret. Ferrets appear to be exquisitely sensitive to the nephrotoxic effects of gentamicin; the use of even published therapeutic dosages in this species can result in acute tubular necrosis and death. Some authors suggest that minimization of renal toxicity and neuromuscular blockade could be seen as a result of division of the total daily dose into three smaller doses given over 8 hours and dilution of the antibiotic with saline (4 mL/kg) and slow infusion over 20 minutes, followed by serial evaluation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine values.22 The author recommends the use of this antibiotic only as a last resort following positive identification of an organism that is sensitive to this antibiotic and no other. Amikacin appears to be a better choice for gramnegative organisms that are sensitive to aminoglycosides.3 Additionally, use of other aminoglycosides or cephalosporins in concert with aminoglycoside antibiotics can potentiate the toxicity of this group of antibiotics, and concurrent use with loop diuretics such as furosemide can potentiate ototoxicity (\nTable 1).",

Inhalant anesthetics are the anesthetics of choice for ferrets, even those with chronic illness or critical injury. Owing to their small size, ferr\u00e9ts can be masked down easily; fractious patients can be placed in an induction cage. Inhalant anesthesia by mask is excellent for short procedures, including phlebotomy, and can be used even in some instances for somewhat longer procedures, such as castration or removal of skin tumors. Ferrets undergoing intra-abdominal surgery or extended or multiple surgical procedures should be intubated and maintained using a nonrebreathing system. Intubation should be performed only on ferrets that have been masked down; this can be facilitated by local application of 0.05% lidocaine to the larynx with a cotton swab. Premedication is generally not necessary in the ferret when inhalant anesthetic is used.",

Newer injectable anesthetics, such as metomidine (Dormitor, Pfizer Corp., New York, NY) and tiletamine/zolazepam (Telazol, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) are gaining wider acceptance for short procedures and can be combined with additional injectable agents such as butorphanol, ketamine, or xylazine for a longer duration of action or deeper planes of anesthesia and muscle relaxation. The actions of metomidine, when this agent is used alone, can be fully reversed by administration of the alpha-agonist atipamezole (Antisedan, Pfizer Corp., New York, NY), providing a higher safety factor; however, addition of butorphanol or ketamine is often required for longer procedures or to attain a higher level of anesthesia.",

When compared with newer injectables, xylazine, which in healthy patients can result in heart block, hypoxemia, and unexpected death, is a poor choice even when used with other anesthetics.

As ferrets are natural hosts for D. immitis, all ferrets living in heartworm endemic areas receive heartworm preventive medication. Although treatment for heartworms in the ferret is feasible, the overall survival rate of infected ferrets is significantly less than that of dogs, because of several reasons: (1) because ferrets do not produce circulating microfilaria, infections are less readily identified, (2) because of the small size of the ferret\u2019s heart, a smaller worm burden can result in heart failure and death, (3) increased incidence of aberrant migration of adults in the ferret as compared with the dog, and (4) difficulty in enforcing cage rest following treatment. Treatment for heartworm disease in ferrets is similar to that in dogs, with thiacetarsamide at 2.2 mg/kg IV by cephalic catheter b.i.d. for 2 days. Immiticide (melarsomine dihydrochloride) can be used instead of thiacetarsemide but is associated with a lower survival rate. Additionally, antithrombotic therapy is recommended in all treated ferrets, starting with heparin at 100 U SC s.i.d. for 21 days, which is followed by 22 mg/kg aspirin s.i.d. PO for 3 months. Oral prednisone given at 1 mg daily may also be of benefit.8 Following a negative ELISA test (generally in about 4 months), heartworm prevention can begin. Heartworm prevention in ferrets can be accomplished either with a 0.1 mg/mL suspension of ivermectin in propylene glycol given at a dosage of 0.02 mg/kg, or a monthly dosage (55 pg) of a commonly available ivermectin tablet preparation for cats up to 5 lb (Heartgard for Cats, Merck Agvet Division, Rahway, NJ) (\nTable 6).8\n",

This, as well as their relatively high margin of safety, makes them a reasonable choice in many nonspecific gastrointestinal problems in the ferret. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Procter and Gamble, Cincinnati, OH) is a commonly used compound in the treatment of Helicobacter mustelae in the ferret. Although it is efficacious, the ferret\u2019s resistance to administration of this compound is the stuff of legend. Rather than the typical dosage of 1 mL/kg every 8 hours, the author has found that 1/15 of a tablet ground up and added to a babyfood treat is generally much more palatable. Sucralfate (Carafate, Hoechst Marion Russel Pharmaceuticals, Kansas City, MO) is an excellent treatment for ulcers in the ferret and should be instituted whenever ulcers of any cause are suspected. Dosage is 75 mg/kg 10 minutes before each meal, or four to six times daily. This medication is well tolerated by ferrets. Kaolin-pectin solutions can be of some benefit in chronic diarrhea.",

The ferret is considered to be a steroid-resistant species and tolerates the use of prednisone or other corticosteroid medications very well. Prednisone is most commonly used either as a palliative chemotherapy agent (see earlier discussion), as a glucogenic agent in the treatment of insulinoma, or as an anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. In the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, oral dosage of prednisone at 2.2 mg/kg is often enough to decrease the levels of inflammation in the gut to a level that facilitates normal regeneration; injectable prednisone yields less satisfactory results for this purpose. Dexamethasone is appropriate treatment in cases of shock or trauma for stabilization but generally has little effect against chronic inflammation in the ferret. In the author\u2019s experience, ferrets do not show significant clinical effects of steroid administration at levels of 2.2 mg/kg or less, such as elevations in the WBC counts, adrenocortical suppression, or peptic ulcers. Guidance would be to use corticosteroids in this species when indicated without reservation, but within reason. Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine, Pharmacia & Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) can b used in cases of chronie inflammatory bowel disease, but results ar usually disappointing, Flunixin meglumine (Banamine, Schering Plough Kenilworth, NJ) can be used preoperatively and postoperatively to de crease pain and inflammation associated with certain surgical procedures.",
