In this study, most of the deaths were caused by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, suggesting that the impaired immune function is an important cause of death. Furthermore, we have reason to believe that the immune system was mobilized and cytokine storm was formed [1, 12] . One study showed that in a SARS-CoV infected mouse model, researchers showed that apart from the respiratory system, the heart was also infected with the coronavirus, with a down-regulated expression of ACE2 [13] . In this study, we confirmed that nearly a quarter of our death patients were caused by cardiac arrest.",

We showed that 33.3% of the included patients were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. It might be due to the fact that many of our infected staff were admitted to our hospital. It was sad that in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, we did not know much about the disease, and hospitals and doctors did not have adequate protection. Beginning Jan. 20, 2020, all medical workers in our hospital started to use protective clothing and goggles. Furthermore, since coronavirus diffusion takes place by droplet transmission, aerosolisation during hospital procedures like intubation or bronchoscopy might represent a big concern, exposing other patients and health-care staff to an increased risk of infection, as during the flu pandemia [14] . However, in our study, some potential confounders such as small sample size, single patient type (mainly hospital staff and moderate to severe patients) and lack of discharge information should not be ignored.",
