Infection with the virus causes severe respiratory symptoms in humans, with a case fatality rate as high as 37%.1 Camels may be a source of infection to humans.2 Human-to-human transmission is also possible, but this requires close contact, such as health care-related contact without proper measures for infection control and prevention.3 The earliest case of MERS was reported in Jordan, and MERS-CoV was subsequently isolated from cases in Saudi Arabia only a short time later.4 Since then, infections have been endemic mainly in the Middle East. However, MERS-CoV has spread sporadically to other areas, including Europe, North America, Africa, and Southeast and East Asia, by travelers from the Middle East.5\n",
