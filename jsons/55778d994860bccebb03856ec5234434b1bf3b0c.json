            "text": "Abstract Objective: To provide an update to the ''Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,'' last published in 2008. Design: A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co-and vicechairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development. Methods: The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2) . The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of lowquality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations. Results: Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure C65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7-9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of B100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO 2 /FIO 2 \\150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are [180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose B180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous venovenous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5-10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven ''absolute''' adrenal insufficiency (2C). Conclusions: Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.",

Severe sepsis and septic shock are major healthcare problems, affecting millions of people around the world each year, killing one in four (and often more), and increasing in incidence [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Similar to polytrauma, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke, the speed and appropriateness of therapy administered in the initial hours after severe sepsis develops are likely to influence outcome.",

Recommendations from these guidelines cannot replace the clinician's decision-making capability when he or she is presented with a patient's unique set of clinical variables.

In fact, the committee believes that the greatest outcome improvement can be made through education and process change for those caring for severe sepsis patients in the non-ICU setting and across the spectrum of acute care. Resource limitations in some institutions and countries may prevent physicians from accomplishing particular recommendations. Thus, these recommendations are intended to be best practice (the committee considers this a goal for clinical practice) and not created to represent standard of care. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guidelines Committee hopes that over time, particularly through education programs and formal audit and feedback performance improvement initiatives, the guidelines will influence bedside healthcare practitioner behavior that will reduce the burden of sepsis worldwide.",

Keeping the rating of quality of evidence and strength of recommendation explicitly separate constitutes a crucial and defining feature of the GRADE approach. This system classifies quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), low (grade C), or very low (grade D). Randomized trials begin as high-quality evidence but may be downgraded due to limitations in implementation, inconsistency, or imprecision of the results, indirectness of the evidence, and possible reporting bias ( Table 3) . Examples of indirectness of the evidence include population studied, interventions used, outcomes measured, and how these relate to the question of interest. Well-done observational (nonrandomized) studies begin as low-quality evidence, but the quality level may be upgraded on the basis of a large magnitude of effect. An example of this is the quality of evidence for early administration of antibiotics.

The assignment of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. The committee assessed whether the desirable effects of adherence would outweigh the undesirable effects, and the strength of a recommendation reflects the group's degree of confidence in that assessment. Thus, a strong recommendation in favor of an intervention reflects the panel's opinion that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation (beneficial health outcomes; lesser burden on staff and patients; and cost savings) will clearly outweigh the undesirable effects (harm to health; more burden on staff and patients; and greater costs). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of lowquality evidence were taken into account. A weak recommendation in favor of an intervention indicates the judgment that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably will outweigh the undesirable effects, but the panel is not confident about these tradeoffs-either because some of the evidence is low quality (and thus uncertainty remains regarding the benefits and risks) or the benefits and downsides are closely balanced.

            "text": "Rationale. In a randomized, controlled, single-center study, early quantitative resuscitation improved survival for emergency department patients presenting with septic shock [13] . Resuscitation targeting the physiologic goals expressed in recommendation 1 (above) for the initial 6-h period was associated with a 15.9 % absolute reduction in 28-day mortality rate. This strategy, termed early goaldirected therapy, was evaluated in a multicenter trial of 314 patients with severe sepsis in eight Chinese centers [14] . This trial reported a 17.7 % absolute reduction in 28-day mortality (survival rates, 75.2 vs. 57.5 %, P = 0.001). A large number of other observational studies using similar forms of early quantitative resuscitation in comparable patient populations have shown significant mortality reduction compared to the institutions' historical controls (Supplemental Digital Content 2). Phase III of the SSC activities, the international performance improvement program, showed that the mortality of septic patients presenting with both hypotension and lactate C4 mmol/L was 46.1 %, similar to the 46.6 % mortality found in the first trial cited above [15] . As part of performance improvement programs, some hospitals have lowered the lactate threshold for triggering quantitative resuscitation in the patient with severe sepsis, but these thresholds have not been subjected to randomized trials. The consensus panel judged use of CVP and SvO 2 targets to be recommended physiologic targets for resuscitation. Although there are limitations to CVP as a marker of intravascular volume status and response to fluids, a low CVP generally can be relied upon as supporting positive response to fluid loading. Either intermittent or continuous measurements of oxygen saturation were judged to be acceptable. During the first 6 h of resuscitation, if ScvO 2 less than 70 % or SvO 2 equivalent of less than 65 % persists with what is judged to be adequate intravascular volume repletion in the presence of persisting tissue hypoperfusion, then dobutamine infusion (to a maximum of 20 lg kg -1 min -1 ) or transfusion of packed red blood cells to achieve a hematocrit of greater than or equal to 30 % in attempts to achieve the ScvO 2 or SvO 2 goal are options. The strong recommendation for achieving a CVP of 8 mmHg and an ScvO 2 of 70 % in the first 6 h of resuscitation of sepsisinduced tissue hypoperfusion, although deemed desirable, are not yet the standard of care as verified by practice data. The publication of the initial results of the international SSC performance improvement program demonstrated that adherence to CVP and ScvO 2 targets for initial resuscitation was low [15]. . At least 2 sets of blood cultures (both aerobic and anaerobic bottles) be obtained before antimicrobial therapy with at least 1 drawn percutaneously and 1 drawn through each vascular access device, unless the device was recently (\\48 h) inserted (grade 1C) 2. Use of the 1,3 b-D-glucan assay (grade 2B), mannan and anti-mannan antibody assays (2C), if available and invasive candidiasis is in differential diagnosis of cause of infection. 3. Imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG) D. Antimicrobial therapy 1. Administration of effective intravenous antimicrobials within the first hour of recognition of septic shock (grade 1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (grade 1C) as the goal of therapy 2a. Initial empiric anti-infective therapy of one or more drugs that have activity against all likely pathogens (bacterial and/or fungal or viral) and that penetrate in adequate concentrations into tissues presumed to be the source of sepsis (grade 1B) 2b. Antimicrobial regimen should be reassessed daily for potential deescalation (grade 1B) 3. Use of low procalcitonin levels or similar biomarkers to assist the clinician in the discontinuation of empiric antibiotics in patients who initially appeared septic, but have no subsequent evidence of infection (grade 2C) 4a. Combination empirical therapy for neutropenic patients with severe sepsis (grade 2B) and for patients with difficult to treat, multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens such as Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. (grade 2B). For patients with severe infections associated with respiratory failure and septic shock, combination therapy with an extended spectrum beta-lactam and either an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone is for P. aeruginosa bacteremia (grade 2B). A combination of beta-lactam and macrolide for patients with septic shock from bacteremic Streptococcus pneumoniae infections (grade 2B) 4b. Empiric combination therapy should not be administered for more than 3-5 days. De-escalation to the most appropriate single therapy should be performed as soon as the susceptibility profile is known (grade 2B) 5. Duration of therapy typically 7-10 days; longer courses may be appropriate in patients who have a slow clinical response, undrainable foci of infection, bacteremia with S. aureus; some fungal and viral infections or immunologic deficiencies, including neutropenia (grade 2C) 6. Antiviral therapy initiated as early as possible in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock of viral origin (grade 2C) 7. Antimicrobial agents should not be used in patients with severe inflammatory states determined to be of noninfectious cause (UG) E. Source control 1. A specific anatomical diagnosis of infection requiring consideration for emergent source control be sought and diagnosed or excluded as rapidly as possible, and intervention be undertaken for source control within the first 12 h after the diagnosis is made, if feasible (grade 1C) 2. When infected peripancreatic necrosis is identified as a potential source of infection, definitive intervention is best delayed until adequate demarcation of viable and nonviable tissues has occurred (grade 2B) 3. When source control in a severely septic patient is required, the effective intervention associated with the least physiologic insult should be used (e.g., percutaneous rather than surgical drainage of an abscess) (UG) 4. If intravascular access devices are a possible source of severe sepsis or septic shock, they should be removed promptly after other vascular access has been established (UG) F. Infection prevention 1a. Selective oral decontamination and selective digestive decontamination should be introduced and investigated as a method to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia; This infection control measure can then be instituted in health care settings and regions where this methodology is found to be effective (grade 2B) 1b. Oral chlorhexidine gluconate be used as a form of oropharyngeal decontamination to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia in ICU patients with severe sepsis (grade 2B)",

            "text": "In mechanically ventilated patients or those with known preexisting decreased ventricular compliance, a higher target CVP of 12-15 mmHg should be achieved to account for the impediment in filling [16] . Similar consideration may be warranted in circumstances of increased abdominal pressure [17] . Elevated CVP may also be seen with preexisting clinically significant pulmonary artery hypertension, making use of this variable untenable for judging intravascular volume status. Although the cause of tachycardia in septic patients may be multifactorial, a decrease in elevated pulse rate with fluid resuscitation is often a useful marker of improving intravascular filling. Published observational studies have demonstrated an association between good clinical outcome in septic shock and MAP C65 mmHg as well as ScvO 2 C70 % (measured in the superior vena cava, either intermittently or continuously) [18] . Many studies support the value of early protocolized resuscitation in severe sepsis and sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Studies of patients with shock indicate that SvO 2 runs 5-7 % lower than ScvO 2 [25] . While the committee recognized the controversy surrounding resuscitation targets, an early quantitative resuscitation protocol using CVP and venous blood gases can be readily established in both emergency department and ICU settings [26] . Recognized limitations to static ventricular filling pressure estimates exist as surrogates for fluid resuscitation [27, 28], but measurement of CVP is currently the most readily obtainable target for fluid resuscitation. Targeting dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness during resuscitation, including flow and possibly volumetric indices and microcirculatory changes, may have advantages [29] [30] [31] [32] . Available technologies allow measurement of flow at the bedside [33, 34]; however, the efficacy of these monitoring techniques to influence clinical outcomes from early sepsis resuscitation remains incomplete and requires further study before endorsement.",

If ScvO 2 is not available, lactate normalization may be a feasible option in the patient with severe sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion. ScvO 2 and lactate normalization may also be used as a combined endpoint when both are available. Two multicenter randomized trials evaluated a resuscitation strategy that included lactate reduction as a single target or a target combined with ScvO 2 normalization [35, 36]. The first trial reported that early quantitative resuscitation based on lactate clearance (decrease by at least 10 %) was noninferior to early quantitative resuscitation based on achieving ScvO 2 of 70 % or more [35] . The intention-to-treat group contained 300, but the number of patients actually requiring either ScvO 2 normalization or lactate clearance was small (n = 30). The second trial included 348 patients with lactate levels C3 mmol/L [36] . The strategy in this trial was based on a greater than or equal to 20 % decrease in lactate levels per 2 h of the first 8 h in addition to ScvO 2 target achievement, and was associated with a 9.6 % absolute reduction in mortality (P = 0.067; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.61; 95 % CI, 0.43-0.87; P = 0.006).",

We recommend routine screening of potentially infected seriously ill patients for severe sepsis to increase the early identification of sepsis and allow implementation of early sepsis therapy (grade 1C). Application of the SSC sepsis bundles led to sustained, continuous quality improvement in sepsis care and was associated with reduced mortality [15] . Analysis of the data from nearly 32,000 patient charts gathered from 239 hospitals in 17 countries through September 2011 as part of phase III of the campaign informed the revision of the bundles in conjunction with the 2012 guidelines. As a result, for the 2012 version, the management bundle was dropped and the resuscitation bundle was broken into two parts and modified as shown in Fig. 1 . For performance improvement quality indicators, resuscitation target thresholds are not considered. However, recommended targets from the guidelines are included with the bundles for reference purposes. In addition, if equivalent volumes of blood drawn for culture and the vascular access device is positive much earlier than the peripheral blood culture (i.e., more than 2 h earlier), the data support the concept that the vascular access device is the source of the infection [36, 51, 52] . Quantitative cultures of catheter and peripheral blood may also be useful for determining whether the catheter is the source of infection. The volume of blood drawn with the culture tube should be C10 mL [53] . Quantitative (or semiquantitative) cultures of respiratory tract secretions are often recommended for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [54], but their diagnostic value remains unclear [55] .",

Remark: Although the weight of the evidence supports prompt administration of antibiotics following the recognition of severe sepsis and septic shock, the feasibility with which clinicians may achieve this ideal state has not been scientifically evaluated. If antimicrobial agents cannot be mixed and delivered promptly from the pharmacy, establishing a supply of premixed antibiotics for such urgent situations is an appropriate strategy for ensuring prompt administration. Many antibiotics will not remain stable if premixed in a solution. This risk must be taken into consideration in institutions that rely on premixed solutions for rapid availability of antibiotics. In choosing the antimicrobial regimen, clinicians should be aware that some antimicrobial agents have the advantage of bolus administration, while others require a lengthy infusion. Thus, if vascular access is limited and many different agents must be infused, bolus drugs may offer an advantage. 2a.

The choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy depends on complex issues related to the patient's history, including drug intolerances, recent receipt of antibiotics (previous 3 months), underlying disease, the clinical syndrome, and susceptibility patterns of pathogens in the community and hospital, and that previously have been documented to colonize or infect the patient. The most common pathogens that cause septic shock in hospitalized patients are Gram-positive bacteria, followed by Gramnegative and mixed bacterial microorganisms. Candidiasis, toxic shock syndromes, and an array of uncommon pathogens should be considered in selected patients. An especially wide range of potential pathogens exists for neutropenic patients. Recently used anti-infective agents should generally be avoided. When choosing empirical therapy, clinicians should be cognizant of the virulence and growing prevalence of oxacillin (methicillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and resistance to broad-spectrum beta-lactams and carbapenem among Gram-negative bacilli in some communities and healthcare settings. Within regions in which the prevalence of such drug-resistant organisms is significant, empiric therapy adequate to cover these pathogens is warranted. Clinicians should also consider whether candidemia is a likely pathogen when choosing initial therapy. When deemed warranted, the selection of empirical antifungal therapy (e.g., an echinocandin, triazoles such as fluconazole, or a formulation of amphotericin B) should be tailored to the local pattern of the most prevalent Candida species and any recent exposure to antifungal drugs [78] . Recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend either fluconazole or an echinocandin. Empiric use of an echinocandin is preferred in most patients with severe illness, especially in those patients who have recently been treated with antifungal agents, or if Candida glabrata infection is suspected from earlier culture data. Knowledge of local resistance patterns to antifungal agents should guide drug selection until fungal susceptibility test results, if available, are performed. Risk factors for candidemia, such as immunosuppressed or neutropenic state, prior intense antibiotic therapy, or colonization in multiple sites, should also be considered when choosing initial therapy.",

Antibiotic choices should be guided by local prevalence patterns of bacterial pathogens and susceptibility data. Ample evidence exists that failure to initiate appropriate therapy (i.e., therapy with activity against the pathogen that is subsequently identified as the causative agent) correlates with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [68, 71, 79, 80] . Recent exposure to antimicrobials (within last 3 months) should be considered in the choice of an empiric antibacterial regimen. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock warrant broad-spectrum therapy until the causative organism and its antimicrobial susceptibilities are defined. Although a global restriction of antibiotics is an important strategy to reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance and to reduce cost, it is not an appropriate strategy in the initial therapy for this patient population. However, as soon as the causative pathogen has been identified, deescalation should be performed by selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial agent that covers the pathogen and is safe and cost-effective. Collaboration with antimicrobial stewardship programs, where they exist, is encouraged to ensure appropriate choices and rapid availability of effective antimicrobials for treating septic patients. All patients should receive a full loading dose of each agent. Patients with sepsis often have abnormal and vacillating renal or hepatic function, or may have abnormally high volumes of distribution due to aggressive fluid resuscitation, requiring dose adjustment. Drug serum concentration monitoring can be useful in an ICU setting for those drugs that can be measured promptly. Significant expertise is required to ensure that serum concentrations maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity [81, 82].",

Moreover, a randomized surgical study found that a minimally invasive, step-up approach was better tolerated by patients and had a lower mortality than open necrosectomy in necrotizing pancreatitis [112] , although areas of uncertainty exist, such as definitive documentation of infection and appropriate length of delay. The selection of optimal source control methods must weigh the benefits and risks of the specific intervention as well as risks of transfer [113] . Source control interventions may cause further complications, such as bleeding, fistulas, or inadvertent organ injury. Surgical intervention should be considered when other interventional approaches are inadequate or when diagnostic uncertainty persists despite radiologic evaluation. Specific clinical situations require consideration of available choices, the patient's preferences, and the clinician's expertise.",

The role of SDD with systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis and its variants (e.g., SOD, CHG) has been a contentious issue ever since the concept was first developed more than 30 years ago. The notion of limiting the acquisition of opportunistic, often multiresistant, healthcare-associated microorganisms has its appeal by promoting ''colonization resistance'' from the resident microbiome existing along mucosal surfaces of the alimentary tract. However, the efficacy of SDD, its safety, propensity to prevent or promote antibiotic resistance, and cost-effectiveness remain debatable despite a number of favorable meta-analyses and controlled clinical trials [115] . The data indicate an overall reduction in VAP but no consistent improvement in mortality, except in selected populations in some studies. Most studies do not specifically address the efficacy of SDD in patients who present with sepsis, but some do [116] [117] [118] .",

The absence of any clear benefit following the administration of colloid solutions compared to crystalloid solutions, together with the expense associated with colloid solutions, supports a high-grade recommendation for the use of crystalloid solutions in the initial resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Three recent multicenter RCTs evaluating 6 % HES 130/0.4 solutions (tetra starches) have been published. The CRYSTMAS study demonstrated no difference in mortality with HES versus 0.9 % normal saline (31 vs. 25.3 %, P = 0.37) in the resuscitation of septic shock patients; however, the study was underpowered to detect the 6 % difference in absolute mortality observed [122] . In a sicker patient cohort, a Scandinavian multicenter study in septic patients (6S Trial Group) showed increased mortality rates with 6 % HES 130/0.42 fluid resuscitation compared to Ringer's acetate (51 vs. 43 %. P = 0.03) [123] . The CHEST study, conducted in a heterogenous population of patients admitted to intensive care (HES vs. isotonic saline, n = 7000 critically ill patients), showed no difference in 90-day mortality between resuscitation with 6 % HES with a molecular weight of 130 kD/0.40 and isotonic saline (18 vs. 17 %, P = 0.26); the need for renal replacement therapy was higher in the HES group [7.0 vs. 5.8 %; relative risk (RR), 1.21; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.45; P = 0.04] [124]. A meta-analysis of 56 randomized trials found no overall difference in mortality between crystalloids and artificial colloids (modified gelatins, HES, dextran) when used for initial fluid resuscitation [125]. Information from 3 randomized trials (n = 704 patients with severe sepsis/septic shock) did not show survival benefit with use of heta-, hexa-, or pentastarches compared to other fluids (RR, 1.15; 95 % CI, 0.95-1.39; random effect; I 2 = 0 %) [126] [127] [128] . However, these solutions increased substantially the risk of acute kidney injury (RR, 1.60; 95 % CI, 1.26-2.04; I 2 = 0 %) [126] [127] [128] . The evidence of harm observed in the 6S and CHEST studies and the meta-analysis supports a highlevel recommendation advising against the use of HES solutions in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, particularly since other options for fluid resuscitation exist. The CRYSTAL trial, another large prospective clinical trial comparing crystalloids and colloids, was recently completed and will provide additional insight into HES fluid resuscitation.",

A meta-analysis aggregated data from 17 randomized trials (n = 1977) of albumin versus other fluid solutions in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock [130]; 279 deaths occurred among 961 albumin-treated patients versus 343 deaths among 1,016 patients treated with other fluids, thus favoring albumin [odds ratio (OR), 0.82; 95 % CI, 0.67-1.00; I 2 = 0 %]. When albumin-treated patients were compared with those receiving crystalloids (7 trials, n = 1441), the OR of dying was significantly reduced for albumin-treated patients (OR, 0.78; 95 % CI, 0.62-0.99; I 2 = 0 %). A multicenter randomized trial (n = 794) in patients with septic shock compared intravenous albumin (20 g, 20 %) every 8 h for 3 days to intravenous saline solution [130]; albumin therapy was associated with 2.2 % absolute reduction in 28-day mortality (from 26.3 Table 6 Recommendations: hemodynamic support and adjunctive therapy to 24.1 %), but did not achieve statistical significance. These data support a low-level recommendation regarding the use of albumin in patients with sepsis and septic shock (personal communication from J.P. Mira and as presented at the 32nd International ISICEM Congress 2012, Brussels and the 25th ESICM Annual Congress 2012, Lisbon). 4 . We recommend an initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion with suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/ kg of crystalloids (a portion of this may be albumin equivalent). More rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (see Initial Resuscitation recommendations) (grade 1C). 5. We recommend that a fluid challenge technique be applied wherein fluid administration is continued as long as there is hemodynamic improvement either based on dynamic (e.g., change in pulse pressure, stroke volume variation) or static (e.g., arterial pressure, heart rate) variables (UG). from the evidence-based target of 65 mmHg used in this recommendation. In any case, the optimal MAP should be individualized as it may be higher in patients with atherosclerosis and/or previous hypertension than in young patients without cardiovascular comorbidity. For example, a MAP of 65 mmHg might be too low in a patient with severe uncontrolled hypertension; in a young, previously normotensive patient, a lower MAP might be adequate. Supplementing endpoints, such as blood pressure, with assessment of regional and global perfusion, such as blood lactate concentrations, skin perfusion, mental status, and urine output, is important. Adequate fluid resuscitation is a fundamental aspect of the hemodynamic management of patients with septic shock and should ideally be achieved before vasopressors and inotropes are used; however, using vasopressors early as an emergency measure in patients with severe shock is frequently necessary, as when diastolic blood pressure is too low. When that occurs, great effort should be directed to weaning vasopressors with continuing fluid resuscitation.",

Table 7 depicts a GRADEpro Summary of Evidence Table comparing dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of septic shock. Dopamine increases MAP and cardiac output, primarily due to an increase in stroke volume and heart rate. Norepinephrine increases MAP due to its vasoconstrictive effects, with little change in heart rate and less increase in stroke volume compared with dopamine. Norepinephrine is more potent than dopamine and may be more effective at reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock. Dopamine may be particularly useful in patients with compromised systolic function but causes more tachycardia and may be more arrhythmogenic than norepinephrine [148] . It may also influence the endocrine response via the hypothalamic pituitary axis and have immunosuppressive effects. However, information from five randomized trials (n = Although some human and animal studies suggest epinephrine has deleterious effects on splanchnic circulation and produces hyperlactatemia, no clinical evidence shows that epinephrine results in worse outcomes, and it should be the first alternative to norepinephrine. Indeed, information from 4 randomized trials (n = 540) comparing norepinephrine to epinephrine found no evidence for differences in the risk of dying (RR, 0.96; CI, 0.77-1.21; fixed effect; I 2 = 0 %) [142, 147, 154, 155] . Epinephrine may increase aerobic lactate production via stimulation of skeletal muscles' b 2 -adrenergic receptors and thus may prevent the use of lactate clearance to guide resuscitation. With its almost pure a-adrenergic effects, phenylephrine is the adrenergic agent least likely to produce tachycardia, but it may decrease stroke volume and is therefore not recommended for use in the treatment of septic shock except in circumstances where norepinephrine is: (a) associated with serious arrhythmias, or (b) cardiac output is known to be high, or (c) as salvage therapy when other vasopressor agents have failed to achieve target MAP [156] . Vasopressin levels in septic shock have been reported to be lower than anticipated for a shock state [157] . Low doses of vasopressin may be effective in raising blood pressure in patients, refractory to other vasopressors and may have other potential physiologic benefits [158-163]. Terlipressin has similar effects but is long acting [164] . Studies show that vasopressin concentrations are elevated in early septic shock, but decrease to normal range in the majority of patients between 24 and 48 h as shock continues [165] . This has been called relative CI confidence interval, RR risk ratio a The assumed risk is the control group risk across studies. The corresponding risk (and its 95 % CI) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95 % CI) b Strong heterogeneity in the results (I 2 = 85 %), however, this reflects degree of effect, not direction of effect. We have decided not to lower the evidence quality c Effect results in part from hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock patients in [152] vasopressin deficiency because in the presence of hypotension, vasopressin would be expected to be elevated. The significance of this finding is unknown. The VASST trial, a randomized, controlled trial comparing norepinephrine alone to norepinephrine plus vasopressin at 0.03 U/min, showed no difference in outcome in the intent-to-treat population [166] . An a priori defined subgroup analysis demonstrated that survival among patients receiving \\15 lg/min norepinephrine at the time of randomization was better with the addition of vasopressin; however, the pretrial rationale for this stratification was based on exploring potential benefit in the population requiring C15 lg/min norepinephrine.

Therefore, treatment with a combined inotrope/vasopressor, such as norepinephrine or epinephrine, is recommended if cardiac output is not measured. When the capability exists for monitoring cardiac output in addition to blood pressure, a vasopressor, such as norepinephrine, may be used separately to target specific levels of MAP and cardiac output. Large prospective clinical trials, which included critically ill ICU patients who had severe sepsis, failed to demonstrate benefit from increasing oxygen delivery to supranormal targets by use of dobutamine [173, 174] . These studies did not specifically target patients with severe sepsis and did not target the first 6 h of resuscitation. If evidence of tissue hypoperfusion persists despite adequate intravascular volume and adequate MAP, a viable alternative (other than reversing underlying insult) is to add inotropic therapy.",

Cortisol immunoassays may over-or underestimate the actual cortisol level, affecting the assignment of patients to responders or nonresponders [184] . Although the clinical significance is not clear, it is now recognized that etomidate, when used for induction for intubation, will suppress the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis [185, 186] . Moreover, a subanalysis of the CORTICUS trial [178] revealed that the use of etomidate before application of low-dose steroids was associated with an increased 28-day mortality rate [187] .

Patients with severe sepsis are likely to have some limitation of platelet production similar to that in chemotherapy-treated patients, but they also are likely to have increased platelet consumption. Recommendations take into account the etiology of thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, risk of bleeding, and presence of Table 8 Recommendations: other supportive therapy of severe sepsis K. Blood product administration 1. Once tissue hypoperfusion has resolved and in the absence of extenuating circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, acute hemorrhage, or ischemic heart disease, we recommend that red blood cell transfusion occur only when hemoglobin concentration decreases to \\7.0 g/dL to target a hemoglobin concentration of 7.0-9.0 g/dL in adults (grade 1B). 2. Not using erythropoietin as a specific treatment of anemia associated with severe sepsis (grade 1B). 3. Fresh frozen plasma not be used to correct laboratory clotting abnormalities in the absence of bleeding or planned invasive procedures (grade 2D). 4. Not using antithrombin for the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock (grade 1B). 5. In patients with severe sepsis, administer platelets prophylactically when counts are B10,000/mm 3 (10 9 10 9 /L) in the absence of apparent bleeding. We suggest prophylactic platelet transfusion when counts are B20,000/mm 3 (20 9 10 9 /L) if the patient has a significant risk of bleeding. Higher platelet counts (C50,000/mm 3 [50 9 10 9 /L]) are advised for active bleeding, surgery, or invasive procedures (grade 2D). L. Immunoglobulins 1. Not using intravenous immunoglobulins in adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (grade 2B). M. Selenium 1. Not using intravenous selenium for the treatment of severe sepsis (grade 2C). N. History of Recommendations Regarding Use of Recombinant Activated Protein C (rhAPC) A history of the evolution of SSC recommendations as to rhAPC (no longer available) is provided. O. Mechanical ventilation of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 1. Target a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (grade 1A vs. 12 mL/kg). 2. Plateau pressures be measured in patients with ARDS and initial upper limit goal for plateau pressures in a passively inflated lung be B30 cm H 2 O (grade 1B). 3. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) be applied to avoid alveolar collapse at end expiration (atelectotrauma) (grade 1B). 4. Strategies based on higher rather than lower levels of PEEP be used for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (grade 2C). 5. Recruitment maneuvers be used in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia (grade 2C). 6. Prone positioning be used in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio B100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (grade 2B). 7. That mechanically ventilated sepsis patients be maintained with the head of the bed elevated to 30-45 degrees to limit aspiration risk and to prevent the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (grade 1B). 8. That noninvasive mask ventilation (NIV) be used in that minority of sepsis-induced ARDS patients in whom the benefits of NIV have been carefully considered and are thought to outweigh the risks (grade 2B). 9. That a weaning protocol be in place and that mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis undergo spontaneous breathing trials regularly to evaluate the ability to discontinue mechanical ventilation when they satisfy the following criteria: a) arousable; b) hemodynamically stable (without vasopressor agents); c) no new potentially serious conditions; d) low ventilatory and end-expiratory pressure requirements; and e) low FIo 2 requirements which can be met safely delivered with a face mask or nasal cannula. If the spontaneous breathing trial is successful, consideration should be given for extubation (grade 1A). 10. Against the routine use of the pulmonary artery catheter for patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (grade 1A). 11. A conservative rather than liberal fluid strategy for patients with established sepsis-induced ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (grade 1C). 12. In the absence of specific indications such as bronchospasm, not using beta 2-agonists for treatment of sepsis-induced ARDS. (Grade 1B). P. Sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade in sepsis 1. Continuous or intermittent sedation be minimized in mechanically ventilated sepsis patients, targeting specific titration endpoints (grade 1B). 2. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) be avoided if possible in the septic patient without ARDS due to the risk of prolonged neuromuscular blockade following discontinuation. If NMBAs must be maintained, either intermittent bolus as required or continuous infusion with train-of-four monitoring of the depth of blockade should be used (grade 1C). 3. A short course of NMBA of not greater than 48 hours for patients with early sepsis-induced ARDS and a PaO 2 /FIO 2 \\150 mm Hg (grade 2C). Q. Glucose control 1. A protocolized approach to blood glucose management in ICU patients with severe sepsis commencing insulin dosing when 2 consecutive blood glucose levels are [180 mg/dL. This protocolized approach should target an upper blood glucose B180 mg/dL rather than an upper target blood glucose B110 mg/dL (grade 1A). 2. blood glucose values be monitored every 1-2 hrs until glucose values and insulin infusion rates are stable and then every 4 hrs thereafter (grade 1C). 3. glucose levels obtained with point-of-care testing of capillary blood be interpreted with caution, as such measurements may not accurately estimate arterial blood or plasma glucose values (UG). R. Renal replacement therapy 1. Continuous renal replacement therapies and intermittent hemodialysis are equivalent in patients with severe sepsis and acute renal failure (grade 2B). 2. Use continuous therapies to facilitate management of fluid balance in hemodynamically unstable septic patients (grade 2D). concomitant disorders [200, 202, 203, 208, 209] . Factors that may increase the bleeding risk and indicate the need for a higher platelet count are frequently present in patients with severe sepsis. Sepsis itself is considered to be a risk factor for bleeding in patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Other factors considered to increase the risk of bleeding in patients with severe sepsis include temperature higher than 38\u00b0C, recent minor hemorrhage, rapid decrease in platelet count, and other coagulation abnormalities [203, 208, 209] . Patients with severe sepsis be treated with a combination of pharmacologic therapy and intermittent pneumatic compression devices whenever possible (grade 2C). 3. Septic patients who have a contraindication for heparin use (eg, thrombocytopenia, severe coagulopathy, active bleeding, recent intracerebral hemorrhage) not receive pharmacoprophylaxis (grade 1B), but receive mechanical prophylactic treatment, such as graduated compression stockings or intermittent compression devices (grade 2C), unless contraindicated. When the risk decreases start pharmacoprophylaxis (grade 2C). U. Stress ulcer prophylaxis 1. Stress ulcer prophylaxis using H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor be given to patients with severe sepsis/septic shock who have bleeding risk factors (grade 1B). 2. When stress ulcer prophylaxis is used, proton pump inhibitors rather than H2RA (grade 2D) 3. Patients without risk factors do not receive prophylaxis (grade 2B). V. Nutrition 1. Administer oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hours after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (grade 2C). 2. Avoid mandatory full caloric feeding in the first week but rather suggest low dose feeding (e.g., up to 500 calories per day), advancing only as tolerated (grade 2B). 3. Use intravenous glucose and enteral nutrition rather than total parenteral nutrition (TPN) alone or parenteral nutrition in conjunction with enteral feeding in the first 7 days after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (grade 2B). 4. Use nutrition with no specific immunomodulating supplementation rather than nutrition providing specific immunomodulating supplementation in patients with severe sepsis (grade 2C). W. Setting goals of care 1. Discuss goals of care and prognosis with patients and families (grade 1B). 2. Incorporate goals of care into treatment and end-of-life care planning, utilizing palliative care principles where appropriate (grade 1B). 3. Address goals of care as early as feasible, but no later than within 72 hours of ICU admission (grade 2C). of bias or did not state their criteria for the assessment of study quality, found significant improvement in patient mortality with IVIG treatment [219, 220] . In contrast to the most recent Cochrane review, Kreymann et al. [219] classified five studies that investigated IgM-enriched preparation as high-quality studies, combining studies in adults and neonates, and found an OR for mortality of 0.5 (95 % CI, 0.34-0.73).",

Selenium was administered in the hope that it could correct the known reduction of selenium concentration in sepsis patients and provide a pharmacologic effect through an antioxidant defense. Although some randomized controlled trials are available, the evidence on the use of intravenous selenium is still very weak. Only one large clinical trial has examined the effect on mortality rates, and no significant impact was reported on the intent-to-treat population with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock (OR, 0.66; 95 % CI, 0.39-1.10; P = 0.109) [221]. Overall, there was a trend toward a concentration-dependent reduction in mortality; no differences in secondary outcomes or adverse events were detected. Finally, no comment on standardization of sepsis management was included in this study, which recruited 249 patients over a period of 6 years (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) [221].

This is in accordance with 2 RCTs that resulted in reduced number of infectious episodes [224] or increase in glutathione peroxidase concentrations [225]; neither study, however, showed a beneficial effect on secondary outcome measures (renal replacement, ICU mortality) [224, 225] .",

Although the patients did receive continuous sedative infusions in this study, the daily interruption and awakening allowed for titration of sedation, in effect making the dosing intermittent. In addition, a paired spontaneous awakening trial combined with a spontaneous breathing trial decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, and 1-year mortality [284] . More recently, a multicenter randomized trial compared protocolized sedation with protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption in 423 critically ill mechanically ventilated medical and surgical patients [311] . There were no differences in duration of mechanical ventilation or lengths of stay between the groups; and daily interruption was associated with higher daily opioid and benzodiazepines doses, as well as higher nurse workload. Additionally, a randomized prospective blinded observational study demonstrated that although myocardial ischemia is common in critically ill ventilated patients, daily sedative interruption is not associated with an increased occurrence of myocardial ischemia [ An association between NMBA use and myopathies and neuropathies has been suggested by case studies and prospective observational studies in the critical care population [315, 319-322], but the mechanisms by which NMBAs produce or contribute to myopathies and neuropathies in these patients are unknown. Although no studies are specific to the septic patient population, it seems clinically prudent, based on existing knowledge, that NMBAs not be administered unless there is a clear indication for neuromuscular blockade that cannot be safely achieved with appropriate sedation and analgesia [315] .",

This lack of consensus about optimal dosing of intravenous insulin may reflect variability in patient factors (severity of illness, surgical vs medical settings), or practice patterns (e.g., approaches to feeding, intravenous dextrose) in the environments in which these protocols were developed and tested. Alternatively, some protocols may be more effective than others, conclusion supported by the wide variability in hypoglycemia rates reported with protocols [128, 326-333]. Thus, the use of established insulin protocols is important not only for clinical care but also for the conduct of clinical trials to avoid hypoglycemia, adverse events, and premature termination of trials before the efficacy signal, if any, can be determined. Several studies have suggested that computer-based algorithms result in tighter glycemic control with a reduced risk of hypoglycemia [355, 356] .

In particular, nine placebo-controlled RCTs of VTE prophylaxis have been conducted in general populations of acutely ill patients [381-389]. All trials showed reduction in DVT or pulmonary embolism, a benefit that is also supported by meta-analyses [390, 391] . Thus, the evidence strongly supports the value of VTE prophylaxis (grade 1A). The prevalence of infection/sepsis was 17 % in those studies in which this could be ascertained. One study investigated only ICU patients only, and 52 % of those enrolled had infection/sepsis. The need to extrapolate from general, acutely ill patients to critically ill patients to septic patients downgrades the evidence. That the effect is pronounced and the data are robust somewhat mitigate against the extrapolation, leading to a grade B determination.

The Canadian Critical Care Trials Group compared UFH (5000 IU twice daily) to LMWH (dalteparin, 5000 IU once per day and a second placebo injection to ensure parallel-group equivalence) [392] . No statistically significant difference in asymptomatic DVTs was found between the two groups (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95 % CI, 0.68-1.23; P = 0.57), but the proportion of patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism on CT scan, high-probability ventilation perfusion scan, or autopsy was significantly lower in the LMWH group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95 % CI, 0.30-0.88; P = 0.01).The study did not account for the use of other forms of LMWH. These data suggest that LMWH (dalteparin) is the treatment of choice over UFH administered twice daily in critically ill patients. Also, because the study included septic patients, the evidence supporting the use of dalteparin over twice daily UFH in critically ill, and perhaps septic, patients is strong. Similarly, a meta-analysis of acutely ill, general medical patients comparing UFH twice and thrice daily demonstrated that the latter regimen was more effective at preventing VTE, but twice daily dosing produced less bleeding [393] . Both critically ill and septic patients were included in these analyses, but their numbers are unclear. Nonetheless, the quality of evidence supporting the use of three times daily, as opposed to twice daily, UFH dosing in preventing VTE in acutely ill medical patients is high (A). However, comparing LMWH to twice daily UFH, or twice daily UFH to three times daily UFH, in sepsis requires extrapolation, downgrading the data. No data exist on direct comparison of LMWH to UFH administered three times daily, nor are there any studies directly comparing twice daily and thrice daily UFH dosing in septic or critically ill patients. Therefore, it is not possible to state that LMWH is superior to three times daily UFH or that three times daily dosing is superior to twice daily administration in sepsis. This downgrades the quality of the evidence and therefore the recommendation.",

None of the patients had bio-accumulation (trough antifactor Xa level lower than 0.06 IU/mL). The incidence of major bleeding was somewhat higher than in trials of other agents, but most other studies did not involve critically ill patients, in whom the bleeding risk is higher. Further, bleeding did not correlate with detectable trough levels [394] . Therefore, we recommend that dalteparin can be administered to critically ill patients with acute renal failure (A). Data on other LMWHs are lacking. Consequently, these forms should probably be avoided or, if used, anti-factor Xa levels should be monitored (grade 2C). UFH is not renally cleared and is safe (grade 1A).",

This analysis did not focus on sepsis or critically ill patients but included studies of prophylaxis after orthopedic, pelvic, and cardiac surgery. In addition, the type of pharmacologic prophylaxis varied, including UFH, LMWH, aspirin, and warfarin.

Early enteral nutrition has theoretical advantages in the integrity of gut mucosa and prevention of bacterial translocation and organ dysfunction, but also concerning is the risk of ischemia, mainly in hemodynamically unstable patients. Unfortunately, no clinical trial has specifically addressed early feeding in septic patients. Studies on different subpopulations of critically ill patients, mostly surgical patients, are not consistent, with great variability in the intervention and control groups; all are of low methodological quality [418-427] and none was individually powered for mortality, with very low mortality rates [418-420, 423, 426]. Authors of previously published meta-analyses of optimal nutrition strategies for the critically ill all reported that the studies they included had high heterogeneity and low quality [418] [419] [420] [421] [422] [423] [424] [425] [426] [427] [428] [429] [430] . Although no consistent effect on mortality was observed, there was evidence of benefit from some early enteral feeding on secondary outcomes, such as reduced incidence of infectious complications [ [428] . No evidence of harm was demonstrated in any of those studies. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to issue a strong recommendation, but the suggestion of benefit and absence of harm supports a suggestion that some enteral feeding is warranted.",

In another study, mortality was greater with higher feeding, but differences in feeding strategies were modest and the sample size was small [435] . Therefore, evidence is insufficient to support an early target of full caloric intake and, indeed, some possibility of harm exists. Underfeeding (60-70 % of target) or trophic feeding (upper limit of 500 kcal) is probably a better nutritional strategy in the first week of severe sepsis/septic shock. This upper limit for trophic feeding is a somewhat arbitrary number, but based in part on the fact that the two recent studies used a range of 240-480 kcal [433, 434].",

            "text": "Rationale. Three RCTs compared the use of colloid to crystalloid resuscitation in children with hypovolemic dengue shock with near 100 % survival in all treatment arms [542] [543] [544] . In the industrialized world, two beforeand-after studies observed tenfold reductions in mortality when children with purpura/meningococcal septic shock were treated with fluid boluses, inotropes, and mechanical ventilation in the community emergency department [545, 546] . In one randomized trial, septic shock mortality was reduced (40-12 %) when increased fluid boluses, blood, and inotropes were given to attain a ScvO 2 monitoring goal of greater than 70 % [511]. A quality improvement study achieved a reduction in severe sepsis mortality (from 4.0 to 2.4 %) with the delivery of fluid boluses and antibiotics in the first hour in a pediatric emergency department to reverse clinical signs of shock [547]. Children normally have a lower blood pressure than adults, and a fall in blood pressure can be prevented by vasoconstriction and increasing heart rate. Therefore, blood pressure alone is not a reliable endpoint for assessing the adequacy of resuscitation. However, once hypotension occurs, cardiovascular collapse may soon follow. Thus, fluid resuscitation is recommended for both normotensive and hypotensive children in hypovolemic shock [542] [543] [544] [545] [546] [547] [548] [549] [550] [551] [552] [553] [554] . Because hepatomegaly and/or rales occur in children who are fluid overloaded, these findings can be helpful signs of hypervolemia. In the absence of these signs, large fluid deficits can exist, and initial volume resuscitation can require 40-60 mL/kg or more; however, if these signs are present, then fluid administration should be ceased and diuretics should be given. Inotrope infusions and mechanical ventilation are commonly required for children with fluid refractory shock. H. Blood products and plasma therapies 1. We suggest similar hemoglobin targets in children as in adults. During resuscitation of low superior vena cava oxygen saturation shock (\\70 %), hemoglobin levels of 10 g/dL are targeted. After stabilization and recovery from shock and hypoxemia, then a lower target [7.0 g/dL can be considered reasonable (grade 1B).",

Blood transfusion is recommended by the World Health Organization for severe anemia, hemoglobin value \\5 g/ dL, and acidosis. A RCT of early goal-directed therapy for pediatric septic shock using the threshold hemoglobin of 10 g/dL for patients with a SvcO 2 saturation less than 70 % in the first 72 h of pediatric ICU admission showed improved survival in the multimodal intervention arm [511].",

In these patients, physicians generally transition from conventional pressure control ventilation to pressure release ventilation (airway pressure release ventilation) or to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. These modes maintain oxygenation with higher mean airway pressures using an ''open'' lung ventilation strategy. To be effective, these modes can require a mean airway pressure 5 cmH 2 O higher than that used with conventional ventilation.

An RCT of strict glycemic control compared to moderate control using insulin in a pediatric ICU population found a reduction in mortality with an increase in hypoglycemia. Insulin therapy should only be conducted with frequent glucose monitoring in view of the risks for hypoglycemia which can be greater in newborns and children due to a) relative lack of glycogen stores and muscle mass for gluconeogenesis, and b) the heterogeneity of the population with some excreting no endogenous insulin and others demonstrating high insulin levels and insulin resistance [622] [623] [624] [625] [626] [627] [628] .",

This benefit should be applicable to patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. In addition, the risk factors for GI bleeding (e.g., coagulopathy, mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h, possibly hypotension) are frequently present in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock [407, 408]. Patients without these risk factors are unlikely (0.2 %; 95 % CI, 0.02-0.5) to have clinically important bleeding [407]. Both old and new meta-analyses show prophylaxisinduced reduction in clinically significant upper GI bleeding, which we consider significant even in the absence of proven mortality benefit [409-411]. The benefit of prevention of upper GI bleeding must be weighed against the potential (unproven) effect of increased stomach pH on a greater incidence of VAP and C. difficile infection [409, 412, 413]. (See Supplemental Digital Content 6, 7 and 8, Summary of Evidence Tables for effects of treatments on specific outcomes.) In an exploratory hypothesis, we considered (as did the authors of the meta-analysis) [411] the possibility of less benefit and more harm in prophylaxis among patients receiving enteral nutrition but decided to provide one recommendation while lowering the quality of evidence. The balance of benefits and risks may thus depend on the individual patient's characteristics as well as on the local epidemiology of VAP and C. difficile infections. The rationale for considering only suppression of acid production (and not sucralfate) is based on the study of 1,200 patients by Cook et al. [414] comparing H 2 blockers and sucralfate. More recent meta-analyses provide low-quality evidence suggesting more effective GI bleeding protection with the use of proton pump inhibitors than with H2RA [415-417].

One larger multicenter RCT (n = 624) [210] in adult patients and one large multinational RCT in infants with neonatal sepsis (n = 3,493) [211] found no benefit for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). (For more on this trial, see ''Pediatric considerations in severe sepsis''.). A meta-analysis by the Cochrane collaboration, which did not include this most recent RCT, identified 10 polyclonal IVIG trials (n = 1,430) and seven trials on Also the subgroup of IgM-enriched IVIGs (n = 7 trials) showed a significant reduction in mortality rates compared with placebo (RR, 0.66; 95 % CI, 0.51-0.85). Trials with low risk of bias showed no reduction in mortality with polyclonal IVIG (RR, 0.97; 95 % CI, 0.81-1.15; five trials, n = 945). Three of these trials [210, 213, 214] used standard polyclonal IVIG and two IgM-enriched IVIG [215, 216]. These findings are in accordance with those of 2 older meta-analyses [217, 218] from other Cochrane authors. One systematic review [217] included a total of 21 trials and showed a relative risk of death of 0.77 with immunoglobulin treatment (95 % CI, 0.68-0.88); however, the results of only high-quality trials (total of 763 patients) showed a relative risk of 1.02 (95 % CI, 0.84-1.24).

The drug was withdrawn from the market and is no longer available, negating any need for an SSC recommendation regarding its use. O. Mechanical ventilation of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome 1. We recommend that clinicians target a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight in patients with sepsisinduced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (grade 1A vs. 12 mL/kg). 2. We recommend that plateau pressures be measured in patients with ARDS and that the initial upper limit goal for plateau pressures in a passively inflated lung be B 30 cmH 2 O (grade 1B). Rationale. Of note, studies used to determine recommendations in this section enrolled patients using criteria from the American-European Consensus Criteria Definition for Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and ARDS [232]. For this document, we have used the updated Berlin definition and used the terms mild, moderate, and severe ARDS (PaO 2 / FIO 2 B300, B200, and B100 mm Hg, respectively) for the syndromes previously known as ALI and ARDS [233]. Several multicenter randomized trials have been performed in patients with established ARDS to evaluate the effects of limiting inspiratory pressure through moderation of tidal volume [234-238]. These studies showed differing results that may have been caused by differences in airway pressures in the treatment and control groups [233, 234, 239]. Several meta-analyses suggest decreased mortality in patients with a pressure-and volume-limited strategy for established ARDS [240, 241].The largest trial of a volume-and pressure-limited strategy showed an absolute 9 % decrease in all-cause mortality in patients with ARDS ventilated with tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg compared with 12 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW), and aiming for a plateau pressure B30 cm H 2 O [233]. The use of lung-protective strategies for patients with ARDS is supported by clinical trials and has been widely accepted, but the precise choice of tidal volume for an individual patient with ARDS may require adjustment for such factors as the plateau pressure achieved, the level of PEEP chosen, the compliance of the thoracoabdominal compartment, and the vigor of the patient's breathing effort. Patients with profound metabolic acidosis, high obligate minute ventilations, or short stature may require additional manipulation of tidal volumes. Some clinicians believe it may be safe to ventilate with tidal volumes[6 mL/kg PBW as long as the plateau pressure can be maintained B30 cm H 2 O [242, 243]. The validity of this ceiling value will depend on the patient's effort, as those who are actively breathing generate higher transalveolar pressures for a given plateau pressure than patients who are passively inflated. Conversely, patients with very stiff chest walls may require plateau pressures [30 cmH 2 O to meet vital clinical objectives. A retrospective study suggested that tidal volumes should be lowered even with plateau pressures B30 cmH 2 O [244] as lower plateau pressures were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality [245].",

            "text": "Rationale. Raising PEEP in ARDS keeps lung units open to participate in gas exchange. This will increase PaO 2 when PEEP is applied through either an endotracheal tube or a face mask[252][253][254]. In animal experiments, avoidance of end-expiratory alveolar collapse helps minimize ventilator-induced lung injury when relatively high plateau pressures are in use. Three large multicenter trials using higher versus lower levels of PEEP in conjunction with low tidal volumes did not uncover benefit or harm[255][256][257]. A meta-analysis using individual patient data showed no benefit in all patients with ARDS; however, patients with moderate or severe ARDS (Pao 2 /FIo 2 ratio B200 mm Hg) had decreased mortality with the use of higher PEEP, whereas those with mild ARDS did not[258]. Two options are recommended for PEEP titration. One option is to titrate PEEP (and tidal volume) according to bedside measurements of thoracopulmonary compliance with the objective of obtaining the best compliance, reflecting a favorable balance of lung recruitment and overdistension[259]. The second option is to titrate PEEP based on severity of oxygenation deficit and guided by the FIo2  required to maintain adequate oxygenation [234, 255, 256]. A PEEP[5 cm H 2 0 is usually required to avoid lung collapse [260]. The ARDSNet standard PEEP strategy is shown in Appendix 3. The higher PEEP strategy recommended for ARDS is shown in Appendix 4 and comes from the ALVEOLI trial [257]. We suggest prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio B100 mmHg in facilities that have experience with such practices (grade 2B). Rationale. Many strategies exist for treating refractory hypoxemia in patients with severe ARDS [261]. Temporarily raising transpulmonary pressure may facilitate opening atelectatic alveoli to permit gas exchange [260], but could also overdistend aerated lung units leading to ventilator-induced lung injury and temporary hypotension. The application of transient sustained use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) appears to improve oxygenation in patients initially, but these effects can be transient [262]. Although selected patients with severe hypoxemia may benefit from recruitment maneuvers in conjunction with higher levels of PEEP, little evidence supports the routine use in all ARDS patients [262]. Blood pressure and oxygenation should be monitored and recruitment maneuvers discontinued if deterioration in these variables is observed. Several small studies and one large study in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure or ARDS have shown that most patients respond to the prone position with improved oxygenation [263-266]. None of the individual trials of prone positioning in patients with ARDS or hypoxemic respiratory failure demonstrated a mortality benefit [267-270]. One meta-analysis suggested potential benefits for prone positioning in patients with profound hypoxemia and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio B100 mmHg, but not in those with less severe hypoxemia [270]. Prone positioning may be associated with potentially life-threatening complications, including accidental dislodging of the endotracheal and chest tubes; these complications occur more frequently in patients in the prone compared with supine position [270]. Other methods to treat refractory hypoxemia, including high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [271], may be considered as rescue therapies in centers with expertise and experience with their use [261, 271-274]. Inhaled nitric oxide does not improve mortality rates in patients with ARDS and should not be routinely used [275]. 7. We recommend that mechanically ventilated sepsis patients be maintained with the head of the bed elevated between 30 and 45 degrees to limit aspiration risk and to prevent the development of VAP (grade 1B). Rationale. The semi-recumbent position has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of VAP [276]. Enteral feeding increased the risk of developing VAP; 50 % of the patients who were fed enterally in the supine position developed VAP compared with 9 % of those fed in the semirecumbent position [276]. However, the bed position was monitored only once a day, and patients who did not achieve the desired bed elevation were not included in the analysis [276]. One study did not show a difference in incidence of VAP between patients maintained in supine and semirecumbent positions [277]; patients assigned to the semirecumbent group did not consistently achieve the desired head of the bed elevation, and the head of bed elevation in the supine group approached that of the semi-recumbent group by day 7 [277]. When necessary, patients may be laid flat for procedures, hemodynamic measurements, and during episodes of hypotension. Patients should not be fed enterally while supine. 8. We suggest that noninvasive mask ventilation (NIV) be used in that minority of sepsis-induced ARDS patients in whom the benefits of NIV have been carefully considered and are thought to outweigh the risks (grade 2B). Rationale. Obviating the need for airway intubation confers multiple advantages: better communication, lower incidence of infection, and reduced requirements for sedation. Two RCTs in patients with acute respiratory failure demonstrated improved outcome with the use of NIV when it can be used successfully [278, 279]. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of sepsis patients with life-threatening hypoxemia can be managed in this way [280, 281]. NIV should be considered in patients with sepsisinduced ARDS if they are responsive to relatively low levels of pressure support and PEEP with stable hemodynamics, can be made comfortable, and are easily arousable; if they are able to protect the airway and spontaneously clear the airway of secretions; and if they are anticipated to recover rapidly from the precipitating insult [280, 281]. A low threshold for airway intubation should be maintained. 9. We recommend that a weaning protocol be in place and that mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis undergo spontaneous breathing trials regularly to evaluate the ability to discontinue mechanical ventilation when they satisfy the following criteria: (a) arousable; (b) hemodynamically stable (without vasopressor agents); (c) no new potentially serious conditions; (d) low ventilatory and end-expiratory pressure requirements; and (e) low FiO 2 requirements which can be safely delivered with a face mask or nasal cannula. If the spontaneous breathing trial is successful, extubation should be considered (grade 1A). 10. We recommend against the routine use of the pulmonary artery catheter for patients with sepsisinduced ARDS (grade 1A). trial [302]. Three hundred twenty-six patients with ARDS, 251 of whom had pulmonary or nonpulmonary sepsis as cause, were randomized to intravenous salbutatmol, 15 lg/kg of ideal body weight, or placebo for up to 7 days. Patients treated with salbutamol had increased 28-day mortality rates (34 vs. 23 %; RR, 1.4; 95 % CI, 1.03-2.08) leading to early termination of the trial [302]. b 2 -agonists may have specific indications, such as treatment of bronchospasm and hyperkalemia. In the absence of these conditions, we recommend against the routine use of b-agonists, either in intravenous or aerosolized form, for the treatment of patients with sepsisinduced ARDS. Clinical trials have evaluated daily interruption of continuous sedative infusions. A prospective, randomized controlled trial in 128 mechanically ventilated adults receiving continuous intravenous sedation demonstrated that a daily interruption in the continuous sedative infusion until the patient was awake decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay[310].",

            "text": "Rationale. Although NMBAs are often administered to critically ill patients, their role in the ICU is not well defined. No evidence exists that neuromuscular blockade in this patient population reduces mortality or major morbidity. In addition, no studies have been published that specifically address the use of NMBAs in septic patients.The most common indication for NMBA use in the ICU is to facilitate mechanical ventilation[314]. When appropriately used, these agents may improve chest wall compliance, prevent respiratory dyssynchrony, and reduce peak airway pressures[315]. Muscle paralysis may also reduce oxygen consumption by decreasing the work of breathing and respiratory muscle blood flow [316]. However, a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with severe sepsis demonstrated that oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and gastric intramucosal pH were not improved during deep neuromuscular blockade[317].A recent randomized clinical trial of continuous infusions of cisatracurium in patients with early ARDS and a PaO 2 /FIO 2 \\150 mm Hg showed improved adjusted survival rates and more organ failure-free days without an increased risk in ICU-acquired weakness compared with placebo-treated patients[318]. The investigators used a high fixed dose of cisatracurium without train-of-four monitoring, and half of the patients in the placebo group received at least a single dose of NMBA. Whether another NMBA would have similar effects is unknown. Although many of the patients enrolled into this trial appeared to meet sepsis criteria, it is not clear whether similar results would occur in sepsis patients.

            "text": "Friedrich et al. [336], using within-trial comparisons, showed no benefit for surgical patients in mixed medical-surgical ICUs [risk ratio 0.99 (0.82-1.11)] and no subgroup of surgical patients who benefited from intensive insulin therapy. Interestingly, the RCTs that reported [326, 337] compared intensive insulin therapy to high controls (180-200 mg/dL) [OR 0.89 (0.73-1.09)], whereas those that did not demonstrate benefit [330-332] compared intensive therapy to moderate controls (108-180 mg/dL) [OR 1.14 (1.02 to -1.26)]. See Supplemental Digital Content 6 for details.The trigger to start an insulin protocol for blood glucose levels [180 mg/dL with an upper target blood glucose level \\180 mg/dL derives from the NICE-SUGAR study[331], which used these values for initiating and stopping therapy. The NICE-SUGAR trial is the largest, most compelling study to date on glucose control in ICU patients given its inclusion of multiple ICUs and hospitals and a general patient population. Several medical organizations, including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, American College of Physicians, and Society of Critical Care Medicine, have published consensus statements for glycemic control of hospitalized patients [338-341]. These statements usually targeted glucose levels between 140 and 180 mg/dL. As there is no evidence that targets between 140 and 180 mg/ dL are different from targets of 110-140 mg/dL, the recommendations use an upper target blood glucose B180 mg/dL without a lower target other than hypoglycemia. Treatment should avoid hyperglycemia ([180 mg/ dL), hypoglycemia, and wide swings in glucose levels. The continuation of insulin infusions, especially with the cessation of nutrition, has been identified as a risk factor for hypoglycemia[332]. Balanced nutrition may be associated with a reduced risk of hypoglycemia[342]. Several studies have suggested that the variability in glucose levels over time is an important determinant of mortality[343][344][345]. Hyperglycemia and glucose variability seem to be unassociated with increased mortality rates in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic patients[346, 347].Several factors may affect the accuracy and reproducibility of point-of-care testing of blood capillary blood glucose, including the type and model of the device used, user expertise, and patient factors, including hematocrit (false elevation with anemia),PaO  2 , and drugs [348]. Plasma glucose values by capillary point-of-care testing have been found to be inaccurate with frequent false elevations [349] over the range of glucose levels [350], but especially in the hypoglycemic [349, 351] and hyperglycemic ranges [351] and in hypotensive patients [352] or patients receiving catecholamines [353]. A review of 12 published insulin infusion protocols for critically ill patients showed wide variability in dose recommendations and variable glucose control [354]",
