Correctional and public health systems must coordinate individual responsibilities throughout the outbreak. Preventive medicine physicians and public health departments should assist with pandemic plan creation and implementation as appropriate for each correctional setting. Policy changes should be considered to facilitate active oversight of these facilities.\u2022\nCoordinate between correctional facilities. Arrange for sharing of information, physical resources, or transfer of prisoners. Maintain contact throughout the outbreak.\u2022\nIdentify, treat. Screen all prisoners and staff on entry. Urge symptom reporting from prisoners and staff. Establish clear, evidence-based policies for symptomatic individuals and ensure testing availability for prisoners and staff. Eliminate medical copays for prisoners.\u2022\nRelease prisoners, decrease admissions. Decrease intakes and utilize alternatives to incarceration such as community monitoring. Employ compassionate release for elderly and infirm prisoners. Expedite release or furlough of prisoners who pose relatively low public safety risks, including nearly all people in immigrant detention. Identify prisoners at higher risk of homelessness, unemployment, substance abuse, or becoming victims of violence and arrange for appropriate resources, including medications for addiction treatment, at discharge.\u2022\nImprove sanitation. Provide soap and tissue at no cost to prisoners and relax restrictions on hand sanitizer. Ensure adequate personal protective equipment. Increase laundry services.\u2022\nEmploy social distancing. Establish clear policies for social distancing and criteria for escalation based on likely transmission. Restrict transfers, medical appointments, or court appearances to those that are absolutely necessary. Assign housing to permit more space between prisoners. Establish separate spaces for isolation and quarantine; these should not resemble conditions of solitary confinement.\u2022\nPlan for staff absences. Identify critical functions and cross-train coworkers. Retain additional contingency staff. Provide longer-term prescriptions for prisoners to keep on person. Make sick leave and medical coverage available for quarantined and infected staff.\u2022\nSupport mental health. Communicate situation reports clearly and often. Provide education to all stakeholders, including prisoners. Train staff to recognize burnout in colleagues and agitation in prisoners. Provide mental health support, modified schedules, or assignments to staff as able. Avoid lockdown if possible. Provide prisoners with additional activities and increased access to communication with their families.\n",

Today, correctional workers and prisoners are under severe threat, but when correctional institutions and the outside community collaborate for the safety of their workers and residents, all will be better protected against COVID-19 illness and death.",
