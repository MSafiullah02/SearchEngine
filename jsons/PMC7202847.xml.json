Worldwide, social distancing and self-quarantine are currently the only protective measures to slow the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and help to keep the novel coronavirus from overwhelming the healthcare systems.

As coronavirus requires acidification of endosomes for proper functioning [12], it is speculated that a pH increase in intracellular compartments might be one important inhibiting effect of CQ and probably of HCQ in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [8].",

In the context of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, zinc deficiency may be relevant for the outcome of patient populations with severe clinical courses of COVID-19 including elderly patients, patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, or chronic obstructive lung disease. In addition, hypertensive and cardiovascular disease patients are frequently treated with hydrochlorothiazide, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin 2 receptor antagonists which can result in an increased urinary excretion of zinc with subsequent systemic zinc deficiency [17]. Zinc deficiency was also demonstrated in diabetic patients [18]. Decreased zinc plasma levels are even present in a large number of healthy elderly patients [19]. The NHANES III study demonstrated that 35%\u201345% of adults aged 60 years or older had zinc intakes below the estimated average requirement of 6.8 mg/day for elderly females and 9.4 mg/day for elderly males. 20%\u201325% of older adults still had inadequate zinc intakes even when intakes from both food and dietary supplements were considered [20]. It may be speculated that also younger adults or even infants and adolescents with present zinc deficiency could be at higher risk for severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, we hypothesize that effective zinc supplementation during treatment of COVID-19 with CQ and HCQ, which have zinc ionophore characteristics, may result in increased intracellular zinc levels in general and in lysosomes specifically. Higher intracellular zinc levels might result in a more efficient RdRp inhibition and consequently a more effective inhibition of intracellular SARS-CoV-2 replication, potentially improving clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ. Whether this accumulation and treatment effect may sufficiently occur in relevant pulmonary tissue of COVID-19 patients has to be confirmed.",

            "text": "Due to the existing substantial evidence, we propose to amend current clinical trial designs to test this hypothesis in the treatment of COVID-19 patients by including at least one treatment arm with oral CQ or HCQ in combination with zinc. However, because of the better clinical safety profile HCQ should be preferred. To avoid interindividual differences of oral absorption rates and because of possible gastrointestinal side effects of oral zinc supplementation, it is especially for inpatients proposed to use parenteral zinc preparations which are approved and clinically already used. For outpatients at expected high risk to develop severe COVID-19, oral administration of sufficient doses of zinc should be considered. Supplementation of zinc is known to be clinically relatively safe if dosing ranges and upper limits of dosing are based on recommended dietary allowances [20]. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial oral zinc supplementation with 45 mg zinc per day for 12 months demonstrated a significant lower incidence of infections in the elderly and was very well tolerated [21].",

In the comparator arm, similar daily doses of HCQ should be combined with parenteral or oral zinc. As comprehensive zinc dose findings studies may currently not be feasible but as sufficient clinical safety needs to be ensured, we recommend administering zinc in the range of the upper limit of dosing based on recommended dietary allowances [20]. So, for a male or female adult patient with normal renal function and no contraindications a parenteral daily dose of 40 mg zinc could be implemented. Dependent on observed tolerability, safety, and growing clinical experience the total daily dose of zinc could be further increased or decreased at the discretion of the physician.",

Important advantages of using CQ or preferably HCQ in combination with zinc are the broad availability, affordability, and demonstrated efficacy and safety in approved and clinically established indications. The European Medicines Agency recommends using CQ or HCQ only in clinical trials or emergency use programs [22]. Whether zinc supplementation in combination with CQ/HCQ should be recommended for high risk or also younger patients outside of clinical trials, as a prevention or treatment approach during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, should be currently considered only on a case-by-case basis.",
