Imaging was obtained and recorded using a slow scrolling display speed [< 25 mm (mm) per second], allowing the analysis (from end-expiration to end-inspiration), measurement and average of 3 consecutive respiratory cycles on the same screen (Fig. 1a). Imaging quality check included regularity in amplitude and frequency of the DE and visibility of the diaphragmatic line throughout the respiratory cycle. In each patient, to ensure that all measurements were made from the same acoustic window, the distance between probe placement and the lower extremity of the ribcage on the mid-axillary line was measured and used as the reference site for the subsequent exams. Under normal quiet breathing conditions, hemidiaphragm dysfunction was defined as an excursion < 1 cm (cm) downwards during inspiration, and diaphragmatic paralysis corresponded to an absence of motion (0 cm) or a paradoxical motion (diaphragmatic ascension during inspiration) [8].",

In 36% of these patients, the reduction in DE was seemingly severe enough to be graded as \u201cdysfunction\u201d according to current criteria [8]. Nevertheless, this greater reduction in excursion was also transient and showed rapid recovery by D3. Based on a clinical uneventful course for our patient population, such dysfunction is probably benign in nature.

Excursion measurements were made between forced expiration and maximal inspiration requiring patient\u2019s cooperation, whereas we studied patients breathing normally, without effort. This accounts for the difference between a \u2212 40% reduction in diaphragmatic excursion decrease observed in the study by Lerolle et al. [6] and the one found in this study (\u2212 17%). We chose to avoid forced inspiration because the ability to mobilize a vital capacity in the postoperative period is impaired by postoperative pain and is highly variable among patients. This also allowed us to obtain our values by averaging 3 consecutive respiratory cycles, thereby avoiding selection bias.",

Diaphragmatic thickening during inspiration has the theoretical advantage of better reflecting the active contraction of muscle bundles [13]. While this may hold true in mechanically ventilated patients [13], such difference was not apparent from our study. Moreover, since obtaining appropriate acoustic windows for thickening imaging can be quite difficult and sometimes even impossible (34% failure rate in our cohort), excursion appears as an easier measurement to assess the function of the diaphragm in spontaneously breathing patients. To further compare both methodologies, we undertook a reproducibility sub-study, evaluating excursion and thickening measured twice in the same patients by two different operators. Visual analysis and numerical comparison show that both methods are reproducible, although they seem to suggest that excursion is a more reproducible metric of diaphragm function than thickening. Previous authors found a good reproducibility for each parameter when measured individually [8, 10].The small disparity we encountered may be a reflection of the difference between the magnitude of excursion (centimeters) and thickening (millimeters) measurements. Due to the very small values of diaphragm thicknesses, any inaccuracy in the placement of the cursors can result in proportionately greater errors in the percentage of thickening. Finally, the correlation of diaphragmatic thickness and excursion was moderate. This finding may be interpreted as another reason to use excursion instead of thickening to assess diaphragmatic function due to the inherent measurement errors with the latter.",

We did not quantitatively assess the influence of pain (e.g. visual assessment score, analgesic dose) during image acquisition, although any meaningful impact was probably minimized by assuring that all exams were performed during quiet, unassisted breathing. Furthermore, owing to the small size of our population, interpreting the lack of association between variables such as topical hypothermia or COPD and diaphragmatic dysfunction should be made with caution. Finally, we only provide information on patients without respiratory impairment, and therefore cannot extrapolate on the role of diaphragmatic dysfunction in patients with respiratory distress or difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation following cardiac surgery, similarly to what has been proposed by some authors in different clinical settings [14].",
