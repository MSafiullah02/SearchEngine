Linear genomes often contain conserved terminal sequences. When complementary, these allow partial circularization of the genome or formation of panhandle or tube-like structures.

In the early phase, processing of viral structural proteins occurs slowly, due to the low concentrations of mature viral proteases. Viral complementary RNA is synthesized, followed by new viral RNA. As the viral proteases accumulate, core proteins are more efficiently processed, assemble and begin to encapsidate viral RNA. This strategy is used by picornaviruses and flaviviridae, including hepatitis C viruses. In other (+)ssRNA virus families (e.g. togaviridae, coronaviridae, caliciviridae and hepatitis E virus), the viral complementary RNA serves not only for production of full length vRNA, but also subgenomic transcripts encoding structural proteins, allowing regulation of expression.",

The distinction is based on the ability of one group of bacteria, the Gram-positives, to retain a crystal violet-iodine dye in the presence of an organic solvent such as alcohol or acetone. The solvent dissolves the dye from Gram-negatives and they can be counterstained with other dyes such as safranin. This simple observation reflects distinctive structures. Gram-positive bacteria characteristically have a thick cell wall made up mainly of a vast molecule of peptidoglycan, with protruding chains of teichoic acids. Surrounding the peptidoglycan skeleton in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria is an additional asymmetric outer membrane, the outer layer composed of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) (Fig. 1.4\n). Escherichia coli is an example of a Gram-negative bacterium; it is rod shaped and growing cells are between 2 \u03bcm and 4 \u03bcm long.",

Although the interaction between adhesins and cell receptors may be highly specific, this is not always the case. The specificity can be tested by artificially blocking adherence with an excess of purified adhesin or receptor or with antibodies directed against one of these two. The specificity accounts for the early observation that many pathogens distinctively infect certain areas or organs of the body and not others. For instance, Strep. pneumoniae causes pneumonia but not urethritis, whereas Neisseria gonorrhoeae exhibits the opposite pattern of specificity. The receptors for poliovirus, rhinovirus and HIV are expressed only by specific cell types, restricting virus infection accordingly. Different strains of influenza virus adhere via the hemagglutinin to different sialic acids, and this largely determines not only their host range but also their organ tropism. These and many other examples support the notion that adhesins determine the tropism of microbial pathogens. On the other hand, cell receptors for many organisms are ubiquitous and these organisms have no tissue or even host restriction, possibly because they encode many adhesins.

It occurs when the pathogen invades the intestinal mucosa and causes structural damage to the intestine. The immunologic protection of the intestine is performed by the gut-associated lymphoid tissues, which are separated from the intestinal lumen by epithelium. The follicle-associated epithelium is covered by membranous cells (M cells) that play a prominent role because they are specialized in the transport of antigens. Enteroinvasive viruses, protozoa and bacteria exploit the transport facilities provided by M cells to invade the host. Entry into (and passage through) M cells by these pathogens is preceded by adherence. While its pathogenicity is uncertain, enteric infection by mammalian reovirus type 1 involves initial entry through M cells mediated by the capsid proteins \u03c31 and \u00b51.32 Infection by poliovirus may proceed by a similar route.33\n",

Entry is facilitated by the products encoded by the internalin (inl) family of genes, which seem to confer tropism for different cell types. Once inside the cell, L. monocytogenes remains confined to the phagosome for only a short time. Following lysis of the endosomal membrane, it escapes into the cytosol. Membrane lysis is achieved by a production of listeriolysin-O, which attains maximum activity under the acidic conditions of the intravacuolar environment. Once in the cytosol, the bacteria multiply and migrate towards the plasma membrane by using the actin-based mechanism as described above. Actin polymerization is mediated by the L. monocytogenes protein ActA, localized at one end of the bacterium. For spread to neighboring cells, L. monocytogenes requires bacterial lecithinase and phospholipase C, which stimulate lysis of the two membranes that separate the bacterium from the cytoplasm of the newly infected cell. Interestingly, most of the virulence genes associated with this process are clustered in a single region of the L. monocytogenes chromosome. By spreading in this manner the bacteria are not exposed to human and cellular defenses. However, the intracytoplasmic bacteria stimulate cell innate immune responses via Nod signaling.",

Pathogens such as Strep. pneumoniae that secrete a sialidase can remove sialic acids from host platelets that are then cleared from the circulation by the Ashwell receptor.

The characteristic measles rash is produced by infiltration of lymphocytes including CTLs attacking skin cells infected by the measles virus.

Many so-called extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli are hemolytic because they produce an RTX membrane toxin that damages PMNs, impairing their function in several ways, depending on the local concentration of the toxin. Several toxins from Clostridium perfringens produce similar effects. Indeed, pus sampled from gas gangrene may contain numerous Gram-positive rods without any visible PMNs.",

Measles virus infects macrophages and both B and T lymphocytes, interfering with the immunocompetence of the host for weeks after resolution of clinical disease. As a consequence, in areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, measles epidemics may be followed by outbreaks of tuberculosis. Gonococci, meningococci and Haemophilus influenzae produce proteases that hydrolyze secretory IgA1 antibodies. Protease-negative mutants of these bacterial strains are less virulent, suggesting a role for mucosal IgA1 antibodies in host defense against these pathogens.",
