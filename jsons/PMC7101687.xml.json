The authors found that lower admission O2 saturation, diffuse alveolar infiltrate on admission, corticosteroid treatment in children with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and presence of ARDS was associated with increased mortality in children with pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza infection. The fact that mechanical ventilation was required on admission in patients who died, suggests that these children presented late in the course of their illness. Late presentation to the health care system remains a major challenge in influenza pandemics and is frequently associated with poor outcomes, including higher risk of mortality. Mass media and community efforts during a pandemic need to emphasize earlier presentation to health care centers equipped to address pandemic influenza with special care taken to transfer critically ill patients in well equipped ambulances.",
