Intensive therapy for elderly patients continues to concern health care professionals and patients alike ~nd the appropriate allocation of resources requires some knowledge of outcome. We have studied 209 admissions of 202 elderly patients, aged 75 years and over, to assess the efficacy of such treatment. Records of admission to two ITUs were reviewed over the period of [1983] [1984] . The community hospital ITU had an increased proportion of elderly admissions compared with the teaching hospital -153/922 admissions (16.6%) and 56/1445 admissions (3.9%) respeetlvely,p O.001 -but the distribution of ages (median 79, range 75-100 years) and length of stay of the patients (median 3, range 1-25 days) were similar in the two units. There was a highly significant difference in overall mortality rates between the two ITUs -9.9% in the teaching hospital compared with 17.8% in the community hospltal (p(O.O01). However, there was no difference in mortality when only elderly admissions were considered (13% in the teaching hospital, 21.7% in the community hospital). Elderly patients were grouped into 3 categories: 50 (2~) medical emergencies, gO (40%) elective surgical cases and 72 (36%) surgical emergencies. More elective surgery patients survived ITU admission but mechanical ventilation was associated with a significantly (p (0.01) reduced survival (76% compared with 89% in spontaneously breathing patients). This difference was not evident at hospital discharge (55% v 67%). Overall, 80.7% of elderly patients survived ITU admission hut hospital survival fell to 59%. At three months following discharge, 47.5% of patients were still alive (79% having returned to their own homes, the remainder being in 'sheltered' accomadation). These results demonstrate that age, by itself, should not be a consideration in the allocation of Intensive Therapy resources. PRN is an objective chronometric method for measuring nursing caves. This method was performed by a QUEBEC'S Team in Montreal in 1980. We applied PRN in an intensive care unit (ICU) in 88 patients. 879 sheets were consecutively performed by the nurses during S months ist D@c 84 -31 March 85. We compared score PRN with a severity of deesease classification system in ICU patients the simplified acute physiologic score (SAPS) (2) We compared PRN with s method for quantitative eomparalson of patient care the therapeutic intervention scoring system (TISS) (3) Correlation between SAPS and PRN first Day (PRN Jl) was r = O,51 p < O.OO1 Correlation between Tiss and PRN Jl was r = 0,72 p ~O.001 PRN Jl is hyghly corelated r = 0,9 p < 0.001 to total PRN when multiplicating with the number days of hospitalisation of each patient. In conclusion PRN is an objective Indies for measuring nursing cares. Ii could be useful for giving to others methods measuring nursing cares a chronometrie value. An aggressive approach of acute complications in hematologic patients is usually estimated as doomed to failure. To evaluate the efficacy of mechanical ventilation (M.V.), hemodialysis (H. D.) and invasive hemmdynamie monitoring of shock (H.M.)~ we studied 52 patients (average age ~99 years -18) over a period of two years. 29 patients had a marrow failure (average duration 9.8 days). 44 patients required a M.V. due to ARDS (16) or extensive pneumonia (28). 17 patients needed a H.D. for anuria related to a septic shock (15) or metabolic disorders (2) . 22 patients required H.M. for septic (19) or eardiogenie shock (3). The recovery was obtained in 11/52 patients (21%) In case of aplasia, the success of the therapy was 24 %. The evaluation of the SAPS index only showed a slight difference between the survivors (12-~. t5.3) and deads (17.8 7.8) [p < O,O5 ]. From the findings of this preliminary study, we conclude that an aggressive management seems quite justified in hematologic patients. However, when two or more such treatments are needed, the mortality rate dramatically increases. In order $o ascertain which is the proper moment for severity of illnes evaluation in patients admitted to a general ICU~ and so be able to stablish a survival outcome prognosis approach~ 500 consecutive admissions %o our multidisciplinary ICU have been studied. All patients were evaluated according to simplified APACHE system.Scorings were calculated at the admission time and 24 hours later, using for this last calculalion the worst available data for that period. Survivors and non-survivers (after a whole hospitalary stay follow up) have significant different scorings at the admission time and 24 h. later, and this was also valid for coronary and non-coronary subgroups. The ability of the system for clearly discriminate between survivors and non-survivors at any score value 7 ~as tested by means of the ROC curves eonstructed~ and comparison was made after the calculated areas defined by such curves. An arbitrary value (mean score) was chosen in each case for J Test evaluation, and significant values were chosen when p less than 0.05. Results: In no case differences were found between the predictive differentiation in survivors and non-survivors by means of R0C eurves~ neither at the admission 9 nor 24 hours later. Conclusion: There is not any predictive advantage in evaluating severity of illness at the admission of the patient in the ICU, instead of 24 hours later, as it has been done up to now, The probability of death increased from 0 to 100%, with increments of SAPS, but the best accuracy (correct classification) was 0.8 at a SAPS of 17. Sensitivity and specificity were less than 0.72 at the best cutoff point (SAPS=13) Thereafter, the 2844 patients were classified in three groups, based on their ICU stay: group I, 0 to 2 days; group II, 3 to 5 days and group III, more than 5 days of ICU stay. In them the ROC curve was plotted. A progressive flattening of the curve, aproaching to the equality line (random), was observed as the ICU stay increased (figure). The areas under the curves (group I=0. 83; group 11=0,74; group 111=0.67) were statistically diferent (p<O.Ol).",

MATERIALS/METHODS: Determination of FRC during general anaesthesia with nitrous oxide (N20) and halothane (HAL) was difficult up to now. This was due to the cross-sensitivity of the standard helium analyser to N20 and HAL. To use the inert SF 6 instead of helium as tracer gas in a closed circuit technique, a rapidly reacting infraredanalyser was developed by Siemens Elema, Co. This analyser ist not bound to the patient and can be used independently of a ventilator. We used this new method on a self developed testlung. A total of 10 test-series were carried out, by which a known FRC between 500 and 2000 ml was determined 10 times at each change in FRC. RESULTS: I. The SF6-analyser shows no cross-senfor N20 and HAL. 2. Using the above method, reproducible results were+obtained, showing a deviation of less than -4% from the actual value. CONCLUSION: The results derived from the test lung lead us to believe, that it should be possible to accurately determine changes in the FRC during and after nitrous oxide/halothane anaesthesia. Static compliance is a valuable parameter for assessing lung pathology and customizing ventilator therapy.",

The purpose of this study was to determine if this monitor could be used to evaluate \"depth of sedation\" in paralysed and ventilated patients on the intensive care unit. Methods : 10 consecutive head injured patients were ~; all were paralysed and ventilated and sedation (morphine + midazolam) was given as indicated on clinical grounds (increase in blood pressure or heart rate, sweating or tear formation). LEC was monitored with an oesophageal probe connected via a pressure transducer to a ANTEC Lectron 301 monitor, and SA and PA recorded. The LEC was monitored continuously the first 8 hrs after admission and then for one hour periods twice a day up to 48 hrs. Results : Only 5 of the 10 patients required sedation. In t-~-6--se~ated patients there was a significant correlation between the amount of sedative drugs given and SA (r = -0.71, p <0.001), whereas PA did not change significantly. In the S unsedated patients, one had continuous SA and made an uneventful recovery; brain death was clfnically diagnosed in the remaining 4 patients in whom no SA was observed, while PA remained present. Conclusions : SA correlates well with the level of sedation and the prolonged absence of SA in unsedated patients suggests brain death. In contrast to anaesthesia, sedation did not influence PA. We feel that LEC is a useful and easy technique to monitor central nervous system activity in paralysed patients in the ITU.

We have examined the following questions: I. How reliable are the values obtained by automatic devices compared to auscultatory procedures or direct blood-pressure measurement in ICU patients? 2. Are there any differences between the devices? 3. What influence does the cardiac index (CI) exert on the results of indirect measurement procedures? In 59 adult ICU patients, values of both the direct and auscultatory method as well as of the devices to be tested were registered concomitantly. Results: There is hardly any difference in the systolic va~ obtained by DINAMAP and ACCUTOR (psyst D: r=0.775; A:r=O.791). ACCUTOR is slightly better for the mean pressure but markedly worse than DINAMAP for pdiast. (pmean A: r=O.757;D:r=O. O77;pdiast A:r=O.563;D:r=O.704) . BOSO yields the best correlations for p syst. and p mean (psyst B: r= 0.842;pmean B:r=O.884;pdiast B: r=0.684) but poor ones for p diast. There is a relation between CI (blood flow) and the systolic values measured by auscultation (mean value from 15 measurements n=56; a=23mmHg; b=-3. 13; r=0 .375 sig, p<O.05): high cardiac indices lead to high auscultatory values of systolic blood pressure and vice versa. Conclusion: Though indirect blood-pressure measurement devices yield plausible values at each measurement, the values differ unforeseeably in both direction and extent from directly measured arterial blood pressure in ICU patients. Thus these devices cannot serve as a replacement for direct blood-pressure measurement.",

In each group the 2 therapeutic subgroups did not differ at randomization in age, sex, previous medical history, carboxyhemoglobin level or length of exposure to carbon monoxide. 41 patients were comatous, 22 in Group BI, 19 in Group B 2. At 1 month follow-up, percentage of recovery, defined as the absence of any signor symptom, is 61% in Group AI, 62 ~ in Group A 2. (lO were lost to follow-up in Group A1, 14 in Group A2). Percentage of reeo~ very is 55, 8 ~ in Group Bl, 44, 6 % in Group B 2 (N.S) , i0 were lost to follow-up in Group B1, 15 in Group B2, 2 died (i in each sub-group), 4 had severe neurs-psychiatric sequelae (i in Group BI, 5 in Group B2). Conclusions : In each therapeutic arm, there is no evidenoe of s positive effect of a strategy over the other. The study must be pursued until 600 patients are included ss initially projected. To assess the effects of diazepam in chloroquine poisoning an experimental study was performed in piglets. 14 animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital and mechanically ventilated. Catheters were advanced into the femoral artery for recording systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressure, into the femoral vein for drugs infusion, and into the external jugular vein and into the bladder for sampling. ECG was monitored continuously. The piglets were treated with 50 mg.kg-1 ehloroquine given intravenously during 25 min. 7 animals were controls (group C) and 7 were treated with dim zepam given intravenously. 5 min after the end of chloroquine infusion (group D). Diazepam was given as following : 2 mg.kg -I during 2 min. ~hen 2 mg.kg-l.h -I during 25 minutes. All the animals were sacrificated after 1 hour. No statistical difference between the 2 groups was assessed for weight, SAP, DAP, heart rate (HR), T wave or QRS duration before diazepam administration. After diazepam the two groups were different ; in group D the SAP (p < 0.01), the DAP (p < 0.05) and the HR (p < 0.01) were higher, the urine flow increased (p < 0.01) the urinary excretion of ehlorequine (p < 0.01) and the chleroquine clearance (p < 0.05) increased. The T wave was abnormal in 1 from group D and 7 from group C (p 0.01). However no differences could be assess for QRS duration probably because group C improved spontaneously too quickly its QRS duration as no more chloroquine was infused. Conclusion : diazepam has important benefic effects in ehloroquine poisoning. Acute methanol intoxication is s serious medical problem due to its mortality and its neurologic sequelae. Its toxicity is tied to its metsbolites : formic acid and formaldehyde, The analysis of 5 recent observations of serious poisonings [pH 7,1B +-O, lg, anion gap2g +_g mmol/I, Knauss'severity index : 11 to 20) points out the following : 1] the diagnostic advantage of the cerebral scanner, showing a decreased density of the putamen, s relatively early sign. g] s macrocytosis, found in all the cases, is an indirect sign of fslic acid deficiency (in 3 cases).

Donner; Vergiftungsinformationszentrale, 1090 Wien During the last years drug treatment of death cap fungus poisoning with silibinin proved to be the most promising therapeutic principle causing a significant reduction of the formerly high mortality. In order to avoid unnecessary and possibly harmful polytherapy, the Austrian Poison Information Centre (Pie) has been recommending monotherapy of death cap poisoning with silibinin during the last years. By analyzing the case records collected in summer and autumn 1985 the efficacy of this regimen was examined. A total of 18 cases had been treated solely with silibinin infusions, except for one patient who underwent haemodialysis. There were 15 adults and 3 children, one 6 and two 14 years of age. 11 of the, patients showed severe liver injury with tran~ aminase values up to 7000 U/l, 4 developed a moderate intoxication with maximum transaminase elevations of 2000 U/I and 3 only light signs of toxic liver injury. In all instances gastrointestinal toxin elimination was attempted. 16 patients survived and one with only moderate liver changes died from acute uncontrollable cardiorespiratory insufficiency following aspiration of gastric contents. A second fatality was due to the ingestion of large amounts of deathcap fungi with resulting fulminant hepatic failure. Adding another 8 cases from former years, a total of 24 cases of poisoning from death cap fungus have been treated successfully by silibinin infusions without the usual combination therapy consisting of penicillin and/or thioctic acid in addition to silibinin. This result suggests that the addition of other drugs than silibinin for the treatment of amanita poisoning bears no detectable advantage. there is a lack of information on blood elimination kinetics under normal minute volume after oral intake of chlorinated hydrocarbons.",

Transverse sections of lung tissue were studied in patients by CT during anaesthesia and in the postoperative period. Eight patients were studied during intravenous (thiopentone) and 6 during inhalational (halothane) anaesthesia. The latter patients were studied both during spontaneous and mechanical ventilation. Five of the patients who underwent surgery for inguinal hernia and five patients in whom lapartomy was performed were studied 1 h and 24 h postoperatively. Results. No patient showed any lung changes while awake preoperatively, and all patients developed dependent, crest-shaped lung densities within 5-10 min of anaesthesia The densities comprised 3.4% of the lung volume in the caudal (basal) 5 cm of the lung tissue. No significant differences in the size and distribution of the densities were noted between spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation during anaesthesia, or between intravenous and inhalational anaesthesia. The densities remained in 9 of 10 patients i h postoperatively, and they remained in 5 of 10 patients 24 h after anaesthesia. Conclusion.

Treatment of severe acute respiratory failure by extracorporeal CO 2 removal (ECCO2-R) with a membrane lung using a PVVB and apneic oxygenation may improve survival rate compared to conventional ventilatory therapy. Since pulmonary endothelial injury can foll~ cardiopulmonary bypass, we designed this study to detect if PVVB affects PEF assessed by the measurements of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) pulmonary extraction and of serum angiotensin converting enzyme (SACE). Method : 7 anesthetized dogs, mechanically ventilated were ~ted to ECCO2-R for 9 hours. Extracorporeal blood flow was set at 0.5 I/min and anticoagulation achieved with heparin. After baseline measurements of 5-HT extraction, SACE, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), arterial oxygen tension (Pa02) , PVVB was instituted and whole sets of measurements were repeated at three hourly intervals, Results are summarized in the table (mean + SE). B-HT extraction, SACE, PAP and PaD 2 did not show any significant difference assessed by analysis of variance for repeated measurements throughout the 9 hours PVVB period. In conclusion, our data suggest that PVVB alone as used in clinical ECCO2-R does not impair PEF. However, 5-HT extraction and SACE level may reflect only a part of the metabolic function of the lung.",

So these data provide support for protease anti-protease system imbalance. The increased concentration of FN could be related to release in structural proteins due to acute endothelial damage. In unilateral lung disease, the lateral position is advocated to improve gas exchange by increasing blood flow to the healty lung. Since densities in postero-basal parts of the lungs can constantly be observed at CT-scans of severe ARDS patients in OPPV, we explored gas exchange and hemodynamics changes of 6 CPPV-ARDS patients turned from supine to prone position. Results are presented in the In 2 cases CT-sean was performed in supine position and 15 min later in prone position showing a nearly complete disappearance of the posterior densities in prone position. In 3/6 cases prone position was accompanied by a transitory increase in bronchial secretions. In no eases circulatory or technical problems were observed. Improved and mope homogeneous ventilation distribution rather than simple blood flow redistribution and/or postural drainage of secretions, may account for significant better gas-exchange which was substantial in all patients. The improvement was immediate and progressive during prone period and maintained when returning to supine position. This observation suggests a therapeutic role for periods of prone position in the ARDS treatment. Classification is necessary when comparing and judging the results of the treatment of patients with peritonitis. Staging of peritonitis was developed according to interoperative findings. The spreading and age of peritonitis has been considered when contemplating further operative management. Also considered has been whether the peritonitis is localised or generalised, and concerning the age, whether non reflecting serosa, easily removable or not easily removable, fibrin coating is present. 22 patients with localised peritonitis in an advanced stage received a closed peritoneal lavage. 31 patients with generalised peritonitis received continual open dorsoventral peritoneal lavage. In order to judge the general clinical picture, a grading of severity, using a point scheme, was developed. Hereby were as well as the stage of the peritonitis the following clinical changes measured, raised temperature, leucocytose, Horowitz-quotient, positive liquid balances, catecholamin requirements and creatinin clearance. Three levels of severity resulted from this, groups A, B and C. In group A 86% from 22 patients survived, in group B 64% from 14 patients and in group C 12% from 17 patients. Our scheme of classification, taking into consideration the staging of peritonitis permits the planning of operative management for individual patients. The levels of severity make it possible to assign the individual patient to particular groups of severity. This procedure make it possible to classify the complex illness peritonitis and to succeed in moving from subjective impression to objective judgement. Indication for surgical treatment of suspected septic foci in critically ill patients is difficult, because clinical signs (\"physical\" indication) are frequently not reliable.",

            "text": "Delayed therapy may result in higher mortality rates. Therefore parameters of septic exacerbation (\"functional\" indication) have to be taken into consideration too. In 200 consecutive patients with peritonitis, parameters of organ function (lung: duration of artificial ventilation, AaD02; kidney: creatinine and free water clearances; circulation: inotropic support, fluid balance; liver: enzymes, clotting pattern) were evaluated at least daily. During In 96.2% relaparotomy was obviously well timed, because organ functions improved or returned to normal. No septic focus could be detected in 2.1%. In 1.7% of relaparotomies no surgical improvement could be obtained. 94 patients (47%) survived. All of 106 (53%) non-survivors proved at post mortem examination ongoing septic processes despite surgical and intensive care treatment. In conclusion, organ function was a valuable guide for surgical intervention in 75% nf these patients. After a controlled clinical trial of 24 patients using the primary closed peritoneal dialysis against primary laparotomy we decided to treat the patients conservatively. With the multimodal conservative therapy concept: Within last 2 years we treated 18 patients with acute pancreatitis,in all of them diagnosis was confirmed during surgery. Patients status was determined according to Ranson/2/,and an average value in the whole group was 5.2 pts.5 patients who survived had an average 3.4 pts.and 13~patients who died 5.8 pts.At this same time function of the lungs,circulation,kidneys,liver, Gl tract and CNS was evaluated according to system presented by Borzotta and Polk/l/. It has been found that all patients who died h~d renal failure-creatinine concentration over 3mg%,and hourly duresis below 20 ml/h-respiratory insufficiency-h~vpoxia PaO~ interstitial pulmonary oedema and CVP ove~ 15cm of H O. In these patients intensive treatment w~s started very late after 36-48 hours since first symotoms of acute pencreatitis appeared. These patients were treated with respirators at least for 6 days without good results.ln survivors controlled respiration w~s used an average only 19 hours. The treatment of these patients started immedietely,2-3 hours after first symptoms of illness,with respirator,large volumes of plasma and albumines and simultaneous use of furosemide to force duresis.ln our opinion an early treatment with controlled respiration,large volumes of protein and forced duresis increases survival rate of patients with acute pancraatitis. Increasing reports support the observation that pulmonary infections do occur more often in ICU-patients when the gastric pH is above 3.5 This is the aim of the conventional stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2-antagonists or antacids (A), Sucralfate (S), a locally active antiulcer drug which also prevents ulcer relapse, does not increase gastric pH above 3.5. S. has also proven its efficiacy for stress bleeding prophylaxis, but until now no study has investigated the prophylactic effect of S. in high risk ICU-patients. METHODS: 60 surgical patients who were ventilated on admission to the ICU received either antacids (75 reval neutralizing capacity)2-hourly or 1 g sueralfate 4-hourly. All patients were treated for at least 2 days. Gastric pH was monitored 8-hourly. Macroseopieally visible bleeding was used as criterion for acute stress bleeding. RESULTS: 30 patients were included in each group until now. The mean treatment time was 5,5 d and the mean time of artificial ventilation was 4,9_+3,0 d without significant differences within the groups. The outcome was fatal in more than 30 % of the patients. Significantly more patients in the S.-group showed gastric pH-values below 4. Stress bleeding ocurred in 1 patient in the antacid group. Exluding patients with thoracic trauma pulmonary infections did occur in 2 S.-treated pat. and in 5 patients in the antacid group. CONCLUSION: Sucralfate proved to be an effective drug for the prevention of acute stress bleeding in high-risk ICU-patients The significantly lower gastric pH in S.-treated patients may decrease the risk of pulmonary infections in ventilated highrisk ICU-patients. The aim of this study was to test the hypothetic superiority of HFJV in term of less interference with a failing haemodynamics. At this purpose, 6 patients with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction followed by cardiogenic shock were investigated. The entry criteria were: CI < 2 l.min-lm -2, PwP > 17 mmHg, PaO 2 ~ 50 mmHg, when spontaneously breathing at a Fi02 D,5. All patients were ventilated with both CMV and HFJV in a randomized sequence. The ventilatory settings were modulated to obtain Pa02 and PaCO 2 values within normal limits.

According to multidisciplinary intensive care organization 6062 patients with critical brain damage were treated in Neuro-Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Tartu Clinical Hospital in 1958 -1985 Patients suffered from brain and spinal injuries -2101 (36.4%), brain tumours-1097 (18.1%), acute poisoniugs-367 (6.1%), vascular diseases of the brain-1094 (18%), meningitis and encephalitis-343 (5.7%), polyneuropathies-96 (1.6%), etc. The average duration of treatment in NICU was 9 days. The main tasks in the treatment were respiratory care, maintenance of adequate circulation and organ support. Intubation was applied in 2192 cases (36.2%), tracheostomy in 1392(25%) and long term artificial ventilation in 2224 (36.7%). Coma scales, computerized tomography (CT), blood gases, acid-base, water-electrolyte, osmotic and haemostatic balances and serum proteins were regularly monitored and evaluated for prognostic purposes. Lethal outcome and poor quality of life were connected with more severe brain damage on CT and resultant deep coma, persistent hypersmolarity and hypernatremia, severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, mainly with long-term hypocoagulation and increased fibrinolytic activity which prevailed in cerebral venous blood samples as compared to arterial ones. Nultiorgan damage and infection, bleeding disorders and greater mortality were found in cases with DIC as compared to the others. Our data show that the main prognostic factors for patients with critical brain damage are severe brain damage on CT, hemostatic breakdown in local cerebral circulation and severe osmoregulation disturbances.

Germany 200 patients of our surgical intensive care unit were examlnated in a prospective study to explore disturbances in consciousness andmenta! state postoperatively or during critical illness. Preoperatively EEGandneurologica! examination were made zn all patients or in case of conservative treatment after having entered the intensive care unit. Further investigations were made after the onset of disturbances of consciousness and of all patients before leaving the intensive care unit. In addition all important laboratory tests and a physical examination were registrated in short zntervals. 38 of the 200 examinated patients (19%) deve]o~d a temporary mental failure. In 24 (64%) of those patients we observed a separate organic cause beside the basic illness, the main causes were organ failure, toxicaemia, hypoxaemia and septicaemia. Only in 6 of these 24 patients (25%) the entrance -EEG was suspicious. Within the remaining group of 14 patients (37% of all) without detectable organic failures preexisting alterations of the EEG were evident in a high rate (11 = 78,5%). The disturbance in menta! state induced by organic complicatlons seams to be a first sign as diagnostic parameter. FROM 1982 FROM -1984 States of confusion and drowsiness can influence duration and outcome of postoperative intensive care in elderly patients. EEG-recordings can document cerebral dysfunction and may detect acute changes in cerebral function during intensive care.

On the first day after general anesthesia, 70Z had an irregular EEG with generalized slowing, especially within the Alpha-range. 57,8% of all patients were disorientated on admission, 16 showed confusion in the following period. All these disorientated patients developped a disorganization of the background-activity, slowing of the dominant frequency within the Alpha-range of 2 Hz and a peak within the Theta-range at 5 Hz. On the 3rd day, there was faster activity within the Alpha-range and a diminution of slower frequencies within the Theta-range when the patien~ were clear-minded. The EEG is an efficient indicator of cerebral function in patients on an ICU. States of confusion can be predicted, further dominance of slow frequencies can be seen in patients with cardiac or septic complications, grouped dysrhythmias oecure in metabolic disorders. The choice of fluid therapy for optimizing plasma volume in septic shock remains controversial. We investigated the impact of the colloid osmoticwedge pressure gradient (COP-PCWP; as an estimate of the intravascular Starling forces) on extravascular lung water (EVLW) volume. The study design involved fluid replacement with both saline and human albumin solutions (accepted minimum COP: 16 mmHg). Sequential measurements (n=164) of thermal-dye EVLW, COP, and PCWP were performed in 18 patients with severe sepsis. PCWP was within the normal range (9.9 ~3.8 mmHg, mean \u00b1SD); COP (19.6 \u00b12.6 mmHg) and COP-PCWP (9.8 \u00b14.3 mmHg) were well maintained. There was no correlation between EVLW (12.9 \u00b16.2 ml/kg) and PCWP as well as COP-PCWP (p >O.l, Spearman test); however, a positive correlation could be established between EVLW and COP (p <O.Ol). These findings show lacking relevance of COP-PCWP in non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This gradient is obviously no determinant of EVLW formation in septic states. In accordance with experimental data, colloids might adversely affect transvascular fluid flux and thus enhance fluid overload of the pulmonary interstitium. In conclusion, there is no rationale for maintaining a positive COP-PCWP as therapeutic endpoint for fluid resuscitation if elevated EVLW is caused primarily by a permeability defect of the pulmonary microvasculature. *) Sup@o~ ~ the ~ni~ ~ Health andE~ironmental Protection.",

We studied 23 consecutive MV-pts (15 male, 8 female; 20 -79 years) in ICU with TEE using a 3.5 MHz (Diasonics) or 5 MHz (Hewlett Packard) phased array transducer at the tip of a flexible gastroscope. No complication occurred in any patient. In all cases image quality was diagnostic but was of higher quality using the 5 MHz probe. 7 pts had no signs of functional or morphologic cardiac disorders. In 16 of 23 septic pts TEE revealed global left ventricular (LV) abnormalities, in 7/16 pts global LV hypokinesia and in 9/16 pts hyperkinetic wall motion (WM). 5 septic pts with hyperkinetic WM were misdiagnosed (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure > 15 mmHg) as having LV failure. TEE findings had therapeutic consequences in 10 cases. Therapeutic results were continuously monitored by TEE up to 3 hours, Pericardial effusion not suspected by clinical means was detected in 4 pts, concentric LV hypertrophy in 3 pts, segmental WM abnormalities in 2 pts and LV aneurysm in 1 of the 23 pts. In another septic pt with hemiplegia TEE revealed vegetations on anterior mitral leaflet. It is concluded that T E E is a complementary diagnostic and save technique for the study of mechanically ventilated surgical ICU pts, It provides valuable functional and morphologic information on cardiac disorders during septic shock and enables the noninvasive monitoring of the responses to treatment. In plasma from 42 septic patients who underwent surgery for diffuse fibrinopurulent peritonitis the endotoxin concentration was determined till the patients' conditions improved or until they died. The endotoxin determination was performed with a modification of the Limulus-Test, using the chromogenic substrate. In almost all cases we could observe a rise of the endotoxin level in the postoperative phase. In patients who survived without further surgical intervention the endotoxin level decreased continually below the detection limit (0.02 EU/ml). All patients whose endotoxin level had continuously increased after surgical intervention and exceeded the concentration of 0.4 EU/ml died of multiple organ failure. A good correlation was found between the endotoxin concentration and the parameters of inflamation (leucocytes: r = 0.92). A good correlation between the postoperative level of endotoxin concentration and the parameters of the development of a shock lung (r = 0.79) as well as failure of the kidneys (r = 0.89) and liver (r = 0.93) could also be observed. Endotoxin determination may become a significant diagnostic aid in peritonitis if it is performed regularly and enables us to monitor and forecast the courses and the outcome of severe cases of peritonitis. ~om 1981 to 1985 in 16 consecutive patients suffering from a comatose form of pne~mDcoccal meningitis (mean age 40 + 7 years, glascow coma score from 3 to 6) intracran [al pressures (ICP) were monitorized with an extradural sensor (EDS) settled in mean 1,2 Z 1,3 day after the onset of coma. The aims were to detect ICH and to improve its therapy. In every case basal therapy associated : pentobarbital at a dose of 30 mg/kg BW/day given IV continuously), normohydration, controlled hypervehtilation, normotherm/a, and 30 \u00b0 head up-tilt. According to the level of ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) defined as mean arterial pressure minus mean ICP additionnal therapy~re given. If ICP> 15 ~ Hg, a IV bolus of pentobarbital at a dose of 5 mg/kg/BW ~s done, in ease of failing a dose of mannitol (20 g) completed the therapy. This procedure could be repeated 10 times a day. Once a day barbiturate blood level and osmolality were measured in order to not exceed 100 mcmol/l and 320 mesmol/l respectively. If CPP~ 50 ~nHg dopamine was used. The results show that a) all the patients developped ICH during in average 27 % of the duration of ICP monitoring ; b) 2 patients with Iow CPP could not receive optimal barbiturate treatment (2 deaths) ; c) I patient kept IC}{despitemaximal therapy (I death) ; d) among the 13 remaining patients several acute ICHwere regressive with therapy (3 deaths) ; e) no EDS complication ; f) the long time follow up of 9 recovered patients show anabsence of sequellae in 8 and a seizure in 1 (one crisis per year). Compared to the usual percentage of mortality and sequels in a such kind of patients these results may suggest the usefulness of that therapeutic strategy. The development of a severe edema can be a limiting factor in the therapy of stroke, intracerebral hematoma (ICH) and subarachnold hemorrhage (SAH). We used the gaeltec transducer to measure epidural pressure and to quantify the therapeutic antiedemic effects of glycerol and sorbitol. IntracraniaI pressure (ICP), systemic arterial pressure (SAP) and cranial perfuston pressure (CPP) were continously monitored by the computer supported calculator of \"Dr. Weiss Neuromonitor\", which presents histograms and statistical values such as frequency distribution of mean pressure values and pulse amplitudes. The cerebral edema increased to high values 3-6 days after the ICH. After 6-8 days the ICP reached values of 35-45 mmHg or without therapy even higher. This period of high ICP lasted 2-5 days. The ICP was reduced by an oral bolus of 50% glycerol (50 g) or alternatively by an intravenous infusion of 40% sorbitol (50 g).Within 40 min the ICP was reduced by glycerol from a value of 35-45mm Hg to 13 mmHg, by sorbitol within 30 min to 16 mm Hg. Glycero] reduced the ICP for 3 h and sorbitol on]y for 1 I/2 h . The time course of the ICP reducing effect followed exactly the time course of the changes in osmolalzty due to the administration of glycerol or sorbitol. Hyperosmolar therapy could be reduced 8-12 days after ICH, when ICP decreased to less than 20 mmHg. During the period of low ICP, glycerol reduced ICP for a period of 8h and sorbitol For 4 h. Epidural pressure monztorzng allowed an exact control of ICP and of antiedemlc therapy. The dosage of glycerol and sorbitol had to be adjusted to the degree of ICP. During some days very high dosages were necessary. G]ycerol and sorbitol were alternatively used to diminish accumulation in the brain. Hyperosmolarity and hyperglycemia of the plasma were 11mzting factors which demanded an adequat drug monitoring. This therapy was supported by the good clinical outcome of the patients. ICP monitoring in severe head injury has been shown to be a major factor oontribuim~ to a Better outaome. Little is known about prognosis factors, that determine outcome after cardiopulmonary rescutitation; ICP monitoring has been proposed but has not been yet evaluated. We studied+prospectively 10 patients (9 men, 1 woman, age 60,8 -17,2 years) with anoxic cerebral insult (9 cardiocirculatory arrest, 1 hanging). They were all deeply comatose (Glasgow Coma Score 7) 48 h after admission. ICP was meseared by an epidural screw and mean arterial pressure (M/P) with an arterial catheter. The cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was approximated by the difference Between M~P and ICP. ICP monitoring was Began in 7 cases the first day of admission and in 3 cases the second day. The patients were monitored during 10.6 ~ 8.7 days. To maintain ICP below 15 tort we used bypervent$1ation (PC02 : 3-9 ~ 0.4 KPa), hypothermia ( + : 36\"9 ~ 0:4 \u00b0) fluid restriction (loss of weight 0.~ -0.1 g/kg/J)$ muscle paralysis with paucuroni~, ~.n\u00b1toi (0.15 -0.1 ~/kg/~), furomanias (150 ~ 110 mg/j) and Thiopental (6.5 -1.5 mg/ kg/J). In two oases a catheter was inserted into a lateral ventr~cule to obtain a drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (210 -50 ml/~) during 4 -2 days.",

U.Dirnagl, C.Garner K.Einh~u~l, G.Schmieder, Dept. of Neurology, Unzversity of ~unieh, B M~[nchen 70, FRG Continuous measurement of the intracranial pressure (ICP) reveals in ~san~ patients an oscillating ICP with s frequency of 0.5-2/mln and often high amplitudes. Etiology and =linical significance have been controversially discussed ever sznce LUNDBERG termed this phenomenon B-waves. They have been considered as without any significance resp. as an indicator for a good as well as for a bad prognosis, Bwaves were interpreted as either originatlng from the brain-stem or as a result of periodic breathing resp. as a myogenic phenomenon. It was the aim of our study to determine the etiolog~ and clinical significance of B-waves in the patlents o~ our intensive care unit. 30 consecutive patients with primary intracranial diseases were monitored for intraventricular ICP, blood pressure, central venous pressure, heart rate, \u00a2utaneons ezrculation, digital plethysmogram, impedance plethysmogram and art. blood gases for at least 24 hours. In each patient intracranial compliance was determined by bolus manlpulation. Spectral analysis and cross correlation ~f the data were evaluated on a mzcroeomputer. 12 patients were artificially ventilated, 18 breathed spon-~aneouslv, 8 of the latter showed Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR). 27 patients had B-waves with an amplitude >3mmHg (maximum 55mmHg) from 3% up to 70% of the time recorded. A simultaneous oscillation was detectable in all cardiorespiratory parameters concomitant B-waves, no matter whether the patient was respired or not, except that respired patients and those without CSR showe~ no blood gas oscillations. There was no correlation of the duration and amplitudes to dia=nosis or outcome, but the correlation of B-wave amplitudes to intracranial compliance was statistically significant. From the data presented we infer that there are two types of B-waves: 1) B-waves as a result of oscillating ~02 during CSR. The clinical significance of this type would be the same ss of CSR itself.",

Since a rhythm of the vegetative nervous system within the same frequency range can be observed in normal subjects, esp. during sleep, it is our conclusion that this type of B-waves, when present with high amplitudes and over long neriods of time, only signifies pathological intracranial compliance and/or depressed consciousness. Therefore B~aves are an important clinical feature in the measurement of ICP, because they can be harmful to the brain via impairment of the cerebral perfusion pressure and indicate exhausted volume compensation capacity. Tizanidine is a centrally acting agent. The pharmacological profile provides evidence that it differs from other myotonolytie drugs in current use. In patients it has strong muscle relaxant properties at doses giving no appreciable sedation. Twelve patients with generalized tetanus (i0 females) aged between 40 and 82 years (mean age 58.8 \u00b116.3) were t~eated with tizanidine. There was i mild, 2 moderate (tracheostomy) and 9 severe tetanus (tracheostomy (tracheos tomy+artificial ventilation). Penicillin, human intratheca~ A.T.S. and heparin in continuous infusion were the standard management. Tizadine diluted in 5% glucose was administrated by continuous pwmpe infusion in different doses depending on the needs of the patients. The highest dose was 31.1mg/ day. Besides in one patient 0.5mg were injected two times directly. In other two patients pancuroniumbromide was added in small doses intravenously (maximum 12mg/day) to overcome violent spasms. One patient received analgesics because he complained of hard pains. The mean time of therapy with tizanidine was 15.2\u00b15.2 days. The mean time of artificial ventilation (n=9) was 16,9\u00b17,6. The mean time of stay in I.C.U. was 23,4\u00b19,5. In spite of the age of the patients a good myorelaxant effect was obtained allowing correct oxygenation, without worrisome cardiovascular disturbances. No complications, namely sympathetic overactivity were found. The patients were conscious throughout the treatment which is an advantage to follow the evolution of the disease and avoid wverdosage of sedation. The patients would collaborate even to cough. No adverse effects were present in these dosages. We accomplished pharmacwkinetic study of tizanidine administrated in such conditions. All patients fully recovered. We think this drug has a place in the treatment of tetanus and must be studied in a multicentric trial Nine patients, 6 females, 3 males, age 40 to 81, with global MG were treated with Ci. Follow-up is 5 to 14 months. Length of MG at inztiation of Ci was i to i0 years. Previous treatments include : prednisone 3~ azathioprln l, thymomectomy 3. Functional status was divided in 5 grades = i. Complete remission ; 2. minor symptoms i 3. moderate symptoms ; 4. all activity discontinued ; 5. mechanical ventilation. Prior to Ci 5 patients were in grade 5, 4 in grade A. Serum ab. AChR was positive in 6, negative in 3. Method : 4 to 8 mg/kg/day (adapted to whole-blood levels) of Ci were given orally in 2 or 3 times on an ampty stomach. Whole blood Ci was measured every fortnight for 2 months then monthly. The sougth Ci level before each dose is i00 to 200 ng/ml. Renal and hepatic Functions, blood pressure (BP) were monitored monthly. Results : from grade 5, 2 patients passed to grade 2, 2 to grade 3 and 1 to grade 4. From grade 4, 3 passed to grade 2 and i to grade 3. No decrease in ab AChR or significant alteration in T4 levels were observed. 8 patients have hypertriehosis~ 5 a rise in 8P, 5 increased ereatinin levels. Ci was reduced in 5. Conclusion : Ci showed a beneficial effect in our patients. It may be an interesting alternative to other immunosuppressors. Its handling is difficult. Fibronectin (Fn) can be regarded as an indicator of reticule-endothelial status. We have confirmed that Fn levels are higher in an elderly population, fall mn sepsis and fall transiently following surgery. In a controlled study of Fn replacement therapy 22 patients meeting our criteria for bhe diagnosis of septic shock were randomised to either Group A(n=ll) who received routine intensive cape therapy; or Group B(n=ll) who in addition received plasma cryopreeipitate infusions in doses calculated Lo maintain a normal plasma Fn level. Initial Fn levels were unifoPntly low (i13~47 : Mean~SD) and in control patients (Group A) consistently low or steadily falling levels were associated with a fatal outcome. In Group B patients cryoprecipi~ate infusion elevated plasma Fn by an average of 135mg. l -pep pool of i0 units infused. Cryoprecipitate infusion was associated with improvement in a variety of variables (Table [) (16) p<0.05",

Endothelium cells are known to-be a major source of PGI 9. Some authors suggested a contribution of the-Hageman factor (F XII) or the complement system to ET effects on the vessel wall. We investigated the PGI 2 production of rabbit aortas in an in vitro system. Small pieces of the vessel wall were punched out and incubated in different media with and without ET. PGI 2 was determined as 6-oxo-PGF1~ by RIA. Incubating aortic pieces in phosphate buffer(PB) over time periods up to 50 minutes, we found a lowering of PGI 2 formation by increasing time from 560 pg/10 min to 125 pg/10 min . This exhaustion also occured incubating vessel walls in serum (S), heparinized plasma (HP) or citrated plasma (CP). Addition of ET (I;10;100 ~g/ml) to PB significantly augmented PGI~ liberation from 316 pg/ml to 522, 560, 649 p~/ml, respectively. On the other hand, ET had no stimulating effect when incubations were performed in S, HP or CP. Neither activation of the complement system nor decomplementation of HP and CP nor a deficiency of F XII in CP affected the PGI 2 synthesis of aortic vessel walls. We conclude that in this in vitro system ET directly stimulates PGI 2 production of vessel wall cells. This effect is inhibited by unknown serum or plasma complements.",

Interference by the P#F-acether antagonist BN 52021 with the cardiovascular shock induced by S. typhimurium endetoxin (Difco, 0.3 mg/kg) was investigated on anaesthesized guinea-pigs. A biphasic change in ~ean arterial pressure was elicited after the endetoxin administration. Control animals showed a rapid drop in blood pressure (maximal within 10 rain), a partial recovery at 20 min and a second more gradual decrease after 30 min. Treaimmnt with BN 52021 injected 10 ,fin prior to endetoxin reduced the initial rapid drop in blood pressure, from 44% in vehicle-treated controls (n = 15) to 27% in animals treated with i mg/kg BN 52021 (n = 10), and to 12% when treated with 6 mg/kg of BN 52021 (n = 6). ~ mare gradual secondary decrease in blood pressure recorded frcm 30 to 90 min was less altered by pretrealment with BN 52021, although a significant reduction was observed, frcm 45% in controls to 21% in treated animals, lhe initial drop in blood pressure appeared conccmitant with a fall of the number of circulating platelets, which was maximal at 10 rain. lhis early thrumbncytopenia was affected by pretrealment with BN 52021, the 82% fall in control animals at 10 min being reduced to 65% (p 0.02) with 1 mg/kg of BN 520@1 and to 60% with 6 nN/kg -(p 0.01). Endotexin-induced leukopenia was also observed, maximal at 10 min but it was net significantly affected by BN 52021. The initial rapid rabbit change in blood pressure was abbregated in animals made thrembopenic with rabbit antiplatelet serum (platelet counts less than 1 0000 per ul). ~ preventive effect of BN 52021 on the initial fall of blood pressure appeared thus related to its effect on blood platelets, however the gradual hypotension elicited by endetoxin in thrombopenic animals was almDst completely prevented by treaim~nt with 1 ~J/kg of BN 52021. Moreover, the intravenous injection of BN 520~1 during the prolonged secondary phase of shock was followed by an immediate correction of the depressed blood pressure, lhis change in blood pressure was dose-dependent. It persisted despite repeated endotoxin administration and was observed whether the animals were thrembopenic or net. Our results indicate that BN 52021 interferes with the cardiovascular effects of endotexin in the guinea-pig. Even though it may be argued that the effectiveness of BN 52021 suggests a role for PAF in endotoxic shock, the pharmacological properties of BN 52021 indicate that other sites of action may be involved. Purpose: We investigated the effects of Felodipine [F] on oxygen transport and utilization variables during the initial phase of endotoxic shock in piglets. Methods: 13 anaesthetized, ventilated piglets of either sex (4-6 kg; 3-4 weeks) were studied. In group I (n=5) E.coli endotoxin [E] (0.15 ug/kg) was administered over one minute. In group II (n=4) animals received F (2 ug/kg/min) during a 30 minutes period after E injektion. In group III (n=4) only F was administered without prior E application. Intermittend measurements of arterial oxygen partial pressure (Pa02), hemoglobin and cardiac output were done at control prior to E or F in 15 -30 minutes intervals for 2 hours. Arterial and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SaO2, Sv02) were measured continuously and were controlled by intermittend sample measurements. Oxygen content (Ca02, Cv02), arterial -mixed venous oxygen content difference (a-vD02), oxygen availability (0e-avail), oxygen extraction ratio (C~-rstio) and oxygen consumption (VO2) were calculated using standard formulas. Results: E resulted in a decrease of Pa02, Cv02 and Oz-avail and in an increase of 02-ratio and a-vD~. VOz did not change. In the group of animals receiving F after the application of E CvO2 and 02-avail increased and consequently a-vDO~ and 02-ratio decreased while Sa02 and VOe remained unchanged. The results in the group of animals just receiving F (group III) were not different from the results in group II (E plus F). Conclusion: The applicaton of E in the animal model chosen resulted in oxygen transport and utilization variables typical for a hypodynamic shock phase. By the additional administration of the calmodulin inhibitor F these variables changed corresponding to the situation in a hyperdynamic shock state. We have shown previously that Eglin C 3.85 mg/kg x h for 4 h prolongs survival and protects lung morphology and function in septic piglets. Eglin C was available by genetical engineering from Ciba-Geigy. We studied 18 weaned pigs (20 kg) in a controlled, randomized protocol. Septicemia w~ induced by infusing a suspension of 3 x 10 ~V live E.coli over 2 h. Simultaneously with the E.coli suspension, 6 animals were give, Eglin C / kg x h for 4h, 6 received 7.7 mg / kg x h and 6 received solvent (NaCI 0.9% 200 ml in 4 h). Surviving animals were sacrificed 24 h or later after start of the infusions. Eglin administration lead to increased survival rates (54.5% vs. 33.3%) and prolonged median survival times (over 24 h vs. 8:12 h). Diuresis was maintained in more animals (45.5% vs. 16.6%) and for a longer median diuretic period (12h vs. 5 h) after induction of sepsis in Eglin treated animals. Eglin showed also beneficial actions in terms of leukopenia, leukocytosis, thombocytopenia, plasma creatinine levels, arterial blood pressure, acid-base balance, and protected plasma inhibitors ATIII, FXIII and ~2-macroglobulin from degradation. It is our impression that Eglin C 1.9 mg/ kg x h given for a long period promises the most benefit. To reduce the mortality from acute renal failure (ARF), we have used continuous high volume venous venous haemofiltration (HF) early in the management of acute uraemia and fluid overload. Of 18 patients with multiple organ failure (Ii males,7 females; mean age 56, range 30-72 years; mean APACHE II scores pre-HF 24.9 ~ 1.9), 17 were treated for ARF (serum creatinine) 400 umol/l and/or oliguria) and one for severe ARDB with fluid overload. 7 (39%) patients were subsequently discharged from the ITU and 6 (33%) from hospital. Using a double lumen catheter in the subclavimn or femoral vein, blood (anticoagulated with heparin 530-1000 units/hr and prostacyclin 5m10 ng/kg/min) w~s pumped at 200 ml/min through an Asahi PAN-50P hollo~ fibre artificial kidney; replacement was with isotonic Sambro haemofiltration fluid and approriate parenteral nutrition.

Five patients were excluded from the study because of early death after surgery. Nine patients required intermittend dialysis or continuous hemofiltratien techniques. Renal dysfunction in the remaining 22 patients was characterized by compensated hypercatabolism lowered glemeruler filtration, reduced ability to concentrate and an elevated fractional excretion of potassium. The causes could be reduceden ischemic insults during cross clamping, nephrotexicity of cyclosporin A, hyperaldesterenism and glueesuria. Patients who needed intermittend dialysis or coninuous hemofiltration in the first week postoperatively suffered from second injuries due to nosocomial sepsis (5) hepatorenal syndrom by dysfunction of the graft (2) or by second ischemic insult due to massiv bleeding after surgery (i) or stenosis of the suprahepatic vena cava.

RESULTS : 1 o) Hemodynamic tolerance was good (no hypotension) in 8 cases, acceptable (easily reversible bypotension) in 5, and poor in one (collapse leading to H-D. interruption at third hour). 2 \u00b0) Acidosis was Fully corrected in a]l cases : end-dialysis values : pH 7.44 \u00b1 0.05, Bicarbonate 18,8 \u00b1 5.3., pC02 3.58 Z 1.08, Mean A pH/hour on Four hours was D.OB \u00b1 D.O4 ; maximum of pH correction occurs in First hour ( A pH 0.22/h). 3 o) Glycemia remained high 22.5 \u00b1 11 mM and kallemia was 3.3~ \u00b1 1 mM ; ,o arrhythmia was noted. CONCLUSION : Severe metabolic acidosis associated with OKA can be complexly corrected in Four hours or less by B-B.H-D. ; potential deleterious effects of bicarbonate sodium are avoided because large amounts of pbyslologlc buffers can be brought by dialysis diffusion without sodium or water loading. One can assume lesser risk of potenblally lethal complications of DKA such as cerebral oedema and pulmonary oedema with ARDS. Clinical tolerance is good and emergency performance is easy. Stay in ICU can be strikingly shortened for the most severe oases of DKA. Subject: Purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of CAVH on substrate homeostasis in hy~ercatabolic ICUpatients receiving total parenteral nutrition. Method: In 15 artificially ventilated and continuously hemofiltrated, hypermetabolic patients receiving I gA amino acids.kg-l.d -I and 6,4 g carbohydrates.kg-l-d -I the concentrations of the substrates delivered, urea and creatinine were determined in plasma, hemofiltrate and urine. Furthermore the fatty acids and the amino acid pattern were conlouted. Results: In patients with acute renal failure and CAVH the excretion of all subs\u00b1rates was directly proportional to the level of the plasma concentrations and to the total amount of the ultrafiltrate. The average filtrationrate necessary to avoid a further increase in plasma urea concentration was about 17 l.d -I . Compared to the glucose losses (about 35 % of the amount delivered) amino acid, xylitol or fructose excretions via hemofiltration were less than 5 %. In contrast to the \"natural\" amino acid pattern in urine there Was a direct relation in the ultrafiltrate to each amino acid concentration in plasma. Conclusion: CAVH in hypermetabolic critically ill patients proves to be an effective method which allows an almost unrestricted fluid and substrate application. Of all substrates studied only glucose Was excreted via hem~filtration in relatively high amounts. CAVH supported the correction of trauma and disease related changes in subs\u00b1rate ~stasis. Literary HCL solutions are used in clinical practice for correction of severe metabolic alkalosis. With help of our clinical measurements it is only possible to evaluate the acid-base status of the extracellular compartment of our patients. It was the purpose of this investigation to determine the effects of HCL-infusion on the acidbase status of the intracellular body compartment. The arterial plasma pH ( pHe ) of nephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats was decreased with infusion of HCL to pHe 7.357, 7.223 or 7.152 and then held constant for two hours. The intracellular pH ( pHi ) of liver, heart, brain and two different skeletal muscle groups was determined from the distribution of 14C labelled . Compared to a control group at pHe 7.411 it was found out that the intracellular pH and the intracellular bicarbonate concentration of the investigated tissues decreased with decreasing pHe to a significant degree. this experimental study shows HCL to be a good zhoice for correction of severe metabolic alkalo-~is because its application leads to s dosedependent decrease of intra-and extracellular pH and bicarbonate concentrations. In health, cerebral blood flow (CBF) is constant in the face of changes in both perfuslon pressure and cardiac output but is closely related to cerebral metabolic demand. We have investigated these relations by measuring CBF (Xenon clearance -Nero Cerebrograph), cerebral 02 delivery (CDa02) (CBF x arterial 02 content) and uptake (CMR 02) (CRF x arterio -Jugular venous bulb 02 content difference), with systemic haemodynamlc variables (mean arterial pressure [MAP] and cardiac index [CI]) in 6 critically Ill patients (5 males, 1 female; median age 54, range 23 -66 years; 4 of the 6 receiving mechanical ventilation, 3 with proven sepsis and 3 following head injury) on 22 separate occasions. 3 or 4 measurements were made in each patient over a period of 4 hours and although on no occasion was the MAP less than 60 mmHg (median 99, range 61 -126 mmHg) or the CI les~ than 2.6 i/mln/m 2, (median 3.8, range 2.6 -7.0 i/mln/m ) there was a wide range of both CBF (median 73, range 20 -142 ml/lOOgm/min) and CMR 02 (median 3.13, range 0.84 -5.76 ml 02/100gm/mln). There was a close eorrelatlon between changes in CDa02 and CMR 02 (r = 0.67, p (0.01) whereas changes in CBF (and hence CDa02) were related to changes in both MAP (r = 0.61, p (0.02) and Cl (r = 0.70, p (0.001). Changes in CMR 02 also correlated closely with changes in MAP (r = 0.57, p (0.05) and CI (r = 0.71, p (0.001) in contrast with the normal physiological relatiions. These results suggest that there is a severe disturbance in cerebral autoregulatlon in the critically Ill so that CMR 02 becomes both flow and pressure dependent. This abnormality in the relation of supply and demand of 02 to the brain may underly the development of encephalopathy in some cases. Intensive Therapy Unit, The Middlesex Hospital, Mortimer Street, London WI. Unreeognised tissue hypoxla may underly the development of multiple organ failure (MOF) in the critically ill following an episode of shock. We have investigated this problem in 15 patients by the measurement of oxygen consumption before and during an infusion of the mlcrocirculatory vasodilator, prostacyelln (PGI2)~ relating changes in oxygen uptake to overall survival. The 15 patients (i0 males, 5 females; median age 58, range 26-79 years; 6 with cardiogenie and ii with sep~icaemlc shock) were admftted for haemodynamic monitoring and all were receiving mechanical ventilation during the study. 8 patients subsequently died with MOt (median time from study to death 120, range 12-1068 hours). Following the establishment of the monitoring (HR,CVP,EAP,PAWP and AP), baseline measurements were made of pressures, cardiac index, arterial and mixed venous P02~ saturation and haemoglobin; 02 delivery (Da02) and consumption (OUI) were calculated. PGI2 was infused at 5ng/kg/mln for 30 minutes and the measurements repeated. Baseline measurements revealed no dffferenees between survivors and nonsurvivors. EGI2 produced a significant (p <0.01) fall in SVR (median % fall 17%) with an increase in cardiac index (median % increase 26%). In all patients, there was an increase in Da02 (medians before and during infusion 375 and 469 ml/mln.m 2, p (0.01) that was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors. However, only 8 of the 15 patients had a significant increase in OUI and 7 of these subsequently died. Nonsurvlvors had a significantly greater % increase in OUI compared with survivors (median % increases 4 and 16% respectively, p (0.01). These results suggest that a tissue oxygen debt may he revealed by an infusion of EGI2. This covert hypoxla appears to be an important contributing mechanism in the devlopment of MOt and subsequent death. Shock is characterized by the extravasatlon of both fluid and plasma proteins.",

Since excessive RV dilatation is susceptible to threaten myocardial oxygen balance and interfere with left ventricular geometry, measurements of RV volumes could be helpful during aggressive fluid therapy. To study the osseciation between duration of mechanical ventilation and onset of pulmonary infections, we anal~ed 724 ventilated patients (mechanically or with other forms of respiratory support delivered through a tracheal tube) out of 1475 patients collected in a multioenter prospective study in 20 ICLIs i~ Italy over the last two ~ears.

The actuarial survival curve on a ~milog scale ( Figure) The appearance of infiltrates on chest roentgenogram and purulent tracheal secretions may herald to onset of a bacterial lung infection (BLI) in ventilated patients. However, similar findings may also be present in uninfected patients. To determine the frequency of BLI in this setting and to identify the most efficient tests for discriminating between infected and non-infected patients, we prospectively evaluated all patients ventilated for at least 3 days who had a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest roentgenogrom and purulent tracheal aspirations. 147 patients (5~13 yrs) were enrolled for a total of 180 episodes. Fibereptic bronchoseopy using a protected specimen brush (PSB) with quantitative cultures was performed immediately to obtain uncontaminated lower airway secretions in the abnormal area. The diagnosis of Btl was made when at least one microorganism was cultured in a concentration of greater than 103 cfu/ml. Infection was identified by PSB (PSB+) in only 56 cases (31%). Follow up evaluation of patients with negative PSB (PSB-) ~uggested that false negative results were unusual. The diagnosis of BLI was definitely excluded in 73 cases because of absence of signs of BLI at autopsy or recovery without antimicrobial therapy. In 15 other patients the diagnosis ef BLI was improbable since they recovered without modification of antibiotic therapy initiated prior to the development of pulmonary infiltrates. In 36 patients antibiotic therapy was later modified because of evidence of non-pulmonary infection. However, none of these patients demonstrated extension ef pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of the presence of undiagnosed BLI. Thus PSB appears to be an accurate technique to identify patients requiring antibiotic therapy fur treatment of new pulmonary infiltrates. In contrast, analysis of 15 different clinical variables were ef little use in distinguishing patients with PSB+ and PSB-. Of the variables evaluated, significant differences were observed for age, number of lymphocytes and Pa02 (FI02 0.60). However, the combination ef these 3 variables in a stepwise discrlminant analysis correctly classified only 73% of patients wlth PSB+ and 56% of patients with PSB-. The appearance of new x-ray infiltrates and purulent tracheal secretions does not result from BLI in a majority of patients. Patients requiring antibiotic therapy can be accurately diagnosed using PSB, but could not be distinguished by a computer model using clinical criteria. This study was conducted on 30 polytraumatized intubated patients with no prior hospitalization and aimed at preventing the aspiration of pathogenic microorganisms from the subglottic region.

Cuvillo Hospital de Jerez, Spain. INTRODUCTION: The most definitive procedures available for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), photoscanning and pulmonary arteriography,are not available today in the most of the medium level hospitals. Even in the well-equipped hospitals they are not feasible always when it is necessary a rapid and reliable diagnostic confirmation because of the critical condition of the patient and/or when thrombolytic or surgical treatment is being considered. The purpose of this study was appraise the diagnostic capabilities of early bedside angiography with videotape recording of the images obtained with radiological intensifier.",

            "text": "CONCLUSIONS: The integration of anatomical information with hemodynamic data has allowed a quick and reliable diagnosis of PE; this may lead to quicker therapeutic decisions. But the greatest advantage is its availability in any ICU, where a large number of patients with acute symptoms susceptible to be PE are sent. We have shown Ketanserin (K), a specific blocker of 5 HT 2 receptors, lowers mean pulmonary arterial pressure (FT~P) and increases arterial 02 tension (PaO 2) during acute PE. To further define the mechanism by which the PaO 2 is increased, we studied 10 spontaneously breathing patients aged 40 to 74 years, during the early phase of PE (I to 10 days). Mean angiographic vascular__obstruction (Miller's index) was 48 \u00b1 19 %. Hemodynamic C PAP, cardiac index (CI), total pulmonary vascular resistance (TPR)] and gas exchange (PaO 2, P~O 2) parameters were recorded ; 02 consumption (VO 2) was calculated as Clxa-V 02 content difference. Distribution of VA/Q ratios was evaluated using the 6 inert ~as elimination technique, and shunt (Qs/Qt), and mean VA/Q ratios (VA/Q m) were derived. Measurements were obtained before and after administration of a I0 mg IV bolus of K followed by a continuous infusion of 20 < 0.01 K significantly reduced the PAP and TPR. There was no significant change of the distribution of VA/Q ratios following K infusion. The increase of PaO 2 was associated with a significant increase in PvO 2 which was unrelated to variations of CI but appeared secondary to a decreased ~02\u00b0 Urapidil (U), a new vasedilator acts by postsynaptic alphal-blockade reducing central sympathetic tone and inhibiting the aortic pressure baroreceptor reflex. U was assessed in ten patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure <25 mni~g) due to COPD (7), interstitial l~g disease (2), primary hypertension (1) and was conqDared with ~dralazine (H). Right heart catheterization was perfomed during a period of clinical stability and arterial pressure monitored. H~mdynemic variables were recorded every 30 rain for 2 hours after drug administration. Each patient received both 0.35 mg/kg Hydralazine end 0.7 ~/kg Urapidil intravenously on two sequential days in a randomized order, lhe effects of each drug at 60 rain were tested by ANOVA and con~red with a paired t test. H decreased systBnic vascular resistance from 25 to 13 u (p < 0.001) and decreased pulmanary vascular resistance (PVR) from 12.5 to 9.5 u (p < 0.001). U had a more prono~ed effect on the PVR (L~creasing it from 12.5 to 8.5 u (p K\" 0.001) with a lesser reduction of systBnic vascular resistance from 24 to 19 u (p ~ 0.001). Mean systemic arterial pressure decreased 19 n~W~g with H and was associated with a reflex tachycardia (+ 15 beats/rain). Tachycardia v~s not observed with U but the moen arterial pressure fell -13 nnd~g. ~an pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) decreased with Urapidil from 44 to 36 ~ (p <0.001) but PAP was unchanged with H. lhe cardiac index increased less with U (+0.5 I/min/m 2, p < 0.001) than H (+1.4 I/min/m 2, p < 0.001). Mean pulmonary capillary v~dge pressure did not change with either drug. A decreased mean right atrial pressure was only observed with U (from 11 to 7 n~Hg, p<0.001) and correlated with an increased stroke volune index (R = 0.79), decreased PVR (R = 0.78) and decreased ~ (R = 0.65). We assLme these values reflect a reduced right ventricular afterload and in~preved right ventricular function. We observed no change of PaO 2 or venous admixi~re with either drug. Qur results dmonstrate that Urapidil reduces pulmonary hypertension and i~roves right ventricular function without deleterious effects on gas exchange. In contrast to Hydralazine therapy, Urapidil avoided s~i}~ic hypotension and lowered the PAP in all ten patients. This study was designed to investigate the effect of clonidine on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in an acute model of pulmonary hypertension (PH). In 8 anesthetized, ventilated dogs measurements were taken at 3 levels of flow by opening A-V shunts as follows: i) control condition; 2) after microembolization of pulmonary vasculature with glass beads (80); 3) post i.v. clonidine 7.5 mcgkg-l; 4) after i .v. yohimbine. Plasma catecholamines were measured and pulmonary pressure-flow slope (PVR) and pressure intercept at 0 flow (PAI) were calculated. Microemholization significantly increased PA r from 9 to 22 mmHg and PVR from 1.6 to 5.2 mmHgL -I min -I (p < .001). Plasma NE rose from 90 + 26 to 146 + 20 pgml -I (p < .01). Clonidine significantly r~duced PVR to 3.5mmHgL -I min -I (p < .01). This was associated with 45% decrease in plasma NE (p < .01), PAI was unchanged. A reduction in HR of 30% (p < .01) was associated with a 20% reduction in CO and BP (p < .05). Yohimbine returned all values towards occlusion condition.",

            "text": "The 35% reduction in PVR produced by clonidine can be explained by the reduction of circulating NE secondary to reduction of central noradrenergic sympathetic outflow and/or by its inhibitory presynaptic 2 action resulting in a reduction of NE release in response to nerve stimulation. Myocardial 02 supply/demand ratio appears to have been improved in view of the significant reduction of PA and HR, while the fall of BP was small and likely of little physiological impact on coronary perfusion pressure and flow. Clonidine may he useful in treatment of PH when there is increased vasomotor tone, due to increased sympathetic outflow. There is some evidence that calcium channel blockers may influence intrapulmonary shunting (Qs/Qt) due to changes in cardiac output.

Hemodynamic data as well as arterial and mixed venous blood gas parameters were measured before and 30 min after drug infusion. Results: Nimodipine and nifedipine significantly increased cardiac output (+44%; +39%) whereas pulmonary vascular resistance was reduced (-25%; -28%). PaO 2 was increased significantly, (+16%; +13%), too; Qs/Qt remained almost unchanged. In contrast to this the increase in cardiac output induced by dopamine (+27%) was accompanied by a significant correlation between change in CO and change in Qs/Qt. TNG application did not alter shunting, but pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) decreased markedly (-19%).",

The causes of respiratory failure were : polytrauma (15), abdominal surgery (9), drug overdosage (4), pneumonia (4). IPPV or CPPV were performed during 8.8 \u00b1 6.5 day~ Weaning was begun when traditional criteria were obtained ; the vital capacity (VC) and inspiratory force (IF) were measured. Patients were weaned via a T-Piece; IMV was not employed. Extubation was performed when patients were able to tolerate 4 hours of spontaneous ventilation. A score was retrospectively calculated for the 12 hours preceding the initiation of the weaning process. This score is calculated by assigning points from 0 to 4 to 20 component factors ; these factors are related to the medical status of the patient (age, fever, consciousness, respiration, hemodynamism, psychological and nutritional status). Results : 29 patients were extubated ; 6 were reintubated. 5 patients could not be weaned and were not extubated. The score of the 9 patients who failed to wean (11.4 \u00b1 2.4) was different (p < 0.0001) from the s~re of the 23 successfully weaned and extubated patients (4.6 \u00b1 2.9). CV and IF were not different. Assessing a value of lees than 8 as a test of ability to wean generated a sensitivity of 92 ~ and a specificity of 100 ~ ; the predictive poeitive value was 100 and the predictive negative value 71 ~. Conclusion : the score proposed which is easy to calculate correlatm with the ability of patients to wean and might serve to direct treatment toward problems that need to be corrected to facilitate the weaning process.",

            "text": "We conclude: HFOV may be a promising rescuetechnique in infants with severe respiratory failure. Pulsed-doppler echocardiography allows the exact and noninvasive bedside monitoring of the cardiac output, even in premature infants. To analyse the hemodynamic changes with increasing positive endexpiratory pressures (PEEP),we studied 8 premature infants by simultaneous pulsed-doppler echocardiography and blood pressure measurement (aortic catheter/dinamap). The PEEP was increased from a basal level of 0 mbar to 4 mbar, and than to 8mbar. As only relative changes of the systemic (Qs) and pulmonary blood flow (Qp) were analysed, the aortic and pulmonary diameters -a major source of inaccuracy in doppler-flow-measurementshad not to be taken into account. When the PEEP was increased from 0 to 4 mbar, Qs and Qp decreased only slightly (Qs=-8.2%;SO~4.5;NS/ Qp 9.8%.SD= 14.5;NS), while the systemic resistence increased slightly (Rs=8.4%;SD=18.1;NS).Only the left ventricular stroke volume decreased significantly(-12.7%;SD=9.8;p=O.02). When the PEEP was further increased to 8 mbar a significant impairment of cardiac performance occured: there was a 32.5% decrease of Qs (SD:I2.6;p=O.O01), a 27.6% decrease of Qp (SD=I3.7;p=O.O05), and a 55.7% increase of Rs (SD=34.1; p=O.O05). The heart rate (o%;SD:4.5;NS) and the mean arterial pressure (I.6%;SD:9.1;NS) remained constant. The left and right ventricular stroke volume showed a similar depression (-32.6%;SD=I3.5;p=O.OO5/-27.7%;SD=I3.5;p=O.O05). IN CONCLUSION premature infants seem to be rather sensltive to an increased positive endexpiratory pressure, with a significant reduction of the systemic and pulmonary blood flow, the left and right ventricular stroke volume, and a reflectory increase of the systemic vascular resistance. Surprisingly, there was no consistent reflectory change of the heart rate in premature infants. Several prognostic scores have been proposed to predict the evolution of MS. Such studies, since performed at admission are only STATIC. The comparison of sequential hemodynamic patterns in S and NS represents a DYNAMIC study. PATIENTS : Eighteen patients : 12 S : mean age 26+18 months 6 NS 27+30 months. The prognostic score (I) was lower for S + O.4~i ~ than for NS + 1.831.7 (P < 0.05). All were treated by ~npicillin. Shock was treated by vascular expansion (VE) dopamine and/or dobutamine according to the hemodynamic monitoring results. METHODS : All were monitored with termlstor-tipped pulmonary artery catheters (Edwards Lah) Cardiac output was measured by thermal dilution (Model 9520 Edwards Lab.) Normal cardiopulmonary variables values were chosen according to Pollack and al. (2) . Sequential sets of variables were averaged every 6 hours since the beginning of septic shock and compared between S and NS, by paired t.test. RESULTS : No significant differences between S and NS were found for heart rate,cardiac index (CI), systolic index (Sl),central venous pressure (CVP),pulmonary artery pres-sur% right ventricular stroke work index. However for all those parameters sequential values of S reached rapidly the normal range. Significant differences (P < O.01) were found for Pulmonary Wedge Pressure (PWP) mean arterial pressure and left ventricular stroke work index. The sequential pattern's study showed that : l)Both groups (S and NS) had hypovolemia (HV), early myocardial incompetence (MI) 2)However for S, MI was prominent and improved progressively, whereas, for NS, HV was prominent and persisted despite VE (low PWP, CVP, CI). This suggests massive capillary leaks secondary to endotoxin aggression. CONCLUSION : Further improvement in survival should be expected from an early t~eatmemt of endotoxin aggression in order to reduce massive capillary leaks. Mean birth weight of the PI was 1116 \u00b1 294 g, gestational age 29,1 \u00b1 2,4 weeks, mean age at operation 15 days. Preoperative morbitity due to airleaks, septicemia and renal failure was high. 27% were unsuccessfully treated with, others had some contraindications for treatment with indomethacin. All PI had clinical and echocardiographic evidence of a symptomatic PDA. Postoperative respiratory depression from anesthesia, intraoperative heat loss and hypotension due to hypoxia were the main perioperative problems. For shortening the time spent in the operating room nearly all procedures for preparing the patient for general anaesthesia should take place in the intensive care unit. There were no intraoperative but 5 early postoperative deaths: 4 PI with septicemia and 1 with recurrent tension pneumothorax. Morbidity due to BPD (45%) was high and correlated closely to iow gestational age. There were 11 late deaths (9 BPD, 1 NEC, 1 Septicemia). Operative closure of PDA is a safe procedure but should only be performed if treatment with indomethacin is contraindicated or fails to close the PDA. The surgieal closure of s-PDA in very premature infants is often necessary when medical treatment is ineffective.

However, in animals ventilated with PEEP, hydration resulted in a greater reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) than in non hydrated animals (1). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of CPAP and continuous positive pressure ventilation (CPPV) on CBF in patients after open heart surgery.

The investigations were done under the following conditions : 1) without PEEP, 2) with PEEP 15 cm H20, 3) with PEEP 15 cm H20 associated with three different methods to obtain the same BP as without PEEP : a) infusion of ~opamine (D) : 18 explorations (26 \u00b1 29 ~/ kg/mn), b) 20 ~ al~umin : 11 explorations (290 + 90 ml), c) plasma protein fraction (PPF) : 9 explorations (1100 \u00b1 42 CPP = BP-ICP VE = volume expansion. in two groups to receive isoenergetic (35 kcal/kg BW) and isonitrogenous (0,24 g N/kg BW) TPN during 6 days. 12 patients received 6.0 g/kg glucose and 0.5 g/kg fat (G-group) and 13 patients were given 3-5 g/kg glucose and 1.7 g/kg fat (F-group 24-36 h after trauma (basal period) 35 critically iii pts received TPN providing AA (three different solution with varied proportion of the same AA) and lsocaloric amount either of glucose (G) or of lipids (L I/3) plus G (2/3). 4 subsets resulted: a) 32 kcal/kg G and N 0.35 g/kg sol 2; 5) 31 kcal/kg G and N 0.34 g/kg sol 3; c) 2g kcal/kg G and N 0.23 g/kg sol I; d) SO kcal/kg G/L and N 0.24 g/kg sol I. Irrespectively of the basal plasmatic (p) concentration, either normal (Leu, Ile, Phe, Met, Arg) or decreased (Val, Lys, Thr, Gly, His,) (Try not evaluated), the given AA p values were normalized or increased as a function of the infused amount, without difference between the caloric sources. Not given AA showed a variable pattern, Orn was normallzed in all subsets, while Asp, Cys, G1u, Tau (basal normal) and A1a, Ann, ~ Ab. Tyr normalized varlabIy; however their p concentration was related (multlple regression analysis) with p values of their direct Forerunner (Ser-Gly, Orn-Arg, Tyr-Phe, Cys-Met and Tau-Cys), with non protein kcai input and NO (Set, Tyr, Cys negatively and Orn positively). Nevertheless sol i wich furnished a lower total N intake, showed the worst NB (-0.110 D.O07 sol I vs 0.040 + 0.001 sol 2 and 0.035 + 0.015 sol 3 p<D.001 both), indicating that infused N posseses a mass action. This study, selecting between three different inputs, indicates the best one to normalized p concentration, granting that normalization means an appropriate load. Moreover it enables us to Find out the factors influenclng the p concentration of some dispensable AA, whilst not normalized by the treatment (Set, Cys, Tau, Tyr) as well as it demonstrates the ~omplete dispensability of Orn, Asp, Glu and~Ab. Inhibition of key enzymes as phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and citrate synthetase (CS) may be connected with increased gluceaeogenesis, ketogenesis, disturbances of glucose metabolism and low RQ values. Methods: Two computer programs were developed to calculate the activities of PFK, PDH and CS in stress metabolism. They concern the metabolism of carbohydrate and fat including gluconeogeneeis and lipogenesis as well as amino acid degradation to keto-and glucoplastic metabolits. By these programs we were able to analyze the results of metabolic studies, which were carried out on four severely ill traumatized patients during total parenteral nutrition. Results: There are significant inhibition of the three enzymes we analyzed and a severe reduction of substrate metabolism. The calculated maximal activity of PFK was 1.59 mol/d, of PDH 6.31 mol/d and that of CS 6.55 mol/d. We also calculated high rates of gluconeogenesis (max. 378 g/d) and lipogenesis (max. 511 g/d). The overflow of glucose was maximal 378 g/d, and of acetyl-CoA maximal 641 g acetyl /d. Discussion: The results confirm metabolic situations which are characterized by increased gluconeogenesis, accumulation of doable-binded metabolits (e. g. acetyl-CoA and its metabolits) or saturated compounds (e. g. glucose and fatty acids) as well as marked inhibition of PFK, PDH and CS. The activities of these enzymes are far below the values of normal h~an beings. Conclusion: We mean, that enzyme inhibition is an important factor in the developement of metabolic disturbances in SM. They also can explain low RQ values in spite of high carbohydrate intake. After severe head injuries there is a intense hypermetab_o lism and an accelerated protein catabolism. Nitrogen balan ee (NB) was measured in 13 males and 7 females eomatouse head injured patients without other major injuries and not treated with stereids,ac~nitted into our intensive care t~it with Glasgow Coma Score 7. Nutritional support was increased up to 54.1+ 13.8 Cal/Kg/day and to 0.31+O.il gN/ }(g/day given as early parenteral nutrition in the first days,while tube feeding was begun 6~2 days after admission. With this nutritional regimen we achieved a total caloric intake over 2500 Cal/day within day 4. All patients were investigated for 22 consecutive days as follows: daily NB, twice a week sert~n albt~nin and total sertm preteins,sert~n transferrin,lymphocyte count,C 3 and C 4 complement fraction, serum cortisol, and weekly urinary catecholamines and body weigth together with cutaneous plicometry. NB was deeply negative up to 16 days after tretma and increased slowly to positive values about 21 days after injury. Despite the hyperalimentation there was a mean negative NB of i0 g N/ day with a urinary nitrogen excretion over 0.50 g N/Kg/day. The eortisol level was high only in the first week while urinary eatecholsmines showed an initial increase with a subsequent fall down inthe first week followed with a persistent high level in the 2nd and 3rd week. The high prote in catabolisrm that is tipical of severe head injure d patients could be related to other factors and not only to cortiso] and catecholamines serum levels, and is not linked with steroid therapy. A quantitative analysis of pulmonary capillary leakage as in ARDS requires not only the recording of extravasc6lar lung water (EVLW) but also of the drainage of the lung (lymph flow). This study presents a dog model enabling such recordings during long-term experiments. Material and methods. 12 anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs (mean:20 kg) received a pulmonary artery thermistor catheter, a fibre-optic thermistor cath~ ter the tip being positioned in the aortic root, and additional arterial and venous lines. EVLW was measured by double indicator (dye-cold, dilution technique, both indicators measured intravascularly). Lymph cannulations were performed on the thoracic duct (TD) at the neck and the right lymphatic duct (RLD). The TD was also cannulated at the level of the diaphragm (TDA). RLD+TD=thoracic lymph flow (TLF). Results and conclusions. The extensive lymph duct surgery (approx. 6 h) had no effect on EVLW which was on average 9.2 ml/kg, TLF was 4.1 ml/h, and abdominal lymph flow (TDA) 58 ml/h, underscoring the importance of separating TDA and TLF. Short periods (I h) of PEEP did not affect EVLW but reduced TLF to 2.6 ml/h, and increased TDA to 111 ml/h. Oleic acid injection (mean:O.053 ml/kg) caused an increase in EVLW to 20.0 ml/kg after 2 h, leveling off at 24.8 ml/ kg after 4 h. Concomitantly, TLF increased 5 times, to 21.7 ml/h. TDA increased to 69 ml/h. The restoration of EVLW to normal would have required a minimum of 7 h (assuming non-leaking pulmonary capillaries), stressing the necessity of long-term studies on lung water balance. PEEP is associated with two risks in relation to lymph mechanics: i) increased lung edema due to blocked lymph transport; 2) increased edema in a surgical area due to its high compliance for lymph. Recent papers point out, that total intrathoracic blood volume (IVV) seems to be a more accurate indicator of volume requirements in ventilated subjects than PCWP (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). We compared the effects of PEEP on PCWP, RA to PA blood volume (prepulmonary, IVVpp), and total IVV in dogs. lO dogs (32 kgBW) were anesthetized with metomidate, paralyzed with alcuroniumchloride and put on artificial ventilation (Servo 900 C). Fiberoptic-thermistor catheters were placed placed into pulmonary artery (PA,7F Swan-Ganz type) and femoral artery (FA, 5F lung water cath.) for measurement of PCWP, IVVpp and IVV with dye dilution (PULSION COLD-System). IVV is yielded by: IVV = COxMTTFA, where CO = cardiac output, MTT/FA = mean transit time of centralvenously injected dye from FA dye curve. IVVpp calculates by analogy from MTT/PA. ZEEP, 7.5, and 15 cmH~O PEEP was adjusted. 15 min stabilization time were allowed before measurements were taken at each endexpiratory level (EEP Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may improve gas exchange in acute respiratory failure by recruiting lung volume and reducing intrapulmonary shunt. The effect of PEEP on pulmonary fluid balance, however, remains contraversial. We have examined the effect of short and long periods of PEEP (0.5 h and 8 h) on extravascular lung water (EVLW) and central blood volume (CBV), Methods. Mongrel dogs (n:18, mean weight 16 kg) were anaesthetized and ventilated mechanically. They received a pulmonary artery thermistor catheter, a fibre-optic thermistor catheter with the tip being positioned in the aortic root, and additional arterial and venous lines.EVLW was measured by double indicator (dye-cold) dilution technique, both indicators being measured intravascularly. The animals were ventilated according to one of the following regimes (I) PEEP 10 cm H20 for 0.5 h (n=7), (II) PEEP 10 cm H20 for 8 h (n=6), or (III) 8 h of mechanical ventilation without PEEP (control n=5). The dogs were sacrificed and EVLW wag determined gravimetrically by the modified method of Pearce (Selinger et ai.1975) . Results. In the 0.5 h PEEP dogs, EVLW was unchanged, concomitantly with a15% reduction in cardiac output (CO) and CBV. When PEEP was discontinued, all variables returned to control. In the 8 h PEEP dogs EVLW gradually increased to +35% of control, the increase being significant (p<O.05) after 2 h. CBV and CO were reduced by 15% after 2 h (p<O.05), and then slowly increased. In the control dogs EVLW remained unchanged after 8 h ventilation. Gravimetrically determined EVLW was 61% higher in the 8 h PEEP dogs (7.1 g/kg) than in the control dogs (4.4 g/kg). Conclusion. Longer period of PEEP has negative effects on lung fluid balance, by causing interstitial lung edema. Q~antitative evaluation of biventricular volumes is controversial during spontaneous breathing with different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). l~ne purpose of the present study was to investigate in a group i0 yonng healthy volLlnteers, the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on left and right ventricular function. Biventrieular fLmction was assessed by multiple-gated equilibri~ cardiac scintigraphy with 99 m ~c sodium pertechnetate in ten normal subjects~ (25-55 yr old), during CPAP via face mask at 0,5, b0 and 15 cm. R20 of PEEP. Radionuclide angiogram~ were performed in basal situation and after ten minutes breathing with the different levels of PEEP. Heart rate and mean systemic arterial blood pressure did not change. Ejection fraction (EF) of both ventricles remained unchanged. Cardiac output (CO) decreased significantly with 10 and 15 cm H20 of PEEP. l~he table s~rnarized the changes of biventricular volumes at different levels of PEEP: End-diastolic (F~V) and stroke VOILLme (SV) significantly decreased. The mechanism of reduced cardiac output(CO) during PEEP remains controversial. Impaired right ventricular(RV) contractility and a displacement of the interventricular septum(IVS) could contribute to this side-effect. The purpose of this study, performed in 24 anesthetized dogs, was to analyze global RV contractility as derived from intraventricular pressure measurements (Vma x) simultaneously with local contractility (percent shortening %S) of the RV free walI[RVFW) during different levels of PEEP (I0,15,20cmH20). Local contractility as well as RV and LV diameter (Drv, Dlv) were assessed by sonomicrometry. Phasic pressures in the RV, LV, right atrium, pulmonary artery, aorta and pleural space were recorded. CO was measured by thermodilution. Regional ischemia of the RVFW was induced by ligature of the right coronary artery ( 101\u00b15 3.0\u00b1.I -0.6~.5 28.3\u00b1.5 30.9~1.8 PEEP had no effect on global RV contractility, while local RV contractility deteriorated. CO decreased independent upon regional ischemia of the RVFW. This effect was more pronounced with the pericardium closed. Changes of Drv and Dlv indicated a shift of the IVS to the left. At higher levels PEEP caused a deformation of the LV pressure-diameter loop indicating a rearrangement of ventricular dynamic geometry. Acquired defect of Protein C, a vitamin\u00b1 K dependent plasma glyeoprotein, could induce the formation of micro-throm~ hi as observed in inherited deficiency. So its plasmatic concentration (PCp) has been assessed in acute critical diseases (ACD) characterized by extensive endothelial damage and activation of blood clotting. 28 ACD were studied : 13 ARDS, 6 acute bacterial pneumonias (ABP), 9 severe sepsis ($8) and ]1 toxic comas (TC). Control group consisted of 30 healthy subjects. PCp (%) was measured using immune-enzymatic assay (ELISA). Coagulation factors performed were : V, Vlllc, prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count (Pie). Liver tests assessed were : albumin (Ab), total bilirubin (TB) and AST. The levels of PCp (E \u00b1 SE) are given in the PCp levels normal in TC were lowered in ACD.",

Neuraminidase activity was determined in 80 patients referred to our ICU because of multiple injuries (2B pts,35%),major abdominal surgery (23 pts, 29%),neurosurgical procedures or brain injuries (9 pts,11%),and cardiovascular surgery (20 pts,25%).A11 patients required controlled ventilation, > 3 d in 49 of 80 pts (61%).24 healthy blood donors served as controls.

CONCLUSION:Mean maximal serum neuraminidase activity in the patient group was clearly higher than in the controls; maximal activity was significantly higher in the nonsurvivors (p<O.O5).These findings support the increasing body of evidence indicating a pathophysiologic relevance of neuraminidase-induced in vivo effects,due probably to the unmasking of membrane cryptantigens. The hypothesis of the present study was that administra~on of phosphates might modify the affinity of 02 for haemoglobin and thus improve 02 delivery to the tissues.' Fifteen patients have been treated in intensive care unit for diabetic ketoacedosis : six patients (Group A; age 45y+13) received phosphate (mean total amount of 277 mEq) and-the nine others did not (Group B; age 45y+21). At admission, glycaemia were 680+186 (A) and 728+47~ (B), respectively. The table gives th~amount of phosphate administered and the values for (H+), PCO 2, 2,3DPG, plasma phosphate level (P) and in vivo P50 : this index is equal to the measured P50 corrected for (H+), T, PC02, 2,3PDG and HBCO of the arterial blood. We studied the effect of fluid replacement on extravascular lung water (EVLW) in 8 patients with DKA (blood glucose 300 mg/dl, pH<7.1). EVLW was determined by the thermal-dye technique. Blood gas analysis and oximetry were performed in arterial and mixed venous blood. Alveoarterial oxygen difference (AaD02) and venous admixture (Qs/Qt) were calculated from standard formulas. Colloid osmotic pressure (COP) was measured by membrane oncometry. All variables, including net fluid intake (NFI), were determined at admission (A), after initial fluid replacement (IFR), when blood glucose fell below 180 mg/dl, after 8 hours of glucose treatment (G), and after 24 hours of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Hypoxic lactic acidosis (HLA) is seen in states with impaired tissue oxygenation such as shock, acute lung failure or cardiac arrest. Recent evidence suggests that standard therapy with NaNCO~ has detrimental effects both metabolic and to t~e cardiovascular system. We therefore studied the systemic and metabolic effects of NaHCO 3 in a dog model of HLA using NaCI or no therapy as controls and compared them additionally to dichloroacetate (DCA), a substance proven effective in other form of lactic acidosis. HLA was induced in dogs by ventilating the with 8% On and 92% N2, yielding a blood pH<7.15, bicar bona~e il5mM, and lactate >5mM. treatment then f~ 60 min consisted of either NaHCO~ or NaCI 2 5 mV~ /kg/h, DCA 300 mg/kg/h, or 3 ' no therapy. Measurements included: blood gases, lactates, lactate production (skeletal muscle, gut) and extraction (liver), cardiac output and blood pressure. Therapy with NaHCO 3 resulted in decreases of cardiac output and blood pressure which were signif~ cantly greater then with no therapy and did not occur with NaCI or DCA. Blood lactates increased significantly more with NaHCO then with NaCI or no therapy, whereas blood lactates did not rise with DCA. Lactate production was not reduced with NaHCO^ but declined with NaCI and DCA. Liver lac-J rate extraction was enhanced with DCA but not wi~ any of the other regimens. Only DCA resulted in a significant increase of blood pH and bicarbonate.",

            "text": "Conclusion: DCA appears to reverse most of the systemic and metabolic abnormalities associated with HLA, thus warranting its experimental application in patients with HLA. The rational for the use of NaHCO 3 in HLA should be reconsidered. 107r polytrat~a patients with suspicion of abdcminal, thoracic or pelvic blunt trat~a admitted to the SICU between ist Jan 1983 and 1 Aug 1985 underwent total body CT examination as the primary diagnostic procedure. Positive CT findings were seen in 90 % of patients. Thoracic CT was positive in 79 cases and included: parenchymal infiltrates(61), tra~natic air cysts (4) pulmonary lacerations (2) and atelectasis (7). The topography and extension of the lesions was always better seen with CT than with conventional RX. Pleural lesions included pnet~nothorax (33), in 16 cases non visible on RX, h~aothorax (29) and extrapleural hematcma (7). In 14 cases drainage under CT control was perfcmed. 21 mediastinal lesions were seen, mostly pneumanediastin~n, a~i 1 left diaphragmatic hernia was diagnosed. Cr failed to show 1 right diaphragmahic rupture. Abdc~ninal and pelvic CT were positive in 69 patients and showed pelvic fractures (30) pelvic hematcrnas (29) hemoperitone~ (23) retroperitoneal he~atcma (9) and muscular wall hera--s (5). Parenchymatous organ lesions included: liver contusion (9) spleen contusion or laceration (8) kidney contusion (6) adrenal hematcma (2) pancreatic edema (2) . Urinary bladder ruptures (2) and inferior vena cava floating thrombus (i) ware shown and 2 mesenteric he~a~ were indirectly suspected. CT failed to show i biliary fistula, 2 bowel lacerations and 1 ureteral contusion.

A precise indication for further ibvasive procedures: angiography(3) ~bolisation (2) and laparotcmy (8) A neurogenic pulmonary edema of different genesis is a rarely observed but dramatically developing event. Between 1963 and 1985 we observed 20 cases ( 13 ~, 7 (2), who presented a neurogenie pulmonary edema after brain trauma. Their age was between 4 and 35 ( x = 21 ) years. Five patients had isolated brain trauma, and 15 patients were polytraumatically injured. In grad II died 3 of 9 patients, in grade III 9 of 11 died. The interval between accident and development of edema ranged between 15 minutes and 52 hours. The edema was symmetric in 16 and asymmetric in 4 instances, in one of the latter it was localized only on the left side. The pulmonary edema was dominated in 13, retrogressive in 4 and not influenced in 3 cases. All 12 deaths showed a contusion of the brain-stem, fat embolism was found in three cases, no cardiac insufficiencies were present. The treatment demands an invasive hemodynamic monitoring ( Cardiac Output, Cardiac Index, P A P, P C W P, total peripheral resistance etc. ), a controlled artificial respiration ( P E E P ), AIdosterone blockers, Dexamethasone, and a slightly negative fluid substitution. (6-75)) and thirtysix were men (meridian-age:53(3-90)).Forty-eight patients drowned in brackish water,5 in fresh water.The material were divided into two groups according to rescue at place of accident: Group I:37 patients recieved advanced resuscitation by anaesthesist. The effects of calcium chloride administration were blindly evaluated in a dog model of electromechanical dissociation (EMD) observed after ventricular fibrillation (I). In 16 mongrel dogs (16 ~ I kgs) anesthetized with pentobarbital, electrically-induced ventricular fibrillation was observed for 2 min before an external countershock was applied. CPR was started after 2 min of EMD using a CPR-thumper (Sirepuls -02, Siemens) to maintain systolic arterial pressure at 50-60 mm Hg. Three successive episodes of EMD included the blind administration every 2 min of adrenaline I mg (Adr-CPR), calcium chloride 500 mg (Ca-CPR) or D5W 5 ml (D5W-CPR).",

            "text": "Conclusions: The results show, that competition and induction of drug metabolism may occur simultaneously during multiple drug therapy, however, it is not shure that both mechanisms regularly result in changes of drug clearance. The preponderance of either mechanism for the elimination of certain drugs has to be evaluated. Introduction: Information about changes in drug clearance in critical care patients is very rare. Co-medication and severe illness may lead to changes in hepatic drug metabolism and thus in clearance of drugs primarily metabolized by oxidative processes. Methods: To evaluate hepatic drug clearance in septic shock patients pharmacokinetics of metamizol (Novalgin), hexobarbitone (Evipan) and meperidine (Dolantin ) were determined. These compounds have been used to study either capacity-or flow-limited hepatic drug metabolism activity. Results: Compared to febrile patients without renal insufficiency (n=20) mean half-life of metamizol was significantly prolonged from 3.1 + 1.6 h (range 1.2 -6.2 h) to 10.2 + B.2 h (range 2.9 -40.8 h) in patients with septic shock--and acute renal failure. Total plasma clearance decreased to one third. In patients wit21 septic shock alone also delayed elimination was found (tl/2 = 7.4 + 4.1 h). Decreased drug metabolism activity was evidence~by invasion kinetics of metamizol metabolites. A wide range in plasma clearance was found for hexobarbitone and meperidine, primarily dueto changes in volume of distribution. These data did not significantly differ from those found in healthy volunteers. Conclusion: The mechanism by which acute renal failure and sepsis act on drug metabolism activity remains unclear, however, it is likely that accumulation of drugs in these patients may lead to competition of drug oxidation. Changes in hepatic blood flow (e.g. by norepinephrine administration) seem to be of less importance in these patients. Mechanical ventilation (MV) was able to induce a decrease in cardiac output and regional blood flow, especially hepatic. In this setting hepatic elimination of drugs with high hepatic extraction ratio, which Was generally assessed to be linked with hepatic blood flow modification might be reduced. The aim of this work was to determine the MV effect on hepatic pharmacokinetics of a drug with high hepatic extraction such as lidocaine. 5 patients (mean age 58 years) with normal hepatic function and quite similar gazometric parameters before and after MVweaning were studied. With a wash out period of 48 hours between MV and spontaneous ventilation (SV) each patient was submitted to the following protocol : lidocaine bolus of 1,5 mg.kg-I followed by a 120 min lidocaine infusion of l~O to 1.7 mg. mg.min-I (calculated with reference to patient weight). Plasma samples were performed 5 min after bolus, at steady state and then 60, 120 and 240 min after the end of the infusion. Emit lidocaine assay was used for dosage. Using paired student t test the following parameters determined before and after MVweaning were compared : peak plasma concentration after bolus (Cp), steady state concentration (Css~ total clearance (Clt), elimination half life (t i/2) and distribution volume (Vd). The results were : Cp with MV was 3.22 \u00b1 0.37 (m \u00b1 sam) versus 2.40 i 0.35 mg.l -I with SV (p < 0.02). Css with MV was 2.10 i 0.20 versus 1.64 i 0.16 mg.l-I with SV (p < 0.01). Clt was 604.2 \u00b1 87.0 with MVversus 775.0 i 112.1 ml.min -] with SV (p < 0.01). t 1/2 was with SV 245.2 i 50.6 versus 160.O \u00b1 40.6 min with SV (p < 0.05). Vd was 188.6 \u00b1 50.2 with MV and 183.0 \u00b1 50.81 with SV (NS). Our preliminary results clearly indicated a decrease in lidocaine elimination in patients submitted to MV. The amplitude of dosage reduction of high hepatic extracted drug in patients submitted to ~V remains to he determined. Intravenous lidocaine is s first line agent for treatment of acute ventricular arrhythmias. Its clinical use is limited by the large interindividual variability in the dose-concentration relationship. We present a clinical evaluation of a computerized dosing method to individually adjust the lidocaine dose. Sixty-four patients with acute isohsmic heart disease, treated with lidooaine because of ventricolar arrhythmias, were studied. In all, the infusion rata was individually adjusted immediately following a drug level measurement 2 h after starting therapy to achieve a lidocaine serum concentration [C L) of 3.5 mg/l. In 22 patients the dose adjustment was performed with the help of a microcomputer program using a Bayesian forecasting technique and a two-compartment pharmeeoKinetic model. Forty-one patients served as control. CL was again measured 12 h after starting therapy and compared with ths target. Although the average C L was close to 3.5 mg/l in both groups ~eomputer-aided: 3.5~0.5B, oontrol~ 3.8+1.18), the interindividual variability was significantly smaller with the Bayesian #oreo~sting method [p<O.05]. Only I of 22 patients had C L outside the re commended range [2-5 mg/1] in the oomputer-aidsd group compared to 9 of 41 in the controls. Analysis of the serum concentration-effect relationship revealed a significant reduction in the frequency of recurrent ventriculsr arrhythmias with C L >2 mg/l [p<O.05). The results show that the computerized forecasting technique outperforms the physician in individualized dose adjustment for lidoceine. The comparative effects of dopamine and dobutamine on right ventricular (RV) function were studied in 9 critically ill patients (median age 58, range 43-83 years) during an episode of acute respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema. Each patient was treated with continuous positive pressien ventilation (Fi02 0.3 to 0.5; PEEP 5 to 10 cm H20).",

However the morphological evidence to support this hypothesis is scanty. We studied I0 ARF patients by CT scanning conducted at three lung levels: apex hilum and basis.

In the present study the capacity of various bacterial endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides (LPS)) to stimulate the release of oxygen radicals in whole blood and isolated blood cells was investigated.

RESULTS: When blood was incubated with 10 to 100 pg/ml LPS, CL was 2 to 10 fold enhanced, respectively. In contrast, in isolated blood cells, especially polymorphnuclear leucocytes (PMNL), and plasma LPS failed to augment radical formation at even higher concentrations. LPSincubated plasma (50 pg/ml) exhibited no change in CL when added to whole untreated blood. However, plasma of LPS-incubated whole blood (50 pg/ml) induced a 10 fold increase in CL when given to untreated blood, but had only minor effects on isolated PMNL. CONCLUSION: Production of oxygen free radicals in blood in the presence of LPS is the result of complex cell-cell interactions. Thus, LPS most likely acts indirectly via mediators of cellular origin. Because the free radical formation in blood is caused by very low concentrations of LPS this effect might be of pathophysiological significance in the development of ARDS. Thermal-dye estimations of extravascular lung water have repeatedly failed to demonstrate the presence of pulmonary edema in inhalation injury patients. This situation was evaluated in a sheep model. Instrumented sheep were anesthetized and intubated with a Carlens tube. One lung was insufflated with cotton-smoke, the other with air (SM; n = 12). In a sham group (C; n=6) both lungs were insufflated with air. The injury produced carboxyhemoglobin levels of 50!3,3 % (data are mean + SE) and 24 hrs. later the pa02 was decreased, Tntrapulmonary shunt and pulmonary vascular resistance were increased, while wedge pressure and plama protein were unchanged from baseline. At this time EVLW-determinations showed no change from the baseline data in both groups. Gray(metric analysis, however, showed the development of edema in the smoke-exposed lungs. The blood free wet-weight/dry-weight (WI/DI) ratio of the smoke~ exposed lungs was significantly higher when compared to the oontralateral and the sham-group lungs. Poor perfusion of the smoke exposed lungs 24 hrs.after injury was demonstrated by euthanizing another group of sheep that underwent the same protocol with an agent that causes a red coloration of well perfused lung areas. Inaccuracy of the thermal dye technique thus may be the result of poor perfusion of injured areas. We determined the effect of repeated endotoxemias on lung function. Six sheep were given i ~g/kg E. coli endotoxin every 12 hr for 5 days then followed for 3 more days. We noted a two-phase response with all endotoxemias with an initial pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia followed by an increase in protein permeability reflected in an increase in protein-rich lung lymph, Q With initial injections peak P increased from a L' ' a baseline of 19\u00b13 ram Hg to 44\u00b15 m~Bg ~nd a 3-4 fold increase in 20Q~-Plasma and lymph TxB? increased from a baseline of and 220 pg/ml to greater than 2000 pg/ml while 6-kato-PGF increased from I00 and 130 pg/ml to 450\u00b160 and >i~0 pg/ml, respectively. .With subsequent doses, the peak increase in P and Q were pa L only 30\u00b14 mmHg and a two-fold increase, respeetlvely.

We conclude that with repeated endotoxemia, the pulmonary response is markedly attenuated as is the prostanoid release, while a modest pulmonary hypertension persists after endotoxin is discontinued. Repeated endotoxemias do not result in a sustained sepsis-induced ARDS. Mechanical ventilation is e leading supportive therapy of ARDS. Alvanle\u00a3 distension may result from it and could interfere with lung heeling.

            "text": "The following parameters were correlated : Pa02 and PaO2/Fi02, serum trypsin and lipase levels. Normal values for trypsin levels were determined in 50 healthy subjects (normal value ; 39,3 ~ 23,6 ng/ml = mean ~ 2 SD). Results are expressed as mean + SEM. On admission, 13 out of 15 pts had normal (n=9) or subnormal (n=4) trypsin level (64,2 + 12,8 ng/m i). The last 2 pts showed elevated trypsin lev~l (respectively 340 and 506 ng/ml), but both had an associated hepatic or pancreatic pathology. Among the 13 pts with a normal trypsin level, IO already presented with lung infiltrates and hypoxemia. The 3 other pts developed the same clinical picture over the 48 hours following admission. An increase in trypsin level was observed in all cases. In patients with hypoxemia upon admission (n=lO), the mean delay was 3,0 days thereafter; in the others (n=3), it was 3,3 days after the onset of hypoxemia. The peak levels (746,5 + 282 ng/ml) were achieved after 5,4 days (range 2-10). In all but one case, changes in lipase levels showed a parallel evolution of similar amplitude. In conclusion, pancreatic Lnjury follows the pulmonary lesions responsible for ARDS. Thus, trypsin cannot be the primary determinant of lung injury but may act as a secondary aggravating factor. Continuously infused catecholamines, including epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine are clinically useful vasopressor drugs when administered in doses at which ~t-agonism predominates. H~er, vascular smooth muscle cells are able to modulate their response to administered vasoactive drugs. Thus, tissues that have been exposed to a high ambient catecholamine level often demonstrate a reduced ability to respond to a fresh challenge of the adrenoceptor agonist. The process by which cells or tissues adapt to these elevated levels of catecholamines has been termed \"desensitization\". We have explored this phencr~non by infusing epinephrine (E) into awake rabbits for 2h and then assessing s~ooth muscle contraction, both in vivo and ex vivo. E was infused at a rate of I ug/min which resulted in a 15-fold increase in the plasma E-concentration. The dose of phenylephrine (PE) required to cause a 25 ~nHg increase in MAP significantly increased from 109\u00b156 ug prior to the infusion to 261\u00b1143 at the end of the 2h infusion (p< O.01). The sensitivity to PE remained decreased when reassessed 2h later. Untreated control rabbits displayed no change in ~-adrenergic responsiveness when assessed at 2 hourly intervals over the time-course of the experiment. In a second set of experiments, contraction of aortic rings r~moved from both E-treated and control rabbits was determined in vitro in tissue baths. The EC50 of norepinephrineinduced contraction, as a measure of sensitivity, increased from 31_+6 to 210\u00b120 nM while there was also a 30% decrease in the maximal force of contraction (I~nax) in treated vessels. The EC50 only partially recovered after 4h of incubation ex vivo, while the Emax was restored to the control value. We conclude that desensitization of ~-adrenergic mediated vascular contractility develops rapidly in vivo and is only slowly reversible after removel of the agonist. In patients with severe hepatic disease a diminished vascular tone and impairment in renal water and sedit~n excretion is known. We have studied the effect of the ~asoconstrictor ernipressin on hemodynamics and renal function in 7patients with decc~i~_nsated cirrhosis. After a preperied of 2 hours ornipressln (6U/h POR 8 R) was infused over 4 hours, followed by a postperied of 2 hours. Arterial pressures, cardiac output, right atrial (CVP) and pulm. cap. wedge pressure(PCP) were measured every two hours using a teflon catheter in the f~oral artery and thermodilution cathater inserted via a central vein. In the s~e t~D hoursperieds urine volume (U~ creatinine clearance (CrCI) and fractionated Sodi~ excretion (FENa) was measured. Plas~anorepinephrine concentration (NA) was estimated before and during ornipressin infusion. 6U/h POR 8 increased mean arterial pressure from 77 +14 to 102+16n~Hg, which led to a decrease of the heart rate fr~ 102+19 to 75+12 b/min and a decrease of CI from 5.1 +1.7 to 4.1TI.1 L/mid.m2. Uv increased from 1.14+1 1 toZ64 ~2.58 ml/min, CrCl frcm 33.9+26.9 to 56+38.8\"ml~in undFENa frc~n 0.73+0.84to 2.78+4%. NA--concentratYon increased from 2.1+0.2 t~ 1.3_+0.3 ngTml. (p<O.OO1) These data show that a vasoconstricting agent like POR 8 R can \"normalize\" h~nodynamic data of patients with deccrq~_nsated cirrhosis. This is accar~oonaied by an increase in uri~ ne output, sodit~n excretion and creatinine clearance. Although no correlation could be found between the extent of increase in blood pressure and increase in CrCI or FENa, an increase of the perfusion pressure se~ns to be the most likely explanation for the enhancement of renal function. Per~ haps this was potentiated by direct of indirect induced renal vasodilation. The h6rnodynamic effects of ornipressin including the effect on catecholamine concentration give further evidence of a normal function of the baroreceptor syst~n in patients with decar~ensated cirrhosis. Anesth.,**Inst. Surg. Res., Univ. Munich, M~nchen, +Dep. of Exp. Surgery, Univ. Heidelberg, FRG The systemic application of vasopressin (VP)is associated with a redistribution of the reduced zardiac output from gut to skeletal muscle. The effects of the i.v. \u00b1nfusion of VP (0,014 E/kg/ min) on microvascular diameter, flow pattern and local Pto 2 were investigated in the striated muscle in the dorsal skin fold chamber of awake hamsters. Methods: Intravital fluorescence micros-~pyand quantitative video techniques were used: the microvascular diameters were determined by image-shearing, the blood cell velocity (BCV) by the \"dual slit\" method combined with cross-correlation, the capillary density according to ste~ological principles. The Pto 2 was measured with a platinum multiwire surface electrode. Results: VP produced a significant decrease of the diameters of arterioles (-11%) and precapillaries (-7%) whereas the diameter of the postcapillary segrents remained unchanged. The BCV was diminuished significantly in all segments, consequently also c~ culated volume flow and shear rates. Upon VP capillary density remained unchanged, but in one third of all capillaries stagnant flow (veloc\u00b1-ties<0,1 mm/sec) was present, resulting in a decrease of Pro9 mean value (-6,4 mmHg) and increase of hypoxic values in the Pto -histogram. Furthermore stagnant flow was observed in 65% of all postcapillary vessels suggesting decreased blood fluidity as result of critically low shear rates in these segments. Conclusions: At the given dosage VP induced a low flow state in the microcirculation of skin muscle with reduction, of Pro2 due to an increased resistance to flow into the precaoillary and out of the postcapillary vessel Segment.

Schulte am Esch, Department of Anesthesiology, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg The influence of long-term-sedation (fentanyl/morphine in combination with flunitrazepam/midazolam) on the adrenocortical system of critically ill patients was studied. Methods: In 36 critically ill surgical patients (ASA:lll-IV~equiring mechanical ventilation the following regimes for sedation were used: Midazolam/morphine (n=9), midazolam/fentanyl (n=12),flunitrazepam/fentanyl (n=I5). Plasma levels of ACTH, cortisol, prolactin were determined twice and the urinary excretion of 17-OHCS and unbound cortisol (UC) daily on at least 5 days in succession. Results: Plunitrazepam/fentanyl and midazolam/ fentanyl: Une~eady state infusions of flunitrazepam (i0-30 mg/d) or midazolam (100-290 mg/d) and fentanyl (45 mg/d) cortisol plasma levels were between 60 and 120 ng/ml (norm: 60-250 ng/ml); increasing fentanyl (>8 mg/d) caused a depression of ACTH (410 pg/ml;norm:lO-50 pg/ml) in 18 patients with a corresponding fall in cortisol (450 ng/ml). Midazolam/morphine: Replacement of fentanyl with morphine caused slightly more depressed cortisol levels (430 ng/ml; ACTH410 ng/ml). Benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam: 10-25 mg/d; midazoiam:i00-220 mg/d) had only minor effects on the plasma cortisol (-109) . Within all groups 17-OHCS and UC were found normal. Prolactin responded with peak values to bolus injections of fentanyl or morphine. The circardian rhythm was lost in all patients. Discussion: No statistically significant cortisol depressive effects of the benzodiazepines were seen (i). However \u00a3entanyl and morphine caused a dose dependent decline of cortisol into the subnormal range, apparently due to a central depressive effect on ACTH. However due to stress situations (e.g. surgical treatment) ACTH (and cortisol) were able to rise again. Mditionally regarding normal tiC/ 17-OHCS values there was no need for corticoid treatment. To test the hypothesis that LMWH fractions are of potential therapeutic value in thromboembolic diseases, two pilot studies were performed. Nine patients (group 1) (mean age 54\u00b115 years) with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) documented by concordant results of pulmonary angiography and scan were treated with Enoxaparine (ENOX)(Pharmuka laboratories, France) as an IV bolus of 0.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion during the 10 first days and then subcutaneously twice daily for the next 15 days. The dosage of ENOX was adjusted on daily performed anti Xa amidolytic assay in order to maintain an activity between 0.2 and 0.6 IU/ml by reference to the anti-Xa activity achieved with unfractionated heparin in such patients. Thirty patients (group 2) (mean age 57\u00b119 years) requiring anticoagulation for their underlying diseases and at high risk of bleeding (gastrointestinal : 10, abdominal wall : g, neurosurgical : 6, others : 5) received ENOX subcutaneously twice daily with a dosage in order to obtain a peak anti-Xa activity at the 3rd hour between 0.10 and 0.40 IU/ml during 4 to 47 days.

Neither side effects nor bleeding complication occured in either group except in 2 patients of group 2 (mild hemoptysis related to a pulmonary infarction, extension of muscular hematoma related to an accidental overdosage.

The measurement of static pulmonary compliance (Cst) by me ans of pressure-volume (P-V)curves is useful to optimize me chanieal ventilation. A major structural derangement caused by an acute lung injury, and reflected in a lower Cst, may lead to a higher mortality. Our hypothesis is that the Cst is a useful parameter to predict the mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). In order to evaluate the prognostic value of Cst we studied 2| adult patients (mean age 60 yr) with ARF due to a primary pulmonary injury.

We studied the sensibility (SE) and specificity (SP) of Cst in order to define the ability of such a test to distinguish patients who died from those who survived for a Cst value ~ 40 ml/cmH20. We calculated the maximum and minimum limits of SE and SP by means of Fisher's exact test for a confidence interval ~ 95%.The calculation of the predictive value of Cst to predict the mortality consisted in the direct application of Bayes'theorem.

Since abnormalities of chest x ray in ARDS are often taken as indicators of severity and clinical course it is nescessary to verify their value by correlation to non morphologic parameters. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively investigated the patients admitted to our internal ICU from april I sl 1982 to april 30 ~'' 1985. 23 (= 2%) patients with a mean age of #5 (19 -71) years, developed an ARDS. The diagnosis was confirmed by clinical data and criteria of gas exchange disturbances. Serial chest x rays of each patient taken in an 2# hour interval, were examined without knowledge of patient information. Radiographic findings of ARDS, divided in a five grade classification recommended by Rommelsheim et al. 1979, were related to corresponding parameters of respiratory status. Results: 74% of the patlents showed first radiographic abnormalities within two days after clinical onset of ARDS. The mean latency period was 1.6 days. There was an evident dependance of classified radiographic features to s/multane.ously measured data of pulmonary gas exchange (Fi Oz, Qs/(~t). Parameters of lung mechanics as total static comphance (compl. _ _), max. endispiratory pressure (p \u2022 ), l:OT .... ins and to a less degree max. minute ventilation (V~) also corr[Psponded with morphologic stages. While radio~'raphic abnormalities in survzvors were maximally classified as stage No. 4 (mean stage 2.7), fatal outcome was represented by stage No. z~ or No. 5 with no exception (mean stage 4.2). Discussion: The data document that in ARDS characteristic radiologic patterns of pulmonary damage appear with short latency after clinical onset of respiratory failure. X ray stages show a close relanonship to simultaneous disturbances of gas exchange and lung mechanics and seperate between survivors and non-survivors. Therefore chest radiography is of great value in the diagnosis and course estimation of ARDS.

Such an oxidative production can be partly inhibited by physiologic antioxydants : vitamin E (vit E) and the related selenium (So) dependent glutathion peroxydase system. The aim of this study was to determine plasma vit E and Se levels in patients suffering from ARDS. Eleven ARDS patients (26 -65 years old) : group I submitted to mechanical ventilation (MV) with Fi02 = 0.5 to 0.6 with or without positive end expiratory pressure were studied. Two control groups were simultaneously analysed. Group II : seven heathly subjects (31 -54 years old) without lung disease , hreathing room air and group III : four comatose patients (21 -62 years old) without lung disease, before and 12 hours after submission to MVwith Fi02 = 0.5 in order to determine the potential deleterious effect of high oxygen delivery. Mean vit E plasma level in heathly subjects (group II : m \u00b1 sem) was : n = 7. 11.45 \u00b1 0.55 mg.l -I and in group III, before 10.62 \u00b1 0.65 mg.l -I and with MV 10.30 \u00b1 0.58 mg.l-l. In group I vit E plasma level was significantly reduced 4.59 \u00b1 0.55 mg.l-I (p<O.OOl) versus group II and IIl.

In two patients in group I serial measurements performed every 12 hours indicated a progressive decrease in vit E plasma level associated with an important gazometric worsening of ARDS. We concluded that i) ARDS was associated with significant low vit E and Se plasma levels, it) The mechanism of this deficiency was probably a vit E and Se consumption during excessive lipid peroxydation, iii) high oxygen concentrations did not affect vit E and Se plasma levels, iv) The potential benefit of vie E and Se administration during ARDS remains to be determine. Recently, the role of activated leukocytes in the oxygen radicals-mediated endothelial cell damage has been evidenced. In this context, lipid peroxidation of membrane phospholipids seems to play a central role, leading to architectural destructuration, to the inactivation of membrane-bound enzymes and to the production of hydroperoxide and other stable compounds, such as malonildialdehyde (MDA).",

Bedside balloon occlusion pulmonary angiography (BOPA) using flow-directed Swan-Ganz pulmonary catheters is a useful technique to study the pulmonary vascular bed in critically ill patients and particularly on patients with Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). With the aim to confirm the published data by several authors we reviewed the EOPA performed with the teehnzque described by Greene, in 30 prospectively studied patients admitted in our ICU in a three-year period with ARDS of diverse etiologies. All patients received cathecolamines. The overall mortality was 70% ( 21 patients). BOPA detected pulmonary artery filling defects (PAFD) in the 90% of the cases (27 patients) and they were classified as: thrombi (55%), decreased background vascularity (85%) and vessel amputations (100%). We did not find statistically significant differences between the normal and abnormal BOPA groups of patients when we compared the values of highest Fi02, level of PEEP, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). None statiscally significant difference was found among the different groups of patients with absent, moderate or severe PAFD. Only when we compared the degree of pulmonary abnormalities seen on chest X-ray (CXR) and the BOPA groups, we found that the mortality in patients with moderate PAFD and patchy air space consolidation (50%) was lower than in patients with moderate PAFD and extensive air space consolidation (87%). In four patients the BOPA diagnosed thrombi in large pulmonary vesels and were treated with high streptokinase (SK) dosage schedule. After the end of SK treatment continuous improvement of the PaO 2 value, intrapulmenary shunt, PVR, PAP and CXR was observed. The BOPA performed 24 hours after the end of SK treatment showed disappearance of the thrombl in all cases. In summary, we think that the BOPA is a useful technique to monitor the changes in the pulmonary vascular bed in ARDS. Myasthenic patients requiring surgery may need postoperative respiratory support, depending on the stage and duration of the disease.Daring the past 3-year period, 31 patients with myathenia Gravis in 0sserman classification groups 2B, 3, and 4, underwent surgery, mostly for transsternal thymectomy, and were subsequently admitted in the Intensive Cars Unit.In l& patients the endotracheal tube was removed after six hours, but 2 patients had to be reintubated and mechanically ventilated. 17 patients needed ventilatory support for a period of 9 to 60 days. We correlated the duration of the disease, dosage of medication required preoperatively, Osserman classification, duration of surgery, and preexisting respiratory pathology to the type of respiratory support required, and the duration of stay in the Intensive Care Unit. The probability of complications, and the criteria of prognosis for such patients were established, according to our experience.",

A potential disadvantage is that there zs no separation between inspiratory and expiratory gas flows, lherefore a rebreathing into the inspiratory limb, dependent on fresh gas flow and expiratory flow rate can occur. For evaluating the amount of rebreathing ten healthy volunteers breathed via a close fitting face mask High-Flow CPAP (0, 5, 10 on H~O) with different fresh gas flows of 15, 30 and 50 I/rain. Inspiratory, expiratory flow and a% concentration were measured at the face mask, in a distance of 50 an in the reservoir bag of 100 on fron the face mask.

This contradiction might be explained by any or some of the following reasons: a) the increase of lung compliance due to PEEP impr~ yes the performance of diafragmatic contraction and balances fully the geometric disadvantage; b) the elevation of alveolar pressure due to PEEP raises the pulmonary afferent refflexes which increases central ventilatory driving; c) the increase in lung volume due to PEEP might not reach sufficient level to modify the diafragmatic configuration.

As an alternative therapy intrapulmonary thrca~olysis is in force. It is unknown if complete dissolution of the thrc~bembolus is possible or if spreading of mic~li into the pulmonary capillaries can occur. Therefore we studied 26 pts. surgically treated by embolectc~ny and/or partial occlusion of the inferior caval vein following massive and/or repetitive micro-emboli~n lately postoperatively (17 after massive thromboembolism, 6 with consecutive CS and 9 after repetitive microe~oolism~ Besides lungfunctional parameters for special CO-diffusion capacity (DCO) (differentiated in a membrane (DM) and vascular (VC) component, following descriptions of ROUGHTON and FORSTER) we measured pulmonary artery pressurel (PAP) at rest and at exercise. Pts. after repetitive emboli~n showed considerably higher diminution of DCO (31%) than those after single massive e~bolic event (15 %) even concomitant by CS (10 %). Repetitive embolism lowered VC by 21%. Only slight decrease of DM (I 6 %) was found after CS. The mean PAP was elevated at rest (40 %) and exercise (30 %) in pts. with repetitive embolism. Pts. after es~0olectc~y (massive embolism)showed normal PAP. Consecutive CS lead to slightly elevated PAP at exercise. Our results show that pulmonary embolectcrmy may prevent any disturbance of DCO or hemodynamics postoperatively even in case of CS prior to surgical intervention. The damage of vascular integrity (=VC) as well as elevated PAP after repetitive embolism allow the hypothesis that possible distribution of microernboli induced by thrc~olysis may lead to similar damage. Nocturnal bradycardias, heart blocks, and asystoles up to 17s are among the predominant cardiac findings in patients with sleep apnea (SA). As parameters from the long-term ECG could contribute to an early diagnosis of SA, we compared the nocturnal heart rate behavior in 2 groups of patlents who had no relevant cardiovascular results and underwent ECG recordings from late afternoon to the next morn:ng. Group I (12 pts.) had pathologically increased SA (29.4 episodes/h, range 16.1-58.2). Group II had physiologically normal SA (1.7 episodes/h, range 0-4).

Mean systolic blood pressure in the SA-group was higher than in the control group (145.4, range 110-220 mmHg as compared to 133.8, range 120-155 mmHg), and mean diastolic blood pressure with 89.6 versus 86.1 mmHg.

Bradycardia <30 bpm was only recorded in the one pat:ent with most severe SA, and heart rates below 40bpm were found in 3 pts. in Group I, and 6 in Group II. Also, the asymptomatic pts. in Group II spent more time in phases with low heart rate than the SA-pts., who, however, exhibited short periods of bradycardia alternating with bursts of heart rate. This oattern should make suspicious of SA. We therefore investigated short-term BP behavior during recurrent apneic episodes with intermittent hyperpnea, which is the common picture in patients with SA. 17 men, mean age 50.7 years (34-65), mean overweight 132 (104-171) in % of normal weight according to arcca, underwent polysomnographic recordings. Apnea and hypopnea activity (AH -activity) was established by means of inductive plethysmography and nasal thermistor.",

            "text": "For the evaluation of the data, we used a gliding calculation of BP mean values over periods of 10min each. During normopnea, variations in mean arterial BP amounted to 15.3 (9-25) mmHg, during pronounced AH-activity to 39.4 (17-74) mmHg (p < 0.01). The amplitude of BP variation correlated positively with the duration of the AH-episodes (p < 0.01), the time lag between the termination of the episodes and the corresponding BP maximum negatively (p < 0,01), We conclude that hemodynamic variation over the course of the night is determined by the frequency as well as the duration of the apneic episodes. In cases of severe apnea, highly critical BP variation is frequently observed. Specific Compliance (Cs), defined as the ratio of Total Static Lung Compliance and FRC, should reflect the intrinsic elastic behavior of the lung structures, independent from the lung volume at which compliance is measured. We measured FRC by a helium dilution method and we computed the compliance of the total respiratory system as the ratio ~ P/~ V at lO ml kg I inflation. Cs was then computed in 9 healthy subjects and in 37 patients with acute respiratory failure. cmH20-i 1 -I) was 24.3 + 4.3 in healthy subjects and Cs (ml 42.6 ~ 19 in ARF patients (mean +l SD). This finding contradicts the hypotesis of progressive fibrosis in ARF. We then hypotize that the increase of Cs in ARF patients could indicate a progressive \"slaking\" of the pulmonary structures undergoing mechanical ventilation. If so, the \"slaking\" should be function of the amount of pressure delivered to the healthy regions of the ARF lung and of the lenght of time in which such pressure is applied. Cs, in fact, resulted positively correlated with the product of the hours in mechanical ventilation and the average PEEP applied during those hours. The pathological decrease in cardiac output (QT) is one of the causes of the fall in mixed venous PO2. During the acute phase of pulmonary embolism (P.E.), it has been shown that, for a given (ZA/Q ratio distribution, the widening in D(A-a)O2 and the severity of hypoxemia is due to this desaturation(I). The aim of this work is to estimate the (2T adjustement of that hypoxemia by giving a hyperoxic mixture to g patients spontaneously breathing at the acute phase of P.E. proved by pulmonary angiography. The results of the right catbeterisation and ol the multiple inert gas technique are compared during breathing room air and byperoxic mixture (rIo2 = 0,#0). Mean PaO2 rises from 61,5 to 120 mmHg and QT during breathing air (4,3 \u00b1 0,9 l.min -1) falls by 0,5 l.min -1 during breathing oxygen (p < 0,02). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreases (p <0,02) and pulmonary vascular resistances are the same. The \u00a2/A/Q ratio distributions remain unchanged. In conclusion, by normalizing hypoxemia QT is decreased even lor patients suffering from low cardiac output during breathing air. These results suggest that an adaptative response of the right heart is immediately induced by hypoxemia at the acute phase of P.E. although there is a reduced pulmonary vascular bed with usually an increase in pulmonary vascular resistances. This cardiac adjustement tend to limit the fall in mixed venous PO2 and thus the severity ol hypoxemia.Furthermore, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction does not seem to be present at this phase of P.E. 1983 ).With standard method RS volume variation is estimated by measuring volumes of introduced and exhaled gas.The equivalence of these parameters during such a slow manoeuvre has recently been questioned(Gattinoni and coll.1985):probably a net loss of volume takes place because of alveolar gas exchange.We developed a simple method for correction of the curve,based on airway occlusion after inflation and recording of Paw during 30 sec of inspiratory apnoea.During this period a linear decli ne of Paw is observed.The slope value allows calculation of pressure values expected for the RS as a closed system,by correction of pressure on a standard curve previously obtained.The inspirator~ PV curve was studied in I0 patients using 02flow-rates(V)of 1,5 and 3 I/min;standard curves were traced,as well as curves obtained by BTPS correction plus correction for apnoea pressure decline. A quantitative estimate of the recruitment phenomenon could improve both the understanding and the management of ARDS (e.g. in selecting PEEP). We devised a mathematical model of the static V/P curve that takes recruitment into account. The model is based on -e) an \"open\" (at P=0) compartment, for which the exponential relationship is proposed: dV/dP=CPL (Vas-Vp) where: CPL= initial compliance, Vas= asymptotic volume reached by the compartment at P ~,Vp=volume of the compartment at pressure P. b) a \"recruitable\" compartment, made up of a population of units, whose opening pressure is normally distributed around a mean opening pressure (PR) with a standard deviation SDPR. Its cumulative asymptotic volume (at poe) is called VR (reeruitable volume). For each unit, once the opening pressure has been reached, equation a) applies, hence affecting an incremental change in Vas. By integration, the relationship between volume and pressure of the system becomes:Vp=Vas+VH(f(PR,SDPR))(l-e [CPL \"]?))in which f(PR,SDPR)",

The aim of this investigation is to validate an easy technique,only used in animal experimentation (i).

A mass spectromete r (MS-2;O~4EDA) was used to analyze the concentrations of -gases,and these were displayed in a x-y recorder. Changes of VD/VT are generally believed to inform quantitatively about alterations of alveolar dead space ventilation. This is based on the ass~mlotion that in an individual patient anatcmical dead space (series dead space) does not change significantly. We demonstrate in a ventilated patient during a severe attack of acute bronchospa~ns that this assumption does not hold true. During the attack gas exchange was inioaired and improved considerably during successful treatment. VD/VT was within normal limits and r~nained constant. However, the detailed analysis of expired CO We conclude that VD/VT does not give the information generally expected. Series dead space, alveolar efficiency for CO2 elimination (alv.eff-C02) and mean alveolar CO 2 concentration provide mere specific information. All three are available at the bedside to describe gas exchange. Underlying mechanisms will be discussed. In an respiratory I~ an automated eultipatie~ monitoring system has been developed.

Methods : Patients with P.A. were placed in lateral decubitus (L.D.) with the lung atelectasied in supine position during 2 hours, two at four times daily. The effects of treatment was appreciated on standard pulmonary radiography by countering signs of P.A. after the first L.D., after the first day, after the fourth day. Material : 15 patients ( 59 , I0~) were treated for 19 atelectasis. P.A. occured 2 times in 4 patients with a delay of more than 10 days. The average number of signs was 6,8 (~ 1,3) initially. Afte T the first two hours of D.L., it decre@sed to 3-~ (~ 1,5). After the first day, it was 2-~ (: 1,6). The fourth day 1,3 signs were presents. In 17 cases P.A. reverses without complications in four days. In 2 cases, six days were necessary. In one case, D.L. failed but with only once a day L.D.. Abdominal pain is known as an infrequent symptom of pulmonary embolism (PE). We observed 4 pts. with PE presenting as \"acute surgical abdomen\" (2 men, 2 women, age 71-84a). They all had a history of cardiopulmonary disease. 2 pts. were admitted with signs of pulmonary infarction (PI) and were treated with heparin, but not in therapeutic doses. After some days they developed acute abdominal pain and laparatemy was done. No pathologic findings were detected. One pt. died on the operation day, the other survived. The other 2 pts. were admitted because of upper abdominal pain and vomiting. They died unexpectedly after 11 and 15 days respectively. At autopsy recurrent PE and PI of the basal parts of the lung were found, the abdomen was unconspioious in all 3 cases. In the surviving pt. repeated scintigrafic studies revealed recurrent PE as the cause of abdominal pain. All pts. had right heart strain~, in the ECG and elevated levels of SGOT, SGPT, LDH and alk. Phesphatase. On the chest-X-ray they showed signs of PE. Abdominal pain in PE emerges presumably due to irritation of the diaphfagmati~ pleura and due to distension of the liver capsule in pts. with right heart failure. Conclusion: I. In pts. presenting with obscure abdominal pain, PE must be considered as a differential diagnosis (especially when there are underlying eardiopulmonary diseases). 2. Abdominal pain in apt. with known PE cand be a sign of recurrent PE.

IPPB is advocated on the assumption that increased driving pressure would propel aerosolized m~dication further into the airway and deposit Jt so that the greatest brenchodilatations and liquifaction of secretions would occur .Ventilatory changes under IPPB were measured in 15 severe asthmatic patients treated for a mean duration of 1.6 -+ 0.91 days . The effectiveness of this line of treai~ent proved to be successful in 13 patients (86.7%) and mechanical ventilation was applied to the other to patients .

In a 6-years period we treated 6] patients with severe status asthmaticus in our intensive care unit. The course of these patients were analysed retrospectively. The case material was strongly selected: 45 patients (74 %) were admitted primarily intubated and mechanically ventilated from other hospitals, our emergency care unit (ECU) or by our emergency ambulance (EA) routinely accompanied by an anesthesiologist; only 16 patients (26 %) did not require mechanical ventilation (MV). In 33 of the patients who received MV (73 %) we used halothane for bronchodilation; 2 patients received halothane only via face mask. 2 out of the total 61 patients died, one of them had primarily been reuscitated at home and had a severe cerebral hypoxia. Halothane treatment often began in the EA or in the ECU (12 resp. 4 patients), the duration was between 0.5 and 66.5 h (median 5.75 h), in 10 cases it exceeded 12 h. Halothane reduced the high airway pressures caused by bronchoconstriction mostly within I hour. The basic routine medical treatment usually included aminophylline, sympathomimetics, corticoids and sedatives (i.v.) and nebulation of secretolytics and sympathomimetics.",

Pulmonary and systemic pressure values, heart rate, cardiac output, body weight and size are entered and the derived data consist of cardiac index (C.I), stroke volume, stroke volume index, systemic and pulmonary resistance indexes,right and left ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI, LVSWI) coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), rate pressure product (RPP) and triple index (TI).

A Basic program written by the authors, calculates clearance values (creatinine, urea), parameters for concentration ability (CH?O, U/P osmol, U/P urea) and tubular reabsorption (FENg) of the kidney and the excretion of electrolytes in a given period of time. The printout of recorded and calculated parameters permits: I. Early identification of incipient renal failure, 2. Differentiation between prerenal failure and oliguric renal failure, 3.

Introduction: The standard method for determining {he hematocrit value is to centrifuge blood samples and measure the packed cell volume; another method is to use the conductivity of whole blood. Both methods show great variation of error due to methodological problems. The purposesof this study are: (I) to observe the relationship between hematocrit values estimated by microhematocrit technique and conductivity, particularly in low hematocrit ranges ('20 volt) ; (2) to examine the effects of changes in ion concentrations. Method: 24 samples of venous or arterial blood were collected from 22 ICU patients with a wide range of blood sodium concentrations (117-174 m~ol/ I). The packed cell volumes were adjusted to final values ranging from 10 to 74 volt by dilution with plasma or resuspensionwith erythrocytes. The analyses were performed in triplicate on each specime~ by (I) centrifugation technique (3,000 rpm for 10 min); (2) simultaneous measurements of sodium, po~ tassium and whole blood conductivity. We used a device with ion selective electrodes and a conductivity circuit in serial connection. Results: The results indicate that hematocrit val* ues of 10 to 70 volt show a non-linear correlatio% to the impedance of whole blood. The relationship is well described by a quadratic function. Discussion: Electrical conductivity in the whole blood is influenced by the number and form of ery ~ throcytes as well as the concentrations of plasma proteins and ions. The present method makes it This program for a personal computer, by name LITCAT, is a retrieval system, designed for the private library of any medical scientist, which helps finding papers and presentations from the own collection quickly and reliably by several criteria of selection, such as author's name, year, journal, keywords, and the combination of these items. Additionally, it types out the references that matched the selection criteria in a numbered list that is automatically in alphabetical order. Any other sorting sytem is also possible to perform, as well as there is the option to give a one-line title to the list. For user's comfort, any function of LITCAT from data input (storage, modification, deletion) to output (selection, print output, screen lists of authors or keywords) is designed in the mask technique to provide a simple and time-saving method. The program also includes a HELP-function to inform the user at any time about the specifications concerning the current screen. In the storage mask, there is sufficient dimensioned space for every important information about the paper. The number of authors or keywords is not limited, just the number of characters in total, and each of these stored items can be used for selection. The format of the keywords is almost free to fit the user's special needs. The access to any program mode is simply function-key guided. In order to elucidate the extent to which the endocrine system and metabolism are influenced by traumatic or s~ptic shock, the time course of various hormonal and metabolic parameters was studied in surgical ICU patients and related to severity scores and outcome.",

            "text": "These results demonstrate that STS is elevated in human septic shock.Whether this abnormality is a simple consequence of septic shock and/or its treatment, or has, any pathophysiological relevance as regards metabolic or hemodynamic disorders remains to be elucidated. There is an excellent correlation between the transcutaneous partial pressure of C02 (PtcC02) and PaC02 in the adult and child except in the case where the cardiac index is severely decreased (CI<l.5 1/min/m2) (Tremper 1980) . The aim of this work is to monitor theAC02 during septic shock (SS) and to compare it to the & C02 observed during cardiogenic shock (CS). Material and methods: the PtcC02 was measured using a Kontron sensor heated to 43\u00b0C and hemodynamie values were monitored with the Edwards 9520 A thermodilution apparatus. The sensor placed on the thoracic skin surface was initially tested on 24 healthy subjects (r=0.95) and then the linear relationship between PaC02 and PtcC02 as measured on the surface of the knee was verified in 9 healthy individuals (r=0.85). The study itself was done on 4 patients (2 males, 2 females with an average age of 69 ~ 15 years) in SS for which : the CI was 3.5 \u00b1 1.4 1/min/m2 and the PVR= 17 ~ 2 IU/m2. We compared these values to those of 4 patients in severe CS (2 males$ 2 females, average age 55 ~ 20 [ears) in whom the CI=l.7 -O.lO i/min/m2 and the PVR=41.2 z ii IU/m2. In order to have sensitive PtcC02 measurements, the skin sensor was placed behind the knee where peripherai vasoconstriction was clearly evident. Results : among the 4 patients in CS, the correlation between PtcC02 versus PaC02 was constantly maintained (PtcC02 =28.5. ~ 4.8 mmHg ; PAC02=29 ~ 5.7 mmHg) and & C02 was never in excess of 2 mmHg. Howewer, in the case of the 4 patients in SS, the PtcC02 was always much higher than the PaC02 (PtcC02=64 ~ ll mmHg ; PAC02=52.7 ~ 8 mmHg) and the AC02 was between 12 and 54 mmHg (& C02=31.2 $ 17 mmHg). Comments : the initial results of this study suggest that : l) there is an importantAC02 during SS which is not found during CS. 2) the&C02 is not correlated with the CI or the PVR which remain normal. 5) During SS, the high A CD2 is due to tissue anoxia. Metomidate (M) as a close relative of etomidate inhibits cortisol (Co) synthesis, too. M is used widely in animal anesthesia. We compared the effects of cortisol substitutibn in M + ketamine (K) anesthetized (2.5/M + 3.0/K mg/kg/h) pigs (average BW 30.2 kg, 3 groups, n = 8, each) during septic shock by live Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The animals were paralyzed with 0.3 mg/kg/h alcuroniumchloride and put on artificial ventilation (Fi02 = 0.33, rest N20). PCWP was well maintained by infusion of 6 % dextran 70. Group C served a~ anesthesia control, group CB received bacteria (2.5\"I0 J organisms until death) only, and group CBC received Co (l mg/kg bolus and O.l mg/kg/h infusion) I h prior to bacteria (like CB). The experiments in group C were terminated at lO hrs, mean survival time of CB was 4 hrs, and of CBC ll.6 hrs. All measured hemodynamic, respiratory, and biochemical variables of C were stable throughout the experiment, despite of complete Co deficiency. In CB there was no detectable Co from the very beginning; total systemic vascular resistance (TSR) started to fall at approximately 1.5 hrs, the progression of which could only be slowed by massive infusion. Pigs of CB died of circulatory failure. Most striking, after Co-substitution in CBC TSR increased and remained significantly higher than in C and CB. CBC exhibited fairly stable hemodynamics; Co was 35 pg/dl at the start of bacteria, and subsequently between 15 (2hrs) and I0 Ng/dl (8hrs). CBC died of pulmonary edema (extravascufar thermal volume 20.1 ml/kg at 8 hrs). Conclusion: Co deficiency in M anesthetized pigs facilitates the development of circulatory shock in the course of Pseudomonas sepsis what does not occur with reconstitution of Co-levels to normal.",

            "text": "Right atrial (RAP) and especially pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) are the common guide parameters used to adjust adequate circulating blood volume (ACBV). We investigated, if intrathoracic blood volume (IVV) may be a better guide for maintaining ACBV i n septic patients. Two groups (8 patients each) of two intensive care units (ICU) were compared. Infusion therapy of ICU l is balanced, whilst a restrictive regimen is performed in ICU 2. IVY -as a side product of lung water measurement with the thermo-dye-technique -is calculated from the femoral artery dye curve (detection with 5 F fiberoptic lung water cath.): CO x MTT, where CO = cardiac output and MTT = mean transit time (dye). RAP and PCWP were measured with usual techniques. The groups were comparable concerning severity of clinically diagnosed sepsis. No difference (unpaired Wilcoxon test, significance p<0.05) between the two groups was found in BW, BSA, PEEP-levels, RAP, PCWP, HR, PVR, and SVR though the mean values of the latter three parameters were higher in patients of ICU 2. Cardiac index with 6.4 I/m 2 (ICU I)/4.6 I/m 2 (ICU 2) and IVV with 36.1 ml/kgBW/24.6 m]/kgBW were significantly different. Moreover, IVY correlated well (12 patients, ICUI\u00f72, 4 had to be excluded because of intra-renal failure) with GFR (r = 0.70) and free water clearance (r = 0.76) . The respective coefficients r for RAP and PCWP were below 0.35. These results demonstrate the suitability of IVV as an accurate indicator of the circulating volume status. IVY obviously is the only parameter being directly coupled to CBV and different between the ICUs. The lower CO of ICU 2 may be explained by the low IVY. It is concluded, that IVY helps establishing ACBV, thereby being useful for the preservation of renal function and in the differential diagnosis between pre-renal and intra-renal failure. It has been demonstrated, that exogenous stress factors lead to an increased O -demand. Recently it has been postulated, that t~e ability of augmenting. O 2-c\u00b0nsumpti\u00b0n (~02) in answer to such increased demand discrimlnates survivors from nonsurvivors. Therefore, ~ -index is supposed to have a great prognostic value on survival rate (I) (Shoemaker, 1985) . The Simplified Acute Physiology Scoring system (SAPS) has appeared to classify patients into groups of increasing probability of death (II) (leGall, 1985) . If ~ -index is inversely related to mortality r~e (I) and mortality rate can be quantified by SAP-Score (II), it could be hypothetized, that ~02-index is also inversely related to SAP-Score (III). The aim of this study was to quantify these three supposed relationships. In 50 artificially ventilated, surgical ICU patients ~ -index was determined individually by continu~s 24 hrs gas exchange measurements. The v -level of survivors was not different from ~e level of nonsnrvivors (p> 0.05). The SAPS-system classified the patients correctly (mean 14, SD + 4) into groups of increasing probability of death. However, v~N 2-index was not related to SAP-Score (R = -0.09)7 It can he concluded, that in our heterogeneous group of patients Vo2-index has no prognostic value on patient's outcome ant that #o2-index is not consistently determined by the extent of organ failure.",

The criteria for inclusion were obvious internal or external hemorrhage, systolic arterial pressure (SAP) ~ 70 mmHg, no head nor rachis injury. 273 AHS were included. 248 patients had tachycardia > 1OO b.p.m, and defined group T. 25 patients had tachycardia ~ 60 b.p.m. 5 patients were unconscious with undetectable SAP, no femoral pulse and defined the group D (dying patients}. But the 20 others were conscious, femoral pulse was present even when SAP was undetectable using sphygmamometric method {9 patients). All of them recovered from bradycardia after fluid loading. The comparison between groups T and B showed that the patients from the group B were youngers and had a more severe and a more rapid hemorrhage. The etiology of AHS in patients from group B were : arterial wound of the limbs (5), hepatic trauma (7) with hepatic veins rupture (3), splenic rupture (4), ectopic pregnancy (3) and hemothorax (I). During 1985, 4 new cases of AHB with paradoxical bradycardia were observed and treated with an antishock trouser (AST). These patients recovered from bradycardia more quickly (p < 0.01) and with less important fluid loading (p < O.01) than those of group B.They all recovered less than 5 min after AST inflation. We suggest that paradoxical bradycardia in AHS denotes a rapid and severe hemorrhage able to induce a high parasympathetic activity without decrease in systemic vascular resistances by streching either left ventricular mecanoreceptors or low pressure cardiopulmonary baroreceptors.

We reviewed the initial hemodynamic parameters in all patients who had a pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheter in our medico-surgical (non-coronary) Department of Intensive Care between January 1984 and September 1985. Uncomplete or technically unsatisfactory hemodynamic evaluations were discarded. A total of 222 adult patients (age 61 \u00b1 11 years) were taken into statistical evaluation. Mechanical ventilation was used in 149 (87 %) patients. Pressures were routinely measured at end-expiration from a paper trace. PG ranged from 14 to -10 mm Hg and was evenly distributed around a peak of 2 mm Hg. PG was between 4 and 0 mm Hg in 121 (55 %) patients and between 6 and -2 mm Hg in 173 (78 %) patients. The PG distribution was less related to age than to history or clinical evidence of left heart failure (LHF) or respiratory failure (RF). Of the 29 patients wich a PG above B mm Hg, 22 had LHF and only 3 RF. Of the 20 patients with a PG below -2 mm Hg, 6 had LHF and 8 RF. PG was widely distributed in patients with circulatory shock or after cardiovascular surgery. In critically ill patients, PG averages only 2 mm Hg and is usually included between 0 and 4 mm Hg. PG exceeds 6 mm Hg in only 13 % and LHF is usually evident in these cases. On the other hand, a PG decrease below -2 mm Hg (in 9 % of patients) can be related to sometimes unrespected right ventricular failure. A traumatic shock injury in sheep ( tibia fracture / crush injury, 2 hr. hemorrhage to 40 mmHg mean arterial pressure (MAP), focal brain injury ) was fol]owed by resuscitation to baseline MAP for 2 hrs. The animals were resuscitated with lactated Ringer's (LR,n:6) or albumin (ALB,n=6). Intracranial pressure (ICP) and hemodynamics were followed. At sacrifice, brain water (BW) was compared to controls (C,n=7). A group of 52 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admitted within 3 hours of onset of acute chest pain was treated with 1,000,000 U of streptokinase in i hour {~ group). 21 patients admitted within 3-6 hours of onset of acute pain served as a control group (C group). In the early phase (48 h) following the AMI there was no difference in the left ventrleular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by means of gated radionuclide ventriculography (sK33_+11 ,c40~-15 ). In the late phase (18 days) the streptokinase treated group showed a larger LVEF (SK52~12 ,C 45--.I 5 p< O.Ol). The dynamic ventriculography (hand -grip test) showed a significant decrease of the LVEF in streptokinase treated patients (SK--|2.89 ,C--2.67 ,p< O.Ol). This might be the consequence of still existing coronary stenosis. The ventrieulography is suggested as a screening method after the streptokinase treatement of AMI.",

To study the influence of hyperosmolality on conduction system of the heart, we raised serum osmolality in5 a~aesthesized cats b~ infusing intravenously the X-ray contrast medium Telebrix-300. Another series of 5 cats got infusions of urea (both the same osmolality 1860 mosm/kg). In the intracardial recordings we could see late potentials after 3-7 min of infusion (2 or 5 ml/min) in all 10 cases. Ventricular arrhyChmia appeared in 8 cases and ventricular tachyeardia in 3 cases. When late potentialsRappeared , osmolality ha4 increased i~ 30~10 % (Telebrix) and 32&12 ~ (urea). Heart rate had decreased in 22~14 % (Telebrix R) and 10~6 % (urea). Q-T interval did not show any changes in respect to heart ra~ A-H interval increased from 59~2 ms to 69~3 ms (Telebrix) and 55~9 ms to 65~I0 ms (urea) . H-V did not change significantly. Sinus recovery time increased. While sodium, potassium and calcium concentration remained nearly constant~ arterial blood pressure fell with Tale-\u2022 R brlx and raised with urea infusion. We suggest, that conduction disturbances by hyperosmotic solutions are caused by an electrical uncoupling effekt, separating cells at the gap junctions , leading to an in-.creasing longitudinal resistance, and not by influencing the action potential. Thus a mechanism is found, explaining the appearance of late, fractionated potentials and arrhythmias in intact heart tissue by conduction block, bringing forth reentry. So an association of cardiac arrhythmia with serum hyper-os~olality implicates the possibility, that arrhythmia might be caused by hyperosmolality and can be a severe threatening for a eg intensive care patient.

Amrinone was injected in different sPgments of the left circumflexe coronary artery via a coronary catheter whlch was variably deeply advanced \"to the arteryls periphery. I mg Amrinone injected over 90 seconds into the coronary artery increases local myocardial force 25 + 12 % and local shortening distance 32 + 19 % in the perfused area, whereas the control area is kept unchanped. Depending on the size of the pharmacologically stimulated area, LVEDP is slightly reduced (max. I mm Ha), LV dp/dt increases up to IB %. Cardiac output is kept unchanged. Heart rate (HR) tends to decrease less than 10 %. When the coronary catheter is advanced to the left curvature of the circumflexe artery a smaller wallsegment is stimulated by the positive inotropic drug. The resulting increase in local contractility has no measurable repercussion on LV dp/dt and LVEDP. In the presented model inotropic drugs can be locally dosed such, that the segmental (clrcumflexearea) contractile force and shortening distance are ~idely changed without acting on the control area (LAD-area) which is not perfused by the agent. LVEDP, LV dp/dt (and BR) are indicators sensitive enough to reflect changes in the dynamics of a wall segment as extended as that which is perfused by the circumF1exe artery. However, changes in the function of a smaller compartment are kept hidden behind the averaging indices of the global ventricular Function. Preoperative left ventricular function variables were evaluated as potential risk factors for per-and early postoperative complications in 196 consecutive patients (pts) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The following criteria of impaired left ventrlcular function (LVF) were considered : EFt40%, LVEDP (LV-e~d-diastolic pressure)~ ~5 mmHg, LV-EDV (end-dlastolJc volume)~> 120 ml/m2 and LV-ESV (end-systolic volume)~60 ml/m2. 56 pts had no abnormal crlter~a and [30 pts had at least 1 criteria (67), 2 criteria (33), 3 criteria (]7) and 4 criteria (13). There are no differences between pts with normal (N) and abnormal (AN) LVP conce[ning age, sexe, weight and 3 vessels disease (57 and 63%), but preoperative infarction (I) rate was greater in AN (71.6%) than in N (39.6%)(p~0.04) and bronchitis (CPOD) N (25%), AN (49%). During the early postoperative course, N and AN dlfferentiated significantly in 1-need for inotroplc therapy (ii vs 30%, p<0.05) 2-1ntra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)(0 vs 13% wlth 3 criteria (p~O.O06) and 23% with 4 criteria ; p < 8.081), 3-arrhythmlas (20 and 40% respectively (p<O.O02) and 4-stay in ICU (2.3 + 0.8 and 3.9 + 2 days, p<0.Ol). Duration in hospital stay, mortal~ty (0 and 1 pts), and perioperatlve infarction rate was not slg~iflcantly different. During a mean follow-up of 2 years, N a~d AN did Dot show a marked difference in recurrent angina pectorls and mortali ty. Rupture of an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta (RAAA) is a life threathening event. Per-and postoperative mortality is high, but with aggressive treatment some poor risk patients can be saved. We report on 21 consecutive patients (20 men and 1 woman) operated for RAAA between January 1st 1984 and November 1st 1985. The mean age was 70 i 9 yrs with 11 patients over 70 yrs old. No patient below the age of 70 died. Patients over 70 yrs old had a mortality of 63 % : 4 patients died during the operation and 3 others in the intensive care unit (ICU) 6 to 48 hrs after the operation. The surviving patients were extubated 10 i 7.5 hrs after admission and left the ICU after 2 \u00b1 2 days. The postoperative course was uneventful in 8 patients. 4 patients had pulmonary complications, 2 patients transient renal insufficiency and cardiac problems. In order to determine if clinical conditions other than age over 70 influence the outcome we tabulated these according to survivors and non survivors (table). We conclude that although patients with RAAA are known to be poor risk patients their immediate postoperative course is often uncomplicated and therefore justifies aggressive surgical management and postoperative care, especially in patients below 70 yrs old. In order to study the possible relation between patients outcome and their precedence, once admitted %o a general ICU~ we have studied 500 consecutive admissions to our polivalen% unit. Severity of illness by means of simplified APACHE system and therapeutic effort according to qualitative transformation of TISS scerings, were studied and correlated to survival rates. patients were classified after their precedence, in four g~oups: those coming from conventional Hospital wards, those admitted from the surgical theatre, those admitted through the emergency department and those being moved from another center. Results show higher severity scores in patients coming from other centers and from Hospital wards~ in front of postsurgery or emergency cases (p(O.OO1). That severity is well correlated to the therapeutic effort required for those cases (p< 0.0005, when comparing intensive treatment in front of active monitoring). Mortality rates were also significantly higher in the same both groups of patients~ mainly when considering the first 24 hours of stay mortality, which highest rate was present in the group cemin from Hospital wrds (p(0.OO1). We conclude that patients outcome is in somehow related to their precedence, and that a different organization of ICU activity must be stablished in order to diminish higher mortalities in already hospitalized patients.",

Palma de Mallorca.Spain. Multiorganic failure(~0F)is a condition appearing in critical care patients as a consequence of improving attendance facilities,and usually associated to a poor prognosis. In order to study such aspects, according to the moment of onset of MOF, 500 consecutive patients have been stu-died~ and MOF accepted if flutes or more acute system failures were simultaneously present.Severity of illness was evaluated at the admission and 24 hours later,according to simplified APACHE system, and intensity of treatment was also considered~ and mortality after a complete hospitalary stay analyzed. Results: Tl~ree groups of patients could be differentiatsg :those with MOF present at their admission (initial ~OF, 66 cas~s);those presenting MOF after the first 24 hours ef stay (late MOF, 32 cases) and those in which NOP appeared or was manteined after the first 24 hours (secuential MOF~ 91 cases). Only in 7 cases, initial MOF healed after 24 hours. Severity of illness in NOF patients was higher than in patients without MOF (p (O.05),but no significant differences appeared among the three modalities of MOF. Intensity of treatment was not diferential amongst M0F cases, but it was when compared to the rest of the cases (p\u2022O.O1). Same findings were stablished when mortality ~as analyzed (p < 0.O1). We do conclude: sverity of illness and mortality in MOF do net depend on the moment of onset~ but to the fact of MOF itself. Qualitative transformation of TISS scorings in assistance levels (conventional ward treatment~ active monitoring and intensive treatment),as a measure of therapeutic effort, is a good complement of severity of illness evaluation, when describing critically ill patients populations, but idiosyncrasy and particular characteristics of each Hospital have to be taken on account. In order to review the influence of such considerations on groups of patients description, we ~ave studied 500 consecutive admissions to our multidisciplinary ICU. Severity of illness has been evaluated according to simplified APAC~ system, and therapeutic effort has been correlated to mortality. Assistance levels have been applied after the initial description (1) and our own modification to adapt them to our Hospital (2) . Results show that both systems have a good correlation with mortality (p(0.OO1) and with severity of illnesm (p(O.OO1). Our modification is associated to higher levels of severity of illness, but no significant differences are found (pNS). Nevertheless, the ability of description for the same population of patients with the initial description and our modification is defined by a ratio of intensive treatment/active monitoring of 1.32 for the former and 0.9 for the later (p,O.OO1). (Croups 1 and 2 respectively). W~ conclude that each Hospital characteristics have %o he in account for results evaluation, but generaI standards have to be clearly defined when different groups of patients have to be compared. In achieving a systematic evaluation of the effect of therapeutic measures in the treatment of polytraumatized patients, a practical classification as to the overall severity of injury is essential. For this purpose, the Injury Severity Score (ISS), a classification system based on anatomical criteria, has prooved itself very suitable. Practical application of the ISS is presented using various examples. In correlating overall severity of injury according to the ISS -system of l.Oq7 polytraumatized patients with clinical course and outcome, ISS classification was found to be closely related to total length of treatment, duration of artificial ventilation, number of blood units necessary during primary care period, and outcome of patients. ISS does not consider the influence of patient age on the overall prognosis. The results indicate that the Injury Severity Score is suitable when evaluating a larger patients collective comparatively and in verifying the results obtained. Statements as to the prognosis of the individual patients can, of course, not be made.",

During one year, the incidence and symptoms of secondary pancreatitis in operative intensivecare patients was investigated. In 81% of all patients who required intensive care for more than 4 days, lipasemia of over 150 U/I occurred. In as many as 58% of all patients, lipase increase exceeded 450 U/I. There was no difference between abdominal, neurosurgical and traumatologieal patients. By comparing different biochemical methods it could be verified that the measured lipase levels were specifie for the pancreas. More than 75% of the patients with increased lipase levels suffered from gastric and intestinal atony, icterus and blood acidosis in the course of their illness. The increase of alcaline phosphatase and alphaamylase in the serum was regularly accompanied by a serum lipase increase. Sonography of the upper abdomen in cases of persistent lipase increase of more than 10OO U/I (n=25) showed normal pancreas findings in 84% of the examined cases. However, at autopsy, 80% of the cases showed pathological pancreas findings. It is likely that a pancreas affection lacking the typical symptoms of acute panereatitis and which is difficult to detect by sonography was induced during intensive medical treatment. Despite of recent advances in evaluation end non operative treatment, mortality in A.N.P. remains over 5D%.An original operative management is presented : at operation, debridment o? necrotic tissue, biliary drainage and jejunostomy are performed , drainage of necrotic collections is achieved by gauze packings ?or the first IS post-oI:erative days, and by silicone tubes ?or the 2B following days. Continuous enteral nutrition is undertaken via the jejunostomy and provides 50go kCal and 2,Bg of protein per kilo BW and per day. S4 patients with A.N.P. were managed in the surgical I.D.U. following these principles. 38 men and 16 women, mean age 46, 60% being referred from other centers. RANSON's score was ranging from B to 11 [mean ?,S). Dverall mortality was 18%. Enteral nutrition via the jejunostomy induced no relapse of pancremtitis and was associated with a decrease in Insulin requirements as compared to TPN. The large drainaEe shafts created by the technique appeared to achieve an e?ficent elimination of toxic ?luids and necrotic debris throughout the active phase of the disease. Upper gastrointestinal lesions are commonly accepted as life-threatening complication in intensive care of polytraumatized patients. In more than 1.600 patients treated in our ICU over a 13 year period, not one case of perforating ulcer was recorded. The second form of manifestation of upper GIT lesion, acute hemorrhage, was studied retrospectively in 137, prospectively in 246 polytraumatized patients. Therapeutic schedule consisted in standardized intensive care including gastric emptying and application of local antacids. Significant upper GIT bleeding occured in 2 patients out of 383 (0.5%); both suffered from severe multiorgan insufficiency and at the time of bleeding were in obvious prefinal state. In our opinion, upper GIT hemorrhage has to be considered part of multiorgan failure. Thus, therapeutical approach should deal with the preceeding factors causing multiorgan failure such as shock or septic state. Therfore, in our experience the need of general pharmacologic prophylaxis in intensive care of polytraumatized patients should not remain undoubted. Adverse reactions after homologous blood transfu= sion as well as defiency of bank blood stress the importance of blood conservation during and after surgery. METHODS: 44 patients scheduled for hemihepatecto= my or isolated perfusion of the liver were ran= domly devided into two groups: group I (n=22) had no blood withdrawn and received no autologous blood; group II underwent acute normovolaemic haemodilution by removing autologous blood imme= diately before the onset of operation (15 mm/kg) and simultaneous volume replacement using 6% hy= droxyaethyl starch (0,7/450).

Critically ill patients, especially during ventilator therapy (VT), total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and septic episodes are at high risk for the formation of stress ulcers and upper GIT-bleedin9. Prophylactic use of H2-antagonists has been widely accepted, especially when antacids are con. traindicated. However, with early used H2-antagonists, especially cimetidine the failure rate as well as a number of side effects were unacceptable high. The aim of the present study was to compare safety and effectiveness of the two H2-antagonists famotidine and ranitidine. Methods: Forty critically ill patients on VT and TPN were randomly divided into two groups. When the pH of gastric secretions was below 3,0, group A patients received ranitidine (50 mg i.v. 8-hourly) and group B patients received famotidine (10 mg i.v. 8-hourly). pH of gastric secretions was measured 2-hourly during 48 to 168 hours. Possible side effects and the occurrence of upper GIT-bleeding were evaluated daily by clinical-and laboratory analysis. Two subsequent pH-values below 3.0 were considered to indicate a failure. Results: 232 of 1593 measured pH-values (14,6%) were below 4.0. For the famotidine-group the risk of low pH-values (8,9%) was significantly less than for the ranitidine-group (21,9%) (p 0,01). Also, the mean pH-values in group A patients (ranitidine, mean pH 4,77) were significantly lower (p 0,01) than those in group B patients (famotidine, mean pH 5,95). The difference in mean pH and in the range was also confirmed by Wilcoxon's ranksum test (s = 0,95). Abstract low pH-values occured independent of daytime and last drug administration. There were 3 failures and I GITbleeding in group A patients compared to I failure in group B. Side effects were infrequently and transient. Conclutions: Both drugs exhibited a good risk-benefit ratio. Famotidine was more effective than ranitidine. 8 hepatic synthetized plasma proteins were studied pre-operatively and at 24 hours intervals during 7 days after surgery in 12 cirrhotic patients (C) who underwent an emergency surgical procedure for bleeding esophageal varlces and compared with a group of patients after gene ral surgery (S) as\" control.",

Despite early percutaneous peritoneal dialysis (PPD), patients (pts) with severe acute necrotic hemorrhagic pancreatltis (ANHP,Ranson score~7) still have poor prognosis (mortallty:54%)(1). In order to avoid early lethal cardiorespiratory failure, thoracic duct drainage (TDD) is also proposed to eliminate massive resorption of many toxic substances liberated by the diseased pancreas. We recently treated 2 pts admitted during the first ~2 hours of onset of symptomatology (Table) . Despite PPD, in both cases, patlent I developped\"shock lung\" on day 2 and patient 2 remained in cardiovascular unstabillty (CVU) needing optimal volume loading and amines support. TDD was performed in both cases from day 2 to day 6 : brown lymph fluid, rich in amylase, was initially drained. (3) ~hoek lung\" and CVU were corrected respectively on day 7 and 6.Long term evolution was favorable in both cases without surgery. Patient i suffered from insulin dependant dia~ betes and an asymptomatic pseudocyst developped in patient 2. It is suggested that in severe ANHP, PPD associated with TDD might avoid early death due to resorption of toxic substanes. Acustic and somatosensory evoked potentials (AEP, SEP) are used to monitor cerebral funktion of comatose and neurosurgical patients.Systematic descriptionof SEP and AEP changes produced by sedativa and analgetics is needed to extract drug effects from neurological changes. In 36 healthy adults ( 20 to 40 years old )the changes in SEP (early and middle latency components), brainstem acustic evoked potentials (BAEP) and middle latency AEP produced by medication with Diazepam 0.15 mg/kg, Pethidine Img/kg and Midazolam 5mg i.v. were examined. BAEP were uneffecte~ by the medication.Middle latency components,however,showed prolonged latencies. The amplitudes were also altered dependent from the sedative effect. In the first phase(10 minutes) 50% of the patients had increased amplitudes whichoften decreased in the later phase. Initially the amplitudes of early and middle latency SEP components were accentuated. The latencies of the first three waves were nearly unchanged,the increase of latency was progressively higher for the following Intensive therapy for patients in traumatic coma can be guided by continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) and blood pressure (BP) as well as calculation of derived values such as cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Both for clinical and research purposes these variables are often continuously recorded, conventionally using paper charts on which events are written by the staff. Retrospective analysis of such records involves time-consuming, relatively inaccurate measurements and calculations. We have devised a monitoring system based on the ACT SYRIUS I microcomputer and a 7-channel multi-purpose amplifier system (Gaeltec Research). This allows real time analogue display of central venous pressure (CVP), ICP, BP and the cerebral function monitor.",

Universit~t MOnster Introduction: As in neurosurgieal patients, autoregulation of cerebral blood flow {CBF) is often lost, a sudden increase in bioo8 pressure may lead to an increase in CBF and to a damage of the blood brain barrier with consequent cerebral edema. Previous animal studies indicated that Urapidil, a postsynaptlc o4,-adrenoceptor antagonist, does not increase CBP and intraeranlal pressure (ICP). This study evaluates the effect of Urapidil and blood pressure and ICP in patients undergoing craniotomy for intracerebral tumors. Methods: Eight patients were studied. Systollc, diastolic and mean arterlal systemic pressures {SAP,DAP.MAP). heart rate (HR) and ICP (inbraventrlcular catheter) were continuously recorded. When hypertensive reactions (increases in SAP of more than 25 mmHg) oecured in spite of a good level of anaesthesia. Urapidil was administered i.v. in a dose sufficient to treat this hypertension. Oata are mean + SD. In a previous study ( I ) early onset pneumonia (EOP, diagnosed within 4 dags of admission) was found to he clinically relevant, accounting far >589~ of all diagnosed pneumonias. The early onset, due probablg to aspiration in a limited period at the acute onset of ill hess, could represent a rationale for anti microbial prophylaxis, widelg and empirically used in current praxis. To verify this hypothesi~ a multicentre randomized clinical trial (Q<=O.05, 13=0.20) was carried out in 25 ICUs over a 4 months period in 1984 Patients with pro-established indication for prophylaxis were excluded as well as patients with ICU stay < 48h, pulmonarg infection on admission or terminal illness. Clinical and radialogical criteria were requested for diagnosis (I). Included patients (570) were randomized in three subsets: 195 with no prophylaxis, 196 with 4 x 2M penicillin G (narrow spectrum, not active against Gram negatives), 18! with 3 x 2g cefoxitin (broad spectrum).-Patients' clinical data and rink factors were found not to be statisticaUy different among prophylactic regimens. The data (table) show no difference in the incidence of pneumonia or EOP in the three groups. The lack of a rationale for aatimicrobial ua\u00a2 ia preventing pulmonary infections allows avoidance of empirical prophylaxis. This policy (no prophylaxis) doesn't enhance infectious complications, while should decrease the risk of bacterial selection. In a prospective randomized study the effects of locally administered antimicrobials on colonization and pulmonary infection were investigated in 39 acutely ill patients with long-term ventilatory support(> 6 days). 19 patients received at 6-hour intervals 50 mg of polymyxin B and 80 mg of gentamicin into nose, oropharynx and stomach as well as 300 mg of amphotericin B in the oropharynx only. 20 patients served as controls.",

Conclusion: The program is very easy to use and has been especially helpful in dosage adjustment caused by changes in the patients\" clinical parameters. The program is very illustrative. From animal experiments pulmonary tissue is known to accumulate fentanyl (F) considerably. Chemically related to F, the same might be true for alfentanil (A) . W e studied the pulmonary kinetics of F in 5 patients and of A in 6 patients quantitatively. After bolus injection of a mixture of F or A and indocyanine green, first pass uptake was calculated from central blood volume and the mean of F and A concentrations in arterial blood during mean transit time. The subsequent release was calculated from arterio-mixed venous concentration differences. During first pass, 43-86.9% of the F dose applied, and 35.9-79.8% of A were accumulated by human lung. The declining arterio-mixed venous F concentration differences could be described by two-term exponential equations. 14 min after injection, the lungs of 3 pat. still contained 15-40% of the F dose injected. A was released initially with about the same velocity as was F. 2 min after injection however, A release from the lung could hardly be detected, though the pulmonary tissue still contained up to 50% of the dose injected. Uptake and subsequent release of a considerable part of the dose injected by tissues situated between site of administration and site of action influences intensity and duration of a drugs effects as well as its kinetics. This is certainly true for F. The intensity of the effects of A will be diminished by pulmonary uptake too. 2 min after injection, pulmonary A kinetics have no influence any longer on its kinetics or dynamics. Previously published algorythms have failed to predict accurate regimens due to the lack of correlation between creatinine and aminoglycoside clearances. ~is study was conducted in order to validate a BE method for individualization of A dosages in current ICU practice. Methods : In a first step, plasma levels of A were determined in 22 ICU patients at T = O, i, 2, 4, 6 hrs, after the administration of a test-dose. A program using a classical least-squares estimation (LSE) method allowed for the computation of individual parameters. The patients (n=22) were then divided in 2 randomized groups : one (n=10) for computing population characteristics and the other (n = 12) for retrospective validation of BE using only 2 samples (T=I and 6 hrs). The predictive performances of BE were also estimated prospectivly in clinical practice (n=18 new patients) by comparison of achieved ver~ sus predicted peak and trough levels. Results : Comparison of parameters estimated by the 2 different methods (LSE and BE) shown no significant bias with a good precision for BE (15.3 %). The BE method was prospectivly proved to achieve desired peak and trough levels as indicated by the close correlation between predicted and measured concentrations ( Introduction. The aim of the investigation was to examine to what extent the PDA-induced partial blockade of sympathetic efferences to the heart interferes with the capacity of the cardiocirculatory system to adapt to the increased oxygen demand in the wake-up and warm-up phase after surgery, Patients and Method. 105 patients who had to undergo elective abdominal aortic surgery were randomly subjected to 3 anesthetic procedures: neuroleptanalgesia (NLA); halothane (H); thoracic PDA using bupivacaine 0.5% (sens.level Th3/5-L2/3) with intubation (diazepam for sedation). Hemodynamic profiles, including calculations of the oxygen supply (DO2) and oxygen demand (VO2) , were done at the following points: Op-end; arrival in the intensive-care unit; I, 2, 8 and 24 hours after Op-end.",

            "text": "Discussion. The decreased cardiac output in relation to the VO 2 under PDA indicates a reduction of myocardial contractility as a result of the partial blockade of sympathetic efferences to the heart, because no significant differences were found between the 3 groups with regard to the other determinants of cardiac performance, preload and afterload. These results are a warning to be cautious with this method in patients with reduced cardiac performance, since PDA by its sympathetic denervation properties can interfere with 3 essential compensatory mechanisms of the cardioclrculatory system. Problems: For the sedation of neurosurgieal patients, substances with a rapid elimination are preferable, for they allow the patient to wake up shortly after withdrawal and they facilitate neurological assessment. This is of special importance in patients who require mechanical respiration for one to three days after surgery of tumours close to the brainstem (e.g. large cerebellopontine angle tumours). Material and results: The effects of Methohexitone were studied in 30 ICU patients. An excellent toleration of controlled ventilation without major side-effects was observed. After withdrawal of the sedativa patients were generally awake and cooperative within 15 minutes, in a few cases within 2 houres at most. When a dosage of 100-200 mg/h was given, serum levels of about 3 pg/ml were obtained. In none of the cases could a cumulative effect be documented. Liver function tests showed a rise of GPT and GGL Intahepatic cholestasis did not occur. Sodium~ potassium and chloride levels were not influence% kidney function was not impaired. Conclusion: Because of its good steerability~ Methohexitone has been found usefull especially for the sedation of neurosurgieal patients. Introduction: The purpose oF this study is to evaluate the haemodynamlc effects of i.v. dlhydroergotamine in the treatment of hypotension following epldural analgesia wlth bupivacaine 0,5 %. Methods: i0 patients (53-80 years) who developed a 30 % decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) after a eomblned general and epidural anaesthesla despite the administr~'!on of fluids were investlgated, On arrlval in the anaesthetic room a'n electrocardiograph was attached, Under local anaesthesia, cannulae were inserted into a peripheral vein and a radial artery. A balloontipped flow-dlreoted thermodilution catheter was inserted into the pulmonary artery. Cardiac output was measured using the thermodilution method. Following stabilisation of the patient a baseline haemodynamlc profile (HP) (1) was obtained including systo11% diastollc and mean arterial pressure (SAP,DAP,MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI) and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance (SVR, PVR). Epidural anaesthesia wlth bupivacaine 0,5 % was given to obtaln a Th 7 level of anaesthesia. A HP (2) Early postoperative hypertension is a common problem in patlenta undergoing coronary after V surgery ( GAS ). Since Nifedipine has been employed only infrequently for this problem, it's hemodvnamic short-term effects werm to be compared to those of Glyoerin-trinitrate ( NTG ). In 24 patients undergoing CAS with normal lefL ventricular function hemodynamio responses to N~f and NTG were evaluated by serial determinations of cardiac output (CO) using standard thermodllution technique. Arterial and abrlei pressures were oootinously recorded. NTS was infused Intravenously %n g patients with an average dose of O~A mg/kg/h and Nifedipine with 0,04 mg/kg/h for I/2 h; 3 patients were controls by receiving no antihyperteneive therapy for abort time.

Intensive care patients frequently receive high concentrations of oxygen. In few hours microscopical damages may be observed mainly in the lung alveolar membranes and in the haemocoagulative system due to complement activation and peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (mainly of arachidonic acid).These events are mostly produced by oxygen free radicals in peroxidative reactions which produce malondialdehyde(MDA),ethane(E),pentane(P)and other alkanes.The concentrations of these metabolites,which are proportional to the extent of peroxidative damage,have been considered good indexes of lipid peroxidation in living organisms.Also leukocyte aggregation produced by the C5a fragment of activated complement, plasma concentration of fibrinopeptide A (FPA)and hemogasanalysis have been used as sensitive tests of oxygen free radical lung~ haemocoagulative damage.Two groups of 30 randomized intensive care patients in very bad conditions after surgery,sepsis,stroke received normal therapy.One group received also antioxidants as follows:ascorbic acid IOOmg/Kg/die parenteral,~tocopherol enteral+parenteral in order to maintain plasma values over 2,5mg/dl, ~ercaptopropionylglycine 15mg/Kg/die parenteral,propylgallate iOmg/Kg/die enteral.The following tests were performed every second day in both groups:expirated E and P ~aschrom~ tographic evaluation),plasma MDA and FPA (photometric method immunoenzymatic method),leukoeyte aggregation(nephelometric method)and hemogasanalysis.A notable difference in the pattern of these parameters was observed between the groups. Better parameters in the group who received antioxidants were well correlated with their improved clinical conditions The hemodynamio and gasometric effects of amrinone combined with fluid infusion were studied during experimental septic shock. In 16 dogs (27 ~ 2 kgs) anesthetized with pentobarbital and mechanically ventilated, a slow bolus injection of 3 mg/kg of E.coli endotoxin (05505, Difco) was followed after 30 min by intravenous saline infusion, with a rate adapted to maintain pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAW) at control level. Thirty min later, amrinone was added at the dose of 40 mcg/kg.min in B dogs. The 8 other dogs served as control. Total amount of intravenous fluids was 82 + 13 ml in the amrinonetreated dogs and 64 ~ 15 ml in ~he control dogs (NS).",

The increase in cardiac output was however in part related to a positive chrcnotropic action of amrinone. Multiergan failure is the most serious complication in diffuse fibrine-purulent peritonitis (DFPP). Additional immunoglobulin therapy is widely accepted, while its efficacy has not been proved in a larger number of patients or even in a randomized study. In a multicenter randomized controlled trial 288 patients suffering from DFPP were included. Half of them received additional immunoglebulin (total 76 g IgG and 5 g IgE) over a period of 5 days. Mortality rate was the same in both groups: 40 to 45 % of patients died. Concerning 46 patients treated in Munich, which were included within the multicenter trial, the results obtained show clearly that additional treatment with immunoglobulins is able tm normalize faster blood concentration of IgG, which was found on subnormal level from the very beginning. That finding, on the other side, did not seem to be of any influence on the outcome of DFPP. Low blood levels of immunoglobulins as present in DFPP should therefore be considered as a single aspect of global immunodepression due to shock or bacterial toxins~ while global immunodepression itself seems to be only a single aspect of multiorgan insufficiency. Appropriate treatment consists in removing surgically toxin and bacteria sources and in stabilizing circulatory function as soon and completely as possible.",

Bormann, J.Boldt, D.Kling, G.Hempelmann, Department of Anaesthesiology, University of Giessen, Giessen, Federal Republic of Germany Stress and pain induced by surgical trauma seem to be attenuated when calcium antagonists have been applied. METHODS: In order to ascertain the effect of ni= modipine, a new strong acting calcium channel blocker on anaesthesia and quality of analgesia during intra-and postoperative period twenty patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery were investigated in two groups. Ten patients received high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia (mean: 2,45 mg fentanyl/patient), whereas another ten patients were treated with 0,1 mg fentanyl/patient in addi= tion to nimodipine 1,0 ~g/kgbw x min (from onset of anaesthesia until start of extracorporeal circulation). RESULTS: Between the two groups were no signifi= cant differences with respect to perioperative course and postoperative demand for analgetics. All patients (n=20) had complete retrograde am= nesia. Plasma levels of various metabolic and en= docrine stress parameters, which were obtained frequently during the perioperative period lacked to demonstrate any difference between the two groups. DISCUSSION: The present data suggest an additive analgesic effect of nimodipine during surgery. This phenomenon is possibly due to a blocking effect of calcium channel blockers on nocicep= tive nerves. The present model assumes that cal= cium is essential in pain perception and that decreased calcium would result in analgesia. REFERENCE The influence of particulate matter appearing during infusion therapy requires a proof of their reaction and storage in the human lung. Up to now there have been only insofficient methods to detect and qualify these particles, lhe use of polarization microscopy and the scanmng electron mlcroscopy took the main part in the investigations but their capacity to qualify the perticulate matter is limited. improved scanning electron microscopy in ccmbinetion with an enengydispersive X-ray analyzing system can solve these problems and identify particulate matter down to 0,8~rn in size. ~is systam gave us the possibility to examine the character of these particles deriving frcm infusion solutions used during infusion therapy, in vitro, to store these characteristical data and to detect the particulate matter distributed into the longs by infusion therapy. 48 rabbits received an intensive therapy comparable to an intensive care of human patients. Using our technics we found the same particulate matter in animal tissue. Likewise, we could prove similar matter in equal numper in the lungs of deceased patients after intensive therapy. At the mement, we use a computerlzed math~natical model which allows us to relate the clinical data of our patients with the results of infused therapeutics, to look for a diminution of lung clearence for particulate matter in these patients, not beeing found in normal healthy volunteers. Frcm microscopy and the knewledge of the mathematical model may derive consequences for special filters. A double blind randomized study was performed on 50 asthmatic patients (pts) seen at the Emergeocy Room. 25 pts were administered an aerosol of Fenoterol (1.25mg)(Group I). The other 25 pts received an aerosol of Fenoterol (1.25mg) + Ipratropium (0.Smg)(Group II). The two groups were statistically comparable (age, heart rate (HR), blood pressure, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), pH, PaC02, PaO2, Sherwood's Score (SSc) and number of pts on regular theophyllJne therapy). Aerosols (4ml) were delivered through Hudson Mist Nebulizer. No other bronchodilator was administered throughout the study period. The aforementioned indices were measured before, 5 and 30 m~nutes after aerosol administration. Analysis of varlance showed a significant increase in PEFR and a decrease in HR and SSv 5 and 30 minutes after aerosols (See table) . Furthermore, a significant difference was found between groups, with statistically better results at both 5 and 30 minutes im group II. These slg~ificant differences were maintained when groups are compared according their pH (lower or higher than 7.30) or to the presence or absence of associated pathology.

(1982 In previous studies, we have shown that lipid infusion increases 02 consumption (V02) in hypermetabolie septic patients (Nanni 84), but not in non-septic surgical patients. Since VO2 measurements are affected by multiple factors, we have continued our studies utilizing an original instrument (SkatVO2, COSMED) which allows continous and reliable monitoring of VO2. The results of our present study (ten TPNsupported Intensive Care patients, day 1 to Ii after major surgery, studied before and after lipid infusion) suggest : i) in day i post-op., V02 is scarcely affected by TPN, due to cardiorespiratory instability; 2) from day 2 to day ii post-op.,there is a direct correlation (r2=.58) between the total caloric supply and V02, and mean VO2 increases (128 to 146 ml/min/ m2) as lipid administration increases total calorie supply from 26 to 45 keal/m2/h ; 3) increased caloric supply by lipid administration does not affect VO2 in patients with multiple organ failure (NOF). In conclusion, while monitoring V02 in the critically ill, we must consider that V02 changes are affected by several determinants, including non-nutritional (cardiorespiratory response, type of trauma, post-op.day, presence of sepsis or MOF) as well as nutritional factors (total caloric supply; % of lipid calories). The purpose of this prospective study was to detect early potential mediators of ARDS in major polytrauma pts (12) and also to evaluate the effect of a continuous aprotinin infusion (g Mill. KIU/24 h) (8 pts). Until now, 12 pts were studied (4 of them developed AP~DS), 8 of them (3 ARDS) received aprotinin. Plasma collections started within 1 h after injury, every 6 h during the first 30 h, twice daily the 2nd and 3rd days, once during the following 7 days. Leucocyte elastase and lactoferrin concentrations were high (5 fold basal levels) 1 h after injury; these levels increased I0 fold between 6 h and 18 h and remained high in all pts during the observation period, l~munoreactive trypsin (IRT) increased to abnormal levels day 3; in the ARDS group , plasma levels of IRT were significantly higher, while aprotinin not significantly influenced these levels. Plasma fibronectin was significantly higher in aprotinin treated pts, and lower, but not statistically significant, in ARDS pts. Antiproteases such as~ I proteinase inhibitor (~I-PI) and ~ ~macroglobulin (~p-N) were low during 12 h after trauma.~Afterwards, ~|zPI increased slowly to normal levels 24 h after trauma a~d reached high levels on day 7, W2-M increased slowly day 3 but remained widely below normal levels. Total C 3 concentrations were widely below normal levels (30%), complement fraction C3d was increased in all pts and the C3d/C ratio was maximal I h after injury. However, no significant differences in antiproteases concentration and complement activation were found between ARDS and non ARDS pts, and between aprotinin treated and non treated pts. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that polytrauma induced an important complement activation and a proteaseantiprotease imbalance. But actually, it can not provide further support for the hypothesis that these biochemical modifications are involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS, and that high aprotinin doses significantly influenced these modifications.

Twenty four patients admitted into ICU for a five year period in hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome were retrospectively studied to define initial prognostic factors. In these elderly patients (76 ~ 4.6 years) diabetes was unknown in 20 per cent of cases. A coma was described in only 54 per cent of patients and not related to the level of plasma osmolality nor to final outcome. The overall mortality was 46 per cent but death was directly related to non metabolic disorders in 64 per cent of cases.

We measured the parameter anti-LPS in serum using endotoxine from E. coli and salmonella by an ELISA. An age-dependent distribution of anti-LPS levels was found in 4000 healthy blood donors. The sam~ age-dependent pattern was demonstrated in 80 postsurgical patients at admittance to the intensive care unit. Anti-LP~ levels of more than 65 ~g/m! could be found only in 1% of all persons younger than 40 years, 15 % of all persons 40 to 65 years old, and 18 % of all persons more than 65 years old. According to the literature, such a level decreases the frequency of septic shock. In the follow-up study only] a part of the observed patients reacted with an increase om the anti-LPS titer 3 to i0 days after admission in the study. The titer reached in some patients a level which may be protective. In our opinion it is mandatory to measure the anti-LPS titers before and during therapeutic studies with anti-LFS.",

Given the current lack of an active therapy on the neurological disorders in IAP, we have reseed, in 2 patients, the possible effect of plasma exchange (PE). It was speculated, that PE might be beneficial by decreasing serum amino-levulinic acid (ALA) level. These 2 females had severe tetraplegia at presentation, with impaired swallowing and acute respiratory failure. Nerve biopsy showed in both cases a degeneratlve axonopathy. PE of 2 plasmatic volumes were carried out other-daily, 4 Limes in one patient, twice in the ether. No improvement was observed in either case. Plasmatic ALA level which was very hlgh before PE (respecbiveiy 64 ans 71~mol/1 -N <i0 ~mol/1) decreased following PE (respectively 48 and 21 ymol/1 after the first exchange) but shot up to i&s pre-PE value 48 hours later.

In patients having acute renal failure and receiving treatment with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) (2) , there has been no mention of a cortisol loss via the hemofiltration filter. The pump driven CVVH device produced an ultrafiltrate with a mean of 17 mllmin (range 15 -19 mllmin). To maintain an adequate intravasal and total body volume hemofiltration solution (20 -24 I/d) had to be substituted for the ultrafiltrate.",

Furthermore stress stimuli caused cortisol to rise again, so no rationale for corticoid substitution can be formulated by now. Adenine nucleotides are compartmentalized in cardiac tissue. To elucidate the cellular source of the adenosine (ADO) released by the heart, isolated saline-perfused guinea pig hearts were labelled for 30 min with 3H-ADO (*ADO) (5x10-8M), After a washout period either (a) hearts were freeze-clamped, (b) endothelial cells (EC) selectively removed or (c) cardiac metabolism altered by intracoronary infusion of isoproterenol (ISO) (4x10-9M) or application of HCI {pHart 7.4--) 6.9). Adenine nucleotides and -nucleosides in cardiac tissue, EC, and coronary effluent were separated by HPLC, and the relative specific activities (RSA) determined. RESULTS: After labelling with *ADO, RSA of ATP, ADP, and AMP is significantly greater in EC than in myocardial tissue indicating that *ADO was primarily taken up by EC. During control conditions RSA of ADO released by the heart is 15x10 -3 and comparable to the RSA of the immediate precursor AMP in EC (12xI0-3). ISO significantly increased left ventricular pressure and ADO release by the heart. However, RSA of ADO in coronary effluent immediately fell to 0.9x10 -~ thereby reaching the range of RSA of AMP in myocardial tissue. During HCI infusion, left ventricular pressure and ADO release were significantly reduced. RSA of ADO released was only transiently increased, but returned within two minutes to the control value. CONCLUSION: Under control oonditlons, most of the ADO released originates from endothelial cells. During acidosis the changes in RSA of ADO reflect a short increased contribution of EC to the release of ADO. During ISO infusion, most venous ADO comes from myocardial cells. disinhibition with hyperthermia, hyperpnoea, and taehycardia as well as extension spasms cause an increase of the basal metabolic rate by more than three times normal. Earlier attempts to counteract this increase with an energy supply of 7000 -8000 keal failed because of the limited utilisability.",

The daily nitrogen elimination amounted up to 40 g/d corresponding to a protein turnover of 230 g. The amino acid-/protein supply was 2 g/kg bw/24 h. The increased catecholamine secretion was suppressed by a combination of a noradrenergic neurone blocker with a non-cardioseleetive beta blocker without sympathomimetic intrinsic action. In previous studies with isolated perfused hearts beneficial effects of exogenous pyruvate on myocardial function have been demonstrated. The aim of the study presented was to prove this favourable influence on heart function and hemodynamics in a model of experimental heart failure in the dog. 20 dogs underwent morphine/chloral hydrate narcosls and artlficial ventilation with N20/02 (75/25). To measure heart rate (HF), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), ejection fraction (EF), dp/dtma x, left ventricular e~di~tolic pressure (LVEDP) and related parameters central venous, left ventricular and aortic catheters were placed; coronary blood flow (CBF) was determined with an electromagnetic flowmeter. We induced heart insufficiency (HI) by bolus injections of polystyrene microspheres (~ 43 ~m) through a left coronary artery catheter. When HI was accomplished (after 60 -80 min) a constant infusion of sterile and non-pyrogenic sodium pyruvate (PyrNA) or pyruvic acid (PyrA) was started and continued uninterrupted for the next 20 min. Determination of parameters was performed before, during (2 determinations), and after the infusion period. Results: During exogenous application of PyrNa and PyrA #mportant hemodynamzc parameters increased (CI: 29 -33 %, MAP: 15 -19 %, EF: 22 -30 %, dp/dtmax: 34 -42 %); HF and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) remained unchanged. This significant increase of myocardial contractility and CI -not influenced by HF and SVR -is in agreement with metabolic data obtained in the same study. They let us conclude that PyrNa and PyrA exert their beneficial positive inotrope actions by their predominance in myocardial subs~rate utilization amd their ability to build up energy rich phosphates immediately. Within 1982-1983 we treated in our ICU's 18 patients with multiple trauma and injuries of the chest,abdomen,pelvis and with long bones fractures.According to Injury Scale and Injury Severity Score/l/an average ISS in this group was 4~ pts,in 13 survivors 36.6 pts and in 5 patienLs who died 56.2 pts. In 198~ we have incluoled to the treatment continuous sympathetic blockades; cervicothoral, thoracal and /or lumbar depending on localization of injury. In all patients intratracheal installation of heparin was employed when controlled respiration with FT0~=0.6 and PEEP 15cnd{~O failed to improve Zr~erial blood oxygenation. This modified treatment was used in 8 patients with an avera-eg ISS 46.5 pts/one of the patients had even 67 pts/. Conclusion has been made that administration of sympathetic blockade and intratracheal heparin has had beneficial influence on survival of ~atients with severe injury after multiple trauma. A differentiated approach of treatment guided by clinical,CTscan,EEG and ICP monitoring,with a restriction of mechanical ventilation(MV) and sedation, has permitted to shortern considerably the lenght of stay, to treat a larger number of pts, to reduce infections, to improve the quality of survival of most severe pts.In spite of this,several pts require a prolonged stay in the Neurosur gical ICU (NSICU): during two years 382 pts were-admitted and 46 out of 170 IDBc pts spent more than 15 days in the NSICU (range 16-140 days). Two groups are considered:a) 30 pts who recovered consciousness within a month (coma:6.9~0.6 days, MV:5.5~1.6days) b)16 unconscious pts at one month follow-up, who showed long-lasting respiratory and metabolic troubles,severe vegetative fits and delayed complications that hampered the recovery despite intensive nursing and early physiotherapy (coma:15.3~1.7 days,MV:8.7\u00b11.7 days). 50% of pts in group a) showed a good recovery, 7 in group b) recovered consciousness, being 2 moderately and 5 severely disabled at I year follow-up. The Authors suggest that acute pts take the most part of attention, some pts losing their good possibilities of recovery because of delay or inadequacy of rehabilitation in the post-acute phase in NSICU. Consequently, next step will be a post-acute intensive care and intensive rehabilitation unit (RICU), where the \"ICU trauma\" could be avoided, a protocol of neurological and neurophysiological monitoring with the aim of identifying relevant clinical and prognostic factors should be followed, a problem-oriented management could be applied by skilled personnel whose intensity of interest might be more important than any specific techniques. The documentation of treatment ( the case histories ) of 432 patients with head and neck injuries treated in surgical and intensive care departments of 12 hospitals of various types has been the basis for an evaluation of the treatment results. In the material, l.e. in case histories of 550 patients with multiple injuries, the group of those with head and neck injuries was found to be the one with the highest mortality rate. The collected material enabled to compare the results of treatment of this group of patients not only on the different stages of treatment but also in the intensive care units of different grades. In the quantitative and comparative evalmation of the damages caused by head and neck trauma the Glasgow Coma Scale and the Injury Severity Score (ISS) calculated on the Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) and in some part of the material on Hospital Trauma Index (HTI) have been used. The results of treatment have been analysed with the use of the Trauma Score (Champion-Sacco), which enables the preliminary asseement of the survival probability of the traumatic patients.",

In the present study ABR were serially recorded in order to evaluate whether ABR test timing in relation to the injury could affect outcome prediction. 80 ABR test were recorded in 22 severely head-injured patients and the interpeak latency of waves V-I (CCT) was calculated. Two or more tests were recorded in each patient according to the clinical course~ In all cases the duration of the coma was more than a week-17 patients died or remained vegetative: among these 16 showed a CCT>4.48 msec or disappearance of wave Y~ while only one had a persistently normal ABR. In 3 vegetative patients ABR improved progressively during the clinical course and CCT dropped down 4.48 msec. In 4 survived patients the COT was less than 4.48 msec throughout the clinical course. Only one patient with CCT-4.64 on the first ABR test came out of coma, but remained severely disabled. Our results allow us to confirm the close correlation between CCT>4.48 msec and poor outcome previously reported (i) 9 furthermore they suggest that the degree and duration of ABR abnormalities might help to recognize patients who will die and those who will remain vegetative or severely disabled. Head injury is known to cause disturbances of the pulmonary function leading to an increase of the pulmonary right-to-left-shunt and these changes being postulated to be of prognostical relevance. Therefore the question arises whether and to what extend cerebral trauma is able to trigger the most early phase of ARDS, a centrally-initiated permeability-induced increase of the extravascular-lung-water-volume (EVLWV). As soon as possible after emergency care and transfer to the ICU 22 unconscious pat. with an isolated cerebral lesion and presenting decerebrate posturing on admission have been monitored hemodynamically by means of a Swan-Ganz-Catheter and an arterial line inserted into the femoral artery. Hemodynamic parameters as Well as EVLWV -determined by the double-indicator thermo-dyetechnique-have been taken b.i.d, for a maximum of up to six days after trauma. From the beginning on forward a continuous increase of the EVLWV could be demonstrated reaching its maximum on the 3rd day after trauma. Sur~ rivers (S) significantly differ from non-survivors (NS) both referring to the mean values of the time course (S: 6.1+0.2 vs NS: 11.3+0.4 ml/kg b.w.) and the corresponding maximum values reached (S:7.6~0.3 vs NS: 12.6+1.2 ml/kg b.w.). No correlation for the EVLWV vs the various hemo~ dynamic parameters could be proven. Our results demonstrate a severe isolated cerebral lesion able to trigger mechanisms to cause a permeability-induced increase of the EVLWV, which is shown to be prognostically relevant. ABR have proved to be very accurate prognostic indicators in severe head injury. Nevertheless the task of ABR is limited by some non-neurological factors, such as temporal bone fractures and hemotympanum. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether a correlation between ABR and SEP exists. 42 ABR and SEP tests were recorded during the clinical course of i0 severely head-injured patients. The ABR's central conduction time (or CCT, defined by the interpeak latency of waves V-I) and the cervico-talamic conduction time (or CTCT, defined by the interval NI3 -Nl8 on SEP recordings) were calculated. Statistical analysis with linear regression showed a significant correlation (P < O.OO1) between CCT and CTCT recorded in the same session. Our results suggest that the combined use of ABR and SEP may improve the outcome prediction and that CTCT might give useful information on brainstem dysfunction~ when ABR cannot be recorded owing to peripheral disturbances of the ear.

A study was done to compare intracranial pressure (IPC) and sagittal sinus pressure (SSP) changes in dogs after variousgrades of asphyxial arrest (AA), and ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrests (CA). 28 dogs received CA by asphyxiation (6-8 min) plus 0-7 min arrest, and 29 dogs received i0 min VF (n=20) or 20 min VF (n=9) by external DC shesk. The insults were induced during lightening from N20:O2-halothane-pancuronium anesthesia. Restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was to be within 5 min after 0-7 min AA or 10 min VF, and wi~thin 7 min after 20 min VF. Intensive care for 96 h included control of mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood gases, hematocrit and temperature. ICP was via a needle in the iisterna magna, and SSP by sagittal sinus catheter. Student's t-test was used to compare data. After 7 min AA (n=7) and i0 min VF (n=ll), ICP increased to20-50 torr, and returned to prearrest levels at 15 and 10 min postinsult (PI) respectively. After 5 min AA (n=8) ICP changed as after 7 min AA. After 20 min VF, ICP increased less than after i0 min VF, but MAP was significantly lower after 20 rain VF (p<.05).",

The same changes were seen after 5 min AA (SSP not recorded after 20 min VF). ICP response to CO 2 increase (autoregulation) was abolished for 10-20 ~in PI. We conclude that after 10 min VF, 0-7 min AA and 20 min VF and ROSC in dogs, ICP remained increased for 10, 15 and 20 min respectively.

Moreover, deglutition movements stimulated by the tube in the mouth favour its deplacement, while the difficulty of fixing and anchoring it to the mouth makes nursing probiematic. At present, it is possible to use automatic ventiiators suitable for electronic synchronization, like Siemens' 900 C Servo Ventilators. Synchronized for the beginning of the respiratory phase, they can be used on any patients, from babies to the old, both in intensive care and in anesthesiology. They can be set on several modeis of ventiiation. They enable different PEEP values to be appiied to the two lungs. They can also modify the I:E ratio, with the possibility of regulating both respiration time and pause independentiy of respiratory frequence. Descriptions of ARDS in paediatric patients are limited. 198o-5inour paediatric ICU 21 children were mechanically ventilated because of acute progressive respiratory failure regarded as ARDS. This study was undertaken to delineate predisposing factors and the mortality associated with this disease in children of more than 1 year of age. The mean age of all patients was 9.5 years (range 1.5-14 years). 13 (62%) children died; they all required loo% inspired oxygen, high inspiratory pressure and recieved a PEEP 5 cm H20. Their mean surviving time was 11.5 d after initiating ventilation. 8 patients survived the ARDS: their mean duration of ventilation was equivalent, but not all patients required loo% oxygen. 11 of 21 patients had a malignant underlying disease. 9 of them developed ARDS following a severe infection when they were leukopenic and thrombopenic. Two additional predisposing factors were MTX-intoxication resp. pulmonary damage due to hypereosinophilia. io children with different non-malignant underlying diseases developed ARDS: 2 children with a combined immunodeficiency, 2 patients with a protracted shock syndrome, 2 pat. with hypoxic brain damage, and I patient each with severe burning, lupus erythematodes syndrome, diabetes insipidus neurohormonalis, and congenital dystrophia musculorum, Major complications during intensive care were: bacterial infections, fungal sepsis in 5 patients (+ 3 suspected), pneumothorax in 3 children. The overall mortality was 62%. 8 children survived: 6 children with malignant diseases. The prognosis may be improved when the development of respiratory insufficiency will be diagnosed early: retrospectively 9 of our patients suffered from partial respiratory failure for a mean time of 12 hours (range 4 -48 hours) until mechanical ventilation was initiated. compared to conventional lung ventilation (C.V.) are the following: -increase of F.R.C. and effective VT in the more damaged lung, with reduction of hyperventiiation and barotrauma in the less damaged lung; -possibility of using selective PEEP in the tWO lungs to exploit its therapeutic efficacy and reduce hemodynamic failure.

Since 1982 25 neonates and infants have undergone CPD in our paediatric intensive care unit. The use of a closed dialysate circuit is essential for this mode of dialysis. Using a standardized treatment protocol it was possible to dialyse even very small premature infants for several weeks. Indications for dialysis were acute renal failure (ARF) (22 patients), otherwise untreatable heart failure with edema (HF) (2 pat.) and severe lactacidosis (LA) (I pat.). Median body weight was 2.8 kg (range 1.0 -10 kg). Median duration of dialysis was 10 days (range 2-89 days).In our experience CPD was a successful treatment modali ty to overcome azotemia, edema, acidosis and related problems of ARF, HF and LA. Complications of CPD were mainly metabolic derangements and electrolyte disturbances as for example hyperglycemia, hypoproteinemia and hypokalemia. Obstruction of the catheter by omentum occured 4 times. Prevention of these complications is possible. Preliminary clearance data of several metabolic substances and electrolytes are presented. 10 of 25 patients (40 %) recovered . Death was due to additional diseases as for instance congenital heart disease, respiratory failure or cerebral damage. In conclusion, CPD gives even very small neonates and infants who are badly ill a better chance of recovery and survival. ~IHOD : A Swan-Ganz catheter 5F was inserted in 9 critically ill children (IO months -7 years).

Mainly responsible are pulmonary engorgement leading to considerable cardiac strain and annihilated wind kessel function. A PDA-ligation was performed to shorten the course of distress and recovery, in 15 premature infants with respiratory distre~ syndrome, the mean date of birth was the 29,6 v-week after gestation and a mean birth weight of 1.250 g. With a pulsed doppler the flow velocity (V syst, V mean, V diast) and the pulsativity index in the anterior cerebral artery was determined before and after ligation of the ductus. Preoperatively V diast was significantly (p< 0,005) decreased. The pulsativity index increased compared to the healthy control group. Five of fifteen infants showed a reversed flow in the cerebral artery. In all cases the reversed flow vanished. The mean flow velocity was preoperatively reduced with 6,6 cm/sec, compared to the postoperative velocity of 9,6 cm/see. (p < 0,005). V syst in the PDA group was increased compared to the normal control group, so that the preoperative value was only sllghtly below the normal control group (p< 0,i0). Cerebral blood flow dependent on the left-toright shunt underiies considerable deviations, thus a large PDA may iced to possible isehaemie cerebral damage; the orgar~sm tries to compensate the diastolic steal effect ~ cerebral blood flow by increasing the systolic flow. In adults brain perfusion is maintened on a sufficiently high level even with low blood pressures. In preterm neonates autoregulation of brain perfusion is supposed to be less stable thus increasing the risk for cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage. We measured systolic velocity, enddiastolic velocity, mean velocity, and Pulsatility Index in the carotid artery in 12 shocked neonates (980-3800g) and 41 normal controls. Assuming approximately constant arterial diameters mean velocity reflects brain perfusion. Blood velocity was lower in shocked neonates. The decrease of enddiastolic velocity was more pronounced than that of systolic velocity. Blood velocity correlated with measured blood pressures thus indicating abolition of autoregulation. Conclusion: Abolition of autoregulation of brain perfusion in neonates can be detected by transfontanel Doppler investigations and thus indicates the danger of cerebral ischemia under clinical circumstances. In a two days old male newborn with a body weight of 3200 gm slightly increased breathing rate and pale skin colour was noted. No heart murmur was heard. Chest X-rays showed a small heart but beginning signs of pulmonary edema. When the baby was admitted to our Hospital, 2D-Doppler echocardiography was performed. In subxiphoid coronal and parasaggital views a huge additional vessel crossed the,diaphragm, arising behind the left atrium and connected to the portal sinus. Doppler flow curve showed venous characteristics, and a blood flow direction away from the heart was seen. Additionally a patent ductus arteriosus, a right-to-left shunt at atrial level and signs of pulmonary hypertension were found. The diagnosis of infradiaphragmatic total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage was proven by catheterization. The baby was put on Prostaglandin El, its condition however deteriorated. Rapidly increasing congestive heart failure made a surgical intervention necessary. Pulmonary veins were directly connected to the left atrium, the ductus arteriosus was ligated and the atrial septal defect was closed. Postoperatively no serious problems occured. 2D-Doppler echocardiography was the major tool of proofing anomalous pulmonary venous connections infradiaphragmatically in a newborn with otherwise noncharactcristic symptoms. Cimetidine, a specific H2-antagonist and a potent inhibitor of the gastric secretion was administered in 18 newborns not tolerating oral feeding (abnormal gastric residues and a microor macroscopic bleeding). Abdominal X-ray was normal before feeding was started. Most infants had been in a \"stressing situation\" before. A control group (15), in comparable clinical conditions, was given a placebo. Oral feeding was always a semi-elemental hypo-allergic diet (AIfare).",

In infants treated with cimetidine the gastric emptying time (evaluated by measuring the gastric residue) was markedly decreased compared to the control group. The drug shortened the intensive care period as feeding was earlier tolerated, and diminished this way the need for a central venous catheter.",

Calculations are perforeed by the computer. CETP~ (co2-elieination / alveslav slope) index is defined by the formula:~ i~e~ V ~o~; 5C~dV , ~ , l~The mathematical model is derived from the original equation by Schemer and cm~orkere which is based on several assumptions. Preliminary results: CETAS index was shoes to increase linsatily with increasing tidal volues, The Icx~st indices were seen in patients with chronic obstructive pul=onary disease (COPD) particularly i~ subjets with emphysema.

Rupture of the ventricular septum (VSR) in the acute phase of myocardial infarction (MI) requires accurate diagnosis to decide proper management and indications for surgery. Cardiac catheterization is the usual method to establish the diagnosis of VSR and to quantify the amount of left to right shunt. We tried to assess the use of a combined two-dimensional (2-D-Echo) and pulsed Doppler echocardiography (2-D-Doppler) in the diagnosis of VSR. We studied 4 patients with VSR in acute MI (3 anterior MI and I inferior Ml) by cardiac catheterization and echocardiography (2-D-Echo and pulsed Doppler, Irex III B). The VSR was confirmed by cardiac catheterization in all 4 patients (left to right shunt 47 -?6%). The 2-D-Echo directly visualized the VSR in only 2 of our 4 patients. The combined 2-D-Echo and pulsed Doppler detected unusual flow signals in the right ventricle due to the left to right shunt in all 4 patients. The location of these unusual flow signals coincided with the site of septal rupture confirmed at surgery. Thus the combined 2-D-Echo and pulsed Doppler provides a bedside noninvasive method for diagnosing VSR in patients with acute MI.",

Respirator settings were: Changes in Azrway pressures, hemodynamics and Vd/Vt are similar to literature. Reduction of oxygen consumption in prolonged IRV at decreaszng levels of cardiac performance could resemble a lower metabolic rate. Explanation and confirmation needs another study. All variables are reset to baseline after restoring CPPV except Vd/Vt which is a common finding in almost all IRV studies. The only beneficial aspect of IRV in theese patients is a reduction in peak airway pressure, known to reduce the risk of barotrauma.

Du~ng that time there was a marked increase in the number of patients with spontaneous intracerebr~ hemorrhages( from 10.2% in 1982 to 16.2% 1984 )   while there was a reduction in traumatized patients. Subsequently an increase of the mean age as well as in the length of stay in the ICU was observed ( 82: 3.84 days; 84: 4.44 days ). Length of stay was longest in patients with polytrauma ( 10.5 days ) and in patients operated on cerebellop~ntine angle tumors ( 7.8 days ). Total mortality was reduced from 21.6% to 16.3% during the study period. Reduction of mortality was greatest in patients with spontaneous hemorrhages ( 82: 51.6%; 84: 36.9% ) and in patients with elective operations ( 82: 10.8%; 84: 4.8% ). The occupancy rate raised from 66% in 1982 to 79.8% in 1984. Aggressive treatment of brain edema with barbiturates and pulmonary complicattions especially in elder patients resulted in an increase of ventilated patients ( 82: 23.4%; 84: 62.4% ), Although admissions to the ICU from other hospitals remained constant ( 52% ) more patients had to be transferred to normal units of our clinic after discharge from the ICU ( 82: 55%; 84: 62% ). The reasons for these trends and their consequences for early rehabilitation in our patient group are discussed.INTENSIVE CARE AND CEREBRAL DYSFUNCTION IN GERI-ATRIC PATIENTS. P. Lehmkuhl, D.

To roughly discriminate and quantitate the normal and abnormal areas we used the attenuation numbers (CT number), expressed as Hounsfield Units (H). The H units are -i000 for the air and 0 for the water. We arbitrarily choose the -400 H as discriminant value for the normality. Ten ARF patients underwent CT scan (Apex, Hilum, Basis) at three levels of PEEP. The area of each was highly correlated with the % normal areas (r = 0.94 p < 0.001).

The application of this technique described elsewhere (2,3) was reco~ended for difflcuit cases (3). Our results using this technique In difficult cases are presented. Methods: Prior to central venous cannulatlon Carotid Artery and Internal Jugular Vein were identifled by a unidirectional 8-MHz-CW-Doppier-equlpment and their course was marked on the skin. For 66 patients central venous catheters were necessary and the puncture problems were cats gortzed Into flve groups: 15\u00b0-head-up-posltion (In-tracraniaI pressure, heart failure) in 22 cases; unsuccessful previous puncture attempts In 16 cases; hematoms, goitre or anatomical irregularities in 13 cases; infants younger than 5 years In 10 cases; and coagulations disorders in 5 cases. Results: in 65 cases central venous cannulatton was successful; no serious complications were seen. Conciuston: A sometimes inevitable central venous line can be established even In difficult cases with the help of ultrasound doppler. This technique should be appiled in difficult cases and on patient under hlgh rlsk of an accidental puncture of Carotid Artery, because it is easy to ]earn and requires minima] technlcal equipment.

Conclusions : BE method requires only 2 samples for determination of amikacin dosages, and prediction of blood level in ICU patients. Our study demonstrate the accuracy of BE. Failures were correlated with rapid modifications of hemodynamic status, diuresis or renal function. Berger, R. Chiolero. Department of Anesthesiology, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland. Flecainide (F) is a new ic antiarrhythmlc it a valuable therapeutic agent in intensive care unit (ICU). F is extensively cleared by the kidney. Renal failure is thus expected to alter its elimination rate. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have not been found valuable for removal of F from the body, due to its large volume of distribution and to the intermittent nature of dialysis. Data on the effect of haemofiltration on F disposition are not available. We therefore evaluated the systemic and haemofiltration clearances of F in a patient in atrial fibrillation who developped septic shock and acute renal failure. The systemic clearance measured during a constant dose infusion (2.1 mcg/kg/min) was 402 ml/min (6.7 ml/kg/min).THE ANTICONVULSIVE ACTIVITY AND ACUTE TOXICITY OFDIAZEPAM IN THREE DIFFERENT PREPARATIONS. S. H~gskilde, J. W. Nielsen, P. Carl, H. Angelo, M. B. Sorensen, The Municipal Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.Purpose : To compare acute toxicity (LD50), minimal neurotoxicity (TD50) and anticonvulsive activity (ED50~ of diazepam in an emulsion form (Diazemuls ) with two d~fferent water based diazepam solutions (Valium ~ and StesolidR). Method : Peak drug activity and TD50 were determined in mice after intravenous administration of the different diazepam preparation. The ED50's against pentetrazol induced convulsions ( 66 mg/kg intravenous ) were then established at peak drug effect. Acute toxicity of the diazepam preparations was estimated as the mean lethal dose during the first 24 hours after the injections.Groups of 8 mice were tested for each dosage level and TD5O, ED50 and LD50 were calculated by the Licthfield -Wilcoxon method. Results : The most important differenc~ was a ~cantly higher LD50 ~f Diazemuls ~ ( 275 mg/kg ) ~ompared to Valium ~ ( 49 mg/kg ) and Stesolid ( 51 mg/kg.). ED50 was : Diazemu~s K 0.24 mg/kg, Valium ~ 0.14 mg/kg and Stesolid -0.10 mg/kg.Thus the therapeutic indices (LD~0/ED50) were cal~ulated to be 1146 for Diazemuls-350 for Valium-and 490 for Stesolld . Time of peak drug act~vlty and TD50 were equal for all three drugs. No signs of pain on injection or necrosis was observed following Diazemuls , where as this was common after Stesolid R and Valium R. Conclusion : This study on mi~e indicates that it m~yb-es-a-fer to use Diazemuls than the water based diazepam preparation in the treatment of acute convulsive states.
