            "text": "Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a tightly regulated and evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the sequestration, lysosomal degradation, and recycling of discrete intracellular portions of eukaryotic cells, facilitating the removal of materials not typically degraded by the ubiquitin\u2013proteosomal pathway. Regulators of this process include hormones and growth factors that suppress autophagy during cellular growth, as well as intracellular levels of nutrients, oxygen, and energy, allowing the pathway to act as a defense mechanism against inducers of cellular stress (Pattingre et al., 2008, Wullschleger et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2005). Perturbations in autophagy have been correlated with numerous pathological conditions, including oncogenesis and cancer progression, neurodegenerative disorders, liver disease, myopathy, and cardiac disease, highlighting the importance of this pathway in human health and cellular homeostasis (Levine and Kroemer, 2008, Meijer and Codogno, 2006, Mizushima et al., 2008). Autophagy has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of several viral infections and is suggested to act as both an inducer and effector of innate and adaptive immune responses against intracellular pathogens, including viruses. Currently, evidence suggests that viruses have evolved a diverse array of countermeasures to contend with this pathway; some inhibit autophagy and are negatively affected when this interference is abrogated, while others appear to subvert it to their own ends and respond positively when it is induced. However, still other viruses are seemingly unaffected by autophagy, and do not appear to regulate the pathway through any apparent mechanism(s). This review seeks to provide both a synopsis of currently known and suspected viral interactions with the autophagy pathway, and to stimulate a critical discussion concerning the central trends that have been suggested within this field of research.",

The reader is referred to more detailed reviews concerning specific aspects of autophagy, such as the formation and maturation of the autophagosome (Longatti and Tooze, 2009, Mizushima, 2007, Noda et al., 2009, Reggiori and Klionsky, 2005, Xie and Klionsky, 2007, Yang et al., 2005, Yoshimori and Noda, 2008), regulatory mechanisms of this pathway (Meijer and Codogno, 2004, Pattingre et al., 2008, Wullschleger et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2005), roles in innate antigen recognition and MHC antigen presentation (Delgado et al., 2009, Delgado and Deretic, 2009, Levine and Deretic, 2007, M\u00fcnz, 2006, Orvedahl and Levine, 2009, Schmid and M\u00fcnz, 2005, Virgin and Levine, 2009), and the relationship between autophagy and regulated cell death (Codogno and Meijer, 2005, Ferraro and Cecconi, 2007, Kroemer and Levine, 2008, Maiuri et al., 2007, Scarlatti et al., 2009). The core process of autophagy is the de novo synthesis of a double-membrane-bound vesicle capable of fusing with an endosome or lysosome, which ultimately leads to the catabolic degradation of the encapsulated cargo (Fig. 1\n). In mammals, this process begins with the expansion of a small, flat membrane sac of uncertain origin (termed the isolation membrane or phagophore). As autophagy-related (Atg) proteins are recruited to its surface, this membrane sac elongates and curves until the ends merge to form a double-membrane-bound vesicle (autophagosome). Atg proteins are then recovered or disassociate from the autophagosome, and the completed structure fuses with an endosome (amphisome) or lysosome (autolysosome). A brief overview of mammalian genes of particular significance in the regulation and execution of autophagy is provided in Table 1\n.",

Important activators of mTOR include the class I PI3K-Akt/PKB signaling pathway and high concentrations of specific amino acids; high AMP/ATP ratios and hypoxia inactivate this pathway (Arsham and Neufeld, 2006, Beugnet et al., 2003, Pattingre et al., 2008, Wullschleger et al., 2006). Activated mTOR suppresses autophagy, enhancing the accumulation of cellular bulk by limiting lysosomal digestion. Downstream of mTOR, Beclin-1 is at the heart of a regulatory complex for the class III PI3K hVps34, whose activity is essential during autophagosome formation. Activators, such as UV radiation resistance associated gene (UVRAG), Bax-interacting factor-1 (Bif-1), and activating molecule in Beclin-1-regulated autophagy-1 (Ambra-1) associate with the Beclin-1 complex and enhance PtdIns(3)P production, while the Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL bind to Beclin-1 and act in an inhibitory fashion (Pattingre et al., 2008, Sinha and Levine, 2008). The Bcl-2-related inhibition of autophagy is abrogated by stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1) phosphorylation and competition from other BH3 binding domain-containing proteins, providing one of several direct mechanistic links between autophagy and apoptosis (Sinha and Levine, 2008, Wei et al., 2008a, Wei et al., 2008b).",

The eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1) and the starvation-responsive general control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2) eIF2\u03b1 kinase are both indispensable for starvation-induced autophagy, suggesting that other eIF2\u03b1 kinases with important roles in antiviral defense, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), may also up-regulate this pathway in response to cellular stressors (Kouroku et al., 2007, Tall\u00f3czy et al., 2002, Tall\u00f3czy et al., 2006). Immune signaling molecules can modulate autophagy; type II interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor-necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) are stimulatory, while the TH2-type cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 are suppressive (Deretic, 2005, Levine and Deretic, 2007). Certain pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) trigger autophagy through their cognate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR4, and TLR7, although the molecular mechanism(s), physiological function(s), and range of PRRs that induce this pathway are all areas of continuing research (Delgado et al., 2009, Delgado and Deretic, 2009, Orvedahl and Levine, 2009). The p53 protein possesses a dual role in the regulation of autophagy dependent upon its localization; cytoplasmic p53 represses autophagy and must be degraded for autophagy to proceed, whereas nuclear p53 appears to induce it (Maiuri et al., 2009, Tasdemir et al., 2008). Many additional cellular factors, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2) activation (Pattingre et al., 2003, Shinojima et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2009), intracellular release of calcium (Gordon et al., 1993, H\u00f8yer-Hansen and J\u00e4\u00e4ttel\u00e4, 2007), increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Djavaheri-Mergny et al., 2007, Djavaheri-Mergny et al., 2006, Scherz-Shouval and Elazar, 2007, Scherz-Shouval et al., 2007), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Ding et al., 2007, Kouroku et al., 2007, Ogata et al., 2006, Yorimitsu et al., 2006) have also been shown to trigger the pathway to autophagy.",

First, as autophagy is a process with numerous components, steps, and phases, it is important to clarify whether a given assay measures a step within this pathway (such as LC3 lipidation) or its overall physiological consequence (the aim of protein degradation studies). Since several viruses have been shown to modulate autophagy at multiple stages with varying effects, it is often necessary to combine assays examining both induction and maturation in order to make accurate observations. Second, while autophagy is a responsive cellular process, capable of fluctuation, most assays capture this dynamic process at a single static moment in time. This can pose challenges, as cellular populations are frequently asynchronous and the effects of a viral infection may vary during the course of the cell cycle. Finally, as different cell types have been shown to display different autophagy responses, it can be difficult to make direct comparisons between different virus-cell systems. Particular caution should be used when studying viruses, like HIV-1, which infect more than one cell type. For further information regarding the limitations of current autophagy assays, readers are advised to consult excellent reviews on this subject (Klionsky et al., 2008, Mizushima, 2004).",

As such, many viruses are known to subvert host endosomal and secretory pathways in order to induce host membrane alterations that can then support viral replication and assembly (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008). A number of viruses have been shown to replicate in, or in close association with, multi-membraned vesicles that possess many of the characteristics of autophagosomes. Given the nature and location of these vacuoles, there is strong evidence that autophagosomes may serve as a site of viral replication during some infections and that the autophagy pathway might therefore be exploited by viruses to enhance virion production. Supporting this assertion, the membranes associated with viral replication are often derived from the ER, which has also been suggested as a source of the autophagic double-membrane (Mijaljica et al., 2006). Indeed, the similarities between autophagic vacuoles and some virally induced membrane alterations has lead to increased suspicion, and in some cases proof, of a connection between positive-stranded RNA viral replication and the autophagy mechanism.",

            "text": "A link between poliovirus (PV)-induced double-membrane vesicles and autophagy has long been suggested, and is often cited as the classic example of viral exploitation of the autophagy pathway. Ultrastructural and biochemical analyses have revealed that PV induces massive rearrangements in intracellular membranes, resulting in clusters of double-membrane-bound vesicles capable of supporting viral replication complexes (Bienz et al., 1987, Rust et al., 2001, Schlegel et al., 1996, Suhy et al., 2000). These PV-induced vesicles display the classic autophagosomal marker LC3, which has been hypothesized to be directly recruited by viral proteins (Jackson et al., 2005, Taylor and Kirkegaard, 2007). Subsequent studies have further shown that additional secretory vesicle trafficking molecules are also recruited during the formation of these membranous replicative vesicles (Belov et al., 2007), and that the association of these vesicles with the microtubule network aids in the non-lytic release of PV virion particles (Taylor et al., 2009). Hence, it has been postulated that PV factors initiate elements of both the interrelated secretory trafficking and autophagy pathways to ultimately create a membranous structure capable of supporting both viral replication and virion egress. Besides PV, several other picornaviruses also appear to subvert the autophagy machinery to promote their replication. The group B Coxsackieviruses, CVB3 and CVB4, induce autophagosome formation, and biochemical inhibition of this pathway negatively impacts virion production (Wong et al., 2008, Yoon et al., 2008). Similarly, the enteropathogen EV71 has been shown to trigger autophagy in vitro, and that this induction can significantly increase viral yield (Huang et al., 2009). Apart from the Picornaviridae family, two Dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (DENV-2 and DENV-3) have also been shown to interact with the autophagy machinery to promote their replication (Khakpoor et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2008, Panyasrivanit et al., 2009). Interestingly, the stage of the autophagic process with which DENV is associated varies depending upon the viral serotype involved; DENV-2 translation/replication complex has been shown to specifically locate with pre-lysosomal fusion amphisomes, while DENV-3 requires further vesicle maturation and post-lysosomal fusion vacuoles (autolysosomes) to efficiently produce virions (Khakpoor et al., 2009, Panyasrivanit et al., 2009). The autophagy pathway also appears to be critical in the replication of another Flaviviridae member, namely the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which has also been shown to induce autophagosome formation (Ait-Goughoulte et al., 2008, Dreux et al., 2009, Sir et al., 2008, Tanida et al., 2009). In the case of HCV, autophagy is thought to be responsible for providing membranous support structures during the initial translation and de novo replication of HCV RNA following infection, but subsequently contributes little to virus maturation once an infection is stably established in the host cell (Dreux et al., 2009, Tanida et al., 2009). Finally, basal levels of autophagy have recently been shown to enhance macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral protein processing and virion production in vitro, suggesting a role for autophagy in HIV biosynthesis in this cell type (Kyei et al., 2009).",

            "text": "While these results are strongly suggestive that viruses can subvert or induce autophagy in order to create advantageous membrane alterations, other research has demonstrated that this effect is not universal. Not all viral infections that induce membrane alterations, including some which are closely related to the examples provided above, modulate or are affected by the autophagy pathway. The replication of human rhinovirus 2, a picornavirus that shares many similarities with PV, is not affected by drugs that either inhibit or induce autophagy, and does not elicit the formation of LC3-positive vesicles (Brabec-Zaruba et al., 2007). Contradictory observations have been made for the Coronaviridae members, murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV); some studies have suggested that endogenous LC3 co-localizes with SARS-CoV and MHV vacuole-associated replicase proteins (Prentice et al., 2004a, Prentice et al., 2004b), yet other studies have had difficulty corroborating these results (de Haan and Reggiori, 2008, Snijder et al., 2006, Stertz et al., 2007). In line with these observations, MHV viral replication and release have been shown to be comparable in cells with both normal and defective autophagy mechanisms (Zhao et al., 2007). Likewise, the viral production kinetics of vaccinia virus, which has been shown to utilize double-membrane vesicles for its replication, was similar in wild-type, Atg5\u2212/\u2212, and Beclin-1-deficient cells (Zhang et al., 2006). Thus, subversion of autophagy as a mechanism for inducing membrane alterations may be either cell-type- or virus-dependent. These results suggest that considerable care should be exercised prior to concluding that autophagy is the mechanism responsible for membrane alterations observed under microscopy to ensure that they are biochemically and mechanistically connected to this pathway. While the evidence to date strongly indicates a positive role for autophagy in the replication of some viruses, the observed variation, particularly amongst closely related viruses, suggests that other mechanisms may exist for inducing similar alterations in host cells. One should approach these studies carefully with the correct diagnostic tools for autophagy.",

Furthermore, autophagy has been documented to function as a host cell defense against some intracellular pathogens. This process, which has been termed xenophagy (\u2018to eat what is foreign\u2019), results in the autophagic-lysosomal destruction of invading pathogens. Several bacterial pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Gutierrez et al., 2004), group A Streptococcus (Nakagawa et al., 2004), Shigella flexneri (Ogawa et al., 2005), Legionella pneumophila (Amer and Swanson, 2005), and Yersinia pestis (Pujol et al., 2009) have been shown to either actively inhibit or be degraded through xenophagy. Subsequently, this process has been demonstrated to be particularly important in restricting bacterial escape and survival. Just as xenophagy restricts certain bacterial pathogens, autophagy may capture replicating viruses or newly assembled virions within their host cells, and eliminate them through sequestration and lysosomal degradation (Kirkegaard et al., 2004, Levine, 2005, Wileman, 2007).",

Over-expression of Beclin-1 protected mice from fatal SINV encephalitis, reducing neuronal apoptosis and decreasing SINV viral replication (Liang et al., 1998). The antiviral and anti-apoptotic effects attributed to Beclin-1 in SINV infection in vivo suggested that autophagy may function as a defense against other viral infections. Since these initial observations were first published, further evidence has shown that autophagy may function as a defense against viral infections.",

In murine fibroblasts and neurons, mutant HSV-1 deficient in ICP34.5, a viral Beclin-1-interacting protein, but not wild-type virus, induced autophagy upon infection in a PKR-dependent manner (Alexander et al., 2007, Orvedahl et al., 2007, Tall\u00f3czy et al., 2002, Tall\u00f3czy et al., 2006). This viral induction of autophagy resulted in the observed localization and xenophagic degradation of virions within autophagosomes (Alexander and Leib, 2008, Alexander et al., 2007, Tall\u00f3czy et al., 2006). However, the exact significance of increased mutant virions within double-membrane vesicles and xenophagy is questionable, since suppression of autophagy through the use of Atg5\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) did not significantly alter the replication efficiency of either wild-type or ICP34.5 mutant HSV-1 in vitro (Alexander et al., 2007, Jounai et al., 2007). In the case of HSV-1, it is thought that while ICP34.5 expression can inhibit autophagy in infected cells, the prevention of PKR-mediated translational arrest, rather than regulation of autophagy, may be the pivotal determinant of HSV-1 replicative efficiency in cell culture (Alexander et al., 2007). In contrast to these in vitro observations, the suppression of autophagy in vivo by ICP34.5 appears to be critical in HSV-1 pathogenesis, since Beclin-1-binding-deficient ICP34.5 mutant viruses are neuroattenuated with regards to lethal encephalitis in mice (Orvedahl et al., 2007). Interestingly, this HSV-1 mutant's virulence can be reconstituted if the infection is conducted in mice deficient for the antiviral effector PKR (Orvedahl et al., 2007). The observed discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results may be due to cell-type dependent differences, and/or the effects of other HSV-1 proteins on the autophagy pathway (Alexander and Leib, 2008).",

While it is tempting to speculate that xenophagy, as demonstrated within the field of bacteriology, exists as a general host defense mechanism for the clearance of all intracellular pathogens, including viruses, the limited amount of direct evidence available at this time suggests that caution is warranted. In particular, care should be exercised in differentiating between the incidental inclusion of virion or viral components within autophagosomes due to either their uptake by background or stress-induced activation of this pathway, and enhanced, autophagosome-driven clearance of these materials.",

This process may play a significant role in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses to foreign pathogens. Research has shown that autophagy is involved in the delivery of various antigens (viral, self, and tumor origin) to MHC class II antigen-presenting molecules, which can in turn lead to the activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes (Levine and Kroemer, 2008). As an example, the delivery of Epstein\u2013Barr viral antigens to MHC class II-loading compartment (also known as late endosomes), prior to CD4+ T cell stimulation, has been shown to utilize the autophagy mechanism (Paludan et al., 2005). Constitutive autophagy in immune and epithelial cells has also been observed to participate in the delivery of LC3-tagged influenza matrix proteins to MHC class II-associated endosomal compartments, which resulted in enhanced antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells (Schmid et al., 2007). Furthermore, the importance of autophagy-mediated class II antigen presentation was recently demonstrated in the regulation of HSV-1 pathogenesis by viral ICP34.5 (Leib et al., 2009). As well, it has been shown that the immunization of mice with influenza A (IFA)-infected cells exhibiting enhanced autophagy facilitates more robust MHC class I antigen presentation to the CD8+ T cells (Uhl et al., 2009). This evidence suggests that autophagy may contribute to MHC class I/II-specific viral antigen presentation, aiding the induction of adaptive immune responses. These studies also raise the exciting possibility that it may be feasible to exploit autophagy to deliver viral antigens and enhance MHC class I/II presentation for the development of novel vaccines and adjuvant therapies (Schmid et al., 2007).",

TLRs play critical roles in detecting bacterial and viral signatures and in eliciting appropriate host cell defenses such as IFNs and inflammatory cytokines against bacterial and viral infections (Takeuchi and Akira, 2007). It has been recently shown that the delivery of viral nucleic acids to endosomal TLRs in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) can occur through the autophagosomes (Lee et al., 2007). While most TLRs reside on the cell surface, a subset involved in the detection of viral gene products, including TLR3, 7/8, and 9, is located in endosomal compartments and aids in the detection of endocytosed viral material (Barton, 2007). Autophagosomes could theoretically facilitate the sequestration, delivery, and detection of cytoplasmic viral nucleic acids, thereby helping to elicit a classical IFN response (Levine and Deretic, 2007). Indeed, autophagy has been shown to mediate ssRNA virus recognition through TLR7 during vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sendai virus (SENV) infection. It contributes to the production of interferon-\u03b1 by pDCs in vitro and in vivo (Lee et al., 2007). Hence, this intrinsic pathway may play an important role in the detection of viral antigens and in the induction of the subsequent IFN response in pDCs.",

            "text": "More recently, evidence supporting the involvement of autophagy in the TLR-related detection of viral PAMPs has increased with the finding that TLRs themselves can induce autophagosome formation. This suggests a potential feedback circuit involving autophagy in the pathogen-triggered immune response. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced autophagy has been demonstrated in both murine and human macrophages, and requires the TRIF (Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-\u03b2)-dependent TLR4 pathway, whose downstream components include the receptor-interacting protein (RIP1) and the p38 MAPK (Xu et al., 2007). While the physiological importance of this TLR-mediated induction is currently unclear, it suggests that TLR4 can induce autophagy, which may help to limit the spread of pathogenic infections. More importantly, it appears that there is cross-talk between the two pathways and that the autophagic machinery may be regulated by TLRs. TLR3 (dsRNA recognition), TLR7/8 (ssRNA recognition), and TLR9 (recognizes dsDNA with unmethylated CpG motifs) can identify viral signatures (Kawai and Akira, 2006). TLR4 can also recognize mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) envelope protein (Rassa et al., 2002) and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein (Kurt-Jones et al., 2000). In addition, TLR2 recognizes the envelope proteins of HSV-1 (Kurt-Jones et al., 2004) and human cytomegalovirus (Compton et al., 2003), as well as the measles virus hemagglutinin (Bieback et al., 2002). As many of these TLRs share downstream adaptors TRIF and myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88) (Kawai and Akira, 2006), it is possible that apart from TLR4, other TLRs may also trigger autophagy.",

Furthermore, MEFs deficient in Atg5 or Atg7 are resistant to VSV infection, more sensitive to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly:IC) treatment, and produce higher type I IFN responses following either treatment (Jounai et al., 2007, Tal et al., 2009).

            "text": "Autophagy is involved with many biological pathways linked to cellular stress, and the signals that drive the activation of autophagy may ultimately decide the fate of the cell. Indeed, it has been suggested that autophagy possesses a dual role in mediating cell survival and cell death. As a survival mechanism, autophagy sustains cell viability during brief periods of cellular stress, either by providing metabolic substrates in times of shortage, or by removing damaged organelles in order to prevent apoptosis. On the other hand, autophagy has also been shown to induce cellular death under certain circumstances, which has been characterized as a form of programmed cell death (type II PCD) that differs from the more classical apoptotic (type I PCD) and necrotic forms of cell death (Levine and Yuan, 2005). Inhibition of autophagy can trigger apoptosis under starvation conditions (Boya et al., 2005), whereas cells deficient in the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak proteins undergo autophagic cell death upon treatment with strong pharmacological agents such as etoposide (Shimizu et al., 2004). More importantly, based on autophagy's dual nature with regards to cell fate, it has been suggested that this pathway might have important roles in the development of cancer and tumor suppression (Baehrecke, 2005, Gozuacik and Kimchi, 2007, Kondo et al., 2005, Levine and Yuan, 2005) (Brech et al., 2009, Eisenberg-Lerner et al., 2009, Maiuri et al., 2009, Morselli et al., 2009, Scarlatti et al., 2009).",

Autophagy has been suggested to extend the survival time of human parvovirus B19-infected erythroid cells during viral expansion (Nakashima et al., 2006). Furthermore, protection against SINV-induced neuronal apoptosis and encephalitis in mice is conferred by concurrent over-expression of Beclin-1, but not anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (Liang et al., 1998). The hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded transcriptional transactivator protein X (HBx) has been shown to up-regulate the expression of Beclin-1 and stimulate autophagy (Tang et al., 2009), an effect that was also observed in HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) (Song et al., 2004). Interestingly, HBx has long been suggested to be tumorigenic (Kim et al., 1991), while Beclin-1 is commonly regarded as a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor gene (Qu et al., 2003, Yue et al., 2003). Hence, autophagy could be up-regulated by HBV to prolong cell survival, and this process may help initiate the development of HCC through an as yet uncharacterized mechanism.",

Hence, while autophagy has been generally characterized as a pro-survival mechanism, certain viruses may counter-intuitively block this process in order to prolong the survival of infected cells. The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-encoded viral Bcl-2 (vBcl-2) protein inhibits autophagy through its interaction with Beclin-1 (Pattingre et al., 2005) and similar effects have also been observed with the closely related murine \u03b3-herpesvirus-68 (\u03b3HV-68)-encoded vBcl-2 molecule M11 (Ku et al., 2008, Sinha et al., 2008). However, in addition to their effects on autophagy, vBcl-2s from \u03b3-herpesviruses also protect infected cells from apoptosis (Choi et al., 2001, Moore and Chang, 2003). While some authors have suggested that vBcl-2 help \u03b3-herpesviruses escape autophagic degradation (Pattingre et al., 2005), given the powerful anti-apoptotic role of vBcl-2 it is difficult to gauge the relative importance of these effects. More recently, the KSHV viral FADD-like interleukin-1-\u03b2-converting enzyme (FLICE)/caspase-8-inhibitory protein (vFLIP) was shown to suppress autophagy by interfering with the processing of LC3, and that this effect abrogated autophagy-associated cell death in infected cells (Lee et al., 2009).",

During HIV infection, expression of HIV envelope glycoproteins (gp120 and gp41, collectively termed \u201cEnv\u201d) induces autophagy in uninfected bystander CD4+ T lymphocytes, which results in a novel cell death program with characteristics of both type I and type II PCD (Espert et al., 2006). Thus, it has been suggested that this autophagy-mediated phenomenon may be significant in contributing to general CD4+ T cell losses during the course of HIV infections (Espert et al., 2006, Espert et al., 2007, Levine and Sodora, 2006). Similarly, HIV gp120 could also enhance autophagy in uninfected neuronal cells, leading to neuronal cell death and potentially contributing to HIV-associated dementia (Spector and Zhou, 2008). Interestingly, in plants, autophagy has been shown to protect bystander non-infected cells from cell death induced by Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection (Liu et al., 2005).",

It is important to note that it is inherently difficult to distinguish between autophagy as a mechanism of virally induced cell death and a cellular response to infection. Furthermore, there is potential that this may be a pathway whose biology is commonly modified in laboratory cancer cell lines used in virology research (Baird et al., 2008). For example, autophagy has been suggested to regulate the death of brain tumor and prostate cancer cell models infected with engineered adenoviruses (Alonso et al., 2008, Ito et al., 2006, Jiang et al., 2007, Rajecki et al., 2009, Ulasov et al., 2009, Yokoyama et al., 2008), but conflicting results have also suggested that this response may actually be an attempt at survival (Baird et al., 2008). Moreover, as characteristics of both type I and type II PCD are often seen in conjunction, it is often difficult to differentiate whether the observed phenomenon is an executioner mechanism or a futile attempt at cell survival. Nonetheless, from the above discussions it is clear that autophagy can contribute in the regulation of cellular fate, and as such may be specifically regulated by viruses to promote their life cycle.",

While this relatively new area of research has produced a number of exciting results, limits in our understanding of the mechanism, its regulation, and in the available investigative tools continue to present challenges, as would be expected in any emerging area of research. One complexity for researchers is that the regulation of autophagy is intimately interconnected with cellular growth and survival, as well as numerous cellular stress responses. Hence, considerable caution should be exercised before an effect on viral replication is directly attributed to this pathway. Furthermore, the natural complexity and diversity of viral pathogens and their host cells has resulted in numerous conflicting observations, making it difficult to draw clear and concise conclusions regarding the general role of autophagy in viral infections.",

            "text": "Despite these and other challenges, there is increasing evidence that this ancient cellular process is a significant factor in the fate of numerous different viral infections. During poliovirus infection, autophagy promotes viral replication through its most primitive function: the ability to induce membrane remodeling and vesicle formation. The processes of xenophagy and immune surveillance via cytoplasmic sampling suggest that autophagy may have evolved to act as a defense against intracellular pathogens that viruses must now contend with. Finally, autophagy's interconnections with cell death programs ingrain it in processes that ultimately determine cellular fate, suggesting that viruses may modulate it to influence cell survival and ensure their own reproductive advantage. Thus, autophagy may be implicated in the biological pathogenesis and/or replicative success of many viral infections through a wide variety of possible mechanisms, and can exhibit multiple distinct and cell-type-dependent roles in the course of a single viral infection. This is best illustrated in the case of HIV, where the autophagy machinery is: 1) down-regulated in virally-infected CD4+ T cells (Espert et al., 2009, Zhou and Spector, 2008), which may constitute a strategy for avoiding autophagosome-mediated degradation and/or endosomal detection in order to enhance virion production; 2) engaged in HIV-infected macrophages to promote virion production (Kyei et al., 2009); and 3) activated in bystander neurological and immunological na\u00efve cells to commit cell death by type II PCD, thereby contributing to HIV pathogenesis (CD4+ T cell depletion and neuronal death associated-dementia) (Espert et al., 2006).",

As new research tools emerge, continuing research will help to clarify the role of autophagy in viral replication, host immune responses, and viral pathogenesis. The intricacies of viral interactions with this ancient and highly conserved pathway strongly suggest that autophagy can function in a myriad of ways, some of which appear contradictory at first glance.
