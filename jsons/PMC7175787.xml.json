Specifically, user-generated social media data can be mined to assess the public\u2019s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors toward the disease, and can be particularly informative when cross-validated with traditional disease surveillance data [13-17].

Sina Weibo is a microblogging website (also known as the Chinese equivalent to Twitter) and one of the most influential social media platforms in China. According to its own press release in August 2020, it had over 486 million active users [19]. Users can publish content such as messages in microblogs and share text, pictures, videos, and music. Compared with WeChat, another popular social media platform in China, Weibo posts are generally more publicly visible; with WeChat, posts are generally more private and only visible to certain people selected by users. Due to the public nature of the platform, we attempted to assess whether Weibo posts about COVID-19 were predictive of the number of reported cases during the outbreak\u2019s early stages and conducted a qualitative analysis of COVID-19\u2013related themes detected and discussed by users located in Wuhan.",

Weibo users can post messages limited to 2000 characters with or without images, videos, and other multimedia, and can repost messages equivalent to the retweet function on Twitter. Python scripts were set to continuously collect data filtered for COVID-19\u2013related keywords from December 23, 2019, to January 30, 2020. Keywords included the Chinese-language terms: [\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2] (coronavirus), [\u65b0\u578b\u80ba\u708e] (novel pneumonia), [\u6b66\u6c49\u80ba\u708e] (Wuhan pneumonia), [\u75ab\u60c5] (epidemic situation), [\u975e\u5178] (severe acute respiratory syndrome), [\u534e\u5357\u6d77\u9c9c\u5e02\u573a] (Wuhan Seafood Wholesale Market). These keywords were chosen on the basis of manual searches via the platform\u2019s public search function to detect a baseline of user conversations related to the outbreak for our systematic data collection processes. The variation in selected keywords was also necessary, as the official name of the disease was not announced until February 11, 2020 [20]. These data collection methods are consistent with other analyses of health-related posts (including flu-related topics) on the Weibo platform not related to COVID-19 [21].",

Modeling of daily changes was conducted using the final 20 days of data, as prior days did not exhibit daily changes in posts, cases from Hubei, or cases from the remainder of China.

We primarily relied on inductive coding approaches starting with Weibo COVID-19 posts identified but also informed this inductive coding based on themes detected in existing literature from prior disease outbreaks [18,21]. Coders individually selected parent topic classifications to represent different thematic areas and collapsed infrequent categories into parent classifications. We then combined the related topics, removed duplicate topics, and evaluated thematic concurrence by independently coding the entire sample of posts collected from the early period of the outbreak with detected COVID-19-related posts (December 31, 2019, until January 20, 2020.)",

For the official number of cases within mainland China excluding Hubei Province, we found approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 60 social media posts (cases=0.164*posts\u2013143.21; P<.001; R2=0.652). These results indicate that there was a statistically significant positive relationship with Weibo posts and official case counts from within Hubei, and that the effect size was larger than what was observed in the rest of mainland China excluding Hubei. The linear regression also showed a significant inverse relationship between Weibo posts and the incidence proportion of cases reported in Hubei among all incident cases in mainland China (Wuhan cases proportion=\u20130.003*posts+100.2; P<.001; R2=0.836). Social media posts were also predictive of the percentage increase in COVID-19 cases in mainland China excluding Hubei (percent daily case increase=0.00013*posts+0.02; P<.001; R2=0.827), but not Hubei alone (percent daily case increase=0.000016*posts+1.22; P=.23; R2=0.091). These results may imply that 1000 additional posts from Wuhan predicted a 13% day-to-day increase in the number of cases for the rest of China but did not predict a local increase in cases. Therefore, it is possible that the numbers of outbreak-related Weibo posts are reactive to local disease conditions while being predictive of disease conditions for the broader region.",

Hence, it is not generalizable to all COVID-19 social media conversations occurring among Chinese users. We did not examine Chinese private communication apps (eg QQ, WeChat) due to the difficulty of collecting data on these platforms. Future studies should assess a broader scope of conversational data from multiple platforms and use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to help classify larger volumes of conversations. Second, our data collection started from the reported early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. During parts of this time period, the causative agent had not been confirmed and there was no official name for the disease. Due to early inconsistency in terminology, Weibo users may have used other keywords to describe COVID-19 that were not collected in this study. Third, the simple linear regression showed a positive correlation between COVID-19 Weibo posts and the number of Wuhan cases in the study time frame, but we did not control for other potential confounders. Further, it is unclear whether our observed predictive trend line would continue or if the trend line is generalizable to other instances of COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries or communities. It is more likely that only under specific disease transmission circumstances would this correlation occur, namely a lack of knowledge and reporting of an outbreak in its early stages, a novel virus with high transmission and sustained community spread, and high social media engagement involving outbreak conversations. Further, as previously stated, it is highly likely that the volume of posts are associated with user reactions to news events and government announcements.
