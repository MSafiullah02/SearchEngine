Archaea live in extreme environments. They are divided into three main groups on the basis of living environment: extreme thermophiles (live in high-temperature environments, rich in sulfur compounds and low pH, such as hot springs and geysers), extreme halophiles (live in environments with high concentrations of NaCl, such as the Dead Sea), and methanogens (live in anaerobic environments such as swamps, produce methane and do not tolerate oxygen).",

The cell membrane is composed of the phospholipid bilayer, which contains proteins and carbohydrates. The phospholipid bilayer is also the basic component of other biological membranes.

A prokaryotic cell contains DNA, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and also some of the following components: cell wall, capsule, slime, flagellum and fimbriae/pili (Fig 1.1 ). It does not contain organelles. Prokaryotes are always single-cell organisms; however most are capable of forming stable aggregate communities. When such communities are encased in a stabilizing polymer matrix (\"slime\"), they may be called \"biofilms\". Bacterial biofilms may be 100 times more resistant to antibiotics than freeliving unicells and may be nearly impossible to remove from surfaces once they have colonized them. A bacterial cell wall contains a unique structure called peptidoglycan. Archaea do not have peptidoglycan, which means that they are resistant to many antibiotics interacting with the cell wall. Due to differences in cell wall structure and the effect of staining by the Gram dye, bacteria can be divided into two groups: Gram-negative and Gram-positive. The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria consists of three layers: the periplasmic space, which is an open area on the outside of the plasma membrane, then a thin layer of peptidoglycan, and an outer membrane surrounding the peptidoglycan.",

These are (usually) circular DNA molecules that are replicated independently of the chromosome. Plasmids often contain genes that could be very useful, for example include information how to use a compound present in environment. If this compound is in the environment, the bacteria gain an obvious advantage over other bacteria, which do not have the ability to decompose that compound. Plasmids can be different in sizes, from tiny to megaplasmids exceeding the size of the genomes of some bacteria. Plasmids are natural vectors, by which continuous exchange of genetic information among bacteria (sometimes even completely unrelated) occurs. For example, many antibiotic resistance genes reside on plasmids, facilitating their transfer.

For example phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylinositol belong to this group. Chains of fatty acids in biological membranes usually contain an even number of carbon atoms, generally from 14 to 24. There are saturated (the neighboring carbon atoms are linked by a single bond) or unsaturated fatty acids (when some of the neighboring carbon atoms are connected by a double bond). The chain length and degree of saturation of fatty acids in lipids has significant influence on the fluidity of biological membranes. When phospholipid molecules are placed in water, the hydrophilic heads are oriented facing the water and the hydrophobic tails avoid water.

            "text": "Viruses are macromolecular complexes built from proteins and nucleic acids. Viruses are not able to replicate by themselves -so they can not be treated as living organisms. Replication of viruses is possible only within other cells, using enzymes from infected cells. Because of that viruses are intracellular parasites. Most viruses have a diameter between 10 and 300 nm (but discovered in 2013 Pandoraviruses have a size approaching 1\u03bcm). The molecule of the virus (virion) consists of one or more molecules of DNA or RNA (as a carrier of genetic information of the virus) and a protein shell called a capsid. Some viruses have an additional lipid envelope which surrounds the capsid. Most viruses are pathogens -after penetration into living cells they cause the diseases. Various viruses specifically attack different types of cells (e.g. the HIV virus attacks only the immune cells, mainly T lymphocytes). When a virus encounters \"his\" cell, it attaches to the cell membrane using specific receptors (proteins on the surface of host cells, which normally have other functions). Then, it can inject its genetic material into the cell or whole virus is absorbed entirely by the cell. Inside the cell, based on the information contained in the genetic material of the virus, there are created new virus molecules. They can remain in the cell for a long latent phase, or leave after the cell destruction. It sometimes happens, that the virus remains in the cell in form of genetic material integrated with the host genome.",
