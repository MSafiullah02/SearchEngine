            "text": "Mammalian reoviruses (MRVs), members of the genus Orthoreovirus, are non-enveloped double-stranded RNA viruses with a genome composed of 10 segments (Song et al., 2008). They were found in hosts with or without clinical manifestations (Dermody et al., 2013). MRVs are known to cause mild enteric and respiratory infections in humans. They are widespread and infect a broad spectrum of mammals. To date, MRVs have been reported in various mammalian hosts, including humans and animal species (Steyer et al., 2013, Decaro et al., 2005). In the last few years, they have often been described as the sole pathogen in various hosts presenting severe clinical manifestations, such as hemorrhagic enteritis, acute respiratory infections, central nerve system implications, and others. Recently, several groups reported infections of bat species with MRVs which resulted in visible pathologies in the organs of infected bats (Kohl et al., 2012, Lelli et al., 2013). They speculated on the possibility of bat-to-human interspecies transmission, but no evidence to support this hypothesis was provided. A MRV isolation and molecular characterization of a MRV-3 strain from a dog with diarrhea are reported. The reovirus isolate showed an atypical hemagglutination pattern and a retarded electrophoretic mobility of the S1 segment, which is characteristic of MRV type 3 (MRV-3). The authors proposed that these viruses might be important zoonotic pathogens (Decaro et al., 2005).",

It persisted in civets for weeks. Biochemical and structural studies of virus\u2013receptor interactions reveal close evolutionary relationships among the civet and human viral strains and thus support the critical roles of civets in transmitting SARS-CoV to humans. The zoonotic potential of reoviruses has been described and discussed elsewhere (Chua et al., 2008, Chua et al., 2011, Kohl et al., 2012). The transmission of reoviruses from one host to another is not limited to close contact but can be achieved through indirect transmission.",

In this study, we report the isolation of a novel MRV strain from organ tissue of the masked palm civet. To evaluate the genetic properties of the MPC/04 strain, its genome was sequenced and analyzed. The characterized genome of MPC/04 provides clues to aid the identification of characteristics of Chinese field strains. To the best of our knowledge, the MPC/04 strain can readily establish infection by the respiratory route, and it demonstrated fatal respiratory infection in mice.",

Ultra-thin sections of infected Vero E6 cells displayed typical electron-dense virus particles organized in a paracrystalline pattern within the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B\u2013b). Genomic pattern analysis on SDS-PAGE showed that MPC/04 had 10 dsRNA segments that migrated in a pattern highly consistent with those of members of the MRV species, dividing MPC/04 RNAs into three size classes: three large (L1, L2 and L3), three medium (M1, M2 and M3) and four small (S1, S2, S3 and S4) segments in the gel (Fig. 2\n).",

This study is the first description of an MRV strain found in masked palm civet, and one of the 192 samples (0.52%) was classed as positive by PCR and electron microscopy. Although the sample quality could have been a contributing factor to the low success rate, the isolation procedures also need to be further improved to increase the success rate of MRV.

In this study, the genotypes of MPC/04 were analyzed and verified by electrophoresis of viral genomic RNA. Electropherotype of MPC/04 shows 3-3-4 migration pattern that is typical of the mammalian reovirus. The whole-genome sequence comparison of our strain to MRV genomes available in GenBank clearly shows that MPC/04 isolation is most closely related to the BYD1 and MRV-HLJ/2007. The MRV BYD1 strain analyzed was isolated from the throat swabs of one SARS patient of China, which can cause clinical symptoms similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome in guinea pigs and macaques (Song et al., 2008). Comparative analyses of the BYD1 genome demonstrated it is a novel reassortant virus: its S1 gene segment derives from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and its other nine segments derive from ancestors of homologous type 1 strain Lang (T1L) and type 3 strain Dearing (T3D) segments. MRV-HLJ/2007 was isolated from swine in Heilongjiang Province, China (Zhang et al., 2011). Phylogenetic analysis of MPC/04 showed that the isolation from palm civets was the reassortment of gene segments during mixed infections with more than one MRV isolates in nature. The results indicate that the isolated virus MPC/04 may be a novel and reassortant virus. Moreover, the potential function of these genes may be important for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms and should be studied further.",

            "text": "MRVs were traditionally believed to be causative agents of mild respiratory and enteric infections without significant clinical impact (Steyer et al., 2013). However, several recent studies have suggested that MRV can cause serious illnesses, even death in humans and other mammals, including upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhea and encephalitis (Tyler et al., 2004, Ouattara et al., 2011, Steyer et al., 2013). Indeed, the pathogenesis of reovirus infections has been most extensively studied using both suckling and adult animals, and infections lead to systemic viral replication, morbidity, and mortality (Dermody et al., 2013, Doyle et al., 2015, Organ and Rubin, 1998). Natural infection with MRV may involve either the nasal and/or oral routes of transmission. Therefore, we firstly tested the route of infection in four ways: intranasally, intracranially, intraperitoneally and intragastrically with different doses of the MPC/04 strain. We found that mice were easily infected via intranasal inoculation with MPC/04, exhibited noticeable respiratory distress and body weight loss. To measure the potential pathogenicity of the strain, experimental infection using animal models is necessary. Furthermore, mice inoculated i.n. result in extensive lung infection. We observed approximately 70% mortality in mice inoculated i.n with 107\n PFU of MPC/04 strain and 0.93% mortality in other routes. Previous study of reovirus infection to respiratory tract showed that both T1L and T3D reoviruses can infect the adult and suckling mice via i.n. inoculation (Gauvin et al., 2013). The highest dose of T1L (1 \u00d7 107\n PFU) induced signs of disease and resulted in the death of 4 of 6 mice commencing 7 days post infection. However T3D does not efficiently infect mice by oral route, because the T3D \u03c31 protein is hypersensitive to cleavage by digestive enzymes (Chappell et al., 1998, Nibert et al., 1995). Our results confirm that MPC/04 strain is pathogenic to four-week-old female BALB/c mice. Additional studies are needed to understand that pathogenicity of MPC/04 to other animals.",

To determine the kinetics of replication, we analyzed viral titers in lung, brain, liver, intestine and spleen after intranasal infection with MPC/04. We found that the viral titers in the lung were higher at 7 days for mice in comparison with other tissue. Moreover, mouse in 107\n PFU inoculation group displayed severe acute respiratory symptoms and died from day 7 dpi. Recent studies have indicated that adult mice were infected intranasally with 107\n PFU of both T1L and T3D for histopathological assessment of brain, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, kidney and intestine (Gauvin et al., 2013). The histological observations were consistent with the virological findings in that organs with higher viral replication revealed greater signs of pathology, namely tissue damage and inflammation in the lungs. Our results indicate that MPC/04 replicated to higher levels in the lung, in agreement with its greater ability to cause acute respiratory distress in the mouse. We also provide evidence that these novel MRV strains are pathogenic to mice, leading to lethal respiratory system disease.",

The discovery and characterization of MPC/04 demonstrate the increasing risk posed by unknown animal viruses which are capable of infecting and causing disease in humans. The reovirus provides a rare opportunity to gain insights into possible transmission events and to trace the evolution of masked palm civet viruses. This further highlights the urgent need to systematically survey wild animal borne viruses in the international community so as to enable us to conduct more effective risk assessment, to provide forecast for potential future outbreaks and to devise better prevention and control strategies. Further large-scale studies are necessary to understand the roles of MPC/04 in animal-to-human infection.",
