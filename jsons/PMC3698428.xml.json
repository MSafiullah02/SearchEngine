According to reports issued by the World Health Organization, approximately 5\u201315% of the world\u2019s population is annually infected with influenza A virus, and 250, 000\u2013500, 000 of these infected patients die each year. Annual immunization is the primary means to protect from influenza virus infection, but this vaccination strategy can be limited by the production time (\nBoltz et al. 2010\n). In addition to the vaccination strategy, antiviral therapy is useful to control the spread of influenza. Two classes of antiviral drugs (M2-ion channel inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors) have been approved for the prevention and treatment of influenza (\nBoltz et al. 2010\n;\nvan der Vries et al. 2011\n). However, the effectiveness of these antiviral agents may be limited by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses (\nvan der Vries et al. 2011\n).",

These lung injuries directly correlate with influenza-associated morbidity and mortality because of the impairment of gas exchange and respiratory functions. ARDS is characterized by an increase in the permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier, which is formed by the microvascular endothelium and the alveolar epithelium, leading to an influx of fluid and leukocytes into the alveolar airspace across both the endothelium and the epithelium (\nNunes 2005\n).

These bacterial administrations help to enhance host\u2019s immune response that causes the reduction of the viral replication efficiency and/or upregulation of cytokine expression. Previously, we reported that the water-soluble fraction of lysozyme-treated lactic acid bacterium Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 (LFK) reduces the mortality associated with influenza A virus infections (\nKondoh et al. 2012\n). However, the mechanism underlying the anti-influenza effect of LFK remains unclear. We previously reported that the oral administration of LFK attenuates the eosinophil influx into the upper airway in a murine allergic model (\nZhu et al. 2012\n) and the inflammatory cell influx into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in a murine asthmatic model (\nZhang et al. 2012a\n). These results implied the possibility of anti-inflammatory effect of LFK during influenza virus infection. In this study, we demonstrate that the administration of LFK reduces mortality after H1N1 viral infection and suppresses the excessive influx of leukocytes, which cause inflammatory reactions, into lungs via modulation of the alveolar-capillary permeability.",

In this experiment, the LFK dose was fixed at 15 mg per mouse as previous report in which water-soluble fraction of LFK suspension (15 mg per mouse) was administered to mice (\nKondoh et al. 2012\n). However, in this experiment, LFK suspension rather than water-soluble fraction of LFK was administered for comprehensive understanding of the mechanism for prevention of influenza by LFK. As shown in Figure 1B, 16% of mice in the control group, which were administered saline orally, survived for 17 days post-infection. In contrast, 45% of mice administered LFK orally survived after infection.

This staining revealed that infiltration of leukocytes into the pulmonary parenchyma was suppressed at DPI-7 in the LFK-administered group, whereas infiltration of leukocytes in the pulmonary parenchyma and alveolar collapse were observed in the saline-administered group (Figure 2A and Additional file 1: Figure S1). To confirm that LFK suppresses the infiltration of leukocytes, we homogenized the removed lungs and counted the number of whole lung cells by using a microscope. In the saline-administered group, the number of lung cells increased after viral infection and reached a maximum at DPI-7 (Figure 2B). Unlike in the control group, the number of these cells in the LFK-administered group was significantly suppressed at DPI-5, DPI-7, and DPI-10 (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained for BALF cells. The total cell number in the BALF was suppressed in the LFK-administered group at DPI-5 compared to that in the saline-administered group (Figure 2D).",

In the early phase of infection with influenza virus, innate immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, were recruited to the lung at DPI-5 and DPI-7 (Figure 2C). Thereafter, T cell migration was observed (Figure 2C). However, there was no significant difference between the saline- and LFK-administered groups in the population of the infiltrating cells. A similar result was obtained for the cell population in the BALF at DPI-5. The saline- and LFK-administered groups showed no significant difference in the population of leukocytes that infiltrated the alveolar space (Figure 2E). These results indicate that the suppression of cellular infiltration into the lung occurred in all types of leukocytes that we analyzed.",

MMP-7 expression following viral infection was suppressed in the LFK-administered group at DPI-7 (Figure 4B).

However, administration of the LFK suspension did not markedly upregulate IL-10 expression in this study (Figure 3A). This discrepancy could be due to the differences in composition between administered samples. In this report, LFK suspension was administered to mice, while the supernatant of LFK suspension after centrifuge was used in the previous report (\nKondoh et al. 2012\n). The present study demonstrated that LFK suspension has the ability to neither repress the viral replication, nor enhance the immune system in the lungs (Figures 1C, 3, and Additional file 3: Figure S3). These results indicate that the mechanism by which oral administration of LFK protects against virus-induced death is different from that reported for other probiotic bacteria.",

In Figure S2, we demonstrated that oral administration of LFK increases the number of type II pneumocytes, which act as alveolar epithelial stem cells (\nFehrenbach 2001\n). However, further experiments, such as immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies against proliferation marker and mitogen, are required to clear how the proliferation is induced by LFK. Influenza virus infection against type II pneumocyte causes damage to the alveolar epithelial cells and/or the cell death (\nMatute-Bello et al. 2001\n;\nvan Riel et al. 2007\n;\nLoosli et al. 1975\n). The damage and/or loss result in disturbances in fluidity at the alveolar-capillary border, which is associated with gas exchange inefficiency and pulmonary vascular permeability (\nMura et al. 2010\n;\nWare and Matthay 2000\n;\nMatute-Bello et al. 2001\n). Therefore, the increase in the number of type II pneumocytes in the LFK-administered group suggests that LFK might have the effect of improving respiratory function and epithelial barrier function by the proliferation and/or differentiation of type II pneumocyte during viral infection. Another possibility is that the increase in the number of type II pneumocytes might cause the lower multiplicity of the virus in the virus-infected pneumocyte, which leads to the repression of cell death of type II pneumocyte and successive vascular permeability. However, further analysis of the induction of cell death, proliferation, and differentiation in the type II pneumocyte is required to unmask the role of the increased pneumocyte in LFK-administered mice during the influenza virus infection.",

This is supported by our unpublished data that show that elimination of peptidoglycan from the cell of E. faecalis FK-23 by enzymatic degradation results in loss of the ability to produce various cytokines in ex vivo culture of the splenocytes from mice (data not shown). Increased influx of leukocytes into alveolar space occurs after viral infection, and leukocyte extravasation from the blood to the inflamed tissue is a controlled process involving rolling, adhesion, and migration (\nWeber et al. 2007\n). While CXCL4 shows no chemotactic activity against leukocytes, CXCL4 enhances monocyte adhesion to the endothelium and neutrophil extravasation to the inflamed lung via heterophilic interaction with CCL5 (\nGrommes et al. 2012\n;\nvon Hundelshausen et al. 2005\n;\nKasper and Petersen 2011\n). Therefore, our results suggest that the suppression of leukocyte migration into the lung by the administration of LFK is partially mediated by the downregulation of CXCL4 expression.",

MMP-7 is reported to degrade not only VE-cadherin but also E-cadherin, which are major components of endothelial and epithelial adherens junctions, respectively (\nMcGuire et al. 2003\n;\nIchikawa et al. 2006\n). These adherens junctions act as gatekeepers for the passage of leukocytes during inflammation. Furthermore, stabilization of vascular barrier integrity by upregulating the expression of the VE-cadherin mRNA reduces mortality after H5N1 viral infection and suppresses leukocyte influx into the lung (\nLondon et al. 2010\n). Therefore, our results suggest that downregulation of the expressions of MMP-7 and other MMPs by LFK attenuates not only the breakdown of adherens junctions of alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells, but also degradation of the vascular basement membrane and extracellular matrices. However, further analyses for protein level of MMP and MMP-mediated degradation of target proteins would be required for comprehensive understanding of the effect of LFK for the prevention of influenza.",

Several factors could contribute to the effect of LFK against influenza virus infection. These include the suppression of leukocyte infiltration into the lungs by both the downregulation of CXCL4 expression and the modulation of pulmonary endothelial-epithelial permeability via the increase of type II pneumocytes and the repression of MMPs expression. Our findings support the notion that suppression of the breakdown of the alveolar-capillary barrier and the subsequent leukocyte influx into the lung would improve the survival rate after viral infection.
