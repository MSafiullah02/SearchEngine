            "text": "Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization and death globally. According to the latest available data from the World Health Organization (WHO), lower respiratory tract infection is the fourth most common cause of mortality, causing 3.0 million deaths worldwide in 2016.1 A delay in antibiotic administration can adversely affect the prognosis of pneumonia. Guidelines recommend early initiation of antibiotics in patients with pneumonia as several studies have suggested survival benefit when antibiotics are administered within 4 h of presentation.2, 3, 4 Diagnostic investigations establishing the microbial etiology of pneumonia are essential to ensure the administration of effective antibiotics to the patients.5 However, current therapy is typically initiated on an empirical basis, as even with the best diagnostic methods, a causative pathogen is often not detected in a significant proportion of pneumonia episodes. The Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study reported a pathogen detection rate of 38% in patients who were hospitalized for pneumonia using traditional diagnostic techniques, including standard culture, antigen detection assay, and nucleic acid detection tests.6 Such a low detection yield certainly calls for a more timely and sensitive diagnostic tool in pathogen identification. Nonetheless, differentiating the isolation of true pathogens and coincidental carriage strains in lower respiratory tract infections remains a challenge.7 Over the last few years, molecular investigations have emerged as the diagnostic tool of choice for respiratory pathogens, particularly viruses, owing to its superior sensitivity in detecting organisms that are difficult to isolate, less viable, or present in only small numbers.8 They are also less likely to be affected by prior antibiotic administration than those affected by standard culture methods.9 In addition, molecular diagnostics may provide additional information regarding the presence of antibiotic resistance genes, which may promise better-targeted antimicrobial therapy and improve antibiotic stewardship.",

The target list includes 15 bacteria, 3 atypical bacteria, 8 viruses, and 7 antibiotic resistance genes.

Most of the enrolled subjects were intubated; hence, the specimens were collected from endotracheal aspirates rather than expectorated sputum, which may be contaminated with the normal flora or colonizers from the upper respiratory tract. All the specimens were transported to the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of the Hospital for analysis. The median time from specimen collection to loading into the FilmArray pouch was 1 h and 8 min (range, 12 min to 7 h and 30 min). A chart review was performed to determine the type and duration of antibiotic therapy in each subject. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards and Ethical Committees of the National Taiwan University Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan) [201903009RIND].",

The diagnosis of Legionella infection has been limited by difficulties in its culture and the non-specific nature of serological investigations, which only identifies L. pneumophila serogroup 1 but not the other species and serogroups.23\n,\n24 Most of the discordant results (FilmArray PP positive but culture-negative) in our study were probably caused by antibiotic use prior to sampling. As the nucleic acid of an organism may persist in vivo independent of the organism's viability, the detection of a target does not indicate that the corresponding organisms are the causative agents for the particular clinical symptoms. Likewise, the performance of the FilmArray PP has not been established for monitoring the treatment of infection. Another challenge posed by molecular diagnostics for respiratory pathogens is the difficulty in distinguishing colonization from infection. Though the presence of non-colonizing organisms may suggest disease causation, certain respiratory pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, rhinovirus, or adenovirus may colonize in the upper airway of an asymptomatic individual, and thus, leading to a diagnostic dilemma.5 Quantification of microbial load by molecular methods may provide some clues as isolates with greater quantities are more likely to be clinically significant.9 Defining the true pathogen responsible for the disease is further complicated by the detection of co-infections. In this study, coinfections (both viral-bacterial and multiple bacterial pathogens) were identified in 42.3% of the specimens. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence regarding the incidence and pathogenesis of polymicrobial pneumonia25, 26, 27 and the recent major revelation of the lung microbiome has challenged our traditional paradigm that lungs are sterile and that pneumonia is caused by a single invasive pathogen.28\n,\n29 Future research on pneumonia thus needs to address the conundrum of polymicrobial respiratory disease and its impact on the pathogenesis of pneumonia.29\n",

Multiplex PCR is more likely to have better sensitivity than traditional culture and serological investigation, and thus, leading to difficulties in interpreting the clinical significance of false-positive results.8 Therefore it is inappropriate to consider a positive FilmArray PP result as false-positive when compared to a less-sensitive test.5 The unavailability of an established reference hinders the true estimate of accuracy. Next, the patients enrolled in the study were highly heterogeneous. Patients with various causes of respiratory failure, including community-acquired pneumonia, health-care-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or non-infectious lung disease, who required intubation for ventilatory support, were included in the study. While the respiratory specimens obtained from intubated patients are more representative of the site of infection and are less likely to be contaminated by upper airway flora, the pathogens responsible for each clinical context were different and may not be parts of the targets in the panel. For instance, nosocomial pathogens, such as S. maltophilia, B. cepacia complex, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica,31 might outgrow the common causative bacteria as a result of antibiotic selection, thereby leading to under-detection as they were not included in the panel. Some pathogens, such as Pneumocystis jiroveci and nontuberculous mycobacteria that were also not included in the panel, commonly cause respiratory infections in immunocompromised hosts in Taiwan.32, 33, 34, 35 However, this enables us to understand the application of the FilmArray PP across different patient populations.",
