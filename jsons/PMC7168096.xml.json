However, domestic sex trafficking is happening in communities all over the United States; currently more U.S. citizens are sex trafficking victims within the US than foreign nationals (Hornor, 2015). While not possible to get an accurate number of exploited individuals, estimates suggest sex trafficking to victimize between 100,000 and 300,000 minors in the United States annually (Titchen et al., 2015). The International Labor Organization suggests human trafficking to be a $32 billion per year industry, with twice as many people trafficked today as during the African slave trade (Dovydaitis, 2010). In Seattle, hundreds of people are sold each night for sex; many of them are minors (Real Escape from the Sex Trade, 2015). In a 2014 Arizona State University study, 6,800 unique buyers soliciting sex in the Seattle area were identified on a single web site over a 24\u2010hr period (Real Escape from the Sex Trade, 2017).",

Trafficked individuals have a higher risk of infectious disease because of their poor health status prior to being trafficked, limited access to health care, substandard living conditions, restricted access to hygiene, incomplete childhood vaccinations, and occupational exposure to infected persons (International Organization for Migration, 2009), placing agencies who host them in need of a comprehensive infection control program.",

REST provides guests with a safe place that is tailored to their specific needs and is built on a framework of trauma\u2010informed care (TIC). Such care is focused on the individual and is delivered in a way that acknowledges that past traumas affect current health behaviors and health care decisions. Foundational to TIC is an emphasis on avoiding retraumatization (McNiel, Held, & Busch\u2010Armendariz, 2014). TIC is care that is individualized, non\u2010judgmental, empowering, integrated, holistic and allows for the recipient's self\u2010determination (International Organization for Migration, 2009). This care is rooted in the understanding that without healing, the memories of traumatic life experiences are stored as physiologic reactions that are triggered by stimuli that might seem unrelated to the original experience (Reeves, 2015).",

The lack of such information can frustrate the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of illness (Hom & Woods, 2013). Understanding the fragility of this population is crucial to the development of any program. A hallmark of the trafficked individual's experience while victimized is a lack of control over her body. When providing services to trafficking survivors, the imbalance of power inherent in the service provider\u2013survivor relationship should be addressed to avoid retraumatization over the past abuses of power (Reeves, 2015).",

The REST leadership asked the group to focus their project on the development of an infection control plan. Need for such a plan was a function of recent situations with possible lice, methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections and influenza cases that had spread to staff.

Indeed, an older study of communicable disease transmission in domestic violence shelters found that most shelters were staffed by counselors, with minimal availability of health care workers (Gross & Rosenberg, 1987). Knowing that guests may be reluctant to seek medical care, even when experiencing the relative safety and support while a guest at REST, made it important for staff to understand infection prevention and control measures for everyone's safety.",

Although shelters are not expected to administer health care services in the traditional sense, there is clearly a role in identifying and triaging contagious individuals who require health support as well as in reducing contagious disease transmission within the shelter (Villenave, 2010). In general, service providers are responsible for preventing and controlling infectious diseases processes by using personal protective equipment (PPE), maintaining a clean environment, providing hand sanitizer for staff and guests, along with posting signage in high use areas about hand hygiene practice and cough etiquette (NHCHC, 2016). Infection control challenges identified in temporary shelters include lack of guidelines for service providers, inability of agencies to afford or obtain basic supplies, lack of training regarding basic communicable disease and infection control principles among agency staff, and lack of trained staff to conduct screening of clients prior to agency entry (Leung, Ho, Kiss, Gundlapalli, & Hwang, 2008). Inexpensive preventive measures have been identified to reduce infectious spread: strict handwashing, paper towel dispensers, specific diaper\u2010changing areas, cohorting sick persons, and screening on entry for infectious symptoms to refer for diagnosis and treatment (Gross & Rosenberg, 1987). While REST had many of these needed tools and resources in place, additional support was requested.",

            "text": "Six undergraduate students and one faculty mentor from a baccalaureate nursing program made up the academic team that assisted REST in developing a comprehensive infection control program. The Service Learning course paired small groups of senior students in their final quarter of nursing school with nonprofit agencies serving marginalized populations where, over the 10\u2010week partnership, students developed an evidence\u2010based, sustainable project of the agency's choosing. The REST staff asked the team to develop a plan that would keep both themselves, the shelter and drop\u2010in guests healthy by reducing the spread of infections. Because infectious diseases can be highly stigmatizing in this population, the students\u2019 goal was to design an infection control program that allowed for the sensitive treatment of guests (International Organization for Migration, 2009). A hospital\u2010like, isolation\u2010based infection control program would not work for the guests of the REST shelter, as it could easily be viewed as judgmental. Traditional isolation practices, while they may limit the spread of infection, were too clinical for the REST staff and seemed to be in opposition to a trauma\u2010informed model. As Reeves (2015) so eloquently stated, \u201cTrauma\u2010informed care requires constant analysis of the health benefits versus the emotional costs of continuing health care procedures or health\u2010promoting behaviors\u201d (p. 702).",

The team expanded the list following a comprehensive review of the literature and divided the infectious diseases into categories based on affected body systems or mode of transmission; the list was narrowed following team discussion around mode of transmission and likeliness of occurrence within the shelter environment. The team intentionally excluded diseases transmitted solely through sexual contact as the focus was on illnesses that could be spread by individuals who were following the shelter guidelines (no sexual contact was permitted inside the shelter). A final list of 31 infectious illnesses was transferred into a table format describing the technical and common disease names, mode of transmission, prevention techniques, symptoms, infectious period, treatment options, and special considerations. As much as possible, all information included in the IDIT used layman terminology. For a complete list of the included infections, see Figure 2.",

The curriculum for this session included the chain of infection concept, disease transmission methods, proper hand hygiene practices, environmental hygiene guidelines, safe handling of food, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), how to use the Abscess Kits, and the importance of flu vaccinations.

            "text": "Nurses play a vital role in developing population\u2010based interventions for the health of the community. Prevention of infection is an important nursing outcome. Nonprofit organizations without a nurse on staff can benefit from innovative partnerships with nurses in academia, governmental agencies, or by recruiting nurses to serve as volunteers. The partnership between a nonprofit serving trafficked women and a small group of baccalaureate nursing students was successful for a mutually beneficial Service Learning project. The team of students experienced working with a vulnerable population and translating evidence into a sustainable intervention. Students learned new skills as this population\u2010based nursing intervention was developed while keeping in mind the delicate balance between infection control principles and trauma\u2010informed care. The community agency received education and tools to keep their guests, staff, and volunteers safer from the spread of infection. Such partnerships are an effective way to meet baccalaureate nursing learning objectives in a way meaningful for students and to engage the local community with higher education.",
