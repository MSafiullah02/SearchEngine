Depending on which role the agent is acting in when it sends/receives messages, the sequence diagram shows arrows to/from a particular lifeline for the agent. We illustrate a system that has four agents. The first agent is called Interface agent. The user initially specifies the disease that they want information about by sending a 'Specify Disease' message to the Interface agent. The agent confirms that this message has been received. The next step is that the user specifies their specific interest in the disease. That is, do they want information about disease types, causes, symptoms or treatments? Again, the Interface agent confirms that this message has been received. Once the Interface agent builds a SHDO template (called a Specific Human Disease Ontology Template) using Generic Human Disease Ontology, there is a structure established which can later be filled out with data. For example, the user may specify that they want information about Diabetes, and only on causes and symptoms, not treatments.",

This is the reason why the ontology can be used to represent domain knowledge as well as the task structure.

Because the Manager agent knows exactly which Information agent is appropriate for the execution of a particular task, tasks are allocated to different Information agents. In Figure 11 .4, we show an example where four different types of Information agents exist. Each agent is responsible for retrieving information on a specific topic, namely, on disease types, symptoms, causes or treatments. The directed contract is then established between Manager and Information agents. One Information agent is also aware of tasks assigned to other Information agents.

As GHDO has a hierarchical structure, we believe that a multi-agent system based on this ontology functions best when forming itself a hierarchy of agents corresponding to the four different ontology branches. We propose a GHDO-based Holonic Multi-agent Structure (GHMS) (Hadzic et al. 2006 ) as a nested hierarchy of four holarchies in which each of the four GHDO dimensions (Disease types, Symptoms, Causes and Treatments) is associated with one holarchy (see Figure 11 .5). Highest in the agent hierarchy is the Disease Mediator Agent. For each of the four holarchies, we have corresponding Mediator, Specialist and Representative Agents. The information is interpreted and analyzed at the higher levels of the hierarchy while collection of the data happens at the lower level holarchy. ",

Covering as much as possible of the information requested by different users, the latest version of the SHDO regarding a particular disease is saved in the history files module.

If the difference is consistent, the new SHDO should be used to update the corresponding part of SHDO file. In Figure 11 .7, 'f' needed to be replaced by 'l'. This latest version of the SHDO is stored in the history file module and used next time for matching. We call this kind of SHDO update an 'update own files' update.

This helps to sort out the exact combinations of genetic and environmental factors involved, as well as their individual influences on a specific complex disease type.

For each disease, there is a corresponding phenotype or observable characteristics of an ill individual, namely the symptoms of a disease. Each disease is caused by factors(s) which can be genetic (genotype), environmental, or caused by a microorganism. Information about the genetic causes of a disease can be about a mutated gene, a complex of genes or a DNA region of interest. A DNA region of interest is a region in the DNA sequence that potentially contains a gene responsible for the disease. This region needs to be further examined in order to correctly locate the mutated gene. Environmental causes of a disease can be stress, climate, drugs or family conditions. Microorganisms that may cause a disease may be viruses or bacteria. Possible treatments for a disease can be drug therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, psychotherapy or physiotherapy.The four different branches (subontologies) of the GHDO ontology can serve as a reference point against which the concepts from the existing medical ontologies can be reorganized, aligned and merged.",
