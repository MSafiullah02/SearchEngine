This screening process evolved over time as more information about the virus became available and national recommendations changed. It began with limiting access for individuals who had recently travelled to China. Screening was then expanded to include individuals who either had a personal travel history or had been in contact with persons who had recently travelled to China, Italy, or Iran. Initially, screening only occurred in areas containing our most susceptible patients \u2013 the ICU and oncology wing. This transitioned to our current practice of closing all entrances except two, where all entering individuals are required to have their temperature checked via an infrared thermometer and answer a screening questionnaire. Those with temperatures above a designated cutoff undergo a medical workup and are not allowed into patient areas. Visitation has been incrementally restricted to only allow visitors under exceptional circumstances.",

For instance, on the surgical service, only one resident may enter the patient\u2019s room during morning rounds. Meanwhile, patient evaluations performed as part of surgical consultations are carried out by the senior resident alone. This limits the number of residents each patient is exposed to, and vice versa.

Therefore, our organization has significantly limited the number of in-person clinic visits. Annual physicals, routine screenings, and immunizations have been postponed. Long term, this may be detrimental to patient care and the patient-provider relationship. One means to mediate this impact is through expansion of telehealth. In the past, only post-operative virtual visits were reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid. However, with the recent approval for telehealth expansion by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, our organization began utilizing telehealth during routine office visits, as well as uncomplicated post-operative visits and certain new patient encounters. It is our hope that a substantial portion of outpatient care may continue via this mechanism. At present, we have 252 providers actively performing remote office visits with a total of 415 now having access to the platform. This is compared with only 12 providers previously utilizing the telehealth system (Figure 1 and 2\n). This remarkable increase in telehealth providers was accomplished within 10 days, and activity is expected to markedly grow in the coming weeks.",

Therefore, the need arose to supplement their clinical experience with alternative forms of education. We are currently developing new curricula for these students that attempts to mimic the clinical environment. One such addition includes the development of surgical cases for medical students that contain patient encounters spanning from office visits, to pre-operative testing, intra-operative decision making, inpatient post-operative care, and outpatient follow up.

Our service area has a population density of 77 individuals per square mile. These individuals are spread across a 10,000 square mile region. Although this aids in decreasing the rapidity of COVID-19 spread, it presents challenges regarding ease of access to our healthcare system. The systemwide adoption of a virtual platform has aided us in reaching our most rural patients and alleviated some of the burden of limited healthcare access within the more remote regions of our service area.",

Given the rural service area and patient population of our hospital, the expectation that we will reach the entirety of our workforce and patients is optimistic at best. According to one report by the Federal Communications Commission, 35% of rural Americans lack access to high-speed broadband internet compared to 3% of urban Americans 16. Therefore, we should be cautious in transitioning to a healthcare system that is overly reliant on remote communication before basic internet access is established for all Americans. Otherwise we run the risk of dangerously excluding a sizable proportion of citizens.",
