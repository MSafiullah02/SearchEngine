Generalized estimating equations adjusted for the correlation of participants within a swine facility and within participants over time. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to adjust the complete case analysis for possible biases arising from losses to follow-up.

Conversely, higher odds of seroconversion against swine H3N2 virus were observed among the unexposed (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.43\u20133.60) and CAFO-exposed (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.11\u20133.42), when compared to the non-CAFO swine workers; the unexposed participants had higher geometric mean MN titers, compared to the other 2 groups, for all time points (Table 3). There was no correlation between years of swine exposure and seroconversion against swine H1N1 at enrollment, and no differences in this relationship by enrollment site type. A negative correlation was observed between years of swine exposure and seroconversion against swine H3N2 after enrollment (Spearman \u03c1 = \u22120.11, 95% CI \u2212.20 to \u2212.02). Among CAFO swine workers, the Spearman correlation for seroconversion against swine H3N2 was \u22120.01 (95% CI \u2212.20 to .18); however, among non-CAFO swine workers, the Spearman correlation for the same outcome was \u22120.14 (95% CI \u2212.24 to \u2212.04).",

Though the number of reported ILI events (n = 15) was too low to perform statistical analyses, more ILI events were observed among the swine-exposed than -unexposed participants during the study period. These exposed participants worked at enrollment sites with higher average numbers of pigs housed per day, compared to exposed participants who did not experience an ILI. Along this line, we further stratified the exposed group into CAFO and non-CAFO workers, assuming that individuals working at CAFOs have more intense exposure to large populations of pigs. Here, we observed conflicting results, with no significant association with seroconversion against swine H1N1 by enrollment site type and increased odds of seroconversion against swine H3N2 among unexposed participants. We hypothesized that some of this effect for swine H3N2 might have been due to cross-reactivity with this human subtype, and this was supported by the subset of sera samples we tested that demonstrated higher odds of seroconversion against human H3N2 if the participant had also seroconverted against swine H3N2, a trend that was not observed for H1N1. Finally, the complete case analysis we conducted among 187 participants followed through 24 months demonstrated results more consistent with previous literature [7, 13\u201316].",

While exposed participants were not found to be at a higher risk of seroconversion against swine H3N2 virus, the ORs trended in that direction, and we present evidence that suggests some of this effect may be due to cross-reactivity with the seasonal H3N2 virus in humans.",

First, our primary outcome measure, by definition, required a minimum of 2 follow-up measurements; therefore, participants observed only at enrollment could not contribute to an analysis of seroconversion. Participants observed at only 2 time points are similarly less likely to have a seroconversion event, since individuals with 3 time points have more opportunities to seroconvert. Further, we observed systematic differences in demographic- and exposure-related characteristics between participants who dropped out, participants who remained in the study, and participants recruited as replacement subjects at subsequent time points. Overcoming these issues would require strict assumptions about the missing data mechanisms (eg, multiple imputation), which we did not feel were tenable. Thus, we opted for a pragmatic approach, reporting the complete case analyses as our primary models, with sensitivity analyses using IPW.",

While some of this risk of seroconversion against swine H3N2 could likely be explained by cross-reactivity against human H3N2 IAV, these data support the premise that persons with intense occupational exposure to pigs are at high risk (ORs ranging from 17\u201320, depending upon the occupational comparison group) of infection with enzootic swine viruses.
