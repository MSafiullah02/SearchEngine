High mutation rates in RNA viruses generate extensive opportunities to overcome evolutionary hurdles, such as antiviral drugs, host immunity, or engineered attenuating changes (1). The evolutionary pathways traversed by RNA viruses are shaped by natural selection, which will favor some evolutionary trajectories more than others based on whether mutations are beneficial, deleterious, or neutral (2). Predicting the likely results of RNA virus evolution is an important step for anticipating viral emergence and for developing escape-resistant antiviral drugs and vaccines (3, 4).",

All CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is critical for replication, fidelity, fitness, and virulence, and ExoN inactivation has been proposed as a strategy for live attenuated vaccine development (6\u201315). As members of the DEDDh superfamily of exonucleases, CoV ExoNs hydrolyze nucleotides using four metal-coordinating amino acids arranged in three motifs: I (DE), II (E), and III (D) (16, 17). Alanine substitution in ExoN motif I (DE-to-AA) disrupts ExoN biochemical activity in both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and human CoV 229E (hCoV-229E) (16, 18, 19). The betacoronaviruses murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV tolerate disruption of ExoN activity [ExoN(\u2212)] but display mutator phenotypes accompanied by defects in replication, competitive fitness, and evasion of innate immune responses (10, 13, 14). ExoN active-site mutants in alphacoronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus and hCoV-229E, have yet to be recovered and are proposed to be lethal for replication (19, 20).",

In line with this expectation, ExoN motif III mutants of SARS-CoV and MHV rapidly and repeatedly revert (14; also our unpublished observations). In contrast, we have never detected partial or complete reversion of ExoN motif I mutants (ExoN-AA) in SARS-CoV or MHV during 10 years of study and hundreds of experiments. More specifically, we have not detected consensus or minority variants of any kind at the motif I AA codons in either virus strain during acute infections and prolonged passage in tissue culture and following treatment with multiple nucleoside analogues (6\u201311, 13, 14). SARS-CoV-ExoN-AA also is stable during acute and persistent animal infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice (12). The lack of primary reversion is not due simply to reduced adaptive capacity, as both SARS-CoV-ExoN-AA and MHV-ExoN-AA can adapt for increased replication (7, 14). Most strikingly, long-term passage of MHV-ExoN-AA (250 passages [P250]) yielded a highly fit population that had directly compensated for defective proofreading through evolution of a likely high-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (7). Yet where primary reversion would have required just four total consensus mutations, MHV-ExoN-AA-P250 contained more than 170.",

            "text": "MHV-ExoN(\u2013), here ExoN-AA, contains two engineered substitutions in each codon of motif I, such that complete reversion to WT-ExoN-DE requires mutations to all four sites (Fig. 1A). Viral mutation rates in the absence of proofreading range from 10\u22124 to 10\u22126 mutations per nucleotide per round of replication (\u03bc) (1). Assuming an ExoN-AA mutation rate of 10\u22124 \u03bc and accounting for codon degeneracy, the probability of restoring the native amino acid sequence in a single round of replication is 10\u221218. Only rarely do ExoN-AA titers exceed 106 PFU/ml, so it is unlikely that ExoN-AA could navigate this genetic barrier in a single infectious cycle. Thus, we hypothesized that ExoN-AA reversion, if possible, would proceed incrementally. To identify potential pathways toward ExoN-AA reversion, we examined the possible single-nucleotide substitutions surrounding A89 and A91 (Fig. 1B). Three mutations are synonymous, and five mutations yield amino acids unlikely to coordinate with the positively charged metals required for ExoN catalysis (glycine, valine, proline, threonine, and serine) (16, 19, 22, 23). One mutation per site can restore the acidic charge (i.e., AA-to-ED) but not the native amino acid. These variants have not been tested in a CoV ExoN, but biochemical studies of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I ExoN mutants suggest that these conservative substitutions would not restore WT-like ExoN activity (24). We predicted stepwise pathways to ExoN-AA\u2192DE reversion based on restoration of acidic charge, followed by reversion to native amino acids (Fig. 1C). We engineered and recovered variants in ExoN-AA requiring three mutations (3 nucleotides [nt]; ExoN-AD and ExoN-EA), two mutations (2 nt; ExoN-DA, ExoN-ED, and ExoN-AE), or one mutation (1 nt; ExoN-DD and ExoN-EE) for reversion to WT-ExoN-DE (Table 1). We will here refer to these mutants as intermediate revertants. All intermediate revertants generated viable progeny during recovery, demonstrating that reversion to WT-ExoN-DE along these pathways is theoretically possible. The 3-nt and 2-nt mutants were genetically stable during recovery, as confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. However, both 1-nt mutants (ExoN-DD and ExoN-EE) reverted to WT-ExoN-DE during three independent recovery attempts, suggesting that these two variants are less fit than WT-ExoN-DE and demonstrating that reversion by a 1-nt mutation is readily accessible. To test whether the 3-nt or 2-nt mutants would revert more rapidly than ExoN-AA (4 nt), we passaged three lineages of each mutant 10 times at multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 0.5 and 0.01 PFU/cell. We harvested supernatants and screened for reversion by visual inspection of plaque phenotypes at each passage. WT-ExoN-DE and WT-like viruses produce uniform, large plaques, while ExoN-AA-like viruses yield small, variably sized plaques (13). When we observed mixed plaque phenotypes, we sequenced three large plaques from each lineage to confirm reversion. The 3-nt (ExoN-AD and ExoN-EA) and 2-nt (ExoN-DA and ExoN-ED) intermediate revertants showed no evidence of reversion over 10 passages at either MOI (Table 1). In contrast, the 2-nt ExoN-AE contained WT revertants by P2 in all lineages at an MOI of 0.5 PFU/cell and in one lineage by P8 at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell. Once observed, WT revertants dominated the ExoN-AE population for the remaining passages. These data indicate that at least one 2-nt mutation pathway can lead to full reversion in tissue culture. The probability of ExoN-AE arising during a single infectious cycle of ExoN-AA is low but theoretically achievable (\u223c10\u22129), so ExoN-AA could conceivably revert within just two infectious cycles. However, complete reversion has never been observed even during prolonged passage or persistent infections, suggesting that additional barriers to the replication, fitness, or maintenance of intermediate revertants exist.",

            "text": "Because the intermediate revertants are viable as recombinants but are not found in ExoN-AA populations, we hypothesized that they confer no selective advantage over ExoN-AA (8, 9, 13). To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed replication of the 3-nt and 2-nt intermediate revertants (Fig. 2A). All variants achieved peak titers similar to the titer of ExoN-AA, but detailed examination of their kinetics suggested a potential delay of up to 1.5 h for all intermediate revertants compared to the kinetics of ExoN-AA. Of note, ExoN-AE was the most delayed, and we detected WT-ExoN-DE revertants in two of three replicates, suggesting increased selective pressure against this variant. We next measured the competitive fitness of each intermediate revertant relative to a recombinant ExoN-AA containing seven silent mutations in the nsp2 coding region (ExoN-AA-reference). Intermediate revertants were mixed with an equal titer of ExoN-AA-reference at a combined MOI of 0.05 PFU/cell and passaged four times. The ratio of each intermediate revertant to ExoN-AA-reference was quantified at each passage by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and the change in ratio over time was used to calculate their relative fitness levels. WT-ExoN-DE was significantly more fit than ExoN-AA, whereas the intermediate revertants (ExoN-AD, -EA, -DA, and -ED) had no increased fitness relative to that of ExoN-AA (Fig. 2B). The apparent increased fitness of ExoN-AE resulted from all lineages reverting to WT-ExoN-DE during the experiment. Finally, our previous studies have shown that adaptation of ExoN-AA includes partial compensation for the replication fidelity defect, as measured by reduced susceptibility to the mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (7\u201311, 25). None of the intermediate variants demonstrated statistically significant differences in 5-FU sensitivity compared to that of ExoN-AA (Fig. 2C). Thus, with the exception of the ExoN-AE\u2192DE revertants, no 3-nt and 2-nt intermediate genotypes along our predicted pathway demonstrated an advantage in replication, fitness, or fidelity that would favor their maintenance or expansion in the viral population. Thus, natural selection is unlikely to drive ExoN-AA down these pathways toward reversion.",

We have previously demonstrated that during 250 passages (P250), ExoN-AA can adapt for increased replication, fitness, and fidelity via secondary mutations outside motif I (7). We tested whether secondary adaptive mutations could exceed the fitness of ExoN-AA and its intermediate revertants. To examine the early adaptation of ExoN-AA, we studied passage 10 from the P250 passage series (Fig. 3). ExoN-AA-P10 retains the ExoN-AA motif I genotype but has increased replication and reduced susceptibility to 5-FU, altogether manifesting greater relative fitness (Fig. 3) (7). We identified only six total mutations within ExoN-AA-P10 by dideoxy sequencing (Table 2), indicating that rapid adaptation of and compensation for ExoN-AA requires relatively few genetic changes at the consensus level. To test whether interactions between multiple mutations or population level effects contribute to ExoN-AA-P10 fitness, we isolated a plaque-purified clone of ExoN-AA-P10. The clone replicated to higher titers than the ExoN-AA-P10 population but had identical 5-FU sensitivity and relative fitness levels (Fig. 3), indicating that genomes derived from a single virus plaque encode the adaptive changes required by the total population. Together, these data demonstrate that mutations outside ExoN(\u2013) motif I can confer greater fitness advantages than intermediate revertants even at early passages. These early adaptive mutations likely reduce the selective pressure for motif I reversion and place the intermediate revertants at a selective disadvantage.",

In addition to reducing selective pressure for reversion, mutations conferring increased fitness to ExoN-AA might also reduce the benefits of motif I reversion. We previously reported that long-term passage (P250) of ExoN-AA selects for secondary adaptive mutations in the nsp12 RdRp and nsp14 (nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250) (7). nsp12-P250 contains seven nonsynonymous mutations that partially compensate for defective proofreading and increase ExoN-AA fitness. nsp14-P250 contains six nonsynonymous mutations, including a conservative D-to-E substitution in ExoN motif III, and increases ExoN-AA fitness without compensating for defective proofreading. To test whether the fitness effects of passage-associated mutations in nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250 depend upon the ExoN-AA genotype, we engineered a WT motif I (ExoN-DE) into viruses containing nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250, alone and together, and analyzed replication, 5-FU sensitivity, and competitive fitness. Compared to WT-ExoN-DE, both ExoN-DE-nsp12-P250 and ExoN-DE-nsp14-P250 displayed delayed and decreased replication (Fig. 4A). In 5-FU sensitivity assays, ExoN-DE-nsp14-P250 was indistinguishable from WT-ExoN-DE, while both variants containing nsp12-P250 (ExoN-DE-nsp12-P250 and ExoN-DE-nsp12/14-P250) were significantly more sensitive to 5-FU (Fig. 4B). Finally, the nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250 mutations significantly decreased fitness relative to that of WT-ExoN-DE (Fig. 4C). We detected no statistical differences between the specific infectivity of WT-ExoN-DE and that of any of the nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250 variants in isolated infections (Fig. 4D). Thus, mutations in nsp12 and nsp14 that arose in the ExoN-AA background were detrimental to replication, mutagen sensitivity, and competitive fitness in the presence of a fully reverted ExoN-DE. These results support the conclusion that the adaptive pathways available to ExoN-AA may stabilize the ExoN-AA genotype, reducing both the selective pressure for, and the potential benefits of, primary reversion.",

Our results support a model in which the viable adaptive pathways leading to direct reversion of motif I from AA to DE are relatively flat on a fitness landscape, with intermediate revertants remaining phenotypically ExoN(\u2013) and conferring no fitness advantage over ExoN-AA. In contrast, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is readily accessible and imparts immediate fitness gains over ExoN-AA. We propose that even minimal alternative pathway-adaptive fitness gains reduce the likelihood and benefits of motif I reversion until eventually the changing genetic background renders reversion detrimental. These data and this model suggest that selection during replication favors immediate, incremental fitness gains along the most accessible pathway rather than dramatic fitness increases across a larger genetic barrier. While this study focused on the issue of primary ExoN-AA reversion, it raises intriguing questions about the remaining topography of the ExoN-AA fitness landscape. Ongoing studies in our laboratory will determine whether ExoN-AA-P10 (and P250) represents a conserved pathway to compensate for defective proofreading or if CoV genomes accommodate multiple solutions to ExoN(\u2013)-associated debilitations. Supporting the possibility of limited potential pathways, a recent study of vaccine-derived polioviruses determined that evolution for virulence in parallel epidemics proceeded through a limited set of genetic changes rather than a plethora of distinct trajectories (4).",

            "text": "A key finding of this study is that mutations compensating for ExoN-AA are detrimental to WT-ExoN-DE, yet the mechanisms underlying this disparity are not clear. We expected that compensatory mutations in nsp14-P250 would hobble WT-ExoN-DE by inducing structural changes in the active site. However, the replication and fitness defects observed in ExoN-DE viruses containing nsp14-P250 were not associated with altered proofreading, as measured by 5-FU sensitivity (Fig. 4). In fact, the nsp14-P250 mutations do not substantially affect 5-FU sensitivity in either the ExoN-AA or WT-ExoN-DE background (7), suggesting that these mutations enhance some other stage of the MHV replication cycle, perhaps through interactions with other replicase proteins or with viral RNA. If so, these results imply that the proteins of the MHV replication holoenzyme must evolve in a highly cooperative manner to compensate for defective proofreading while also maintaining their intricate and intimate functional relationships. In line with this hypothesis, the likely high-fidelity nsp12-P250 disrupted replication, 5-FU resistance, and fitness in the presence of an intact ExoN-DE catalytic motif. Given the inverse relationship between polymerase fidelity and replication speed (the slower the polymerase proceeds, the more time it has to discriminate incoming nucleotides) (29\u201332), nsp12-P250 could fracture the delicate kinetic balance between polymerization and nsp14-ExoN-mediated excision during replication. Support for this hypothesis comes from a recent study establishing that the SARS-CoV-nsp12 replicates with lower fidelity than the RdRp of dengue virus and from the observation that the likely high-fidelity RdRp variant MHV-nsp12-V553I delays replication of proofreading-capable MHV (9, 33). As with nsp14-P250, nsp12-P250 mutations could have additional effects on RdRp functions or protein-protein interactions that are incompatible with an active ExoN domain. Finally, it is possible that the adaptive mutations in nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250, including synonymous changes, could modify RNA sequence features or secondary structures in ways that interfere with WT-ExoN-DE. Defining the molecular interactions underlying the strain specificity of ExoN-AA-compensatory mutations using recombinant viruses or reconstituted biochemical systems will provide a unique opportunity to explore the complex evolutionary and functional relationships that underpin the coronavirus replication machinery.",

            "text": "Our results also extend existing studies of CoV ExoN motif I. Motif I DE\u2192AA mutations in the SARS-CoV nsp14-ExoN dramatically reduce nuclease activity in biochemical assays, but no study has examined the contributions of each residue independently (16, 18). While we cannot exclude the possibility that intermediate revertants of ExoN-AA retain some level of nucleolytic activity, the lack of consistent or statistical differences in replication, 5-FU sensitivity, or competitive fitness relative to levels for ExoN-AA supports previous studies demonstrating that motif I DE is essential for ExoN function (16, 18, 19). Given these results, we were surprised to observe repeated reversion of the ExoN-AE but not the other two 2-nt variants, ExoN-DA and ExoN-ED. One potential explanation is that the specific mutational bias of ExoN-AE makes the revertant mutations more accessible than in ExoN-DA or ExoN-ED. Alternatively, if ExoN-AE has profound replication or fitness defects, selection could drive primary reversion more quickly away from this genotype. Consistent with this hypothesis, ExoN-AE reverted more quickly at a higher MOI, where natural selection acts more efficiently on a larger population size (Table 1) (34). Biochemical studies of the ExoN-AA intermediate revertants will be valuable to determine whether nsp14-ExoN-AE differs from the other intermediate revertants and to define the structural and kinetic features of nsp14-ExoN catalysis.",

            "text": "ExoN-AA-reference and WT-ExoN-DE-reference viruses were marked with seven consecutive silent mutations within nsp2 (wild type, 1301-TTCGTCC-1307; reference, 1301-CAGCAGC-1307) by round-the-horn PCR, as described above. Competitions were performed in triplicate on DBT-9 cells in 12-well plates, plated at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells per well 24 h prior to infection. Cells were infected at a total MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell (MOI of 0.05 PFU/cell each for competitor and reference virus). Supernatants were harvested at 15 and 16 h postinfection for experiments with ExoN-AA-reference and WT-ExoN-DE-reference, respectively, and passaged four times. Titers of samples were determined between all passages to maintain a total MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. RNA was extracted from 70 \u03bcl of supernatant using a QIAamp 96 virus QIAcube HT kit on a QIAcube HT System (Qiagen). Each RNA sample was analyzed by one-step RT-qPCR with two SYBR green assays. Reference viruses were detected with forward primer SS-qPCR-Sil-F (5\u2032-CTATGCTGTATACGGACAGCAGT-3\u2032; 200 nM final concentration) and reverse primer SS-qPCR-R2 (5\u2032-GGTGTCACCACAACAATCCAC-3\u2032; 200 nM final concentration). Competitors were detected with forward primer SS-qPCR-WT-F (5\u2032-CTATGCTGTATACGGATTCGTCC-3\u2032, 450 nM final concentration) and reverse primer SS-qPCR-R2 (5\u2032-GGTGTCACCACAACAATCCAC-3\u2032, 450 nM final concentration). RNA samples were diluted 1:100 prior to RT-qPCR with a Power SYBR green RNA-to-Ct 1-step kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Duplicate wells were averaged, and values were excluded from subsequent analysis if the duplicate wells differed by >0.5 threshold cycle (CT). The relative abundances of competitor and reference were determined by subtracting CT values (\u0394CT\ncompetitor = CT\ncompetitor \u2013 CT\nreference) and converted to reflect the fold change in the ratio (\u0394ratio = 2\u2212\u0394\nCT\ncompetitor). The log10(\u0394ratio) was plotted against passage number, and the change in log10(\u0394ratio) (i.e., slope of linear regression) is the relative fitness. Note that regressions were fit only for P1 to P4 as slight deviations in the 1:1 ratio in the input (P0) can skew the slope.",
