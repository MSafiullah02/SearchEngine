Such plant viruses should replicate to high levels in infected plant tissues, be readily purified, be stable in viuo and in uitro, and be sufficiently characterized both genetically and structurally to allow for directed molecular modifications. Viruses that have been used specifically to produce vaccine epitopes include tobacco mosaic tobarnovirus (TMV), cowpea mosaic comovirus (CPMV), and johnsongrass mosaic potyvirus (JMV). Discussion in this paper is limited to generic modification of replicating viruses that lead to production and accumulation of virions that display unique sequences on the surface of the virus particle.",

Injecting the assembled protein subunits of TMV to mice caused production of antibody against the poliovirus epitope.' Recently a similar approach was taken with JMV to demonstrate that the coat protein of this potyvirus could assemble to form virus-like particles in E . coli when up to 26 kD of foreign protein sequences were added to, or replaced, the amino terminal sequence of the coat protein. * Recently there have been a number of reports on the construction of cloned cDNAs that represent the full-length genome(s) of viral RNAs from which infectious viral RNAs can be transcribed in uitro. The infectious cloned cDNAs (the term used to describe such constructs) of several plant viruses have been subjected to in uitro mutagenesis so that they encode modified coat proteins during virus replication, including proteins that can serve as immunogenic epitopes. Furthermore, knowledge of the crystal structures of TMV and CPMV makes it possible to predict the impact of foreign sequences on capsid and virion structures. These advances allow the design of strategies to develop these viruses as delivery vehicles for vaccine epitopes.",

Such an infection would produce virions comprised of both types of CP while limiting the infection by the virus that produces wild-type CP; furthermore, in those cases in which the epitope prevented efficient local and/or system infection, sufficient levels of wild-type CP accumulate to ensure spread of the infection (as demonstrated in FIG. 2) .

TABLE 1 presents the results of some studies of sequences that were added as COOH-terminal extensions of the CP or between amino acids 154 and 155.

As shown in FIGURE 2 SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteins extracted from leaves infected with TMV in which the coat protein is modified by insertion of nucleotides that encode the 9 amino acid sequence derived from the hemagglutinin of influenza virus revealed a prominent protein band representing the modified coat protein (lanes 2 , 3, 4, and 5).

Like TMV, the NH,-and COOH-termini of the CP are exposed on the surface of the virus particle: the exposed amino terminal amino acid sequence can be greater than 30 amino acids. A single report describes the results of studies with sequences fused to coat proteins of johnsongrass mosaic potyvirus (JMV).2 Fusion proteins were made at the amino terminus of the CP of JMV with an octapeptide derived from Plasmodium jalciparum or the 10 amino acid luteinizing hormone releasing factor. In another construct, the 26-kD protein Sj-26-glutathione S-transferase from Shistosoma ,japonica replaced 62 amino acids at the NH,terminus of the CP. Fusion proteins comprising the CP plus added sequences accumulated in E . coli and assembled to form virus-like particles. Injection of the Sj-26: CP fusion to mice elicited antibody response to Sj-26. These studies demonstrate the capacity of modified potyvirus CP to assemble to form virus-like particles (VLP), including very large proteins.
