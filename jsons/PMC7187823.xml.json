Viruses contribute to 30\u201370% of acute respiratory infections.1\n,\n2 Influenza viruses are one of the leading causes of respiratory infections, with an annual global attack rate of about 5\u201310% in adults and 20\u201330% in children3 and it is known to cause severe respiratory illness and death in high-risk individuals. Although anti-influenza drugs and vaccines are available, due to the continuous antigenic variations (in the form of drifts and shifts), this virus can lead to yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics; hence influenza remains a global threat. The next common virus associated with significant hospitalization and respiratory distress, particularly in children, is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nearly 70% of children are infected with RSV by the age of 1 year.4 Other common viruses are parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, measles, adenoviruses and bocavirus. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority as they mostly cause self-limiting disease and no specific antiviral drugs are available (except for influenza and RSV). However, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value.",

Patients (both children and adults) who are residents of Union territory of Puducherry attending the outpatient care facilities of our hospital with symptoms of ILI or ARI and inpatients admitted for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) were included in the study. Patients with a history of ARI/ILI in the preceding 30 days were excluded. Sample size was calculated using OpenEpi version 3.03a (Frequency of outcome factor to be 30% & absolute precision of 5% and CI of 99.9%) and 648 patients were included in the study. Patient information including age, gender, clinical presentation, underlying conditions, outcome, travel and treatment details were recorded using a structured proforma.

Most identical nucleotide sequences available in the sequence database were identified through NCBI BLAST program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

No Indian study has analyzed HCoV-229E virus and the strains isolated from this study were genetically similar to strains reported from Germany, Malaysia, Japan and Netherlands (Fig. 12\n). Similarly, no study from India has analyzed the genetic sequence HCoV-OC43 and single isolate sequenced in our study showed a close relationship with a strain from the United Kingdom and the United States (Fig. 13\n). The measles strains were of genotype D8 and closed circulation of measles strains between Pondicherry and other parts of the neighboring state, Tamil Nadu was observed. These strains were distinct from measles strains of Spain, Moscow, South Africa and it formed a separate subgroup along with other Indian strains (Fig. 14\n). Human bocavirus strains of this study were not closely related to other Indian strains, particularly one isolate, KR376140, isolated in 2012 showed a distinct lineage (Fig. 15\n).",

This has been well demonstrated in the pathogenesis of influenza and RSV infection39\n,\n40 and it is emphasized to collect samples in the first 3 days of symptoms onset. This study finding also suggests the importance of sample collection within 3 days of symptoms onset to achieve the maximum viral detection rate. Apart from the timing, the other important aspect of sample collection is the type of sample collected. In this study, we used nasopharyngeal sample collected using flocked nylon swabs, which have been shown to have excellent sensitivity when compared to rayon swabs, and is considered as an alternative to nasopharyngeal aspirate sampling.41\n,\n42\n",
