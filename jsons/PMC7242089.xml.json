The full-face snorkel mask has 2 separate compartments: an upper for viewing and a lower sealed breathing compartment to ensure that the visor remains clear during expiration. The airway breathing filter (Ultipor 25; PALL Life Sciences, Port Washington, NY) was selected because it is known to prevent contamination of the components of the anesthesia machine (Figure 2 [lower]).2,3 After removing the snorkel from the snorkel fitting, the airway filter was affixed over the fitting using an occlusive dressing to circumferentially seal the interface airtight (Figure 3). The airway filter (outer diameter 25 mm) could fit within the snorkel fitting (inner diameter 25.5 mm) except for the presence of 2 thin plastic baffles within the fitting. These baffles divide the lumen of the snorkel fitting into 3 channels: a central channel for inspiration and 2 outer channels for expiration (Figure 2 [upper]). The baffles can be cut to accommodate the filter, but we chose not to do so.",

Full-face snorkel masks channel inspiration and expiration through separate passageways within the facemask, with the exhaled breath directed from the breathing compartment into 2 lateral channels. With minimal or no exertion as in surface snorkeling, there is no perceived resistance to expiration while wearing these masks. However, during moderate exertion, some swimmers reported dyspnea, tingling in their legs, or an inability to exhale easily. Rarely, unexplained cardiac arrest has occurred. Our results confirmed that even with an airway filter tightly applied to the fitting in a full-face snorkel mask, there was no perceptible increase in inspiratory or expiratory effort at rest. This is unsurprising because these conditions are analogous to a patient breathing through a filter and anesthesia breathing circuit. However, patients are not exercising while breathing through an anesthesia breathing circuit. Despite modifying the snorkel mask, we encountered no signs or symptoms of dyspnea or increased resistance to breathing while performing moderate exercise for 10 minutes. We did not identify substantive changes in cardiorespiratory indices that would point to a limitation in using the modified mask for periods of up to 20 minutes at rest or 10 minutes of moderate exertion (Figure 5).",
