Before being controlled by quarantine measures, ~8000 humans were infected, with fatality as high as 50 % in the elderly and an overall case fatality rate of ~10 % [2]. More recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) has caused a series of serious and, in some cases, fatal human infections [3]. Given the risk of future serious human coronavirusoutbreaks, development of a suitable vaccine platform to protect against such viruses is a major priority. These vaccines present several challenges including the rapidity with which these outbreaks develop and hence the need for rapid vaccine manufacture. Hence, a successful coronavirusvaccine platform must overcome multiple challenges.",

However, immunization of mice with inactivated vaccines either alone or formulated with alum adjuvant resulted in severe lung eosinophilic pathology in response to virus challenge [6\u20139], similar to enhanced lung pathology seen with SARSvirus reexposure after primary infection [10].

This makes vaccine manufacture more complex and expensive and restricts the number of vaccine doses that can be rapidly manufactured. To counter these challenges, it would be preferable to produce a subunit vaccine that just like inactivated virus was able to induce neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, but rather than requiring BSL3 manufacture was able to be produced in a regular recombinant protein manufacturing environment.",

S protein could thereby provide an ideal antigen with which to induce neutralizing antibodies against SARS virus[14, 15]. However, while immunization with S protein in animal models provided some protection against SARS virus [16, 17], S protein-immunized animals when subsequently challenged with live virus developed severe lung eosinophilic immunopathology, with this problem exacerbated even further when S protein vaccine was formulated with alum adjuvant [6, 9]. A similar problem of lung eosinophilic immunopathology has been seen with other viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines, which prime for an excessive and harmful Th2-dominated lung immune response upon subsequent virus exposure [18]. Lung eosinophilic immunopathology is exacerbated by formulation of such vaccines with any adjuvant that induces excess Th2 immune polarization, e.g., aluminum salt adjuvants [6, 9]. Hence, while S protein would appear to be an ideal SARS vaccine antigen, there is first the need to reduce the risk of lung eosinophilic immunopathology being induced by the vaccine.",

Notably, Advax adjuvant was recently shown to enhance the immunogenicity and protection conferred by both inactivated and recombinant SARSvaccines, without the excess Th2 bias of alum adjuvants and hence without the risk of inducing lung eosinophilic immunopathology [33].",

            "text": "For this project a recombinant baculovirus was designed to express the ectodomain of the SARS S protein, lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains [17]. The recombinant protein expressed by this vector was termed SARS S \u0394TM. This truncated version of the S protein was selected as it contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and was able to be expressed in insect cells at a higher level than the full-length membrane-bound version. The SARS S RBD has been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies against the SARS CoV [14, 15]. After infection of expresSF+\u00ae insect cells with the recombinant baculovirus,the S \u0394TM protein is expressed and secreted into the cell culture medium [17]. The procedure detailed below for purifying the SARS S \u0394TM protein can be followed after production of the protein in a baculovirus/insectcell system. The process is designed for a 45 L fermentation in a 60 L bioreactor but may be adjusted to other scales as necessary. Following harvest, the SARS S \u0394TM protein is purified by column chromatography; a schematic is provided in Fig. 1. In the first step, the supernatant is flowed through linked UNOsphere S (UNO S) and DEAE sepharose columns. DNA and protein impurities are removed, and the SARS S \u0394TM protein remains in the flow through. The flow through from the UNO S/DEAE step is applied to lentil lectin sepharose, SARS S \u0394TM binds, and impurities are removed. Following elution from the lentil lectin sepharose column, the protein is concentrated, and buffer is exchanged by ultrafiltration. The retentate from the ultrafiltration step is processed through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter, and the purified protein is stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. Prior to intended use, the purified SARS S \u0394TM protein is mixed under conditions with a suspension of Advax\u2122 delta inulin adjuvant particles and either aseptically filled into single-dose vials or loaded directly into syringes ready for vaccination. Lastly, the adjuvanted SARS vaccine is tested for efficacy and safety in animal immunogenicity and SARS challenge models.\n",

The maximum volume that can be injected into an adult mouse thigh muscle is 50 \u03bcl. If the vaccine cannot be reduced to this volume, then providing the vaccine is not reactogenic and then larger vaccine volumes can be administered by injection of 50 \u03bcl amounts into multiple legs.Starting at 1 week post-immunization, at intervals of 1\u20134 weeks mice are bled using cheek vein bleeding using a lancet in order to obtain ~25\u201350 \u03bcl of blood from which serum is obtained by centrifugation and then stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for later use in antibody assays.\nSARS-specific antibodies are conveniently determined in mouse serum by ELISA. S \u0394TM protein is absorbed to ELISA plates in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After blocking with 1 % BSA/PBS for 1 h, serum samples diluted in 1 % BSA/PBS are incubated for 2 h at room temperature (RT) and then washed. Subsequently, 100 \u03bcl biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, or IgM antibodies (Abcam) plus streptavidin-HRP (BD Biosciences) are added and incubated for 1 h at RT. After washing, wells are incubated with 100 \u03bcl of TMB substrate for 10 min and then stopped by 1 M phosphoric acid. The optical density is measured at 450 nm (OD450 nm) with a VersaMax ELISA microplate reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) and analyzed using SoftMax Pro Software.At the termination of immunogenicity studies, mice are killed by cervical dislocation and bones and spleens are collected to enable measurement of SARS-specific memory T and B cells. Bone marrow is isolated from femurs by flushing with 3 % FBS/PBS. Splenocytes are released by pressing against a cell strainer with a rubber syringe plunger and RBCs are removed by osmotic shock. Cells are washed with 3 % FBS/PBS and then resuspended in RPMI complete medium with 10 % heat-inactivated FBS.For T cell proliferation assays, splenocytes are labeled with 5 \u03bcM CFSE (Invitrogen Life Technologies) for 8 min at RT. CFSE starts to react when exposed to aqueous solutions. It is, therefore, important to avoid dilution of CFSE until immediately before cell labeling.Labeled cells are cultured in 24-well plates at 106 cells/mL/well with or without S \u0394TM protein 1 \u03bcg/mL. After 5-day incubation at 37 \u00b0C and 5 % CO2, cells are washed with 0.1 % BSA/PBS, treated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (BD Biosciences) for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C and then stained with anti-mouse CD4-APC and anti-mouse CD8a-PE-Cy7 (BD) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. Cells are washed with 0.1 % BSA/PBS and then analyzed by FACS (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva software. For each lymphocyte subset, proliferation is expressed as the percentage of divided cells (CFSE low) compared to undivided cells (CFSE high). Dot plots representing analysis of 105 cells are generated by FlowJo software. It is important to have CFSE-labeled, unstimulated cells as a nondividing cell control.The frequency of antigen-specific antibody- or cytokine-secreting cells is analyzed using biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, or IgM antibodies (Abcam) or anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-4 antibody pairs (BD) or LEAF anti-mouse IL-17A and biotin-anti-mouse IL-17A antibody (BioLegend, USA) with streptavidin-HRP (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Briefly, single-cell suspensions are prepared from bone marrowand spleens of mice at indicated time points, plated at 2 \u00d7 105 cells/well in 96-well filtration plates pre-coated with S \u0394TM protein (for antibody detection) or anti-mouse cytokine mAb (for cytokine detection) overnight at 4 \u00b0C, and then blocked with RPMI/10 % FBS. For cytokine assays, the cells are incubated with S \u0394TM protein (10 \u03bcg/mL) at 37 \u00b0C and 5 % CO2 for 2 days. Wells are washed and incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse Ig or anti-mouse cytokine mAb at RT for 2 h, and washed, and then streptavidin-HRP is added for 1 h before washing and addition of AEC substrate solutions (BD Biosciences). Spots are counted by ImmunoSpot S6 ELISPOT analyzer (CTL, USA) and analyzed using ImmunoSpot Software. Spots in negative control wells are subtracted from the number of spots in S protein wells and the results are expressed as antibody-secreting cells (ASC) per 106 BM cells or spots per 106 splenocytes.For statistical analysis, group comparisons for antibody and ELISPOT tests are done by Mann\u2013Whitney test.\n",

This strain was propagated and titrated in Vero 76 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Logan, UT). For in vitro antiviral assays, the serum was reduced to 2 % FBS and gentamicin was added to the medium up to a final concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL. BALB/c micewere infected with the Urbani strain. Three or five days after infection, the lungs were removed and homogenized and then used to reinfect a subsequent group of mice. This infection step was continued 25 times through BALB/c micelungs. The virus was then plaque-purified three times and yielded a virus causing severe lung disease and mortality in infected mice. The virus was verified as SARS-CoV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All experiments involving infectious SARS-CoV viruses need to be conducted in an approved biosafety level 3+ laboratory.At days 3 and 6 post-virus challenge, five mice from each immunized and control group are sacrificed and the lungs harvested for gross pathology (lung score), lung weights, lung virus titers, and measurement of anti- SARS IgG in lung homogenate.For lung scoring, samples from each mouse lung lobe are weighed and placed in a petri dish. Lungs are scored based on surface appearance of lungs. Lungs are then assigned a score ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating that the lungs looked normal and 4 denoting that the entire surface area of the lungs was inflamed and exhibited plum-colored lung discoloration. Significant differences in lung scores are determined by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn\u2019s pairwise comparison post tests. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine significant differences in lung weights. Pairwise comparisons are made by Newman-Keuls posttests.Lung virus titers are analyzed from mice sacrificed on days 3 and 6 post-virus exposure. A lobe from each mouse lung is homogenized in MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and the tissue fragments are allowed to settle. The varying dilutions of the supernatant fluids are assayed in triplicate for infectious virus in Vero 76 cells by cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. The titers (50 % tissue culture infectious dose, CCID50 values) are calculated using the Reed-Muench method. Significant differences are detected by ANOVA. Pairwise comparisons are made by Newman-Keuls posttests.For SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody assay sera are harvested by submandibular bleeding from surviving mice at days 7 and 14 after virus challenge. 7 \u03bcl aliquot of each serum sample is added to approximately 63 \u03bcl of MEM, mixed, and then serially diluted by \u00bd to achieve 1/40 to 1/8192 dilutions in 96-well plates. Virus stock is diluted in MEM to approximately 200 CCID50 per 60 \u03bcl. Next 60 \u03bcl of virus is added to each well, and the plates are vibrated for approximately 1 min, and then incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C for neutralization. 100 \u03bcl of the liquid from each well is then transferred to 96-well plates containing sub-confluent monolayers of Vero 76 cells, and 100 \u03bcl of MEM + 4 % FBS added to each well. Plates are sealed with tape, incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C with 5 % CO2, and scored for the presence or absence of virus CPE. Uninfected wells serve as a negative cell control, and a serum sample with known anti- SARSantibody as a positive control. Results are reported as the inverse of the greatest dilution where virus CPE is not detected.To assess for effects of vaccines on lung eosinophilic immunopathology, immunized and vehicle-treated mice are sacrificed at days 3 and 6 post-virus challenge, and lungs removed. Formalin-fixed lungs are mounted in paraffin blocks. Paraffin-embedded lung sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and a rat monoclonal antibody (Clone MT-14.7) to eosinophil major basic protein MBP (Lee Laboratory, Mayo Clinic, Arizona) following a standard IHC procedure. DAB chromogen identifies eosinophils as brown-stained cells. Eosinophil infiltration is scored without knowing animal identity using H&E-stained slides. An overall infiltration score, 0\u20133, is assigned to each section according to the amounts of eosinophils in the parenchyma and their distributions through the lung. Score 0 = no to a few eosinophils; score 1 = mild eosinophil infiltration; score 2 = moderate infiltration; score 3 = severe infiltration. For confirmation, immunohistochemistry to the eosinophil major basic protein is performed in sections with the highest score of each treatment group.The remainder of the mice are followed for 2 weeks post-challenge to assess survival. Survival analysis is done using the Kaplan-Meier method and a Logrank test. If that analysis reveals statistically significant differences among the treatment groups, pairwise comparison of survivor curves is analyzed by the Mantel-Cox Logrank test, and the relative significance adjusted to a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold for the number of treatment comparisons done. All group comparisons of virus titers are done using analysis of variance to determine experimental significance followed by Newman-Keuls pairwise comparison tests.\n",
