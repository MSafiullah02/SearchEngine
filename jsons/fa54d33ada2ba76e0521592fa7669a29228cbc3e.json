Worldwide, 20% of children and 5% of adults develop symptomatic infections due to influenza A or B viruses each year. 1 The virus causes asymptomatic disease as well as lung, brain, heart, kidney, and muscle disorders and predisposes patients of all age groups to bacterial pneumonia. Illness development depends on the patient's age, pre-existing immunity, immune competence, virus properties, smoking, and pregnancy. Rates of serious infection and death are highest among people aged >65 years and people with serious medical conditions. The virus is most commonly spread among humans by respiratory droplets containing virus via coughing and sneezing but can sometimes also be transmitted directly to humans by avian or swine species.",

Influenza B viruses have only 1 subtype of hemagglutinin and 1 type of neuraminidase and therefore do not undergo antigenic shift, whereas influenza A viruses have 15 different possible subtypes of hemagglutinin (H1-H15) and 9 potential neuraminidase subtypes (N1-N9). Birds can be infected by influenza A viruses with any combination of the 15 HA and 9 NA genes forming a global reservoir of virus. While human and swine pandemic influenza viruses have so far been largely restricted to a few surface antigens (H1, H2, H3, N1, N2; at least as far as can be ascertained, which is going back only a century or so!), there are potentially a large number of possible new surface antigen combinations that could arise and infect humans. It is thought that close association of birds, such as ducks, with mammals, such as pigs, in agriculture allows coinfection with avian and mammalian influenza virus strains, which occasionally leads to the production of a virus with different surface glycopoteins which is still able to infect humans 2 ( Fig. 6.2) .",

An estimated 90% of these deaths occur in persons aged >65 years. 5 The timing and magnitude of influenza virus activity is unpredictable, but using efficient surveillance data, and assessing levels of activity in a timely manner using defined ''threshold values,'' epidemiologists can indicate when sufficient flu activity is occurring in a population to warrant the use of interventions such as the prophylactic use of antiviral drugs. 6 Antiviral chemotherapy is discussed in the section ''Antiviral Treatment.''",

            "text": "The incubation period for influenza is 1-4 days with an average of 2 days, 7 although cough and malaise can persist for more than 2 weeks. Adults typically are infectious from the day before symptoms occur through approximately 5 days after illness. Uncomplicated influenza illness is characterized by the abrupt onset of constitutional and respiratory signs and symptoms such as fever, myalgia, headache, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis. 8 These symptoms are of course common to many viral infections, and respiratory viruses other than influenza are known to contribute to lower respiratory tract complications and deaths in elderly people during the winter months while producing symptoms very similar to those of influenza virus infection. In 1997, Nicholson and colleagues 9 studied the causes of respiratory infections in elderly people living at home in Leicestershire, UK, and concluded that 52% of the diseases were caused by rhinoviruses, 26% by coronaviruses, 9.5% by influenza, and 7% by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Complications in the lower respiratory tract can occur following influenza virus infection in the elderly. The most common serious complication of influenza is pneumonia, which may occur at the same time as the influenza-like illness or up to 2 weeks afterwards. Viral pneumonia accompanied by toxemia can develop within 24 h following the onset of influenza, usually influenza Type A infection. The pneumonia is an interstitial pneumonitis with severe hyperemia and broadening of the alveolar walls together with a mononuclear cell infiltration, capillary dilatation, and thrombosis. 10 The symptoms include tachypneoa, tachycardia, high fever, and hypotension. Hypoxemia and death may follow between 1 and 4 days later. Initial improvement in those who survive occurs 5-16 days after onset of the pneumonia. Generally, there are no lasting complications after severe influenza infection, although a few patients develop a diffuse interstitial fibrosis accompanied by impaired lung function. 10 Pneumonia and secondary infections, which commence after apparent recovery from the influenza infection, are usually caused by a bacterial superinfection with organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus or Hemophilus influenzae. Infection with S. aureus affects the lung by causing oedema, hyperemia, hemorrhaging, consolidation, and formation of pus. When secondary bacterial infections are associated with type A influenza viruses they can be particularly harmful. During influenza A infections, there is apoptosis of leukocytes recruited into the airways, resulting in reduced efficiency of bacterial phagocytosis and destruction. 11 Many other immune functions may be compromised during influenza virus infection, and influenza virus infection of epithelial cells has been shown to directly enhance bacterial adherence to the cells. 12 ",

Flu vaccines need to be redesigned annually to immunize against particular strains or group of strains, a process that can take several months. Chemoprophylaxis should be considered for people at high risk during the time from vaccination until immunity has developed, since antibody responses in adults develop approximately 2-weeks post vaccination. 13 Prophylactic use of antiviral agents is also an option for preventing influenza among persons with anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs or other components of the influenza vaccine, or in ''at-risk'' individuals (including those aged over 65) recently exposed to a person with an influenza like illness, or for those same individuals during an epidemic. Indeed, the U.K. National Institute for Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) recently published guidelines indicating that prophylactic postexposure use of ostelamivir (see below) is recommended for use in at-risk groups in residential care during periods when the virus is known to be circulating, or in unprotected at-risk people exposed to someone with an influenza-like illness. Unprotected people in the cases above means people not vaccinated since the previous flu season, or when the vaccine strain does not closely match the circulating strains of virus, or during the period before the vaccination takes effect.",

They are not effective against influenza B infection, since influenza B viruses lack the M2 protein. When used as prophylactic agent, amantadine can prevent illness while permitting subclinical infection and development of a protective antibody response, which does not interfere with the antibody response to the vaccine. 20 Side effects related to amantadine and rimantadine are usually mild and stop immediately after treatment, but serious side effects have been reported such as central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, behavioral changes, hallucinations, agitation, and seizures. 21, 22 These more severe side effects have been observed among older persons who have been taking amantadine as prophylaxis at a dosage of 200 mg per day 23 and can be reduced by lowering the dosage of the drug.",

It proved to be approximately threefold more potent than zanamavir in inhibiting NA activity of A/H1N1 clinical isolates, approximately fourfold more potent than zanamavir in inhibiting NA activity of A/H3N2 clinical isolates, and approximately sixfold more potent than ostelamivir carboxylate in inhibiting NA activity of influenza B virus clinical isolates. 24 To test the commercial prospects of the drug, phase III trials commenced in North America and Europe in February 2000. RWJ-270201 significantly reduced viral titers in infected patients during phase II studies, without causing any side effects. Under a worldwide influenza collaboration formed in September 1998, Johnson & Johnson has received exclusive worldwide rights to RWJ-270201. 25 Antiviral chemotherapy (choice of drug, dosage, and duration of therapy) depends on patient's age, weight, renal function, health problems, and related medication and should be taken only during the period of peak influenza activity in a community, in order to be more cost effective and reduce the risk of the appearance of resistant viral strains. 26 In a laboratory (ferret) model of infection, resistance of influenza virus A/ LosAngeles/1/87 (H3N2) to amantadine was generated within 6 days, during a single course of treatment, similar to the situation in humans. 27 Influenza surveillance information and diagnostic testing can guide treatment decisions. Early diagnosis of influenza could theoretically reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics and exclude possible bacterial infections, which can produce symptoms similar to influenza as mentioned in the previous section. Diagnostic tests available for influenza include viral culture, serology, rapid antigen testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunofluorescence-based assays. 28 ",

It provides some protection against influenza complications in the elderly including pneumonia and death when given shortly before the beginning of flu season. Each year, the vaccine is reformulated, based on assessment of which viruses have been circulating globally. Not surprisingly, protection appears to vary depending upon how closely the challenge viruses are matched with the vaccine strains. A reduction of 61% in influenza-related deaths was seen when the vaccine and circulatory strains were well matched and only 35% when they were not well matched. 31 Inactivated . Common side effects of the vaccine found in less than one in ten persons are redness, bruising around the injection site, sweating, fever, headache, tiredness, or joint and muscular pain, but these symptoms usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. In general, healthy people in the age group of 65-74 years present minimal systemic side effects and only a low incidence of local side effects after influenza vaccination. 32 Subvirion and purified surface antigen preparations of the inactivated vaccine, as described above, are also available.",

Their adherence, opsonization, and phagocytic ability have shown an age-related decline in several murine models. 50, 51 Expression of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 was delayed in the elderly 52 and the wound healing process was found to be delayed in older humans and rodents 53 because of delayed re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, collagen deposition, wound strength, and delayed infiltration of macrophages. Innate immune responses are frequently initiated via Toll-like-receptors (TLRs), a set of conserved molecules that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous proteins associated with danger and stress signals. Upon TLR stimulation, a variety of antimicrobial peptides and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a, etc.) are synthesized to assist in the clearance of the invading pathogen. The 11 TLRs recognized to date and their ligands, as well as their signaling activation pathways that may be altered during aging, are summarized in Table 6 .2. Clearly, responses to viral infection are influenced by TLRs, such as TLR-3. This receptor is constitutively expressed in human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. Its ligand is double-stranded RNA, which is produced during influenza and other viral infections, and its expression was found to be positively regulated by the influenza A virus via the secretion of the cytokines IL-8, IL-6, RANTES, and interferon-beta, and the upregulation of the major adhesion molecule ICAM-1. 54 In a recent study, Renshaw and colleagues 47 assessed TLR expression on splenic and peritoneal macrophages of aged mice and concluded that decreased expression and function of TLRs resulting from aging may partially contribute to the increased susceptibility of the elderly population to bacterial, viral, and yeast infections.",

First, the egg supply is often limited, and eggs must be ordered a long time in advance. Secondly, many people are allergic to egg proteins and therefore cannot receive the vaccine, and thirdly, not all strains grow well in eggs, and therefore sometimes the virus strain chosen for use in the vaccine is a compromise based upon antigenic similarity to circulating strains and ability to grow in eggs. Because of these problems with egg growth of the virus, there is interest in producing vaccine virus in tissue culture cells.",

            "text": "Influenza matrix protein, which lines the inside of the lipoprotein envelope enclosing the virus RNA ( Fig. 6.1) , is a promising antigenic target. It is a multifunctional protein that plays an important role in virus replication by regulating the bidirectional transport of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) into and out of the nucleus, inhibiting viral RNA polymerase activity by binding to RNP and mediating the association of RNP with viral envelope glycoproteins on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane for virion formation and budding. Influenza-matrix-proteinderived peptide GILGFVFTL was found to be 100-1,000 times more effective than commonly used peptides in sensitizing HLA-A2 + target cells to lysis by influenzavirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 62 The highly conserved M2 integral membrane protein encoded by influenza A viruses has also been suggested as a potential antigen for a universal vaccine. M2 protein possesses an ion channel activity that is required for efficient virus entry into host cells. The M2 cytoplasmic tail, in particular, plays a role in infectious virus production by coordinating the efficient packaging of genome segments into influenza virus particles. 63 Synthetic peptides of M2 extracellular domain conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein complex were found to be highly immunogenic in mice, ferrets, and rhesus monkeys and were able to confer protection against lethal challenge with either H1N1 or H3N2 virus in mice. 64, 65 Disappointingly, antibody induced by the M2 vaccine did not crossreact with the H5N1 virus, which could be related to the next pandemic strain. 65 Another conserved influenza protein, the nucleoprotein (NP), may be a potentially valuable vaccine because of its cross-reactivity against even distantly related virus subtypes. This antigen in combination with small amounts of IL-2 was shown to induce strong proliferation of resting CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from young and elderly donors. 66 Antigen delivery systems can influence the immune response quantitatively as well as qualitatively and the route of administration might drastically affect the success of a vaccine. In the case of influenza, antigen delivery can be critically important, as it might be necessary to stimulate substantial levels of mucosal immunity, which is considered helpful in protection against mucosal infections, in the absence of side effects. New improved intervention strategies through immunization and/or vaccine delivery are therefore needed to reduce morbidity and mortality in the elderly due to influenza and related complications and provide adequate protection during influenza virus epidemics. 10 ",

This may be considered preferable to injection by vaccines, and these vaccines may generate stronger mucosal-cell-mediated immune responses than conventional killed vaccines. FluMist's role in the general prevention of influenza is yet to become clear, and there have been some problems associated with distribution, as the vaccine had to remain frozen. In order to circumvent this problem, a next-generation live vaccine was recently produced by MedImmune named CAIV-T, assessed in clinical trials and shown to be immunogenic and safe in healthy and at-risk populations. 67 ",

            "text": "Other methods of mucosal vaccine delivery have been investigated including the use of heterologous viral systems. In a recent report, Abe and colleagues 68 demonstrated protection against lethal influenza virus infection in mice immunized intranasally with a recombinant baculovirus expressing the hemagglutinin gene of the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) flu virus. Protection was later linked to activation of immune cells by bAcNPV via the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)/MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. 69 Similar to these findings, vaccination with influenza virosomes has shown to elicit high titer of influenza-specific antibodies and T-helper cell and cytotoxic T-cell responses against encapsulated antigens due to the intrinsic adjuvant activity of virosomal formulations. 70 Improved cell-mediated immune responses have long been considered a desirable attribute of influenza vaccines. Novel pH-triggered microparticles encapsulating a model MHC class I-restricted peptide Ag from the influenza A matrix protein were efficiently phagocytosed by human monocytes and dendritic cells, and led to increased antigen presentation and primed CTL responses with minimal cellular toxicity and no functional impairment. 71 As described above, TLR stimulation may be important in immune responses to vaccines and is certainly important in the action of adjuvants designed to enhance vaccine responses. TLR expression and function may also decline in older people. 47 Binding of the cell surface protein CD154 on activated T cells to CD40 on B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and other cell types leads to B-cell activation, proliferation, and antibody production independently of Toll receptor recognition and signaling. We have described work showing that conjugates of anti-CD40 mAbs with antigens are very potent immunogens 72,73 and we have recently observed that CD40 adjuvant conjugates with influenza virus antigens were successful in inducing specific anti-influenza antibody and cellular responses. 74 Similar approaches have been employed with anti-CD40 mAb and liposomally encapsulated nuclear protein peptide NP366-374, corresponding to a CTL epitope on NP. Intranasal immunization of this formulation effectively induced mucosal immunity to reduce virus replication in the lung, suggesting that anti-CD40 mAb also functioned as a mucosal adjuvant through MHC class I-and class II-dependent pathways. 75 Another interesting approach compared the immunogenicity and safety of a novel, interleukin-2 (IL-2)-supplemented trivalent liposomal influenza vaccine (INFLU-SOME-VAC) with that of a commercial trivalent split virion vaccine in communityresiding elderly volunteers of a mean age 81 years. At 1-month post vaccination, hemagglutination inhibition for the A/New Caledonia (H1N1) and A/Moscow (H3N2) strains was significantly higher in the INFLUSOME-VAC group. INFLUSOME-VAC also induced a greater anti-neuraminidase (NA-N2) response without the detection of IL-2 antibodies and no increase in anti-phospholipid IgG antibodies, while the adverse reactions were similar in both the liposomal and split virion vaccine. 30 Similar delivery systems developed for mucosal immunization include immunestimulating complexes (ISCOM), cage-like structures about 30-40 nm in diameter composed of glycosides, cholesterol, immunizing protein antigen, and phospholipids. ISCOM influenza vaccines have been shown to be more immunogenic than conventional vaccines in humans 76 but failed to protect monkeys against distant drift variants of influenza A (H3N2) viruses. 77 ",
