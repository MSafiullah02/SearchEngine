Acute kidney failure is an important complication in critically ill patients and is associated with increased mortality, length of stay, and cost.10, 14, 15, 32 However, little is known about AKI5, 6, 7 in critically ill patients with pandemic H1N1. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to describe the impact of pandemic H1N1 on the time course of kidney injury, kidney failure, and anticipated need for dialysis therapy in critically ill patients.",

Although our study included a large cohort (N = 50) of critically ill patients with pandemic H1N1, the sample size was too small to permit multivariate modeling or precise effect estimates. Multivariate analysis might have more accurately identified risk factors for kidney injury and failure in pandemic H1N1 and more accurately estimated the independent impact (ie, adjusted for confounding) of kidney failure on outcome in these patients. Although acute kidney failure was associated with mortality, the CI of the effect was wide (1.29-98.8), limiting its precision. Little information was available before ICU admission, and data for initial clinical presentation and type and timing of interventions might have shed further light on why kidney injury develops in some patients, but not others. Criteria for the initiation of dialysis therapy were not standardized; therefore, the incidence of dialysis may reflect local practice patterns to some degree, limiting generalizability. The study population is from a single region (Manitoba, Canada) and had a large proportion of First Nations (aboriginal) patients, factors that may limit generalizability to other centers and regions.",

Because of the strong association between kidney outcomes and both mortality and length of ICU stay, careful monitoring and characterization of kidney injury should be performed early in admission. These findings are of importance for clinicians in prognosticating their patients with suspected pandemic H1N1 infection, in addition to administrators planning for equipment and personnel training with this novel emerging infectious disease pandemic.",
