This network (Fig. 1) is very articulated in its interconnections, which include regulator chains, single input motifs, and multiple feedback loops generated by the combination of transcriptional activators and repressors. We selected well-characterized promoter/TF-encoding-genes pairs. We chose nonessential and nonredundant TF-genes that can be knocked out without affecting yeast viability. The following genes have been chosen for IRMA: as activators and repressors encoding genes: SWI5, ASH1, CBF1, GAL4, and GAL80; as promoter genes: HO, ASH1, MET16, GAL10 (Fig. 1).\n",

We took advantage of the inducible Tet regulatory system: the expression of Tetracycline-controlled transactivator tTA is self-controlled by a CMV-TET promoter responsive to thetTA itself unless Tetracycline, or its analogous Doxycycline, is added to the medium in which cells are grown (4). To follow the protein dynamics of the positive feedback loop, a destabilized yellow variant of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (d2EYFP) (Clontech), with a half-life of approximately 2 h, was expressed together with the tTA transactivator from the same mRNA, via an Intra Ribosomal Entry Sequence (IRES) in between of the transactivator tTA and the d2EYFP (Fig. 2). In order to stably express in HEK293 cells the inducible feedback loop and to better characterize its dynamics overtime, we used a lentiviral vector (5, 6), based on the multisite Gateway technology provided by Invitrogen.\n",

            "text": "When deriving a model from experimental data, three major approaches can be used: white-box, black-box, and gray-box. In white-box modeling, the model and parameter values are entirely derived from first principles, while in black-box, the model is completely derived from input\u2013output data. The third alternative, the so-called gray-box approach (7), combines the two above approaches. Specifically, first principles are used to partially derive the model structure, while parameters in the model are estimated from experimental data. The approach described in this chapter, both for the yeast and the mammalian synthetic network, is a gray-box one. In this case, modeling entails the following main steps to be executed iteratively: (1) derivation of the model equations and (2) estimation of the model parameters from experimental data and/or literature. Step (1) requires introducing simplifying hypothesis and choosing a proper formal framework. Among the different mathematical formalisms, those based on differential equations are commonly used to describe the average behavior of a population of cells (8). The Differential Equations modeling approach is based on the following biological assumptions: the quantified concentrations are homogeneous in space and they are continuous quantities in time. These assumptions hold true for processes evolving on long time scales in which the number of molecules of the species in the reaction volume is sufficiently large. Step (2) is required to estimate unknown model parameters from the available experimental data. Experimental data are strongly affected by noise. Hence, classical optimization methods, based on gradient descent from an arbitrary initial guess of the parameters\u2019 value, can be unfeasible. The above considerations suggest looking at stochastic optimization algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) (9), which provide a flexible approach to nonlinear optimization. Their application has been proved to yield good results in the parametrization of synthetic networks (10, 11).",

            "text": "Once a model of a synthetic network has been derived, it is possible to refine it by means of several alternative strategies. The primary goal of model refinement is the improvement of model predictions as regards the network dynamics, i.e., how gene and protein expression change in time following a perturbation; in order to accomplish this task, the experimenter may need to stimulate its synthetic network with highly dynamical signals. This is usually done to elicit nonlinear modes or other peculiar characteristics of the network under development. Most of the synthetic networks documented so far (12) use chemical compounds as inducers and thus the previous requirement often translates in the need to quickly change the concentration of these compounds in the media where cells are grown. On the contrary, effective strategies for data acquisition are needed to measure changes in the concentration of the species of interest in live cells. Here, we propose an integrated strategy intended to solve both of these issues at once via \u201cmicrofluidics\u201d devices and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Microfluidics involves the manipulation of very small fluid volumes, enabling creation and control of nanoliter-volume reactors, thus mimicking cellular microenvironments. Microfluidics devices can be conveniently used to finely control the concentration of compounds in the extracellular environment during time lapse microscopy experiments. Data acquired from long term stimulation of cells carrying fluorescent tags and tracked by the microscopy imaging can be conveniently used to improve the quality of the mathematical model of the circuit of interest.",

To this end, we used the ViraPower Promoterless Lentiviral Gateway Expression System (Invitrogen), which takes advantage of the site-specific recombination properties of bacteriophage lambda, making the transfer of single DNA sequences faster than the usual cloning strategies.\nCloning of a destabilized yellow-green variant of enhanced green fluorescent protein (d2EYFP) in the pMAtTA-IRES-EGFP vector: the d2EYFP was amplified from pd2EYFP-1 (Clontech) by PCR using the High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase Taq Phusion, with a forward primer containing a NheI recognition sequence and a reverse primer containing an EcoRV recognition sequence. The PCR product and pMAtTA-IRES-EGFP were then digested with NheI-EcoRV restriction enzymes and the d2EYFP ligated in place of EGFP (ratio ng of vector/ng of d2EYFP  =  1/3\u20131/5).Generating the pENTR vectors: in order to produce a lentiviral vector by using the gateway system we first generated the pENTR vectors containing the genes and the promoters of interest flanked by specific recombination sites. The pMAtTA-IRES-d2EYFP was linearized with the AseI restriction enzyme and recombined with the pDONR221 (invitrogen) following the manufacturer instruction. In this way we generated pENTRtTA-IRES-d2EYFP vector with specific recombination sites. The CMV-TET promoter was amplified from pTRE2 (clontech) by PCR. The PCR was performed with the Taq polymerase provided by Invitrogen that adds a single deoxyadenosine (A) to the 3\u2032 ends of PCR products. This allows PCR inserts to ligate efficiently with the pENTR5\u2032-TOPO vector which is supplied linearized with single 3\u2032-deoxythymidine (T) overhangs, obtaining the pENTR5\u2032-TOPO-CMV-TET with specific recombination sites. Finally, we performed a recombination reaction between the pENTRtTA-IRES-d2EYFP, pENTR5\u2032-TOPO-CMV-TET, and the pLenti/R4R2/V5-DEST using the LR clonase enzyme according to manufacturer instructions. The lentivirus was then produced in 293FTcells as described in the instructions provided by Invitrogen.Cell culture for lentiviral transduction: To transduce cells with the virus produced, 500000 HEK293 cells were plated and incubated overnight. The day of transduction the medium was removed and 1 mL of the virus was added to the cells together with polybrene to a final concentration of 6 \u03bcg/mL. After an overnight incubation the medium containing the virus was removed and replaced with complete culture medium containing the blasticidin to a final concentration of 3 mg/mL to select for stably transduced cells.To test the dynamics of the autoregolatory loop, we performed two sets of time-series experiments in which stably integrated HEK293 cells were imaged using time-lapse microscopy and fluorescence of d2EYFP was quantified. For both the experimental designs in the first time point, cells were treated with Doxycycline to \u201cswitch off\u201d the network, since Doxycycline prevents the tTA transactivator to bind the CMV-TET responsive promoter. In the first set of experiments, the dynamics were followed for 37 h at 37\u00b0C, while in the second set the temperature was reduced to 32 \u00b0C to limit cell motility and thus facilitate image analysis (13).\n",

Thus, we decided to use a phenomenological approach, assuming that (A8) the protein-protein interaction between Gal80 and Gal4 can be modeled as a direct inhibition of GAL80 on the promoter of SWI5, and that the strength of such inhibition depends on the medium (strong inhibition in glucose, weak inhibition in galactose).

We attribute them to the unmodeled effect of protein dynamics, which have been removed from the original model due to the lack of experimental measurements. In particular, we noticed that the Gal4 protein is stable (18), and therefore even a small, or transient, increase in its mRNA level is able to induce the GAL10 promoter, regulating Swi5 in our network. Since we do not explicitly model protein dynamics, a small increase in GAL4 mRNA cannot fully activate GAL10 in the model and does not cause the increase in SWI5 mRNA seen in vivo. The quality of the fitting and the predictions could be further improved by modeling the proteins levels of all the genes in the network. However, in the actual version of the network, it is not possible to measure protein levels with the exception of only one gene (Cbf1). Thus, the assumption of steady state for protein dynamics is required, not only to simplify the model but also mainly to not introduce the problem of overfitting and nonuniqueness of parameters for proteins.",

Indeed, in Fig. 6e we analyzed how the presence of the positive feedback loop affects the switch-off dynamics: decreasing its strength (green line) or removing it (black line), the network is switched off much faster.

We, thus, recommend to add 5 U of the Alkaline Phosphatase, Calf Intestinal (CIP) (New England Biolabs) to the vector linearized and to leave the reaction at 55\u00b0C for 45 min, and then to purify the fragment with the QIA quick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN).It is really necessary to control that all the concentrations of the vectors you find in the ViraPower Promotrless Lentiviral Gateway Expression System are correct.The Doxycycline and Blasticidine working solution can be stored at 4\u00b0C up to 1 month.As reported, when you are modeling a synthetic network, to decide what can be simplified, and what needs to be modeled in more details, it is necessary to go through iterative refinement steps both in the model and in the experimental dataset.When the number of unknown parameters is high, as in yeast network case, and the physical feasible range for them is large, it is not easy to identify them. Even though stochastic identification techniques provide a flexible approach to nonlinear optimization, it is good to proceed with hand refinement. Thus, we proceeded in this way:\nMultiple identification of each parameter running GA more than one time letting the parameter vary in a physical feasible range. In this way, we obtained different values for each parameter (even with the same setting, since the algorithm is stochastic) that, however, remain quite close to each other. Thus, this step allows to significantly restricting the search range.Hand refinement of the parameters in the narrow range obtained in step (a).\nSince each experiment is costly and time consuming, the best option in the iterative analysis of a biological network is, at each step, to only perform those experiments that the mathematical modeling deems indispensable. In the case of the yeast network, we could have performed the promoter strength experiments from the beginning, since the Hill functions were almost unchanged during the model refinement, with the exception of the GAL10 and HO promoters modeling. However, the need of performing such experiments arose after the identification of Model C, since we did not trust the identified Hill functions parameters.The quality of the microscopy section is of primary importance in experiments involving S. cerevisiae expressing fluorescent reporters due to the thickness of the wall protecting yeasts from the external environment. Yeast experiments of this type are best carried out at magnifications like 40\u00d7 and 60\u00d7. High numerical aperture objectives should be preferred to make the image processing easier. High-quality mercury lamps are needed to obtain good fluorescent field images; CCD cameras can lower the Signal to Noise Rate (SNR) associated to the images when compared to conventional cameras (20).Attention should be paid to the air-bubbles washing steps: PDMS is porous and the user can take advantage of this property to get rid of the air-bubbles just by injecting ddH2O at high pressure (just by pressing the plunger of the syringes used to flush the device). Once there are no more bubbles in the device, the experimenter should pay attention to the disconnection of the ddH2O syringes: the needles should be gently disconnected and pressing the plunger for 10 s before unplugging the related needle can help in generating the pressure needed to prevent air from reentering the port.All media, sugars and dyes to be used should be filtered with 0.22 \u03bcm filters so as to avoid the presence of small particles that can accelerate the clogging of the device or, alternatively, mislead the image segmentation algorithm. The preparation of the media in a fume hood does provide a strong advantage in this context.When sugars such as galactose are used as inducers, supplementing with supporting metabolic sources should be considered as an option. Growth of yeast cells in media featuring galactose can be quite slow: having cells slowly moving in a field can be a good advantage from the point of view of the image processing algorithm, unfortunately the metabolic implications of these conditions cannot always be predicted with accuracy thus adding uncertainty to our experiments.In the proposed protocol, we used a red fluorescent dye, namely, Sulforhodamine B, whose excitation and emission spectra largely overlap with red fluorescent protein tag (e.g., Cherry etc.). If the protein to be controlled is tagged with such a fluorescent protein it may help using a different dye (e.g., Atto 655) to track the inducer compound concentration. Nevertheless, it should be noted that choosing such option may imply buying new filters (Atto 655, for example, emits in the far red and requires a specific filter like the Cy5.5-A (Semrock, PN FF685-Di01-25  \u00d7  36)).The image processing algorithm is one of the key points of the whole setup: several free software packages have been proposed in the field of cellular microscopy being CellProfiler (21), Cell-ID (22), CellTracker (23). Nevertheless, it should be noted that achieving a good quality of segmentation often may require a long session of parameter fine-tuning and, more often, flexibility of these packages is an added value and not a core characteristic. Experienced users should consider developing their own code on the basis of their specific application and experimental context: testing the dependence of the \u00adsegmentation results on the experimental conditions may help in \u00adoptimizing the code and make it more robust to varying boundary conditions.\n",
