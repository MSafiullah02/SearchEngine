With the recent epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), type A Fujian influenza, tuberculosis, HIV, monkey pox and other communicable diseases, strict regulations on infection control have been developed to reduce the risk of disease transmission. Public health measures have to adapt to new health threats and methods of disease control. A comprehensive infectious disease law is needed to enforce the control measures for an effective implementation.",

Epidemiological methods are used to assess incubation periods, causative agents, mode of spread, community trends as well as preventive measures. The age\u2010old accepted principles of prevention and spread of communicable diseases are implemented. With data available to us, we commence empirical treatment irrespective of the manifestations of the disease. At the same time, supportive treatment goes hand\u2010in\u2010hand with the empirical treatment. As and when the exact agent is identified, we then commence the specific treatment. If a drug is available against the putative agent, we then change the empirical treatment into the definitive treatment.
