The data include all outpatient and inpatient demographics, visit information, diagnoses, procedures, medications, vital signs, care provider notes, orders and prescriptions, laboratory results, radiology reports, and numerous other ancillary reports. Laboratory and ancillary data are fed directly to the warehouse from the source computing systems and serve as the gold standard for data quality reviews for clinical trials. The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics initiative data quality tool set called Achilles Heel 2 includes an extensive knowledge base of data consistency checks used to verify the quality of the Columbia warehouse. Data are requested from the warehouse via a formal specification that is approved by an institutional committee and executed by an analyst.",

Evaluated laboratory tests included creatinine, D-Dimer, ferritin, Creactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin. We have included additional laboratory tests in this supplement that were not included in the propensity score. Initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio was calculated by estimating the PaO2 from the first recorded oxygen saturation available and then dividing by the estimated FiO2 for that oxygen delivery method (0.21 for room air, 0.21 + (oxygen flow rate * 0.03) for nasal cannula, 0.80 for non-rebreather mask 3, 4 or the recorded FiO2 for non-invasive or invasive ventilation). Diagnostic categories were created by grouping ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes using the Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and joining related categories such as Cancer that has many CCS codes. These diagnosis categories included chronic lung disease (including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and chronic bronchitis), cancer, chronic kidney disease, essential hypertension, hypertension with complications, diabetes without complications, diabetes with complications, pulmonary heart disease and HIV, organ transplant or other immune suppression. Medications evaluated included angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers, statins, steroids, oral anti-coagulation, antibiotics (with the exclusion of azithromycin as it is categorized separately), other potential treatments for COVID-19 (tocilizumab and remdesivir), azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. We classified patients for each medication depending on whether they received the medication at any point during their hospital stay. Because of the dramatic increase in the need for ICU beds, multiple units that are not typically ICUs were converted to ICUs at various times as patient volumes increased, so identification of ICU patients was not possible. Use of intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation was detected using a combination of ventilator orders, ventilator flowsheets and intubation notes. In clinical practice, the use of invasive mechanical ventilation was left to physician discretion.",
