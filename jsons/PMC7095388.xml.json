The 2016 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines consist of 93 statements on the early management and resuscitation of sepsis and septic shock, of which 32 are strong recommendations (7 based upon high evidence, 21 based upon moderate evidence and 4 based upon low evidence), 39 are weak recommendations (7 based upon moderate evidence, 32 based upon low or very low evidence) and 18 are best practice statements. Following recommendations contained within the Surviving Sepsis guidelines has been associated with improved outcomes [4, 5]. However, gaps in the data frequently exist, leading to insufficient clarity on many elements of sepsis management and precluding recommendations on many topics. Notably, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines are designed to assist bedside practitioners in the treatment of patients with sepsis and septic shock and therefore are restricted solely to management issues.",

Choices were weighted so that each respondent\u2019s first choice was worth three points, second choice was worth two points and third choice was worth one point. The initial goal was to generate a top five priority list; however, a three-way tie for the fourth place resulted in the final top six priority list (Fig. 1). Of note, nine different questions received a first choice vote. A total of 13/16 first choice votes are represented in the top six priorities, and no question outside of the top six priorities received more than two votes total (and no question outside of the top six received more than a single first choice vote).",

These priorities are not presented in order of importance, as we did not attempt to discriminate the relative importance of the top six research priorities. Although there was no intent to highlight any specific subgroups in the top priorities, they were nearly evenly distributed from the subgroups including infection (two priorities), fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, scoring/identification, and post-intensive care unit. The only subgroup that was not represented was administration/epidemiology.

Combination therapy is defined herein as the use of two different classes (usually of different mechanistic classes) of antimicrobial agents for a single pathogen. There are two possible reasons for using combination therapy\u2014(a) to accelerate pathogen clearance rather than to broaden antimicrobial coverage or (b) to assure that one pathogen is sensitive to the antibiotic, in light of significant microbial resistance. The most common therapy combinations include a beta-lactam with an aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone or macrolide. It is important to note that sensitivity of microbes to these antibiotics varies locally, and this should be taken into account prior to prescribing combination therapy. Combination therapy must be distinguished from broad spectrum antibiotics (i.e. a single gram positive agent, a single gram negative agent, a single anti-fungal agent).",

            "text": "It should be noted, however, that there are significant conflicting data regarding combination therapy in bacteremia, sepsis without shock and septic shock. A randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial of 600 patients with sepsis or septic shock treated with monotherapy or combination therapy did not demonstrate a change in organ failure or mortality between the two groups [10]. A recent meta-analysis of empirical monotherapy vs combination therapy for adult ICU patients with sepsis showed no difference in mortality or other patient-important outcomes, although the quantity and quality of data was low [11]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of monotherapy versus beta lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy for sepsis found no difference in mortality but an increase in nephrotoxicity in the combination therapy group [12]. This is consistent with a subsequent study from the Netherlands (which has a low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance) of a short course (median length 2 days) of adjunctive empirical therapy in patients with sepsis and septic shock which found an increased incidence of renal failure but not with improved survival in patients receiving combination therapy [13]. This has led some experts to support using two agents in empiric treatment for septic shock but to de-escalate to monotherapy once susceptibilities become available [14] or to call for more evidence in light of the theoretical benefits of targeted combination therapy but the mix of supporting and non-supporting data and overall insufficient data [15].",

Healthy people are frequently asymptomatically infected by viruses that can subsequently persist in a latent state. For instance, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects approximately 50\u201380% of otherwise healthy adults, who have lifelong latency in multiple cell types following their initial asymptomatic infection [29]. Several studies have reported reactivation of viruses in critically ill patients that do not have a prior history of being immunocompromised, and this is associated with worse outcomes in critical illness [30, 31]. Notably, in a study of 560 critically ill septic patients, 161 critically-ill non-septic patients and 164 age-matched healthy controls, cumulative viral DNA detection rates in the blood included CMV (24%), Epstein\u2013Barr (53%), herpes simplex (14%), human herpes virus-6 (10%) and TTV (78%) despite these being uncommon in both critically-ill non-septic patients and healthy controls [32]. Notably, 42.7% of septic patients had two or more viruses. These are consistent with studies specifically looking at CMV in the ICU which demonstrate active rates of 17% in non-immunosuppressed patients, mostly occurring between 4 and 12 days after ICU admission [33, 34].",

Faster diagnosis of sepsis could potentially reduce mortality, shorten length of stay, and lower hospital costs [37, 38]. However, diagnosis of sepsis relies upon a clinician suspecting infection without the actual ability to diagnose infection in real time. A significant number of patients with sepsis never have positive cultures. In addition, even in patients whose cultures will ultimately be positive, there is a time lag of hours to days between when the sample is sent to when the positive result is obtained. Further, outside of the potential utility of biomarkers such as procalcitonin, there is little available to the clinician to determine if the infection has resolved. The inability to rapidly diagnose infection and/or to determine when the infection has cleared can lead to widespread usage of broad spectrum antibiotics [39]. Notably, despite advances in the technology available to treat septic patients, culturing techniques used for identifying infection have not changed substantially over a number of decades. Numerous rapid diagnostic tests have been tested in patients for the identification of infection. Further, numerous biomarkers have been tested for the identification or prognostication of sepsis (covered elsewhere in this manuscript).",

However, this process can take days, during which time patients may be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics until positive pathogen identification becomes available (which may never happen considering that many septic patients are culture negative). In addition, it is sometimes difficult to obtain samples. For instance, sputum is not always available in septic patients with pneumonia who are not intubated, and peritoneal fluid is not always accessible in septic patients with peritonitis. Faster and more accurate pathogen identification is therefore critical [40, 41]. When a culture is flagged as positive a gram stain is performed that can potentially provide information about the type of organism responsible for the infection; however, this does not provide an acceptable level of accuracy to guide therapy. Instead, tailored therapeutic intervention relies on identification of species, which can take days using conventional techniques, and the antibiotic resistance profile will typically be available only 1\u20132 days after that. Further, detection of fungi, viruses, and anaerobic bacteria can be more challenging than detecting aerobic bacteria, both in terms of timing and sensitivity. Several methods to detect the implicated pathogen (bacterial DNA detection, syndromic PCR) and detection of resistant organisms and/or rapid antibiogram have recently developed [42\u201345]. Unfortunately, none of these techniques has been widely adopted due to a combination of factors including (but not limited to) cost, logistics and accuracy concerns.",

If so, studies need to determine which techniques and/or methods are superior or if further optimization is required, which may require both technological advances and examination of test accuracy across a variety of resource settings. Importantly, the role of rapid diagnostic tests in antibiotic stewardship (when to start, how broad, when to de-escalate, when to stop) needs to be examined. Further, although it is logical to believe that rapid diagnostic tests could potentially change patient outcomes, this assumption should be formally tested. Finally, assessing the immune system and performing rapid diagnostic tests might potentially help identify both the infecting organism and the dysregulated host response simultaneously, and an integrative approach examining both microbe and host may yield critical insights that assaying each in isolation might miss.",

However, the potential benefits of administering fluid must be balanced against the potential for harm due to the accumulation of fluid, such as, pulmonary edema, abdominal compartment syndrome, and tissue edema. Current recommendations from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggest resuscitating patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion with at least 30 ml/kg of IV crystalloid within the first 3 h [3]. The Surviving Sepsis bundles have been associated with improved survival in numerous large-scale studies [4, 6, 47], although the specific importance of each individual component of the bundle is unclear. It should be noted that while more rapid completion of the 3 h bundle and rapid administration of antibiotics was associated with improved outcome in a study of nearly 50,000 patients, a longer time to completion of initial fluid bolus was not associated with a change in mortality [6]. Further, the amount of fluid administered was not associated with survival differences in observational and randomized studies of early goal directed therapy [48]. Also, an early resuscitation protocol including intravenous fluids, vasopressors, blood transfusion and invasive monitoring was associated with increased mortality compared to usual care in patients with sepsis (mostly HIV) and hypotension in a developing country [49].",

However, there are instances where a patient will not improve despite the administration of fluids. Identifying robust clinical parameters that distinguish patients likely to positively respond to a fluid bolus from those unlikely to respond is an essential need in sepsis care.

Dynamic measures include a variety of techniques to assess the change in cardiac output in response to transient changes in preload induced by ventilation or an external maneuver, prior to fluid administration. Common types of dynamic measures used in clinical practice include passive leg raise (PLR) maneuver, respiratory variation, pulse pressure variation (PPV), and stroke volume variation (SVV) [54]. However, variations in respiratory patterns or pulse pressure and stroke volume can be difficult to interpret in spontaneously breathing patients.

The Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) study found no difference in 28-day mortality for patients randomized to 0.9% normal saline or 4% albumin, although there was a trend towards improved outcomes in the study for patients with sepsis in a post hoc subgroup analysis [57]. Mortality was also not different between patients receiving 20% albumin or crystalloid in a large randomized trial in patients with sepsis or septic shock (ALBIOS trial) [58]. However, while the overall study did not show a difference in outcome, subgroup analysis showed improved mortality in patients with septic shock. Multiple meta-analyses have been performed comparing albumin to crystalloid, although different populations have made combining the data challenging [59]. Together, these have led to a weak recommendation (based upon low quality evidence) in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign for using albumin in addition to crystalloids for both initial resuscitation and subsequent intravascular volume replacement in patients with both sepsis and septic shock who require substantial amounts of crystalloid [3]. Within the context of the broader categories of crystalloids and colloids, there exist distinctions between individual fluid choices [60, 61]. Hydroxyethyl starch should not be used on the basis of the increased risk for acute kidney injury and need for renal replacement therapy, in addition to increased mortality in many meta-analyses [62\u201365].",

Crystalloid solutions, such as, Ringer\u2019s lactate and PlasmaLyte, have been studied with varying results [67]. Lactate-based chloride-free solutions have been developed and can improve cardiac output and blood pressure while achieving a negative fluid balance [68]. While numerous smaller studies have demonstrated benefit in balanced crystalloids, a randomized controlled comparing 0.9% normal saline to PlasmaLyte did not reduce the risk of acute kidney injury [69]. However, while this study is widely quoted, the majority of the patients were admitted following elective surgery, had relatively few co-morbidities, received a relatively small amount of fluid, were not septic, and the overall mortality was low. As such, the relevance of this study to septic patients is unclear. Recently, two large randomized controlled trials compared balanced crystalloids to 0.9% normal saline in 15,802 critically ill patients from 5 ICUs and 13,347 non-critically ill emergency department patients who were subsequently hospitalized outside of the ICU [70, 71]. In critically ill patients, balanced crystalloids resulted in a statistically significant 1.1% decrease in the composite outcome of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy or persistent renal dysfunction. While balanced crystalloids did not change the primary outcome of hospital free days in non-critically ill patients, they were associated with a statistically significant 0.9% decrease in the composite outcomes of major adverse kidney events seen in critically ill patients. Although a subgroup analysis showed a larger decrease (5.1%) in composite outcome in septic patients given balanced crystalloids, it is important to note that patients with sepsis or septic shock represented less than 15% of the ICU patients in this study [70]. Further, the percent of septic patients was not reported in the study on non-critically ill patients [71]. As such the applicability of these results to septic patients (who often require a greater amount of fluids, and suffer from a higher incidence of kidney dysfunction and have a higher risk of death) remains to be determined.",

Epinephrine is also a suitable substitute as a vasopressor when inotropy is also required (similar to a combination of a norepinephrine and dobutamine). As a non-catecholamine vasopressor, vasopressin has been demonstrated to be safe as an adjunct agent to norepinephrine and to potentially improve outcome in a subgroup of patients with less severe septic shock [73]. Of note, vasopressin as a primary agent has been compared to norepinephrine, yielding no difference with regards to acute kidney injury and failing to confirm the beneficial effects in patients with less severe shock [74]. More recently, angiotensin II has demonstrated efficacy in raising mean arterial pressure (MAP) but outcome data are still lacking [75]. In contrast, non-selective inhibition of nitric oxide synthase has been shown to increase mortality [76], highlighting that evaluation of vasopressors should not be based solely on its hemodynamic effects. Finally, a higher MAP target has not been shown to be beneficial in patients in septic shock, although in a subgroup of patients with severe baseline hypertension, targeting a higher MAP is associated with less need for renal replacement therapy [77].",

Using the broader categories of fluid choices (crystalloids and colloids) as an analogy, a therapeutic approach comparing a catecholamine (e.g. norepinephrine) to a non-catecholamine (e.g. vasopressin, angiotensin II) to raise MAP and improve survival is necessary. Similarly, the role of epinephrine as a second line agent needs to be evaluated. Further, while angiotensin II has recently been shown to effectively increase blood pressure in patients with vasodilatory shock that do not respond to high doses of conventional pressors, the indications for this new agent remain to be determined as do its effect on outcomes. Defining an acceptable dose range of vasopressors for which to escalate therapy vs. initiate a second agent is also necessary. To accomplish this effectively requires rigorous investigation into how vasopressors are dosed and titrated. Finally, subgroups of patients should be evaluated (heart failure, essential hypertension), given the predilection of some patients to suffer adverse events of hypotension as well as those resulting from vasopressor therapy (arrhythmias or acute kidney injury).",

Similarly, clinical practice guidelines are based upon a composite of overall best practice for the greatest number of patients. This does not account for individual differences as an intervention in a trial that showed overall benefit could potentially be of no benefit or harm to an individual participating, whereas an intervention in a trial that showed no benefit could potentially be beneficial to a subgroup of participating patients. The pathophysiology of sepsis is a complex and dynamic process that originates from the host response to infection and varies according to (at a minimum) the genetic predisposition, immune status, age and co-morbid conditions of the host, the type of pathogen and the site and extent of infection. Recent advance in omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenomics, microbiomics) have the potential to revolutionize care by assaying the state of an individual [78, 79]. Individual insights need not be confined to \u201comics\u201d-based data, however, as important insights can be drawn from easily interpretable clinical information and by use of big data approaches that allow insight from information accessible within the ICU that might not be able to be processed by a bedside provider [80].",

An example of an early attempt was the MONARCS trial, where sepsis patients with IL-6 levels > 1000 pg/mL were targeted for treatment with an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody [84]. Similarly, attempts at targeting corticosteroid therapy have not been successfully reproduced, yet corticosteroids are used frequently in patients with septic shock [85, 86]. Precision medicine may also rely on clinical signs. As an example, an ideal trial on inotropic agent for treating the consequences of sepsis-associated myocardial depression should include patients with signs of tissue hypoperfusion associated with a low or inadequate cardiac output related to an impairment in contractility. This is a different approach from a recent trial design that included patients in shock with minimal (if any) assessment of cardiac output and cardiac function [87].",

However, these results were driven mainly by hemoperfusion and plasma exchange, and pooling of all trials of blood purification for treatment of sepsis was no longer associated with lower mortality after excluding trials using polymyxin B hemoperfusion [88].

Moreover, many of the studies have high risk of bias and are underpowered. Further, several basic aspects of enteral nutrition support remain uncertain. It is unclear if the proper goal of providing enteral nutrition is to reach a certain caloric goal or if there a superior target. There is also significant controversy about whether feeding tolerance should be measured using gastric residual volume or other indicators and whether this is impacted by type of patient (surgical vs. non-surgical). There is also a lack of clarity regarding whether nutrition formulas need to be altered in sepsis, such as with micronutrient supplementation or immunonutrition formulas. For patients with septic shock, it remains to be determined at what dose of vasopressors enteral nutrition can be provided (and if type of vasopressor impacts this), if there is a maximum tolerated dose during shock, and if there is a benefit to trophic enteral feeding (with or without parenteral nutrition) while on pressors.

Two meta-analyses suggest that use of LPV in patients without ARDS reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation, the risk of pulmonary infection and the duration of hospitalization [102, 103].

Relatively little is known, however, about the pathobiology of dysfunction in individual organ systems that is associated with these outcomes. Clinical identification is based largely on surrogates (e.g., serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, blood pressure, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, Glasgow coma scale, platelet count, respiratory rate). In contrast, a diagnosis such as myocardial infarction correlates serum markers (troponins, creatinine kinase subgroups) to functional studies (wall shortening on echocardiography, changes in electrocardiogram pattern) and anatomy (angiography, histology).",

Gold standards for each organ would correlate with available clinical findings (laboratory, imaging, functional assessment) which would then be correlated with clinical outcomes.

The need to avoid missing at-risk patients is an important consideration, especially in environments where a missed opportunity to intervene may have a strong effect on outcomes. Over-triage of patients who may not have sepsis or progress to develop sepsis risks wasting resources and exposing patients to the risks of unnecessary interventional therapies. At the same time, under-triage of patients runs the risk of late identification, which is associated with increased risk of death.

Models could be created from large databases and then prospectively validated in larger groups of patients. The impacts for diagnosis, treatment and outcomes should be prospectively assessed. Importantly, investigation should address the question of whether septic shock needs to be treated differently than sepsis outside of the institution of vasopressors. Investigation should not rely on an outcome (mortality) that is both the independent variable (used when creating the definitions to differentiate the two entities) and the dependent variable (the most common outcome used in clinical intervention studies). Finally, the clinical criteria for septic shock in Sepsis 3 should be prospectively validated.",

The construct validity is based on limited, but clinically available, criteria (SOFA or qSOFA score \u2265 2, suspected infection) and validated to a few outcomes. At the bedside, clinicians draw on a larger collection of data to make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.

In addition, qSOFA has fairly robust validity in predicting mortality and prolonged stay in patients prior to ICU admission (although its accuracy is lower in the ICU) [112, 115\u2013117]. However, both mortality and increased length of ICU stay are themselves influenced by clinical decision making. Many important clinical outcomes, such as cognitive dysfunction and lasting organ dysfunctions, have not been studied. It is also unclear if the variables or specific elements in SOFA need updating.

Sepsis performance improvement programs should optimally have multiprofessional representation (physicians, nurses, advanced practice providers, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, nutrition support specialists, administrators). Successful programs should include protocol development and implementation, targeted metrics to be evaluated, data collection, and ongoing feedback to facilitate continuous performance improvement. Ideally, sepsis performance improvement programs should be sustained over time with repeated assessment of key metrics and additional intervention if there is a failure to \u201chold the gain\u201d.

Risk stratification and prognostication in sepsis is of particular importance because high-risk patients may benefit from earlier clinical interventions, whereas low-risk patients may benefit from not undergoing unnecessary procedures. Prognostication in sepsis is currently done mostly via clinical criteria (e.g., organ dysfunction and/or presence of shock) and blood lactate levels. While numerous biomarkers have been evaluated in sepsis, none has sufficient accuracy to be utilized in clinical practice. The most commonly used biomarker in septic patients is procalcitonin, but its utility (though still debated) is predominantly to discontinue antibiotics in septic patients when levels fall.

While this is obviously encouraging, this leads to an increase in the number of sepsis survivors globally, which represents an additional burden to the heath-care systems in terms of rehabilitation, long-term care and support to caregivers. It is important here to distinguish between acute mortality directly related to the initial insult and late (or post-acute) mortality in patients who survive after hospital discharge. The current knowledge about late sepsis-attributable mortality is limited. Select older data coming from high income countries suggest that sepsis survivors have worse long-term outcomes [138, 139]. A recent systematic review of 43 studies, among which only 16 had control arms to allow assessment of attributable mortality, failed to clearly demonstrate a causal relationship between sepsis and post-acute mortality [140]. This systematic review raised the alternative hypothesis that the increased mortality after sepsis was probably related to the pre-existing disease comorbidity. The review\u2019s conclusion was subsequently challenged by two well-designed studies. One study showed that mortality was increased, compared with matched non-hospitalized controls, non-septic infected hospitalized patients and patients admitted with sterile inflammatory conditions [141]. Another study demonstrated that septic patients had higher mortality than matched controls from the general population and subjects who were hospitalized for a non-septic cause [142]. Data from newer cohorts with appropriate controls have also shown that sepsis survivors have a higher risk of hospital readmission which is associated with an increased risk of death [143\u2013145]. Since some of these readmissions are caused by ambulatory care sensitive conditions [143], it is possible that some percentage of these readmissions is preventable.",

            "text": "It is useful to organize the broad domain of morbidity in terms of the Post-Intensive Care Syndrome framework [146], which divides post-critical illness morbidity into (a) cognitive impairment; (b) emotional impairments; and (c) physical disability; as well as (d) increases in specific disease states. There are data to suggest sepsis causes an acute and enduring worsening of cognitive function among survivors [147, 148]. There are conflicting data on emotional impairment with some studies suggesting increased rates of psychiatric diagnoses [149] and others suggesting little change in rates of self-reported depressive symptoms [150] albeit with elevated pre-sepsis symptom burden. Multiple cohorts describe a clear high burden of psychological problems among survivors, including anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, regardless of whether it is pre-existing, unmasked, or truly caused by the sepsis or other critical illness [151\u2013154]. These data are indirect, however, as they come from non-septic critically ill patients or exclusively elderly septic patients. Disability rates also appear to be increased for years in survivors of sepsis compared to their pre-ICU levels, at least among older Americans and are high in many populations, driving poor measured health-related quality of life [148, 155\u2013158]. While there have been no systematic efforts to map the specific conditions for which septic patients are at increased risk, there are suggestions of increased rates of malignancy, readmissions for a new sepsis episode, high rates of new cardiovascular diseases and residual immune dysregulations [142, 143, 159\u2013163]. Many septic patients develop new comorbidities such as chronic kidney failure, the mechanisms of which may be different than in patients with non-septic acute kidney injury [164]. Other potential sepsis-associated long term consequences include frailty and an altered microbiome [165, 166]. Unfortunately, many studies in this domain are vulnerable to biases from insufficient characterization of pre-sepsis levels and trajectories of illness [167].",

Finally, low and middle-income countries harbor 85% of all sepsis cases.

Next, understanding the causes of readmission could potentially lead to the determination of preventable causes.

In 16 studies reported in a systematic review with non-sepsis controls, the main predictor variables for post-acute mortality were age, male sex, tobacco use, health-care associated pneumonia, use of immunosuppressant drugs, HIV infection, cancer, previous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease and the degree of organ dysfunction [140]. However, even in well-controlled studies, it is difficult to identify among these factors those related to the sepsis-attributable mortality. A recent controlled study showed that late excess mortality was higher in patients with 3 or more organ dysfunctions, even after adjusting for acute mortality differences [141]. Another recent study observed these [141] effects were significantly higher in male patients, younger patients, those with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, those with higher numbers of organ failure, those admitted to intensive care units, those with shock, and those who required mechanical ventilatory support [142].",

For instance, some conditions (e.g. acute hypoxic respiratory failure) may be difficult to manage in the inpatient setting, but not strongly associated with worse long-term outcomes among those who survive the acute setting [169].

Credible in-hospital interventions for which long-term consequences should be considered include (but are not limited to) (a) sepsis screening and detection strategies, (b) ICU triage and use of ICU, about which there is conflicting evidence in terms of short-term mortality in the United States and France, at least among elderly patients [173, 174], (c) alternative antibiotic regimens, including empiric strategies, culture guidance, and de-escalation strategies, and the ABCDEF bundle [175].

            "text": "What is known The optimal strategy for rehabilitation programs and post discharge outpatient clinics aiming to improve quality of life and long-term sepsis mortality is unknown. Two trials that addressed this issue in critically ill patients (not specifically with sepsis) failed to show improved outcomes [176, 177]. Hospital readmissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions are more common after sepsis than after matched controls, suggesting that effective outpatient care might have an impact in reducing re-hospitalization and, consequently, might influence long-term morbidity and mortality [143]. Despite a relative paucity of evidence to support their use, there is growing use of practices targeting the critically ill, which will, by definition, capture many septic patients. In the United Kingdom, the NICE guidelines recommend a post-ICU follow-up review after 2\u20133 months for all adult patients who stayed in critical care for more than 4 days and were at risk of morbidity [178]. They also state that health care systems should ensure that any adult who has had a critical care stay can be reassessed if they self-refer at any time. A model integrating early, time-limited post-ICU follow-up (including nurses, physicians, physical therapists, pharmacists, social workers, and peer support) is also being disseminated across Scotland [179]. In the United States, there is growing interest in both post-ICU clinics and post-ICU peer support models [180]. A growing number of United States hospitals report focusing on sepsis as part of the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) program Partnership for Patients that aims to a 12% reduction in 30-day readmissions [181].",

            "text": "What is known Specific functional abnormalities have been reported in essentially all tissues/organs following sepsis. Some evidence suggests that sepsis causes a global defect in a basic sub-cellular function that could lead to the development of dysfunction in many different cell types irrespective of their specific function or location. For example, a defect in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation has been demonstrated in multiple cell types [182\u2013184]. The resulting energy deficit could disable cell-specific functions. Conversely, each cell or type of cell may develop a specific defect or manifest dysfunction in a unique manner. For example, secretory function in monocytes and lymphocytes increases, elevating cytokine production [185], while elaboration/release of surfactant or surfactant proteins by type 2 pulmonary epithelial cells [186\u2013188] or of hormones by endocrine or pituitary cells decrease [189\u2013192]. Similarly, apoptosis increases in lymphocytes, dendritic cells and the gut epithelium, while apoptosis is delayed following sepsis in neutrophils (and is unaffected in multiple other cell types) [193\u2013196]. Finally, dysfunction in a single type of cell that is present in virtually all organs could underlie cell- and organ-specific dysfunction. For example, endothelial cells, which are present in all tissues, actively produce inflammatory mediators and coagulation intermediaries during sepsis, and contribute to sepsis-induced vascular dysfunction and leak [197, 198].",

            "text": "What is known Sepsis dramatically alters bio-energetics and/or metabolism [199, 200]. Sepsis increases metabolic rate, as reflected in oxygen consumption and overall substrate utilization [201]. However, this is paradoxically associated with a reduction in ATP utilization in many tissues, which occurs in concert with maintenance of ATP abundance, suggesting that the decreased use reflects an attempt to conserve ATP availability [202, 203]. Decreased activity in electron transport chain complexes I, III, IV and ATP synthase has also been demonstrated [183, 184]. Sepsis is also known to alter substrate preference, with a decrease in the utilization of glucose (glucose intolerance) relative to fat and protein [204, 205]. As a result, septic patients tend to be hyperglycemic. In later stages oxidation of fatty acids may also be impaired, as reflected in elevated serum levels of lipoproteins, free fatty acids and triglycerides. Glycolysis is favored over oxidative phosphorylation despite adequate oxygen availability (\u201caerobic glycolysis\u201d, sometimes called the Warburg Effect) [206\u2013208]. There is accelerated catabolism of skeletal muscle and perhaps smooth muscle as well [209]. In addition, micronutrient (e.g., vitamins, trace metals) effects are also impaired, reflecting either deficiency or altered activity [210, 211]. In addition, abnormalities are noted in the level and/or effectiveness of most hormones in sepsis [192].",

            "text": "What is known The microbiome contains 40 trillion organisms, the same number of cells as in the host patient [212]. While the majority of bacterial species and diversity of the microbiome reside within the gut lumen, the microbiome includes all microorganisms residing within (mouth, lungs, gut) or on (skin) the host. Microbial diversity is enormous with 1000 different species of bacteria and over 2 million bacterial genes [212, 213]. Sepsis leads to a rapid (within 6 h) decrease in microbial diversity [214]. Whereas the most common microbe makes up 25% of the microbiome in healthy patients, a massive diversity crash causes results in the most common microbe making up 95% of the microbiome in ICU patients [215]. These changes appear to result from both the underlying disorder (sepsis) and its treatment (antibiotics), which by definition alter the microbiome [216\u2013222]. Further, microbes alter their virulence in response to both the internal host environment (availability of phosphate) and treatments in critically ill patients (opiates) [223\u2013225]. Bacteria in pre-clinical models of sepsis can be tricked into \u201cbelieving\u201d that the host environment is non-toxic, preventing the development of virulence factors that would ordinarily occur in sepsis, leading to survival advantage in septic rodents [226]. Microbes also possess the capacity for quorum sensing in which individual cells can work together to collectively respond to the environment [227, 228].",

In spite of this, it is implicitly understood by clinicians that cells and organ systems must recover over time in sepsis survivors despite the absence of therapy aimed at cellular/organ recovery. The study of mechanisms behind recovery in sepsis has only recently become an area of focus in basic/translational sepsis research, and thus relatively little is understood. Intrinsic to recovery is the return of function at subcellular, cellular, and multicellular/organ levels, and within the immune, metabolic, endocrine, intestinal, vascular, neurologic, etc. systems. Recovery may be affected by specific mediators and systems that participate in the initiation and development of sepsis-associated responses. Examples include lipids (resolvins, lipoxins, maresins, prostanoids), autophagy, miRNAs, exosomes, and neuronal activity [190, 229\u2013235].",

A 2017 research agenda by 11 international experts in septic shock listed 10 topics to undergo testing over the next 10 years [236]. A 2015 research roadmap by 13 international authors proposed research topics on a wide array of subjects ranging from epidemiology to molecular diagnostics [237]. It is logical that there should be some overlap between the priorities in the different manuscripts, and although each of the potential questions for this manuscript were developed independently of the other two, each previously enumerated priority is proposed in some fashion in the current recommendations. This suggests there is some degree of international consensus regarding sepsis research priorities, and multiple international groups are actively performing research on these priorities. However, the priority list detailed herein additionally includes topics that have been little covered in past efforts, including post-ICU and is broader in scope.",

However, even if all existing best practice standards were followed, significant knowledge gaps remain on a wide array of issues.
