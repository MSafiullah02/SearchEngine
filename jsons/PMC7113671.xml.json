CHIKV, a member of genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae, was first isolated from Tanzania in 1952 (Thiberville et al., 2013). CHIKV is now recognized as a global arboviral threat as numerous major outbreaks were reported from both old and new world since 2005. (Powers, 2015). CHIKV infection in humans is characterized by both acute and chronic form of illness. Acute CHIKV infection is characterised by abrupt onset of fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, rash, myalgia and severe arthralgia. Acute-phase symptoms usually disappear after 2 weeks. However, arthralgia and/or myalgia may persist for weeks, months, or even years in some patients. The persistence of CHIKV in joints may be a characteristic of chronic illness (Simon et al., 2011, Labadie et al., 2010, Dupuis-Maguiraga et al., 2012). Severe complications including neurological involvement, mother-to-child transmission and even deaths were reported from recent outbreaks (Chandak et al., 2009, Gerardin et al., 2008).",

Multiple strategies involving tissue culture and animal model have been applied for generation of novel therapies against CHIKV (Abdelnabi et al., 2015). Contributing to the accelerating surge of drug discovery against CHIKV, we explored a novel RNA interference (RNAi) strategy to inhibit replication of CHIKV.",

Numerous studies involving RNAi have now been published and several RNAi drug candidates have entered clinical trials (Burnett et al., 2011, Davidson and McCray, 2011, Pecot et al., 2011). The last decade has witnessed a major advancement in RNAi based antiviral therapeutic approaches, demonstrating their efficacy against both acute and chronic viral infections, including Ebola virus, Influenza A virus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Hepatitis C virus and Hepatitis B virus etc. (Thi et al., 2015, Tompkins et al., 2004, Ge et al., 2004, Li et al., 2005, Haasnoot et al., 2007). RNAi therapeutics are primarily achieved by utilizing exogenous siRNA, vector-based shRNA or miRNA approaches. RNAi targeting CHIKV using siRNA and shRNA has already been reported (Dash et al., 2008, Parashar et al., 2013, Lam et al., 2012). Artificial miRNA (amiRNA) based approach is now gaining importance owing to its advantages over siRNA and shRNA in terms of increased stability, effectiveness, and lower toxicity (Boudreau et al., 2009, Maczuga et al., 2012, McBride et al., 2008, Xie et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Like natural endogenous miRNAs, amiRNAs are expressed from exogenously transfected plasmid miRNA construct by RNA polymerase II. Primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are transcribed and are trimmed by the microprocessor complex made up of Drosha (RNase III) and DCGR8 in the nucleus into \u223c70 nucleotide stem-loop precursors, called pre-miRNAs. Following this, pre-amiRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm via exportin-5, where they are recognized by RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Pre-amiRNAs are then cleaved into mature amiRNAs by Dicer. The two strands of amiRNA are separated, and the guide strand, complementary to viral gene remains associated with Ago2 which orient it for interaction with the target viral RNA (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009, Davidson and McCray, 2011, Fischer and James, 2004, Kim and Rossi, 2007, van Rij and Andino, 2006). Target viral RNA is subsequently degraded or translationally inhibited, resulting in post-transcriptional silencing of viral replication. Recently, effectiveness of amiRNA was reported for inhibition of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), which is a member of genus alphavirus (Bhomia et al., 2013).",

Results revealed that amiRNA either as single or in combination against different targets, can efficiently inhibit CHIKV replication. Growing studies suggest that combinatorial therapy holds significant promise over mono-therapies as it helps to maximize efficacy and minimize the risk of escape mutants. We, therefore, blend our amiRNA based RNAi approach with other classical inhibitors of CHIKV.

The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the RNA load in virus control was log106.5 and log108.2 at 24 and 48 hpi respectively. The CHIKV RNA was log105.8, log105.4, log105.5 and log103.5 in amiRNA_A, amiRNA_B, amiRNA_C and amiRNA_D treated cells respectively at 24 hpi. Similarly, at 48 hpi, the viral RNA transcripts were log107.9, log107.6, log107.7 and log106.8 in amiRNA_A, amiRNA_B, amiRNA_C and amiRNA_D respectively. The relative expression of CHIKV RNA is shown in Fig. 2\nA. The highest reduction of CHIKV RNA was observed in amiRNA_D treated cells, followed by amiRNA_B, amiRNA_C and amiRNA_A.

            "text": "Success of RNAi based therapeutics suggests that it can suppress viral replication very efficiently (Ibrisimovic et al., 2013, Jacque et al., 2002, van Rij and Andino, 2006). However, there is an apprehension that amiRNA based RNAi may face the same obstacles as seen by other mono-therapies in the past, leading to the development of resistance. To address this concern, the study was further extended to evaluate the inhibitory effect of amiRNA in combination with conventional antiviral drugs like chloroquine and ribavirin against CHIKV infection. The inhibitory effect of chloroquine-amiRNA combination was found much greater than individual compounds. This could be due to the fact that the combination of these two compounds led to targeting of the virus life cycle at both early and late stage by chloroquine and amiRNA respectively. Chloroquine interferes with fusion of viral E1 protein with endosomal membrane by raising the endosomal pH whereas, amiRNA acts through post-transcriptional silencing of viral replication. Earlier, ribavirin in combination with INF-\u03b1 and doxycycline, revealed synergistic inhibitory effect against CHIKV (Briolant et al., 2004, Rothan et al., 2015). However, in this study, ribavirin-amiRNA combination did not exhibit desired effect compared to both ribavirin and amiRNA. The major mechanism of ribavirin is to inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase enzyme (IMPDH), resulting in the depletion of intracellular GTP pool (Khan et al., 2011, Abdelnabi et al., 2015). Thus, ribavirin might interfere with the miRNA pathway as well, which also require cellular nucleotide pool for its expression. Nevertheless, we tested this possibility by using another nucleotide analogue mycophenolic acid and found similar result. Collectively, these results indicate, use of inhibitors of viral genome replication in combination with amiRNAs, may interfere with the expression of amiRNAs resulting in ineffective suppression of viral replication. However, combining amiRNA based RNAi approach with a suitable early viral replication inhibitor will significantly help in suppression of viral replication (Fig. 5\n).",

Intravenous delivery protected animals from death, including those that received treatment even after the onset of ebola infection (Thi et al., 2015). In this study, we have used lipofectamine based protocol for in vitro transfection. Nevertheless, lipid-based delivery for RNAi have yielded successful advances in vivo and to an extent in clinical trials (Bobbin and Rossi, 2016, Dong et al., 2014, Torrecilla et al., 2014, Wittrup and Lieberman, 2015). Moreover, RNAi therapeutic (TKM-Ebola) has also been successfully used during 2014 Ebola epidemic in Western Africa (Bobbin and Rossi, 2016). All these reports confirm the potential utility of RNAi in acute viral infections. Further, plasmid DNA as a vector for gene therapy has been successfully employed in arthritis model using various physical and chemical methods. Delivery of plasmid DNA in arthritis gene therapy showed its promise as a therapeutic strategy, which may be further explored for the systemic delivery of amiRNA, particularly during chronic phase of CHIKV infection in humans (Evans et al., 2006, Subang and Gould, 2010).",

The efficient in vitro inhibition of CHIKV replication by amiRNA makes it a promising candidate for development of anti-CHIKV therapeutics. Targeting of the conserved sequences across all the genotypes of CHIKV makes it an excellent candidate. Combinatorial RNAi will further give the insights about the rational selection of combination regimes in the future. However, the efficacy of these amiRNAs remains to be tested in vivo. Although our knowledge of RNAi therapeutics and combination therapy has increased in the recent years, but several important issues must be studied carefully like safe delivery methods, immune response, dose of combinations, etc., if this knowledge is to be extended further for the development of anti-CHIKV therapeutics.",
