Approximately 2.4 million cases have been reported up to date, including approximately 83.000 confirmed cases in Turkey [2] . The prominent symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and fatigue, as well as hemoptysis, and dyspnea. In severe cases, patients develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac problems, and multiple organ failure [4] . Besides, they also have neuro-invasive abilities and might spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system [3, 4] . It was recently shown that some patients with COVID-19 have neurological symptoms, such as headache, anosmia, dysgesia, dizziness, and impaired consciousness [4, 5] . COVID-19 may also predispose cerebrovascular diseases due to excessive inflammation, immobilization, hypoxia, and diffuse intravascular coagulation [6] . In this case report, 4 patients with COVID-19 were reported to be simultaneously accompanied by neurological involvement of acute ischemic stroke independently of the critical disease process. Although the pathophysiology of the neurological signs caused by COVID-19 have not been investigated in a detailed manner, the spectrum and intensities of these manifestations need to be explored.",

However, the clinical and radiological severity of Covid-19 infection in these patients were similar. There is a doubt regarding the increased inflammatory response underlying the abnormal blood coagulation in early stage of cerebrovascular diseases. It could also be speculated that Covid-19 patients were more prone to stroke, and the most accompanying comorbidity was hypertension. Our cases with anterior system infarction had higher D-dimer levels. Although our number of cases was limited, the severity of stroke offers an insight that it may vary depending on D-dimer levels.",
