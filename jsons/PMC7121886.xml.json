However, at present, the development of vaccines to the point of licensing for human use takes decades and sometimes has proven hardly possible as exemplified by the HIV pandemic. To minimize the time for vaccine development and to be safe, it is necessary to develop strategies that allow for the immediate initiation of standardized vaccine development, leading to successful and safe candidate vaccines in a minimal amount of time. One strategy is to use well-known, already authorized vaccines with exceptional safety and efficacy records as a platform to present critical antigens of the pathogen which is the focus of vaccine development. Thereby, efficacious immune responses are triggered in immunized animals and patients not only against the vaccine vector, but also against the additionally present extra antigen. One of these potential vaccine platforms currently under development are recombinant vaccine strain-derived measles viruses.",

Besides revealing an excellent safety record, both humoral and cellular immune responses are elicited, which are responsible for long-lasting protection [1\u20133]. Therefore, the WHO targets eradication of measles by using these vaccines [4]. The vaccine\u2019s manufacturing process is extremely well established [5] and millions of doses can be generated quite easily and quickly. Generation of recombinant MV from DNA via reverse genetics became feasible [5] and allows for the robust expression of different antigens, as outlined below, during replication of the modified recombinant MV vaccine viruses.",

The (codon-optimized) ORF encompassing START and STOP codons is flanked by the respective restriction sites, which allow direct cloning of the gene segment into the ATU of a full-length MV genome plasmid. It may be necessary to include a specific number of extra nucleotides between STOP codon and 3\u00b4restriction site to obey the rule-of-six (see\nNote\n3).Alternatively, the desired ORF is amplified on the basis of (plasmid) cDNA or cDNA directly isolated (eventually after reverse transcription) from the target pathogens\u2019 genomes using (RT-)PCR\n. For this purpose, specific primers have to be designed as outlined above, depending on the exact structure of the ATU and the ORF to be amplified.The resulting cDNA segments as well as the MV genome plasmids are then treated by the respective restriction endonucleases using the following standard reaction mix:1\u201310 \u03bcg DNA.5\u201310 U per restriction enzyme\n.5 \u03bcl 10\u00d7 NEB buffer (depending on the enzyme used).5 \u03bcl 10\u00d7 BSA (if required by the applied enzyme).Fill up to 50 \u03bcl with nuclease-free H2O.\n\nDNA digestions proceeds at the temperature required by the respective enzymes to allow thorough digestion of the DNA, optimally overnight.\n3.The desired segments are purified after restriction digestion by standard agarose gel electrophoresis (see\nNote\n4).

The challenge relies on an established infection protocol of (unvaccinated) animals, which results in symptomatic infections or even death, thereby allowing to test the protective capacity of the vaccine. Parameters such as course of disease or pathogen load in specific organs are assed (see\nNote\n25).\n",

            "text": "\nBoth examples pBR-MVvac2-GFP (H) and p(+)PolII-MVvac2-ATU(P) contain, as all genome plasmids for the rescue\nof recombinant MV, a full-length MV vaccine strain genome. pBR-MVvac2-GFP (H) is derived from the plasmid backbone pBR322 (low copy) and expresses the viral RNA antigenome under the control of a T7-promoter, whereas p(+)PolII-MVvac2-ATU(P) has a pBluescript (high copy) backbone and is PolII-driven\n. Plasmids containing full-length MV genomes tend to be a bit delicate to handling procedures. Therefore, plasmids with a high-copy plasmid backbone should be amplified in at 30 \u00b0C, whereas low-copy plasmids can be amplified at 37 \u00b0C. In addition, it pays to directly pick clones or isolate plasmids from growing cultures instead of storing liquid bacteria cultures or colony plates with MV genome-containing plasmids at 4 \u00b0C for more than few hours (\u226a overnight!). As an alternative, bacteria pellets can be stored frozen at \u221220 \u00b0C before plasmid isolation.Each MV gene cassette is flanked by conserved genetic elements representing start and stop signals for the viral polymerase complex. By duplicating these highly conserved intergenic sequences, a new transcription unit can be inserted in virtually any position of the virus genome, allowing insertion and expression of foreign genes such as antigen ORFs . The relative genomic position of the ATU allows regulation of the inserted gene\u2019s expression due to the transcriptional gradient found in Mononegavirales. The further upstream the ATU cassette is located, the higher the amount of mRNA being transcribed in infected cells and the higher protein expression. However, if the encoded gene product interferes with MV replication, too high expression levels of the encoded antigen may be detrimental.The number of nucleotides in MV genomes can be exactly divided by 6, presumably due to one N protein binding to six nucleotides. Also recombinant genomes have to obey this rule; otherwise no recombinant virus can be rescued. Therefore, it has to be considered that the length of the inserted gene segment can be divided with the same rest by 6 as the length of the segment removed from the genome during cloning, if gene cassettes are inserted into genome plasmids. Thereby, one makes sure that the length of the resulting full-length genome is multiple of 6, again.Due to the size of the genome\n-containing plasmid (approx. 20 kDa), voltage during agarose gel electrophoresis should be restricted to max. 70 V.While T7-based rescue of MV, especially using the helper cell line 293-3-46, is the standard rescue system guaranteeing precise start and stop of the transcribed anti-genomic viral RNA due to the precise start of T7-driven transcription and stop due to specific termination signals in conjunction with the ribozyme flanking the viral genome sequences [5], efficiency of the rescue is quite variable and depends considerably on the status of the rescue cells. Moreover, syncytia formation using 293-3-46 cells after overlay is not too efficient [5], further limiting rescue efficiency especially of virus variants with limited fusion activity (unpublished own observation). Vaccinia Virus driven rescue allows usage of cell lines other than 293, which may be better suited for propagation of one specific MV variant, but depends on the quality of the used plasmids. PolII-driven virus rescue is very efficient and usually results in recombinant MV with precise genomes, but the lower precision of start and stop of Poll II transcription may allow completion of virus from genomes not being in line with the rule of six [46].Prepare one more six-well plate than required for the rescue of the different MV. This additional well is used as transfection control.Seal six-well plate properly to avoid contamination of the cells.If the recombinant MV will additionally express GFP or other fluorescent marker proteins, check for GFP-expression with the help of a fluorescence microscope to identify syncytia. If no easy marker protein for easy evaluation is encoded, check for syncytia formation via light microscope in phase contrast.For transfection control\n, use 4 \u03bcg of for example EGFP expression plasmids such as pEGFP-N1 without any MV cDNA or helper-plasmids and transfect as described for MV cDNA.If using another Vaccinia Virus than MVA for T7 Pol expression, one has to make sure that the rescued recombinant MV can be separated from (co-) replicating Vaccinia Virus, which may be a tedious process due to the laborious methods needed to physically separate the different virus populations.\nStep 2 seems to be slightly more efficient in our hands, but it includes one additional freeze\u2013thaw cycle.After quick-freezing in liquid nitrogen, the tube containing the virus suspension can be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for several days.Check thawing of the virus regularly, the virus is heat sensitive and incubating the virus at 37 \u00b0C will lead to significantly reduced virus titers.It is essential to slew the cell culture dish immediately as well as properly to avoid erratic infection of Vero cells, which will lead to lower virus titers.The growth rate is depending on the virus strain and might be modulated by the additional genetic information. Therefore, check the virus growth regularly to develop a feeling for the growth rate.Scratch the cells to on edge of the cell culture dish and hold the plate inclined while aspirating the medium\nincluding all cell debris.While MV vaccine strains authorized to be used as human vaccines are usually regarded as safe and accordingly being handled under BSL-1 conditions, recombinant viruses\u2014even those bearing identical vaccine strain genomes\u2014may be handled under BSL-1 or BSL-2 conditions depending\non the locally responsible national or regional regulatory authorities. Under very rare circumstances, single recombinant MV may be placed into BSL-3, depending on the nature of the expressed foreign antigen.Try to remove the medium completely while following Note\n16. This will increase virus titers.The number of aliquots can be modified, depending on freezer-space and experimental plans.For passages >P5 it is sufficient to infect only one 15 cm dish and store around five aliquots, because those viruses are not used for experiments, normally.Slew the plate gently a few times during incubation.Slew the plate vigorously a few times during incubation.Experimental mouse work has to be carried out in compliance with the regulations of the respective animal protection law.Mice are sacrificed or used for further studies dependent on the respective experimental schedule.Efficacy of the recombinant vaccines can be most directly assessed using a challenge\nexperiment directly revealing protection by abolishing or attenuating the etiopathology. In absence of an appropriate challenge, quantitative abundance of antigen-specific (neutralizing) antibodies or T cell reactivity can indicate the protective efficacy of the recombinant vaccine.\n",
