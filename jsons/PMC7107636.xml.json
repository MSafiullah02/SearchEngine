In addition, azole resistant A. fumigatus strains have been increasingly frequent in several geographical regions, and given low rate of positive cultures, these cases risk to remain undetected, compromising the outcome of IA.5",

In particular, for probable IA, a combination of a host factor (presence of a predisposing condition) plus a clinical criterion plus a mycological criterion are required. Clinical criteria in cases of pulmonary IA include one of the following typical radiological lesions in lung computed tomography (CT) scan: (1) dense, well-circumscribed lesions(s) with or without a halo sign, (2) air-crescent sign, or (3) cavity. Mycological criteria for pulmonary aspergillosis are detection of galactomannan (GM) in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) or direct tests positive in sputum or BAL.6 Possible IA is diagnosed in the presence of host and clinical criteria but in the absence of mycological documentation.",

Indeed, 50% of patients in this group with a positive PCR did receive empirically mould active agents, so only in remaining 50% of them, positive PCR could be confidently considered as false positive results or colonisation.

However, they do not contain a control of DNA extraction, which may differ for hyphae and for free DNA, and quality control for the BAL itself. Additionally, their performance depends on the assay used and the clinical setting. The low value obtained in our study is not comparable with most of the performances described to date in the literature using MycoGenie\u00ae. However, most other studies included patients with high rate of culture-positive respiratory samples. Indeed, the sensitivity was 92.9% in a cohort with 59 of 88 respiratory samples positive in culture for Aspergillus,14 71% in 31 cases of probable IA with 45% of positive BAL culture rate,18 and 77.4% in case of fungal rhinosinusitis in which a high concentration of fungus DNA is present.19 Also a recent study comparing various diagnostic methods, which reported the sensitivity of MycoGenie\u00ae of 73.7% in 38 patients with proven/probable IA, had a very high (22/38, 58%) rate of positivity of culture for Aspergillus.12 In addition, in that cohort, the sensitivity was lower in 41 hematological patients than in those from intensive care unit (ICU) suggesting a lower fungal burden sufficient to cause IFD in highly immunocompromised hosts.12 Indeed, also the low yield of fungal cultures and rather low median BAL GM ODI confirm the low burden of viable moulds in this study. Therefore, the performance of MycoGenie\u00ae in a cohort of with low fungal burden remains to be established. Another explanation for low sensitivity of this qPCR, even in a subgroup of BAL GM positive patients with probable IA, might be the infection with species other than A. fumigatus which are not detected by this assay.",

            "text": "A very interesting factor which influenced sensitivity in our cohort was the presence of mould active treatment at the time of BAL, which increased the sensitivity from 24% to 61%. One possible explanation is that mould active agents caused lysis of the fungal wall with a higher percentage of free DNA detectable in the respiratory tree, particularly in the supernatant of a centrifuged BAL sample, which was the part used in this study.20 The availability of free fungal DNA would result in much better sensitivity of DNA extraction, which is a critical process for the performance of fungal PCR.16 This observation is indirectly confirmed by cohorts reporting higher performance of PCR, both in BAL and serum, in those receiving mould active agents.21\u201323 Also in our study, the rate of qPCR positivity in GM positive BAL samples was higher form patients receiving mould active drugs compared to those not treated. Better specification which portion of BAL fluid should be used might be warranted, since by testing supernatant, DNA still within the organism or phagocytic host cells might not be detected.",

Although in case of fungi other than Aspergillus co-infection might be present, it is unlikely based on negative BAL GM. On the contrary, cases of cross-reactivity of the method with strains of A. flavus have already been described in the literature,23 and such a false positive result might be particularly likely in case of high fungal burden, as demonstrated in our two cases. From the clinical point of view, a qPCR should detect all species of Aspergilllus, since species other than A. fumigatus might be more prevalent, particularity in some geographical zones, for example, A. flavus in Mediterranean.24",

Although molecular methods are important tools, in addition to culture, to monitor the changes in resistance patters, also in this case, detection of more than one resistance mutation might be useful. Finally, the absence of detected mutations does not exclude antifungal resistance in case of clinical failure since various mutation patterns can occur, particularly in case of previous azole exposure.",
