            "text": "Despite decades of research, a tolerable and effective HIV-1 vaccine is still unavailable. The barriers to achieving this goal include overcoming HIV-1 envelope (Env) sequence diversity to rapidly elicit protective broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and nonneutralizing humoral and cellular responses.1, 2, 3 In the early years of HIV vaccinology, vaccine development proceeded along traditional pathways that focused on the humoral arm of the immune system4 as other successful preventive vaccines used antibody binding and function as their correlates of protection.5 In fact, the classic approach of isolating, inactivating, and injecting whole or partial microorganisms that cause disease had been successfully used since 1796,6, 7, 8 and such approaches were initially attempted for HIV-1. For example, a 1999 mouse study using formaldehyde-inactivated virions was promising,9 but subsequent analysis found the result to be an artifact.10 Attenuated HIV-1 was seriously considered as a vaccine candidate until long-term results of naturally occurring attenuated HIV-1 infection, such as the nef deleted strain infecting the Sydney Blood Bank Cohort,11 produced evidence of immunologic damage.12 A concerted effort for vaccine testing was undertaken by the AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group and Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group. These consortia, along with several other groups, conducted early-phase HIV-1 vaccine studies using recombinant HIV-1 gp160 or gp120 subunit proteins as immunogens. Results of these trials were generally discouraging because they suggested tolerability but not efficacy.13, 14, 15 Regardless, some immunogens proceeded toward efficacy trials as early as 1999.",

In particular, the San Francisco\u2013based VaxGen Inc completed 2 Phase IIb/III trials in men who have sex with men and women (VAX004) and intravenous drug users (VAX003). Both studies assessed a protein-based vaccine (AIDSVAX) that contained gp120 proteins from various HIV-1 subtypes.16\n,\n17 The results of VAX004 were again disappointing, with an HIV-1 infection rate of 6.7% in the vaccinated group compared with 7.0% in the placebo group. As in VAX003, there was no demonstrable efficacy, and neither had a significant effect on viral load or CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts in those persons who did become infected with HIV-1.16\n,\n17 Despite these discouraging results, there was pressure to advance vaccine science for HIV-1, including the establishment of the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and programs to incentivize commercial vaccine development.18 In this political environment, a decision was made to undertake the RV144 Phase III efficacy trial, which was designed to reassess AIDSVAX in a heterologous prime-boost strategy.19\n,\n20 This trial involved priming the immune system with a canarypox-based vector that contained genetically engineered versions of HIV-1 env, gag, and pol genes (ALVAC) and boosting with ALVAC and the alum-adjuvanted protein vaccine AIDSVAX. This trial was highly controversial because multiple early-phase clinical trials revealed that the components were poorly immunogenic when given in isolation.21, 22, 23, 24, 25 Proponents argued that the trial provided an opportunity to test the feasibility of the prime-boost design and to test for cellular immune correlates of protection,22 whereas opponents emphasized the excessive cost of the trial and the high likelihood of failure because of its use of immunogens that had previously induced only modest T-cell and humoral responses with no evidence of broad virus neutralization when administered alone or in combination.22\n,\n23 There was little optimism that this strategy would succeed.",

These immunologic studies provided clues about which parts of the immune response might be contributing to vaccine-mediated protection. For example, sieve analysis of HIV-1\u2013infected vaccine recipients identified which portions of the immune response appeared to be placing pressure on the virus, and these results have now begun to drive immunogen design.41, 42, 43 Several ongoing efficacy trials are being conducted to better understand the results of the RV144 trial, including HVTN 702 and 705. The HVTN 702 study aims to enroll >5000 participants to assess the tolerability and immune response to ALVAC and bivalent subtype C gp120 adjuvanted with MF59 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02968849), and The HVTN 705 study (Imbokodo, Bloemfontein, South Africa) aims to assess a heterologous prime boost regimen using Ad26.Mos4.HIV and Clade C gp140 adjuvanted with aluminum phosphate (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03060629).",

The eOD was simultaneously able to activate select germline-targeting B cells and guide early somatic mutation toward mature bNAb development.95 The team's self-assembling nanoparticles displayed 60 copies of the eOD in an effort to improve B-cell activation and lymph node trafficking.95 The sixth iteration of this germline-targeting construct was successful in activating germline and mature VRC01-class B cells,95 and a newer variant, germline targeting version 8 (eOD-GT8), had higher affinity for VRC01 class B-cell precursors.99 In a transgenic mouse model, almost 30% of mice were able to activate VRC01 B-cell precursors and produce a VRC01-class memory response after receiving one immunization using eOD-GT8.101 Subsequent in vitro studies with human samples had the ability of eOD-GT8 to prime the human B-cell repertoire.102 Because eOD-GT8 has such a high affinity for VRC01-like B cells, it is possible that this immunogen could drive the expulsion of these B cells from germinal centers and force maturation into the short-lived plasma cell compartment. Should this occur, primed B cells would not be able to reenter germinal centers and undergo affinity maturation to develop neutralization breadth. Previous work with eOD-GT2, a lower-affinity version, highlighted potential issues with lower-affinity immunogens because this construct resulted in the development of a substantial endogenous mouse B-cell response that outcompeted the VRC01gHL cells.103 The eOD-GT8\u2013displaying nanoparticle is currently being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial sponsored by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and is estimated to close to accrual in 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03547245).",

            "text": "There is an increasing consensus that homologous prime-boost immunizations may not be effective in inducing bNAbs against HIV-1104 because of the protracted evolutionary pathways that bNAbs undergo in HIV-1\u2013infected persons. In addition, some bNAb characteristics suggest that a successful vaccine will need to overcome host immunoregulatory mechanisms that hinder formation of bNAbs, including, but not limited to, down selection of B-cells due to autoreactivity with host antigens.105 B-cell lineage vaccine strategies re-create the coevolutionary events of the Env and the humoral response by priming the immune system with an early transmitted form of Env and boosting with sequentially evolved Env variants to drive affinity maturation and bNAb development to select for rare lineages.59 The first of these designs was based on data from an HIV-1\u2013infected individual, CH505, where the co-evolution of the virus and the CH103 CD4-binding site bNAb lineage was observed106; this bNAb lineage neutralized 55% of tested HIV-1 isolates and had a lower level of somatic hypermutation compared with other bNAb lineages, making it an attractive vaccine target. The initial vaccine strategy used Env gp120 proteins that reacted most optimally with each step of the CH103 lineage (TF, week 53, week 78, and week 100).106 This concept is currently being evaluated in HVTN115, a 2-part study designed to assess the tolerability and immunogenicity of the EnvSeq-1 vaccine (CH505TF, week 53, week 78, and week 100) adjuvanted with glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant formulated in a stable emulsion. In part A, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups in a dose escalation test of the initial CH505TF immunogen, whereas in part B, participants are being randomly assigned to additive and sequential Env immunization strategies. This study design complements similar studies previously reported in rabbits107 and is expected to complete accrual in 2022 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03220724).",

As with other infectious diseases, such as diphtheria and hepatitis B where passive immunotherapy and active vaccination were combined to enhance protection, recombinant adenoassociated viruses and other passive therapies combined with active vaccination are likely to become important parts of a successful HIV vaccine strategy.",

We have learned that manipulating host controls of bNAb induction and displaying antigenic diversity to obtain neutralization breadth are all keys to developing a successful HIV-1 vaccine. One of the most substantial limitations to vaccine development is that we have not yet clearly defined the primary immune correlate(s) of protection against HIV-1 infection, although several potential correlates have been identified, including V1V2-specific IgG antibodies.40 What we have learned thus far is that the successful vaccine candidate will likely use a heterologous prime-boost strategy that engages both the humoral and cellular immune systems to provide neutralization breadth or include nonneutralization protective immune responses and durability. Even then, such vaccines may be only one piece of a complex puzzle that may involve a combination of active and passive immunization tools.",
