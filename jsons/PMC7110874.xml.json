            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common disease in cats caused by a virulent form of feline coronavirus (FCoV; Pedersen et al., 1981, Poland et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1998). The ability of FCoV to replicate inside macrophages is an essential virulence factor for the development of FIP (Dewerchin et al., 2005, Rottier et al., 2005). The disease is characterised by widespread immune-mediated vasculitis and/or pyogranulomas, manifesting as an effusive form, with high protein effusions in body cavities, or a non-effusive form (Wolfe and Griesemer, 1966, Montali and Strandberg, 1972, Pedersen, 1976). The effusive form of FIP is more common than the non-effusive form, although the relative prevalence of non-effusive cases appears to be increasing (Pedersen, 2009). FIP is usually fatal (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008).",

Clinical signs are often non-specific, hematological and biochemical abnormalities are not pathognomonic, and serological tests and PCR have relatively low diagnostic accuracy (Hartmann et al., 2003). The standard methods for diagnosis are histological examination (of biopsies, but more usually at postmortem examination) and immunohistochemical analysis of affected organs (Sparkes et al., 1991, Paltrinieri et al., 1999, Hartmann et al., 2003, Addie et al., 2004). Biopsies collected antemortem are usually not an option because of the risks of surgery in cats that are already in poor health (Addie et al., 2004). Collection of specimens using minimally invasive techniques, such as fine needle aspirates or needle core (Tru-cut) biopsies, can reduce the anesthetic risks, although these tests have poor sensitivity (Giordano et al., 2005).",

In the veterinary literature to date, there have been a limited number of feline effusion specimens where DIF test results have been compared to confirmation of FCoV infection status at postmortem examination (FIP negative and FIP positive cases) or survival for >12 months after testing (FIP negative cases) (Cammarata Parodi et al., 1993, n\n = 32; Hartmann et al., 2003, n\n = 171; Table 2).
