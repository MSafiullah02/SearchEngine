In the model presented below, these differences can be covered through ad hoc choices of a function, namely \u03c1, that can describe various types of contagion. We describe below some effects of care houses, that is of places where the virus spreads faster, in accelerating the infection. As a further example, we show the effects of different quarantine policies, only from the pandemic evolution point of view.

Indeed, we expect that infective individuals usually become known and, hence, isolated well before their conditions get too bad. Moreover, we expect that \u03ba is bigger at higher ages, since the presence of infective individuals that are not aware of their status (and, hence, are not isolated) might be larger at lower ages. Thus, we choose \u03ba as being only age dependent and, more precisely, we set 1 \u03ba(t, a, x) = 0.1 \u03c7 Recall that \u03ba plays a key role in the control of the epidemic and a paragraph below is devoted to show its relevance. The parameter \u03d1 is the speed at which infective individuals recover. It is realistic to assume that this happens at a rate faster than the death rate and, what is more relevant, faster for younger individuals. Thus, neglecting the dependence on time and space, we set \u03d1(t, a, x) = 0.8 \u03c7 Finally, \u03b7 is the speed at which hospitalized individuals recover.
