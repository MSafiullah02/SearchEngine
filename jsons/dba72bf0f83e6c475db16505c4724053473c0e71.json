The mode of analysis that our work takes up is that of questioning value and related categories as definite empirically perceived phenomena. We contend that the valuation of ecosystem services -even in its post-normal forms -and the ecosystem services framework not only fail to examine value-based categories, but reproduce the problematic aspects of value-based social relations, which ultimately bear on the ecological issues affecting the P\u00e1ramo. Upon this premise we set out to formalise a (computational) dialogical scenario where arguments stating distinct, and often contradictory, actions delineate possible forms of appropriating the P\u00e1ramo, while motivating the examination of their defining sociality.",

(2016) and Kumar and Kumar (2008) ). However, the sole invocation of the valorisation of value inherent in valuation -in any approach to valuation -induces a form of fetishistic use of value, i.e., the implicit subjectification of (the category of) value as an agent of social interaction -as an \"automatic subject\", as it were (Kurz, 2019). Therefore, a similar process of social reproduction is prompted by non-neoclassical approaches to VES -e.g., those employing non-monetary techniques under the principles of integral valuation (see, e.g., Jacobs et al. (2016) and G\u00f3mez-Baggethun et al. (2014)) -so long as valuation is constituted as an affirmative action around the category of value.",

We maintain that within this process, VES acts as a form of theoretical praxis furthering value fetishism towards the constitution of the valorisation of value as an inexorable mandate to which everyone within its orbit must conform under the penalty of (economic) ostracism. We trace the root of this assimilation process to the making of a consistent world, i.e., one that does not contradict capitalist social praxis, by means of a narrative of the conservation and protection of nature through its rational exploitation (see, e.g., MEA (2005) and Lliso et al. (2020)). Hence, we examine the rationality behind the decisions made in a community-based organization of local farmers embracing the relations of value-dissociation within the Guantiva-La Rusia P\u00e1ramo, employing a paraconsistent logical model of discursive analysis that reveals the immanent contradictions and material implications of the conscious reshaping of their sociality.",

ESF thus beckons the valuation of ecosystem services (VES) as a means to signalling nature's contribution to the (re)production of value (Barbier et al., 2009; Villa et al., 2009; Fisher et al., 2010; G\u00f3mez-Baggethun et al., 2016) ; for value is the central category of modern capitalist societies, and the valorisation of value -i.e., economic growth sublimated into economic development -their driving force (see, e.g., Mankiw (2016) and Holden et al.

The ESF typology would, then, seem apropos when discussed in the context of the P\u00e1ramo. The growing of coffee, fruits, Andean legumes and tubers embodies provisioning services; the stewardship of Espeletia and oak forests incarnate (hydrological and carbon sequestration) regulating services; and agro-touristic activities, alongside the efforts to preserve the campesino identity, typify cultural services. Every form of appropriating the P\u00e1ramo constitutes a commodity whose nascent market requires but the assistance of VES practitioners to adequately estimate their corresponding prices. Once set, prices will harness the Paramunos' predisposition to rational behaviour, eventually attaining efficiency in the use of nature, for the allocation of property rights is, more or less, irrelevant to market efficiency (Coase, 1960; Farley and Costanza, 2010) . The Paramunos' reasoning abides by the type of instrumental rationality described in Section 2. Their reflective considerations on value are rational, because they coincide with the eminently transactional ideal of VES, where individual preferences are equalised through pricing in a self-fulfilling vision of unity. Rationality is, consequently, established as the confirmation of a preordained social praxis that encourages circulation over production.",

By computational environment we understand a collection of computational techniques that (re)produce dialogical settings where multiple actions on the P\u00e1ramo are, intentionally or otherwise, conflated with the notion of value. These techniques delineate an environ for all interested stakeholders to put forward their views on how the P\u00e1ramo can be construed, and pit these arguments against one another as a means to prioritise over multiple, and often conflicting, management practices. The core of our approach resides in its paraconsistent logical model, in the sense of Section 2, wrapped up in an argumentation framework. Argumentation frameworks are abstract devices that formalise dialogues (Walton, 2009 ). They are composed by a body of arguments, a relation of attack stating which arguments can pose a challenge to some other arguments, and a set of motivational states underpinning the framework's arguments (Prakken, 2018) . The argumentation framework we use is special for at least two reasons: 1) it incorporates information on which and under what conditions the outcome of an argument is preferred over distinct alternatives, and 2) it determines the validity of a given argument through a logical model of entailment. Definition 4.1 provides a formal account of a value-based argumentation framework (VAF). A value-based abstract argumentation framework is a tuple VAF = A, R, V, val, P . A is a set of arguments, R \u2286 A \u00d7 A is a binary relation of attack, V is a non-empty set of values, P is the set of total orders on V , and val : A \u2192 V .",

Distinct from classical games, 2-DDG gives a more robust grounding to the strategic interaction occurring between the two players, to the point that the game can be approached as a dialogue.

The recognition of the fact that the p\u00e1ramo plays an indirect role in the provision of water used in agriculture, while inscribed in the contradiction expounded on A 6 , opens up the possibility of opting out of agriculture as a (dialectic) logical consequence, with objective grounding; rather than a mediated determination or ad-hoc imposition.",

Clauses are either facts or rules to derive new information, in the spirit of PROLOG (Flach, 1994) . Rules have a head an a body composed of facts, while facts only consist of the head. Rules can be read as the head being true if the body of the rule is found true. Rules can be recursive, i.e., they can be processed by solving smaller instances of the statements they declare, after solving their basic case (Flach, 1994) . Clauses indicating motivational states are distinguished from arguments, if they imply a relation of order. This distinction is achieved by calibrating the ELMO model with the contextual information obtained from the transcriptions of informal dialogues with the Paramunos. Multiple encounters were arranged with the locals. We ran one workshop and engaged in less structured interactions with several Paramunos individually, and as members of a communitybased organisation in separate instances. Additional meetings were held with the authorities of the Guanent\u00e1-Alto R\u00edo Fonce wildlife sanctuary within the GLR complex. Although a research protocol was drafted and observed, some of these encounters occurred fortuitously, enabling an immersive involvement rather than an observational experience. The workshop was centered on various notions commonly associated with the idea of value. It was divided into two parts, beginning with a discussion on forest management practices as a means to motivating the construction of a time line depicting the various ways in which the P\u00e1ramo has been appropriated for the past three decades. The second part was devoted to (de)constructing value. It comprised a series of didactic activities revisiting and introducing distinct notions that are, sometimes unknowingly, connected to that of value. Our objective was to prompt a debate on the apparent multiplicity of values, and the existence of a common basis -if any; for if a type of value is recognised as such, there must be a fundamental quality that it shares with other types of values upholding said recognition. The exploration of these ideas would either corroborate, or not, the extent to which the Paramuno sociality could be considered of a value-based nature.",

Figure 8 shows the links among several social actors in the P\u00e1ramo, in accord with the baseline information reported by Rojas et al. (2017) . The edges express a common actor typology, and the size of the nodes reflect their degree of betweenness, with respect to the information on water and agropastoral practices available to each actor. Unsurprisingly, grassroots and community led organisations display larger values of betweennes, for they are well-connected, and in a better position to facilitate the transmission of information. Let us recall that betweenness is a centrality measure informing the number of shortest paths in a network that pass through a particular node (Opsahl et al., 2010) , as an indication of how much information is likely to flow through said node, i.e., how much first-hand information a P\u00e1ramo actor is capable of communicating.",

The evaluation of our results involves estimating the stable state of the (argument-based) GLR network's topology, as described by the dialogical outcomes of grounded DDGs. We do this to foretell the likelihood of long-term changes in the configuration of the existing social relations in the P\u00e1ramo, attributable to the actions suggested by our approach. The graphs in Figure 12 and Figure 13 represent stable configurations of the networks in Figure 8 and Figure 9 , respectively. The new graphs were obtained by minimizing the microcanonical entropy of the different network realisations (see Bianconi (2009) ) enabled by grounded DDG interactions, through an agglomerative MCMC heuristic (Peixoto, 2013) . This means that the entropy induced Figure 13 : Stable Block Configuration of the GLR Network under Grounded DDG by our grounded dialogues is used to estimate the probability of nodes and edges -i.e., P\u00e1ramo actors and their relations -of falling within a particular block partition of the GLR network, by way of a(n) (algorithmically) greedy MCMC sampling of the blocks -i.e., an agglomerative heuristic (Peixoto, 2014) . Figure 8 indicates that the municipalities of Duitama, Paipa, Paz del R\u00edo and Soata, originally, make up the four blocks explaining the socio-economic dynamics of the GLR complex. Duitama and Paz del R\u00edo concentrate most of the actors belonging to the productive and institutional typologies described in Rojas et al. (2017) (see Table 3 (a) and Table 4 (a)). These actors were relatively unconcerned with the grassroots processes occurring on the eastern parts of the complex, in a scenario prior to the official delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo (Rivera-Ospina and Rodr\u00edguez-Murcia, 2011; Rojas et al., 2017) . Figure 13 , shows how that the original network shifts into a six block configuration, once our results are accounted for. Under these new circumstances, some of the actors in Duitama and Paipa loose their importance, judged in terms of block-connectivity, whereas the social actors of municipalities like Encino and Charal\u00e1 -namely, community-based associations and the Natural Parks authority -gain notoriety. It is also worth noting that the municipalities of Charal\u00e1 and G\u00e1mbita establish new bonds across the geographical boundaries of the GLR complex.",

Further to the changes in the spatial connectivity of the Paramunos, evidenced through Figures  12 -13 and Tables 3 -4, we examined the qualitative connections highlighted by our DDG analysis. To this effect we estimated the correlation between the blocks in each configuration, using the information on agropastoral and water management practices reported in Rojas et al.

Let us note in passing, that the ensuing analysis does not necessarily conform to a spatial interpretation, for the various configurations of our networks of agents were obtained by looking at criteria which are not directly dependent on geographical considerations -e.g., block 4 of the grounded network is composed of P\u00e1ramo actors from the Bel\u00e9n, Charal\u00e1, and Encino municipalities (see Table 3 (b)). Figures 14 (a) -(b) show the degree of correlation among the blocks of our baseline and grounded networks, measured as the number of edges (links) generated among the corresponding blocks throughout their MCMC sampling. The former figure indicates that all municipalities -as the blocks of the baseline network can be mapped to municipalities -are correlated to Duitama, although the dependence is not reciprocal. The unilateral connection between Paz del R\u00edo and Duitama -signalled by the yellow box in Figure 14 (a) -can be explained by the functioning of one of the largest steelworks in the former municipality, which created a considerable demand for agricultural produce satisfied via Duitama, also serving as a link for the transportation of steel into Bogot\u00e1 Rojas et al. (2017) . To this day Duitama is still considered one of the main commercial and manufacturing centres of the Boyac\u00e1 province.",

It is as though VES practitioners would set out to solve the problems created by value-based social relations, precisely, by furthering the relations themselves.",
