The available data from the first 14 cases demonstrated that the median age of patients was 71 and the median PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, and lung compliance were 70, 15 cmH 2 O, 21 cmH 2 O, and 28 mL/cmH 2 O, respectively. Median serum KL-6 level was 333 U/mL. Consequently, 16 (62%) out of the 26 have been weaned off and 6 (26%) have been extubated and on rehabilitation, while the other 10 (38%) remain on ECMO. There seemed to be two phenotypes of COVID-19: one with impaired lung compliance and one with preserved lung compliance. The latter phenotype was likely to be favored from the use of ECMO. Further investigation is necessary to clasrify the optimal use of ECMO in patients with COVID-19.",

Selected laboratory data of the patients on admission were as follows: median serum KL-6 (a marker of interstitial pneumonia) was 333 U/mL, LDH was 460 IU/L, and procalcitonin was 0.12 ng/mL. With regard to ECMO settings, the median blood flow was 4 L/min (range 2.5-5.3 L/min), the median size of the draining cannula was 24 Fr (range 21-25 Fr), and the median size of the infusing cannula was 20 Fr (range 16-21 Fr). For anti-viral treatment, lopinavir was used for 13/14 (93%) patients. All patients received empirical antibiotics (carbapenems or 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins). Ciclesonide, a glucocorticoid inhaler, was used for 4/13 (31%) of the cases. The effectiveness of any of the medications cannot be assessed at this time.",
