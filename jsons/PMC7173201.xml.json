Moreover, it would seem that of the 75% who would commit themselves to a beneficial view some 50% were not firmly committed to that view and would examine each case critically on its individual merits. In particular, those aspects of biotechnology which lead to therapeutic capabilities were regarded as highly beneficial, while other developments in the generation of new food products or in the engineering of transgenic animals or plants or in the release of genetically engineered bacteria into the environment as part of a bioremediation program were not deemed to be of universal benefit, and were treated with sceptical caution if not outright antagonism (Kierman, 1996, Marshall, 1996). Other areas where biotechnology might generate products are those in which enhance features of well people (for example the kidney-derived hormone, erythropoietin, will increase the number of red blood cells in patients who repeatedly need kidney dialysis, but this hormone might also be used by athletes (Garewau et al., 1996), or examination candidates or others who might benefit from a higher degree of alertness and sustained activity). Such a use of a product dependent on the new biotechnology (it is made from a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell culture grown in roller bottles manipulated by computer-controlled robots) is either forbidden, unlicensable or illegal.",

A second area where a restructuring of the social components could bring about an improved rate of generating biotechnological benefits based on the use of animal and plant cells in culture is at the interface between industry and the generators of new knowledge and capabilities; viz, the universities and government research establishments (GREs). It must be recognised that much new and important information and technology is generated by industry itself, but in some two-thirds of cases a university or dedicated laboratory was involved in the generation of a discovery of commercial importance in the UK between 1900 and 1990. However, at this time of writing the dogma which is followed is that industry and universities should work more closely together to achieve `realising our potential' (CM2250 Waldegrave, 1993) based on the people engaged in contributing to the intellectual and economic life of the community. This simplistic approach has its drawbacks, yet as it contributes significantly to the configuration of the technology/society interface, I will examine it in more detail.",

Therefore, industrialists do not find it easy to acknowledge the sources of their successes particularly when they come from an extramural origin. An example of this might be that a company having difficulty making a particular vaccine was in receipt of (1) a new, more competent, and productive cell line, (2) a new virus strain and (3) a worked out assay system to monitor virus production. Although it was clear that the company resolved its difficulties, when challenged as to the reasons for its success, it replied that they had used their in-house materials to solve their problems; and when their achievements where challenged publicly it appeared that they had not received any external help whatsoever. However, it was learned many years later that instructions had been given to company employees not to divulge the degree of help they had obtained from the extramural agency.

However, this does not always hold. Most academics have a war-chest of stories as to how they were maltreated by grant reviewers and publication referees (it should be noted that industrialists are not the only malefactors in this context). Yet the insider knowledge which an industrialist might purloin back to the secretive enclave of the industrial base cannot be obviated. Not only are ideas appropriated but projects are discredited and disallowed as they may conflict with industrial ambitions which have not yet been revealed.

If such alterations are allowed then it is difficult to see a difference in principle between these changes and the ones effected by the biotechnologist.

When tomatoes have their shelf-life increased by inserting a gene which codes for an inhibitor of the gene whose expression leads to the production of the enzyme polygalacturonase (an enzyme which accelerates fruit softening and over-ripening) into their genomes, there was much concern expressed in the press and by people. A consensus conference was held on this specific issue in London in 1996 (Lloyd-Evans, 1995) the outcome of which was to affirm that people should be given the opportunity to choose not to have such tomatoes and that the genetically engineered version (the puree and sauce derivatives) should be labelled accordingly (Recent information has it that these products, labelled as being derived from genetically engineered tomatoes, are preferred to the products not so derived). A somewhat different situation is developing in the area of soya beans where an engineered variety of bean has been mixed in with beans which have not come from a genetically engineered plant. The American farmers who produce these beans do not distinguish between them and hold them for storage in hoppers where the beans are mixed. When they began to export such beans to Europe and refused to label the mixture as a commodity which contained genetically engineered material, there was a concern expressed at all political levels. Whether this issue was aggravated by economic considerations and the issue of the mixed beans was used as a device to reduce American imports to Europe is still moot. There is clearly a mixture of ethical issues based on economics, the issues in principle about the edibility of a genetically engineered material (this in spite of the administration by injection of millions of doses of genetically engineered insulin and hepatitis B vaccine) and issues based on labelling practice and the analytical methods which may or may not determine the presence of the genetically engineered material in a sea of non-engineered beans.",

Of course, disaster scernarioists envisage the gene for herbicide resistance being transferred to weeds thus making them resistant and requiring the farmer to use a plant which is resistant to another herbicide so as to continue the `progression'. Although there may be advantages in the decrease of the amount of herbicide used, because of its specificity, the locking-in of the farmer to the seed/herbicide supplier may lead to an exploitation of the farmer with increases in the price of seeds and chemicals. A variant of this situation may be seen in the production of plants by genetic engineering which are resistant to insect attack. Again it is possible that the insects may mutate to become resistant to the toxin which was engineered into the plant thus engendering the re-engineering of the plant with a different insect toxin gene. Clearly in both of these cases there will be changes in the ecosystem. Whether the changes will be beneficial or harmful has to be determined by careful observation and quantification of all the relevant parameters. It is not enough to point out that a change has been made and therefore harm has been committed.

Also, while plant cells enrich human populations via their modification into foods, flowers or pharmaceuticals, animal cells provide a basis for the production of viruses for vaccines and gene vectors for use in the modification of the human genome, and in recent months have been used to initiate clones which has caused the reissue of the concern about the establishment of cloned populations of humans (Spier, 1997, Wilmut et al., 1997). Animal cells in culture are used for a widening range of applications (Editor, 1995). Whereas the initial uses were based on attempts to understand the way the human body differentiated from a fertilised embryo to an adult, in the 1950s animal cells in culture began to be used to produce virus vaccines (polio, followed in the 1960s by mumps, measles and rubella); in which position they stayed until in the 1970s when additional uses were discovered. These included the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies, the production of cytokines and immunoregulators, the generation of therapeutically active enzymes and hormones and, most recently, the making of human organs from cells grown in bioreactors and the use of animal cell cultures to provide the cells used for the cloning of animals (op. cit. Spier (1997)) and possibly humans also (Dickman, 1997) were the legal situation to permit this development (Editor, 1997a, Editor, 1997b, Wadman, 1997a, Wadman, 1997b). As a result of these developments many questions have to be answered as to how we use these potent product materials and, in particular, whether we can only make products aimed at either the therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic markets, but can also make products which will enhance the human condition both in the life time of an individual and also, through the germ-line modifications, the life time of subsequent generations.",

Also, other vaccines whose efficacy would decrease the demand for successful drugs (stomach ulcers and the common cold caused by a mixture of rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and adenoviurses) are not high-priority items for the pharmaceutical companies. Finally, the actual charge levied on the vaccine is a matter of concern for those vaccines which have more than paid off their R&D costs. In some cases a two-tier system is in operation and some vaccines are sold to the WHO or to a government sponsored vaccination program at a fraction of the price that would be charged to a private physician treating an adult patient.",

Furthermore, provisions have to be in place to obtain informed consent (which is not a trivial issue when there are considerable differences in language, culture and basic understandings). There may be additional problems in that the removal of blood samples (necessary to determine the efficacy of the vaccine) may raise taboo issues for a person and may not provide access to another part of his/her essential body parts for fear that they maybe used to damage or harm the tissue donor.",

Thus, in the case of AIDS, it is possible to prevent the spread of this infection by the appropriate use of contraceptive condoms and the abstinence from the practice of unprotected anal penetrative sexual intercourse. Hepatitis A virus transmission has been shown to be markedly decreased when people are willing to wash their hands thoroughly before eating, and hepatitis B transmission responds to the same prohibitions that apply to the AIDS situation. This evokes the question as to the necessity for the raising of vaccines for these diseases. In this determination we have to assess the costs and benefits to society as a whole for each course of action and bear in mind that in a freedom-promoting political environment the inculcation of changed behaviour patterns is difficult if not impracticable. We are, therefore, at this time, left without a choice but to follow the technical route to achieve the control and elimination of disease through the widespread use of effective vaccines; many of which are made in animal cell culture.",

Additionally it is possible to use the genes which code for these hormones as a means of generating transfected animals and humans which permanently secrete larger amounts of the hormone than normal. This may lead to larger animals or cows with increased milk yields or animals which are deliberately rendered sterile. A consequence of effecting such changes is that the economics of particular industries may be affected, with the displacement of groups of farmers (for example) from the workforce. There are also a series of concerns based on the production of unusual animals. However, the latter eventualities may be likened to the selective breeding programmes which have been used for dogs, camels, turkeys or horses, whereby breeds have emerged which are incapable of survival except through the offices of human carers.

The question which falls from these considerations is whether we would wish to produce more people with attributes of higher value as depicted above, or otherwise.

Manipulation of the composition and concentration of these chemicals can be used to improve the immune response to vaccines, infections, cancers and autoimmune diseases, such as the rheumatic disorders.
