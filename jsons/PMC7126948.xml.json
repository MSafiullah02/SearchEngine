Handkerchief use increased during the first 2 days of symptoms and gradually declined during the subsequent two. Handkerchief use was not random throughout the hours of daily activity (p < 0.05). It was most prominent in the morning after awakening, between 8:00 and 11:00 AM, and less so during the afternoon (Table I).

However, the unequal dosing strategy might be more beneficial for the control of the disease than the equal-interval, equal-dose regimen, since it takes into account the circadian rhythmic aspects of allergic rhinitis.",

The rationale for the chronotherapy of corticosteroids is the extensive amount of research demonstrating that the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis is dependent on the circadian timing of synthetic corticosteroid hormones.41, 42, 43 Doses timed during the initial hours of the activity span, which correspond in time to the peak plasma cortisol level, are less adrenal suppressive than are those timed late in the evening or at night when the endogenous hormone level is low. Because supper and bedtime administration of tablet corticosteroids poses an elevated risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical suppression and perhaps other side effects, equal-interval, equal-dose (three to four-times daily) homeostatic treatment regimens are not recommended as a long-term treatment strategy.42, 43 In addition, morning and mid-day corticosteroid tablet administration is more effective in treating nocturnal asthma than is evening administration.32, 42\n",

Assessments were conducted at four different times of day: 7:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 4:30 PM, and 10:30 PM, with the order of treatment timings randomized between subjects. Ipratropium bromide was most effective in reducing airway resistance when it was inhaled in the morning at 7:30 AM. The 80 \u03bcg dose had little impact on airway resistance when given at 10:30 PM; however, a dose of 200 \u03bcg was effective at this time. The effect of ipratropium bromide on dynamic lung compliance was also administration time dependent. It was greatest at 10:30 PM; at all other times of the day 80 \u03bcg of the drug had little or no influence on this pulmonary function measure.

Shiftworkers undergo readjustment of their circadian time structure with each rotation that entails alteration of the sleep-wake pattern. In the majority of studies on rhinorrhea, there was no standardization of the sleep-wake synchronizer schedule of circadian rhythms, nor was there mention of the subjects' sleep-wake routine. In addition, information on medication use was oftentimes lacking or incomplete. Even when it was known that patients received medication to manage allergic rhinitis, the dose and schedule of the medications were not always specified. In spite of these drawbacks in investigative methods, prominent day-night patterns in the symptoms of both viral and allergic rhinitis were detected. In the case of allergic rhinitis, the circadian variability was documented in studies conducted in different counties, in women and men, in the young and elderly, in smokers and nonsmokers, in newly diagnosed and chronic sufferers, and in patients with seasonal and perennial rhinitis.30, 31, 32, 47, 48, 49 In diurnally active individuals, symptoms most commonly started or were most severe during the morning after awakening from nighttime sleep.",

Unfortunately, specific symptoms were not self-assessed repeatedly during the 24 hours; thus determination of the magnitude of the temporal variation could not be accomplished. Nonetheless, prominent day-night variation in the manifestation of the infectious disease was detected. In patients with mild to moderate symptoms of cold or influenza, handkerchief use was respectively one and one half to fourfold greater during the morning hours between 8:00 and 11:00 AM than during the afternoon. The effect of influenza on mental alertness and sublingual temperature was also time dependent. The decrement in alertness and increment in temperature were most pronounced in the morning.

Reinberg et al.32 used a repeat-measures, self-assessment protocol to ascertain the occurrence and intensity of symptoms four times daily. They found that the magnitude of the 24-hour variation in the intensity of sneezing, nasal congestion, and nasal drainage was around 20% on average. However, because data collection was restricted to the hours of daytime activity only, the estimate of the extent of the variability in symptom intensity may be conservative. Patients oftentimes complain that their sleep is disturbed because of severe nasal congestion causing difficulty in breathing overnight. Thus the time when the nasal congestion of allergic and perhaps infectious rhinorrhea is most severe may be somewhat earlier than determined by surveys restricted to the daytime hours only. Close review of the published reports on allergic rhinitis reveal a second time, between supper and bedtime, when symptom intensity is elevated.31, 32, 49 The limited data published thus far on viral rhinorrhea reveal only a single morning time peak in symptoms during the 24 hours. The second peak of symptoms experienced by some sufferers of allergic rhinitis might represent a late-type reaction to antigens.50 Such reactions have also been reported for allergic asthma and dermatitis.51, 52\n",

Others cite the role of the prone position during sleep as contributing to the worsening of nasal congestion overnight. The severity of morning symptoms of allergic rhinitis is commonly blamed on antigen exposure, particularly house dust mite, mold, and feathers, in the bedroom during nocturnal sleep. All such explanations are incomplete; they focus exclusively on temporal changes in the external environment without consideration of possible contributions of the circadian time structure.",

            "text": "The symptoms of rhinorrhea, regardless of origin, result from tissue injury caused by immunologic reactions and chemical mediator release associated with inflammation of the upper airways. The processes underlying the pathophysiology of inflammation are modulated by certain circadian rhythmic processes.53 The symptoms of other inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, are worse during nocturnal sleep or in the morning on awakening. Laboratory rodent research reveals the rate and extent of the edematous response to phlogistic agents, the mucopolysaccharide carrageenan,54, 55 the antibiotic polymycin B, and croton oil,56 vary by up to threefold according to the circadian time of their administration. Time-dependent differences in the inflammatory response may be related to the circadian rhythm in cortisol.54 Experimentally induced edema is greatest when plasma cortisol level is lowest (during the rest span) and least when cortisol is highest (during the activity span); adrenalectomy results in loss of circadian rhythmicity in the edematous response. Rhythms in the bradykinin, prostaglandin E2, arachidonic acid, tissue blood flow, and the number and functional capacity of macrophages plus other inflammatory cells are thought to be involved.23, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 Circadian rhythms in plasma cortisol and the autonomic nervous system plus day-night differences in airways inflammation, reactivity, and clearance may also play a role because they are known to contribute to the worsening of lung function and asthma overnight.13, 20\n",

Generally, this type of medication is used two to four times daily at equal intervals and equal doses to maintain tissue drug levels at near constant levels. Several published studies confirm the expectation that topical corticosteroids, in comparison with antihistamines alone, achieve a greater level of symptom relief. Moreover, the findings of two clinical trials involving topical corticosteroids imply that both the morning and afternoon peaks in symptom intensity or occurrence observed in some patients can be moderated by equal-interval, equal-dose treatment regimens.48, 49 The advantage of a chronotherapy for aerosol corticosteroids for allergic rhinitis has yet to be explored. Initial chronotherapeutic trials on asthma patients with corticosteroid aerosols show that the therapeutic efficiency varies with time of administration; high-dose inhalation corticotherapy timed to the middle of the patient's activity span (about 8 hours after awakening from nighttime sleep) results in a greater improvement in pulmonary function as measured by spirometry than does morning or evening once-a-day administration.45\n",
