Based on Tripet\u2019s finding [29], we selected N35 and C35 to construct HR121 (N35-C35-N35) and HR212 (C35-N35-C35). HR121 consisted of two N35 segments and one C35 segment alternatively linked with the short peptide sequences, while HR212 consisted of two C35 segments and one N35 segment (Fig. 1B). The genes encoding the two proteins were then subcloned into E. coli expression vector pGEX-6P-1 by two restriction enzyme sites of EcoRI and XhoI. A stop codon was introduced before the XhoI site. This cloning strategy yielded glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and the fusion proteins were named after GST-HR121 and GST-HR212, respectively. N108, N44, and C38 were subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI site of pET-30a and yielded the proteins with N-terminal 6\u00d7 his-tag, thrombin, and enterokinase cleavage sites.

Single colony from the respective transformation was grown at 37 \u00b0C in 2\u00d7 YT to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of 0.8\u20131.0 and then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG at 20 \u00b0C for 4 h.

The fractions of the peak were collected and run on 12% SDS\u2013PAGE. The peak molecular weight was estimated by comparison with the protein standards (Pharmacia) running on the same column. The clarified supernatants of N108, N44, and C38 were applied on Ni-chelated Sepharose affinity column (Pharmacia).

The structure forms a thermostable trimer of hairpins in which HR1 and HR2 are entirely helical and arranged in a six-helix bundle. We have made use of the 2-helix core as a scaffold to link another HR1 to its C terminus and another HR2 to its N terminus, respectively (Fig. 1C). The rational for this design is that three HR1s or HR2s will be stabilized as a consequence of it being covalently linked to the S2 ectodomain core by a flexible linker.

The elution peaks of both HR121 and HR212 proteins were just after the peak position corresponding to 52 kDa, while the calculated molecular weights of HR121 and HR212 were 12.4 and 12.6 kDa, respectively, which indicates that both HR121 and HR212 could form oligomers, probably trimers (Figs. 3\nA and B). Subsequently, chemical cross-linking demonstrated that HR121 and HR212 could indeed form trimer (Figs. 3C and D), although the monomer/dimer bands did not completely disappear even in high concentrations of the cross-linker. However, the density of the trimer band tended to get thicker with the gradual increase of the cross-linker concentrations. The molecular weight of the cross-linked trimer was around 38 kDa, close to the theoretical value. These gave strong evidence that both HR121 and HR212 could still assemble into six-helix bundle structures in PBS similar to that formed by 2-helix. However, the six-helix bundles formed by HR121 or HR212 also had three superfluous HR1s or HR2s, which were different from that formed by 2-helix.",

It was proposed that formation of the bundles (Fig. 1C) was irreversible under physiological conditions. HR121 could reverse at physiological conditions to expose its HR2 segment. The exposed HR2 bound to viral HR1 region and prevented the formation of S2 six-helix bundle, thereby blocking fusion by the same mechanism as that of individual HR2 peptides [21].",

In the absence of inhibitors, this transient state ultimately collapsed into a six-helix bundle that brought the HR1 and HR2 regions into close proximity, promoting membrane fusion. The entry inhibitors (black cylinder) targeting HR1 regions prevented the formation of the six-helix bundle.
