This article contributes to a new application of social impact in social media (SISM) methodology. This study focuses on the social impact of the research to identify what type of health information is false and what type of information is evidence of the social impact shared in social media. The analysis of social media includes Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. This analysis contributes to identifying how interactions in these forms of social media depend on the type of information shared. The results indicate that messages focused on fake health information are mostly aggressive, those based on evidence of social impact are respectful and transformative, and finally, deliberation contexts promoted in social media overcome false information about health. These results contribute to advancing knowledge in overcoming fake health-related news shared in social media.",

The impact of fake news in social media is a major concern in public health, as it can reduce or increase the effectiveness of programs, campaigns and initiatives aimed at citizens' health, awareness and well-being. The advancements in the methodologies related to social media analysis provide new insights to unveil how citizens share health information and the ways in which fake news influences public health. Social impact in social media (SISM) constitutes a novel methodology in both social media analytics and the evaluation of the social impact of research [2] . This article applies the SISM methodology to the specific case of fake news in health to identify the type of interactions related to the information shared in social media.",

The WHO warned in February 2020 that the COVID-19 outbreak had been accompanied by a massive 'infodemic', or an overabundance of information-some of which was accurate and some of which was not-which made it difficult for people to find reliable sources and trustworthy information when they needed it [3] . The consequences of disinformation overload are the spread of uncertainty, fear, anxiety and racism on a scale not seen in previous epidemics, such as SARS, MERS and Zika. Therefore, the WHO is dedicating tremendous efforts aimed at providing evidence-based information and advice to the population through its social media channels, such as Weibo, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Pinterest, as well as through its website. The MIT Technology Review highlights that social media are not only being used to spread false news and hate messages but are also being used to share important truthful data and solidarity with all those affected by the virus and hate messages [4] .",

On the one hand, the combination of artificial intelligence and big data can help public health providers identify pandemic diseases in real time, improving the coordination of the response of public health systems through information sharing and improving surveillance and diagnostics. Furthermore, research shows that social media information and social media responses are effective strategies to gain feedback on potential public health policy proposals. This positive impact of social media in health has been demonstrated in a recent study about heat protection policy for Australian schools, which, through the analysis of public comments posted on a national Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) website, identifies the themes to support a national heat protection policy for schools [8] .",

Globalization also plays a crucial role in the spread of health news, including social media, influencing the way users receive such news [16, 17] . In this arena, it is important to highlight that in a globalized world, health content information can be perceived differently depending on the target group or context [18] . Therefore, fake news may reach citizens in different ways, depending on their age, culture, and other factors [19] . Moreover, research shows that social media and related global digital media content influence discourses about professions and how citizens perceive them, including public health professionals [20] . For instance, many public health programs aimed at children and youth have physical education at the core of their initiatives [21, 22] . The teaching profession is often portrayed in digital media in relation to unhelpful physical crisis messages [23] or discourses related to bullying in movie scenes. In a similar vein, social media has also been demonstrated to influence the perceptions of adolescent students with regard to their sexual and reproductive health learning [24] . As a result, health professionals may recognize that social media channels, such as Facebook, offer possibilities to support their activities.",

The influence of social media discourses may differ depending on age, culture or gender [19] . For example, young people build their identities, construct knowledge and acquire information from digital media, including social media, beyond formal education and classroom learning, which is an approach resonating with \"public pedagogies\" [25] . Other authors such as Ulmer [26] argue that mass digital media provides the public an 'entry point' into the debates. The fact is that digital and social media contribute to the strength or undermine the diversity of points of view, influencing the development of specific health public health policies and interventions [27, 28] . Such influence of the media has been defined by some authors as the \"fourth state\" [29] . Taking into account these contextual considerations, it is important to face fake news related to health in social media to support public health policies instead of trying to reverse them.",

Furthermore, in these cases, they are less likely to have a pre-existing opinion about health information than are those who share fake news stories about other topics [34] .

The second profile, called 'sophisticated bots', is artificial intelligence that automatically spreads content via Twitter with the same objective of making people believe that the medical community is divided.

These techniques include both human intervention and algorithms to verify the veracity of information across technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) [44] . Other mechanisms developed as a remedy against fake news on social media are source ratings that can be applied to articles when they are initially published, such as expert ratings (in which expert reviewers fact check articles-the results of which are aggregated to provide a source rating), user article ratings (in which users rate articles-the results of which are aggregated to provide a source rating), and user source ratings (in which users rate the sources themselves) [34] .",

The main research questions are as follows: RQ1) How are social media messages focused on fake health information or misinformation?; RQ2) How are social media messages focused on health evidence with potential or real social impacts?; and RQ3) How do interactions based on health evidence with potential or real social impacts help overcome misinformation or fake health information? The results indicate that messages focused on fake health information are mostly aggressive, those based on evidence of social impact are respectful and transformative, and finally, deliberation contexts promoted in social media overcome false health-related information.",

First, we have detected hostility to arguments based on science and even defamation of scientists who have contributed to advances in the field of vaccines. One of the examples of fake news in vaccines said the following: \"Vaccines have a long history of damaging the brain from day one\", followed by \"The-so-called Father of Vaccination left his first son brain-damaged by vaccinating him, Jenner was smart enough not to vaccinate his second\". This is an example false of information that has negative impacts on the truth. First, Jenner devoted his life to overcoming smallpox. Jenner even freely treated poor people to save them from smallpox. His discovery had a substantial social impact, and his sons died due to tuberculosis, not due to smallpox vaccines. This scientific article explains in detail the contribution of Edward Jenner [49] and concludes how his discovery and the promotion of vaccination facilitated the eradication of smallpox.

For instance, one of the examples begins with \"I would be interested in a healthy and respectful conversation\", saying that he is a \"vaccine agnostic\", sharing his opinion that he believes there are more risks than benefits. However, he is open to dialogue. This message is based on opinion, not scientific evidence. However, he is honest, saying that it is an opinion, and he is not assuming that he knows the truth; this is a first step towards dialogue. This case reflects another type of message found, people who are influenced by false information but open to having a conversation. Nevertheless, this opinion also has negative consequences, as he stated that his children are not vaccinated and, thus, they are also at risk.",

This person received replies with evidence of social impact focused on comparative studies between people who were vaccinated and not vaccinated, where those who were vaccinated exhibited better health than those who were not. Direct links to these studies were also provided. Some of the information detailed the following, \"German study on lower rates of asthma among the vaccinated\", \"comparing unvaccinated and vaccinated people who do catch the flu-vaccinated people are protected from the most serious effects, vaccinated versus unvaccinated children: how they fare in first five years of life, Nigerian study of 25 unvaccinated and 25 vaccinated children: one vaccinated child had a mild case of measles.

In this case, vaccines were used. One of the conversations selected was concern around Andy Wakefield and his research-that is, an ex-physician who became an anti-vaccine activist, among those responsible for purporting a link between vaccines and autism. The clear and overwhelming consensus among scientists is that \"His malevolent influence on the vaccine world was terrible, and we have still not fully recovered even though his publications and ethics have been debunked. Because of his paper, millions of people were not vaccinated, and thousands have died. What a legacy to live with\". Furthermore, the final example selected was regarding the negative impact of a community that opts to remain vaccinated. This dialogue was started by someone sharing the concept of \"herd immunity\". This concept details that in a community, there are people who cannot be vaccinated, such as due to allergies or those who are immunocompromised, and they depend on herd immunity to protect them. This was followed by highlighting that \"If too many people who could get the vaccine but choose not to, it does not just affect the individual but can compromise others in the community as well\". This person explained that in his/her county, a large population chose not to vaccinate and, consequently, there was a measles outbreak; further, an emergency was declared. He/she has a friend who is immunocompromised and needed to stay home for fear of contracting the measles, \"it was terrifying and preventable if people who could get the vaccine would choose to do so. It is a choice that does have an impact on others\". This conversation opens a dialogue on how our decisions based on false information can have a negative impact on the health of others. Thus, it is crucial to apply the evidence of social impact in collective matters to guarantee, in this case, successful public health.",

Our study contributes to advances in the direction of overcoming false information in health through the analysis of how the messages and interactions are based on false health-related information and the transformative dimension of those messages based on evidence of social impact. This identification has made it possible to apply the SISM methodology, which is focused on evidence of social impact.

Moreover, the percentage of tweets and Facebook posts providing information about potential or actual social impacts in relation to the total amount of social media data (SICOR) is higher in Tweets and subreddit comments than in Facebook posts and comments. Another relevant finding is that messages focused on false information regarding health are mostly aggressive, and messages based on evidence of social impact are respectful and transformative.
