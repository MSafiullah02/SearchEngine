            "text": "Generally, studies on enteric disease have focused on a specific pathogen (Reed et al., 1986, Fellstr\u00f6m et al., 1996). Several agents have been suggested as possible causes of diarrhoea in growing pigs, namely Brachyspira spp. (Taylor et al., 1980), Campylobacter spp. (Lawson and McOrist, 1993), Clostridium perfringens type A (Jestin et al., 1985), enterotoxic strains of Escherichia coli (Svensmark et al., 1989), Lawsonia intracellularis (McOrist et al., 1995), Salmonella spp. (Reed et al., 1986), Yersinia spp. (Taylor, 1999), coronavirus (Pritchard, 1987), rotavirus (Lecce et al., 1982), Isospora suis (Nilsson, 1988) and Trichuris suis (Batte et al., 1977). However, the importance and involvement of some of these organisms in clinical disease still remains to be clarified. It is often possible to relate a certain microbe to characteristic pathological lesions in the gut. For instance, the lesions caused by L. intracellularis are mainly located in the small intestines (McOrist et al., 1995), while lesions due to Brachyspira spp. are observed in the large intestines (Moxley and Duhamel, 1999; Taylor et al., 1980). B. hyodysenteriae causes necrosis in the intestinal mucosa, with mucohaemorrhagic exudate (Wilcock and Olander, 1979), whereas B. pilosicoli causes less prominent changes, with oedema and the development of a false brush border (Trott et al., 1996a). Few surveys have been conducted on the relationship between clinical disease and various pathogens (Johnston et al., 2001; M\u00f6ller et al., 1998) or pathological lesions in the intestines (Jensen, 1995; Thomson et al., 1998).",

Except for L. intracellularis, the microbiological findings were similar in the diarrhoeic and apparently healthy pigs from the poor performance herds. Demonstration of B. pilosicoli and L. intracellularis was significantly correlated to poor performance herds and compatible with the pathological lesions in the intestines (Lomax and Glocke, 1982; Trott et al., 1996b). This is in agreement with earlier studies showing that L. intracellularis and B. pilosicoli are the most commonly found pathogens in growing pigs (M\u00f6ller et al., 1998; Thomson et al., 1998). These authors also report a frequent finding of concomitant infections with two or more pathogens, which is in conformity with our results. However, in the present study a concomitant infection with B. pilosicoli and L. intracellularis was found only in the case pigs. Thus, the risk of developing clinical disease might increase if both pathogens are present, since the damage in the intestines will probably be more extended. The extent of intestinal damage seems to be closely related to the clinical symptoms, since 78% of the case pigs but only 18% of the \u201cpoor controls\u201d had gross lesions, despite the fact that most pigs had microscopic lesions in the intestines (Table 2).",

C. coli is often found in pigs irrespective of their clinical health status and is considered non-pathogenic to pigs (Lawson and McOrist, 1993). C. jejuni, Cl. perfringens type A, Y. enterocolitica, B. pilosicoli, L. intracellularis and/or pathogenic E. coli were identified in 49 of the 54 pigs from the poor performance herds. Except for B. pilosicoli and L. intracellularis, no correlation was found between the findings of these bacteria and the clinical symptoms. However, only one case of pathogenic E. coli and two cases of Cl. perfringens were found in the conventionally reared, good performance herds. It is possible that feed compounds, inadequate biosecurity, hygienic or other factors in a herd may facilitate the transmission, survival and growth of some enteropathogenic bacteria (Bertschinger et al., 1978,1979; Skjerve et al., 1998; Wathes et al., 1989). The increased number of potentially pathogenic species results in an increased risk of clinical enteric disease (L\u00f6fstedt et al., 2000). Thus, one or several risk factors may be present in the poor performance herds. Alternatively, the enteric diseases per se may alter the ecological balance of the gut flora or change the environmental conditions in the gut, which would favour some bacteria (Katouli et al., 1999; K\u00fchn et al., 1995). Pathogenic strains of E. coli was found in four out of six samples from two of the poor performance herds. Both these herds had a case history of previous problems with post-weaning diarrhoea. As discussed above, this might indicate that these herds suffer from a high pathogen load, or that the post-weaning diarrhoea might predispose to outbreaks of other enteric diseases.",

Additionally, the presence of some of the microorganisms discussed above might serve as an indication of a disturbance. The applicability of these methods needs to be further evaluated. Measurement of the phenotypic diversity of the coliform flora is a useful marker in studies of post-weaning diarrhoea (Katouli et al., 1999; Melin et al., 2000). However, the results of the present study indicate that the coliform flora remains stable during the course of diarrhoea in growing pigs.",

            "text": "The results suggest that a high prevalence of enteric diseases in a herd might involve an increasing number of potential food pathogens in the gut. It might be suspected that if an animal harbours a large number of these bacteria at slaughter, the risk of contamination of the carcass will increase (Asplund et al., 1998; Nesbakken and Skjerve, 1996). However, our study has focused on enteric diseases in grower pigs and it is not known whether our findings will be applicable to finisher/slaughter pigs. In a Norwegian study, the prevalence of Y. enterocolitica in slaughter pigs differed between herds with different production systems (Skjerve et al., 1998). Interestingly, in the present study two case pigs and one control pig from the same herd showed an abundant growth of Y. enterocolitica.",

Salmonella spp. and Y. pseudotuberculosis were not found in this study, but have been reported as a cause of colitis from other studies (Thomson et al., 1998). The results confirm the very low prevalence of Salmonella in Swedish pig herds reported previously (Wahlstr\u00f6m et al., 1998; Wahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2000).
