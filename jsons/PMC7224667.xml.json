Previous reports have identified alterations in the renin-angiotensin system activity profile of blacks.4 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 enters human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and angiotensin II activity potentially contributes to disease severity and organ damage.5 Owing to the small sample size of this case series, no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding COVID-19 susceptibility in black males with OHT. As such, further research is needed to determine if disease severity and COVID-19 risk is greater in black males with OHT and whether patient characteristics or treatments specific to OHT can be modified to decrease this risk.",
