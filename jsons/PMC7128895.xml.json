On the World Health Organisations (WHO) top 10 threats to global health in 2019, four on the list directly refer to infectious diseases: pandemic influenza, HIV, dengue and another for high-threat pathogens such as Ebola (World Health Organisation, 2019). Emerging infectious diseases caused by novel pathogenic organisms are of notable concern, it was highlighted by WHO that since the 1970s, over 1500 new pathogens were discovered and nearly 40 new infectious diseases have been identified (World Health Organisation, 2018a). Many of these have severely impacted communities, with several major outbreaks occurring within the last 20 years including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2002\u20132003), Ebola (2014\u20132016), H1N1flu (swine flu) (2009\u20132010), Zika virus (2015\u20132016) and COVID-19 (2019\u20132020) (World Health Organisation, 2020a). Two others on this list are regarding the prevention and treatment of infectious disease, one being hesitation to vaccinate and the other the rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), both have been linked to the re-emergence of communicable diseases.",

With regards to international flights it has been highlighted that the incubation period of any human disease is still longer than the lengthiest aviation time for any international flight (Frenk and G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s, 2002).

Whilst microbial evolution happens naturally, inappropriate usage of antimicrobials puts additional selective pressures and further facilitates rates of resistance (Allen et al., 2010, Andersson and Hughes, 2014). Whilst antibiotics tends to be focused on in discussions of AMR, rising cases of both fungal and viral resistances still pose significant threats (Fisher et al., 2018). For example, Candida auris, an emerging multidrug resistant yeast, is a cause of major hospital acquired infection with high associated mortality, having only first been identified in 2009 it has resistance to all clinically available antifungals (Lockhart et al., 2017).",

Whilst the recent report (2017\u20132018) has revealed detailed results with participation from over 60 countries, several limitations in the study were discussed (World Health Organisation, 2018b). It was recognised that there was a lack of sampling strategy leading to selection bias, also patient samples are typically taken from those that have sought out medical care and hence might not be representative for a population. It was further highlighted the need to move away from laboratory data to include epidemiological and population data.",

Disease monitoring (which is often disease specific), can vary significantly with country and will depend upon the resources and sophistication of the public health services and facilities available (Thacker et al., 2006). The information collected can be provided to WHO, who have the authority to lead the global surveillance of infectious diseases. WHO have had an integral role in infectious disease surveillance, as well as leading international surveillance networks, e.g. influenza surveillance. They also provide international coordination of epidemic responses in diseases that pose significant public health risks. Examples of conventional routes to monitoring diseases are based upon existing resources, such as mortality and morbidity rates, prescription and hospital admission data. Whilst these are valuable source of information for surveillance purposes, they do suffer from bias, resource insensitivity and costs (Bauer, 2008).",

The 2009 swine flu epidemic caused by a H1N1 influenza virus spread rapidly to>214 countries in the space of a few months. Whilst it was estimated that several million people were infected with over 18,400 confirmed laboratory deaths worldwide reported by August 2010 (World Health Organisation, 2010), it is believed that this is a gross underestimation. Reported studies in the literature have estimated through modelling techniques that there could have been as many as 10\u201315 times this amount, with up to 203,000 respiratory deaths (Dawood et al., 2012, Simonsen et al., 2013).

Furthermore, the surveillance system needs to have comprehensive data collection systems regarding emergence of new diseases and re-emergence of old diseases, the threat of imported diseases or pathogens, and the emergence of multidrug or pan-drug resistant organisms. It has also been highlighted in the literature that monitoring clinics and laboratories for informing on public health is not sufficient, and there should also be an aspect of environmental monitoring of potential hazards (Nsubuga et al., 2006). Therefore, a surveillance technique that could also encompass environmental exposure would be invaluable in providing comprehensive exposure status and disease outcomes.

Whilst conceptually WBE is very simple and clearly offers attractive advantages for the monitoring of public health, there are some challenges to be considered. For example, not only are the levels of biomarkers far more dilute in wastewater, especially in comparison to urine, but the wastewater matrix itself provides a complex environment to work in (Daughton, 2012). As previously mentioned, wastewater contains a diverse abundance of chemical and biological targets which can give incredibly detailed information about the population that contributes. However, a drawback to having such a large amount of information is in the successful extraction from the matrix itself and the subsequent analysis of specific targets can be difficult. Extraction methods such as solid phase extraction and immunoassay techniques along with sophisticated analytical tools such as advanced mass spectrometry have allowed for the analysis of a wide number of compounds (Petrie et al., 2014). Recent developments in sensing approaches could enable measurements on site, which would allow the system to provide information on public health in real time (Yang et al., 2017, Yang et al., 2016, Yang et al., 2015).",

Another challenge associated with WBE is the problem posed by dynamic populations (e.g. population fluctuations due to tourism and commuters) (Ort et al., 2014). Typically the standard approach is for levels of certain endogenous biomarkers in humans, such as cortisol or cotinine, to be calculated as daily loads which have been normalised to the population. This enables inter-city comparison (Chen et al., 2014). However, there are difficulties in estimating the population size of individual WWTP catchments. This can result in unaccounted for, unique population fluctuations that, whilst having negligible impact on the levels of biomarkers in large populations (>100,000 people), they might contribute to higher uncertainties in smaller populations.",

Investigating certain hydrochemical parameters which have well-established methods of analysis, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) or ammonium (NH4\n+) can aid in estimating populations contributing to a WWTP catchment at a particular time period (Been et al., 2014, van Nuijs et al., 2011). These however can be influenced by the composition of wastewater. The other uncertainties associated with the technique briefly mentioned above with regards to sample collection and analytical variability amongst a couple of others, have all been extensively discussed in a number of reviews (Castiglioni et al., 2013, Ort et al., 2014, Ort et al., 2010). However, SCORE and the EMDCCA have demonstrated that with recognition of the limitations of the technique, that the development and adoption of a reliable, standardised method will give reliability and credibility to the studies and allow spatial and temporal comparisons to be made.",

Along with some of the limitations of WBE touched upon above, there are also certain criteria that must be fulfilled for a biomarker to be considered in WBE techniques. For example, the biomarker in question must mostly be excreted via urine and concentrations of the biomarker must be in ng L-1 for downstream detection of the biomarker in wastewater (Chen et al., 2014). Another vital characteristic is that the biomarker needs to be stable, not only in the sewage system but also during the process of sampling and storage (McCall et al., 2016). Biomarkers also need to be unique to human metabolism and ideally the metabolism process involving the biomarker would be well understood. This ensures that the biomarker in question has only originated from human sources, as opposed to exogenous ones (potential contamination of animals in the sewage system or from microbes present in wastewater) (Daughton, 2012). With regards to the sewage system, wastewater is home to an extensive range of complex microbial communities that are challenging to characterise and will vary geographically. As of such, there is a high risk of microbial degradation or transformation of chemical compounds. In fact, biological treatment in wastewater treatment plants, such as trickle bed filters, are home to these diverse microbial communities which play a key role for the breakdown of many organic compounds (Kraigher et al., 2008).",

The detection in influent wastewater would suggest human sources and hence indicate what diseases are circulating within a population. Whilst risk factors for emerging infectious diseases have highlighted resistant bacteria as a concern, viruses pose a significant threat due to their high mutation rates and ability to adapt to new host, e.g. humans. This is particularly in the case of RNA viruses, where higher nucleotide substitution rates can result in this rapid adaption and spreading in new host populations (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). The potential of wastewater to be used for viral surveillance has been well discussed in the literature (Barras, 2018, O\u2019Brien and Xagoraraki, 2019, Wigginton et al., 2015). Wastewater surveillance has already demonstrated promising results with the potential for retrospective prediction of disease outbreaks of hepatitis A and norovirus (Hellm\u00e9r et al., 2014). Influenza in wastewater was also investigated during the H1N1 (swine) flu virus outbreak, whilst influenza A viruses were detected in sewage, the pandemic H1N1 virus was not detected (Heijnen and Medema, 2011). Furthermore, environmental surveillance of polio in wastewater has been utilised since the 1980 s, years before when the term \u201cwastewater-based epidemiology\u201d was coined, with Finland (Hovi et al., 2012) Israel (Roberts, 2013) and Senegal (Ndiaye et al., 2014) all successfully analysing sewage samples in order to assess polio circulating within populations. WHO have also released guidelines for employing environmental sampling to monitor polio in wastewater samples (World Health Organisation, 2003).",

Composition of wastewater contains a diverse range of PCR inhibitors including fats, proteins and humic and fulvic acids, which can cause problems later during downstream processing during PCR. The availability of different commercial extraction kits for DNA/RNA has demonstrated sometimes variable efficiencies and consistencies when extracting from PCR inhibitor rich samples, including wastewater and sediments (Mumy and Findlay, 2004, Walden et al., 2017). This results in challenges when making meaningful comparisons across different studies and in establishing spatial and temporal trends. However, advancements of molecular biology techniques offer new routes for the analysis of genetic material, including digital PCR (dPCR) and next generation sequencing techniques. In dPCR, the absolute quantification of target genes is calculated using Poisson distribution statistics via the partitioning of DNA/RNA samples into tens and thousands of reaction wells. Due to this partitioning effect, PCR inhibitory substances have demonstrated to have less of an effect in environmental samples, including wastewater, when analysed via dPCR (Ra\u010dki et al., 2014). Critical evaluation of dPCR and its suitability for certain sample types have been discussed by Salipante et al (Salipante and Jerome, 2020).",

Some which could be sensitive to changes in the body and could be early indicators of disease. Whilst only a handful of proteins are currently utilised in clinics, it has been previously highlighted that this is not a limitation for WBE, as purposes here are not for diagnostic analysis (Daughton, 2018). Urinary inflammation biomarkers that are indicative of inflammation include C-reactive proteins (CRP) and interleukins including IL-6 and IL-8, have been highlighted as promising candidates for use in WBE (Rice and Kasprzyk-Hordern, 2019). Urinary CRP levels are routinely utilised in clinics and in human biomonitoring studies, e.g. to investigate renal function abnormalities within a population (Stuveling et al., 2003).

As previously mentioned WBE has been successful at monitoring drug usage, and as many infectious diseases are seasonal, there are potentially interesting opportunities for trends to be established in wastewater. Regarding antibiotics, a handful of studies have demonstrated seasonal patterns for several antibiotics, including clarithromycin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin with higher loads typically observed over winter (Coutu et al., 2013, Golovko et al., 2014). This is in line with the use of these antibiotics for respiratory infections where cases tend to peak in winter-early spring. In areas where prescription data is not widely available or antimicrobial medications can be bought over the counter with ease, WBE could provide a route for monitoring antimicrobial usage within a community which otherwise might go unobserved.",

Investigating ratios of parent compounds to respective metabolites or ratios between compound enantiomers in wastewater can inform on whether levels have originated from human excretion or from direct disposal of a pharmaceutical into the sewage system (Petrie et al., 2016). Furthermore the availability of pharmacokinetics data and excretion rates can allow back calculation to the estimated amounts of a pharmaceutical that a population has ingested (Zuccato et al., 2008). This ability to distinguish between prescribed, disposed and consumed is important as just because a pharmaceutical is prescribed does not necessarily mean it is used. Delayed prescribing is a strategy by which a general practitioner (GP) will make a prescription available but will ask the patient to delay from using in order to see if symptoms improve first. The initiative has been evidenced to successfully reduce antibiotic usage in a handful of countries, including New Zealand, Norway and England (Spurling et al., 2013). The use of WBE could therefore give valuable insight into the amounts of antimicrobials a population has actually consumed. However, whilst the analysis of parent compounds to metabolites provides valuable community usage data, the analysis of antibiotic metabolites tends to be overlooked in wastewater analysis, with parent antibiotics typically focused on.",

For example, it has been highlighted the guts of wildfowl could be potential oseltamivir carboxylate-resistance hotspots due to exposure to the metabolite in surface waters (Singer et al., 2007). The rapid spreading of the H1N1 virus and the ease of which viruses can become resistant to antivirals stress the importance of population-wide surveillance tools and again the importance of combining chemical analysis with biological.

The results from clinics are often from a very small proportion of the population who are ill and hence not representative of the population as a whole, as many people can be carriers of a disease or a resistance gene and not experience symptoms (asymptomatic in case of diseases).

Only a handful of studies to date have investigated relationships between the levels of antibiotics and abundance of ARGs in wastewater streams, Correlations observed between antibiotic and respective resistance gene levels have been antibiotic dependant with some correlations observed (Gao et al., 2012, Novo et al., 2013, Rodriguez-Mozaz et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2015). However, it is generally recognised that the relationship between antibiotic concentrations and resistance in wastewater is complex with further studies needed.

Stigmatism surrounding individuals infected with Ebola combined with a sense of distrust in health services and treatment centres resulted in efforts to hide cases.

            "text": "It is widely acknowledged that effective surveillance systems are key for the rapid intervention and control of infectious disease outbreaks. There is also a requirement for population-wide surveillance information to compliment current clinical data. WBE has demonstrated significant promise in providing information on community-wide exposure and health status comprehensively and in near real-time. The importance of effective surveillance has been highlighted recently with the case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). On the 31st December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan City in China. Just a week later on the 7th January Chinese officials had reported a novel strain of the coronavirus (World Health Organisation, 2020b). Even with early intervention measures of quarantining cities in China and travel bans, by the 3rd March 2020 the number of confirmed cases were 90,892 across 73 countries with severe outbreaks occurring in South Korea, Iran and Italy (World Health Organisation, 2020c). Along with the current routes of global surveillance for the virus, WBE, if implemented, could track spread of the virus and, if linked with effective response system, could help with management. However, in order to successfully apply WBE in infectious disease surveillance, rapid advancements are required to tackle some of key challenges. These include:-complexity of wastewater matrix and the need for new biomarker extraction techniques,-difficulties in accurate estimation of population size to account for temporal population size fluctuations,-non-existent biomarker discovery pipeline for both chemical and biological markers-lack of analytical tools for cost-effective, sensitive, selective and multi-residue analysis of wide-ranging biomarker groups spanning from genes through to proteins and whole microorganisms.\n",
