            "text": "Asthma is a serious and complex disease involving broncho constriction, airway inflammation, hyper-responsiveness, and remodeling, all of which can lead to pulmonary dysfunction and even death [1]. The onset of asthma symptoms at less than 5 years of age occurs 80% of the time [2]. Children aged 0\u20134 years have the largest increase in prevalence and greater health care use [3]. Asthma resulted in more than US$5.3 billion in indirect costs, $1.1 billion in lost school days, $1.5 billion in lost workdays, $840 million in caregiver/housekeeping costs, and $1.8 billion in mortality costs in the US in 1998 [4]. Both of industrialized and developing countries have spent lots of money and worked hard on studying asthma to lower the financial costs incurred by the entire society.",

One method of assessing the productivity of scientific researchers is to evaluate their output. To a certain extent, the number of research papers reflects the activity and academic level of a scientist. Also, the annual number of research papers of an institute is often used as a quantitative indicator for evaluating the level of its basic research. Using the bibliometric technique, we are able to evaluate for both researchers and institutions. The results of the study not only offer a comprehensive picture of asthma in children by bibliometric research, but also demonstrate the performance of research workers, institutions, and even countries. In the following analysis, we attempt to provide an exhaustive inventory of all papers concerning asthma in children published during 1991\u20132002.",

The total paper production showed two obvious peaks in 1993 and 1999. An increasing trend of the top 10 countries producing publications also showed the same peaks in the same years. The contribution of the publication peak was affected by Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Canada in 1993 as well as by UK, France, Japan, and Sweden in 1999. The overall article production showed a growth pattern, in which the number papers per year increased by about two times in the following decade since 1991. A similar increasing trend in the number of countries is also apparent in Fig. 2. In addition, a significant correlation between yearly cumulative number of publications and the year was also made (Fig. 3\n). For the period from 1991 to 2002, the cumulative number of publications on relative research on asthma in children has increased. Ninety-eight papers were published in 1991, while in 2002 the cumulative number of publications was 1704. The relationship between yearly cumulative number of publications and year was analyzed by using linear, logistic, and exponential equations. Linear and logistic equations had high coefficient of determinations of 0.992 and 0.998 respectively. Linear fitting suggested that yearly publications were constantly sustained in each year. The logistic curve fitting, however, showed that yearly publications had a constant growth rate. It can be concluded that the number of publications on research on the topic of asthma in children is still growing by a small rate.",

Among these countries, the G7 published 69.7% of the 1640 papers. Moreover, G7 had high productivity in this topic, which included 861 (52.5% of 1640 papers) independent publications. The UK (71) and US (70) produced the most international collaborative papers followed by Sweden (28), Germany (26), and Australia (19).
