However, the structure and function of nsp2 from either SARS-CoV or related coronaviruses have remained uncharacterized. To date, the only reported crystal structure of a coronavirus nsp2 is that of the N-terminal domain of nsp2 from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; Yang et al., 2009 \u25b6), a representive of the group 3 coronaviruses which is quite different from SARS-CoV nsp2 in primary sequence (with a sequence identity of less than 20%) and gene locus (with no nsp1 prior to nsp2 in IBV). Meanwhile, owing to a lack of research on nsp2-deficient viruses in animal models or on changes in host environment resulting from nsp2 deficiency, it has been widely accepted that nsp2 replicase proteins are dispensable for replication of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV in cell culture owing to the detection of genomic and sub\u00adgenomic RNA production of nsp2-deficient viruses in cell culture (Graham et al., 2005 \u25b6).",

The PCR product was digested by BamHI and NotI and ligated into a pGEX-6p-1 expression vector (Pharmacia, New York, USA). The integrity of the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. SARS-CoV nsp2C was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Merck, USA) as a GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion protein. A seleno\u00admethionyl (SeMet) derivative of nsp2C was prepared using the method of methionine-biosynthesis pathway inhibition. Expression of native and SeMet-derivative nsp2C was performed in 0.8 l Luria\u2013Bertani medium and M9 medium, respectively, which was incubated at 310 K until the OD600 reached about 0.6. SARS-CoV nsp2C expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2-\u00add-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for an additional 16 h at 289 K. For the preparation of soluble protein fractions, cells from the 0.8 l culture were pelleted, resuspended in 50 ml cold PBS as a lysis buffer containing 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and 0.01% NP-40 pH 8.5 and lysed using a JN-3000 PLUS low-temperature ultrahigh-pressure cell disrupter (JNBIO, Guangzhou, People\u2019s Republic of China).",

The anomalous data provided four clear selenium sites. The initial phases were improved by solvent flattening (DM; Winn et al., 2011 \u25b6) and the electron-density map allowed us to trace most of the main-chain residues of SARS-CoV nsp2C. After several iterations of density modification using both the DM and SHARP programs, the phases were greatly improved, with most of the amino-acid residues being clearly interpretable (Fig. 4 \u25b6); exceptions were the C-terminal end, which consists mostly of loop and coil, as well as electron density in some regions owing to flexibility. Further model building and refinement of the structure of SARS-CoV nsp2C is in progress. The successful crystallization of nsp2C from SARS-CoV to give crystals that were suitable for structure determination should allow us to answer many of the fundamental questions that remain unclear about the role(s) of nsp2 in the regulation of coronavirus pathogenesis.",
