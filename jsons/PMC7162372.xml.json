In 2006, an estimated 1.5 to 2.7 million deaths were the result of malaria and most of the deaths occurred in children under five years old. Malaria is caused by blood parasites of the Plasmodium species. P. falciparum is the most widespread and dangerous Plasmodium because it can lead to host death. The burden of malaria is currently increasing because of drug and insecticide resistance and social and environmental changes.",

Indeed, combination therapies are preferred to monotherapies as they prevent the development of resistant parasites. These ART therapies associate fast\u2010acting ART\u2010derived drugs with other antimalarials with longer half\u2010lives such as mefloquine (MF).

On another hand, redox activation from the ferrocene to the ferricinium and its implication in radical(s) generation cannot be excluded and is currently under investigation. Moreover, the metallocene altered the shape, volume, lipophilicity, basicity, and electronic profile of the parent molecule and consequently, its pharmacodynamic behavior.
