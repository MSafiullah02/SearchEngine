            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) designated \u201cSARS-associated CoV\u201d (SARS-CoV) [1]. Three known antigenic groups of CoVs are associated with diseases in animals and humans [2]. The known human CoVs (HCoVs)\u2014HCoV-229E, in CoV group 1, and HCoV-OC43, in CoV group 2\u2014are generally recognized to cause mild upper respiratory tract diseases and, rarely, lower respiratory tract diseases [2]. Phylogenetic analyses show that SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of the previously characterized CoVs [3]. However, some investigators, using SARS-CoV\u2014infected Vero cells in immunohistochemical antibody tests, have observed cross-reactions between SARS-CoV and group I CoVs, but seroepidemiological studies revealed that there were no cross-reactions with SARS-CoV\u2014infected Vero cells in 13 and 14 paired serum samples from patients with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, respectively [1]. Serum samples from group I CoV-infected animals also cross-reacted with the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV [4]. Results of the recombinant nucleocapsid protein\u2014based ELISA were positive in 1.04% of serum samples from healthy blood donors [5]. The nature of this antigenic cross-reactivity is still unknown. In the present study, we cloned the nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43 and produced specific animal antisera to determine if the nucleocapsid protein is responsible for the observed antigenic cross-reactivity. In addition, the antigenic relationships among SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43 were further studied using serum samples from healthy donors and patients with SARS.",

The antibody titers to HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV are shown in table 1. To determine which viral antigen was responsible for the cross-reactions, the culture filtrate from cells infected with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 was immunoblotted with the paired serum samples. A strong band at \u223c44 kDa, the same molecular weight at which there was a reaction with a specific monoclonal antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-229E, was observed in convalescent- phase samples from 2 patients with SARS (figure 1C). These serum samples also displayed higher antibody titers in the HCoV-229E nucleocapsid protein\u2014based ELISA. The paired serum samples from the 9 other patients also had a weak or moderate reactive band at \u223c44 kDa when they were immunoblotted with HCoV-229E. Acute-phase or convalescent-phase serum from 11 paired serum samples had a weak reactive band at \u223c50 kDa, the same molecular weight at which there was a reaction with a specific monoclonal antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-OC43 when it was immunoblotted with HCoV-OC43 (data not shown).",

In our previous studies, neither specific monoclonal nor polyclonal antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV crossreacted with HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 [8, 10]. However, a previous study has described cross-reactivity between the nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV and those of group I CoVs [4]. This cross-reactivity may depend on the type of serum used. Another investigator has demonstrated that HCoV-229E\u2014immune animal serum cross-reacted with SARS-CoV [1]. In the present study, when we used immunofluorescent staining of CoV-infected cells, HCoV-229E\u2014 and HCoV-OC43\u2014immune rabbit serum did not cross-react with SARS-CoV\u2014infected cells, whereas SARS-CoV\u2014immune rabbit serum had moderate cross-reactivity with HCoV-229E\u2014infected cells and weak cross-reactivity with HCoV-OC43\u2014infected cells. Although SARS-CoV\u2014immune rabbit serum that had high antibody titers for SARS-CoV was slightly contaminated with antibodies to host cell components, it is apparent that the serum had cross-reactivity with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. In addition, the IFA showed that HCoV-OC43\u2014immune rabbit serum had strong cross-reactivity with HCoV-229E. This cross-reactivity has been observed by some investigators [11, 12] but not by others [13, 14]. It is possible that some antibodies in the rabbit serum reacted against the host cells or cross-reacted with HCoV-229E.",

            "text": "Because the 2 known HCoVs are responsible for \u223c30% of all common colds [2], it is not unexpected that 97% and 99% of serum samples from healthy donors had antibodies to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, respectively. Therefore, it is expected that the antibodies to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 found in the serum samples from patients with SARS either preexisted or were cross-reacting antibodies to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Further studies of this issue are warranted. The IFA showed that paired serum samples exhibited a \u2a7e4-fold increase in antibody titers against HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in 5 of 11 and 10 of 11 patients with SARS, respectively. Such a high antibody titer response to the known HCoVs in patients with SARS may represent an anamnestic reaction to previous infections with the 2 known HCoVs or other CoVs or a crossreaction between SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43. However, the nucleocapsid protein\u2014based ELISA detected increases in antibody titers in only 2 of 11 paired serum samples from patients with SARS when the nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-229E was used as an antigen, and they had a consistently increased signal reaction to the nucleocapsid protein from HCoV-229E\u2014infected cell culture filtrate by Western blot analysis (figure 1C). Paired serum samples from patients with SARS showed no consistent increase in antibody titers in the HCoV-OC43 nucleocapsid protein\u2014based ELISA and no increase in signal reaction to the nucleocapsid protein from HCoV-OC43\u2014infected cell culture filtrate by Western blot analysis. These results confirm the suggestion that the major antigenic crossreactivity with HCoV-OC43 in the convalescent-phase serum samples of patients with SARS is due not to nucleocapsid proteins but to other viral components. Although the paired serum samples from patients with SARS showed a partial cross-reaction to HCoV-229E, there was no significant close correlation between the IFA titer ratios, which were determined in response to whole virus\u2014infected cells, and the ELISA titer ratios, which were determined in response to nucleocapsid proteins. Furthermore, antibodies to SARS-CoV could be detected in only 1 serum sample from a healthy donor by either IFA or nucleocapsid protein\u2013based Western blot analysis, even though patients with SARS had antibodies to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Therefore, there is no serological cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV in healthy donors even though they have a high reactivity to HCoVs [15].",
