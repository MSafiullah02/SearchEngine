            "text": "The 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has overwhelmed healthcare systems across the world, and has also affected specialized practices such as vascular surgery. The first case in the United States was diagnosed on January 19, 2020. This prompted many healthcare systems, including our institution, to initiate preemptive measures in preparation for the anticipated surge of patients. The first case in Minnesota was diagnosed on March 4, first death on March 21, and the projected daily death peak is April 26. 1,2 Recommendations on social distancing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the subsequent state-wide stay at home order in Minnesota, are aimed at slowing viral spread and providing more time for hospital preparation for the surge. 3, 4 In light of these recommendations, we instituted drastic changes to our clinical practice on March 23 in accordance with the American College of Surgeons COVID recommendations for elective procedures. 5 This process involved postponing all elective procedures, with the exception of those deemed necessary for immediately life-or limb-threatening conditions. Each case that has subsequently been performed has required independent review and approval by leadership from our section. To ensure postponed procedures are not overlooked in the future, a database has been developed and is maintained prospectively at the time of case rescheduling. The majority of outpatient visits have also been transitioned to virtual visits with phone conversations, chart review, and limited imaging to protect clinic personnel. To better understand the implications of this practice change, we reviewed all cases scheduled to occur within the first 16 days after its institution. A total of 46 elective procedures were scheduled between March 23 and April 8, with 43 cases (93%) being rescheduled or postponed. This included 16 outpatient vein procedures (37%), 5 patients with claudication (12%), 3 aortic aneurysms (7%), 2 with critical limb ischemia (CLI; 5%), and 2 asymptomatic carotid stenoses (5%). Of the patients with CLI, one had a slow-healing small toe wound and one had stable rest pain. One patient with carotid stenosis and a recent transient ischemic attach was postponed for only 2 weeks while new practice protocols were being established.",
