Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay [2 , 3] . Several drugs have already been tested, among which chloroquine (CLQ), a well-known antimalarial drug, is one of the most promising as it has shown apparent efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia in recent clinical studies [4] . However, the mechanism of action of CLQ against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear as the drug seems to exert a broad range of potential antiviral effects [5] . Therefore, although CLQ is classically considered as an inhibitor of endocytic pathways through elevation of endoso-mal pH [6] , its detailed molecular mechanism of action as an antiviral compound remains unclear [3 , 5] . Interestingly, CLQ has been shown to interfere with the terminal glycosylation of angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) [7] , which acts as a plasma membrane receptor for both SARS-CoV [8] and SARS-CoV-2 [9] , and CLQ could act at several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle [7] .

Molecular modelling approaches were used to assess whether CLQ and CLQ-OH can recognize sialic acid units in their natural molecular environment. In these simulations, ganglioside GM1 was chosen as a representative example of human plasma membrane gangliosides. A first series of simulations was performed with CLQ. When merged with the ganglioside, CLQ had two distinct binding sites, both located in the polar saccharide part of GM1. The first site was located at the tip of the saccharide moiety of the ganglioside Fig. 4 (a,b). The energy of interaction was estimated to be -47 kJ.mol \u22121 . CLQ retained the typical L-shape structure of the water-soluble conformer bound to isolated sialic acids [compare Figs 2 (c) and 4 (a)]. From a mechanistic point of view, the carboxylate group of the sialic acid of GM1 was oriented towards the cationic groups of CLQ. The rings of CLQ faced the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue of GM1, establishing both OH-\u03c0 interaction and hydrogen bonding Fig. 4 (b). The second site was in a large area including both the ceramide-sugar junction and the saccharide moiety Fig. 4 (c). The chlorine atom of CLQ was oriented towards the ceramide axis, allowing the nitrogen-containing ring of CLQ to stack on to the pyrane ring of the first sugar residue [i.e. glucose (Glc)]. The perfect geometric complementarity of the two partners Fig. 4 (c,d) accounted for a particularly high energy of interaction in this case (-61 kJ.mol \u22121 ). Interestingly, there was no overlap between the two CLQ-binding sites on GM1, so the ganglioside could accommodate two CLQ molecules Fig. 4 (e) , reaching a global energy of interaction of -108 kJ.mol \u22121 . A similar situation was observed with CLQ-OH, which occupies the same binding site as CLQ Fig. 4 (f).

The NTD contains approximately 290 amino acid residues. The tip of the NTD was of particular interest, as it displays a flat interface Fig. 5 (f) ideally positioned for targeting a ganglioside-rich plasma membrane microdomain, such as a lipid raft. The amino acid sequence of the planar interfacial surface located at the tip of the NTD was analysed for the presence of consensus ganglioside-binding domains [20] . These motifs are constituted by a triad of mandatory amino acid residues such as (K,R)-X n -(F,Y,W)-X n -(K,R). The X n intercalating segments, usually four to five residues, may contain any amino acid, but often Gly, Pro and/or Ser residues. The strict application of this algorithm did not allow the detection of any potential ganglioside-binding domain in this region of the NTD.

Several amino acid residues appear to be critical for this interaction, especially Phe-135, Asn-137 and Arg-158 ( Table 1 ) . Overall, the complex involved 10 amino acid residues for a total energy of interaction of -100 kJ.mol \u22121 . At this stage, it was observed that approximately 50% of the interface was involved in the complex, leaving the remaining 50% available for interaction with a second GM1 molecule. As expected, merging a second GM1 molecule with the preformed GM1-NTD complex led to a trimolecular complex consisting of two gangliosides in a typical symmetrical chalice-like structure into which the NTD could insert its interfacial ganglioside-binding domain ( Fig. 7 ) . The formation of this trimolecular complex was progressive, starting with a conformational rearrangement of the first ganglioside-NTD complex triggered by the second GM1 molecule. The energy of interaction of the new complex was consistently increased by 37%, reaching an estimated value of -137 kJ.mol \u22121 .

This superposition shows that the NTD and the drug (CLQ-OH in this case) share the same spatial position when bound to GM1, so GM1 cannot bind the viral protein and the drug simultaneously. This is due to the fact that the NTD and the drugs (CLQ and CLQ-OH) bind to GM1 with a similar mechanism controlled by a dyad of functional interactions: a hydrogen bond and a geometrically perfect CH-\u03c0 stacking interaction. In the case of the NTD, the hydrogen bond involves Asn-167, whereas CH-\u03c0 stacking is mediated by the aromatic ring of Phe-135 Fig. 6 (b) . On Fig. 4 .

In the above view of (d), the anchorage of the NTD to the gangliosides is particularly obvious. As chloroquine also interacts with the saccharide part of GM1, its presence would clearly mask most of the landing surface available for the NTD, preventing attachment of the virus to the plasma membrane of host cells. one hand, Asn-167 establishes a network of hydrogen bonds with the GalNAc residue of GM1.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 interact with the ACE-2 protein, which has been identified as a key determinant of the contagiousness of viruses [8] . However, considering the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV, binding to ACE-2 alone might not be enough to ensure robust infection of the upper respiratory tract. Thus, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 might also bind to other cell surface attachment factors, such as sialic-acid-containing glycoproteins and gangliosides. Consistent with this notion, it has been shown that depletion of cell surface sialic acids by neuraminidase treatment inhibited MERS-CoV entry of human airway cells [25] . These data, which provide direct evidence that sialic acids play a critical role in human coronavirus attachment, broaden the therapeutic options to block the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 145, "end": 149, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 247, "end": 251, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 270, "end": 279, "text": "[22 , 23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 499, "end": 507, "text": "[9 , 24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 647, "end": 650, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1170, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Few drugs have shown consistent antiviral efficiency in vitro together with reported efficiency in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [3 , 12] .

However, the new SARS-CoV-2 motif is organized into three distinct regions, including a central aromatic domain and two terminal basic domains ( Fig. 10 ) .

Interestingly, these simulations indicated that CLQ-OH is more potent than CLQ, in line with the reported increased antiviral activity of CLQ-OH against SARS-CoV-2 [30] . Once bound to GM1, the drugs prevent any access to the Glc and GalNAc units of the ganglioside, which are the critical binding residues for Phe-135 and Asn-137, respectively. This amino acid dyad, as well as all the other residues that mediate ganglioside binding by the SARS-CoV-2 spike, is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide. It is also conserved in the bat RaTG13 isolate, which reinforces the hypothesis of bat-to-human transmission. From an epidemiological point of view, it can be hypothesized that the evolution of this motif has conferred an enhanced attachment capacity of human coronaviruses to the respiratory tract through improved S-ganglioside interactions.
