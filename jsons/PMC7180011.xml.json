In the patients who are critically ill, infected alveolar epithelial cells trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines, which activates fibroblasts. Subsequently, uncontrolled viral propagation induces cytotoxicity and hyperactivation of immune cells. The cytokine storm leads to increased clotting, vascular inflammation, thromboembolism, and hypotensive shock.",

Given the role of the HPA axis in stress priming the immune response, patients with adrenal insufficiency are intuitively at high risk of infection, especially as corticosteroid therapy during infection is still largely tailored empirically, often disregarding timing and dosage. The rationale of the more the better avoids risking inadequate concentrations of corticosteroids. However, mild COVID-19 symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, gastrointestinal symptoms, and diarrhoea are common in patients with adrenal insufficiency, and patients' fears might lead them to increase their dose unnecessarily. Establishing the correct timing of stress dose administration relative to the degree of inflammatory damage and the desired effect on the immune system is crucial\u2014ie, not too early, not too late.",

In cases of persistent fever or progression of respiratory damage to severe pneumonia, an initial bolus of 50\u2013100 mg of hydrocortisone followed by continuous intravenous infusion of 200 mg of hydrocortisone would be the most appropriate replacement for patients with adrenal insufficiency.7 Such regimen can reduce the harmful effects of peaks and troughs of hydrocortisone on the immune system,7 and the length of stay in an intensive care unit.8 Hydration and electrolyte balance should also be corrected promptly, as severe hypotension is very frequent with disease progression. There is also increasing concern over the disseminated thromboembolic disease observed in severe COVID-19. Given the coagulation abnormalities associated with glucocorticoid use, low molecular weight heparin should be introduced early.9\n",
