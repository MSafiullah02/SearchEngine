In the same study SARS-HCoV was also isolated from intestinal tissue and viral RNA was found in 16% of stool samples, which was comparable to the detection rate in nasopharyngeal aspirates.18 In another cohort of patients diarrhea was seen in 73% of patients and viral RNA was detected in 97% of stool specimens. In this cohort it was suggested that the outbreak was caused by faulty sewage system whereby the transmission might been fecal\u2013oral rather than respiratory.19 No association between the presence of diarrhea and mortality in SARS cases has been observed, however.20\n",

Most of the coronavirus findings were co-infections with well known enteric pathogens, norovirus and rotavirus. Furthermore, half of the patients with coronavirus in stools had symptoms related to respiratory tract infection and, therefore, HCoVs found in the stools could have originated from respiratory tract. Unfortunately, no specimens from respiratory tract were collected to confirm the presence of coronaviruses in the respiratory tract in these patients, and further studies are needed to evaluate simultaneous presence of HCoV in stools and respiratory tract. Even if coronaviruses were found in respiratory tract in cases of acute gastroenteritis it would be difficult to determine whether they were primarily causing the respiratory or gastrointestinal symptom.",
