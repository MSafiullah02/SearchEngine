Several diseases and disorders are known to be caused by genetic variation within components of the immune system, for example in interferon (IFN)-mediated host immunity pathways [1, 2]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful tool to link genetic polymorphisms to specific diseases and have enabled the identification of markers associated with pathogens including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus, malaria, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis[3].",

As the predominant IFN induced in response to respiratory viruses [26], IFN-\u03bb contributes considerably to the control of viral infections of the respiratory tract, including influenza A virus [27, 28, 29], human metapneumovirus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [30]. Although only expressed in a minority of individuals, IFN-\u03bb4 exerts anti-viral activities against HCV and 2 human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, despite its relatively low level of expression [9, 31]. The capacity of cells to respond to IFN-\u03bb is determined by the expression of the IL28RA receptor subunit which is predominantly expressed on hepatocytes and cells of epithelial origin [8, 10, 32, 33]. This restricted receptor expression and the consequent tissue-specific anti-viral effects suggest a major role for IFN-\u03bb in the protection of the epithelium from viral infection [34, 35, 36].",

In the context of IFN-\u03bb3 polymorphisms, the high LD observed between rs12979860 and rs368234815 (r2 = 0.988) gives the latter SNP limited use as a marker in this population (fig. 2) [49].

Of the numerous SNPs within the IFN-\u03bb locus (fig. 1), many are located in the promoter region and could directly influence protein expression by altering the transcription factor binding affinity or chromatin accessibility [61, 62]. For example, SNPs rs12978960, rs4803221 and rs368234815 are proposed to be located within a CpG island [17, 45, 62, 63]. Methylation and deamination at CpG islands cause epigenetic changes promoting the recruitment of proteins associated with less transcriptionally active heterochromatic DNA and thus may alter IFN-\u03bb3 expression. Whilst a recent investigation into the transcriptional regulation of IFN-\u03bb suggested that the majority of the control occurs within the first kilo base pair upstream of IL28B, excluding both rs12979860 and rs8099917, it is well established that the risk alleles at these SNPs (T and G, respectively) alter the mRNA and protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, sera and the liver in HCV patients as well as healthy individuals [5, 6, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69].",

Considering the substantial side effect burden of IFN therapy, patients may be reluctant to start treatment, but knowledge of their IL28B genotype and likely response to treatment can facilitate a more informed decision. However, the truly remarkable efficacy of new direct-acting anti-viral agents for the treatment of genotype 1, 2 and 3 HCV infections means that the pegylated IFN and ribavarin therapy regime is now all but obsolete [75, 76].

The minor T allele at rs12979860 was found to be associated with the severity and frequency of oral herpes labialis recurrence [20]. A more recent study in HIV-infected patients found that individuals homozygous for the \u0394G mutation at SNP rs368234815 had a higher incidence of developing CMV retinitis [77]. Infection of retinal epithelial cells by CMV causes retinal damage resulting in blindness, and the reduced IFN-\u03bb3 expression as a result of this \u0394G mutation may contribute to higher replication levels of CMV and an increased likelihood of developing retinitis. IFN-\u03bb SNPs have also been investigated in the context of HIV \u2018controllers\u2019 who suppress the HIV viral load in the absence of therapy. One such study found the protective rs12979860 CC genotype to be associated with spontaneous HIV control; however, in addition to having very low numbers in comparison to non-controllers (53 vs. 389), this group also had a high rate of HCV co-infection, making firm conclusions difficult [78].",

As a virus predominantly infecting CD4+ T-lymphocytes, the relevance of IFN-\u03bb polymorphisms and generally a type III IFN response in HTLV-1 infection and associated inflammatory diseases is not clear, and further studies in larger cohorts are required to fully understand this and the role of IFN-\u03bb in the development of virus-induced cancers.",

This apparent negative link between IFN-\u03bb and disease prognosis raises the possibility that overexpression of IFN-\u03bb may actually be detrimental to patient health, particularly in the context of respiratory infections.

This disparity in C allele frequency correlates with the observed clinical differences between these populations, where East Asians have a more than 3 times greater rate of HCV clearance [42, 97]. The ethnicity-dependent distribution of the protective CC genotype also partially explains the differences in SVR between African Americans and European Americans, where chronic infection occurs more often in people of African descent (76.4%) compared to Caucasian populations (44%) [4]. Such variation in allele frequencies is also likely to contribute to the global variations in \u2018predictor\u2019 genotypes, such as the SNPs rs8099917 and rs368134815 being the strongest predictors of HCV therapy outcome in Japanese and African populations, respectively [9, 43]. Intra-regional variation in SNP allele frequencies is also noted, with CC frequencies ranging from 80% in Asian Australians to 19% in Mediterranean Australians (fig. 3b) [98], and this high level of variation even within the relatively small population of Australians (\u223c23 million) should be considered when utilising genotypes for patient stratification.",

However, this does not explain the high prevalence of the so-called \u2018risk\u2019 T allele at this SNP in populations such as the Australian Aboriginal and Mediterranean populations. In some well-known genetic disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia, individuals homozygous for the mutation in question suffer severe disease, whilst the heterozygosity actually confers a level of protection against malaria. It is possible, therefore, that the risk allele at rs12979860 may confer some as yet unidentified genetic advantage to some populations whilst simultaneously rendering others susceptible to chronic diseases such as HCV.",

Such a gender bias has also been observed in allergic disease, where a study of the rs12979860 SNP found that female children with the \u2018protective\u2019 CC genotype had decreased rates of allergy-associated epidermis symptoms [87].",

            "text": "Since its discovery in 2003, there has been an explosion of data describing the possible roles type III IFN in infectious and non-infectious human disease. Whilst the assessment of host genetics contributes to diagnostic and therapy options in oncology, this is surprisingly underexploited in other fields of medicine. The IL28B polymorphism rs12979860 is the only host SNP to be used as a genetic biomarker for infectious diseases, and genotyping at this locus is incorporated into patient stratification for the clinical management of HCV infection [100]. Whilst the link between IFN-\u03bb polymorphisms and HCV infection is the most robust and well described, this review has highlighted a number of other infectious and inflammatory diseases in which polymorphisms affecting IFN-\u03bb expression or signalling have been implicated. The data for many of these diseases, however, remain unconvincing. Many studies have been limited by often very small sample sizes and small effect sizes, and variations in patient characteristics make inter-study comparisons difficult. Given the levels of intra-regional genotype variation within some populations, caution should be used when interpreting the population stratification in such association studies, particularly in those with relatively high p values. Finally, the existence of LD between SNPs within the IFN-\u03bb locus makes it difficult to assign causality to an individual polymorphism. However, it seems likely that host polymorphisms affecting the IFN-\u03bb signalling axis will play a key role in the advancing field of novel host biomarkers for patient management and differential therapy.",
