However, worldwide more than 34 million people are still living with the disease (UNAIDS, 2011). Furthermore, in sub-Saharan Africa, the most heavily HIV affected region, it is estimated that only 6.6% of the population have been tested for HIV in 2009 (UNAIDS, 2010). Thus, globally there still exists a huge reservoir of HIV-infected people with the potential to infect millions more. Despite commendable research efforts over nearly 30 years, a protective HIV vaccine is still not available. Thus, it has become crucial to develop other strategies for disease prevention, such as microbicides that would effectively block the initial transmission of the virus.",

Due to these difficult socioeconomic conditions a successful microbicide should further lend itself to formulations that can be applied topically or orally in order for women to self-manage the use of it (Moscicki, 2008). The microbicide development field received a boost with the progress made in CAPRISA004 studies where it was demonstrated that a microbicide gel containing 1% tenofovir, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, could prevent the risk of HIV infection by 38% (Karim et al., 2010).",

These were broad acting and failed to produce effective HIV inhibition, even enhancing infection in some instances (Van Damme et al., 2002). Of these, N-9 was the first surfactant that was tested in a clinical trial (Garg et al., 2009). Although no adverse effects were reported for N-9 in preclinical and Phase I clinical trials, genital ulcers, irritation, inflammation and subsequent higher HIV risk were reported from Phase III trials (Garg et al., 2009, Moscicki, 2008). Further surfactant development as microbicides faded under the risk of vaginal damage and inconclusive clinical trials.",

In this class of microbicides Acidform (Amphora, Instead Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) and BufferGel (Carbopol 974P, ReProtect, Baltimore, MD, USA) have been evaluated extensively, displayed good contraceptive properties and were shown to be well tolerated in human subjects (Mayer et al., 2001). Whilst in vitro anti-HIV activity has been reported for Acidform, it has only been subjected to safety and acceptability pre-clinical studies (reviewed by Cutler and Justman, 2008; http://www.insteadsciences.com/amphora.htm#results). BufferGel failed to show reduction of HIV infectivity when compared to the placebo gel in a study that evaluated its effectiveness in reduction of HIV incidence in a high risk study group (Karim et al., 2011). It is thus likely that these vaginal milieu protectors will not be effective in preventing HIV transmission in single formulations and will probably be used in combination with other antiviral entities. In fact, Carbopol 974P is being used as the polymer base to formulate gels for the application of reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as tenofovir and UC781 (Garg et al., 2010). Other strategies to maintain a healthy mucosal environment include the restoration of the microflora population by products such as Lactin V and MucoCept from Osel, Santa Clara, CA, USA (Moscicki, 2008).",

            "text": "Over the past two decades plants have been extensively investigated as alternative production systems for pharmaceutical proteins. Even with careful consideration of existing production systems, plants provide several attractive features that are equivalent or more beneficial (Mett et al., 2008, Twyman et al., 2003, Twyman et al., 2005). Like mammalian and yeast cells, plants possess the cellular machinery which enables them to perform the post translational modifications essential for maturation and sometimes function of proteins. Unlike mammalian fermentation systems, plants are not at risk of being contaminated with human pathogens. Furthermore compared to mammalian and yeast systems, plant production systems are more easily scaled up; plants can either be propagated in large numbers in designated land plots or in contained greenhouses. Maintenance of plants in soil, hydroponic or cell culture is simple and cheap compared to the complex growth media and requirements of yeast and mammalian cell systems (Kn\u00e4blein, 2005). Furthermore, plants provide a huge biomass in the form of green leafy tissue or as the numerous seeds of certain crops. The latter provides a further advantage of stable storage over longer time periods and high protein content that can be exploited for recombinant protein production (Cunha et al., 2011a, Cunha et al., 2011b, Lau and Sun, 2009). Whilst costs of downstream processing remain as high as that required for purifying proteins made from conventional systems, the burden can be alleviated by maximising production yields and utilising innovative purification strategies to improve product recovery (Paul and Ma, 2011). Thus, for plant production systems the upfront investment required for infrastructure is lower, which potentially lowers the barriers to entry by more players or especially players in developing countries.",

Icon Genetics GmbH (Halle, Germany) developed a deconstructed viral vector system initially based on Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in which target genes and different viral vector components are carried on several pro-module vectors (Marillonnet et al., 2004). In this system the viral coat protein has been removed to eliminate systemic spread. Instead agroinfiltration provides the delivery of the modules to the plant cell and limits replication to the infiltrated area. In the cell, high-level expression is facilitated by a RNA dependent RNA polymerase. A site-specific recombinase facilitates the assembly of the modules into a DNA molecule which is transcribed and spliced into a functional transcript. The transcript moves to the cytosol where it is translated into the specified protein. Alternatively target signals can be incorporated to direct proteins to specified subcellular compartments (Marillonnet et al., 2004). This system has been used to accumulate various proteins at levels over 4 g/kg plant material (Bendandi et al., 2010).",

In the full-length system (wild type, wt) the coding sequence for the protein of interest is fused to the C-terminus of the RNA-2 polypeptide which is co-translationally released via 2A-peptide mediated cleavage (Sainsbury and Lomonossoff, 2008). Replication is facilitated by the co-expression of RNA-1. The full-length version allows for local co-expression of two different proteins; however segregation of the co-expressed proteins occurs with systemic movement (Sainsbury et al., 2008). A deleted CPMV version of RNA-1 (hypertranslatable, HT) was developed which lacked the ability of systemic spread and was thus able to co-express more than one protein without the occurrence of segregation. Moreover the deleted CPMV system obtained higher expression levels than the full-length version (Sainsbury et al., 2008, Sainsbury et al., 2010). Using this system, protein expression levels exceeded 0.3 g/kg protein (Sainsbury and Lomonossoff, 2008).",

(2010) and Regnard et al. (2010) have independently developed vector systems based on the DNA genome of the virus. The BeYDV system requires only two viral components for co-expressing heteromeric proteins: these are the long intergenic region (LIR) and the short intergenic region (SIR) control sequences, and the single alternatively spliced gene for the replication-associated proteins Rep/RepA. In the system non-competing co-expression can be achieved either from two replicons encoding different proteins, or from a single replicon containing the different proteins. In Nicotiana benthamiana, transient expression levels from the BeYDV vector were 3- to 7-fold more for EGFP and HIV-1 p24 compared to levels obtained using a binary pTRA Agrobacterium tumefaciens vector (Regnard et al., 2010). Furthermore, expression with BeYDV resulted in accumulation levels of 0.5 g/kg monoclonal antibody against Ebola virus GP1 (mAb 6D8) (Huang et al., 2010). It is anticipated that the system will be able to simultaneously produce as many as four different protein subunits. Several other geminiviruses and also the multicomponent ssDNA nanoviruses have been investigated for their potential as expression vectors; their further development could greatly expand the range of plant species that can be used for transient production of recombinant proteins (Rybicki and Martin, 2011).",

            "text": "In eukaryotes the N-glycan biosynthesis pathway is conserved for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Kukuruzinska and Lennon, 1998). Variations between species occur in modifications to glycan structures in processing steps after the protein exits from the ER. In plants these variations depend on the protein itself, plant species and plant organ used for expression (Gomord et al., 2010). Unless the plant glycosylated form of the therapeutic protein is more attractive as is the case with the carrot cell produced glucocerebrosidase (Shaaltiel et al., 2007), it is considered more ideal if plants are able to produce therapeutic proteins that have mammal-like glycans. Where glycan structure is not critical to protein function, recombinant proteins without glycan structures are desirable (Rodriguez et al., 2004). Therapeutic proteins that are produced as aglycosylated forms are only feasible if the proteins need to stimulate an inflammatory response or in the case of a recombinantly produced antibody that does not require an effector function since glycan structures are often crucial for this biological function of the protein (Jefferis, 2009). The current gel formulation of HIV neutralising antibodies (Morris and Lacey, 2010) and peptide lectins (Tsai et al., 2003) suggests that these microbicides will most likely be applied topically. When these are exposed to the mucosal surfaces it will only have a limited interaction with the immune system and thus not cause inflammation. Thus for the production of these microbicides in plants the nature of the glycan structures on these microbicides might not be as important as the yield obtained.",

            "text": "Another means to produce a protein that more closely resembles a humanised glycan profile is to restrict the recombinant protein to the ER by using KDEL, HDEL or SEKDEL ER retention signals (Ko et al., 2003, Triguero et al., 2005). For regulatory purposes it is generally regarded as \u201csafer\u201d to produce a native version of the protein (Fischer et al., 2012). However in the case of ER retention signals regulatory approval might be less stringent seeing that these sequences are also found in mammalian proteins. Of note is that Protalix's carrot cell produced glucocerebrosidase, which has just received FDA approval, was produced with a storage vacuole targeting signal (Shaaltiel et al., 2007). Another argument for ER retention is that for the production of some proteins, ER retention is needed to increase the accumulation levels (Bortesi et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2005). On the other hand ER retention can result in the degradation of the protein or low stability and reduced half life of the therapeutic in vivo (Ko et al., 2003, Loos et al., 2010). Studies have also shown that ER retention of recombinantly produced proteins is not always successfully achieved, leading to some proteins leaking from the ER that are then further processed to contain complex immunogenic plant glycans (Floss et al., 2008, Loos et al., 2010, Rademacher et al., 2008).",

In these mutants, plant specific \u03b11,3-fucose and \u03b21,2-xylose residues are replaced by complex N-acetylglucosamine (GnGn) structures.

In leaves, expression was driven by the 35S CaMV promoter without any ER retention signals. The antibody levels varied between 0.05 and 0.2% TSP in both the wildtype (wt) and \u0394XT/FT line (Sch\u00e4hs et al., 2007). The glycans on the antibody that was produced in the \u0394XT/FT line were mainly terminal N-acetylglucosamine (Gn) residues that lacked plant-specific \u03b2 1,2-xylose and \u03b11,3-fucose residues. A small population of the antibody molecules produced contained OMT residues indicating that the processing of all antibodies was incomplete. Notably, the binding capacity of the \u0394XT/FT produced 2G12 antibody was similar to the CHO produced 2G12.",

The heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) were expressed with SEKDEL retention sequences in tandem under control of the 35S CaMV promoter in Nicotiana tabacum L. cv bright yellow (BY-2) cell cultures (Sack et al., 2007). Accumulation of 2F5 reached a maximum of 2.9 mg/kg fresh weight and was further enriched by protein-A purification to 6.44 mg/kg wet cell weight. No degradation products were observed following purification, however minor impurities were detected. N-glycans were expected to be of the OMT, but this was not confirmed by analyses. Fc region binding between the BY-2 and CHO produced 2F5 was equivalent. However, the antigen binding capacity of CHO produced 2F5 (97%) was slightly superior to the plant derived 2F5 (89%). In HIV neutralisation studies the BY-2 produced antibody was threefold less efficient than the CHO produced counterpart. This lower potency was attributed either to the presence of impurities, the added SEKDEL motif or different glycan structures that could have interfered with the antibody access to the epitope.",

The ELP peptide has been used to facilitate accumulation of proteins in green leaf tissue (Patel et al., 2007). Four transgenes; HC unfused, HC\u2013ELP fused, LC unfused and LC\u2013ELP fused were introduced in N. tabacum cv. Samsun NN. Plants were subsequently crossed resulting in combinations with neither gene carrying the fusion or both HC and LC carrying ELP fusions or either the HC or LC fused to ELP. Prior to crossing the transgenic lines, it was observed that the presence of ELP increased the accumulation of the chains with the LC accumulating to higher levels than the HC. In the crossed lines, the LC\u2013ELP fusion facilitated a higher accumulation of the unfused HC as well. Accumulated total soluble protein (TSP) levels reached 0.3% for the LCELP\u2013HC, 0.2% HCELP\u2013LC, 0.6% for HCELP\u2013LCELP and 0.1% for HCLC. The ELP fusion eased the purification process of the plant-produced antibodies and did not interfere with the assembly of the antibody. The glycans of the plant-produced 2F5 were mainly oligo-mannose type (OMT) with lesser amounts of complex glycans consisting of N-acetylglucosamine (GnGn), N-acetylglucosamine\u2013Xylose (GnGnX), Galactosyl\u2013N-acetylglucosamine\u2013Xylose (AGnX), N-acetylglucosamine\u2013Mannose\u2013Xylose (GnMX) and N-acetylglucosamine\u2013Xylose\u2013Fucose (GnGnXF) moieties. 2F5 variants were all similar to the CHO produced 2F5 in their antigen binding capacity.",

Both 4E10 and VRC01 were able to neutralise over 90% of the key HIV subtypes (Walker et al., 2009, Wu et al., 2010). Although VRC01 is more potent, it uses a different mode of action with the virus than 4E10. VRC01 interacts with the envelope in a way that resembles the CD41\u2013gp120 interaction (Li et al., 2011). The 4E10 epitope interaction is also somewhat complex; the antibody recognises a linear epitope adjacent to the 2F5 epitope on the membrane proximal exterior region (MPER) and interacts with the lipids on the cell membrane (Franquelim et al., 2011, Zwick et al., 2001). Whether lipid binding is involved in the broadly neutralising ability of 4E10 is still debatable (Scherer et al., 2010, Xu et al., 2010). Thus both antibodies can be used in combination against several HIV isolates.",

The glycans of the wt produced 4E10 contained N-acetylglucosamine\u2013Xylose\u2013Fucose (GnGnXF), N-acetylglucosamine (GnGn) for the XT/FX mutant and galactosylated (AA) glycans for the XT/FX GalT+ line. The later MAb form was more potent than the other plant made forms and more efficient than the CHO produced derivative in a neutralisation assay, possibly because of the galactosylated glycans that enhance the stability, half-life and functionality of the antibody.",

Unlike other neutralising antibodies that are restricted to certain conformations of the virus, in vitro studies show that b12 can bind different conformations of the envelope (Eggink et al., 2007, Zhou et al., 2007). This antibody has been shown to protect macaques in a vaginal challenge with SHIV when administered systemically or topically (Parren et al., 2001, Veazy et al., 2003). MAb b12 was expressed in the milk of female mice and displayed the same HIV neutralisation ability as the CHO cell derived antibody (Yu et al., 2010). In combination with CD4-IgG2 (Pro542), b12 potently inhibited HIV infection of cervical tissue (Hu et al., 2004). More importantly, in this combination or administered alone, MAb b12 is able to stay associated with the virus that leaves the mucosal environment on migrating cells and prevents subsequent infection of target lymphocytes (Hu et al., 2004, Van Montfort et al., 2011). Other neutralising antibodies in the study did not display this property.",

In solution, CV-N exists as a monomer or dimer depending on pH and temperature conditions (Barrientos and Gronenborn, 2002, Barrientos et al., 2004). CV-N interacts with terminal mannose residues of the oligomannose glycan structures of gp120 (Bewley and Otero-Quintero, 2001, Shenoy et al., 2001). The monomer contains two carbohydrate binding domains with different affinities to di- and trimannose respectively (Bewley and Otero-Quintero, 2001). Although anti-HIV activity has been reported for both monomeric and dimeric forms, it appears that the potency of CV-N depends more on the formation of multisite interactions with glycan residues rather than the affinity and presence of each binding domain (Barrientos et al., 2004, Fromme et al., 2007, Kelley et al., 2002).",

Furthermore, in vivo studies with gel-formulated CV-N caused no adverse effects in the test animals (Tsai et al., 2003). However, more extensive tests showed that CV-N induced the production of chemokines and cytokines and stimulated cell proliferation (Huskens et al., 2008). This cytotoxicity was however not linked to its carbohydrate-binding property. Thus with further development such as mutations or PEGylations (Zappe et al., 2008) that could potentially reduce the cytotoxicity of CV-N, the lectin might still be considered as a potential microbicide.",

Given that the infection rate of HIV is quite rapid, the microbicide should remain stable and efficacious to neutralise HIV immediately on contact. Its presence furthermore should not compromise tissue viability or initiate an inflammatory response. In the light of these criteria, preclinical test shows that GRFT is a good microbicide candidate. GRFT is virucidal upon contact with the virus and remains stable over several hours prior to or after application (Emau et al., 2007). GRFT is stable and functional in cervical lavage fluid over a wide pH range. Furthermore GRFT was not cytotoxic to human and primate cell lines, does not initiate an inflammatory response and did not cause adverse effects in a rabbit vaginal irritation model (Emau et al., 2007, O'Keefe et al., 2009). It is likely that an effective anti-HIV therapeutic will consist of more than one microbicide to limit the risk of viral resistance. It is thus important that candidate microbicides should be compatible with other microbicides without compromising efficacy and safety of the component molecules. GRFT was tested in combination with tenofovir (nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor), maraviroc (CCR5 HIV co-receptor inhibitor) and enfuvirtide (a gp41 fusion inhibitor) against calde B and C virus isolates to evaluate possible synergistic effects of the lectin in combination with other microbicides (F\u00e9rir et al., 2011). When GRFT was combined with other microbicides the potency of the combination was higher than that of the individual molecules.",

O'Keefe et al. (2009) used a TMV based vector system for the transient production of GRFT in the cytosol of N. benthamiana leaves. GRFT accumulated to more than 1 g/kg fresh weight and allowed the purification of 60 g GRFT from 226.5 kg processed leaf material.

AH harbours a lot of potential to be developed as an anti-HIV microbicide; the lectin inhibits both T and M tropic HIV strains and is particularly potent against C clade viruses (Chiba et al., 2004, Matoba et al., 2010). Furthermore AH exhibits an impressive safety profile; the lectin did not cause proliferation or mitogenic stimulation on host cells (Hoorelbeke et al., 2010). Unlike other prokaryotic lectins, AH binds to clustered high mannose type glycans instead of single moieties (Chiba et al., 2004, Tanaka et al., 2009). It is thus possible that the cluster binding of AH confers its specificity towards glycan types that are typical of the HIV envelope and is linked to its low mitogenic effects. Matoba et al. (2010) investigated a plant based production system for AH. The native gene (Chiba et al., 2004) was expressed using the Icon vector system. Expression levels between 20 and 120 mg/kg were obtained. When the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) was fused to the N-terminus of AH, the protein levels accumulated to over 200 mg/kg in the apoplast (Davis, 2010). The plant-produced AH was able to inhibit HIV mediated syncytium formation.",

In the case of antibodies, this aspect of expression also influences the glycan structure of the molecule. Also, depending on plant organ, subcellular targeting can influence the overall yield and efficacy of the plant made antibody. Where ER retention of 2G12 in Arabidopsis seed showed no significant difference in expression levels, it resulted in almost twofold lower levels of 2G12 in maize seed. In contrast to maize seed, ER retention of 2G12 in tobacco leaves improved yields. Furthermore ER retention does not seem to be entirely optimal, leaving a small fraction of immunoglobulins that will contain immunogenic plant glycans. Separating these during downstream processing will only add to production costs.",

Furthermore these galactosylated antibodies were more efficacious than the CHO produced equivalent. No mention was made of the accumulation levels of the antibodies in the mutant plant, but the ability to express MAb products with a human glycan profile represents a significant step towards the production in plants of fully functional proteins that are likely to be well tolerated.",

Impurities in the recovered products and glycan structure might play a role in decreasing activity, whilst aggregation and human-like glycan structures appear to improve activity as was the case for MAb 2G12 antibody produced in maize and a modified tobacco.

The AH lectin also accumulated to a good level of 120 mg/kg using the Icon viral vector system.

Any administered HIV microbicide will most likely consist of several compounds with a different mode of action to ensure broad maximum activity without the risk of developing resistance. By producing fusion microbicides one combines the neutralisation potential of two molecules in a single production run, with positive implications for lowering cost and increasing efficacy. Additionally fusions can stabilise the target protein to ensure higher yields, as in the example of ELP fused to anti-HIV antibodies (Floss et al., 2008). Clearly, production of microbicidal candidate molecules offers advantages beyond simple challenges of expression of efficacious molecules.",

Their progress from potential to actual production platform has been facilitated largely by technical developments in vector systems and plant hosts. For a disease such as HIV, where there is a desperate demand for an effective microbicide, these advances could potentially enable plants to meet the supply gap. Although several anti-HIV neutralising antibodies and peptide lectins have been produced in plants, only two have entered clinical trials (Twyman et al., 2012). MAPP66 is a cocktail of several antibodies produced by the magnICON system in N. benthamiana whilst plant-made 2G12 entered clinical trials in 2011 (Twyman et al., 2012). In addition, plant-produced GRFT has passed pre-clinical studies and is considered safe to be evaluated in clinical trials. Advancements in plant-made therapeutics in clinical development and regulatory approval such as the use in advanced broad access trials of carrot cell glucocerebrosidase, provide a new perspective on the potency and utility of PMPs. The hope is that as production and purification technology become more standardised in the field, and as more plant-made candidates progress along the preclinical and clinical developmental pipeline, plants will become a source of routinely used, effective therapeutic and preventative biologics.",
