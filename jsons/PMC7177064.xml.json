Similarly, a recent review in JAMA Otolaryngology discusses the risk of aerosolization associated with the use of powered instruments in mucosal head and neck surgery, and recommends the use of a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), N95 masks, or face shields in patients being evaluated for COVID-19 [4]. The European Society of Surgical Oncology is also taking precautions: advising clinicians to not see patients over 70 years of age in the clinic unless urgent and discouraging surgery for benign diseases [5]. The Australian Society of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery recommends that otolaryngologists use PAPR when performing urgent or emergent cases on COVID-19 positive patients, preferably in designated negative pressure operating rooms [6]. To maintain high standards in cancer care, physicians at the National Cancer Institute of Milan have launched a social media campaign to extend frequent COVID-19 testing to health care workers involved in the treatment of cancer patients [7].",

Those who are awaiting non-curative therapy that is unlikely to offer palliation, tumor control, or an extension of life by more than one year are in the lowest level.

The guidelines propose using a priority classification (A, B, or C) to stratify cancer patients based on need and efficacy of treatment, which will dictate the terms under which they are treated, where they are treated, and when they are treated. For head and neck cancer patients, the ethical responsibility to evaluate and categorize them based on the two aforementioned criteria rests with the surgical oncologist, often in consultation with other providers. Priority A encompasses those who are in critical condition (unstable, unbearable suffering, and/or whose condition is immediately life threatening) and for whom there is effective treatment. These patients require immediate medical attention to initiate or continue treatment. Priority B determines those who are in a non-life threatening state and therefore can have their services deferred without undue risk during a wave of the pandemic event. Priority C determines those who are undergoing routine follow-up or screening and can reasonably wait until the pandemic is over. The priority classification can be employed to determine which patients would most benefit from palliative care symptom management, radiation, surgery, and systemic therapy during a pandemic [12].",

The American Head and Neck Society (AHNS) adds that head and neck surgery will still be indicated in the care of oncologic patients and, to date, no organizations have advocated that cancer care should be delayed. In addition, the AHNS suggests avoiding unnecessary endoscopic exams and discourages the use of nebulizers and atomizers to decrease the risk of transmission through aerosolized particles [18]. To help patients, survivors, and caregivers navigate through the COVID-19 crisis, the Head and Neck Cancer Alliance has disseminated resources to educate them about expected changes in patient care during the pandemic [19].",

The key messages, supported by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), state that radiotherapy should be delivered at the earliest opportunity if the treatment is curative. For head and neck cancer, there is evidence that a 16% increased risk of death exists for every month of delay of radiotherapy [20]. If disease biology permits postponement, then deferring treatment until an expected decline in COVID-19 cases is reasonable. For individuals on active treatment diagnosed with COVID-19, the decision to delay or modify treatment should be individualized based on the overall goals of treatment, the patient\u2019s current oncologic status and medical comorbidities, and treatment tolerance. A risk-benefit analysis is warranted if radiotherapy is offered as an adjunct to prior surgery, as patients who can expect only modest benefit in terms of long-term survival gains may desire to avoid therapy during the pandemic. For patients receiving treatment for palliation, the recommendation is to exhaust all other options, such as maximizing analgesia, prior to pursuing radiotherapy. Furthermore, most patients who have recently completed radiotherapy may have their follow-up appointments safely delayed by two or more months, with telemedicine as needed [21], [22].",

They further issue the following detailed four-tiered stratification defining urgency of some head and neck cases during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) proceed with surgery: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNC), anaplastic or medullary thyroid carcinoma, metastatic or recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), skull base cancer, and some skin cancers 2) consider postponing >30 days: low risk PTC and some skin cancers, 3) consider postponing 30-90 days: routine benign thyroid nodules, revision PTC, basal cell carcinoma with low morbidity 4) case-by-case basis: rare histology with uncertain rate of progression, diagnostic procedures [26]. For COVID-19 positive patients who require urgent or emergent surgery, Stanford recommends all operating room staff to wear PAPR until further data is available. For urgent cases to be performed within 30 days, in which the patients\u2019 COVID-19 status is unknown, pre-operative testing 48 hours prior is also suggested [6].",

Information gathered is updated regularly and available on the AHNS Bulletin Board at https://www.ahns.info/covid-19-info/. Data collected included current COVID-19 burden in the state, PPE practices, perioperative COVID-19 testing, cancer case scheduling concerns, and utilization of residency cadres. To date, 14 institutions have been contributing. All institutions delayed cases that could wait 6-8 weeks, based on surgeon discretion. 86% of institutions had a review process for cancer surgery scheduling, and 4 institutions had suspended transoral robotic surgery. All institutions had significantly limited clinic visits to those considered urgent by the provider, and most had implemented telemedicine visits [29].",

Major concerns with regards to timely pre-operative testing and the delay of results also complicate matters. Some patients are forced into quarantine while they await results - and if negative, until their surgery date to minimize an infection after their testing date. Fortunately, the availability, accuracy, timing and location of pre-operative testing and emerging antibody testing beginning to take shape and will allow for expedient safe care of cancer patients during the pandemic. Further research on this topic of pre-operative testing is ongoing and guidelines are still being created. It is clear however that the most appropriate pre-operative testing strategy will depend on available institutional resources.",
