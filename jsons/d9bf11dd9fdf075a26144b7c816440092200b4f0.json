Hence, reported rates of severe illness conditional on infection are higher than actual rates. Understanding the time path of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative. This paper explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative findings, using data from Illinois, New York, and Italy. We combine the data with assumptions on the infection rate in the untested population and on the accuracy of the tests that appear credible in the current context. We find that the infection rate might be substantially higher than reported. We also find that the infection fatality rate in Italy is substantially lower than reported.",

Confirmed cases have commonly been measured by rates of positive findings among persons who have been tested for infection. Infection data are missing for persons who have not been tested. It is also well-appreciated that the persons who have been tested differ considerably from those who have not been tested. Criteria used to determine who is eligible for testing typically require demonstration of symptoms associated with presence of infection or close contact with infected persons. This gives considerable reason to believe that some fraction of untested persons are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers of the COVID-19 disease. Presuming this is correct, the actual rate of infection has been higher than the reported rate.",

However, if deaths have been recorded accurately and if the actual rate of infection has been higher than the reported rate, the WHO statistic should be interpreted as an upper bound on the actual CFR on that date. Recognizing this, researchers have recommended random testing of populations as a potential future method to solve the missing data problem. 2 In the present absence of random testing, various researchers have put forward point estimates and forecasts for infection rates and rates of severe illness derived in various ways. Work performed by separate groups of epidemiologists at the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team and the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has received considerable public attention. 3 The available estimates and forecasts differ in the assumptions that they use to yield specific values. The assumptions vary substantially and so do the reported findings. To date, no particular assumption or resulting estimate has been thought sufficiently credible as to achieve consensus across researchers.",

We judge the current situation to be intermediate between the worst and best case scenarios. We are aware of no credible way to assign a precise value to P(Cd = 1|Td = 0), nor even to place a tight bound on the quantity.

For example, it has been suggested that the United States can learn from the experience in China, South Korea, and Italy. In these locations the epidemic began earlier and has been handled in different ways. Bringing to bear data from different locations is not helpful per se. It may be helpful if the data are combined with assumptions that enable credible extrapolation across locations. Given such assumptions, the partial-identification sub-literature on intersection bounds shows how to proceed formally to tighten inference. See Manski (2020) and Molinari (2020) .",

We have assumed that hospitals correctly diagnose patients and that public records correctly code causes of death. We caution that these assumptions may not be completely accurate.

In the three locations and on the date mentioned above, the widths of the bounds on the population infection rate are greater than (0.995, 0.983, 0.988). Thus, the available data on the rate of positive tests for tested persons reveal almost nothing about the population infection rate.

Suppose that persons who are accepted for testing all meet the first criterion. Then the rate of infection with symptoms is greater than or equal to the fraction of the population who are both tested and infected. Assume as earlier that all positive testing results are accurate and that the fraction of inaccurate negative testing results is in the bound[Ld10,   Ud10]. Then the fraction who are tested and infected is known to be at least equal to P(Rd = 1) + Ld10P(Td = 1, Rd = 0). Combining this lower bound on P(Sd = 1) with knowledge that \u03b1 \u2265 0.25, (16) yields this lower bound on the population infection rate:(17) P(Cd = 1) \u2265 (0.75) -1 [P(Rd = 1) + Ld10P(Td = 1, Rd = 0)].",

On April 6, 2020, the bounds on the infection rates in Illinois, New York, and Italy respectively are [0.001, 0.517], [0.008, 0.645], and [0.003, 0.510].We next exemplify how bringing to bear further information from expert opinion, specifically that of Anthony Fauci discussed in Section 2.3, may tighten the bounds.

Focusing on April 6, 2020, we see that the bound on the probability of beinghospitalized if infected is [0.001, 0.172]. The bound on the probability of needing intensive care is narrow, being [0, 0.02]. The fatality rate on April 6 lies in the bound [0.001, 0.086].
