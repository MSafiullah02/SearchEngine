All sub-Saharan African regions are highly biodiverse with large rural populations that are highly dependent on livestock agriculture. Movement of pathogens between animals and people increases as the domestic populations expand, creating novel ecotones and ecosystemic perturbation. With increasing food security demands, intensification of livestock and agriculture is required and further evolution and spill over of novel zoonoses to humans is inevitable. The emergence this century of previously unknown zoonotic respiratory tract infectious diseases with epidemic potential,3 such as Avian influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), highlights an urgent need to change the current global status quo.4 The 2015 west African Ebola virus epidemic5 illustrated that once an infectious disease takes hold locally, the originating region and rest of the world is put at equal risk due to ease of international travel, global food systems, livestock trade, and inadequate capacities to identify and respond to outbreaks.",

            "text": "Several lessons were learnt from the Ebola virus outbreak that could help guide development of more effective and appropriate response capacities. Much of the spread and devastating impact of Ebola virus in west Africa was rooted in the emerging environmental, socioeconomic, and socio-anthropological changes taking place in west Africa. The highly medicalised approach and ineffectiveness of the local and regional surveillance mechanisms delayed appropriate socioecological management of the epidemic.6, 7 Absent were effective active disease surveillance, early diagnosis using rapid diagnostic tests, rapid communication of data for health systems, and engagement and awareness of communities,6, 7, 8 to implement intervention measures to control spread. Behavioural factors also contributed to rapid outbreak spread. Improved understanding of eco-epidemiological, socio-cultural, anthropological, and political determinants that drive the emergence and spread of disease is crucial to preventing epidemics. Furthermore, the lack of local capacity and preparedness in affected west African countries to conduct comprehensive, multidisciplinary and well-coordinated research was also evident during the Ebola virus epidemic. Foreign aid workers and research groups aroused local anxieties among communities8 due to ignorance of, or insensitivity to, cultural norms. Research studies to assess and determine optimal management protocols and trial new treatments and vaccines were slow to start,9 and were dominated by foreign groups, with scant involvement of African scientists or local policy makers. Newer treatments in development and those with compassionate-use regulations were available but their use and evaluation to inform optimal evidence-based management, were slowed down by the absence of rapid ethical review processes for research in emergency situations.",

Although antibiotic resistant bacteria have spread globally due to increased travel and population movement, the scale of the problem of antimicrobial resistance in Africa remains largely undefined.

Such a partnership would ensure the readiness to immediately perform coordinated basic science research, to define the source of outbreak and transmission dynamics, and to conduct large-scale multisite clinical studies. It will enable establishment of regional high quality laboratories incorporating rapid diagnostics for multiple pathogens, and proactive surveillance systems providing latest real-time information.12 Replication of the mobile laboratory model in all African regions will also enable to take forward the important agenda of establishing effective rapid response teams for outbreaks with support of national governments and public health services.",
