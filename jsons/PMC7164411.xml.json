In the context of the recent devastating bushfires in Australia and the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, recognising and protecting those affected has magnified the impact and public health importance of frailty. Effects of frailty include bodily deterioration and the failure of physiological systems to cope with changes in the environment (2). Frailty prevalence is around 9\u201317% in community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and over (1) and renders an older adult at heightened risk of adverse outcomes such as infections, hospitalisation, pre-mature admission to care facilities, and mortality (2, 3). Although the physiological and functional decline that occurs with frailty usually occurs gradually over a number of years, this functional decline can occur rapidly when external stressors are present (2).",

Over millennia, humans have adapted to survive relatively harsh climates, both by genetic adaptation and through the use of housing, clothing, and heating/cooling technologies (4). This ability to optimise thermoregulatory control has rendered humans as \u2018seasonality flexible\u2019, in that they can survive and adapt to seasonal variations in the environment in nearly every corner of the globe (4, 5). However, such protection is not universal and degrades with age, deconditioning and chronic disease (5\u20137). As recently described (4, 8), seasonality in the form of predictable/cyclic changes in climatic conditions (including changing ambient temperatures and humidity levels plus daylight exposure level) is a major driver of morbidity and mortality at the individual level in susceptible individuals; contributing to 10\u201320% variations in cardiovascular-related events throughout the year (4, 8). When combined with associated changes in pollution levels and exposure to infectious disease such as seasonal flu, seasonality involves external stressors which can negatively impact older people with frailty.",

It is also thought that the physiological ability to regulate temperature declines with frailty, given that this is also a common occurrence with the \u2018ageing process\u2019 (14, 15). Indeed, the majority of older people require higher temperatures to be within their thermal comfort zone (14, 15).",

For instance, frailty is often linked with poverty (17), and in turn, a recent Australian study found that older people with frailty were very likely to be saving heating costs in winter by turning off heating appliances (18). A lack of heating means indoor temperatures are too low, with the authors of this study concluding that this practice may very well be leading to unintended health risks for older people with frailty (18). Similarly a recent cross-sectional study from Japan reported that older adults who were both financially stressed and feeling cold during winter peaks were significantly more likely to be frail (19). One interesting study reported that perceived indoor temperature is perhaps more important than ambient room temperature (18). Notable is that in those older adults with reported colder homes, only those with lower reported socioeconomic status had an increased likelihood of being frail (20). A lack of cultural and behavioural resilience to relatively cold weather, as opposed to that developed in harsher climates elsewhere in the world (21), undoubtedly exacerbates this issue in otherwise milder climates.",

Physical performance is also lower in older adults in colder houses during winter (25). Of significance, a recent study of older rural-dwelling older adults in Japan reported that the number of daily steps and the time spent in low-intensity activity (particularly outdoor gardening) dropped off during winter peaks/snowy conditions \u2014 however, the time spent in moderate to high intensity physical activity was not influenced by seasonal fluctuations (26) Lower limb resistance-based exercises may be a way to combat this physical activity drop in this population group, based on the promising results of a recent RCT (27).",

Recently, a model of \u2018seasonal flexibility\u2019 has been developed which identifies physical phenotypes of resilience in patients affected by cardiovascular disease (8) and, more specifically, the syndrome of heart failure (4). This model could potentially be extrapolated out to older people with frailty. Future research would be wise to test this model\u2019s applicability to older people with frailty. It may even be that some older adults with frailty have factors which protect them from adverse outcomes. For instance, higher socioeconomic status seems to be one protective factor, based on the above-mentioned studies linking frailty, cold and poverty (19). A good support network and lack of loneliness (thereby avoiding social frailty) may also play a protective role against seasonal fluctuations, although this link is currently subjective with a lack of research into the topic.",

One such policy in existence is New Zealand\u2019s financial support for older adults towards winter heating costs. Whether this policy helps to prevent/reduce frailty in older adults remains to be investigated. Other potential strategies include public health campaigns targeting older adults ahead of winter flu season \u2014 for instance, flu vaccination and proactively identifying individuals with frailty in the primary care setting. In countries such as Australia, there is also the potential for primary care to keep registers of older adults with frailty and/or vulnerability which could be rapidly activated in the case of bushfires and other emergencies. These emergency warning systems could be linked to mobile phones to quickly check if older people are coping ahead of seasonal fluctuations and climatic events.",
