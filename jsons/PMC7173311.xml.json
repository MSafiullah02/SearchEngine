            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the etiological agent of a highly contagious disease of chickens known as infectious bronchitis, but the virus can replicate in epithelial cells of different organs, also affecting the urogenital or digestive tracts beside the respiratory tract (Cavanagh, 2005, Cavanagh, 2007). Together with genetically similar viruses isolated from other domesticated Galliformes, IBV belongs to the Igacovirus subgenus within the Gammacoronavirus genus (Nidovirales order, Cornidovirinae suborder, Coronaviridae family, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily). The non-avian SW1 gammacoronavirus isolated from beluga whales was recently assigned to the separate Cegacovirus subgenus (Dong et al., 2007; King et al., 2018). The virus genome is an approximately 27 kb long single-stranded, positive-sense RNA consisting of several open reading frames (ORFs). Two thirds of the genome in the 5\u2032 end are occupied by two overlapping ORFs encoding viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The 1a and 1b ORFs encode 15 non-structural polypeptides (nsp2\u201316) which are associated with RNA replication and transcription. In the 3\u2032 end are genes that among other products encode the four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits of about 534 and 627 amino acids during viral maturation. The S2 subunit anchors the spike into the virus membrane whereas S1 forms the extracellular part of the spike and plays a major role in tissue tropism and induction of protective immunity (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008).",

            "text": "IBV undergoes many genetic changes generated both by recombinations and mutations such as substitutions, deletions and insertions, which could lead to the emergence of new variants. Among factors that create favorable conditions for such events are characteristic features of coronaviruses in the genome structure (large single-stranded RNA) and virus biology (minimal proofreading activity of viral polymerase) and modern poultry-rearing habits and immunological pressure caused by the worldwide use of vaccines (Ovchinnikova et al., 2011; Woo et al., 2009). Mutations within the S1 gene particularly result in new geno- or serotypes, and currently there are many such types around the world (de Wit et al., 2011). Their number, diversity and naming and the plurality of methods used for their determination for years have caused much confusion. To avoid it, new classification rules based on the whole S1 gene phylogeny (about 1600 nt) and new nomenclature have been proposed. This system distinguished and named 32 lineages, aggregating into 6 genotypes (GI to GVI) (Valastro et al., 2016). However, in the last three years, two more lineages (GI-28 and 29) and even one more genotype (GVII) have been described in China (Chen et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019).",

            "text": "In Poland, the first suspicion of IB was based on clinical observations, as respiratory symptoms incurable with antibiotics in some flocks and/or misshapen eggs from commercial flocks came to notice. Laboratory confirmation of IBV infection was obtained at the end of the 1960s. Between 1964 and 1965, 4165 sera from two hundred ten chicken flocks at the age of 6\u201318 months were examined in an agar gel precipitation test and only 13% of them were positive although 79% of flocks contained birds with positive serum (Karczewski and Cakala, 1967). Outbreaks of IB with respiratory signs and a drop in egg production and egg quality in non-vaccinated breeding and particularly laying chicken flocks were recorded in the mid-1980s (Bugajak et al., 1997). Since the mid-1990s, outbreaks of IB-nephritis have been reported in broiler flocks (Minta et al., 2000). A multiplex-PCR testing strains isolated between 1997 and 1998 revealed that the most of them belonged to the 793B type (Capua et al., 1999). The emergence of QX IBV was detected in 2004 (Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2006; Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2007). More recently, the next variant of IBV called Var2 which had been circulating only in the Middle-East region for the previous 20 years was also detected in Poland (Lisowska et al., 2017).",

Various combinations of primer pairs described recently as well as additional primers specifically constructed for some strains (Appendix A Supplementary material) were applied for amplification and sequencing of the whole S1 coding region (Binns et al., 1986; Boursnell et al., 1987; Dolz et al., 2006, Dolz et al., 2008; Lisowska et al., 2017; Worthington et al., 2008). The reactions were run according to the recommended protocol for the kit with different annealing temperatures depending on the melting temperature of the primer pair used. Amplified PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and then purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Typically, for the S1 coding region of Polish IBV strains, 3\u20137 PCR products were sequenced in both directions using Sanger sequencing technology by Genomed (Warsaw, Poland). The complete genomes of these IBV strains were generated using Illumina MiSeq technology (Illumina, San Diego, USA) in several laboratories. The five IBV strains 78/1989, 79/1989, 548/2004, G195/2012 and G103/2016 were processed in the Department of Microbiology of the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (SVA, Uppsala, Sweden), four subsequent virus strains 80/1989, 162/1997, 255/1997 and G225/2017 were analyzed in the Department of Omics Analysis in our institute, and one IBV strain G074/2009 was sequenced by Genomed (Warsaw, Poland). Analyses in these organizations were made according to the standard procedure. Briefly, RNA extracted directly from the allantoid fluid was retrotranscribed into DNA using a Superscript IV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Waltham, USA) and the second strand was synthesized with the addition of Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA). A 300 bp-long paired-end DNA library was prepared using a Nextera XT sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) and sequencing was performed using a MiSeq Reagent kit v3 (Illumina, San Diego, USA).",

Sequences of Polish viruses were searched with BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to find these ones with the highest similarity and include them in the phylogenetic analyses. Then the full S1 sequences were aligned with 199 sequences representing 32 lineages in their 6 IBV genotype groupings and 26 unique variants as Valastro et al. recommended (Valastro et al., 2016) using Clustal W. Additionally, eight sequences representing the two newly identified GI-28 and GI-29 lineages and one GVII-1 genotype were included in the analysis. Sequencing data from MiSeq technology obtained from the SVA (Uppsala, Sweden) and Genomed were processed with the CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The reads obtained in the Department of Omics Analysis of our Institute were assembled into contigs with the SPAdes assembler using the website at http://spades.bioinf.spbau.ru (Bankevich et al., 2012). For phylogeny of the complete genomes of the Polish IBV strains, a preliminary analysis was carried out using all 362 gammacoronaviruses available in the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) through the website at http://www.viprbrc.org/ (Pickett et al., 2012). Next, 56 strains were selected for further analysis, taking into account their clustering in the ViPR analysis. Alignments of nucleotide sequences were performed using the multiple alignment using fast Fourier transform (MAFFT) method in Geneious software, v11.1.3 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). The alignments were then exported to the MEGA program, v7.0.26 (Tamura et al., 2013). Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses of the S1 coding region and of the complete genome were then conducted using the best-fitting nucleotide substitution models (the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores in each analysis were for the general time reversible (GTR) model and a discrete gamma distribution (+G) with five rate categories, assuming that a certain fraction of sites are evolutionarily invariable (G + I)). Bootstrap analyses of the resultant trees were performed using 1000 replicates.",

We investigated the S1 coding region of 34 IBV strains and the whole genome of ten strains. Polish IBV strains showed different molecular features of the S1 coding region allowing their genotype or lineage to be determined, and their appearance in time reflects the history of IBV epidemics in Europe (de Wit et al., 2011). The plot showing the timeline of various IBV lineages's detection and introduction of different vaccines to poultry population in Poland is given in Fig. 4\n. The first identified IBV isolates in Europe belonged to the Mass type. In the Netherlands they were diagnosed in the middle of the 1950s and one of them was even attenuated for vaccine development purposes (Bijlenga et al., 2004). The first IBV material available in our laboratory originates from 1980 and its S1 sequence displayed the features of GI-1 lineage, although no information was provided about the disease symptoms observed in the chicken flock where it was identified. Later on, especially in the middle of the 1980s, numerous cases of a drop in egg production were recorded. The problem was so serious that Polish veterinary authorities decided to allow the first IB vaccine introduction, but only for immunization of commercial layer flocks. The health problems in layers were significantly mitigated, but at the end of the 1980s respiratory problems and mortality manifested in broiler chicken flocks, and so the vaccination of chickens of this production type was also started (Minta et al., 1990). We thoroughly examined four virus strains from that time, 78/1989, 79/1989, 80/1989 and 81/1989. Two of them, strains 78/1989 and 79/1989, have the S1 structure typical of the GI-1 lineage. Similarly, their entire genomes revealed the highest identity to Mass-like strains such as H120 or Beaudette. These two viruses came from broiler chickens on farms in the Silesia region separated by only a few kilometers. The two other viruses, 80/1989 and 81/1989, were identified in broilers delivered to the laboratory near the same period (in June 1989) but from farms about 30 km from the previous ones. However, our investigation revealed a distinction between them. Phylogenetic analysis of the full S1 coding region showed that strain 80/1989 forms a separate branch on the tree designated as early Polish and was classified as a unique variant of IBV within the GI genotype. Deep analysis of the 81/1989 strain strongly suggests that its S1 coding region was created as the result of a recombination event between the Mass-like strains and the unique early Polish variants circulating in the field at that time. It should be emphasized that the identified recombination breakpoint (651 nt) was in the intermediate region between highly variable regions (HVRs) 1 and 2 and HVR3 previously described as the most frequent locations of variations between IB viruses, and moreover, it exactly matches the breakpoint (550 and 652 nt) of recombinants between viruses of GI-19 and GI-22 lineages (Valastro et al., 2016).",

            "text": "The introduction of vaccines based on the Mass-like strains for chicken immunization significantly reduced the economic losses caused by IB. This state of IB control lasted for about 10 years until 1997, when IB disease inducing kidney damage appeared, caused by 793B-like IBV strains. The first case of nephritis was in 3-week-old broilers in the south of Poland. The birds showed signs of severe enteritis and the observed gross lesions were congested tracheas and lungs and swollen and pale kidneys with the presence of urine. In subsequent months, further broilers with nephritis were provided for diagnostic purposes and the diseased flocks from which they came were located in all regions of Poland; most of them had not been vaccinated against IB, but some had been immunized with Mass-like vaccine in the first days of life. The strains identified at that time, 255/1997 and 58/1998, have an S1 sequence similar to IBV strains of GI-13 lineage. Surprisingly, one of the first isolates known to cause nephritis, strain 162/1997 together with strain 80/1989 inflicting respiratory disorders, were located in the early Polish branch of the phylogenetic tree with well supported uniformity to others (bootstrap value of 74) (Hillis and Bull, 1993). The next Polish GI-13 strains identified between 2004 and 2015 revealed the highest nt similarity to the S1 sequence of the 4/91 strain contained in the most commonly used vaccine in Poland at that time (Adzhar et al., 1997).",

The first report of disease induced by this virus type was published in 2006, but our studies showed the presence of the virus in Poland in 2004 (Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2006). It was from this year that QX strains were first identified in Holland, Germany, Belgium and France, and next year they became dominant in some of these countries (Worthington et al., 2008). The analysis of the migration history of GI-19 strains suggests that most European ones came from a single introduction from China, which then spread in European countries, evolving in them separately, since they tend to cluster by country. However, the genetic variability of GI-19 IBVs sometimes identified within countries suggests subsequent introduction of the virus in epidemic waves (Franzo et al., 2017). The division of Polish GI-19 strains into four clusters could reflect a separate introduction or epidemic wave of this virus variant into the country.",

During this period, strains of other genotypes and lineages also circulated in the field but their detection or type determination was not possible using available methods. The comprehensive studies of Polish IBV isolates from 1998 to 1999 using serological and molecular tests conducted in cooperation with Italian researchers showed that the 793B type was a major component of the IBV population in Poland during this period, but serologically the presence of 624/I isolates was also identified and one isolate even showed no serological cross-reaction in an HI test nor amplification in RT-PCR (Capua et al., 1999). Recently, the 624/I and Q1 types were determined to affiliate to the GI-16 lineage, which has been present in Europe (Italy) since 1963 and persists until now (Franzo et al., 2018). In the period 2011\u20132013 numerous cases of D1466 IBV (GII-1 lineage) were detected, however, in subsequent years (2014\u20132015), the number of D1466-positive samples dropped to 3.1%, and currently we do not detect these viruses at all (Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2012; Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2017).",

            "text": "The complete genome sequences of all Polish field IBV strains showed the presence of six genes and 13 ORFs in the order previously reported, irrespective of the year of first isolation (Abolnik, 2015; Gomaa et al., 2008; Hewson et al., 2011). Most accessory proteins are conservative in their lengths, in contrast to the structural ones which differ by even as much as 35 aa (M protein of GI-13/23 and GI-19). An interesting observation is clustering of Polish IBVs based on the complete genome sequences. The earliest strains 78/1989 and 79/1989 belonging to the GI-1 lineage cluster with other representatives of this lineage such as the Beaudette and Dutch H120 strains, which could indicate the common origin of Mass-like viruses. The viruses from the next epidemic wave are 162/1997 and 255/1997, and they were on the separate branch of the phylogenetic tree together with the strain 80/1989. The 80/1989 virus was located on the S1 coding region phylogenetic tree with the 162/1997 strain in the separate IBV branch of early Polish IBV. On the other hand, the third virus of this separate group, 255/97, found its place in the GI-13 lineage on the phylogenic tree based on the S1 coding region. Thorough analysis using RDP4 software revealed that the S gene of this virus was acquired from IBV strains of GI-13 lineage during a recombination event. The results suggest that in the late 1980s and 1990s two IBV variants circulated in the Polish poultry population: GI-1 and unique early Polish ones. These viruses differ not only in the S1 coding region, which is the basis for the differentiation of lineages, but also in the remaining part of the genome. The viruses with such a genome backbone recombined with other viruses that were donors of the S1 coding region. Grouping on a phylogenetic tree based on the complete genome of the other five Polish strains was as expected. Three G-19 strains, 548/2004, G074/2009 and G195/2012, took positions among other QX-like viruses from Europe (Sweden and Italy) and Africa (South Africa and Sudan) (Abolnik, 2015; Abro et al., 2012; Ducatez et al., 2009; Naguib et al., 2016). In turn, two strains of GI-23 lineage, the viruses G103/2016 and G225/2017, were in the branch with the previously characterized Polish G052/2016 and Iranian IS-1494 strains of GI-23 lineage isolated in 2015. It seems that in Poland in the 1980s and 1990s IBV strains with a unique genome backbone circulated in the field, which were then replaced by strains belonging to other IBV lineages with a genome backbone specific to these lineages. In addition to the aforementioned recombination, five such events were also identified in Polish IBV strains. Three strains of the GI-19 lineage had ORF1a and ORF1b which revealed a high frequency of recombination events with 4/91 and SDZB0808-like strains (QX type strains from China from 2008). Two strains of the GI-23 lineage exhibited recombination with the Italy/90254/2005-type IBV, and a similar recombination pattern was also previously indicated (Lisowska et al., 2017).",

Additionally, two strains formed a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree described as unique early Polish variants and one strain revealed itself to be the recombinant of GI-1 lineage viruses and these unique early Polish variants. The phylogenetic analyses performed on the complete genome of ten Polish IBV strains showed that they cluster into different groups. Polish GI-1, GI-19 and GI-23 strains cluster with other similar viruses of these lineages, with the exception of the strains from 1989 to 1997 which are different. The recombination analysis showed that Polish strains are a mosaic of different parental viruses most likely resulting from recombination events involving different IBV lineages, most frequently GI-13 and GI-19. It should be also stressed that the major epidemics of IB in Poland appeared every 8\u201311 years: GI-1 in 1988, GI-13 in 1997, GI-19 in 2004 and GI-23 in 2015. These subsequent IBV lineages could have reached chickens in Poland in various ways: carried by wild birds, or as a result of international trade, including uncontrolled movement of animals across borders (Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2014; Hussein et al., 2014; Kahya et al., 2013). Despite the apparent regularity in the appearance of subsequent IB epidemics, it is absolutely impossible to predict when the next one will appear. The most important impediment to prediction are the visible climate changes forcing changes in bird behavior, but another is the extraordinary intensification of the poultry industry in Poland.",
