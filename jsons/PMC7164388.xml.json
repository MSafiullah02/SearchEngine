Another standard strategy that Chinese authorities applied was contact\ntracing (17), where possible\ntransmission chains between known infecteds and their contacts were identified and suspected\ncases were isolated at home before symptom onset. While very effective in interrupting the\ntransmission process and thereby shielding large numbers of susceptibles from acquiring the\ninfection, contact tracing becomes infeasible when the number of infected grows rapidly in a\nshort amount of time or when an undetected outbreak leads to a large number of\nunidentifiable infecteds, as was the case in Hubei.",

A simple reduction of contacts caused by\nquarantine policies without additional shielding of susceptibles could be associated with a\nreduction in the effective reproduction number, which would, however, still yield an\nexponential growth in I(t) if R0>1, inconsistent with the observed transient scaling law\nt\u03bc discussed above. To test the hypothesis that the observed\ngrowth behavior can be caused by mitigation policies that apply to both, infected and\nsusceptible individuals, we extend the SIR model by two additional mechanisms one of which\ncan be interpreted as a process of removing susceptibles from the transmission process:\nFirst, we assume that general public containment efforts or individual behavioral changes in\nresponse to the epidemic effectively remove individuals from the interaction dynamics or\nsignificantly reduce their participation in the transmission dynamics. We will refer to this\nmechanism as \u2018containment\u2018 in the following. Secondly, we account for the\nremoval of symptomatic infected individuals, which we will refer to as\n\u2018quarantine\u2018 procedures. The dynamics are governed by the system of ordinary\ndifferential equations:\u2202tS=\u2212\u03b1SI\u2212\u03ba0S(1)\n\u2202tI=\u03b1SI\u2212\u03b2I\u2212\u03ba0I\u2212\u03baI(2)\n\u2202tR=\u03b2I+\u03ba0S(3)\n\u2202tX=(\u03ba+\u03ba0)I,(4)a generalization of the standard SIR model,\nhenceforth referred to as the SIR-X model. The rate parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 quantify the transmission rate and the recovery rate of the\nstandard SIR model, respectively. Additionally, the impact of containment efforts is\ncaptured by the terms proportional to the containment rate \u03ba0 that is effective in both I and S populations, since measures like social distancing and\ncurfews affect the whole population alike. Infected individuals are removed at rate\n\u03ba corresponding to quarantine measures that only affect\nsymptomatic infecteds. The new compartment X quantifies symptomatic, quarantined infecteds. Here we assume\nthat the fraction X(t) is proportional to the empirically confirmed and reported\ncases C(t) and that the time period between sampling and test results\ncan be neglected. The case \u03ba0=0 corresponds to a scenario in which the general population is\nunaffected by policies or does not commit behavioral changes in response to an epidemic. The\ncase \u03ba=0 corresponds to a scenario in which symptomatic infecteds are\nnot isolated specifically.",

While the explicit shape of the growth curves discussed here\ncan be influenced by factors such as seasonal effects, systematic delay in reporting, or\nheterogeneities in demographic structure and population mixing, the fact that total case\nnumbers eventually reached a stable value suggests that containment strategies that shielded\nthe susceptible population from the transmission process were rather\neffective\u2014compared to potential case numbers of an unmitigated outbreak, only a small\nfraction of the Chinese population that was at risk has been infected up to date (Mar.\n29th).
