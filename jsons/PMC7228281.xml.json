The overall purpose is to keep populations informed and safe. In order to do so, public health strategies directed at the community level, nationally, or internationally, sometimes require restricting any one individual\u2019s rights to freedom of movement and association, for example, using measures such as quarantine in the interest of the greater population.\n1\n Nevertheless, during epidemics it is crucial to monitor the implementation of public health strategies with conscious attention to human rights, especially of those individuals living with a disability.\n2\n\n",

Moreover, the World Health Organization\u2019s report on disability showed that over 1 billion of the world's population (15%) live with some form of disability, of whom 2% to 4% experience significant difficulties in functioning.\n3\n This shows the importance of establishing links between disability and health emergencies and the need for action on inclusion.",

Lack of inclusive humanitarian response, neglect, and separation from family members are common ways of violation of rights of these children.\n4\n In light of the ongoing COVID\u201019 pandemic, it is important to raise awareness of the individual and collective human rights to equally access services and ensure that all people are treated with dignity and respect.",

Therefore, it is essential to have a significantly stronger and more effective approach for global surveillance for major pandemic and epidemic infectious disease risks. The same applies to a human rights approach for humanitarian responses. Having rights\u2010based strategies and tools in place before the events happen is key for an inclusive response. I want to point out that there are useful tools available guiding an inclusive community\u2010based response during crises that can be used both in planning and implementation\n5\n (see https://www.who.int/emergencies/outbreak-toolkit/disease-outbreak-toolboxes and https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/managing-epidemics-interactive.pdf). Most importantly, to make successful inclusive community\u2010based responses we need to ensure that persons with disabilities have roles and responsibilities in the design and implementation of the plans.",
