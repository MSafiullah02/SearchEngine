Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk for acquiring emerging infection while caring for patients. Among 186 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the 2015 outbreak in South Korea, 39 (21.0%) were HCWs who were exposed to MERS-CoV at 12 healthcare facilities [2]. Thirty (83.3%) HCWs were infected with MERS-CoV during the course of their treatment without knowing whether the patient was infected with MERS-CoV [2]. There is no approved post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) therapy for the prevention of MERS-CoV infection. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of PEP therapy for HCWs exposed to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia. Safety of the PEP regimen was also evaluated.",

At the time of admission, the patient had pneumonia with fever lasting 10 days. Two days later, patient A was transferred to intensive care unit where she received endotracheal intubation. Since a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was not suspected during this period, HCWs did not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). As no specific pathogen was identified, testing for MERS-CoV infection was conducted. Real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (rRT\u2013PCR) was strongly positive for MERS-CoV [3]. Patient A had cycle threshold (CT) values of 17.9 for envelope protein gene and 18.2 for open reading frame 1a gene. After patient A had been diagnosed with MERS-CoV, rapid contact tracing was performed and possible contact exposures were divided into two groups: high-risk and non-high-risk exposure groups. HCWs with high-risk exposure were isolated and immediately offered oral ribavirin (Viramid capsules; Ilsung Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, South Korea) and lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra; Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA). The PEP protocol was initiated between days 1 and 3 after the last unprotected exposure to patient A. PEP therapy was administered until day 14 after the last exposure according to the incubation period of the disease [1]. Ribavirin was administered orally at a loading dose of 2000 mg followed by 1200 mg every 8 h for 4 days and then 600 mg every 8 h for 6\u20138 days. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg/100 mg every 12 h for 11\u201313 days. Laboratory testing for HCWs in the PEP group was performed on days 3, 7, and 11 after treatment initiation. HCWs who received PEP therapy also underwent two-point sputum screening with MERS-CoV rRT\u2013PCR. To improve detection of unrecognized MERS-CoV infection in the PEP group, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) was also performed to detect MERS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) after completion of PEP therapy [4].",

Pre-isolation pneumonia patients visited participating hospitals without knowing that they were infected with MERS-CoV. CT data were available for all five MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia patients. CT values of the five patients were similar. HCWs with unprotected exposure to patients with MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia were enrolled from the above five hospitals between May and July 2015. We only included HCWs with high-risk exposure. HCWs from hospital A treated with PEP represented the PEP group. HCWs from other hospitals who did not receive PEP were classified as the non-PEP group. HCWs in the non-PEP group were isolated and monitored for the development of MERS-like symptoms for 14 days from the date of exposure to a patient with MERS. The incidence of MERS-CoV infection was compared between these groups.",

We defined the following as aerosol-generating procedures: airway suction, application of a high-flow O2 instrument, bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, nebulizer treatment, sputum induction, positive pressure ventilation, manual ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
