In two cohort studies of 205 and 40 patients, the presence of plasma viral RNA was detected in only 1% and 15% of patients, respectively [5,6]. Finally, German researchers recently reported the failure to isolate infectious viruses from the blood of infected patients [7]. The use of more sensitive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests such as like a recently described assay that detected positive viremia in 11/80 samples from 15 previously negative (0/80) patients should increase the detection rate of the virus in blood as was observed in nasopharyngeal samples [8]. This new test allowed to establish in vitro the relationship between infectious virus and number of copies that is now estimated to be 1.8 TCID50 (approximately 4 infectious particles for 11 copies (95% confidence interval: 7.2-52.6 copies). A very recent submitted article shown that in a cohort of 50 COVID patient, but 78% male, the detection of viremia, using the WHO RT-qPCR protocol, rise significantly from 60% to 88% according to the severity of the disease. [9] In this article, the median of plasma viral load was from 100 to 500 copies/mL respectively. However, one patient shown viral load upper than 104 copies/mL. These plasma viral load data will be invaluable in assessing the risk of in utero virus transmission when the test becomes available and can be applied to pregnant women blood samples.",

Another study failed to demonstrate viral production following direct infection of blood monocytes with high infectious doses of SARS-CoV-2 virus (MOI 10, i.e. 10 infectious particles / cells) ([12], [11]). Conversely, the authors described a gradual decrease in the intracellular amount of RNA over time. These results should however be put into perspective if we consider the experience of Chikungunya for which there is no infection of PBMC in vitro but for which we have been able to repeatedly show the transient presence in monocytes and lymphocytes B in the blood of patients and during ex vivo infection of whole blood in humans, as well as in the macaque model. [13] These data suggest that the frequency and titers of RNAemia in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients may be lower or at most equivalent to that seen in SARS-CoV-1 infected patients. In addition, the virus does not seem capable of developing a productive infection in the circulating monocytes, or at a very low level, in line with previous observations on SARS-CoV-1 [14]. These results remain to be confirmed once the detection tests in plasma have been optimized.",

To date, breast milk has been analyzed in 26 cases, without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 ([17]; [19,31]; [33,35]; [36]).

However, whether this is evidence of in utero transmission has been disputed [38]. The sensitivity / specificity of IgM detection would be 88.2% / 96.2% and 70.2% / 99% according to these same studies and thus much higher than that observed for other viral infections. Furthermore, none of this children had a positive RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal samples [30,31] nor in the blood [30]. In addition, the decrease in IgM is very rapid in the Dong L study, going from 45.83 AU / mL to 2 hours of life compared to 11.75 AU / mL on the 14th day of life (for a positivity threshold of 10 AU / mL), which seems surprising in the case of a congenital infection",

In the perinatal period, maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection can have harmful consequences on obstetric outcomes and on newborns, resulting in particular in respiratory distress, biological abnormalities, premature deliveries and even fetal death in utero [39].

According to these data, the transmission risk is probably very low, possibly under 1% following maternal SARS-CoV-1 infection during pregnancy. The available studies concerned patients infected at the end of pregnancy, and in these studies, it should be noted that the time between maternal infection and delivery was often very short (of the order of a few days), which may not be sufficient for transplacental passage to occur.",
