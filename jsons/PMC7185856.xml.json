            "text": "Disease-induced death has accounted for a quarter of all deaths in the world annually, most of which happens in low- and middle-income countries  [1]. Diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and flu present some distinct characteristics, including rapid spatial spread and visible symptoms. Once an infectious disease appears and spreads in a region, the disease control and prevention center will do its best to stop the propagation of the disease. One of the measures is to tell people the appropriate preventive knowledge of the disease as soon as possible through media (broadcasts, television, news, and so on) and education  [2]. In practice, if residents have more preventive knowledge, the better they are able to protect themselves by adopting necessary measures. For example, during outbreaks of serious infectious diseases such as the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, public media had massive reports on the number of infections and deaths per day, the locations where they happened, the symptoms of the disease, proper protection to reduce the possibility of being infected, etc.  [3]. Therefore, it is important to refine classical mathematical models to cover these features by adding the dimensions of massive news coverage that may have an impact not only on individual behavior but also on the formation and implementation of public intervention and control policies  [4], [5].",

For example, a survey found that three tabloids and two broadsheets ran a total of 1153 news stories involving severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Britain from March to July 2003  [10], while the New Zealand Herald ran 261 articles from 13 March 2003 to 11 June 2003  [11] during the spread of SARS. On the one hand, as the number of infected cases increases, the media coverage may give more reports (maybe the number of infections and deaths per day, the locations where these happen, the symptoms of the disease) about them, while on the other hand, it can certainly cut down the opportunity and probability of contact transmission among the alerted susceptible populations, which is beneficial to the control and prevention of disease for further spreading. Many compartmental models  [2], [6], [7], [8], [5], [12] have assumed that media coverage could reduce the contact rate between susceptibles and infectives.",

A few models have used network-based or individual-based approaches by adding the dimensions of massive news coverage. In fact, the spread of an infectious diseases in a population depends not only on the pathology of the disease itself, but also on the structure and mix patterns of the population. There are extensive investigations on overcoming this shortcoming, and one important effort along this direction is the use of complex network models, since the spread mechanism of diseases on networks has been widely studied by many researchers  [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24].

Statistically speaking, p(k) is the probability that a vertex chosen randomly has degree k   [25]. Various studies  [26], [25], [27] have revealed that the degree distribution p(k) of most real-world networks is highly skewed, and that it usually follows a power law p(k)\u223ck\u2212\u03b3   [28]. Pastor-Satorras et al.  [29] found that there was a nonzero epidemic threshold \u03bbc in a homogeneous network as the classical prediction  [30], and a surprising absence of any epidemic threshold or \u03bbc=0 in the heterogeneous counterpart if 2<\u03b3\u22643 and if the network size approaches infinity. This surprising result gave a good explanation to the behavior of a long-standing computer virus in computer networks  [16]. For finite size scale-free networks, Pastor-Satorras et al.  [19] introduced a maximum degree kc that came to a nonzero threshold, but when kc increased or the network size approached infinity, \u03bbc would still approach zero. However, Zhou et al.  [22] considered the fact that in reality the hub nodes might be only able to contact a limited population at one period of time despite their wide acquaintance, and proposed an epidemic model with identical infectivity for each infected individual which came to a constant threshold \u03bbc independent of the degree distributions and the network size.",

When disease transmission is modeled on networks, individuals are treated as nodes, and potential contacts among individuals as edges. To address the heterogeneity in the contacts among individuals, the population is divided into n distinct groups of size Nk(k=1,2,\u2026,n) such that each individual in group k has exactly k contacts; here, n denotes the maximum degree of all nodes. If the whole population size is N(N=N1+N2+\u22ef+Nn), then the degree distribution is p(k)=Nk/N according to the previous section. The value \u3008k\u3009=\u2211kkp(k) is the average number of contacts each node (individual) can make. In epidemiology, there are two important and fundamental epidemic models: SIS and SIR  [30]. For the SIS model, each individual can be in two states: S, susceptible to the disease, and I, infectious individuals who can transmit the disease to the susceptible one. A susceptible individual may get infected at rate \u03b2 if contacted by one infected individual; at the same time, the infected individuals may recover and return to being susceptible individuals at rate \u03bc. For the SIR model, the individuals can exist in another state: R, recovered/removed; they cannot be infected again.",

[34] considered two distinct possibilities: (a) M only summarizes information about the current state of the disease, i.e.  M only depends on current values of state variables, and (b) M also summarizes information about past values of state variables. In the present study, we adopt a linear form of (a), i.e.  M is a linear function of the current prevalence of the disease (see Ref.  [34] and the references cited therein). This preliminary work will focus on a static network, i.e. ignoring the population demographics (recruitment or death), and it considers the situation where the media coverage only reduces the transmission rate between susceptible individuals and infected individuals.",

P(M,k) measures the impact of media coverage on a individual in group k, which is related to the number of people he/she meets and the current density level of media coverage. The term \u03b2P(M,k) measures the effect of the reduction of transmission rate between susceptible and infectious individuals due to the reporting of infectious cases in the media. The half-saturation constant a>0 reflects the impact of media coverage on contact transmission. For uncorrelated networks [16], \u0398(t)=\u2211k=1nkIk\u2211k=1nkNk represents the expectation that any given edge points to an infected individual. The parameter \u03c9 is a proportional constant with which media coverage is being implemented based on the current state of infectious cases, and \u03bb represents the depletion rate of media coverage due to ineffective implementation. In addition, we use another parameter m0 to reflect the density level of media coverage on the disease even though there is no infectious case in the region under consideration. This can be explained as follows: due to the increasing trend of globalization and the development of information technology, information about infectious cases found in one region may spread rapidly to another region without this disease through media coverage, for example, in the case of the media coverage of the outbreak of SARS in 2003.",

From R0<1, since R0 is a decreasing function of m0, we obtain R0\u2032=limm0\u21920+R0\u22641. Since the first equation of system (4) is independent of the second, according to the results obtained by d\u2019Onofrio et al.  [37], one obtains that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R0\u2032\u22641, i.e., limt\u2192+\u221eik(t)=0,k=1,2,\u2026,n. The limit system of the information variable M(t) satisfies dM(t)/dt=m0\u2212\u03bbM(t), and it comes to limt\u2192+\u221eM(t)=M0. By comparison arguments, we know that the disease-free equilibrium E0 is globally attractive in \u0393 for system (2). This, combined with Theorem 1, implies that E0 is globally asymptotically stable, and hence the proof is complete. \u25a1\n",

We emphasize that this preliminary work does not consider the factors of edges rewiring, but only focuses on the case in which the media coverage reduces the transmission rate between susceptible and infected individuals. We can generalize the current model in many aspects. For example, a susceptible individual may cut its links to an infected individual and rewire those links once the information he/she receives due to media coverage reaches a certain threshold  [41]; or we could consider a multiplex network with two layers  [42], in which one is the disease transmission network and the other is the information transmission network, but the two networks have different topologies.
