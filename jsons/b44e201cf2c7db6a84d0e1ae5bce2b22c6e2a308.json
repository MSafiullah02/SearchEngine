These estimation results are robust to alternative specifications and after controlling for confounding factors and excluding outliers. Policymakers should allocate resources towards the protection of the elderly and those suffering from underlying conditions such as obesity. They should also exercise caution about administering nicotine patches or the BCG vaccine to fight COVID-19 without the backing of concrete scientific evidence.",

The introduction of the urban population variable in column (4) reduces the magnitude and statistical significance of the coefficient estimate for the obesity rate (p < 0.01) and only marginally affects the rest. The coefficient estimate for the urban population variable is not statistically significant. In column (5), the introduction of the BCG vaccination variable has virtually no effect on the estimation results. In fact, prior to its introduction, about 74.7% of the variation in COVID-19 deaths was explained by the explanatory variables in column (4). This percentage remains the same after the introduction of the BCG vaccination variable, suggesting that the latter variable yields no additional explanatory power. Columns (6) and (7) report estimation results that introduce the smoking prevalence and PM25 variables, respectively. The coefficient estimates for both variables are not statistically significant and the corresponding adjusted R 2 decline to 0.745 and 0.742, respectively. In addition, the fact that the coefficient estimate for health spending loses statistical significance in column (7) suggests that there exists some interaction effect with the urban population (as a measure of urbanization), smoking prevalence, and PM25 pollution. Intuitively, this interaction could be explained by how urbanization, particulate matter pollution, and smoking prevalence could represent a significant trigger of related health care spending. However, the absence of statistical significance and lower adjusted R 2 values suggest that these two variables, just like the BCG vaccination variable, have no explanatory power.",

It is worth noting that this is likely related to the spreading of diseases within dense populations in urban areas rather than to pollution created by cities. In fact, this is confirmed by the lack of statistical significance for the coefficient estimate of PM25.",

That is, countries with a greater share of spending on healthcare, a larger proportion of people above 65 years of age, and a larger obesity rate have greater COVID-19 mortality. When interpreted as elasticities, these results suggest that a 10% in spending on health care is associated with a 1.24% greater reported COVID-19 mortality. Individual increases of 10% in obesity and in the urban population are also associated with corresponding increases of 0.36% and 0.17% on COVID-19 deaths, respectively. Finally, and contrary to previous research, there is no evidence of a link between COVID-19 mortality and BCG vaccination, smoking prevalence, and PM25 pollution.",

First, countries that have a larger share of health care spending have greater (reported) COVID-19 mortality. It is this paper's contention that greater spending likely reflects a country's ability to better track, document, and report COVID-19 deaths. This suggests that countries with low spending on health care may not have the resources to accurately report COVID-19 deaths and may even have an incentive to underreport. Second, consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention There are evidently other factors not included in these estimations that could contribute to COVID-19 mortality. For instance, a country's timely response to the pandemic, irrespective of its spending on health care, could have measurable effects on COVID-19 mortality. New Zealand is an important success story (Cousins, 2020) , whereas the United States, to this day, has had one of the worst responses in the world (Blodget & Plotz, 2020) . Countries that have implemented and enforced extreme lock-down measures have likely fared better in terms of COVID-19 deaths than those that did not. This research has important policy implications. Policymakers should allocate resources towards the protection of the most vulnerable members of society from the pandemic, namely the elderly and those suffering from underlying con-8 All rights reserved.

            "text": "fact, most European countries that have relatively high spending on health care also happen to have a high number of deaths in absolute and in capita terms. Another important observation is that a number of countries that have low health care spending have reported a relatively low number of deaths. In such countries, extreme lock-down and confinement measures would have been warranted after the realization that the pandemic would be too overwhelming and could lead to greater mortality and a collapse of the health care system. Of course, fewer reported deaths could also be the result of insufficient resources to track and report all deaths related to COVID-19.The evidence also suggests that countries that have a larger share of the population above 65 years of age have greater COVID-19 mortality, consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020b). Countries with a higher obesity rate also have greater COVID-19 mortality, consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020a). There is no evidence suggesting a link between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 deaths, contrary to Miller et al.(2020). There also exists no link between smoking prevalence or pollution on COVID-19 mortality, contrary toFarsalinos et al. (2020b,a)  and Wu et al.(2020), respectively.",

Estimates of leverage values for all countries, as shown in Figure 1, indicate that there are four countries with leverage values exceeding this level, namely the United States (0.185), Japan (0.175), Sierra Leone (0.139), and Singapore (0.124).",
