This chapter does not review the applicable guidelines or standards for air quality in these facilities, which typically do not mention UVGI, but the references and Chapter 11 may be consulted for more detailed information. The types of UV systems covered in this chapter have been addressed in detail in previous chapters and these designs are not revisited here. Instead, this chapter discusses the various applications of UV to the indicated facilities, how they have been applied in the past, what effectiveness they have previously demonstrated, and how new UV systems may be applied to reduce the microbiological hazards associated with each type of facility. Also addressed here are the types of pathogens that are unique to certain facilities and, in particular, nosocomial pathogens and the problem of increasing drug resistance.",

UVGI has been used for the disinfection of medical equipment, entire rooms, ventilation air, and surgical sites for well over half a century, often with definitive results. New applications are being developed even today and although UVGI is not a total solution to the problem of disease transmission in health care facilities, it can be an effective and economic component of any program designed to reduce hospital-acquired infections. This chapter discusses the various ways in which UVGI systems can be applied in hospitals and related health care facilities, including dental offices, laboratories, and veterinary facilities. Limited mention is made in most health care literature of UVGI, although some recent guidelines have acknowledged its potential effectiveness (CDC 2003 , ASHRAE 2008 . Chapter 11 can be consulted for more detailed information on the various standards and guidelines that address the use of UVGI in health care facilities. For a complete review of codes and standards for hospital ventilation and air quality see, for example, Kowalski (2006) or ASHRAE (2003) .",

Airborne and surface borne microbiological hazards in health care facilities can cause infections in both patients and health care workers. Nosocomial infections have proven to be a persistent problem in hospitals and some drug-resistant infections have transitioned from being hospitalacquired to community-acquired, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Nosocomial infections can have complex, multifaceted etiologies that involve one or more routes of transmission and so the solution may involve more than one type of disinfection system (i.e. air disinfection, surface disinfection, water disinfection, equipment disinfection, personnel decontamination, etc.), procedural methods, and formal standards for air quality (Kowalski 2008a) .",

The number of microbes that have demonstrated increased drug resistance in recent years is extensive and growing (Kowalski 2007b) . The drug resistance of Streptococcal infections, which can cause Scarlet Fever, has increased from 0.8% to 28% in the past decade. MRSA has shown up repeatedly outside hospital settings and has become a contamination problem in athletic environments. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (XTB) has caused a resurgence in TB infections worldwide, and close to a million people die each year from this disease. Strains of multiple drug resistant (MDR) Haemophilus influenzae are being increasingly reported from around the world (Jain and Agarwal 1996) . Multidrug resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, have been recognized among casualties returning from battlefields (Davis et al. 2005) . Various fungi can also cause nosocomial infections and unlike viruses and bacteria, most fungi hail from outdoors but can grow indoors (Kowalski and Bahnfleth 1998) .",

The relationship between airborne bacteria and the incidence of joint sepsis. Adapted from Lidwell et al. (1983) 1990, Grieble et al. 1970) . Table 17 .1 summarizes the various nosocomial microbes that have airborne potential. Most nosocomial infections have been identified as having at least some potential for airborne transmission although most of them are primarily spread by other routes, such as direct contact. These microbes are ranked by estimated order of occurrence and are classified as Contagious, Noncontagious, and Endogenous (present as part of normal human flora). The last column in this table indicates whether or not the microbe has demonstrated any evolving drug resistance. It is clear from this tabulation that drug resistance is a growing and widespread problem and that all three microbial categories, viruses, bacteria, and fungi, have been developing such resistance. As drugs for treating these nosocomial infections become less effective and less available, increasing reliance on engineering methods such as UVGI may be one of the few remaining means of effectively dealing with the problem.",

Many managers assume that if the design requirements for ventilation are met then the air is sterile, but this is rarely, if ever, the case. Levels of airborne contaminants in ORs are often lower than in the general wards, but not significantly so. For hospital air, WHO recommends the limits of 100 cfu/m 3 for bacteria and 50 cfu/m 3 for fungi (WHO 1988) . There are currently no standards for OR aerobiology in the USA, but the current standard used in China is 200 cfu/m 3 , while the EU has suggested a limit of 10 cfu/m 3 , based on the ISO Class 7 cleanroom limit (EU Grade B) used in the pharmaceutical industry and as a target for ultra clean ventilation (UCV) systems (Durmaz et al. 2005 , Kowalski 2007a ). It is doubtful any ORs could achieve a limit of 10 cfu/m 3 unless the OR was unoccupied, but it is a target worth striving for. Figure 17 .2 is a figurative diagram showing the various sources of microbiological contamination in an operating room. If the supply air is assumed to be sterile (which is not always the case), then the main sources are the occupants, local internal surfaces, and infiltration. Although ORs are generally under positive pressure with respect to external areas, this may not always be the case and even if it is, the opening of doors can allow contaminants to enter.",

Table 17.2 summarizes the various studies that have been performed (2007) Overhead Average Reduction 80 on operating rooms, including all those equipped with Overhead UV systems, and these show a net average reduction of 80% (barrier system results not included).",

(1979) demonstrated a 49% decrease in airborne bacteria with an Overhead UV system. reports on an Overhead UV system that produced a 99-100% decrease in aerosolized E. coli, and that resulted in a 54% decrease in airborne bacteria during procedures. The Overhead Surgical System implemented by Ritter et al. (2007) consists of a series of UV lamp fixtures suspended overhead in the OR in recessed lighting troffers. This system includes 8 UV lamps that produce a net average of about 25 \u03bcW/cm 2 at operating table height. According to Ritter et al. (2007) , this system was able to reduce the surgical site infection rate from 1.77 to 0.5%. The study did not report airborne concentrations of bacteria in the ORs but it is possible that this system could reduce airborne levels significantly, even with personnel present. It is likely that this UV system inhibited both airborne transport and survival of bacteria on surfaces, including microbes that settle on equipment, on personnel and on floors. Since the irradiance of the UV in this system exceeds ACGIH limits, personnel are required to be completely covered, including eye protection, during operating procedures. Systems can be operated for short periods during surgery, but can also be operated for longer periods when the operating room is unoccupied to provide area decontamination between procedures. Figure 17 .4 shows a diagram of how the UV lamp fixtures are located relative to the operating table. In older systems, UV lamp fixtures were often hung below the ceiling directly above the operating table.",

Figure 17 .9 shows an example of how Lower Room UV systems may be applied in hallways surrounding a group of ORs, and which will help protect the ORs against contamination brought in from foot traffic.",

In addition to pathogenic disease hazards, laboratory workers can develop allergies from prolonged or chronic exposure to animals (Hunskaar and Fosse 1993) .Many species of animal diseases have the ability to transmit to humans or vice versa since the biological and physiological similarities between humans and animals are sufficient to permit such exchanges. Whenever such interspecies transmission occurs, secondary transmissions are rare. Often, such interspecies transmissions occur by direct contact or very close proximity, but airborne transmission is an ever-present possibility. Contact transmissions may be controlled procedurally, but the control of airborne transmission requires engineered systems. Table 17 .5 lists the wide variety of zoonoses that can potentially transmit by the airborne route in animal laboratory or other animal facilities (adapted from Kowalski et al. 2002) . Most of these pathogens and allergens can also transmit by direct contact and other means, such as ingestion or vie blood contamination. Few of the zoonotic microbes in the list have been evaluated for their UV susceptibility, but most of them are sufficiently physiologically similar to various human pathogens that the UV rate constants for the human pathogenic species may be used as an approximation. Genomic analysis of UV susceptibility is also possible (Kowalski et al. 2009 ).",
