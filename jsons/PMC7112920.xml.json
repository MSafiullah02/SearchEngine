            "text": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that emerged as the causal agent of respiratory disease in pigs and an acute febrile encephalitis in humans working in the pig industry in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998 (Chua et al., 2000). NiV is classified in the new genus Henipavirus, based on unique genetic characteristics distinct from other paramyxoviruses (Eaton et al., 2006, Eaton et al., 2007), together with Hendra virus (HeV) which has caused repeated incidences of severe respiratory and neurological diseases among horses and humans in Australia since 1994 (Bishop and Broder, 2008, Murray et al., 1995). Natural NiV infections were also confirmed in dogs, cats and horses. Further NiV outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh and India almost every year since 2001 (Bishop and Broder, 2008, Chadha et al., 2006, Harcourt et al., 2005, Hsu et al., 2004). Henipavirus reservoirs appear to be several species of fruit bats, primarily of the genus Pteropus. During the NiV outbreak on the Malay Peninsula, humans and other species are presumed to be infected through an intermediate species such as pigs (Eaton et al., 2006). On the other hand, in the NiV outbreak in Bangladesh in 2004, involvement of animals other than fruit bats was not confirmed, indicating direct transmission from bats to humans (Hsu et al., 2004, Luby et al., 2006). Human-to-human transmission has also been suggested based on the epidemiological studies conducted in Bangladesh (Gurley et al., 2007a, Gurley et al., 2007b). The presence of antibodies against NiV or NiV-like viruses in fruit bats have been reported in Thailand (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2005), Cambodia (Olson et al., 2002, Reynes et al., 2005), Indonesia (Sendow et al., 2006), Madagascar (Lehle et al., 2007), Ghana (Hayman et al., 2008) and China (Li et al., 2008).",

Although the specificities of these ELISAs are fairly high, they still yield false positive results. This means that confirmatory diagnosis is required when an animal is suspected of being infected with NiV by ELISA. The serum neutralization test, which detects neutralizing antibodies against the viral fusion (F) and/or attachment (G) glycoproteins is regarded currently as the gold standard for serological diagnosis, and is accepted as the reference standard of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) (OIE, 2008). Although cross-reactivity exists between NiV and HeV by serum neutralization test, they can be differentiated when sera are tested against both viruses simultaneously (Daniels et al., 2001).",

For this purpose, the sera obtained from Japanese field pigs (Fig. 3a), which were thought to have no previous exposure to NiV, were used. In previous reports of serum neutralization test using pseudotyped viruses expressing the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Fukushi et al., 2006, Fukushi et al., 2005), 50% reduction of infectivity compared to the no-serum control was used as the cut-off value to define a positive neutralization outcome. In this study, a similar approach was used with the neutralization titer defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution resulting in at least 50% reduction in VSV\u2013NiV\u2013GFP infectivity. Analysis of the data presented in Fig. 3a from sero-negative pigs demonstrates that non-specific inhibition may occur in serum samples up to 1:80. Diluting the sample sera greater than 1:80 as a starting dilution should avoid potential non-specific inhibition and allow testing of samples where only small amounts of sera are available. If testing only a 1:80 dilution of sera as a preliminary screen for sero-positive animals, all sera tested as shown in Fig. 2 would have been correctly characterized as either positive or negative. This supports the use of 1:80 as the threshold serum concentration for determining specific neutralization with high confidence.",

            "text": "In this study, a serum neutralization test using pseudotyped viruses possessing NiV-F/G proteins (VSV\u2013NiV\u2013GFP) for detection of NiV infection was developed. Due to their inability to produce infectious progeny virus and quantitative nature, pseudotyped viruses would provide a safe diagnostic tool for conducting serum neutralization tests and facilitate research on virus entry and cell tropism. One of the pseudotyping system used most commonly is based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and the VSV\u0394G* system, in which the VSV G gene is replaced by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. So far, the VSV\u0394G* system has been reported to produce several pseudotyped viruses incorporating the envelope glycoproteins of RNA viruses, such as measles virus (Tatsuo et al., 2000), hantavirus (Ogino et al., 2003), Ebola virus (Takada et al., 1997), hepatitis C virus (Matsuura et al., 2001) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Fukushi et al., 2005). For diagnostics, a neutralization test, using SARS-CoV-S proteins-bearing pseudotyped viruses was reported to be more sensitive than a conventional virus neutralization test using live SARS-CoV (Fukushi et al., 2006). Recently, pseudotyped viruses possessing NiV-F/G were developed to examine the virus entry (Negrete et al., 2005), however, they have not yet been examined for their potential in diagnostic applications. Using the serum neutralization test in this study, the infectivity of VSV\u2013NiV\u2013GFP was measured by counting the number of GFP-expressing cells or by measuring the fluorescent intensity using a plate fluorometer. This new assay is significant on several levels and will afford rapid and high-throughput diagnosis, facilitate epidemiological monitoring during outbreak investigations or surveillance, and can be conducted under BSL2 conditions with a greater level of safety and substantial cost savings.",

Although there seemed to be positive correlation between the results obtained by the two methods, the former appeared far more sensitive than the latter (Table 1). This remarkably high sensitivity is likely due to the inability of VSV\u2013NiV\u2013GFP to undergo multi-cycle replication due to lack of its G gene. Indeed, neutralization of VSV\u2013NiV\u2013GFP can, therefore, be achieved with neutralizing antibodies that just inhibit the initial binding of pseudotyped viruses to the cells. Whereas, in the case of a serum neutralization test employing live-NiV, any virus which successfully enters the cell will replicate and multiply, and typically greater levels of neutralizing antibodies are required to inhibit further viral spread, often resulting in an apparently lower neutralization titer. A further advantage of the VSV\u2013NiV\u2013GFP system was its ability to use far less serum, hence reduced the potential effect of cell toxicity (Table 1). In addition, the data also demonstrated that NiV-neutralizing antibodies below the detection level of the conventional neutralization test could be detected using this assay system, for example cat No.1 (Table 1).",

In general, field sera seem to be more problematic in exhibiting non-specific reactivity in serum diagnosis (such as ELISA and virus neutralization tests) than sera from animals infected experimentally. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicated that the non-specific inhibition was not the result of \u03b1JEV antibody. One possibility is that the non-specific reactivity may result from differences in nutritional or immunological conditions of the animals, the degree of hemolysis or in the preparation of samples. However, by setting the appropriate threshold serum concentration to minimize the influence of non-specific activities, reliable diagnosis was achievable (Fig. 3).",
