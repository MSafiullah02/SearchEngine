            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. This virus was later designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease or syndrome was named COVID-19. As of April 8, 2020, COVID-19 has affected more than 1.5 million people, resulting in more than 87,000 deaths worldwide Q5 . 1 SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a spectrum of disease ranging from mild to hypoxic respiratory failure, ARDS, and multiorgan failure and shock. A potential etiology of these severe manifestations of COVID-19 is cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and its most severe form, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). 2 These syndromes are characterized by an excessive production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-a]). [3] [4] [5] [6] Thus, anticytokine therapy has been suggested as a treatment for COVID-19, although its safety and efficacy in this population are yet to be established. 2 Tocilizumab is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved IL-6 receptor antagonist that is commonly used to treat CRS secondary to chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. 7 Tocilizumab is theorized to treat the CRS that can occur in patients with COVID-19, similar to its use in CRS secondary to chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. 8 Thus far, reports detailing the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 undergoing this treatment strategy are sparse. We report two cases detailing poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19 CRS after treatment with tocilizumab.",

On examination, he was febrile to 39.4 C (102.9 F), in moderate respiratory distress, and had oxyhemoglobin desaturation. COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive PCR test result obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab, and he was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Over the next 2 days, he continued to develop worsening hypoxemia, bilateral chest infiltrates (Fig 1) , and accessory muscle fatigue requiring intubation and transfer to the medical ICU. There, he was diagnosed with ARDS and treated with low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and a bumetanide drip. On day 4 of admission (9 days after symptom onset), he developed septic shock and was started on a norepinephrine drip. Given this decompensation and increasing inflammatory markers (Table 1) , he was treated with a dose of tocilizumab (400 mg IV). The next day the patient developed ST segment depression in leads V4-V6 on ECG and increased troponin levels, which peaked at 30.39 ng/mL. ECG revealed mild global hypokinesis, and a diagnosis of viral myocarditis was made. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements confirmed a reduced cardiac index. The next day the patient developed a fever of 109 F Q6 and indexes of septic shock (normal cardiac index and reduced systemic vascular resistance) refractory to four vasopressor agents and passed away. Repeat laboratory measures (Table 1 ) suggested the development of sHLH (cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase, hypofibrinogenemia). This decompensation occurred despite a decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) after tocilizumab therapy.",

Evidence suggests that a deficient T-cell response underlies the severity of COVID-19. CD8 \u00fe and CD4 \u00fe T-cell levels are decreased in patients with COVID-19 and correlate with severity of disease. 6 Moreover, diabetes, which is associated with T-cell-mediated immunosuppression, is a risk factor for COVID-19. 10 IL-6 promotes immature thymocyte differentiation into cytotoxic T cells and is needed for B-cell production of IgM and IgG. 8 Thus, it is possible that elevated IL-6 levels are a compensatory mechanism for an impaired, virally directed cytotoxic T-cell response. Thus decreasing IL-6 levels in COVID-19 may promote increased viral replication if tocilizumab is used too early in the disease course. In fact, viral replication has been found as late as 22 days after symptom onset. 11 In our first case, the patient developed viral myocarditis, an established presentation of severe COVID-19 on day 10 after symptom onset. 12, 13 We fear that tocilizumab may have been responsible for the development of viral myocarditis. This notion is further supported by decreased lymphocyte counts posttreatment in both the patients, suggesting decreased IL-6-mediated lymphocyte maturation.",
