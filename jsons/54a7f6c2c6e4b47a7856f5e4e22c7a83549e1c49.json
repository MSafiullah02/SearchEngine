In line with this, our study analyses the abstracts of papers related to COVID-19 and coronavirus-related-research using association rule text mining in order to find the most interestingness words, on the one hand, and relationships between them on the other. Then, a method, called information cartography, was applied for extracting structured knowledge from a huge amount of association rules. On the basis of these methods, the purpose of our study was to show how researchers have responded in similar epidemic/pandemic situations throughout history.",

The former is a data mining method used to search for interestingness terms and their mutual relations in the form of association rules. This method demands the parsing of text documents and highlights the words that are distinguished according to the appropriate measures. These words are called terms, while the relationships among them are described in the form of association rules. The latter is devoted to extracting structured knowledge from the huge amount of association rules generated in the first step. In line with this, the concept of information cartography has been applied [11] which is capable of creating structured summaries of information, and visualize them in the form of metro maps. The role of the metro map in helping users understand their surroundings, also is similar to the effect the metro map of information has on understanding information landscapes [10] . Visualizations with metro maps can even tell stories to users and provide them with good directions. In essence, the metro maps consist of a set of metro lines, where each metro line interprets the same story from a different aspect. Metro stops on these lines introduce salient pieces of information (i.e. a definite term), while the interrelations among these pieces ensure the plot of the story. Recently, arXiv:2004.03397v1 [cs.IR] 6 Apr 2020 this methodology has been applied to understanding information in many areas [9, 12] . However, the concept of metro maps serves as a basis for exploring the extracted knowledge in this study.",

These simple rules serve as building blocks for creating a word graph with source X and sink nodes Y connected with a directed arc, when there is an association rule X \u21d2 Y (fourth step).
