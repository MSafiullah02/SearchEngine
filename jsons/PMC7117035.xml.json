Numerous intracellular and secreted PLA2 have been characterized and classified into different groups based on their structural features [5]. They are characterized by a low molecular mass (13\u201318 kDa), the presence of several disulfide bridges, a broad selectivity for phospholipids with different polar head groups and fatty acid chains and a Ca2+-dependent catalytic mechanism. During the last decade, 11 different groups of sPLA2 have been identified in mammals: IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, XIIA and XIIB [4], [5], [6], [7].",

The group 3 coronavirus infects only avian and the acute bronchitis is characterized by tracheal rales, coughing, and sneezing and it is a highly contagious viral disease of the respiratory tract in chickens [16].

The qPCR conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min; 45 amplification cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, annealing for 10 s (5 \u00b0C above melting temperature of the primer with lower value), elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 8 s (25 bp/s + 2 s), measurement of fluorescence at 81\u201392 \u00b0C for 1 s (see Table 3\n). After amplification, melting curve analysis was performed as follows: 98 \u00b0C for 10 s; annealing temperature for 20 s; continuous temperature gradient to 95 \u00b0C with 5 acquisitions/s. The tissue cDNA samples (from animals and the indicated tissues and cells) were diluted 1/10 with nuclease free water, and the same cDNA dilution was used for all qPCR reactions. A fresh 10\u22121\u201310\u22124 serial dilution was prepared from each target gene to be analyzed starting from the 1/10 dilution of a purified PCR product, and every gene was measured twice independently with duplicate samples. From the serial dilution, 10\u22121\u201310\u22124 dilutions were used as an internal standard. As housekeeping genes, we measured the mRNA expression levels of chicken \u03b2-actin. The qPCR primers used are shown in Table 3. In qPCR, every gene had PCR efficiencies ranging from 1.902 to 1.972, as calculated from the internal standard; thus, no efficiency correlation was performed. The Light Cycler 480 Software (release 1.1.0.0520) with absolute quantification was used to calculate the concentrations and standard deviations of the samples. The concentration of the target gene was divided by the concentration of the housekeeping gene thus showing the relative expression of the mRNA in the tissue. This calculation was performed for all tissues analyzed. Standard deviations were calculated by multiplying the obtained relative value with the standard deviation of the target. The resulting relative and standard deviation values were scaled to a range of 0\u201310 including the standard deviations.",

The nomenclature of the human PLA2s as suggested by Wilson and Schusterwoldan [19] is adopted throughout this text. PCRs were then performed to amplify the corresponding cDNAs using total mRNA from chicken pancreas, intestine, heart, colon, liver, lung and spleen tissues as template. The resulting DNA fragments were cloned and sequenced. Using this approach we obtained the full-length cDNA coding ChPLA2-IB, ChPLA2-IIA, ChPLA2-IIE, ChPLA2-V, and chPLA2-X. The cDNA sequences of these chicken PLA2s (Fig. 1\n) were deposited in the GenBank database under the accession numbers EU617018 (ChPLA2-IB), GU474517 (ChPLA2-IIA), JF411005 (ChPLA2-IIE) JF411004 (ChPLA2-V) and GU474518 (ChPLA2-X). The data concerning the newly identified chicken cDNAs and proteins are summarized in Table 1, together with the available informations on human and mouse orthologs. When full-length clones could be obtained, the sizes of the predicted proteins were found to be similar to those of human sPLA2s, lending support to the assigned designations of the galline phospholipases A2.",

Based on their structural features, chicken group IIA and group IIE sPLA2 are clearly members of the group II collection of sPLA2 [1], [4], [5], [6], [20], [21], [22]. Indeed, both sPLA2 display the specific features of group II sPLA2, including a cystein residue at position 50 and a cystein residue that terminates the group II-specific C-terminal extension of 7 residues (Fig. 2). A BLAST search for homology with the ChPLA2-X protein sequence revealed that this protein has the highest identity level (45%) with hPLA2-X [21]. In contrast, the identity level of ChPLA2-X to other Gallus gallus sPLA2 is lower than 38%. In addition, ChPLA2-X shares with hPLA2-X the same structural features [23]. It is predicted that ChPLA2-X consists of 31-amino acid prepropeptide sequence ending with a basic dipeptide (R\u2013R) and a mature protein of 124 residues compared with the human (same dipeptide R\u2013R) and the mouse PLA2-X which is made of a 28-amino acid prepropeptide sequence ending with a basic dipeptide (K\u2013R) and a mature protein of 123 residues. Like hPLA2-X and mPLA2-X, ChPLA2-X has 8 conserved disulfides bridges but it has a group II like C-terminal extension of 9 residues instead of 8 (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "The infectious bronchitis virus, a group 3 coronavirus (CoV), causes a costly viral disease in chicken [16]. It is responsible of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) in chickens at all ages and then a loss of production. Upon infection, the virus is present in the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and kidney and it induces serious lung injury [16]. The CoV infecting humans is responsible for severe respiratory acute syndrome [17] characterized by hypoxemia and non cardiogenic pulmonary oedema [8]. The comparative gene expression of sPLA2 in healthy chickens and chickens with infectious bronchitis was performed here for the first time. A marked decrease by 30-, 12- and 2-fold in the respective expression levels of ChPLA2-IB, ChPLA2-IIA and ChPLA2-X was observed in infected chicken lung. Indeed, ChPLA2-IIA was found to be present in several tissues at high and moderate level of normal intestine, heart liver and lung, and its expression was markedly reduced in avian infectious bronchitis (Fig. 3). These findings suggest a down regulation of sPLA2 gene expression as an immunity response, to limit for instance the hydrolysis of lung surfactant by these enzymes. In a previous work, Vial et al. [44] reported that the expression of sPLA2-IIA in alveolar macrophages is down-regulated by an inflammatory stimulus suggesting a possible negative control of sPLA2-IIA during alveolar macrophages activation. In several other studies, Touqui et al. have suggested a mechanism of down regulation of sPLA2-IIA by the lung surfactant and intracellular AMPc in alveolar macrophages [45].",

This observation could be related to an anatomical particularity in chickens, in which there is no sharp boundary between digestive and respiratory system due to the absence of diaphragm as the case in mammals [46]. It is worth noticing that hPLA2-IB has been detected in serum of patients with ARDS but not in healthy controls [47] and it can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for future development of ARDS [48]. The enzyme has also been implicated in complications of severe acute pancreatitis [47], [49], a recognized risk factor in ARDS. ChPLA2-X, totally absent in healthy chicken pancreas, was found to be highly expressed in infected chicken pancreas (104.78). The sPLA2-X could therefore be considered as a good marker in pulmonary disease. Since pancreatic enzymes such as sPLA2-IB can be found in the blood of patients, it would be interesting to investigate the presence of sPLA2-X in the blood of infected chicken using specific antibodies.",

Moreover, it was shown that activated cells secrete sPLA2-V which exert transcellular lipolytic activity on neighboring inflammatory cells [53]. The elevation of sPLA2-V expression in mice lungs with severe inflammation can be associated with an ongoing surfactant hydrolysis often observed in lung dysfunction [11]. In addition to the increase of gene expression level of ChPLA2-V in lungs, we observed an increase in its expression level in spleen, as well as, the decrease in ChPLA2-IB, -IIA and -X in lungs followed by a decrease in the expression level in spleen.
