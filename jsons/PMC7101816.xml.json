Immune globulin products from human plasma were first used in 1952 to treat immune deficiencies. About 30 years later, Paul Imbach observed that patients with immune thrombocytopenia and agammaglobulinemia receiving immunoglobulins as immune replacement therapy recovered from their thrombocytopenia [1]. This was the first observation to suggest treatment of autoimmune diseases with IVIg. Later on, the ability to administer large quantities of immunoglobulin intravenously was gained owing to technological advances, among them the improvement in plasma fractionation. As a result, IVIg slowly became an important treatment option in a number of diseases beyond primary immune deficiencies, including autoimmune and acute inflammatory conditions, most of them off-label indications. These indications have crossed over into almost every medical specialty. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of IVIg for the following six conditions: primary immunodeficiencies, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Kawasaki disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia, and pediatric HIV. Many off-label indications have emerged; some of these new indications for IVIg are based on solid clinical evidence; others are based on relatively few data or anecdotal reports (case series, case reports). This lack of firm evidence is due to the difficulty in performing appropriate clinical trials in diseases with low prevalence. There is a need for an evidence-based guidance for the use of IVIg to help improve patient care consistency.",

The FDA has recommended the use of particular preparations of IVIg for each labeled indication in accordance to the specific preparation used to demonstrate a beneficial effect. Of course, there is selection bias since generally only a few preparations have been tested for a given disease. This is in recognition of the difficulty to reproduce the properties of an IVIg preparation, which may vary from one manufacturer to the other due to differences in the donor population, number of donors, period of donation, production methods, virus/bacteria inactivation methods, etc. IVIg properties may also vary from batch to batch made by the same manufacturer, complicating homogeneity even more.",

We used all clinical data ranging from multicentered randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analysis to case reports. From each article, we extracted details of the study design, number of patients, type of intervention including the dose and IVIg preparation used (if mentioned), and response to treatment. The relevant data were summarized in a hierarchical manner according to the study design and number of participants. When evidence was based on higher level of evidence studies, such as RCTs, lower levels of evidence studies (such as case control studies) were disregarded. Specific diseases were classified in tables according to the specialty they belong to and are followed by a short summary of recommendations, including the level of evidence and the strength of recommendation, as assessed by known guidelines (Table 1) [2]. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review which summarizes all up-to-date published data regarding the usage of IVIg in autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, and other indications.\n\n",

Infants with transient hyogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI) may remain asymptomatic or develop recurrent sinopulmonary infections, but severe or life-threatening infections are rare. In general, supportive and antimicrobial therapies are sufficient management for the treatment of specific infections in patients with THI. In cases in which infections are severe or refractory to conventional therapy, IVIg is sometimes considered although literature reports are lacking (strength of recommendation I).",

We have included an array of clinical conditions, some in which the use of IVIg is expected according to their pathogenesis, such as primary immunodeficiencies and rheumatic diseases, and others somewhat less obvious indications including cardiac and oncologic diseases. In some diseases, the usage of IVIg was found to be highly recommended (with a level of evidence A and strength of recommendation I): Kawasaki disease, acquired hypogammaglobulinemia, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, hemolytic disease of the newborn, acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. For many other diseases, treatment with IVIg was found effective as well, but this was less well established, either due to a lack of well-designed studies or due to conflicting evidence among them. In some diseases, there is a strong recommendation against using IVIg (with a level of evidence A and strength of recommendation III): stem cell/bone marrow transplantation, inclusion body myositis, recurrent pregnancy loss due to antiphospholipid syndrome, optic neuritis, and intractable childhood epilepsy. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of IVIg in such a large span of diseases fortifies the accumulating evidence that many pathological conditions are autoimmune mediated.",
