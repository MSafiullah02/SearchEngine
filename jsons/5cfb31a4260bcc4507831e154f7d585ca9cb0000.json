To date, 7 human coronaviruses have been identified, including the 3 epidemic viruses of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and the newest, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 2 These 3 epidemic viruses have similar sequence identity, sharing more than 50% genome sequences. 3 In December of 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown origin began to spread in the central city of Wuhan, China. Now identified as SARS-CoV-2, the virus had gone on to infect more than 300,000 people worldwide by March 2020. 4 The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) having led to thousands of deaths and hospitalizations worldwide. While most COVID-19 cases have been identified as mild, more extreme diagnoses have led to respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. 5 As this infectious disease continues to spread, further clinical and epidemiological characteristics must be elucidated to improve our understanding of the true extent of the virus, in order to improve diagnostic and treatment capabilities and reduce its overall impact on morbidity and mortality.",

Received 17 March 2020; received in revised form 7 April 2020; accepted 7 April 2020; available online xxx levels of liver disease. 6 A new study found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cholangiocytes, leading to cholangiocyte dysfunction and inducing a systemic inflammatory response leading to liver injury. 7 As of March 10, 2020, 7 relatively large-scale hospitalbased studies have reported the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19, including some insights into other factors, which may lead to COVID-19 induced liver damage. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In these studies, elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were reported, ranging from 14% to 53%. 8, 9, 11, 14 Additionally, a pathological study of liver biopsy specimens from a patient who died from COVID-19 showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may have led to this liver damage. 15 However, little data exists that has comprehensively analyzed other liver enzymes and clinical characteristics of liver failure among patients with COVID-19. Hence, the aim of this study was to report the clinical course and liver test parameters in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China. With better knowledge of pathogenesis, more targeted therapies and holistic care models could be developed, which may help to prevent severe liver injury or failure in patients with COVID-19.",

As COVID-19 is a new, emerging infectious disease, guidance or consensus on liver injury classifications are lacking. Thus, we classified the pattern of these abnormalities as hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed. Patients who had raised ALT and/or AST more than 3\u00d7 the upper limit unit of normal (ULN) were classified as hepatocyte type; patients who had raised ALP or GGT twice the ULN were classified as cholangiocyte type; and patients who had a combination of both ALT/AST elevated more than 3\u00d7 the ULN and ALP/ GGT twice the ULN were classified as mixed type (Abnormality type (1)). To further describe liver test characteristics, we defined ALT and/or AST over 3\u00d7 ULN, ALP, GGT, and/or TBIL over 2\u00d7 ULN as liver injury. Moreover, as the magnitude of the liver test elevations in our patients ranged from mild to moderate, we also defined patterns of liver abnormality according to another criteria. Patients were classified as hepatocyte type when the AST/ALT activity was higher than the ALP/GGT activity, with the liver enzyme activities calculated by multiples of their ULN, respectively, and were classified as cholangiocyte type when the reverse occurred (Abnormality type (2)).",

As the presence of underlying liver disease may also play a role in the association of liver tests with disease severity, we also conducted sensitivity analyses excluding patients with underlying liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B and alcoholic/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Table 1 shows that at admission, about half of the patients had abnormal liver test results and 21 (5%) had liver injury. Patients with abnormal liver test results were older, had a higher body mass index (BMI), were male, and had no clear contact history (p <0.05). Patients also tended to have underlying liver diseases, including NAFLD, alcoholic liver disease, and chronic hepatitis B (p = 0.001), and had cough as an initial symptom (p = 0.04) ( Table 1) . Most of the patients had abnormal liver test results within 1-2\u00d7 ULN at admission and only a few (<4%) had abnormal liver test results higher than 2\u00d7 ULN. The increase in GGT at admission appeared to be more pronounced, with 53 (12.71%) having 1-2\u00d7 ULN, 5 (1.2%) having 2-3\u00d7 ULN, and 10 (2.4%) having more than 3\u00d7 ULN (Table 1) .

            "text": "Our study is the first, and perhaps most comprehensive, to describe the liver test results in patients with COVID-19. Compared to patients with normal liver tests at admission, those who had abnormal liver test results, especially in hepatocyte type or mixed type, had significantly higher risks of developing severe pneumonia. As almost all patients had liver tests at admission, liver test abnormalities can be used as a predictor for the severity of the disease. More than 90% of patients with abnormal liver tests were mild at admission (i.e., with <2\u00d7 ULN), and about 24% of them developed increased ALT and GGT levels to substantially more than 3\u00d7 ULN during hospitalization. However, the increase in AST and TBIL to more than 3\u00d7 ULN were moderate (12% and 15%, respectively), and no increase in ALP was found. Patients with elevated liver enzymes classified as hepatocyte type at admission or during hospitalization had significantly higher odds of progressing to severe COVID-19. After admission, the use of drugs, especially lopinavir and ritonavir, was the most important risk factor for liver damage. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir increased the odds of liver injury by 4-fold. Thus, it is suggested to closely monitor patients who used these particular therapies, especially in those who had abnormal liver test results at admission. The liver test abnormality rate in our study was higher than previously reported and only a small portion had underlying liver disease, suggesting that liver damage in patients with coronavirus infection might be directly caused by the viral infection of liver cells. 22 Two recent studies showed that ACE2 was the key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, 23, 24 which was mainly localized in the heart, kidney, and testes, and expressed at a low level in many other tissues, especially in the colon and lung. 25 Another recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes and cause liver damage, 7 which may partially explain the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the liver test dysfunction in our patients. Moreover, the use of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs might also affect liver tests. All patients in this study with hypertension used ACEinhibitors/ARBs at admission, subsequently, these medications may have influenced their abnormal liver tests. However, although we found that those receiving ACE-inhibitors/ARBs appeared to have a higher percentage of abnormal liver tests at admission (15.6-28.6% vs. 11.1%), the difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, we excluded these 58 patients with hypertension at admission and found that the prevalence of abnormal liver function tests remained similar (from 46% to 44%), suggesting that the influence of ACE-Is/ARBs drugs on liver tests at admission, if any, should be minor. Moreover, our study showed that patients treated with ACE-inhibitors/ARBs were not at increased odds of progressing to severe disease compared to patients taking other antihypertensive drugs. The prevalence of abnormal liver tests increased to 76% during hospitalization, which could be due to a more frequent examination (i.e., every 3 to 5 days) and drugs used during hospitalization. Note that 84% of patients used lopinavir/ritonavir during hospitalization, drugs which have been reported to cause liver damage and affect liver tests. 26 In our study, GGT was elevated substantially at admission and increased to a much higher level during hospitalization, whereas the increase in ALP was not pronounced. Both GGT and ALP were considered as \"cholangiocyte-related enzymes\". However, besides the bile duct, ALP is present in bone, intestine, kidney, and placenta, while GGT is mainly distributed in the cell membranes of many tissues including kidneys, bile duct, pancreas, gallbladder, spleen, heart, brain, and seminal vesicles. Hence, for bile duct injury, ALP is more sensitive than GGT. For patients with elevated GGT level and normal ALP, drug-induced liver injury and injury in other organs should be considered, but cannot be classified into the bile duct type. 27, 28 We observed a substantial increase in the incidence of liver injury after admission. In our study, about 90% patients with abnormal liver test results were mild at admission (i.e., with <2\u00d7 ULN), and more than 10% of them had increased levels of ALT and GGT (more than 3\u00d7 ULN) during hospitalization. The increases in AST and TBIL to more than 3\u00d7 ULN were moderate (about 6% and 3%, respectively), and no increase in ALP was found. For these patients, there were few other factors affecting liver test abnormality, such as underlying liver disease and drug usage, hence, we speculate that the disease itself is the most likely cause of this change. However, for hospitalized patients, more attention should be paid to drug-induced liver damage.",

The 2 cases of liver failure occurring in patients with sepsis and multiple organ failure also support this hypothesis. (1): Patients who had raised ALT and/or AST more than 3\u00d7 the ULN were classified as hepatocyte type; patients who had raised ALP or GGT twice the ULN were classified as cholangiocytes type; and patients who had a raised combination of both ALT/AST more 3 time the ULN and ALP/GGT twice the ULN were classified as mixed type. Abnormality type (2): patients were classified as hepatocyte type when the AST/ALT activity was higher than the ALP/GGT activity, and were classified as cholangiocyte type when the reverse occurred. As it may take years to develop new agents specifically for SARS-CoV-2, an efficient approach is to test whether existing antiviral drugs are effective in treating the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study showed that the use of lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with 4\u00d7 higher odds of liver injury. Lopinavir/ritonavir have previously been used to treat patients with SARS 23 and HIV 24 infections in China and are widely used (84%) in our patients with COVID-19. However, given the potentially high risk of liver injury, efficacy and safety of these therapies warrant further investigation. Moreover, in China, drug-induced liver impairment is most frequently reported with antibiotics and Chinese herbal medicine. 29 The present study suggested that the use of antibiotics, but not Chinese herbal medicine, was associated with liver injury in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the multivariable regression model. Although the results from the IPW model did not show statistical significance, it is also important for clinicians to be aware of these cases, which may need to be carefully monitored.",

            "text": "The present study has some limitations. First, as patients of this study were from a single, large city in China, these findings cannot be generalized to rural communities or other regions of varying epidemiological characteristics. Second, as very few patients died from the disease in our study (only 3 patients died during the course of the study), the potential influence of liver abnormality or injury on mortality cannot be assessed. As new cases are emerging globally, further studies in large patient series are warranted. In addition, data on other causes of liver injury in the patients progressing to liver injury, such as herbal medicines or other drugs used as self-medication before developing COVID-19 pneumonia, were not available from our patients. However, since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in China in December 2019, discussion about COVID-19 has spread rapidly on the Internet and has quickly become the focus of worldwide attention. Shenzhen is one of the most developed cities in China and access to the Internet is widespread, meaning many in the population would have a high degree of awareness of the disease. Most (i.e., >70%) patients went to the hospital within 5 days after the onset disease symptoms and rarely used over-the-counter medicine to self-treat because medical insurance is widely available in Shenzhen. Hence, although the data on herbs and other drugs used as self-medication before developing COVID-19 pneumonia was not available in our study, their influence on the results might not be substantial. Lastly, we did not apply the definition of drug-induced liver injury from the European Association for the Study of the Liver clinical practice guidelines, 35 as currently there was no evidence indicating that the abnormal liver injury during hospitalization was fully induced by the drugs used.",

Patients with abnormal liver tests were at increased risk of progressing to severe disease. The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, and should be monitored and evaluated frequently. (A) (20\u00d7) There was no obvious inflammation in the portal area. The structure of interlobular bile duct, interlobular vein and interlobular artery was clear; the hepatocytes in the interlobular were arranged orderly, and a few hepatocytes were observed slightly vesicular steatosis and watery degeneration (possibly related to ischemia and hypoxia). (B) (40\u00d7) The hepatocytes were observed slightly vesicular steatosis and watery degeneration, and a few inflammatory cells (neutrophils, plasma cells and Kupffer cells) were found in hepatic sinuses.",
