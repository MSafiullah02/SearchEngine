As noted, disease surveillance and care of migrants and refugees are becoming increasingly important additions to this practice. The pretravel consultation begins with an evaluation of the health and immunization status of the traveler and concludes with an assessment and a plan based on the itinerary-based risk. A growing number of decision-support resources and tools are available to facilitate this process, including government travel advice sites, Travax, Tropimed, and Gideon. Prevention of individual diseases is addressed by a combination of patient education, vaccination, provision of chemoprophylaxis, use of methods to avoid insect exposure, food and water precautions, provision of medication for self-treatment of certain illnesses, and provision of travel and evacuation insurance if desired. Individual recommendations are based on epidemiologically determined likelihood of injury and disease occurrence in an individual area and the individual traveler\u2019s health, experience, health belief model, and tolerance of risk.15 At times, pretravel consultation may provide a cogent argument for travel postponement, as with pregnant women planning travel to malarial areas.",

The pretravel history includes exploration and documentation of the individual\u2019s purposes for travel, specific travel itinerary, and duration, including discussion of planned or possible stopovers and side trips, with attention to seasonal and locale-specific variances in risk of infection and injury. For example, an individual traveling on business to Rio de Janeiro might wish to take a side trip to the Amazon, which will require additional counseling, vaccinations, and prophylaxis. The types of accommodation and likely styles of eating and drinking during the trip should be discussed relative to risk. Planned activities should also be reviewed relative to risk, for example, spelunking, white water rafting, fresh water and salt water swimming and diving, trekking in remote areas, and potential domestic and wild animal exposure. What degree of interaction will the traveler have with local populations? Will the traveler be engaged in agriculture, wildlife biology, construction, or local medical or humanitarian work? Will the individual travel to an area of unrest or conflict? Current outbreaks of disease and areas of violence and conflict, described on State Department, World Health Organization (WHO), CDC, Pan American Health Organization, and ProMed sites, also play important roles in pretravel counseling.",

Travelers are counseled about the potential differences in influenza risk and likelihood of vaccine efficacy when traveling in semitropical and tropical areas than in temperate areas and between the northern and southern hemispheres. Because of the infrequent but continued presence of wild poliovirus and clinical polio in developing countries, the CDC currently recommends that adult travelers who have received a primary polio vaccination series with either inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) or oral polio vaccine (OPV) should receive a single lifetime additional dose of IPV.19 The CDC currently recommends that all adults (younger than 65 years) should receive 1 dose of Tdap (tetanus-diptheria-pertussis vaccine) as one of their recommended 10-year boosters, which is particularly relevant to the traveler because of the increased likelihood of exposure to diphtheria and pertussis in developing countries. Individuals born before 1958 are generally considered immune to measles and mumps. All individuals born after 1957 should have documentation of 1 or more doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine unless they have medical contraindication, laboratory evidence of immunity to each of the 3 diseases, or documentation of provider-diagnosed measles or mumps. Individuals who received inactivated (killed) measles vaccine or measles vaccine of unknown type during the period from 1963 to 1967 should be revaccinated with 2 doses of measles vaccine. Because of a significant risk of measles exposure, a second MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first, is recommended for adults who work in outbreak settings or in health care settings in developing countries or plan to travel internationally.20\n",

Which vaccinations an individual will need depends on several factors, including the traveler\u2019s age and health status, previous immunization, the destination, the season of the year the individual will be traveling, the length of time an individual will spend in a specific area, whether a traveler will be spending time in rural areas, what activities the individual will engage in,21, 22, 23 and whether the destination is currently experiencing disease outbreaks. For example, rabies preexposure prophylaxis is recommended for those travelers who will spend a significant time outdoors, especially in rural areas, or who anticipate activities such as spelunking, cycling, camping, or hiking. Rabies vaccination is also recommended for travelers with significant occupational risk (such as veterinarians); for long-term travelers and expatriates living in areas of significant exposure risk; and for travelers involved in any activities that might bring them into direct contact with bats, carnivores, and other mammals. Children are considered at higher risk for rabies exposure because they tend to interact with animals, may receive more bites, and may not report bites or exposures.

Malaria is primarily transmitted by the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, although transmission is also documented via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and needle sharing. Anopheles spp are evening feeders; therefore, transmission occurs primarily from dusk to dawn. Annually, malaria causes 350 to 500 million infections and 1 million deaths globally, largely affecting children in areas of Central and South America, parts of the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania (see Fig. 1\nfor a map of at-risk areas for malaria transmission. Regularly updated maps are available on the WHO and CDC Websites [www.cdc.gov/malaria/map/index.html]). Thirty thousand travelers from Europe and North America contract malaria each year, with 10,745 cases reported in US residents to the CDC from 1997 to 2006. Of the reported cases in the United States, 59.3% were acquired in sub-Saharan Africa, 13.9% in Asia, 13.3% in the Caribbean and Central and South America, and 0.03% in Oceania. However, when considered in the context of volume of travel to these locations, the regions of highest estimated relative risk are West Africa and Oceania; other parts of Africa, South Asia, and South America are felt to have moderate risk, whereas, portions of Central America and other parts of Asia are of relatively lower risk. Individual traveler risk varies substantially by region, including areas of differing altitude, urban versus rural travel, by season, and between travelers.24 The level of risk presented by a particular itinerary decides whether it may be appropriate to recommend mosquito avoidance methods only, mosquito avoidance methods and chemoprophylaxis, or no specific interventions. Even short exposure, such as that experienced by cruise ship passengers, may pose risk in an area of intense transmission.",

            "text": "Malaria vaccination development has faced numerous challenges since the initial cloning of malaria antigens in the early 1980s. At present, several questions remain regarding vaccine mode of action in this parasite\u2019s complex and incompletely understood infection biology, efficacy, dosage schedules, and potential duration of effect. Resources for research funding are relatively scarce. Goals of vaccine development have been to either prevent blood-stage infection completely via destruction of sporozoites before they enter the liver or kill the infected hepatocytes (preerythrocytic vaccine) or to limit parasite growth and density in the blood compartment via destruction of the infected erythrocytes (blood-stage vaccine), with the goal of providing a durable immune response similar in efficacy to that induced by natural infection. Significant antigenic diversity has been a barrier to the development of immunity in both the preerythrocytic and blood stages of parasite development. Although immunity to severe life-threatening disease is evidently acquired early in childhood in areas of intense malaria transmission, clearly demonstrating clinical immunity, vaccine trials have been limited by the lack of an immunologic correlate of effectiveness in vaccinated individuals.26, 27 An ideal vaccine should be directed against several novel antigens, perhaps T-cell targets, expressed in several stages of parasite development, that are likely to be highly conserved in sequence and robustly recognized by vaccine-induced immune response.28, 29\n",

Infection with DENV causes a spectrum of clinical illness, ranging from a usually mild, acute self-limited febrile illness, dengue fever, to life-threatening hemorrhagic and capillary leak syndromes of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). DENV causes an estimated 25 million to 100 million cases of dengue fever and 250,000 cases of DHF yearly worldwide. 2.5 billion people are estimated to be at risk for infection (Fig. 2\n, a world map indicating regions with known risk of dengue is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/dengue). The United States has witnessed the return of autochthonous transmission since 1980, initially described in Texas, but now reported in Hawaii, Florida, and Puerto Rico. Geosentinel data, collected on 6 continents, showed dengue fever to be the second most common cause of systemic febrile illness, excluding diarrheal diseases, in returning travelers and the most common cause in travelers returning from the Caribbean, South America, Southeast Asia, and South Central Asia.15\n",

            "text": "In brief, the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS reflects a complex interaction of viral virulence determinants and the host immune system. Infection with one serotype of DENV renders the individual immune to that strain for life but with only transient immunity to other strains, and individuals are at risk for DHF/DSS with secondary DENV infection with another strain. An increased risk of DHF/DSS also occurs in children within their first year of life when born to DENV-immune mothers. These observations served as the basis for the hypothesis of antibody-dependent immune enhancement (ADE) in DHF/DSS, which is supported by the findings of increased peak viremia in severe DHF/DSS, and ADE is seen in vitro in DENV-infected monocytes. A pathologic cytokine response, including increased levels of interferon \u03b3, interleukin 10, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b3, after CD8+ cell activation is thought to contribute to the capillary leak syndrome seen with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Most protective antibodies are directed against the surface E glycoprotein of the virus. Antibodies to the M and NS1 proteins also have been shown to demonstrate some protection. At present, there is no established dengue immune correlate of infection.",

Vaccine development has been hampered by the absence of a validated animal model of dengue infection. Based on the current understanding of virus-immune system interactions, an effective vaccine should produce high titers of neutralizing antibodies against all 4 strains. Failure to achieve this potentially increases the individual\u2019s risk of severe DHF/DSS if challenged by a natural virus infection with a different strain. Several tetravalent live attenuated virus candidate vaccines are in development (see Table 2\nfor a list of current candidate DENV vaccines). Tetravalent serologic responses have been observed in some individuals during trials; whereas each portion of the tetravalent vaccines has not been shown to elicit high titer responses, monovalent vaccines were shown to elicit higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than when they were combined in multivalent combinations, and many individuals mount insufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies despite multiple immunizations. Alternative vaccine candidates include subunit-based vaccines containing purified proteins or DNA plasmids, which have been shown to produce protective antibodies in mice at fairly low neutralizing titers; live attenuated vaccines, including dengue and dengue-yellow fever chimeras; and nonreplicating vaccines, including virus-like particles, DNA vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines. Long-lasting protective neutralizing antibodies are elicited against a specific serotype, but they have been shown to be poorly cross-reactive against infection with another serotype. Similar problems were encountered in the development of OPV, and the imbalance in seroconversion was overcome by the administration of 3 doses of the multivalent vaccine.33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 A Sanofi Pasteur tetravalent live attenuated chimeric yellow fever-dengue vaccine has entered hase 3 trials (NCT01134263). Phase 2 trials suggest that the vaccine is safe and immunogenic.35 Preliminary results of an ongoing phase 2b efficacy and safety trial in Thai children are expected to be available by the end of 2012.",

It is usually self-limited, consisting of several days of watery diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by low-grade fever, headache, malaise, nausea, and abdominal cramping. Thirty to seventy percent of travelers may be affected during a 2-week trip, largely depending on the travel destination. The highest attack rates are seen in travelers to Asia, Africa, Mexico, Latin America, and the Middle East. Intermediate risk is seen with travel to the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, the former Soviet States, southern Europe, Israel, and South Africa. Travel to the developed nations in North America, Europe, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia provides the lowest attack rates.39, 40 A recent study examining the Geosentinel data found that female travelers seem to be at disproportionately increased risk for acute diarrhea, chronic diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome than male travelers.41 Contrary to popular belief, traveler\u2019s diarrhea does not only occur in travelers from temperate, economically developed countries to semitropical and tropical developing countries, as evidenced by the serious recent outbreak of shiga-toxin\u2013producing Escherichia coli serogroup O104:H4 (STEC) with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in northern Germany. Any traveler may experience an acute intestinal upset, as this is increasingly recognized as a disturbance of the normal ecology of an individual\u2019s gastrointestinal tract by exposures to new water, foods, and spices as well as to microorganisms. Gastrointestinal dysfunction, in the form of irritable bowel syndrome, may persist in up to 13% of individuals who develop traveler\u2019s diarrhea.42, 43 Other postinfectious sequelae include Guillain-Barre and reactive arthritis.",

Symptoms may result from the ingestion of preformed toxins, such as that seen with Bacillus cereus, staphylococcal food poisoning, and botulism. In general, bacteria are the most commonly identified cause of acute diarrheal disease in travelers visiting tropical and developing countries (80%\u201390%), with risk modified by geographic region, time of year, and the presence of local outbreaks. In many cases, no causative organism may be identified. Enterotoxigenic strains of E coli (ETEC), which may carry both heat-labile and heat-stable plasmid-coded enterotoxins, are the most commonly identified bacterial cause. Oral cholera vaccine produces some protection against traveler\u2019s diarrhea, because it elicits antibody production against the B subunit of cholera toxin, which cross-reacts with the heat-labile toxin of ETEC. In the past decade, Campylobacter species, most commonly Campylobacter jejuni, have become increasingly common pathogenic agents of traveler\u2019s diarrhea. These seem to have seasonal and geographic variance, with the peak incidence in the United States in summer months, whereas the peak incidence in other regions, such as North Africa, occurs in winter months. Other bacteria implicated in traveler\u2019s diarrhea include enteroadherent E coli; Salmonella spp, including S typhi; Shigella spp; Yersinia enterocolitica; Aeromonas; Vibrio spp, including V parahemolyticus, V cholera, and V vulnificus; and Plesiomonas shigelloides. Norovirus is a common cause of traveler\u2019s diarrhea (10%\u201315% cases), notably in several cruise-ship outbreaks. Rotavirus and astroviruses are less common pathogens in adults (5%\u201314%). Hepatitis A and E also cause gastrointestinal illness in travelers. Hepatitis E is of particular concern in pregnant women as it may lead to severe, life-threatening illness. Most parasites implicated in traveler\u2019s diarrhea are protozoa, including Giardia lamblia, and less commonly Cryptosporidium spp, Cyclospora cayetenensis, Isospora belli, Entamoeba histolytica, and occasionally Dientamoeba fragilis. Helminths are also reported to cause diarrheal disease in travelers. Ingested plant, fish, and shellfish toxin-related illness, including Ackee poisoning, Scombroid, Ciguatera, paralytic, neurotoxic, and diarrheal shellfish poisonings, may also cause gastrointestinal disease in travelers.",
