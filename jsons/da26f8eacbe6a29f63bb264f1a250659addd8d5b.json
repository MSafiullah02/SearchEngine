Two nonoverlapping open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. The largest, encoding a polypeptide of 382 amino acids (relative molecular mass (Mr) 43 483), was shown to be the viral nucleoprotein gene. The second ORF, found 3' to the larger ORF, encodes a polypeptide of 78 amino acids (M, 9068) which has yet to be assigned to a viral product. The nucleoprotein gene was expressed in yeast cells under the control of two types of yeast promoters: the constitutive PGK promoter, and the inducible GAL1 promoter. Yeast cells containing recombinant plasmids, with the nucleoprotein gene in the correct orientation, produced a polypeptide of M, 47000, identical to the viral product, that reacted with a specific monoclonal antibody.",

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) Is a coronavirus that causes gastroenteritis in pigs, resulting in a high mortality among neonates. TGEV is composed of a capped polyadenylated single-stranded RNA genome of M, 6.8x10^ or 20 kb in length (Garwes et al.. 1975; Dennis and Brian, 1981) and three major structural polypeptides: a surface glycoprotein (spike or peplomer protein) with a monomeric M. 200 000, a giycosylated integral membrane protein observed as a series of potypeptides of M, 28000-31 000, and a basic phos-phorylated protein {the nucleoprotein) of M, 47000 associated with the viral RNA (Garwes and Pocock, 1975) . Infection of susceptible cells with TGEV results in the synthesis of a 'nested\" set of subgenomic mRNA species with common 3' termini but different extensions in the 5' direction, a phenomenon also observed with other coronaviruses such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, Stern and Kennedy. 1980) , though the size and number of the mRNA species vary with the virus. TGEV appears to have, in addition to the genomic sized RNA species, four major (11.2.3.9,2.6 and 1.7 kb) and two low abundant (3.0 and 0.7 kb) mRNA species (Britton etal., 1986; Jacobs etal., 1986) .",

Out of 417 colonies transformed with recombinant DNA, 36 contained DNA that hybridized to ^^P-labelled TGEV poly{A)-containing RNA. Three recombinant plasmids, shown to contain cDNA inserts of 1.5 kbp and designated pTS13-2, pTS15-1 and pTSi 5-2, were labelled with p^S]-dATP by nick translation and hybridized to glyoxylated TGEV mRNA species separated on 1 % agarose gels as described in Experimentat procedures. All three recombinant plasmids were found to hybridize to all TGEV RNA species. In contrast, other recombinant plasmids derived from different mRNA species only reacted to one or more TGEV RNA species. This observation indicated that pTSi3-2, pTS15-1 and pTS15-2 contained regions of cDNA complementary to regions present on all the TGEV nested' mRNA species. This phenomenon can only occur if the cDNA was derived from the 3' end of the RNA and since the sizes of the cDNA inserts were about 1.5 kbp, then most of the 1.7 kb mRNA species was copied. Plasmid pTS15-1 was purified and a restriction map constructed {Fig. 1A).

The cDNA was translated in all six reading frames, of which only the translation in the virussense strand revealed any open reading frames. The longest open reading frame, initiating from the ATG at position 38, of 1149 bp overlapped both cDNA inserts and encoded a potypeptide of 382 amino acids, with an M^ of 43483.

The smaller open reading frame should be present on an mRNA species of 0.7 kb; the smallest mRNA species detected In TGEV-infected cells is the 0.7 kb low-abundance species (Britton ef at., 1986) , showing that a polypeptide of M, 9068 could be produced by this mRNA species. 1986). The polypeptide sequence has three areas of homology with the nucleoproteins from IBV (Boursnell et al., 1985) and MHV (Skinner and Siddell, 1983) as analysed by dot matrix (Fig. 3 ). Previous work (Britton et at., 1987) showed that antibodies raised against a purified chimaeric protein, produced from the pTS15-1 H/ndlll fragment (1-38 kbp) fused to the 3' end of the tacZ gene, immunoprecipitated TGEV nucleoprotein. This confirmed that the cDNA carried on pTS15-1 contained most of the nucleoprotein gene.",

Yeast cells transformed with pYNP1 grown in the presence of 2% glucose or 2% galactose and cells transformed with pYNGI and pYNG3 grown in the presence of 2% galactose but not 2% glucose reacted with the monoclonal antibody.

The nucleoprotein gene cassette cloned in the opposite orientation did not produce the polypeptide of M, 47000 or any other polypeptide detectable with DA3 under any conditions. Expression from the GAL1 promoter appeared to be more efficient than from the PGK promoter. The presence of the PGK termination sequence following the nucleoprotein gene under the control of the GAL 1 promoter did not seem to increase the efficiency of expression.

The 10-base sequence, TGGAAGAGCT, observed by Kapke and Brian (1986) , found 69 bp from the poly(A) tail, is similar to that found in both IBV (81 bp from the po!y(A) tail) and MHV (82 bp from the poly(A) tail) and may be a recognitioti site or binding site involved in the synthesis of the negative RNA strand (Boursnell ef al.. 1985; Kapke and Brian, 1986) . Knowledge of the amino acid sequences of gene products from different viral strains can help to locate domains in the proteins conserved for their structure and function. Comparison of all the genes between virulent and aviruient strains may be useful for the identification of sequences involved in the pathogenicity of the virus. The amino acid sequence of the nucieoprotein from FS772/70 and Purdue strains of TGEV differ by 2.1% and most of the changes are relatively conservative. However, the change at base 636 results in an amino acid substitution of cysteine for strain FS772/70 to arginine for Purdue, There are three areas of homology between the nucleoproteins of TGEV (strains FS772/70 or Purdue), IBV (Beaudette) and MHV (JHM) (Figs. 2 and 3) , indicating that all three coronavirus subgroups share common ancestry. The areas of homology. shown in Fig. 2 , between TGEV amino acid residues 65-123 and 257-291 appear to be present to a similar extent in the three viruses. However, the homology in the region between amino acid residues 155-190 is much less between IBV than MHV, indicating that TGEV more closely resembles MHV. Dot matrix analysis shows that this region between TGEV strains FS772/70 and Purdue has multiple repetitions (Fig. 3) , probably resulting from a series of alignments of serine-arginine repeats, which could be a site for interaction with genomic RNA. There is no detectable homology between the nucleotide sequences of the nucleoprotein genes of the three viruses. This suggests that the three regions of protein homology may be involved in either RNA interaction or the formation of the correct conformation for interaction. There is no antigenic homoiogy between the nucleoproteins of TGEV, IBV and MHV (Pedersen et al., 1978) , suggesting that the antigenic sites are present in the non-homologous regions. Motz ef al. (1986) have shown that major antigenic sites on the Epstein-Barr virus 138 kD early protein occurred at hydrophilic p-turns. Determination of the secondary structure of TGEV nucleoprotein using the PREDICT program and the hydrophilicity of the primary structure showed that the areas of non-homology with IBV and MHV contained potential hydrophilic p-turns, indicating that the areas responsible for antigenicity may fall within these regions. None of the amino acid substitutions between TGEV FS772/70 and Purdue strains fall within the two main homology regions, except for a conservative serine/ threonine substitution at amino acid position 262, which indicates that the differences between the nucieoproteins of the two strains will probably not be responsible for the difference in the pathogenicity of the two strains, though there may be antigenic variations.",

Substitution of asparagine for aspartate at position 30 of the gene results in the introduction of a potential A/-giycosylation site in the FS772/70 strain as compared to the Purdue strain. To date, no product has been identified in either infected cells or virions that corresponds to this polypeptide. However, Garwes (unpublished results) has detected a polypeptide of M, 12000-14000, produced in infected cells, which does not appear to be incorporated into virions. The polypeptide is probably similar to the polypeptide of Mr 17000 identified by Wesley and Woods (1986) and later sized as M, 14000 (Wesley and Woods, 1987) produced by the Purdue strain of TGEV. The presence of a potential glycosylation site at amino acid 30 of FS772/70, which may add up to 2000 to the molecular weight of the polypeptide, and the hydrophobicity of the molecule may cause the difference in the molecular weight between the theoretical and observed values. Three oligopeptides have been synthesized for the production of antibodies in order to probe infected cells and virions for the presence of the polypeptide of M, 9068.",
