            "text": "Coronaviruses isolated from several species consist of a group of large, enveloped, single plus stranded RNA viruses, and these viruses are earlier known to cause acute rhinitis and diarrhea in humans (Drosten et al. 2003a; Chen et al. 2020). A human coronavirus named SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) was associated with the SARS outbreak in the year 2002\u20132003 (Zhong et al. 2003; Drosten et al. 2003b; Fouchier et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003). Similarly 10 year after SARS outbreak, another deadly human coronavirus [Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)] emerged in the Middle East nations (Zaki et al. 2012). Recently, a new coronavirus named 2019-nCoV (belonging to the family Coronaviridae and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) has erupted in the region of Wuhan (China) with severe respiratory tract infections in human. This virus is distinct from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV; animal-to-human transmission has been considered as the origin of this outbreak, as most of the patients had a history to visit a local fish and wild animal market in Wuhan during the epidemic (Chan et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020). Animal-to-human and inter-human transmissions of this viral infection through respiratory route were established by certain group of scientists (Lu et al. 2020; Ji et al. 2020). Patient isolation and accurate timely diagnosis are the hallmarks to control this new epidemic. It is also important to acquire knowledge from the history and evolution of coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis and its relation with different natural hosts of these viruses can help one to estimate its genetic variability which in turn has important applications for the viral etiopathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and vaccine development.",

The era of human coronaviruses began in the year 1965 when Tyrrell and Bynoe observed that they could serially sub-passage a virus in tissue culture while doing research on human participants at the Common Cold Unit close to Salisbury, UK; they named this virus as B814 (Tyrrell and Bynoe 1966). Their experiment demonstrated that common colds could be transmitted by nasal secretion that did not contain rhinoviruses, and further in vitro experiments of nasal swabs from these participants had been inoculated onto organ cultures obtained from respiratory tract cell lines. They discovered the presence of enveloped RNA viruses with the feature morphology of coronaviruses similar to the previously defined infectious bronchitis virus. They were unable to grow the virus in tissue culture at that time. Subsequently in the year 1966, Hamre and Procknow succeeded in growing a new virus (229E) of unexpected tissue culture properties from a medical graduate with symptoms of common cold (Hamre and Procknow 1966).",

(1967a) had used the similar technique of Tyrrell and Bynoe to extract the multiple strains of ether-susceptible agents from human volunteers. These viruses were designated OC as they were grown in the organ culture of respiratory tract. In the year 1967, Almeida and Tyrrell were able to demonstrate the similar morphology of B814 and IBV under the electron microscopy of the fluid obtained from the inoculated organ culture. The virus particles were of size around 80\u2013150 nm, pleomorphic, enveloped with membrane coating, and multiple club-shaped surface projections (Almeida and Tyrrell 1967). All of these (229E, OC, B814, and IBV) along with the virus causing mouse hepatitis and transmissible gastroenteritis infection of swine had a similar morphology under electron microscopy (McIntosh et al. 1967b; Witte et al. 1968) (Fig. 12.1). The new group of these viruses was named coronavirus in 1968 (corona means the crown-like structure with surface projection), reflecting their morphology in the electron microscope, and further Coronaviridae was accepted as their family name in 1975 (Tyrrell et al. 1975).\n",

SARS emerged in the late 2002 from South East Asia with an epicenter of China and spread expeditiously all over the world. Taking after the acknowledgement that SARS was caused by a new human coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it was found to be more pathogenic and causes serious respiratory complications (Li et al. 2005; Ren et al. 2008; Peiris et al. 2003). The genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV was comfortably achieved as it had the capacity to grow readily in tissue culture. Two other modern human coronaviruses, NL63 and HKU-1, were also found in association with respiratory disease.",

Toroviruses and coronaviruses are the two representative genera of the family Coronaviridae; they have been further classified in subfamily Coronavirinae. On the basis of rooted and unrooted genetic trees and partial nucleotide sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, subfamily Coronavirinae has been recognized and classified into four genera\u2014alpha (\u03b1) coronavirus, beta (\u03b2) coronavirus, gamma (\u03b3) coronavirus, and delta (\u03b4) coronavirus (Woo et al. 2009, 2012a). The \u03b1 coronaviruses and \u03b2 coronaviruses infect only warm-blooded animals. The \u03b3 coronaviruses and \u03b4 coronaviruses infect birds, but some of them can also infect mammals. Phylogenetic relationship of various human and animal coronaviruses and the list of known coronaviruses are shown in Fig. 12.2 and Tables 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3, respectively. Infection with \u03b1 coronaviruses and \u03b2 coronaviruses leads to respiratory disorders in human and gastrointestinal disorders in animals (Su et al. 2016; Forni et al. 2017; Gorbalenya et al. 2006). Currently available genetic sequence databases of all human coronaviruses reveal with its animal origins: Viruses of the family Coronaviridae are listed, with their abbreviations and natural animal reservoir (Cavanagh 1997) (Table 12.2). Domestic animals can act as an intermediate host to transmit these viruses from their reservoir host to the humans. Sometimes domestic animal may acquire infection with closely related zoonotic coronaviruses (Woo et al. 2009, 2012a). Extensive research study on the source of infection of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has found bat as a reservoir, and it has laid to the better understanding of coronavirus microbiology. At present, seven species of \u03b1 coronavirus and four species of \u03b2 coronavirus have been identified only in bats (Su et al. 2016; Lau et al. 2013; Perlman and Netland 2009; Woo et al. 2012b; Graham et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2015; de Wit et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2017).\n\n\n\n",
