Of particular interest is the distinction between effects that influence the reversible versus the irreversible step. The former is influenced by noncovalent interactions between inhibitor and enzyme. The latter may also be influenced by such effects, as they may orient the inhibitor in the right arrangement. However, it also relies on the chemical reactivity of the electrophilic warhead which is influenced by substituent effects. Such information can be provided by chemoassays. To elucidate such effects for the inhibition potency of three\u2010membered heterocycles we employed a thiophenol assay. It proved to be a good model for the active site of cysteine proteases, as it represents a rather acidic thiol (pK\na=7.4\u20137.8) with half the concentration being deprotonated at the pH used (pH 7.6).13c,d In the work reported herein this assay was applied to gain insight into the reactivity of the studied etacrynic acid derivatives.

In the present context it involves the formation of a covalent bond between a thiol residue (e.g., of the cysteine residue of the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro) and the electrophilic building block of the inhibitor. Models that aim to describe this step in all details must account for the influence of the protein and the solvent environment. This can be achieved with quantum mechanical/molecular modeling (QM/MM) approaches that take enzyme and solvent explicitly into account. They are even able to describe effects such as regio\u2010 or stereoselectivity of the inhibition process.20 However, as shown recently by investigations into the inhibition of papain\u2010like proteases,13 valuable insights into the influence of the substitution pattern of the warhead are already possible from simpler models. These mimic all important parts of the considered system by truncated model compounds in combination with a continuum model such as COSMO.21 These models approximate the cysteine residue by a methyl thiolate, while the environment is modeled either by two water molecules (pK\ns\u224815) to mimic a low proton\u2010donating ability of the environment, or by two ammonium ions (pK\ns\u22489.3) to simulate a higher proton\u2010donating ability. These explicit solvent molecules were employed in combination with the continuum model COSMO which accounts for the overall polarizability of the solvent and the protein environment. From the inhibitor, only the electrophilic warhead and its directly attached substituents were taken into account. Information about the kinetics and thermodynamics of the irreversible step of inhibition were obtained through potential energy surfaces of the inhibition process which were computed by employing the B3LYP/TZVP//BLYP/TZVP level of theory. Because such approaches are considerably less expensive than QM/MM computations they allowed a scan of a large number of substituents to test changes in the inhibition potencies of epoxides and aziridines. Such model calculations are also important to distinguish between influences of the enzyme environment and inherent effects resulting from the electronic structure of the inhibitor itself. That the prediction of the computations could be proven experimentally underscores the reliability of the simple approach.13\n",

For the reactions under physiological conditions, thiols are present in protonated (R\u2010SH) and deprotonated (R\u2010S\u2212) form, but as discussed below, only the reactivity of the thiolate seems to be sufficiently high for an efficient attack at the \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated carbonyl moiety. Hence, the proton must be transferred to a proton acceptor, that is, a base\u2010catalyzed reaction has to take place. For the resulting thiolate the reaction can proceed along two pathways. In the direct addition mechanism the thiolate attacks C3 (Figure 2) and at the same time the proton is transferred from the base to C2 (direct E2\u2010like addition). If the proton is instead transferred to the carbonyl oxygen atom, the enol form of the 1,4\u2010addition is obtained. A comparison between both pathways was computationally performed by Weinstein and co\u2010workers,22 who studied the addition of ammonia to \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated carbonyl compounds. They computed a direct addition as well as the 1,4\u2010addition. However, they did not consider the base\u2010catalyzed reactions discussed in Figure 2. In contrast, for the direct addition they assumed an intermolecular proton transfer from the ammonium group to C2. For the 1,4\u2010addition an intramolecular proton transfer from the nitrogen atom to the carbonyl oxygen was considered. They found that in such cases the 1,4\u2010addition is favored over direct addition. Both reactions are catalyzed by a single water molecule, but 1,4\u2010addition remains the favorable reaction course. For acrolein the barrier of the 1,4\u2010addition is \u223c70 kJ mol\u22121 lower than the corresponding barrier of the direct addition (96 kJ mol\u22121 vs. 27 kJ mol\u22121). For acrylic acid the difference is only \u223c5 kJ mol\u22121 (59 kJ mol\u22121 vs. 54 kJ mol\u22121), but the 1,4\u2010addition is still favored. Tezer and Ozkan23 came to similar conclusions.",

The energy difference between the enol and the keto form was measured to \u0394H\n0=\u221243 kJ mol\u22121.24 Comparison with gas\u2010phase data show that \u0394H\n0 depends little on the surroundings, but the actual course of the reaction and the kinetics are strongly influenced.25 Recent computations reveal that the barrier of the ketonization strongly depends on the nature of a water bridge, which facilitates the proton transfer. If the bridge consists of three water molecules the computed barrier height is \u223c73 kJ mol\u22121, while a value of >210 kJ mol\u22121 is computed for the direct transfer.

As the first step, deprotonation of the thiol reactant R occurs leading to a zwitterionic state that consists of a thiolate anion H3C\u2010S\u2212 which interacts with an ammonium ion (NH4\n+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2212S\u2010CH3). In the following this state is abbreviated as S\u2212. It lies 12 kJ mol\u22121 higher than the reactants. The deprotonation process has a barrier (TS1) that is computed to 18 kJ mol\u22121. Figure 4 A shows that the shape of the potential energy curve describing the deprotonation step is nearly independent from the second reaction coordinate RCS for RCS>3 \u00c5. For smaller distances the barrier flattens. Nevertheless, such paths remain energetically less favorable than deprotonation paths with RCS>3 \u00c5 because they start from considerably higher energies. The approach of the protonated thiol to the Michael system is repulsive (Figure 4 A). The subsequent conjugated addition reaction at the C3 atom of the inhibitor proceeds to the enol intermediate E without passing a second transition state (TS2), that is, the prior deprotonation step is the rate\u2010determining step. During this reaction step, the carbonyl oxygen atom of acrolein (1) is simultaneously protonated by the proton donor ammonium. This is also shown by the PES that is obtained if r(S\u2014H) and r(O\u2014H) are varied (Figure 4 B). The whole reaction to the enol possesses an exothermicity of only \u221245 kJ mol\u22121. For the addition of the deprotonated thiolate to the Michael system, a reaction energy of \u221257 kJ mol\u22121 is predicted. The reverse reaction is, in both cases, easily possible.",

In order to study such effects we investigated the influence of various substituents of the Michael system on the relative position of the intermediates depicted in Scheme 2. The results obtained for the compounds depicted in Figure 3 are summarized in Table 1. The s\u2010cis form of acrolein (1) (Figure 5) is \u223c10 kJ mol\u22121 higher in energy than the s\u2010trans form. The corresponding barriers are very similar so that acrolein is expected to react in the s\u2010trans form. The addition of thiolate to the \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated carbonyl compound with R1=methyl possesses an additional barrier of 10\u201315 kJ mol\u22121, which was not present for acrolein. Together with the energy necessary to form the thiolate, the total barrier for reaching the enol form increases to \u223c60 kJ mol\u22121. The relative energy of the enolate is computed to \u223c50 kJ mol\u22121. Hence the ketonization is also predicted to be slower than for acrolein, but the addition of the thiolate remains the rate\u2010determining step. The increase with respect to the unsubstituted acrolein can be explained by the +I effect of the methyl group. This effect also explains why the enol cation becomes more stable by about the same degree, but it is still considerably higher in energy than the enolate. The barriers computed for the s\u2010trans and s\u2010cis isomers are virtually identical which represents an additional difference to the unsubstituted counterpart. In summary, the methyl substituent decreases the reactivity of the \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated moiety, but the overall mechanism is not expected to change.",

Furthermore, while the addition step for the s\u2010trans form possesses a barrier (TS2=59 kJ mol\u22121), no barrier for the s\u2010cis form is computed. This could result from mesomeric effects, but the phenyl group is rotated with respect to the \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated moiety so that mainly the inductive effect of the phenyl group remains. The size seems to be similar to the effects observed for R1=methyl. The differences to compound 2 result from steric effects which are mainly present in the s\u2010trans form. Going from compound 3 to 4 the +I effects should be diminished due to the electron\u2010withdrawing effects of the chlorine substituents. Such effects are observed mainly for the s\u2010trans form, for which the barrier of the addition step disappears. Furthermore, the enol and enolate forms become more stable. The steric effects strongly increase in going from compound 4 to 5. The s\u2010cis form lies even higher in energy, and the barriers of the addition step increase as well as the enolate intermediate.

This is surprising, as all agents possess \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated carbonyl derivatives as electrophilic warheads. For this unexpected finding our investigations provide two possible explanations. In some cases, for example, compound 5 or 9, the reaction energy is estimated to be only \u223c30 kJ mol\u22121. In such cases the reverse reaction is much slower than the forward reaction but may still occur. In other cases the reaction energies are sufficiently high to impede any reverse reaction. But also in such cases a reversible inhibition may occur because complicated multistep inhibition mechanisms must occur to reach the final keto form. For all compounds, base catalysis is necessary since only the thiolate is sufficiently reactive for the addition. In most cases, the second step consists of a 1,4\u2010addition leading to the enol intermediate. The final keto form is then obtained through a ketonization of the enol form. This ketonization, as shown in previous investigations, is only possible if the necessary proton transfer is catalyzed by an efficient water bridge, for example. Because such catalysis cannot take place in the active site of many enzymes, the reaction might get stuck at the enol intermediate. Alternatively, if no proton donor is available the reaction might become stuck in an enolate intermediate, which is strongly stabilized by available oxyanion holes. In such cases our computations predict considerably smaller reaction energies. Hence the reverse reaction can take place easily, and only reversible inhibition is observed. Particularly for derivatives of \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated carboxylic acids the enol form is so high in energy that a direct addition to the olefinic double bond becomes more favorable than 1,4\u2010addition. For direct addition an efficient proton donor is necessary because the reaction proceeds in an E2\u2010like manner. However, as shown by various Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures, this role could be played by histidine residues, which would also serve as the base in the first step of the overall reaction. Therefore, providing that a histidine residue can serve as an acceptor and donor and that the electronic structure of the warhead steers the reaction toward direct addition, the keto form can be reached without the ketonization process. Only in such cases is an irreversible inhibition found. In other cases the reaction proceeds only up to the enolate form and only reversible inhibition is observed.",
