These cases of pneumonia were found to be related to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, where local government agencies quickly adopted sanitation and disinfection measures.

The overall genome organization of the newly discovered CoV is similar to that of other coronaviruses. The newly sequenced virus genome encodes the open reading frames (ORFs) common to all betacoronaviruses, containing ORF1ab that encodes several enzymatic proteins, the spike\u2010surface glycoprotein (S protein), the small envelope protein (E protein), the matrix protein (M protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (N protein), as well as several nonstructural accessory proteins. Currently, the specific primers and probes for detection 2019\u2010nCoV were synthesized and fabricated against the genetic targets such as ORF1ab and N gene region. According to the gene sequencing data, Wu et al, Tao et al, and Uehara et al initially resolved the primary sequences of ten critical proteins, that is, ORF1ab polyprotein, surface glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6 protein, ORF7a protein, ORF8 protein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and ORF10 protein, and published them on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).",

In recent days, relevant basic research has made rapid progress. Xu et al showed that the 2019\u2010nCoV shared with the SARS/SARS\u2010like coronaviruses a common ancestor that resembles the bat coronavirus HKU9\u20101. Their work also pointed to the important discovery that the RBD domain of the 2019\u2010nCoV S\u2010protein supports strong interaction with human ACE2 molecules despite its sequence diversity with SARS\u2010CoV S\u2010protein and thus the 2019\u2010nCoV poses a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S\u2010protein\u2013ACE2 binding pathway.\n16\n On this basis of the structure of 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) of 2019\u2010nCoV, the joint team integrated the strategy of virtual screening and enzymology test, focused on the drug screening for the marketed drugs, as well as the self\u2010built \u201cdatabase of high\u2010yield compounds\u201d and \u201cdatabase of compounds from medicinal plants\u201d, and quickly found 30 kinds of possible treatments for 2019\u2010nCoV drugs, active natural products, and traditional Chinese medicine. A joint research team from the structural pharmacology and pharmaceutical chemistry laboratory has been working on the current outbreak of 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia and their results showed that papain\u2010like protease (PLP) encoded by coronavirus nsp3 played an important role in viral genome replication and escape from the antivirus natural immunity of the host. PLP not only has protein hydrolase activity but also has the activity of de ubiquitinase (DUB). PLP uses its protein hydrolase activity and DUB activity to evade the host's antiviral immune response and inhibit the expression of interferon through a series of molecular mechanisms. It is another enzyme besides the coronavirus 3CL hydrolase, which are important proteins necessary for human infection. To find the potential drugs to inhibit the 2019\u2010nCoV coronavirus, the research team found that the 2019\u2010nCoV PLP sequence has 86% amino acid homology with SARS\u2010CoV PLP sequence. The research team built the protein structure of 2019\u2010nCoV PLP by using homology modeling method, defined its drug\u2010binding pocket, and screened the active molecules from the existing drug compound library of ZINC, the database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products established by their own laboratory by using the computer\u2010aided structure\u2010based virtual screening method. Then, 33 potential inhibitors of 2019\u2010nCoV PLP were selected and expected to have possible anti\u20102019\u2010nCoV activity. Several scientists speculated that Remdesivir may help fight the new coronavirus. The genetic material of the RNA virus is RNA (RNA ribonucleic acid). For the replication of the RNA virus genome, most of them need intermediate synthesis, which requires virus\u2010specific polymerase (RNA dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp, or RNA dependent DNA polymerase, RdDp). These polymerases are ideal targets for the design of antiviral drugs. Remdesivir works by interfering with RdRp. It is a precursor drug of adenosine analog. After triphosphate in vivo, it is incorporated into the newly synthesized RNA chain of the virus as a substrate, and then the synthesis of the virus genome is interrupted.\n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n\n",

Using SWISS\u2010MODEL, the template was found successfully (see Figure S70). The sequence identity is more than 90% (see Figure S71).

S1 (globule) is used for receptor binding and S2 (stem) is used for membrane fusion. The specific interaction between S1 and homologous receptors can trigger the conformational change of the S2 subunit, which leads to the fusion of virus envelope and cell membrane and release of nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Receptor binding largely determines the host range and histotropism of coronavirus. Thus, the S protein should be a critical candidate for drug screening or vaccine design against 2019\u2010nCoV.\n36\n, \n37\n In addition, the cartoons of the proteins modeled in this section are shown in Figure 2.

Today's new coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS viruses, are all coronaviruses. Therefore, scientists speculate that protease inhibitors can reduce a load of new coronaviruses in patients. Protease inhibitor is a kind of drug targeting protease to treat AIDS. At present, the National Health Commission has recommended that anti\u2010AIDS drugs can be included in the trial.
