The test reports may be delayed and can often be falsely-negative and thus cannot be solely relied upon for the COVID status of the patient.6 The purpose of the testing should not be the change in the perioperative precautions which need to be the same for all patients irrespective of testing status rather it should be done for disease notification purpose and initiation early monitoring, supportive, and therapy measures related to the COVID management. Besides taking appropriate treatment and isolation measures for COVID positive patients, the surgery should be delayed until the achievement of COVID negative status or the recovery of the acute phase of infection when the surgery can not be delayed. Surgery in COVID patients has been associated with exacerbation of the COVID related illness, postoperative ICU requirement, and higher mortality and therefore should be postponed whenever feasible.7 When postponement of surgery is not feasible, least invasive procedures should be performed to minimize surgical stress.",

For elderly patients and those with additional risk factors, the patients should be discharged only after a notable period of regular monitoring and observation that suggests well-controlled comorbidities.2\n,\n7 The only rationale behind delaying the discharge is to keep such patients under observation and timely management of complications due to comorbid status.

With these stringent measures, India has to some extent been able to contain the toll of this disease with cases totaling approximately 25 thousand and around 800 deaths. Commensurate with the development worldwide, elective orthopedic surgeries have also been stopped in most of the orthopedic facilities in our country; however, only absolute emergency patients are getting operated under strict precaution and vigilance. There has undoubtedly been a renewed surge in alternative forms of orthopedic management like conservative treatment. However, we are yet to formulate any concrete guidelines to deal with preoperative patients and perioperative strategy. We are at the dawn of a new era where there will undoubtedly be substantial changes in the post-COVID world; and a pragmatic, rational, and comprehensive guideline will boost our endeavor to serve patients in a safe and efficient way.",
