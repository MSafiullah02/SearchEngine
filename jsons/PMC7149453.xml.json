Diabetes in 11 production regions of polished rice with high glycemic index (GI \u2265 70) caused the biggest reduction in health-adjusted life expectancy at birth in 21 regions in 187 countries from 1990 to 2013 [3]. The micronutrients deficiencies at the highest risk are Fe, Zn, and vitamins (VB1, VB2, VB12, and VC) [4]. The outbreak of human chronic disease is due to taste pursuit that changes a healthy diet, i.e., the ancients switched from brown rice (GI \u2264 55, high K and high micronutrients) and barley (GI \u2264 25) or its grass flour (K/Na \u2265 10) as staple foods to modern polished rice (GI \u2265 87) and wheat white flour (GI \u2265 86) with low and low micronutrients as staple foods [3, 5].",

The sustaining major foods+barley grass powder can achieve the WHO's intake target of low sodium (<2 g) with high potassium (>3.5 g) every day [8]. More than 30 functional ingredients in barley grass can combat over 20 chronic diseases, and 15 functional ingredients in barley grains may prevent 11 chronic diseases [9]. Barley enhanced the sterols accumulation through LTP2 gene action that take part in the abiotic stress reaction of mediating intracellular lipid transport [10]. Barley straw (2.0~8.0 g/L) for phenolic acid in degradation inhibited the alga (M. aeruginosa) blooms of aquatic eutrophication by cell shrinkage of metabolic activity and Chlorophyll a fluorescence decay [11, 12]. Therefore, barley grass powder plays an important role for solving human chronic diseases.",

            "text": "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease with high mortality rates; therefore, search for novel natural inhibitors has gained much attention [81]. Major antidiabetic elements in barley are \u03b2-glucan, phenolic compounds (phenolic acids and flavonoids), phytosterols, tocols, arabinoxylan, and resistant starch (Table 2). Oxidative stress not only leads to insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, b-cell dysfunction, ultimately diabetes but also can treat diabetes and obesity by phytochemicals (phenolic acids, flavonoids, phytosterols, and tocols) in barley [18]. Chronic consumption of foods with high \u03b2-glucans in barley can improve insulin resistance and lower the postprandial glucose response and increase satiety [82]. The \u03b2-glucan in hulless barley reduced the insulin resistance, arterial sclerosis, serum glucose, and serum lipid in high-fat mouse [83]. High phenolic content (168.7 mg/100 g) and low rapidly digested starch (38.7%) make barley muffin to modulate glycemic response [84]. The hypoglycemic effect of ethanol extract polysaccharide from barley malt is better for decreased fasting plasma glucose of the diabetes mice than that of water extract [85]. The boiled barley kernels evening meal can facilitate glucose regulation, increase the release of glucagon-like peptide-1, and reduce energy intake and fasting serum free fatty acids, mediated through gut microbial fermentation of the indigestible carbohydrates [86]. The glycemic index (GI = 82.8) of all-wheat bread is higher than that (GI = 57.2) of 60% wheat+40% barley flour (6.0% \u03b2-glucan) [87]. GI for barley with 4.6% \u03b2-glucan and oat tempe are 30 and 63, respectively [88]. The hulless barley can reduce postprandial glucose and improved insulin sensitivity by amino acid and biogenic amine profiles [89].",

RS and \u03b2-glucans as well as soluble arabinoxylan were utilized mainly in the caecum, especially RS shifted the utilization of other polysaccharides to more distal parts of the colon of pigs [94].

Barley \u03b2-glucans not only control appetite and improve insulin sensitivity by gut hormone secretion via microbiota produced SCFA [144] due to its high molecular weight and high viscosity but also increase their antigen ability and enhances the proinflammatory cytokines, which can be degraded by macrophages and natural killer cells mediating its cellular cytotoxicity opsonized tumor cells [145]. \u03b2-Glucans of barley are the major regulators of adipogenesis, especially markedly downregulated the target genes in the adipose tissue including adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, lipoprotein lipase, uncoupling protein-2, and glucose transporter 4 in 3T3-L1 cells [146] and also have the effect of inhibiting the \u03b1-amylase and pancreatic lipase [111].",

Barley \u03b2-glucans can not only regulate immune responses and connect innate and adaptive immunity [13] but also have cardioprotective mechanism of promoted angiogenesis through endothelial upregulation of the vascular growth factor [116]. The hypocholesterolaemic effect of \u03b2-glucan in barley is due to the increased bile acid synthesis [148] and improved bowel health by inhibited feed intake and increased cecal fermentation [149]. Barley \u03b2-glucan not only has the gastroprotective effects by increasing the SOD and CAT activity, decreasing the gastric ulcer index, and increasing prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide in laboratory rodents [122] but also affects lipid metabolism and SCFA production, lowering microbes in patients with metabolic syndrome [127] and improving chronic kidney disease by reducing the microbial-derived uremic toxin. Chronic consumption of barley \u03b2-glucans can decrease fatty liver by increasing small intestinal contents viscosity and improving glucose, lower glycated hemoglobin and relative kidney weights [129], strengthen the angiogenic ability of ROS-exposed endothelial cells for preventive heart disease [123], and accelerate the wound closure by promoting the migration and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts [133].",

[36] has verified the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance by fermented barley extract vanillic acid through regulating miR-212 expression. The polyphenols with antiobesity from black hulless barley has strong superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and moderate metal ion-chelating activity [97]. An efficacious antiproliferation capacity in Caco-2 cells of black barley malt free extract was predicted due to its phenolic constituents which have cellular antioxidant and oxygen radical absorbance as well as peroxyl radical scavenging activities, DPPH, and ABTS radical scavenging assays [152]. Black barley sprouting stimulates the phenolic biosynthesis by upregulating proline-associated pentose phosphate pathway to support structure of sprouts with antioxidant capacity [153]. Total phenolic and pentosan in hulless barley grains have antioxidant activity by downregulated expression of heat shock protein 60 and phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 but upregulated expression of enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase and peroxiredoxin 6 [118]. The total polyphenol (flavonoid) content and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and ABTS radical scavenging abilities increased as the barley added to the food mixture [154]. Lignan (-)-7(S)-hydroxymatairesinol inhibited tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 stimulated endothelial inflammation by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation and upregulating Nrf2 antioxidant element signaling pathway [155]. Lignans in barley have high anti-inflammatory abilities in endothelial cells by reducing nuclear factor-\u03baB and extracellular signal as well as regulating kinase phosphorylation [156]. The polyphenols such as (+)-catechin, protocatechuate, and quercetin in barley not only have hepatoprotective effect [130] but also prevent coronary heart disease by reducing oxidative-induced tissue damage through modulating intracellular signaling pathways [157]. Polyphenols play an important role in alleviating cardiovascular diseases due to their antiradical scavenging abilities [18].",

Arabinoxylan in barley is the most abundant polysaccharide that has the capacity of lowering cholesterol and glucose as well as antioxidant activities [55]. The major mechanisms of barley arabinoxylan for preventing chronic diseases are as follows: arabinoxylan can improve 21 urinary metabolites associated with diabetes by improvement of carbohydrate and lipid as well as amino acid metabolism [158]. The antioxidant and antiobesity as well as immunomodulation of arabinoxylans associated with prebiotic effects and short-chain fatty acids production by interaction of gut microbiota and arabinoxylans [122]. Arabinoxylan rice bran can increase anticancer effects in the older population by increased NK activity [159]. The arabinoxylan in barley with the immunomodulatory activity consisted of a xylan backbone with acetate, arabinose, galactose, glucuronic acid, and 4-O-methylglucuronic acid [160]. The arabinoxylan diet led to a lower postprandial blood for glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide response, especially fat oxidation has an important role in the antiobesity and in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases [161]. Barley polysaccharide prevent cardiovascular diseases by the vasodilatory effect of controlling angiotensin-converting enzyme production [17].",

Barley phytosterols have antidiabetes, antiobesity, and anticancer properties and can lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular diseases (Figure 1, Tables 2 and 3). Barley grains contain phytosterols that can esterify to fatty acids, phenolic acids, steryl glucosides, or acylated steryl glycosides [18]. Phytosterols significantly inhibited the ability of oxysterols to activate the liver X receptors transcription in modulating cancer cell behavior [62], which are thought to influence multiple processes related to cancer, such as carcinogen production, cancer-cell growth, angiogenesis, invasion, metasis, and cancer-cell apoptosis [162]. For the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, barley phytosterols can compete with cholesterol for micelle formation, inhibiting cholesterol absorption in intestine and lowering cholesterol in central nervous system of the brain [18, 162]. The effect of plant sterols on neurodegenerative diseases is due to its passage through the blood-brain barrier, modulating cholesterol metabolism and inflammation in the central nervous system process in the brain, which involve low-density-lipoprotein, apolipoprotein E, and scavenger receptor class B type 1 [162]. The lowering of cholesterol and prevention of cardiovascular disease are due to the fact that the phytosterol structure in the barley membrane is similar to the configuration of different cholesterol [18], but functionally similar to precursors in phytohormone synthesis, but lowering the blood concentration of cholesterol is beneficial to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.",

Barley tocols are the best in cereals due to a high concentration and favorable distribution of eight active vitamers [18]. Barley tocols have anticancer, antiobesity, and antioxidant effects and can lower cholesterol level, reduce the risk of stroke, and prevent cardiovascular and heart diseases (Figure 1, Tables 2 and 3) [18, 136]. Tocotrienols can suppress various cancers (breast, lung, ovary, prostate, liver, brain, colon, myeloma, and pancreas) by its molecular mechanisms of cellular proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and inflammation [63], which are associated with human intake of whole grains, especially barley and rye. Tocotrienol is a functional food of obesity and diabetes by regulating adipogenesis and increase apoptosis of adipocytes and improve glucose homeostasis through suppression of inflammation and oxidative stress [64]. Tocol is one of the most powerful antioxidants that has the ability to interact with polyunsaturated acyl groups and scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals and quench reactive oxygen species, thus protecting fatty acids from lipid peroxidation [163]. All barley pitas had the greatest antioxidant and vitamin E levels from barley malt flour [66]. The antioxidant properties of barley tocols due to its ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation in biological membranes induce the immune system, promote apoptosis induction, and reduce the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and stroke by atherosclerotic blockages in the carotid artery [18].",

Antidiabetes of RS can be increased by suppressing amylopectin synthesis through silencing of starch branching enzymes in barley [165]. T cell development and gut IgA production suppress host lipid absorption by modulating CD36 expression [166] to achieve the effect of antiobesity of barley RS. GBSS I is mainly responsible for amylose synthesis whereas SSS I and SBE II for amylopectin synthesis in amyloplasts [167]. Barley with high \u03b2-glucan and moderate RS may benefit hyperglycemia-impaired lipid metabolism [168].

Diet played an important role in early hominids evolution [170], but no reports have been delivered to date for diet in coevolution of human chronic diseases. Miocene (23.0~5.3 Ma) apes had a variety of foods that included folivory, soft-fruit eating, and hard-object feeding [170]. The diet of Pliocene (5.3~2.5 Ma) and early Pleistocene (2.5~1.4 Ma) hominids in Africa was mainly fruits and leaves of C3 plants (trees, bushes, shrubs; 5.3~4.1 Ma) which was gradually transformed into grass (C4 plant/tropical grasses and sedges) and hard-object (seeds and nuts) (4.0~1.4 Ma) [170\u2013172], which was due to low availability of fruits in dry and active glacier (1.81~1.55 Ma) as well as migration to warm grasslands. Ethiopia's Pliocene Lucy is one of the oldest and most complete fossils in hominid bones, her death due to fall out vertically and live on tall tree [173]. Early hominids and australopithecines inhabited forests and savannas for collinearity found between tasty fruits (fructose/sucrose, quinine, and tannins) and primate sensory perception, which offered evidence of the two-direction evolutionary trend determining taste sensitivity [174]. Our ape ancestors possessed a digestive dehydrogenase enzyme capable of metabolizing ethanol about 10 Ma that they began using fruits fermentation from the forest floor [175]. There were differences in the proportion of meat and vegetables between the early hominids Australopithecus and Paranthropus; Paranthropus ate more hard food than Australopithecus [176]. Early hominid Australopithecus africanus, like chimpanzees, are dominated by fruit, leaves, and carbon-13-enriched foods about 3 Ma [177]. The worldwide daily consumption of fruits and vegetables as well as tea has become the main tool for prevention of cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes due to their polyphenols modulate tau hyperphosphorylation and beta amyloid aggregation [178]. The anthocyanins and polyphenols for major functional ingredients in blueberry played a key role in preventing 15 chronic diseases [151]. The organopolysulfides and quercetin for major functional ingredients in Allium genus played a key role in preventing 10 chronic diseases [179]. Baobab was cultivated from seeds from 11 countries in East and West Africa, its leaves had the highest vitamin B2 content (1.04 \u00b1 0.05 mg/100 g) from Senegal, adult leaves provided the highest Ca content (3.373%) and young leaves with the highest Ca and K content of Nankoun in Burkina Faso [180]. The diets of early hominids related with five center of crop origin (Mediterranean, Middle East, Central Asia, Indo-Burma, and China-Korea); however, the rich food structure maintained the survival and development of early hominids who lacked survival competition and migration could not improve their intelligence. Therefore, polyphenols and K-Ca as well as vitamins ingredients in fruits/vegetables and leaves as well as grass/seeds (such as Gramineae and its ancestor species of barley) for preventive chronic disease are the results of long-term dependence for diet from Pliocene hominids in Africa to modern human beings (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Neanderthals used mushrooms and nuts rich in polysaccharide and phytosterols as well as linoleic acid as staple foods to increase the dependence of the human body on these functional ingredients (see Figure 2). Neanderthals as well as early Homo sapiens show high dietary variability in Mediterranean evergreen habitats, but less diet in high latitude steppe or coniferous forests [181]. The steppe-like Neanderthals of Belgium feed on the meat of the woolly rhinoceros and wild sheep, while the Neanderthals of the Spanish forest feature root feed on mushrooms and pine nuts [182]; Neanderthals in northern Spain roasted vegetables and used medicinal plants about 2.5~5.0 Ma [183]. Neanderthals ate meat (high chloroprostol) and plants (5\u03b2-sitosterol) as staple foods [184]. Plant foods of Neanderthals from Iraq and Belgium had the typical modern human diets, which include palms, date, legumes, and grass seeds [185]. 130 medicinal functions (major polysaccharide) in medicinal mushrooms and fungi can prevent and treat more than 10 chronic diseases [186]; however, \u03b2-glucans in barley preventive 16 chronic diseases. The total polysaccharide content in Morchella sp. reached up to 18.4% of dried biomass in a mixture of 1 : 1 of wheat grains and potato peels [187]. \u03b2-Glucans are group of polysaccharides found in mushrooms, yeasts, seaweed, barley, and oats [13]. Macrofungal \u03b2-glucans are major \u03b2-1,3- and \u03b2-1,6-glycosidic bonds, which have immunomodulatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties; total \u03b2-glucan content varied from 13.5% in A. bisporus to 40.9% in T. rutilans [188]. Phytosterols are diet ingredients found in an array of nuts, seeds, and vegetables which have anticancer activities via their interactions with the plasma cell membrane [189]. Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is one of the highest oil-yield crops in the world; however, palm oil is the largest variety of plant oil produced, consumed (30%), and internationally traded in the world, rich in linoleic acid (10%) that is associated with egFAD12 gene [190]. 50~55% carbohydrate diets (especially whole-grain breads, vegetables, and nuts) had minimal risk of mortality [191]. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains were indispensable among four top diets (Mediterranean diet with five best ranked first, DASH diet with lower blood pressure, Flexitarian diet with lose weight and MIND diet with brain health). The diets of Neanderthals was not correlated with the complete center of crop origin, poor diet (meats, mushrooms, and pine nuts) and lack of migration lead to extinction (Figure 2). These results reveal the importance of whole grain and vegetables or fruits in human health; however, lack of three categories of food suggesting the cause of the Neanderthal destruction. Therefore, polysaccharide (\u03b2-glucan) and phytosterols as well as linoleic acid in mushrooms and nuts as well as palm oil for preventive chronic disease are the results of long-term dependence for diet from Neanderthals in Europe to modern human beings (Figure 2).",

The least chronic disease of ancient humans due to replacing the salt with seasoning crops, such as onions, ginger, garlic, coriander, pepper, chili, and so on [201]. The coevolution of the preventive human chronic diseases are related to major diets of Vavilov's eight crop origin centers (Ethiopia, Mediterranean, Middle East, Central Asia, Indo-Burma, China-Korea, Mexico-Guatemala, and Peru-Ecuador-Bolivia) [8]. Human chronic diseases are related with six dietary structures (fruits/vegetables, young grass/barley grass, carnivorous, cereals crop, polished rice/wheat flour, and polished rice/wheat+grass powder), but polished rice/wheat+barley grass powder is the most major healthy dietary guidelines for modern humans; therefore, it is necessary to unravel coevolutionary mechanism between preventive chronic diseases and human diet for functional foods [202]. These results support Homo sapiens used grass/seeds (rich in GABA and enzymes as well as resistant starch), fruits/vegetables and leaves (rich in polyphenols and K-Ca as well as vitamins), mushrooms, and nuts (rich in polysaccharide and phytosterols as well as linoleic acid) as staple foods to increase the dependence of the human body on these functional ingredients.",

Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for environment; however, stimulation of dorsal raphe GABA neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive environments to promote environment-specific adaptive behaviors of serotonin [211]. Barley is a major crop in many developed countries [9]; GABA in barley grass suiting environmental extremes (cold, arid, and salt) can significantly increase, which can improve cognition and prevent 12 chronic diseases [6].

The spread of farming peoples of Eurasia from the Near East (8.0 Ka), with movements both westward and eastward, especially ancestor of modern South Asians is a mixture between early Holocene populations of Iran and South Asia; however, Yamnaya in the Bronze Age of Europe moved both westward and eastward from north of the Black Sea [216]. Discovery of different crushing apparatuses in mountains of Iran revealed that people were grinding wheat and barley about 11,000 years ago [217]. These results support the healthy food contribution between human migration and barley translocation/evolution, especially climate change increased functional ingredients in barley for preventive chronic diseases.",

Tibetan barley (qingke) is derived from eastern domesticated barley, north Pakistan, India, and Nepal between 4,500 and 3,500 years ago, which supports a feral or hybridization origin for Tibetan weedy barley [218]. The rise of barley against stress (drought, cold, salt, and bird) to staple food has increased functional ingredients (especially GABA) in diet to prevent chronic diseases and promoted human civilization. GABA-mediated inhibitory interneurons control memory-encoding CA1 neurons; nucleus incertus (NI) establishes GABAergic inhibitory synapses on interneurons; NI GABAergic cells can regulate hippocampus-dependent episodic memory formation bidirectionally, and its dysfunction may contribute to anxiety-like syndromes [219].",

The ancestral blocks of the domesticated barley genomes were descended from all over the Fertile Crescent, especially Levantine (western) and Zagros (eastern) clusters of the origin of agriculture for nine wild barley populations, i.e., Carmel and Galilee, Golan Heights, Hula Valley and Galilee, Judean Desert and Jordan Valley, Lower Mesopotamia, Negev Mountains, North Levant, Sharon, Coastal Plain and Judean Lowlands, and Upper Mesopotamia [220]. The Neolithic crops facilitated the early agricultural establishment; the barley evolution followed the agricultural development in the Near East [213]. For humans from hunter gathering to agriculture about 12 Ka of the Levant in Near East, barley was a founder crop for converting the brittle floral axis of the wild-type into a tough and nonbrittle spike, which made a major contribution to the emergence of early agrarian societies [221]. For ancient Indian civilization, the earliest known farming cultures in south Asia emerged in the hills of Balochistan in Pakistan about 9.2 Ka; however, seminomadic peoples domesticated wheat, barley, sheep, goat, and cattle [217]. For ancient Chinese civilization, the earliest beer recipe in China included broomcorn, millet, barley, Job's tears, and tubers around 5,000 y ago, which may have motivated the initial translocation of barley from the Western Eurasia into the Central Plain of China [222].",

Interestingly, the types of prevention and treatment of human chronic diseases by key functional components in barley grain were in order: \u03b2-glucans (16)>polyphenols (13)>arabinoxylan (7) = tocols (7)>phytosterols (5)>resistant starch (4), but GABA (13)>flavonoids (11)>SOD (8)>K-Ca (7) = vitamins (7)>tryptophan (3) in barley grains. The 12 key functional components of barley grains and its grass not only play an important role in the prevention and treatment of more than 20 chronic human diseases but also interact with other 30 nutritional functional components to provide the possibility to solve hundreds of human diseases caused by cell undernutrition and their detoxification disorders. The unique theory and practice system of the whole regulation improve the immunity of Chinese medicine to prevent and treat human diseases. With advances in science and technology, barley will also find many behavioral mechanisms that combat human diseases, such as barley malt has been used in many prescriptions for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in lots of provinces in China, which includes Jiangxi, Guangdong, Gansu, Guizhou, and Jiangsu province in China [223].

Therefore, it is necessary to promote the functional components of the barley grain and its grass powder under the best ecological conditions, and we also make a useful exploration of the functional components at different altitudes and in different seasons. In addition, the functional ingredients of different parts of barley grain (see Table 1) and the functional ingredients of different grass cutting stages were different.",

These results suggest that barley plays an important role in a healthy diet and in the promotion of early human intelligence. In particular, the healthy effects of functional components of barley grains and grass are the result of long-term continuous evolution of early hominids (fruits/vegetables and leaves rich in polyphenols, K-Ca, and vitamins), Neanderthals (mushrooms and nuts rich in polysaccharides, phytosterols, and linoleic acids), and Homo sapiens (grasses and seeds rich in GABA, enzymes, and resistant starch), which associate with modern humans originating in the progenitor of African Homo sapiens with cognitive hominin, especially after interbreeding between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals that took place in the Middle East. The migration route from Africa to Asia and then to Eurasia is basically consistent with the origin and spread of barley and its domestication path, which indirectly supports that barley against stress (drought, cold, and salt) enriched with functional ingredients prevented chronic disease from ancient humans to modern people. Fertile Crescent is the concentrated area of wild barley and the distribution area of ancient Babylonian civilization and ancient Egyptian civilization, among which Jerusalem is the holy place of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These results indirectly support this great contribution of barley for promoting world civilization.",

Barley is one of the most exciting potential natural sources for the development of functional foods and new drugs with improved efficiency and safety. Although we have found some relationship of origin and migration between human and barley, especially preventive role of barley for chronic diseases of human beings, it is necessary to conduct more systemic studies to unravel coevolutionary interconnection mechanism between chronic diseases prevention and human diet for barley functional foods. Unfortunately, so far there, is no evidence provided of barley evolving as part of evolutionary consumption. Barley plays an important role in promoting the development of functional food and has a potential underlying molecular mechanism and formation as well as action mechanism, which is worthy of further study. This review can be used as a starting point for novel nutraceuticals and functional foods and drugs for barley to improve the prognosis of chronic diseases.",
