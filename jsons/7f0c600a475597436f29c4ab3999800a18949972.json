By combining the individual-level data from the \"China Migrants Dynamic Survey\" and citylevel statistical data, we find that EHFPSM contributes to a 6.9% statistically significant increase in the probability of electronic health records coverage and a 7.2% increase in the probability of reimbursement in the last inpatient visit, as well as a 1.2% decrease in the probability of one-year prevalence. The mechanism test shows that this program J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof promotes the migrants' understanding of the policies and social insurance coverage to enhance their health status. EHFPSM brings about more significant decreases in disease prevalence for male and less-educated migrants, and higher reimbursement probability for urban hukou migrants. Our paper facilitates better understanding of the role of public health policies in promoting the internal migrants' health from the perspective of China.",

Forty prefecture-level cities are assigned as the pilot cities, and a series of free basic public health and family planning J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f services are provided to the internal migrants. There are some advantages of using this program in our study. First, the program provides a unique quasi-natural experiment for this study to clearly identify the effect of EHFPSM. 1 Secondly, much of the previous research assesses the effect of medical insurances to reduce the burden of illness (Qin, Pan, & Liu, 2014) , while we investigate the effect of public health services to promote and maintain the health status of migrants. 2 Besides, the combination of the individual-level \"China Migrants Dynamic Survey\" (CMDS) data and city-level statistical data facilitates a better understanding of the effects of public health policies on the health welfare of internal migrants, who have enormous difficulties in accessing to those services before the implementation of this program (Gao, Yang, & Li, 2012; Kinnan et al., 2018; Meng, 2012) .",

For example, Perreira & Pedroza (2019) summarized the literature concerning the influence of public policies on American immigrants' health and found that inclusive policies promote their health service coverage and adaptation to the United States, whereas exclusive policies have the opposite impacts. In contrast to many developed countries, where migrants have access to essential services such as basic healthcare and schooling with the same conditions as legal residents (Pinotti, 2017) , China's internal migrants have a high transaction cost in access to basic public health services (Di Napoli, Petrelli, Rossi, Mirisola, & Rosano, 2018; Hu, Cook, & Salazar, 2008; The Lancet, 2017) . Besides, because of the late implementation of migrant-targeted public health policies in China, little research attention has been paid to the impact of those policies on migrants, except for only one study of Wang, Cheng, & Ni (2019) . They found a positive association between EHFPSM and medical service utilization but failed to tackle the endogeneity problem of migrants' selection of the destination cities. To sum up, there is still a lack of comprehensive studies of how public health policies influence the health status and health welfare of internal migrants, and the present study aims to fill this gap.",

We then investigate the underlying mechanisms and find that EHFPSM imposes its positive effect on migrants through strengthening their awareness of \"electronic health records\" (EHRs), \"Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance\" (UEBMI) coverage and \"work injury insurance\" (WII) coverage. We further compare the equalization effect of EHFPSM between different subgroups and find that EHFPSM brings about more significant positive impacts on less-educated or male migrants in health status, and on the urban hukou migrants 4 in medical service utilization. Finally, several robustness checks are carried out. Specifically, we conduct an additional control of \"New Rural Cooperative Medical Insurance\" (NRCMI) and city-level labor market conditions based on the sampling survey data from 1% China Census in 2005. The results strongly support a positive association between EHFPSM implementation and migrants' health status and health welfare.",

Moreover, it helped to advance the global primary health-care movement in 1978 enshrined in the Declaration of Alma-Ata (Li et al., 2017) . In the late 1970s, China started its economic reform with obvious urban-biased policies. The rationing system guaranteed permanent jobs for urban hukou labors and provided urban residents with access to primary food, housing, and education, as well as healthcare, at quite low prices. In contrast to the large government expenditure for urban residents, expenditure for rural residents was much lower. For example, the number of hospital beds and medical staff for every 1,000 people in cities was 4.57 and 7.82 in the 1980s, while it was merely 1.48 and 1.81 in rural areas (Zhang & Kanbur, 2005) .

Specifically, it includes providing vaccination, such as supplementary immunization, mass vaccination and emergency vaccination, of diseases (i.e. hepatitis B, measles and polio) for migrant children aged 0-6 years who have lived in the pilot cities for no less than three months. Besides, measures such as checking of vaccination certificates for migrant children's enrollment in kindergartens or schools are strictly implemented.

(5) Strengthening the health service management of migrant pregnant/lying-in women and children. Specifically, comprehensive health care, as well as maternal and neonatal preventions of AIDS, syphilis and mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B are strengthened.
