As we demonstrate below, the coefficient of determination (R squared) is lowi.e. the proportion of the variance in average vaccine development project costs by R&D phase that can be predicted from the explanatory variables in the regression models. This coefficient does not improve when running non-linear (e.g. logarithmic or exponential) regressions, which we also tested. However, the coefficient improves when hierarchically clustering the data. We therefore opted for OLS, which are well-established methods with robust (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator) properties.

Optimization techniques can provide insights on how to prioritize R&D investments through the minimization or maximization of objective functions subject to analytical constraints that cannot be exceeded. 1 Moreover, the simultaneous consideration of multiple candidate projects is a key aspect in managing a new product development pipeline. 2 In pharmaceutical R&D management, several stochastic modelling approaches have been proposed to address a variety problems. A multistage simulation-optimization model identified the optimal number of projects required to deliver pharmaceutical R&D outputs that maximize economic value. 3 Discrete-event simulation was combined with mixed integer linear programming for the optimal structuring of, and ordering of activities within pharmaceutical R&D portfolios. 4 Mixed integer linear programming using simulation and real options valuation was employed to determine the optimal size and structuring of pharmaceutical R&D portfolios. 5 Discrete-event simulation was combined with genetic algorithm based optimization procedures for the optimal selection and ordering of pharmaceutical R&D projects to maximize economic value and to minimize the probability of economic losses. 6 In other approaches discrete-event simulation was combined with efficient frontier analysis to identify optimal pharmaceutical R&D portfolios at different levels of risk and budget constraints. 7, 8 Simulation-optimization techniques have been proposed that incorporate mixed integer linear programming for the optimal scheduling and allocation of resources for pharmaceutical R&D pipelines. 9 Other related approaches were proposed for clinical trial scheduling and value maximization in pharmaceuticals. [10] [11] [12] An event stochastic simulation model used multi-objective genetic algorithms for the optimal structuring and sequencing of pharmaceutical R&D portfolios to minimize time, minimize risk and maximize economic value of R&D. 2 Others used multistage stochastic programming with knapsack decomposition algorithms for the optimal structuring of pharmaceutical R&D pipelines, 13 and multi-range robust optimization techniques for pharmaceutical R&D project selection. 14 A number of simulation-optimization techniques for simultaneous portfolio management and manufacturing capacity planning are summarized in the literature. 15 So are several other simulation-optimization techniques for time dependent optimization of new product development pipeline schedules. 2 And programming techniques have recently been reviewed using chance constrained optimization for the optimization of pharmaceutical development processes under uncertainty. 16 This literature demonstrates that stochastic optimization can provide meaningful prioritization insights for new product development in the presence of uncertainty. Given the inherently risky nature of vaccine R&D, stochastic modelling approaches are likely to represent realistic reflections of the uncertain expectations from the pharmaceutical R&D process. However, this evidence predominantly provides theoretical approaches to hypothetical, yet challenging and sophisticated problems may relate to, but do not directly address real-life situations.

The algorithm learns and adapts its search for even better optima in relation to a current solution, as the composition of the population of candidate solutions changes. This adaptation is supported by random changes (mutations) to the original (the parent) population of candidate solutions, yielding new candidate solutions (the children)which may or may not be an improvement to previous solutions. Throughout this process, an evolutionary algorithm selects the 'fittest' and eliminates the 'least fit' members of the population of candidate solutions. An evolutionary algorithm will continue to drive towards ever-better, or at least ever-new, solutions in comparison to previously generated solutions, only to be constrained by rules designed to serve as stopping conditions in the computation process. These include: (1) the maximum computation time allowed; (2) the number of 'fitness' iterations allowed; (3) the maximum time allowed for fitness iterations to take place without improving on the current solutions; (4) and the minimization of differences between new versus previous sets of solutions. 18 The latter condition, also known as convergence, is a critical indication of whether optimal or near-optimal solutions have been met. However, premature convergencethe loss of diversity between sets of solutions too quickly in the search processcan lead to solutions that are not near-optimal. To avoid this, the number of optimization runs permitted in any given optimization problem making use of evolutionary algorithms needs to be substantial. Although a good practice, there is no agreement on the minimum threshold for the number of optimization runs required for evolutionary algorithms to reach convergent, or near optimal solutions. 18 In our study, we ran between 10 and 100 optimizations on the same problem, for each stage of the model. We assumed that a minimum of 10 optimizations would be sufficient to minimize the risk of early convergence on the problem for each stage of the model. If differences between model parameters were consistently zero or close to zero on their 5 th and 95 th percentile values after 5 consecutive optimizations, beyond and above the 10 minimum runs, we then assumed that a convergent solution had been found.",

The model uses these measures to decide what set of values it should try next for the decision variablesand the process is repeated with a new simulation conducted at each step of the optimization. The overall benefit of simulationoptimization is the treatment of optimization outcomes as probabilistic outcomes accounting for uncertainty. A significant limitation associated with such techniques is the number of computational steps required to derive solutions, which can grow exponentially with the number of variables and constraints included in the optimization problem. For instance, the cumulative computational time for solutions across all stages of our model was over 20 hours in total.",

            "text": "In stage 2, we asked how much investment would be needed to progress at least one vaccine through end of phase IIa by EID, given current and new preclinical vaccine candidates are made available. As table 5.3 demonstrates, the probabilities associated with at least one phase IIa outcome per EID at a total cost of less than US$ 4 billion or more than US$ 7 billion are less than 2% across scenarios. The most likely cost range for achieving the minimum phase IIa targets for all 10 EIDs is US$5 -6 billion, followed by the US$4 -5 billion range and the US$6 -7 billion range, respectively. Finally, as table 5.4 demonstrates, the variance in expected phase IIa outcomes is strongly correlated with the variance in PoS by R&D phase, and in particular with PoS in phase II. The variance in associated portfolio costs is positively correlated with both costs and PoS by R&D phase. However, the variance in expected costs is most sensitive to preclinical and phase II costs, followed by PoS by R&D phase. This sensitivity analysis demonstrates that whereas zero phase II outcomes are unlikely, expected phase II outcomes above and beyond one phase IIb/III ready candidate are dependent on the PoS. Moreover, whereas the likelihood of portfolio costs below US$ 1 billion or above US$8 billion to achieve minimum preparedness R&D targets for the EIDs of interest is close to zero, the likely cost below or above this range will depend on the relationship of the PoS by R&D phase and the cost associated with experience and indirect costs of the vaccine developers. For instance, in a scenario where low costs were associated with high PoS distributions the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be funded as per the high PoS/high Cost scenario, but the overall portfolio cost would drop to US$ 1.6 billion (US$715 million -2.9 billion range); whereas in a scenario where high costs were associated with low PoS distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be funded as per the low PoS/low Cost scenario, however the portfolio cost would increase to US$ 6.8 billion (US$1.5 -15.1 billion range).

The standard deviation of the cost of one vaccine candidate successfully advancing through end of phase IIa in the simulationoptimization deviates increasingly from the standard deviation observed in the self-reported data as the number of vaccine candidates considered start from earlier phases of development and PoS distributions by R&D phase are taken into account (for comparison of standard deviations see Appendix table 5.6 below). In line with the sensitivity analysis above, this suggests that the amplification of uncertainty in the measurement of EID vaccine R&D costs is solely based on the objective function of the simulation-optimization model (minimum 1 phase IIa outcome) and the impact of PoS distributions by R&D phase on the numbers of vaccine candidates required per R&D phase to achieve this objective. There are no other sources of uncertainty amplification in the analysis in relation to the variation observed in the self-reported cost data. ",

To do this we are employing a probabilistic sensitivity analysis approach, inherent in Monte Carlo simulations 24 and simulation-optimization methods, 25 whereby probability distributions are defined for the uncertain parameters of the model: cost and PoS by R&D phase. By simulating the consequences of random drawings from these distributions, we are able to determine the likelihood that different outcomes will occur and to identify the most significant sources of variation in our model's outcomes.In stage 1, we asked how many vaccine candidates would ideally need to enter into preclinical, or phase I, or phase II, to achieve at least one phase IIa outcome by EID. The probabilities associated with the occurrence of at least one phase IIa outcome due to vaccine candidates entering different phases of the R&D pipeline by disease are presented in table 5.1 for the low PoS/ low cost scenario and in table 5.2 for the high PoS/ high cost scenario, respectively. Here we find that the probability of zero phase IIa outcomes remains consistently below 5% across scenarios. For each EID, the probability of one vaccine progressing through end of phase IIa is higher than the respective probability of two or more phase IIa outcomes in the low PoS/Cost scenario (see ",
