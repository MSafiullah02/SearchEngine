Palivizumab (PZ) is the only RSV-specific immunoprophylaxis approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Mutations leading to amino acid substitutions in the PZ binding site of the RSV F protein have been associated with breakthrough RSV infections in patients receiving PZ. Objective: To detect PZ resistance conferring mutations in RSV strains from children who received PZ. Study design: Children aged \u226424 months on October 31 who were hospitalized or had outpatient visits for respiratory illness and/or fever during October-May 2001-2008 in 3 US counties were included. PZ receipt was obtained from parent interviews and medical records among children subsequently infected with RSV. Archived nasal/throat swab specimens were tested for RSV by real-time RT-PCR. The coding region of the PZ binding site of the RSV F protein was sequenced using both Sanger and pyrosequencing methods. Results: Of 8762 enrolled children, 375 (4.3%) were tested for RSV and had a history of PZ receipt, of which 56 (14.9%) were RSV-positive and 45 of these had available archived specimens. Molecular typing identified 42 partial F gene sequences in specimens from 39 children: 19 single RSV subgroup A, 17 subgroup B and 3 mixed infections. Nucleotide substitutions were identified in 12/42 (28.6%) RSV strains. PZ resistance mutations were identified in 4 (10.2%) of the 39 children, of which one had documented PZ receipt. Conclusions: Although RSV PZ resistance mutations were infrequent, most RSV-associated illnesses in children with a history of PZ receipt were not due to strain resistance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Published by Elsevier B.V.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory infections resulting in hospital admission and death among children <5 years worldwide [1] .

Infants born prematurely and those with chronic lung or cardiac disease are at increased risk for severe disease from RSV infection. Palivizumab (PZ; brand name Synagis \u00ae , MedImmune Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), is a humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that neutralizes RSV by inhibiting viral fusion through interaction with a site spanning residues 262-276 of the RSV fusion glycoprotein (F) [3] [4] [5] . PZ is the only prophylaxis approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration against RSV infection. [6, 7] . Five monthly PZ injections spanning the annual RSV epidemic period have been shown to reduce hospitalizations among high-risk children in the US [6] .
