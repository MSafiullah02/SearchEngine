            "text": "Being a coronavirus and, therefore, a single-stranded RNA virus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has an enormous capacity to change by spontaneous mutation and genetic recombination. It is believed that spontaneous mutations and genetic recombination can occur randomly in the IBV genome; however, if these events occur in the spike (S) gene, especially in its hypervariable regions, these events are most likely to result in the emergence of many different antigenic or genotypic types, which are commonly referred to as variants. Therefore, IBV is ubiquitous in most parts of the world where poultry are reared, and it is able to spread very rapidly in non-protected chicken flocks, leading to heavy economic losses in poultry industries (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). In general, while many new variants are unable to replicate or survive for a long time, a few variants that are of economic importance have emerged worldwide or in restricted geographic areas. Therefore, effective surveillance, which is primarily based on the isolation and identification of the virus type causing disease, is of great importance.",

            "text": "Classification or typing of IBV strains is very important for implementing control measures, research purposes, and understanding the epidemiology and evolution of IBVs. Thus far, two major groups of classification systems, including functional tests that examine the biological functions of a virus (immunotypes, protectotypes, and serotypes) and non-functional tests that assess the viral genome (genotypes), are commonly used for IBV typing (de Wit, 2000). For a specific IBV strain, although evidence from some studies suggests that there is a high correlation between the genotype and serotype, other studies have presented conflicting data (de Wit, 2000, Zhang et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2015), which may lead to contradictory results. The disadvantages of each system are that they only analyze one or several characteristics of a virus strain. Hence, data from only one system has to be interpreted with caution, while a more objective and accurate conclusion can be drawn by completely analyzing the results from different systems, although it is suggested that the preferred typing system usually depends on the goal (e.g., selection of vaccination programs or epidemiological studies), available techniques, experience, and costs (de Wit, 2000).",

            "text": "A large number of IBV genotypes and variants have been isolated in China in recent years (Han et al., 2011), among which two genotypes, the LX4 and ck/CH/LDL/97I types (also known as QX- and Q1-like, respectively), were first isolated in China and subsequently have become widespread worldwide (Valastro et al., 2016). Among these IBV genotypes, the TW1 type was first isolated in 1992 in Taiwan, and it was considered to have a different genotype than all of the other IBVs (Wang and Tsai, 1996). The majority of TW1 IBVs isolated from Taiwan are nephropathogenic, and they have mortality rates ranging from 10 to 60% in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens (Wang and Tsai, 1996). However, the naturally recombinant TW I (nrTW I) genotype was first isolated in 2009 in China, and it was thought to have originated from a natural recombination between LX4 and TW1 viruses (Xu et al., 2016). Despite a previous study that characterized the genetic characteristics of an nrTW I type virus and its nephropathogenicity in 7-day-old SPF chickens (Xu et al., 2016), there is no further information on this important IBV variant. To better understand the nrTW I type, a series of experiments was performed to investigate its antigenicity and pathogenicity in the oviducts of SPF layers, and to evaluate the protection provided by commercial vaccines and attenuated viruses.",

The IBV strains LDL/091022 (Liu et al., 2013), LSD/120720, and LGX/100508 (Chen et al., 2015) were isolated in China and belong to the LX4 type. These three strains were attenuated by serially passaging them 120 (P120), 90 (P90), and 70 (P70) times, respectively, in 10-day-old SPF chicken eggs. The LDL/091022 P120, LSD/120720 P90, and LGX/100508 P70 strains were shown to be fully attenuated in SPF chickens (Liu et al., 2009a). Furthermore, vaccination with attenuated viruses provided complete protection against their virulent parental viruses (data not shown). The LDL/97I strain was also passaged 115 times (P115) in SPF chicken eggs (Liu et al., 2009b). Each of the virus stocks was prepared in 10-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs by the allantoic route of inoculation, and the infectious allantoic fluid was collected 48 h post-inoculation as previously described (Liu et al., 2009a). The titers of the viruses were determined as previously described (Chen et al., 2015), and the median embryo infectious dose (EID50) was calculated using the method of Reed and Muench (1938).",

After 2 weeks, a booster dose of each virus with 106 EID50 was administered by intravenous inoculation to the bird. Birds were exsanguinated 1 week after the last inoculation and the separated sera from chickens inoculated with the same virus were pooled. All sera were inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min and stored in 2.0 ml aliquots at \u221280 \u00b0C until required. For virus neutralization, sera were serially diluted two-fold with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and mixed with 200 EID50 of the IBV strains. After incubation for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, virus-serum mixtures were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of SPF chicken embryos, which were observed for 7 d. The end-point titer of each serum sample was calculated using the method of Reed and Muench (1938).",

The clinical signs from all of the birds in each group were counted by three people over a 2-min period. Morbidity and mortality were recorded daily. Gross lesions were also carefully examined from the dead chickens, and the kidneys of the dead chickens were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) using monoclonal antibody 6D10 (Han et al., 2013), which is directed against the nucleoprotein, as previously described (de Wit et al., 2011, Xu et al., 2016). Blood samples were collected on 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 d post-challenge (dpc) from all birds, and they were examined for the presence of antibodies against IBV using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (IDEXX, Portland, ME, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 4 months of age, the birds were killed humanely using carbon dioxide/oxygen, followed by exsanguination. A post-mortem examination was performed, and special attention was paid to abnormalities in the oviducts and kidneys.

Thus, further examination of the protection conferred by commercially available IBV vaccines and attenuated viruses against challenge with the novel serotype nrTW I strain was important for evaluating the extent of protection against distinct antigenic types. Comparatively, the vaccine strain LDT3-A and two attenuated viruses, LDL/091022 P120 and LDL/97I P115, provided good clinical protection against challenge with the nrTW I strain, although all the strains analyzed in this study have actually percentages of similarity with nrTW I that are of almost the same value (they ranged from 76.1 to 82% of similarity at a nucleotide level, and from 75.3 to 81.4% of similarity at an amino acid level). Some antigenic epitopes that have roles in the protection have also been identified on the S2 and N proteins of IBV (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2005) and may attribute to the difference of the cross-protection. Further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between antigenic epitopes on S (both S1 and S2) and N proteins and the level of protection provided in challenge studies. As illustrated in Table 4, the currently available vaccines and attenuated viruses did not provide sufficient respiratory protection against nrTW I challenge, which is in agreement with the genotyping and serotyping results. The results showed that the challenge virus was shed by some chickens in all of the vaccinated groups for at least 12 dpc. Additionally, the high rates of challenge virus isolation (less than 80% at 4 dpc) from chickens that were vaccinated with the heterologous vaccines indicated that none of these vaccines and attenuated viruses provided sufficient protection against the IBV nrTW I strain, especially if a reduction of IBV transmission is considered to be important. These results revealed that it is necessary to develop new live vaccines or evaluate the use of established vaccines in combination to control nrTW I-type IBV strains in the future.",

            "text": "Over the past 20 years, nephropathogenic IBV strains have emerged as the most predominant IBV strains in the poultry industry, and they are responsible for many outbreaks of kidney disease on chicken farms (de Wit et al., 2011). Generally, the nephropathogenic IBV strains have a tropism for the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, which leads to clinical signs such as excessive water consumption and wet droppings, followed by a severe renal infection that leads to increased mortality, as shown in the case for the nrTW I strain in our previous study (Xu et al., 2016), which was corroborated in the present study. Our results also confirmed that the morbidity and mortality caused by nrTW I infection was age-dependent (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). It was shown that many of the infections in young chickens caused by IBV strains result in permanent damage to the oviduct (Broadfoot et al., 1954, Broadfoot et al., 1956), which leads to a significant reduction in egg production and quality upon sexual maturity. The effect of IBV on the oviduct of chickens is extremely variable. There are at least four major factors that influence the severity of oviduct lesions following IBV infection, as well as the outcome regarding the induction of false layers: the IBV strain that is involved, the age at infection, the presence of strain-specific, virus-neutralizing, maternally-derived antibodies at the time of infection, and the early protection induced by vaccinating young chickens (Crinion and Hofstad, 1972, de Wit et al., 2011). Infections with different strains of LX4 type (QX-like) viruses can induce cystic oviducts with water-like fluid accumulation in some chickens that survive the infection, and cystic oviducts were observed at different ages after challenge (Benyeda et al., 2009, de Wit et al., 2011), whereas no lesions could be observed in the oviducts after infection with the pathogenic 4/91 strain (Benyeda et al., 2009, de Wit et al., 2011). For the Mass serotype viruses, it appears that the induction of cystic lesions/false layers differs among different strains (Crinion, 1972, Jones and Jordan, 1972, Benyeda et al., 2009). These differences are not related to virulence because it was shown that a live attenuated strain, H52, was capable of producing similar pathological changes (Duff et al., 1971). A recent study showed that cystic oviducts were also found in some SPF female chicks that were infected with an IS/885/00-like virus (Awad et al., 2016), which was first detected in Israel (Meir et al., 2004) and later found in other parts of the world (Awad et al., 2016). In this study, we found that the nrTW I strain could induce cystic oviducts in SPF chickens of different ages within 1 month post-challenge. The nrTW I strain emerged recently in China, and it originated from recombination events between TW I- and LX4-like (QX) viruses (Xu et al., 2016). One of the parental viruses, the TW1 IBV strain, was first isolated in 1992 in Taiwan, and it is a nephropathogenic IBV strain; however, it was unknown whether it could induce cystic oviducts (Wang and Tsai, 1996). In contrast, it was clearly shown that another parental virus (the LX4 type or QX-like) could induce both nephritis and cystic oviducts in chickens that survived infection (Benyeda et al., 2009, de Wit et al., 2011). The nrTW I strain acquired the 3\u2032 sequences of the Nsp16 and S1 genes from a TW I-like virus, and the rest of its genome from an LX4-like virus, although the tissue tropism and pathogenicity determinants of IBV remain unknown (Xu et al., 2016). In addition, our results also confirmed that as they age, chickens become more resistant to oviduct damage caused by nrTW I infections (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). Similar to other reports (Benyeda et al., 2009), our results showed that viral antigens in the kidneys and oviducts of the surviving chickens became undetectable immunohistochemically by the end of the experiment; this is in agreement with our field experience, which showed that IBVs could not be isolated (in most cases) from chickens exhibiting cystic oviducts.",

In addition, a cross-neutralization test showed that the nrTW I strain of the nrTW I genotype has a novel serotype that differs from those of the other strains used in this study. A vaccination-challenge test using different heterologous live vaccines and attenuated viruses in 1-day-old chickens did not induce high levels of protection against challenge at 20 days of age, which suggests that it is necessary to develop new live vaccines or evaluate the use of established vaccines in combination to control nrTW I type IBV strains in future.",
