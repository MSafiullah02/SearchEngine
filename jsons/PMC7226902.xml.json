While much if not most scientific research is dual-use in some trivial sense, i.e. it has the capacity to inflict some harms and/or some benefits, the kind of dual-use research I am concerned with is research that has the capacity to inflict very great harms and/or benefits. Such a benefits might include, for example, the cure for a highly virulent infectious disease or \u201cpotential pandemic pathogen,\u201d such as avian influenza. A commensurate potential harm might be the creation of such a potential pandemic pathogen.4 This research poses an ethical issue because the capacity of dual-use research to be used or misused invokes questions, inter alia, about the limits of scientific freedom, and kinds of values science promotes, or ought to promote, and the distribution of the risks and benefits of scientific innovation in society. Dual-use presents a dilemma because, in some cases, it is not clear where the balance of risks and benefits, or rights, lies.",

Ronald Jackson and Ian Ramshaw worked as part of a team sponsored by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Australian National University (ANU) to create a recombinant form of the myxoma virus, a poxvirus that infects rabbits. In the 1950s, myxoma had been used to control the plagues of rabbits that had devastated the Australian countryside since the late nineteenth century. While the initial release was almost totally successful, the small number of rabbits that survived inevitably did what they did best\u2014bred like rabbits\u2014back to their original population size.5 Ramshaw, a student of Frank Fenner (better known for his work eradicating smallpox and a stunt in which he and two colleagues inoculated themselves with the myxoma virus, to demonstrate its safety in humans6), was along with Jackson charged with coming up for a cure to this resistance, and put an end to the plague.",

Rabbits are more expensive and larger than mice, making experiments with them less convenient to use; ectromelia is also a better-characterised poxvirus than myxoma. Their experiments with ectromelia showed some initial success: mice infected with the virus would remain infertile for between five and nine months.7\n",

The results, however, were unexpected. A paper in 2001 by the team in the Journal of Virology reported that more than sterilizing the mice, the virus outright killed its hosts.
