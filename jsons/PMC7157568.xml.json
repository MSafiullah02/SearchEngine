PEDV has an enveloped virion, containing the single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of ~28 kb and seven open reading frames (ORFs) [4]. ORF1a and ORF1b encode the nonstructural replicase proteins required for transcription and translation. The structural proteins are encoded by the ORFs at the 3\u2019 end of the genome, including the spike protein (S), the ORF3 accessory protein, the envelope protein (E), the membrane protein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The ORFs are flanked by 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 untranslated regions.",

PEDV evolved, and variants of highly virulent PEDV strains emerged in China in 2010 [13]. After its introduction to the United States in 2013 [14], and further spread to other countries in North, Central and South America [15], high morbidity and mortality has been reported mainly in neonates born to na\u00efve sows. However, older pigs (feeders, finishers and adults) are also affected but with less overall severity and a higher rate of recovery than neonatal pigs [3,16]. Unfortunately, the age-related mechanisms associated to the severity of the disease have not been fully elucidated. To date, only one PEDV serotype has been recognized [17,18]. However, PEDV variants have different insertions or deletions (INDEL) in the S protein [19], which seems to be associated to differences on pathogenesis in conventional neonatal pigs [20].",

However, the immunoassay landscape has dramatically evolved in recent years looking for more analytically sensitive, rapid and simple, yet high-throughput screening methods. As an example of recent innovation, amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (AlphaLISA) is a bead-based amplified luminescent proximity homogenous assay platform originally developed by PerkinElmer to study biomolecular interactions (Figure S1) [22]. The versatility and flexibility of this platform lies in that donor and acceptor beads can be coupled to antibodies and/or specific proteins which interact with the target analyte, bringing the beads into proximity with each other and leading to an energy transfer and emission of a chemiluminescent signal. Moreover, as a microfluidic non-wash platform, it allows a reduction in assay steps.",

Briefly, 0.1 mg of S1 protein (1 mg/mL) was mixed with 1 mg AlphaLISA beads in a 2 mL vial (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, USA) and completed with reaction buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.4) to a final reaction volume of 200 \u00b5L. Then, 1.25 \u00b5L of 10% Tween-20 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 10 \u00b5L of a 400 mM solution of the reducing agent sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN; Sigma) were added to the 2 mL vial and the reaction mix was incubated for 18\u201324 h at 37 \u00b0C with mild agitation (6\u201310 rpm) using a rotary shaker. Unreacted aldehyde groups on beads were blocked by adding 10 \u00b5L solution of carboxymethoxylamine (CMO, Sigma) at 65 mg/mL in 800 mM sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Sigma) followed by a 60 min incubation at 37 \u00b0C under mild agitation. The uncoupled S1 protein was removed by centrifugation (16,000\u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C) and washing the beads three times. Supernatant was removed with a micropipette and the bead pellet resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. The bead solution was briefly sonicated in a sonicating water bath (Branson Ultrasonic Corp., Danbury, CT, USA) to ensure that the beads are not aggregated. After the last centrifugation, beads were resuspended at 5 mg/mL in storage buffer (200 \u00b5L of PBS + 0.05% Proclin-300 as a preservative), re-sonicated and stored at 4 \u00b0C until use.",

Incubations were performed in half area 96-well white plates (PerkinElmer) at room temperature (~22 \u00b0C), protected from light, and on a rotating shaker. In the first step either 5 \u00b5L of serum sample or control, pre-diluted 1:100 in PBS pH 7.4 (Gibco, Thermo Scientific), was incubated for 1 h with 20 \u00b5L of a mix containing 25 \u00b5g/mL of S1 protein-conjugated AlphaLISA Acceptor beads and 7.5 nM biotinylated goat anti-pig IgG (Fc) or 5 nM biotinylated goat anti-pig IgA (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA) in assay buffer 1x (AlphaLISA Assay Buffer 10X; PerkinElmer). Then, in a second step, 25 \u00b5L of 80 \u00b5g/mL Streptavidin Donor beads (PerkinElmer) were directly added to each well and incubated for 1 h in a final reaction volume of 50 \u00b5L per well. In the presence of PEDV-specific IgG and/or IgA antibodies, Acceptor and Donor beads come into close proximity. Laser irradiation of Donor beads at 680 nm caused the release of singlet oxygen molecules that triggered a cascade of chemical events in nearby Acceptor beads, which resulted in a sharp peak in chemiluminescent emission at 615 nm that was read in an EnVision\u00ae multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer) (Figure S1). AlphaLISA results were converted into sample-to-positive ratios on the basis of the positive and negative internal controls.",

In brief, the homotrimeric S glycoprotein, class I fusion protein essential for both host specificity and viral infectivity, is the main driver of the neutralizing antibody and T-cell immune responses against PEDV and a major immunogenic target for vaccine design [25,26,27]. Similar to other coronaviruses, PEDV S protein is composed of two subunits; the highly variable S1 subunit (N-terminal) contains receptor-binding domain(s), which remains unknown, responsible for viral attachment and the conserved S2 subunit (C-terminal) which mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes, and contains immunodominant neutralizing epitopes [28,29]. The selected S1 region is characterized by multiple amino acid insertions, deletions, and substitutions [30], that allow for a differential serodiagnosis of PEDV and rule out cross-reactivity against other porcine coronaviruses that might be cocirculating in swine herds [23]. However, S1 may not recognize some neutralizing antibodies specifically directed against S2 [29]. Although structural proteins N and M are highly antigenic, they are also one of the most conserved and, therefore, cross-reactive proteins among coronaviruses [23].",

To achieve this objective, a homogeneous (no washing steps required) 2 h and two-steps AlphaLISA IgG/IgA assay platform was used. Experimental serum samples were previously tested by IgG ELISA and multiplex Luminex platform [24], while field serum samples were previously tested by IgG/IgA ELISA [23]. Like in these previous studies, PEDV IgG and IgA specific antibodies were detected by AlphaLISA toward the beginning of the second week of infection, regardless of exposure conditions. Longitudinal field study allowed further assessment of the duration of IgG and IgA antibody response in a serum. In concordance with our previous study [24], PEDV IgG antibodies were detected for at least 16 wpe by AlphaLISA, showing a similar downward trend than that obtained by ELISA. However, the AlphaLISA serum IgA levels remained high and relatively stable throughout the study lasting longer than the IgA levels previously reported by ELISA. Unexpectedly and contrary to the serum antibody profile obtained by ELISA, we reported a strong long-lasting AlphaLISA IgA response compared to the AlphaLISA IgG response. This study demonstrates that isotype antibody detection would depend on the analytical sensitivity and dynamic range of the immunoassay platform used.",
