The effect of removal should not be underestimated, and, thus, removing the isolation gown or apron arbitrarily, without following proper procedures, such as by forcefully peeling off the gown or plastic apron, should be avoided.

PPC2 carried the lowest contaminative hazards to the hands, shoes, and surroundings compared with PPC1 and PPC3. Cotton through its material and properties can absorb droplet contaminants and thereby reduce opportunities for such contaminants to spread to the environment. However, Table 3 shows that the absorbent fabric likewise increased underwear contamination by liquid crossing outerwear. This fact is particularly true with the CDC method, which takes longer8 because of the rusty technique, which increased the absorbent time of the cotton gown fabric and caused heavier underwear contamination in the CDC method (1.58 in IARM vs 2.48 in CDC method for fluorescent stains).",

The other gown (nonwoven gown) can resist the absorption of liquid contaminants when the covered area is sufficient and thus provides better physical barrier protection than the woven gown. However, the nonwoven gown has weak liquid absorption ability. The liquid contaminant may easily drop to the floor or splash to the surrounding environment during movement. More important, an extra force added to the movement, such as by pulling off the isolation gown without unfastening the ties, tearing off the plastic apron, or removing the gown or apron forcefully, spreads droplet contaminants that can splash not only to the surrounding environment but also to nearby patients. Therefore, determining the type of isolation gown to use is important. The present results suggest that double gowns with outer absorbent cotton reduce the spread of contaminants to the environment, whereas inner water repellency gowns can resist contaminants and prevent them from penetrating into underwear and even the skin, providing better protection than a single gown in preventing HCW from coming into contact with patients' blood and body fluids during surgery and other splashing procedures. Although the gowns made from different materials had different characteristics, on the whole, the CDC removal method significantly reduced bodily and environmental contamination.",

This result may be due to the fact that nursing staff come into contact with patients more often. The level of contamination indicated a significant improvement in the post-test. As a result, to enhance their knowledge and technique on the removal of used PPE, regular training on the proper handling of used PPE should be performed in a real clinical setting, and return demonstration must be required.

Thus, conducting an experimental study to generate potential data to compare the CDC-recommended method of gown removal with IARM for their level of environmental contamination during procedures is necessary. The results of this study support the notion that the CDC-recommended gown removal method has less impact on environment and bodily contamination (ie, on the hands, shoes, and uniform of the subject). Our results verify the 3 hypotheses presented in the introduction. In summary, when the isolation gown or apron is removed following IARM, the hands, uniforms, and shoes of HCWs, as well as the environment, can be contaminated. The plastic apron and cotton gown carried the highest and lowest contaminative hazards. The CDC-recommended gown removal method can reduce environmental and bodily contaminations. Our findings underscore the importance of the method as follows: (1) choose a proper location when discarding used PPC; (2) following the appropriate procedures for removing PPE; (3) proper PPC is to be selected; (4) proper training and supervision for HCWs in infection control measures should be in place; (5) wash the hands immediately after removal procedures; and (6) separate daily shoes from working shoes, and these shoes should not be mixed with uniform and other belongings in personal lockers.",
