We developed a point-of-care tool to summarize outcome data for critically ill patients with COVID-19 and help guide clinicians through a thoughtful prognostication process. Two authors reviewed studies of outcomes of patients with critical illness due to COVID-19 and created a visual infographic tool based on available data. Survival data were supplemented by descriptions of best and worst-case clinical scenarios. The tool also included prompts for clinician reflection designed to enhance awareness of cognitive biases that may affect prognostic accuracy. This online, open source COVID-19 Prognostication Tool has been made available to all clinicians at our institution and is updated weekly to reflect evolving data. Our COVID-19 Prognostication Tool may provide a useful approach to promoting consistent and high-quality prognostic communication across a healthcare system. objective and descriptive about likely clinical trajectories, providing patients and families with the information they need to imagine the implications of COVID-19 related critical illness and participate in informed decisions about values-based care. Studies to evaluate the utility of prognostic communication tools like this are needed.",

Clinicians at our institution are invited to use the tool as a source of information about major prognostic trajectories for this novel disease, as well as a reminder of the need to continuously re-calibrate our clinical impressions as new peerreviewed evidence emerges. Qualitative feedback on the tool has been positive, but we were not able to conduct a rigorous evaluation in the context of our pandemic response.",

            "text": "Our COVID-19 Prognostication Tool has several important limitations. First, the visual summary of patient outcomes is based on limited data from early studies and is likely to change as the pandemic evolves. Moreover, patient outcome data vary widely across studies due to length of study follow-up and regional differences in resource availability, treatment protocols, and approaches to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. Our team strives to update our visual summary of patient outcomes at least weekly with a concerted effort to capture pervasive, big-picture trends in survival. However, our interpretation of the data inevitably involves some degree of subjectivity. Second, this prognostication tool can only be useful when it is thoughtfully applied to the patient population and clinical circumstances for which it is intended: critically ill patients with COVID-19. Third, up-to-date and accurate prognostic information is only one step in effective prognostic communication with patients and family members. Supportive and effective communication of prognostic information is an important skill with multiple components, many of which are not addressed by this tool. 1, 19, 20 Fourth, our prognostication tool focuses on three cognitive biases that we observed at our institution but may not be universally applicable to all centers; reflection prompts may need to be adapted depending on the cognitive biases that are prevalent within each institutional culture. Finally, our evaluation of this tool is subjective and preliminary. Our goal was to share the tool quickly for others to adapt, implement, and evaluate in the context of this novel pandemic. Additional evaluation will be important to understand and improve the effectiveness of the tool.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, family visitation restrictions have heightened the risk of false consensus bias because these infection control measures inherently reduce opportunities for family members to interface with the medical team and initiate discussions about their loved one's values and goals. Patients and families with limited English proficiency, disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, face an additional barrier of needing an interpreter to communicate with the healthcare team. Due to these communication challenges, clinicians in the COVID-19 pandemic are less likely to learn about their patient's values and may subconsciously fill in knowledge gaps with inaccurate assumptions based on their own personal values.",

In all other circumstances, our goal should be to provide medically appropriate care that aligns with the patient's values (Figure 1). This reminder was placed at the beginning of the tool to explicitly name the risk of anchoring on Crisis Standards of Care and provide clinicians with the more appropriate, alternative reference point of Values-Based Care.Figures 2 and 3 provide a visual summary of outcome data from existing cohort studies of critically ill patients with COVID-19. 3-10 Studies were identified using a daily literature search that included (\"COVID-19\" OR \"SARS-CoV-2\") AND (\"critical care\" OR \"ICU\" OR \"critically ill\") AND (\"outcome\" OR \"mortality\" OR \"survival\"). Outcome data for critically ill patients with COVID-19 were reviewed independently by two authors, one trained in critical care, with a focus on clinical predictors of mortality. Based on published outcome data, we identified two broad categories of patients with contrasting prognostic trajectories useful to clinicians: 1) patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation with isolated lung involvement (generally <60-70 years old), and 2) patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation with multi-organ involvement and/or patients who were >70 years old. For each group, we created a visual summary of the approximate likelihood of successful extubation, death in the hospital, or prolonged intubation >2 weeks with uncertain final outcome (Figure 2). Reviewers reached consensus about the two categories of patients and their respective prognoses through discussion of the literature. The tool is updated weekly to reflect newly published results.",

These were based on both published data and the clinical experience at our institution. The best-case scenario for patients who require a prolonged course of intubation describes a typical recovery period after severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, emphasizing that recovery is often prolonged, on the order of months, with a new baseline that will likely include new functional deficits.18 This descriptive clinical scenario is provided in conjunction with estimated survival rates to provide a tangible reminder to clinicians of how a potential recovery might look. While recognizing that the likelihood of recovery may be small in some cases, we explicitly point out the possibility of recovery as a counterbalance to availability bias for clinicians who have recently cared for a dying patient and may be susceptible to inappropriate therapeutic nihilism.",
