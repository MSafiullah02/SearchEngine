            "text": "Together with proteins and nucleic acids, carbohydrates are a major class of biopolymers that mediate a wide range of biological processes in living organisms. It is now well established that, for example, carbohydrates play crucial roles in viral and bacterial invasion, angiogenesis and tumor cells metastasis, embryogenesis, inflammatory reactions, and, more generally speaking, in a large number of fundamental molecular recognition phenomena (Varki et al. 2009; Dwek 1996; Varki 1993). In particular, there is a growing interest towards what is known as glyco immunology: this term derives from the merger of glycobiology with immunology, and it deals with the peculiar interactions of carbohydrates with the immune system, emphasizing the importance of using carbohydrates to induce protective immunity against microbial infections but also cancer metastasis. This relatively new field is based on the concept that diverse pathogens and malignant cells expose on their surface a dense array of often unique glycan structures that exert a protective function against the host\u2019s immune defense and are essential for their pathogenicity. Typical examples are lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, the polysaccharide coat (capsular polysaccharides, CPS) of encapsulated bacteria, and diverse glycoproteins/glycolipids specifically expressed on viral and cancer cell surface. On the other hand, all these glycoforms are capable of interacting with the immune system, acting as cell antigenic determinants, and raising carbohydrate-specific antibodies production, and therefore they represent attractive targets for vaccine development.",

            "text": "Vaccination has certainly been a key breakthrough in the history of medicine and produced a tremendous impact on health-care systems. It is therefore not surprising that, despite the advent of more and more sophisticated antibiotics, vaccination is still considered by the World Health Organization as the most cost-effective approach for preventing infectious diseases and protecting public health, especially in developing countries. There is however a general concern about carbohydrate-based vaccines. Vaccines based on free and purified polysaccharides are poorly immunogenic in infants, in young children (under 2 years of age), in the elderly, and in immunocompromised patients, since they induce only short-lasting antibody responses in adults and fail to generate conventional B cell-mediated immunological memory (Gonzalez-Fernandez et al. 2008; Segal and Pollard 2004). Polysaccharide-based vaccines thereby possess limited clinical efficacy that has been largely ascribed to the T cell-independent immune response, hallmarked by the exclusive production of low-affinity IgM antibodies and no class switch to high-affinity protective IgG antibodies. This kind of immune response is typically triggered by antigens with polymeric structure composed of multiple repeating units, such as polysaccharides (Mond et al. 1995). The discovery that the polysaccharide immunogenicity can be strongly enhanced by their conjugation to an immunogenic carrier proteinled to the development of glycoconjugate vaccines (Lesinski and Westerink 2001; Weintraub 2003). This strategy opened a new era in the field of vaccinology. Glycoconjugate antigens are able to induce T cell recruitment and immune memory B cell proliferation, with the production of long-lasting IgG antibodies specifically directed towards the carbohydrate strictly associated to the pathogen (Ada and Isaacs 2003). The isolation and purification of carbohydrate antigens from their natural sources, and their subsequent manipulation for protein conjugation, are however a challenging task. In addition, the material available is often heterogeneous and not sufficient for the inclusion in a vaccine, and these represent major limitations to further expansion in this field. Hence, the development of cost-effective, fully synthetic carbohydrate vaccines would be of great importance, as witnessed by the spectacular success of the Cuban vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Verez-Bencomo et al. 2004). Synthetic carbohydrate antigens have, indeed, defined composition, and they can be produced as homogeneous compounds in a controlled manner with little or no batch-to-batch variability, affording highly reproducible biological properties. In addition, some microorganisms express carbohydrate structures that have close similarity to mammalian tissue-specific structures, and this molecular mimicry may induce tolerance by the host\u2019s immune system. One approach to evade this immune tolerance is to use a chemically modified version of the carbohydrate, an option available only with the recourse to the chemical synthesis. The unnatural structure will be perceived as a foreign antigen by the host, but at the same time, it should elicit antibodies able to cross-react with the natural glycan expressed on the pathogen cell surface.",

The reaction proceeds under phase-transfer conditions using a stoichiometric amount of Ac2O and 33 % HBr in AcOH: thioglycosides 4, 6, and 8 were obtained by further addition of p-thiocresol and (nBu)4NHSO4, while glycosyl azides 5, 7, and 9 were prepared by adding NaN3 instead of p-thiocresol (Scheme 1).\n",

To design an ideal one-pot glycosylation, it is important to know the \u201crelative reactivity\u201d of a variety of glycosides. In 1999 Wong and coworkers performed a competitive HPLC experiment in order to obtain informations on the reactivity of different glycosyl donors (Zhang et al. 1999). The study was carried out using STol glycosides (easy to prepare) for their intrinsic characteristics, such as stability during protecting groups manipulations and the possibility to study the reactivity via HPLC due to the presence of an aromatic ring. The relative reactivity values (RRVs) for each thioglycosyl donor were obtained by comparison of peracetylated tolylthiomannoside (RRV = 1.0). In particular, high values of RRV represent donors with high reactivity. The authors revealed interesting trends in the reactivity of thioglycoside donors, in particular: (1) pyranosides show reactivities that differ as a function of the sugar (fucose > galactose > mannose > glucose > sialic acid), (2) the reactivity of amino sugars can be tuned by the N-protecting groups (NHCbz > NHTroc > NHPhth > N3 > NHAc), (3) the protecting groups greatly influence the reactivity properties (in particular the substitution at C-2 plays a significant role), (4) the position that mostly affects pyranosides reactivity is not always the same for all sugars, (5) the magnitude of any protecting group reactivity effect is influenced by its position on the pyranoside, and (6) influence of leaving group like steric effects (the reactivity of the glycosyl donor can be tuned by changing the size of its leaving group) and electronic effects. In addition, it was found that, for each sugar, conformational effects (torsional effects) and solvent effects may be crucial to determine the RRVs.",

SPOS offers two main advantages: (1) only a single purification by chromatography is needed in most cases at the end of the synthesis and (2) unwanted reagents and side products can be easily removed by washing and filtering. Due to the significant improvements in carbohydrate chemistry, during the past decade, there has been a great development of solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis, confirmed by the numerous contributions reported in the literature (Seeberger and Haase 2000; Seeberger 2001; Danishefsky et al. 1993; Randolph et al. 1995; Rademann and Schmidt 1996; Roussel et al. 2000; Jonke et al. 2006; Nicolaou et al. 1997, 1998). In particular, an automated oligosaccharide synthesizer was developed by Seeberger and coworkers by modification of a peptide synthesizer (Plante et al. 2001; Seeberger 2008) and employed for the synthesis of the nonasaccharide of Ley-Lex (KH-1) antigen derivative 84 (Scheme 14) (Love and Seeberger 2004).\n",

In 2010 Boons and coworkers developed a 1,2-cis-glycosylation strategy driven by the protection at C-2 with a chiral auxiliary (Scheme 16) (Boltje et al. 2010). Using (S)-(phenylthiomethyl)benzyl chiral auxiliary as a protecting group at position 2 of the glycosyl donor, the glycosylation proceeds via a trans decalin ring intermediate (equatorial sulfonium ion) allowing the stereoselective formation of 1,2-cis-glycosidic bond. In particular, with this procedure, the authors were able to synthesize a branched pentasaccharide 99 with different 1,2-cis-glycosidic linkages in 13 % overall yield (corresponding to 86 % yield per step). Another advantage of the chiral protecting group is that it can be converted into an acyl group on the solid support under conditions compatible with the removal of the temporary groups.\n",

The tagging can be obtained either by site-selective protein modification or by selective protein tagging. The former approach involves site-specific chemical modification under mild conditions of natural residues, such as cysteine, its elimination product, and dehydroalanine, which are well suited for thiol-ene reaction and Michael addition (Bernardes et al. 2008; Lin et al. 2008; Chalker et al. 2011b). Even more interesting is the selective protein-tagging approach. This methodology relies on the insertion of nonnatural amino acids (UAAs) into proteins by genetically reprogramming the translation cascade in E. coli. Translation has a great intrinsic capacity to be adapted to accommodate new building blocks, since the relationship between the template (mRNA) and the product (polypeptide) is defined by the genetic code, which utilizes aminoacyl-tRNA adapters to establish the map between mRNA and the protein sequence.",

            "text": "In addition to the abovementioned problems, another important aspect should also be taken into account when designing glycoconjugate vaccines. Due to the presence of diverse T cell epitopes, carrier proteins are highly immunogenic and therefore elicit strong T cell responses, which can overcome that of the saccharide moiety (especially in the case of very short oligosaccharide fragments) causing hapten suppression (Herzenberg and Tokuhisa 1980). The use of a single peptide as a T cell epitope should give rise to a more robust immune response, more specifically directed towards the carbohydrate antigen. To address this issue, over the last decade, a number of computer algorithms that map the locations of MHC-restricted T cell epitopes within proteins of various origins have been developed. As a result, it has been found that some sequence regions of protein antigens might sensitize CD4+ cells (Weber et al. 2009). This finding led to the identification of small and simple TH peptide epitopes that are chemically defined, easily synthesized by SPPS, and able to generate effective helper T cell responses in humans. Among them, the Pan HLA DR-binding Epitope (PADRE), OVA323\u2013339 and YAF peptides, TT heptapeptide, and tridecapeptide from poliovirus are widely used (Panina-Bordignon et al. 1989; Diethelm-Okita et al. 1997, 2000).",

The name comes from the Greek word \u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (dendron), which translates to \u201ctree\u201d (Astruc et al. 2010). Dendritic molecules are characterized by structural perfection: they are monodisperse and usually highly symmetric around the core, adopting a globular three-dimensional morphology. Dendritic molecules can be categorized into low-molecular weight and high-molecular weight species. The first class includes dendrimers and dendrons, while the latter comprises dendronized polymers, hyperbranched polymers, and polymer brushes. Dendrimers can be considered to have three major portions: a core, an inner shell, and an outer shell. In principle, a dendrimer can bear different functionalities in each of these portions to control properties such as solubility, thermal stability, and attachment of compounds for specific applications. Synthetic processes can also precisely control the size and number of branches on the dendrimer. Such molecules can be assembled following two different approaches. In the divergent method, the dendrimer is assembled from a multifunctional core, which is extended outward by a series of reactions. However, each step must be driven to completion in order to avoid mistakes in the dendrimer, which can cause trailing generations (some branches are shorter than others, Fig. 6a). On the other hand, in the convergent methods, dendrimers are built from small molecules that end up at the surface of the sphere, and reactions proceed inward to the center core (Fig. 6b). This method makes it much easier to remove impurities and shorter branches. However dendrimers made this way cannot be as large as those made by divergent methods because of crowding due to steric effects around the core.\n",

They proposed a new family of model glycoclusters and glycodendrimers, decorated with N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) termini, that can be assembled through a divergent original \u201conion peel strategy.\u201d High chemo- and regioselective photolytic thiol-ene coupling (TEC) and thiol-yne coupling (TYC) were used to rapidly and sequentially grow the dendritic architectures and to install a high degree of branching (Dondoni and Marra 2012; Gingras et al. 2013). Further branching (up to 36 valences) was added by EDC-mediated esterifications (or amidations) of polypropargylated dendrons (such as 119), to which the LacNAc azide derivative 120 was attached by \u201cclick chemistry\u201d (Scheme 25). As far as the biological relevance is concerned, LacNAc represents a part of the Lewisx and Lewisy tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (Heimburg-Molinaro et al. 2011), and it is known to possess strong binding affinities towards galectins, a cancer-associated family of proteins (Zhou 2003; Liu and Rabinovich 2005; Salatino et al. 2008; Rabinovich and Toscano 2009). Therefore, a protein binding study was carried out with a model leguminous lectin from Erythrina cristagalli agglutinin (ECA). Interestingly, the glycodendrimers exhibited high relative potencies, with an up to 216-fold enhancement in global affinity with respect to the reference monomer.\n",

Moreover, polyglycerols are suitable as inert carriers for biomedical applications, as they are considered biocompatible and non-immunogenic.

Typical TACAs of mucins include Tn, sTn (NeuAc\u03b12-6GalNAc), and TF, \u03b1-O-glycosylated to serine/threonine residues in the peptide backbone (Heimburg-Molinaro et al. 2011; Pashov et al. 2011). The resulting construct 122 was shown to induce a strong immune response in mice, raising IgG antibodies able to recognize human breast cancer cells.\n",

They reported the synthesis and immunological evaluation of several multivalent, fully synthetic, glycopeptide-based antitumor vaccines (Ragupathi et al. 2006). The authors speculated that the combination of several carbohydrate antigens closely associated with a particular cancer type could induce a more robust immune response, decreasing the percentage of tumor cells that can elude an immunological response. The constructs were assembled following a unimolecular multivalent approach, where several distinct TACAs are displayed on a single peptide backbone (Kim and Varki 1997). A sequential assembly of the glycopeptide in order of carbohydrate size, from the smallest (Tn) to the largest and most complex one (Globo H), was performed. The functionalized carbohydrate antigens were prepared either by manipulation of glycal epoxides or sulfonylaziridines, whereas the spacers were built through Horner-Emmons reactions followed by asymmetric hydrogenation or by cross-metathesis (Fig. 7). The results coming from mice immunization point out that the immunological properties of the individual antigens are preserved in the multivalent structures. However, it seems also that the immunogenicity is influenced by the position of the antigen on the peptide backbone. Overall, the antibodies showed significant reactivity with all three cell lines tested (MCF-7, LSC, DU-145). These vaccine candidates are now at the stage of evaluation in clinical trials.\n",

The Q11 domain could aggregate in solution, under mild conditions, into fibers over 200 nm long, thus displaying multivalent B cell epitopes on the fiber surface, and it served both as adjuvant and vaccine carrier (Rudra et al. 2010).

Since then, comprehensive studies have been carried out on the influence of loading, presentation of the ligands (i.e., type and length of the linker), and core size on the interaction with the specific receptor (Marradi et al. 2013; Fallarini et al. 2013; Reynolds et al. 2013; de la Fuente and Penades 2006; Manea et al. 2008).

To this end, a glycopolymer displaying multiple copies of the Tn antigen was used to coat and stabilize the surface of GNPs. First of all, a Tn-antigen glycan bearing a polymerizable linker 125 was prepared and then converted by Reversible Addition Fragmentation chain Transfer polymerization technique (RAFT) into various PEG block copolymers with different glycan densities and chain lengths (Scheme 29). Sodium borohydride was finally used to reduce the dithioester end groups of the polymers to thiol and to simultaneously produce GNPs in situ.

The odd-numbered homologues (n = 5, 7, 9), although known in the literature, are rarely used, as they require more complicated syntheses. The considerable success met by calixarenes, especially calix[4]arenes, as scaffolds for the construction of multivalent ligands can be ascribed to a combination of different factors. Among them, the ease to modulate valency, size, structure, and topology of the binding group presentation, together with the possibility to keep them conformationally mobile to exploit an induced-fit binding, or, in contrast, to lock them in a more preorganized specific structure. In fact, while the tetramethoxy and tetraethoxy derivatives are conformationally mobile, the selective introduction of larger groups can lock the macrocycle into one of the four possible conformations. These structures were named by Gutsche as cone, partial cone, 1,3-alternate, and 1,2-alternate (Fig. 9) and are characterized by a remarkably different spatial orientation of the phenolic units.\n",

According to the WHO, the most cost-effective strategy for controlling infections caused by pathogenic microorganisms is the vaccination practice, which should confer long-term protective immunity on the population. Carbohydrate-based vaccines, specifically designed to target pathogen-specific cell surface saccharide structures, showed enormous potential benefits for human health. In particular, it has been ascertained that optimal protection of the population, including newborns and young children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients, may be achieved with the administration of glycoconjugate vaccines that convert the T cell-independent immune response typical of plain polysaccharides into a T cell-dependent response, thereby establishing immunological memory.",

This could be a crucial feature to improve batch-to-batch consistency in vaccine manufacturing and to confer a better safety profile. In addition, synthetic oligosaccharides can be valuable tools for epitope recognition, i.e., to identify within the polysaccharide antigen the minimal structural requirements needed to elicit a protective immune response.",

Some of the most innovative approaches that emerged during the last years in the field of vaccinology are therefore based on the concept that a fully competent immune response targeting poorly immunogenic synthetic carbohydrate antigens may be achieved by including in the vaccine setting only those elements strictly required to elicit a robust carbohydrate-specific immune response, devoid of any unnecessary component. Accordingly, there is a growing interest towards new kind of vaccines where the protein carrier is replaced by a synthetic short peptide able to act as a T cell epitope and to enhance the immunogenicity of the carbohydrate antigen. These new constructs include also fully synthetic vaccines exploiting the multivalency effect, where a significant enhancement of the immunogenicity is achieved by display of multiple copies of the oligosaccharide antigen on a suitable polyfunctional scaffold. A variety of scaffolds with different molecular architectures and chemical properties have been developed and applied during the last years, giving rise to new and very promising vaccine candidates that could open a new front line in vaccinology.",
