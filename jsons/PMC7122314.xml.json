Led by the late Mahbub ul Haq, the report introduces human security as a new concept that equates security with people rather than with territorial states. It is a move to inject distinctiveness and separation into how the notion of security should be perceived. By collectively pushing for a wide arrangement of people-centered projects, it is meant to be an \u2018integrative\u2019 concept as opposed to a \u2018defensive\u2019 one.",

Historical wars were mainly about the survival of states and regimes rather than the protection of the people from threats. Thus, lives were sacrificed in the name of country and nation. Even then, it has not resolved the many conflicts that continue to occur within states and among societies such as the South Thailand conflict, the Rohingyas issue and the Xinjiang unrest. The problem lies in the delineation of territories either fought through wars or colonialism that failed to properly capture the composition of various ethnic groups. In short, the arrangement of the international system was based primarily on states rather than on societies. In many instances, societies were required to organize themselves within the boundaries that had been predetermined and pledge allegiance to their respective states even if they found it difficult to accept. Cases that have led to unfortunate bloodshed such as in the Balkans clearly showed what happens when there is a grave mismatch between nation building and societal make-up. Irredentist hegemony and migration across borders further complicate matters and generate international concern in a globalized world.",

For decades, North Korea\u2019s paranoia with national security has brought about widespread suffering and refugee outflow of its people (see 10.1007/978-94-007-1799-2_0). As the world emerged from the ashes of the Cold War and as globalization becomes manifested in every layer and spectrum of the global society, the meaning of security has to be broadened beyond the typical narrative. This means putting in the human dimension that has been lost in oblivion. To do so, the 1994 report explicitly defined the term as having two important components: the freedom from want and the freedom from fear. The former focuses on the \u201c\u2026safety from such chronic threats as hunger, disease and repression\u201d that reflects a slow and silent process and the latter on the \u201c\u2026protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions in the patterns of daily life\u201d that reflect \u201can abrupt, loud emergency\u201d (UNDP 1994: 23\u201324). Furthermore, the report identified seven key areas of the human security concept deemed important: economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security and political security.0 Many of these areas are in fact touched upon by the contributors of this book.",

It defined the term along the lines of the UNDP report but put a greater stress on threats such as human rights abuse and terrorism that directly affect individual\u2019s rights and safety (Bajpai 2000: 36). Together with Norway, a Human Security Partnership was established in May 1998 to address landmine and child soldier issues, among others. A year later, Canada led a group of like-minded countries, who gathered in Lys\u00f8en, Norway, to push for the concept as a policy agenda, defining it as \u201cfreedom from pervasive threats to people\u2019s rights, the safety or even their lives\u201d.0 Furthermore, that year saw the launching of human security under the United Nations Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD) that sought to integrate the concept into sustainable development strategies at the regional and local levels.",

In response, the Government of Japan initiated the establishment of the Commission on Human Security (CHS) in 2001, which lasted for 2 years.0 Co-chaired by former UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, the CHS took on the task of defining and developing the concept as an operational tool for policy implementation. Its 2003 report, Human Security Now, incorporates two approaches \u2013 bottom-up and top-down. The former \u201cconcentrates on empowering people\u201d through development programs that \u201ccan best attained in a community context\u201d while the latter puts the onus on the state to protect the people\u2019s well-being through sound \u201crule of law and judicial institutions\u201d (Ogata 2006: 2\u20133). Despite some shortcomings, the combination of the two approaches is thought to provide the framework for human security.0\n",

For the latter two, human security ought to be defined in a narrower form based particularly on the \u2018freedom from fear\u2019 and should thus focus on the two areas of political and personal securities \u2013 protection from political oppression and physical violence. The remaining five areas (economic, food, health, environmental, and community securities) are considered more suited to human development, which the two countries felt were already being pursued under various UN programs, and therefore a clear distinction should be made between human security and human development (Alkire 2003). Instead of prioritizing one over the other, Japan, on the other hand, followed the 1994 UNDP report that saw a need to pursue human security in its broadest sense, arguing that access to food and clean water as well as freedom from diseases and natural disasters affects the survival of individuals and are therefore of equal importance.0\n",

Therein lies the difficult challenge of addressing the issue of humanitarian intervention due to the overarching principles of sovereignty and non-interference in domestic affairs. One of the earliest efforts to address this concern was the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, set up in 2000 and largely sponsored by Canada. In their 2001 report, the Commission sought to emphasize that sovereignty is not about \u201ccontrol\u201d but about \u201cresponsibility\u201d. Sovereignty does not only mean respect for the territorial integrity of other states but the responsibility to respect and protect the dignity and safety of citizens. This dual meaning showed resoluteness to hold national authorities accountable for their actions within their geographical borders and signified that the international community through the UN has a responsibility to act collectively should states fail to uphold their basic duties. The meaning of sovereignty and intervention is thus broadened to cover individuals \u2013 the core focus of human security. It also strengthened the notion of human rights as being universal.",

This endorsement was again reiterated under the three freedoms \u2013 freedom from want, freedom from fear and freedom to live in dignity \u2013 that formed the UN Secretary-General\u2019s proposed agenda for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly (World Summit) in September 2005. At the Summit, the world leaders came to consensus that \u201c[e]ach individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\u201d (UN 2005b: 31).0 This was a momentous breakthrough particularly for the enhancement of freedom from extreme fear and reflected the changing tide of politico-security values.",

The first pillar reinforces the 2005 endorsement that places the responsibility to protect civilians from harm squarely on the state. The message was clear \u2013 the UN opposes atrocities, unlawful killings and systematic attacks by states on their vulnerable populations. In 2010, the Secretary-General took the R2P a step further by addressing early warning and assessment capabilities.

However, the UN has yet to provide an exact and legal definition of human security and as such the term remains contested. The difficulty of providing a precise definition stems from the different approach that human security takes in comparison to state-focused security such as the common, cooperative and comprehensive securities previously discussed. In critically asking \u201c[i]f the values of the person conflict with the values of the state, which prevail?\u201d, Acharya argued that human security \u201cis certainly not new wine in an old bottle. Comprehensive security answered the question: which threats to state security? Human security answers \u2018whose security\u2019?\u201d (2001: 453\u2013454).",

For human security to take a stronger hold there is a need for greater recognition of the values of individuals and communities vis-\u00e0-vis the states. This does not necessarily imply that human and state securities are stacked on opposite ends but more needs to be done to bring human security issues to the forefront of international attention.

After all, shouldn\u2019t that be the focus of East Asian regionalism? Is the effort to build an ASEAN community and subsequently an East Asian community through the ASEAN+3 and the East Asia Summit frameworks for states or for the people? For too long, ASEAN has been criticized for being an organization catering solely to the interest of its member states. This is perhaps best reflected in former Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan\u2019s speech in 2002 when he said,\nIn 1998, at the time the idea of flexible engagement was proposed at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ministerial meeting, I proposed the creation of a \u00ad\u201ccaucus for social safety nets.\u201d None of my ASEAN colleagues supported me. Most of the support came from outside ASEAN, particularly the West\u2014Australia, the United States, Russia, and even India. I proposed a caucus of social safety nets because all of a sudden millions of our people had slid back into poverty and they needed help to sustain them through the crisis. My colleagues thought the idea was another Western idea and another way of coming through the back door in order to interfere with the internal affairs of member states. So we should not underestimate the problems, the resistance, the doubt that could occur as we work to shift from the supremacy of the state to a focus on individuals (2002: 56; emphasis added).\n",

According to the ASEAN Charter, the purposes of ASEAN, among many, are \u201cto alleviate poverty\u2026; to enhance the well-being and livelihood of the peoples of ASEAN\u2026; to strengthen cooperation in building a safe, secure and drug-free environment for the peoples of ASEAN; to promote a people-oriented ASEAN\u2026\u201d (2008: 4\u20135). If these aims are what ASEAN sets out to achieve, then the significance of human security to the future of Southeast Asia is obvious. Coupled with the role that Japan has been playing in promoting human securityo, such similar purposes as outlined by ASEAN should aptly apply to the wider regional agenda in securing the future of East Asia as well. In fact, the East Asia Vision Group report that was produced in 2001 for the ASEAN+3 cooperation identified \u201cpeople focus\u201d as one of the guiding principles, explaining that \u201ctheir security, welfare and happiness are our ultimate goal\u201d (2001: 8). Therefore, regional security frameworks such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, which has been disparaged for its inability to move beyond the first phase of confidence building, should be reconfigured into a body for the championing of human security concerns (Teh 2009).",

The author argues that the refugee issue highlights the ineffectiveness of the human security paradigm in transcending the deep-rooted traditional security agenda and views ethics and morality as indispensable in creating a sustainable security culture of reconciliation. 10.1007/978-94-007-1799-2_2 takes up the issue of health security, focusing on the vulnerability of women to HIV transmission in mainland China. Chinese women, due to the patriarchal nature of the society, will continue to suffer from the lack of empowerment and remain highly insecure unless a gendered response to HIV based on international best practices is appropriately enforced. Empowerment is undeniably the key to forestalling the spread of communicable diseases. 10.1007/978-94-007-1799-2_3 looks at the historical trend of population policy in Vietnam and its relations to human security. In discussing Vietnam\u2019s demographic changes, the author shows that the level of transition from state to human security approaches in the four important areas of migration, reproductive rights, food supply and the environment, and minority rights has remained unclear due to various internal and external developments.",

In contrast to the previous chapter that looks at migrants in the country, 10.1007/978-94-007-1799-2_5 discusses the dynamics of interaction between the state and society in the Philippines concerning Filipino labor migrants abroad.

Looking at intra- and extra-regional factors the author points out that addressing insecurity is a complex process that depends on dynamic interactions of actors at various levels and can only be fully tackled if ample space is created for the voices of those directly affected to be heard. 10.1007/978-94-007-1799-2_7 takes issue with the environment as well but fixes squarely on the inability of ASEAN to mitigate the ill effects of climate change due to its outdated diplomatic culture.
