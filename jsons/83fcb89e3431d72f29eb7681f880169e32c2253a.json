            "text": "During the last years our society was often exposed to the coherent information waves of high amplitudes. These are waves of huge social energy. Often they are of the destructive character, a kind of information tsunami. But, they can carry as well positive improvements in the human society, as waves of decision making matching rational recommendations of societal institutes. The main distinguishing features of these waves are their high amplitude, coherence (homogeneous character of social actions generated by them), and short time needed for their generation and relaxation. Such waves can be treated as large scale exhibition of the Bandwagon effect. We show that this socio-psychic phenomenon can be modeled on the basis of the recently developed social laser theory. This theory can be used to model stimulated amplification of coherent social actions. \"Actions\" are treated very generally, from mass protests to votes and other collective decisions, as, e.g., acceptance (often unconscious) of some societal recommendations. In this paper, we concentrate on theory of laser resonators, physical vs. social. For the latter, we analyze in very detail functioning of the internet based Echo-Chambers. Their main purpose is increasing of the power of the quantum information field as well as its coherence. Of course, the Bandwagon effect is well known and well studied in social psychology. However, the social laser theory gives the possibility to model it by using the general formalism of quantum field theory. The paper contains minimum of mathematics and it can be readable by researchers working in psychology, cognitive, social, and political sciences; it might also be interesting for experts in information theory and artificial intelligence. keywords: coherent information waves, social energy, quantumlike modeling in decision making, social laser model, resonator, Echo Chamber.",

The basic distinguishing property of such waves is that they carry huge amount of social energy. Thus, they are not just the waves widely distributing some special information content throughout the human society. In contrast, their information contents are very restricted. Typically, the content carried by a wave is reduced to one (or a few) labels; we can say \"colors\": one wave is \"green\", another is \"yellow\". At the same time information waves carry very big emotional charge, a lot of social energy. So, they can have strong destructive as well as constructive impact on the human society. In this note, we present a model of generation of very powerful and coherent information waves; the model based on the recently developed theory of social laser [1]- [6] .",

This terminology was invented by the author to distinguish this modeling from attempts to reduce human consciousness, cognition, and consequently behavior to genuine quantum physical processes in the brain (see, e.g., Penrose [29] or Hameroff [30] ). We do not criticize the genuine quantum physical approach to cognition (and consciousness). Some insights from it were useful for the social laser project; in particular, the latter was influenced by works on the quantum field theory of cognition, by Ricciardi, Umezawa [31] and Vittiello [32, 33] .",

Another aim of this work is present the nutshell of the social lasing theory with minimal appealing to the mathematical formalism (cf. with the formal presentation in previous works [1] - [6] ).

Our aim is different. We want to formalize quantum features of information systems (including humans) which can lead to generation of big information waves. The waves having very high degree of coherence, i.e., homogeneity with respect to communications' content. Nowadays, the mathematical formalism and the methodology of quantum theory are widely used in psychology, decision making, cognitive, social, and political sciences, game theory, economics and finance 1 . There is a plenty of statistical data confirming that the quantum-like probabilistic model match these data better than the classical one. These data was originally collected without any relation to quantum-like modeling, mainly in cognitive psychology, behavioral economics and finance, and game theory. Such statistical data was connected to irrational behavior of humans, see, e.g., the pioneer works of Kahneman (the Nobel prize in behavioral economics) and Tversky [47, 48] . Later, it became clear that these irrationality related data can be consistently modeled with the aid of the probability counterpart of the quantum formalism [16, 17] . In particular, this approach resolved all basic paradoxes of classical decision theory such as Allais (1953) , Ellsberg (1961) or Machina (2009) paradoxes [49, 50, 51] .",

Echo Chambers improve the coherence of the information flow through the statistical elimination of communications that do not match the main stream. This statistical elimination is a consequence of the bosonic nature of the quantum information field (sections 2.9, 4.4). Although this quantum process of coherence generation dominates in Echo Chambers, we should not ignore other technicalities increasing coherence (sections 6.2, 6.3), such as censorship of moderators and the dynamical evaluation system of search engines of, e.g., Google, YouTube, or Yandex. The latter system elevates approachability of posts, comments, and videos depending on the history of their reading (seeing) and reactions to them say in the form of new comments.",

Thus, this is a kind of reflector-multiplier (section 4.3). As the result of this multiplication effect, social resonators are more effective than physical ones. However, as in physics, resonator's efficiency depends on a variety of parameters. One of such parameters is the coefficient of reflection-multiplication (section 6.1).

Then a coherent bunch of photons is injected into the gain medium and this bunch stimulates the cascade process of emission of the coherent photon-beam. If the power of pumping is very high, i.e., it is higher than the so-called lasing threshold, all energy of pumping is transferred into the output beam of coherent radiation. To make this beam essentially stronger, the laser is equipped by an additional component, laser's resonator (typically in the form of optical cavity). Laser's resonator also improves coherence of the output beam, by eliminating from the beam, photons that were generated via spontaneous emission in the gain medium [45] .",

We remark that a photon also has additional characteristics such as polarization, the quantum version of the ordinary polarization of light.

The probability of emission of a quantum of the fixed quasi-color \u03b1 depends on the power of the field's mode colored by \u03b1.

We again use the analogy with physics. In the process of lasing, the dynamical feed back process in the cavity excludes the excitation of the electromagnetic field propagating in the wrong directions. In this way, laser generates the sharply directed beam of light. However, one may want some additional specification for excitations in the light beam. For example, one wants that all photons would be of the same polarization. It can be easily done by putting the additional filter, the polarization filter, that eliminates from the beam all photons with \"wrong polarization\". Of course, the use of an additional filter would weaker the power of the output beam. The latter is the price for coherence increasing. In social lasing, the role of such polarization filters is played by say Google, Face Book, Instagram, or Yandex control filtering, e.g., with respect to the political correctness constraints. Besides numerous moderators, this filtering system uses the keywords search engines as well as the rigid system of \"self-control\". In the latter, users report on \"wrongly colored posts and comments\" of each other; the reports are directed both to the provider and to social groups -to attract the attention to such posts and comments.",

The main distinguishing feature of the latter is its ability not only reflect excitations of the quantum information field, but also multiply them in number.

We do not plan to discuss here the Freud's hydrodynamical model for psychic energy transformations. We want to elevate the crucial difference of the energy transfer from the information field to social atoms from the energy transfer from the electromagnetic field to physical atoms. In physics, energy is assigned to photons carriers of information, an atom by absorbing a photon receives its energy. In our social model, an excitation of the information field just carries the social energy label E c . A social atom absorbs this label and generate the corresponding portion of energy by itself, by transforming its psychical energy into the social energy. And the former is generated by neurophysiological activity in the brain and the nervous system from the physical metabolic energy. Thus by taking into account the psychic energy, we understand that even for cognitive systems the law of energy conservation is not violated.",
