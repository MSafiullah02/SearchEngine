Yet the development of vaccines remains largely trapped in the past, a hostage to the methodology of Pasteur. Infectious disease continues to threaten humanity, with new and renascent diseases emerging continually. The last two decades have seen a breath-taking revival in the commercial market for vaccines and the simultaneous emergence of a whole tranche of new technologies that promise to free vaccine development from the muddle of empirical thinking. In this short introduction, we set the scene for this renaissance, and explore how the combination of computational and experimental techniques promise so much for the future development of vaccines and the science of vaccinology.",

At the same time, the great killers of today, cancer and heart disease, brought about no more than 12 % of deaths. Journey back another two hundred years-to the dying days of the seventeenth century-and average life expectancy seldom exceeded four decades. The main causes of death were again contagious disease: tuberculosis, smallpox, yellow fever, malaria, and dysentery, affecting infants, children, and adults, all alike. In the early years of the twenty-first century, things are radically different. Infectious disease is responsible for less than 2 % of deaths in the developed world, while chronic disease causes over 60 % of deaths.",

Yet today smallpox has, with the exception of a few well-guarded stockpiles, been completely eradicated: there have been no new cases for 30 years. The story of smallpox is thus the high point of the vaccination story; no other disease has been eradicated. Polio or poliomyelitis is the next nearest to full eradication, having long been targeted by a systematic, coordinated, worldwide eradication campaign. In 1991, one such programme run by the Pan American Health Organization effected a partial eradication of polio in the western hemisphere. Subsequently, the Global Polio Eradication Program has radically reduced polio throughout the rest of the world, so that today we can count cases worldwide in the tens or hundreds instead of the hundreds-of-thousands or millions.",

Perhaps the most execrable situation is measles, which accounts for 70,000 (over 5) and 540,000 (under 5) deaths. However, the leading global causes of death worldwide remain tuberculosis; diarrhoeal illnesses, especially rotaviruses; HIV/AIDS; and malaria. In 2010, 8.8 million contracted TB and 1.4 million died. Disturbing though these numbers may seem, they nonetheless represent a significant reversal of a once ever-escalating trend.

And as for tuberculosis-which is carried by around 2 billion people worldwide-the only licensed vaccine has limited efficacy. Many viral infections remain recalcitrant threats of the first order. About 350 million people are infected with hepatitis B, 170 million by hepatitis C, and 40 million by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This dire situation is further compounded by the threat from the 35 new or previously unknown infectious diseases identified in the past 30 years: HIV, West Nile fever, Ebola, dengue fever, SARS, and the potentially pandemic H5N1 influenza. Every year, between 5 and 15 % of the global population becomes infected with a new influenza strain, causing upwards of half-a-million deaths.

Therapeutic vaccines against cancer are probably the best studied amongst the more novel, innovative, and underexplored areas at the forefront of vaccine discovery. The present overall whole-life risk from cancer, at least in developed countries, runs at or about 40 %. The figure is currently rising. There are approximately 3\u00b72 million new cancer cases in Europe each year, resulting in around 1\u00b77 million deaths. In the USA, over one and half million new cases are reported annually.

Versatility and flexibility are major hallmarks of the vaccination concept. Vaccines take many forms and work in many ways. This facet has been exploited in the development of life-style vaccines. Let us look at serious addiction. During 2009, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated 3.3-6.1 % of the global population abused so-called illicit substances-a serious problem indeed with an enormous implicit health, economic, and behavioural burden, with the worst excesses coming from cannabis abuse and the abuse of amphetamine, cocaine, and opiates. Anti-drug vaccines generate antibodies able to bind particular drugs; the drug-antibody complexes thus generated should have too high a molecular weight to penetrate the blood-brain barrier effectively, thus reducing the amount and rate of drug egress into the brain and so inhibiting psychoactive effects at the system level. Anti-addiction vaccines have been with us for some time, beginning over 40 years ago, when two proof-of-principle studies [2, 3] demonstrated in rats and in rhesus monkeys that morphine could be used as a hapten in order to create an antibody against morphine addiction. Today, addiction vaccines are being developed to target a range of major abused drugs, such as nicotine, cocaine, various amphetamines, and heroin.",

Likewise, there are hundreds upon hundreds of vaccines in trials. The growth rate in the sales of vaccines reflects this feverish and febrile activity: The rate of sales growth for vaccines is something like 16 %, compared to the sluggish drugs market, meandering its desultory way at 4 % per annum. There is profit in vaccines, clearly; what remains problematic for the profit-driven decision-making processes of big pharma is the haphazard and probabilistic nature of vaccine discovery.

Indeed, the co-delivery and continued association of antigen and adjuvant may be a prerequisite in effective immunisation. This is not a new idea; the ability of alum to promote an antigen depot effect at the site of action has been ascribed as one of its main mechanisms of action for several years. For example, since 1977 the WHO has recommended that over 80 % of diphtheria toxoid needs to be adsorbed to alum for its effective use [4] . Whilst this does not ensure that the antigen remains adsorbed to alum after injection and exposure to interstitial fluid, it is thought to at least initially promote colocation of the antigen with the alum adjuvant. However, alum is not the only adjuvant able to promote the co-delivery of antigens and adjuvants in one system; a range of particulate delivery systems can offer this. Examples of such delivery systems include lipid-based systems (e.g., liposomes, niosomes, ISCOMs) and microparticles. Each of these systems offer a suite of advantages and disadvantages and when considering the choice of delivery system attributes including antigenloading capacity, antigen retention and protection both on storage and within the biological milieu, and the ability to incorporate adjuvants within the delivery system all require optimisation and this is without consideration of the ability of the delivery system to act as an adjuvant in its own right. In this book we aim to address these issues by considering several of the most commonly employed particulate vaccine delivery systems.",

Since then, a large array of understanding on their design has been gathered and strong links between their formulation and function identified. Of these parameters, the composition of the liposomes will play a pivotal role. For example, the surface charge of liposomes used for vaccine delivery can influence the interactions between liposomes and protein antigens, and affect how liposomes interact with cells. This manipulation of surface charge can range from the inclusion of anionic lipids such as phosphatidylserine, which may facilitate the targeting of antigen presenting cells through interaction with phosphatidylserine receptors. Alternatively, the use of cationic lipids can improve the loading of anionic antigens to the liposomes and upon injection promote a depot effect at the site of injection, promoting the codelivery of antigen and adjuvant to dendritic cells (e.g., [6, 7] ). However, this depot effect is more than electrostatically driven, with the choice of cationic lipids used in the formulation having an impact as explored in Chap. 10.",

These are similar in many ways to liposomes; however, non-ionic surfactants form the main component of their bilayers. The most common composition of niosomes investigated for vaccine delivery is 1-monopalmitoyl glycerol, cholesterol, and dicetyl phosphate. One might argue this is not a niosome formulation due to the inclusion of anionic dicetyl phosphate. However, the addition of charged surfactants has proven to enhance the stability of these vesicles and their inclusion in these vesicles is common practice. Generally, niosomes exhibit many similarities to liposomes; however, potential advantages cited include their lack of predisposition to oxidative degradation, as well potential lower cost of components and reduced variability compared to natural phospholipids. Whilst with current manufacturing methods, the cost and reproducibility of phospholipids is less of an issue, niosomes still offer a useful alternative to liposome formulations. In particular, niosomes appear an attractive option for oral delivery of vaccines due to their ability to withstand the harsh gastrointestinal environment as outlined in Chap. 11.",

ISCOMs are prepared from a mixture of phospholipid, cholesterol, and a saponin (often Quil A). Whilst a phospholipid/cholesterol mixture would normally form liposomes, the addition of appropriate concentrations of saponin to the mixture can result in restructuring of the system to form spherical, open, cage-like structures around 40 nm in size, as nicely shown in Chap. 12. Given that their structures are open, ISCOMs cannot incorporate hydrophilic antigens, and antigens need to display a degree of lipophilicity for inclusion into ISCOMs. If required, antigens can be modified through a range of methods to incorporate lipophilic regions within their structure, thereby promoting their incorporation into the structure. Alternatively, similar to cationic liposomes, cationic ISCOMs (where cationic components are used to build their structure) can electrostatically bind a range of anionic antigens and enhance their delivery. In Chap. 12 the formulation, preparation, and application of ISCOMs as vaccine adjuvants is considered.",

As with the other systems considered, immunostimulatory agents can be incorporated within these polymer constructs and thus these systems can act as delivery systems and adjuvants for antigens.

Furthermore, it can allow for the effective delivery of antigens to target cells of the immune system without the harsh conditions faced by orally delivered vaccines. The development of spray-drying methods outlined in Chap. 14 supports the ability of such powder vaccines to be delivered using conventional dry powder inhalers already clinically licensed for pulmonary delivery.",

            "text": "Therefore, by considering these vaccine delivery platforms in conjunction with the appropriate choices for antigen and adjuvant it is hoped that the threefold multicomponent nature of a vaccine can be considered more completely than before. When viewed conceptually, vaccines comprise an important triad. The first part of the vaccine, and in a sense the most important, is the biological component. This is the whole protein, or whole organism, or epitope-based part which confers the ability to be recognised by the immune system. It is this part which differentiates one vaccine from another, an anti-flu vaccine from an anti-TB vaccine. The second part of the vaccine is the adjuvant, which is one of many alternatives, that confers an immunogenicity to many vaccines that they would otherwise not possess. It often does this in a generic fashion, such as via agonising the innate immune system, so that the same adjuvant is quite capable of functioning in many different vaccine formulations. The final and third part of the vaccine is the delivery vehicle, as opposed to the delivery mechanism, such as oral vaccines versus injectable. The vehicle can be things as different as a viral vector or a liposome. An attenuated or heat-treated whole-organism vaccine can be thought of as combining all three parts of this triad in one supra-molecular moiety. Of course, this is a gross simplification, and many other things go into deployable vaccine formulations, such as preservatives, contaminants, and other chemical or biological components that so exercise the anti-vaccine lobby. Hopefully, this book will encourage us to think of vaccines in these terms, and provides the background necessary to engage with each of the three components of the vaccine triad.",
