The SARS outbreak was a timely reminder of the importance of education on virus infected communicable diseases. In Sept 2003, a one-year permanent exhibition\u2014Convergence of Art, Science and Technology (CAST) was open to the public in the Singapore Art Museum. At the Gallery #10, a 3D Protein Roller-coaster was designed by the first author and his students [1, 2] aiming to have an innovative, intuitive, and interesting way for the public to understand SARS-related viruses and their protein structures (Fig. 1.1a). The exhibition received good response. Based on the same concept, a Bio X-game was designed and exhibited in Oct 2005 at the China Science and Technology Museum in Beijing (Fig. 1.1b). In this game, the protein ribbon structure was modeled following the Chinese Great Wall. Players can learn molecular structures through riding on a virtual motorbike along the virtual Great Wall. In Dec 2005, Protein Rendition, the redesigned Bio X-game incorporating the protein sonification, was officially launched by Science Centre Singapore as part of the permanent Genome Exhibition [1, 3].\n",

They organized workshops in their campus as well as in other schools to promote the concept of Learning Life Science through VR Gaming (Fig. 1.2a). River Valley High (RVH) is another Singapore school pioneering the use of 3D for In-depth Learning. A VR classroom was set up in the school in Feb 2007 (Fig. 1.2b). Since then, the school has organized various learning activities with their 3D learning environment.

It is practically infeasible to show these two dynamic and real processes of cell division when students are comparing them. Simulation offers an alternative solution by providing realistic and dynamic processes to mimic the real situation. In-depth Learning uses 3D-enabled simulation technology to enhance learning.
