The major reservoir of MERS virus (MERS-CoV) responsible for infections in the human population is likely to be associated with dromedary camels (Cauchemez et al., 2014, Zumla et al., 2015, Sabir et al., 2015). Most individuals infected with MERS-CoV develop a severe respiratory illness accompanied by cough, fever, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. As of 28 July 2016, a total of 1791 laboratory-confirmed cases including 640 deaths in 27 countries have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization, 2015c). Although countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America have experienced sporadic importations of MERS from the Middle East, these have not generated local outbreaks thus far. The largest MERS outbreak outside Saudi Arabia occurred in the Republic of Korea as a result of a single importation from the Arabian Peninsula in May 2015. As of 4 July 2015, a total of 186 cases have been reported, including 38 deaths.",

            "text": "The potential for high variability in the number of secondary cases or superspreading events (SSEs) is a notable characteristic of infectious diseases (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005, Galvani and May 2005). Cases that generate a disproportionate number of secondary cases tend to occur during the early stage of an epidemic (Transmission Dynamics and Control of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2003, Goh et al., 2006). Conversely, unlike \u201csuperspreaders\u201d, the typical individuals tend to infect only a few or no cases at all. In recent works on the MERS outbreak (Chowell et al., 2015, Nishiura et al., 2015, Kucharski and Althaus, 2015, Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013), this individual variation has been described by transmission heterogeneity. Based on the stochastic approach, it is assumed that the number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual is negative binomial distributed with mean R0 and dispersion parameter k (with lower value representing higher heterogeneity, and vice versa). In this framework, SSEs during the recent MERS outbreaks can be explained by the high dispersion nature of the distribution of the number of secondary cases per case. For example, Chowell et al. (2015) estimated that the mean R0 for the MERS outbreaks was below the epidemic threshold value of 1 while the dispersion parameter k was estimated at 0.06, indicating high heterogeneity in the potential number of secondary cases. Simulations indicated that the probability of observing outbreaks larger than the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea is only of the order of 1%. However, this requires careful interpretation because SSEs during outbreaks might be treated as outliers rather than observations stemming from a highly over dispersed distribution. At the same time, infectious diseases with subcritical R0 and overdispersed k are more likely to subside within just a few disease generations.",

To the best of our knowledge, there is no dynamic compartmental model for the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea that incorporates the role of SSEs and the time-dependent parameters associated with the impact of early interventions. In this work, we develop a mathematical model that is consistent with consolidated retrospective investigations of previous MERS outbreaks.

We assumed a nosocomial infection in our model. The entire population stays at hospitals and consists of five epidemiological compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), isolated (J), and removed (R). Therefore, people who stay in a hospital and are not exposed to MERS are susceptible individuals, S, such as inpatients, outpatients, family members, healthcare workers, or visitors. The susceptible individuals, S, who have effective contacts with the infected individuals, I,\nJ, and the superspreaders, are exposed to MERS-CoV. Following the mean incubation period, 1/k, the exposed individuals, E, show symptoms and become infectious individuals, I. Note that, in this phase, people with illness might not be entirely under isolation before the case confirmation by laboratory means. After showing symptoms for a mean duration of 1/\u03b1 days, patients would be classified as laboratory-confirmed cases, J. Then, these individuals are immediately transferred to hospitals for MERS-CoV treatment and are isolated in an intensive care unit which is restricted to only healthcare staff with personal protective equipment (Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). The isolated individuals, J, are discharged from the hospital as cured or dead after 1/\u03b3 days on average. The transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV shown in Fig. 2 is then modeled by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations:(1)dSdt=\u2212\u03b2(t)S(I+lJ)/N\u2212\u2211i=1m\u03b2i*(H(t\u2212ti)\u2212H(t\u2212(ti+\u03b4ti)))S/N,dEdt=\u03b2(t)S(I+lJ)/N+\u2211i=1m\u03b2i*(H(t\u2212ti)\u2212H(t\u2212(ti+\u03b4ti)))S/N\u2212kE,dIdt=kE\u2212\u03b1(t)I,dJdt=\u03b1(t)I\u2212\u03b3J,dRdt=\u03b3J,where N is the total population, and H(t) is a heaviside function.",

The I class, who has common initial symptoms including fever, cough, and myalgia, would be misdiagnosed as having a common cold in the beginning of an outbreak for emerging infectious diseases such as the MERS epidemic in the Republic of Korea. Because the I class is likely to be isolated improperly, in the nosocomial setting, it can transmit the virus to the S class at transmission rate \u03b2. Although the J class is isolated to a negative-pressure room, a few of its members could transmit the virus, by accident, to other people such as healthcare workers. We assumed that they have less infectiousness with the reduction factor l. Hence, the force of infection by I and J is defined by\u03bb(t)=\u03b2(t)(I+lJ)/N.Since the superspreaders played a major role for the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea, we considered the force of infection by superspreaders separately in our model. The superspreaders have abnormally high transmissibility because of bad circumstances and personal health status, such as poor ventilation in a ward and excessive clinical symptoms including cough (Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015, Chowell et al., 2015, Stein, 2011). This transmission heterogeneity was deterministically incorporated with a heaviside function during a specific time interval, \u03b4ti, representing the exposed period of the i-th SSE beginning at time t\ni. The force of infection by the i-th superspreader is then given by\u03bbi*(t)=\u03b2i*(H(t\u2212ti)\u2212H(t\u2212(ti+\u03b4ti)))/N,where \u03b2i* is the individual transmission rate for the i-th superspreader. Note that the probability that a susceptible individual may have contact with a certain superspreader among the total population N is considered by 1N.",

Empirical evidence indicates that behavioral changes could make the nosocomial transmissibility decrease significantly (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004). Additionally, the government allowed the diagnostic testing for MERS to be performed at authorized health facilities in order to shorten the duration of diagnosis (Cho and Chu, 2015). The median value of duration from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation was significantly shortened after June 7 (from 6 days to 2 days).",

For example, the list of hospitals that were exposed to MERS patients was announced to the public on June 7. After that, people changed their behaviors such as avoiding visiting hospitals, wearing an N95 mask, and using hand sanitizers. At that time, the health authorities expanded the screening capacity for rapid diagnosis. These control measures could help detect suspected cases during their infectious period or even before the onset of symptoms. Such interventions could prevent the occurrence of SSEs because the potential superspreaders were immediately isolated after being confirmed with MERS infection.",

Moreover, the estimated Re after the control measures were implemented was substantially decreased. This indicates that the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea had a low transmissibility in the absence of the SSEs (Cowling et al., 2015). However, the reasons for the emergence of the biggest outbreak outside the Middle East are attributed to the importation of the virus without awareness of the public health (Nishiura et al., 2015), missed contacts (Cho and Chu, 2015), substantial exposure to infection (\u03b4t2) caused by delayed diagnosis and isolation (Park et al., 2015), and abnormally high contact rate of the superspreaders (\u03b2i*) in the crowded hospital setting (Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Of 186 confirmed cases with MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea, 153 cases (82.3%) were generated by only 5 cases (2.7%). Conversely, this transmission heterogeneity suggests that identifying them in their suspected stage of MERS-CoV infection could stem the subsequent transmission in over 150 cases in the host population (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005, Galvani and May 2005, Stein, 2011).",

Our results show that the intervention strategies in the early stage of the outbreak (\u03c4\u22647) could prevent the occurrence of SSEs and substantially reduce the outbreak duration and size. In other words, the failure of rapid detection and proper isolation of suspected patients early in the outbreak has contributed to SSEs, which is in line with the experience of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 (Galvani and May 2005, Goh et al., 2006, McDonald et al., 2004). Our results derived from the uncertainty analysis of the SSEs suggest that the recent MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea could have been smaller in size and duration. When \u03c4=11, it is very likely that outbreaks with both SSE 1 and SSE 2 have a shorter duration and a smaller size (with mean 58 days and 158 cases, respectively) compared to the baseline outcome.",

Case 14 and Case 16 were not classified as suspected cases but should have been home-quarantined as soon as they were exposed to MERS-CoV by the index case. Furthermore, the diagnostic delay in nosocomial infection made them become superspreaders. After the health authorities implemented the strong control measures such as contact tracing using CCTV surveillance and the GPS of mobile phones, the confirmed cases who were not identified in the contact tracing gradually decreased since June 12 (Cho and Chu, 2015). Our results suggest the importance of the early implementation of such interventions in the rapid containment of the SSEs and, consequently, in the remarkable reduction in outbreak duration and size.",
