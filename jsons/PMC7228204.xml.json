On the one hand, we must consider that in patients with erythrodermic psoriasis or severe psoriatic arthritis immunosuppressive treatments are essential; on the other hand, we must not overlook the immunosuppressive effect of these drugs, which can presently increase the risk of infectious complications and promote the spreading of COVID\u201019 infection. Although the rapid effect of these drugs is well demonstrated, it should be considered that the psoriatic patients on CsA/MTX/anti\u2010TNF\u2010\u0251 are partly immunodepressed with an increased risk of opportunistic infections and to date it is unknown whether there may be an increased risk of COVID\u201019 infection in these patients.
