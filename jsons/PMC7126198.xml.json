Proteases are, based on their nature of catalysis, classified into five major groups: serine proteases, cysteine proteases, aspartic proteases, metalloproteases, and proteases with an unknown mechanism (Barret et al., 1998). From these groups, the metalloproteases, with more than 30 families identified to date, are most diverse. In mammalian physiology, the high interest in metalloproteases originates from the fact that they are attractive targets for drug design.",

Two distinct forms of ACE are known: a somatic form (sACE), which is found in many tissues, and a smaller iso-enzyme, germinal ACE (gACE, also called testicular ACE [tACE]), which is found exclusively in testes, where it has a crucial role in fertility (Fig. 2\n). The soluble, circulating form of the sACE protein is produced by a \u201csecretase,\u201d probably a zinc-metalloprotease, which releases ACE from the membrane by cleaving off the extracellular part (Turner and Hooper, 2002).",

Knock-out mice all show reduced blood pressure, altered kidney morphology, impaired somatic growth, and male sterility (Esther 1996, Eriksson 2002). These mice produce normal numbers of sperm that are indistinguishable from wild-type sperm in assays of viability, motility, capacitation, and induction of the acrosome reaction. Absence of ACE, however, does cause defects in sperm transport in the oviducts and in binding to zonae pellucidae (Hagaman et al., 1998). Knockout of tACE, leaving the sACE intact, has proven that tACE expression is both necessary and sufficient for fulfilling the role of ACE in male fertility (Ramaraj et al., 1998). Recently, immunocytochemical studies have shown that tACE is completely shed from the sperm membrane before ejaculation. This would imply that the defects in sperm transport in the oviducts and in binding to zonae pellucidae after tACE knockout are not directly related with tACE activity (Metayer et al. 2002), so the exact role of tACE remains to be uncovered. The fact that to date no in vivo substrate has been found for tACE is the main bottleneck in tACE research.",

Almost 50 years after the discovery of ACE itself, two groups (Donoghue 2000, Tipnis 2000) introduced the first homolog of mammalian ACE. This protein and its homolog were named ACE2 and ACEH, respectively, and were shown to be an essential regulator of heart function (Crackower et al., 2002). Human ACE2 is an 805\u2013amino acid\u2013long type I integral membrane protein, including a 17\u2013amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and a putative C-terminal membrane anchor. The extracellular domain shares a 42% sequence identity with the catalytic domain of sACE. It is 33% identical to human testicular (germinal) ACE and also contains a single catalytic site. ACE2 contains six putative N-linked glycosylation sites on the extracellular part (Tipnis et al., 2000). The C-terminal domain of ACE2 shares a 48% sequence identity with collectrin (Vickers 2002, Zhang 2001), a developmentally regulated renal transmembrane glycoprotein. The many similarities in the genomic sequence of ACE2 and ACE indicate that there is an evolutionary relationship between these two genes (Turner and Hooper, 2002). ACE2 transcripts are detected in heart, lung, kidney, the gastrointestinal tract, and testis (Harmer 2002, Komatsu 2002). ACE2 is located at the endothelium of coronary and intrarenal vessels and in the renal tubular epithelium. Like ACE, ACE2 also appears to be susceptible to cleavage and secretion from the cell surface (Donoghue et al., 2000).",

            "text": "However, the sequence identity of the juxtamembrane regions of ACE and ACE2 is different. The cleavage site present in ACE (\u2013Ala-Arg Ser-Glu\u2013) is absent in ACE2. Hence, a different secretase may be involved in the shedding of ACE2. ACE2 does not have the same substrate specificity as ACE, nor is it inhibited by the typical ACE inhibitors such as enalapril, lisinopril, and captropril. ACE2 hydrolyzes AngI and AngII but cleaves neither bradykinin nor the typical ACE substrate Hip-His-Leu (Fig. 1). To hydrolyze AngI and AngII, ACE2 acts as a carboxypeptidase, removing one amino acid from the C terminus of the substrate. This is also the case for kinetensin, des-Arg9 bradykinin, and neurotensin (Donoghue 2000, Turner 2002). Several other regulatory peptides, including the enkephalins, are not substrates of ACE2. It seems that ACE2 prefers to cleave a single C-terminal hydrophobic residue from its substrates (Table I) and consequently does not hydrolyze bradykinin that contains an arginine at its C terminus. ACE2 is the first mammalian carboxypeptidase identified that contains the HExxH active site. ACE2 also acts on apelin-13 and apelin-36 peptides, of which the role is not yet fully understood but involves an effect on hypertension and vasoconstriction (Lee et al., 2000). Two opioid peptides, dynorphin A(1\u201313) and \u03b2-casamorphin, are also ACE2 substrates (Eriksson 2002, Vickers 2002). These peptides activate G protein-coupled opioid receptors that regulate pain perception and are suggested to negatively affect cardiomyocyte contractility (Pugsley 2002, Ventura 1992, Wenzlaff 1998).",

SARS is the abbreviation for the CoV-induced disease that causes SARS, with a mortality rate of approximately 10% (Ksiazek 2003, Kuiken 2003). The virus associates with cellular receptors to mediate infection of the target cells (Gallagher 2001, Holmes 2003). ACE2, acting as a cellular receptor, efficiently binds to the S1 domain of SARS-CoV, efficiently supporting the replication of SARS-CoV. Adding a soluble form of ACE2, but not that of ACE, blocks the association of SARS-CoV and its target cell. Replication of the virus in cells and the formation of syncitia can be blocked by antibodies against ACE2, which indicates the importance of ACE2 in the replication of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003).",

It seems that these differences occur in the ligand binding cavity, influencing the binding of the peptide carboxyterminus (Guy et al., 2003). The crystal structure of ACE2, native and inhibitor bound, revealed a large inhibitor-dependent bending movement of the two enzyme domains to one another, positioning important catalytic residues (Towler et al., 2004). It has been suggested that ridges surrounding the cavity at the top of the molecule serve as a binding region for SARS (Prabakaran et al., 2004). The discovery of this SARS-related function of ACE2, together with the knowledge of its structure, may contribute substantially to the possible treatment of SARS patients.",

To this day, no ACE peptidase activity has been detected in nematode tissues. However, there is one copy of an ACE-like gene (CD42D8.5) with a recorded expressed sequence tag (EST) present in the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Yet taking a closer look at this ACE-like gene reveals that the amino acids crucial for enzyme activity are absent. The sequence lacks all three zinc coordinating His residues, which means that the C. elegans ACE homolog does not have a functional zinc-binding domain. Therefore, it cannot be classified as a metallopeptidase homolog. Studies on this ACE-like nonmetallopeptidase, termed ACN-1, demonstrated that the protein plays an essential role in larval molting and adult morphogenesis. If ACN-1 is indeed evolutionarily related to the ancestral ACE, it means that during evolution it lost its peptidase activity but acquired sites for new molecular interactions that have a direct or indirect effect on the molting process in nematodes (Brooks et al., 2003). This phenomenon can be further expanded to other organisms and enzymes, as in the genome of D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, 15\u201325% of the protease-like genes lack one or more catalytic residues. Some of these proteins have probably lost the peptidase activity of their ancestor while acquiring new functions.",

In all vertebrate species examined, from humans at the top down to the electric fish Torpedo marmorata (Turner et al., 1987), the somatic ACE enzyme exists as the two-domain form. The analysis of the ACE gene of the housefly M. domestica revealed that this organism comprises a smaller form of the enzyme, indicating that this species does not contain the duplicated form of ACE. The existence of this single-domain isoform was confirmed when the Ance cDNA of D. melanogaster was sequenced (Cornell et al., 1995). All other invertebrate ACE enzymes that were discovered later on also consisted of the single-domain isoform. This leads to the view that invertebrate ACE represents the ancestral copy of the vertebrate two-domain enzyme and that the duplication event occurred before vertebrate radiation. However, this course of ACE evolution started to be questioned when the characterization of D. melanogaster ACE homologs began. The high level of homology between Ance and Acer points toward the existence of an ancestral ACE gene.",

Acer, however, has much less in common with this C domain. The active sites of the N domain of sACE and Acer share structural features that permit the binding of the RXP407 inhibitor, which does not bind the C domain of sACE. An analysis of the genomic region around the Ance gene in D. melanogaster has led to the identification of four additional ACE-like genes (Isaac et al., 2000). From these four, Ance 3, 4, and 5 seem to be transcribed, because ESTs were reported for these genes. With the information available today, no EST seems to be present for Ance 2. The predicted protein sequence corresponding the Ance 3 gene includes a C-terminal transmembrane anchor, as is seen in vertebrate ACE. Ance 2 codes for an ACE-like protein with a putative signal peptide, but without a C-terminal membrane region. Both genes lack crucial active site residues. These two gene predictions are interesting because alternative splicing of the predicted transcripts would lead to a two-domain, membrane- bound ACE-like product, as is seen in the vertebrate somatic form (Coates et al., 2000a). Taken together, this information indicates that the duplication event that gave rise to the vertebrate tandem protein predates the divergence of the Ecdysozoa and deuterostomes, and that the differing activities on the N and C domains have been maintained over a long period of time.",

However, there are no reports of insect homologs of these known in vivo substrates, and none of the many insect peptides isolated to date shows any structural resemblance to them. The search for angiotensin I\u2013like peptides in the brain of several insect species could not prove otherwise (Isaac 1998b, Schoofs 1998). In addition, a search in the D. melanogaster genome did not reveal any potential homologs of the precursor proteins of angiotensin I and bradykinin (Isaac et al., 2000). This is in contrast to the situation in leeches, where several reports on the presence of members of the renin\u2013angiotensin system have been published (Laurent 1996, Salzet 2001). Cleavage experiments with ACE from M. domestica showed that insect ACE exhibits a broad in vitro substrate specificity. The in vitro substrates of mammalian ACE, cholecystokinin, enkephalins, substance P, and LH-RH, are successfully cleaved by the endopeptidase activity of Musca ACE. This shows that insect ACE can hydrolyze C-terminally amidated peptides in vitro, functioning as an endopeptidase (Isaac 1997a, Lamango 1997). M. domestica ACE is unable to hydrolyze either CCAP (crustacean cardioactive peptide) or proctolin. Apparently, the penultimate C-terminal prolyl residue of proctolin makes this peptide resistant to ACE hydrolysis. The lack of hydrolysis of CCAP is likely a result of the presence of a disulfide bridge, which results in a secondary structure that prevents access to the active site.",

Many insect peptides are synthesized as inactive prohormones and need posttranslational processing to acquire their biological activity. In several prohormones, the sequence -Gly-Arg\u29f8Lys-Arg- is an internal consensus recognition sequence for endoproteolysis by prohomone convertases, generating peptide intermediates with a C-terminal \u2013Gly-Arg\u29f8Lys-Arg\u2013 extension. These are substrates for carboxypeptidase E (CPE) that sequentially removes the two basic amino acids from the C terminus, which is followed by amidation of the C terminus (Isaac et al., 1997b). The fact that insect ACE is capable of hydrolyzing these partially processed prohormone-like peptides, together with the intracellular colocalization of the enzyme with locustamyotropin peptides, implies a role for ACE in the biosynthesis of peptide hormones and neuropeptides (Schoofs et al., 1998).",

Furthermore, insect ACE preferentially acts as a dipeptidase and shows reduced tripeptidase activity. Of the insect peptides tested, locustatachykinin (Lom TK-1) proved to be the best substrate for Ance. However, the D. melanogaster tachykinins turned out to be poor Ance substrates (Siviter et al., 2002). Acer is not capable of cleaving angiotensin I (Houard et al., 1998), and most peptides tested were hardly degraded by Acer (Siviter et al., 2002).

Spermatogenesis proceeds normally in the mutants up to the spermatid stage, but these spermatids do not succeed in differentiating into spermatozoa. This change is accompanied by nuclear scattering and an abnormal morphology of the spermatids. Together with the observed expression pattern of Ance, the enzyme is believed to be required for spermatid differentiation through the processing of a regulatory peptide synthesized within the developing cyst (Hurst et al., 2003).",

However, if TMOF were to be inactivated by ACE, inhibition of ACE would lead to an increase of TMOF levels in the hemolymph, resulting in a reduced vitellogenin synthesis. Therefore, an activating effect of ACE on TMOF is postulated (Vandingenen et al., 2001). The discovery of ACE interactive peptides in the ovaries of the fleshfly (Vandingenen et al., 2002a), and the discovery that these peptide substrates originate from yolk gene products, strengthen the idea that ACE is a regulator of vitellogenic and developmental processes (Hens 2002, Vandingenen 2002b).",

Along with the cloning of the first D. melanogaster ACE homolog (Race, Ance), the gene coding for this protein was shown to be a target of the homeobox regulatory gene zerknullt (zen) and decapentaplegic (dpp) (Tatei et al., 1995). A 533-bp-long enhancer located in the Ance promotor region covers three zen protein binding sites and was shown to mediate selective expression in the amnioserosa. During early development, Ance is activated by zen and becomes associated with the differentiating amnioserosa and with the anterior and posterior midgut, where it persists throughout embryogenesis. In late embryos, Ance expression is detected in epithelial cells of the midgut and in the pericardial cells of the heart.

The characterization of ACN-1 in the nematode C. elegans shows that it is not necessarily the proteolytic function of ACE that is involved in developmental processes. The hypodermal expression of acn-1 is under the control of nuclear hormone receptors that regulate molting in C. elegans. Functional acn-1 knockout by RNAi causes morphological defects in larvae and adults. More specifically, ACN-1 was found to be required for larval molting, male tail development, and formation of adult alae (Brooks et al., 2003).",

The localization of ACE in the neuropil indicates the metabolic inactivation of peptidic neurotransmitters. The presence of peptides from the adipokinetic hormone (AKH), kinin, and locustatachykinin family in the central nervous system (CNS), as well as the knowledge that these peptides are hydrolyzed by ACE (Lamango et al., 1997), indicates that they might be potential in vivo substrates for insect neuronal ACE. In neurosecretory cells, ACE is likely to be involved in the conversion of prohormones to active peptide hormones that are secreted into the hemolymph by the corpora cardiaca or corpora allata (Isaac et al., 1998b). Because insect ACE has been shown to exert in vitro prohormone processing activities against the locustamyotropins, and locustamyotropin-containing cells of the locust brain and suboesophageal ganglion also contain ACE, this insect enzyme most probably plays a role in the biosynthesis of these hormones (Veelaert et al., 1999).",

Supportive data concerning this hypothesis came from expression studies in larvae from the sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina and the old screwworm Chrysomya bezziana, which are known to secrete or excrete chymotrypsins and trypsins in larval cultures and wound sites. The knowledge that an ACE homolog is also secreted or excreted from these larvae indicated a dual role in wound formation.

The presence of ACE in this venom, together with the presence of antibacterial activity, implies that ACE could be one of the enzymes involved in the processing of antibacterial peptides from the venom sac (Dani et al., 2003). All the mentioned data indeed point toward an involvement of ACE in the defense system, but they are still only hypothetical. The first physiological evidence for the existence of a connection between ACE and defense came from studies in the locust L. migratoria. Locusts that are subjected to an immune challenge through injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the hemocoel showed an increase in ACE mRNA-expression. Comparing the level of ACE transcription from LPS-treated animals with control animals revealed an approximately 10-fold increase in ACE transcription 6 hours after the LPS-injection (Macours et al., 2003b). The exact nature of the ACE-defense connection remains to be clarified.",

            "text": "In mammals, all blood cells derive from hematopoietic stem cells that differentiate into different lineages. The involvement of ACE here resides in the inactivation of Ac-SDKP (N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline), a peptide that prevents the recruitment of hematopoietic stem cells (Azizi 1996, Baudin 2002). Insects also continue to produce hemocytes via a division of stem cells or by continued division of hemocytes in circulation (Jones 1970, Ratcliffe 1985). On the basis of this information, a possible connection between ACE and the immune system can be suggested in the replenishment of the hemocytes that are involved in the insect immune response. The possibility of ACE being involved in the processing of antimicrobial peptides in locust hemolymph cannot be excluded, but so far, except for lysozyme and coagulogen, no major antibacterial activity could be detected in locust hemolymph (Van Sambeek and Weisner, 1999). The rise in ACE expression that follows LPS injection is not likely to result from an involvement of ACE in the prophenoloxidase cascade, as this pathway is not activated by injection of LPS. However, the immune system of the locust responds to LPS injection through the formation of nodules (Goldsworthy 2002, Hoffman 1974). Therefore ACE may be required in the process of nodule formation. This speculation is in agreement with the recent findings of Goldsworthy and colleagues (2003), who investigated the effect of LPS on the prophenoloxidase cascade and nodule formation in the locust. Activation of prophenoloxidase by LPS could only be achieved by coinjection with AKH, not by the injection of LPS alone. When captopril was coinjected, the activation of the PPO cascade remained unaffected (with\u29f8without AKH). However, captopril did inhibit the nodule formation induced by LPS (Goldsworthy et al., 2003). Considering these data, a possible role for ACE in the immune system of insects may reside in the regulation of nodulation.",

The full sequencing of such AII-like peptide was realized in another leech species, namely Erpobdella octoculata (Salzet et al., 1995). This leech AII peptide differs from the vertebrate AII by a c-terminal amidation. Injection of this AII into the leech results in a decrease in mass, reflicting a diuretic effect. Also in T. tessulatum, a renin-like peptide was isolated (Laurent and Salzet, 1995a) and partial peptidic sequences were identified.

Ten cysteine residues in the ECE sequence are conserved among the other members of the family and are probably involved in disulfide bridges. The ECE protein has 10 predicted sites for N glycosylation in the extracellular domain. This is consistent with the observation that ECE is a highly glycosylated protein and explains the difference between the predicted molecular mass and the mass shown on SDS-PAGE. Purification and cloning studies of rat ECE-1 have shown that it consists as a disulphide-linked dimer, in which Cys412 is solely responsible for the formation of the intermolecular disulphide bond (Shimada et al., 1996). The large extracellular domain contains the zinc-binding consensus sequence HEXXH, in which the glutamic acid (E) is the most important residue for catalytic activity. The two flanking histidine (H) residues act as zinc coordinating amino acids. The third ligand for the zinc atom is E651, whereas H716 is involved in the stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate during the transition state (Shimada et al., 1995). Four ECE-1 isoforms have been identified in humans and were named ECE-1a (758 amino acids), ECE-1b (770 amino acids), ECE-1c (754 amino acids) and ECE-1d (767 amino acids) (Jafri 2003, Valdenaire 1995, Valdenaire 1999a). The four isoforms are transcribed from a single gene and result from the use of alternate promoters located upstream of specific exons. They only differ in the first half (approximately) of their cytoplasmatic tail and are identical over their remaining sequence, including the enzymatic catalytic site. As a logical consequence, the isoforms display comparable converting activity.",

Within 1 year of its discovery, two structurally related peptides were identified and termed ET-2 and ET-3, respectively.

ET-2 exhibits the closest structural similarity to ET-1, differing by only three amino acid residues, whereas ET-3 differs by six amino acids. ET isoforms are widely distributed among various cells and tissues. Of the three isoforms, the most widely distributed, best studied, and most potent is ET-1.

            "text": "ETs are produced by a variety of organ and body tissues such as the lung and kidney as well as the brain, pituitary, peripheral endocrine tissues, and placenta. Most abundantly, endothelial cells of the vascular endothelium produce ET. ET binds to two types of receptors (ETA and ETB) (Arai 1990, Sakurai 1990). Both contain seven transmembrane domains and activate an overlapping set of G proteins, producing an array of different physiological responses (Douglas and Ohlstein, 1997). Although structurally highly similar, these receptors possess different affinities for the three isoforms of ET. Like many other regulatory peptides, the ETs are maturated through proteolytic processing from larger precursor polypeptides, termed \u201cprepro-ETs.\u201d This proteolytic cleavage generates an essentially inactive intermediate referred to as big ET. The subsequent hydrolysis of big ET into the final active product ET, and a presumed inactive C-terminal fragment, is catalyzed by ECE (Fig. 3a). In the case of big ET-1 and ET-2, proteolysis occurs at the Trp21-Val22 bond. ET-3 is formed through cleavage of the Trp21-Ile22 bond of big ET-3 (Inoue et al., 1989) (Fig. 3b). The conversion of big ET to ET can occur in the extracellular medium and in the secretory pathway; cells thus secrete big ETs either alone or together with endothelins (Parnot et al., 1997). The physiological importance of the cleavage of big ET is indicated by a 140-fold increase in vasoconstrictor potency on cleavage to ET. This makes ECE an important activating protease in the biosynthetic pathway of ET. ECE-1 null mice exhibit a phenotype similar to that of ET-1- or ETA-deficient mice, demonstrating the significance of ECE-1 in generating bio-available ET-1 (Yanagisawa et al., 1998).",

Kidney-ET regulates water and sodium excretion and acid\u2013base balance, and it participates in the pathophysiology of acute and chronic renal failure. In the brain, the ET system modulates cardiorespiratory centers and hormone release (Kedzierski and Yanagisawa, 2001).

The main structural features of ECE-1 are conserved in ECE-2 (Emoto and Yanagisawa 1995). Both are type II integral membrane proteins with the HEXXH consensus sequence. The 10 cysteine residues conserved between ECE-1, NEP, and Kell, are also conserved in ECE-2, as is the cysteine residue responsible for dimerization of ECE-1. ECE-2 is also heavily glycosylated, with 10 possible glycosylation signals. Although ECE-2 shows specific activity to produce mature ET-1 from big ET-1, like ECE-1, the striking difference between ECE-2 and ECE-1 is the acidic pH optimum of 5.5 of ECE-2, in contrast to the neutral pH optimum of ECE-1. This indicates that ECE-2 is involved in ET synthesis in the intracellular compartments in which the pH is acidic (Emoto and Yanagisawa, 1995). ECE-2 has been reported to be expressed in various organs and tissues including cultured human vascular endothelial cells, uterus, ovary, heart, lung, and liver, indicating various functions for the enzyme.",

            "text": "NEP is primarily expressed in the kidney, where it has the capacity to cleave and inactivate the natriuretic and vasodilatory peptide (ANP), which controls arterial pressure (Beaulieu et al., 1999). The first physiological function of NEP was found in the brain, where NEP is located in neuronal cells. There, it controls the half-life of enkephalins and substance P (two neuropeptides involved in pain control) through inactivation (Malfroy et al., 1978). NEP also plays a pivotal role in various cancers, such as prostate cancer and leukemia (Letarte 1988, Papandreou 1998). A variety of other physiological substrates has subsequently been revealed for NEP (Turner and Tanzawa, 1997), although most attention has been focused on the vasodilator ANP. The development of selective NEP inhibitors, of which the best studied are thiorphan and phosphoramidon, has primarily been driven by their potential as novel cardiovascular agents (Roques and Beaumont, 1993). The medicinal treatment of various afflictions with NEP inhibitors has become so prevalent that they now constitute a class of drugs used in both gastroenterology and cardiology (Tanja et al., 2000). There is, however, a potential downside to the clinical use of NEP inhibitors, as downregulation of NEP levels is seen in various cancers and in the lung, where it potentiates neurogenic inflammatory responses. Recent reports that a NEP-like enzyme can degrade the neurotoxic \u03b2-amyloid peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease raises new concern about chronic blockade of NEP-like activity in the CNS (Carson and Turner, 2002).",

A second reason for not subscribing this activity to a typical NEP enzyme comes from the fact that NEP is known to rapidly degrade mature ET-1 at multiple cleavage sites (Vijayaraghavan et al., 1990). Also, the use of a fluorescent substrate highly selective for ECE (Luciani et al., 2001) confirmed the presence of ECE-activity in the locust. This ECE-like activity was found to be very abundant in the reproductive system (ovaries and testes) of the locust, indicating a role in reproduction and development.

Among these glycosylation signals, Asn 589 and Asn 608, which are known to be important for the bioactivity of mammalian ECE-1 are conserved (Nelboeck et al., 1998).",

The C-terminal CEVW sequence, critical for proper enzyme maturation and activity (MacLeod et al., 2001), is present in LomECE, as is the endothelin-binding site NAYY (Fig. 4). The cysteine residue responsible for dimerization of the protein in mammalian organisms (Shimada et al., 1996) is absent in LomECE, supporting the hypothesis that early divergent forms of this enzyme may have existed in monomeric form (Zhang et al., 2001). The need for a dimeric form of ECE for enzyme functionality was refuted by studies with solubilized recombinant ECE-1 in which dimerization did not appear to be essential or preferential for full ECE activity (Korth et al., 1997). Studies with a monomeric and dimeric from of bovine ECE demonstrated that these two forms posses a comparable biochemical profile. The major difference between the two forms is that the dimeric form is found to be more efficient in catalyzing the conversion of big ET-1 into ET-1 (Kulathila et al., 2002), sustaining the possibility of other in vivo substrates for the invertebrate ECE form. The fact that ECE mRNA is found in a variety of tissues in the locust is indicative of a major, and most probably diversified, biological role for the enzyme.",

The Porphyromonas gingivalis pepO sequence (PgPepO) shows 31% sequence identity with human ECE-1 and 29.9% with human NEP.

This indicates that PepO gene is at least involved in the first step of the bacterial cycle; namely, the invasion and lysis of the mammalian cell membrane (Ansai et al., 2003). In the MEROPS database for peptidases (Rawlings et al., 2002), a large number of bacteria can be found that all contain at least one M13 homolog in their genome. Also in Archeae, M13 homolog are reported, but the majority of the Archeae do not contain an M13 homolog in their genome. The presence of homolog of these enzymes in prokaryotes could perhaps have resulted from a horizontal exchange of genes between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Froeliger et al., 1999). However, because members of the M13 family are present in Eubacteria and some Archeabacteria, as well as in eukaryotes, the possibility that an ultimate ancestor of the M13 family may have been present in the organism that preceded both modern bacteria and eukaryotes cannot be excluded. Although the exact evolutionary relationship between eukaryotic and prokaryotic metalloproteases cannot yet be determined, the high level of sequence conservation indicates that these enzymes are under strong evolutionary constraints, thereby protecting structural features essential for enzyme activity.",

The formation of the A\u03b2 peptides occurs through the initial cleavage by a \u03b2 secretase, followed by the action of a \u03b3 secretase (Fig. 5\n). The pathological accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brain (formation of plaques) is the primary cause of neuronal cell death and dementia in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Hardy and Higgins, 1992). The degree of A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain is dependent not only on its production but also on its removal. The three zinc-metalloproteases NEP, ECE, and possibly ACE have been put forward as A\u03b2 degrading enzymes, thus limiting the amount of A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain.",

In addition, it inhibits A\u03b2 fibril formation and A\u03b2-induced cytotoxicity (Hu et al., 2001). The catabolism of A\u03b2 by ACE occurs through a rather unusual cleavage, between the Asp7\u2013Ser8 bond of A\u03b2. However, infusion of ACE inhibitors in the brain of A\u03b2PP transgenic mice had no effect on the level of A\u03b2 present in the brain. This raises some questions concerning the significance of ACE in the A\u03b2 catabolism in vivo. This is in contrast to the M13 metalloproteases, NEP and ECE, for which the in vivo involvement has been confirmed.",

In NEP-deficient mice, increased levels of A\u03b2 are detected (Iwata et al., 2001) because of a reduction in the level of exogenous A\u03b2 catabolism. In addition, areas in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's that are enriched in plaques display reduced levels of NEP (Yasojima 2001a, Yasojima 2001b). All this indicates that NEP and ECE are rate-limiting peptidases participating in A\u03b2 catabolism (Fig. 5).

The first reason was that it was not logical to start searching for peptidic regulators of blood pressure in animals with an open circulatory system. Second, many invertebrates are small, and harvesting enough tissue for the purification of enzymes is difficult and time consuming. Molecular studies in invertebrates have expanded rapidly with the development of microtechniques that make it much easier to work with these small quantities. Many of the identified invertebrate genes are also known to be in vertebrate species, where they posses similar characteristics and functions. These observations support the fact that invertebrates provide excellent model systems for the study of genetics. By comparing the human genome with those of other organisms, regions of similarity and divergence can be identified, thereby providing critical clues about the structure and function of human genes. This information may be beneficial for developing better strategies for treating and preventing some human diseases. With each molecule that is sequenced, this approach becomes more powerful.",

However, the large in vitro substrate specificity and the recent discovery of their involvement in Alzheimer's disease asks for caution in the use of ACE and ECE inhibitors as therapeutic drugs. The large cellular and tissue distribution of ACE and ECE in the human body also points toward the possibility of as-yet-unknown physiological roles of these enzymes. The idea that invertebrate counterparts of these enzymes function as regulators of blood pressure is very unlikely. Hence, these organisms can be useful in the clarification of these extra enzymatic functions. Future research concerning the roles of these enzymes will have to involve the identification of new substrates and inhibitors. Possible substrates can be tested on their in vivo characteristics by colocalization studies and knockout experiments.",
