For instance, analysis of the 2016 Ebola outbreak points to the importance of open data, including genomic data to generate learnings about diseases where effective vaccines are lacking or have not been developed. The report also points to the role of national response centres as critical arbiters of data access during emergencies [3]. Similarly, open data played a major role in the response to the 2016 Zika outbreak with a commitment from leading national agencies and science organisations to share data [4, 5].",

National infrastructures also provide the bulk of data processing capabilities for the many COVID-19 research projects now underway. ELIXIR Nodes are involved in\u2014and in several cases coordinate\u2014these national genomic and phenotypic data stores. The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) is a resource for the secure archival and access to all types of potentially identifiable genetic and phenotypic data resulting from biomedical research projects [11]. The EGA is currently transitioning from a centralised model to becoming a federated resource with data deposition and access nodes across Europe. This federated model provides the coordination across Europe to ensure consistent discovery and access to relevant human genetic datasets for research. As much of the COVID-19 host data will come directly from clinical care it will likely be subject to national laws and regulations and therefore, for example, much of the data is unlikely to be consented to leave national jurisdictions. As part of the COVID-19 response ELIXIR will accelerate implementation of the Federated European Genome-phenome Archive (FEGA) to provide the necessary infrastructure and coordination between European national initiatives and ensure rapid sharing of COVID-19 host data in full compliance with national regulations (e.g. GDPR). In addition, the rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic provides a blueprint for European data access in projects such as 1 Million European Genomes [12].",
