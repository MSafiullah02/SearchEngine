            "text": "Initially, the CD designation was intended to describe a cluster of mAbs that display the same cellular reactivity and identify the same molecular species. For instance, CD2 mAbs are reagents that react with a 50\u2010kDa transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on resting T cells. Later, the CD designations were used to describe the recognized molecules, but had to be clarified by attaching the term antigen or molecule to the designation (e.g., CD2 molecule; Knapp et al., 1989). Currently, CD2 is generally used to designate the molecule; CD2 antibody is used to designate the antibody.",

            "text": "In Table 1 the main characteristics of all human mAb groups (clusters) and leukocyte surface molecules to which CD designations have been assigned in the international workshops are summarized (see also appendix\nima04b, which lists mAbs to mouse cell\u2010surface antigens). Although extensive, this table can provide only selected information. In particular, it was sometimes difficult to select exemplary mAbs to list. For some CD clusters, only a few mAbs are yet characterized, but in others the number of antibodies assigned in the Workshops is considerable. In addition, remarks concerning the molecular and/or functional characteristics of CD molecules and CD mAbs are brief. For further details the reader is referred to the extensive and well\u2010documented proceedings of the individual Workshops (Bernard et al., 1984; Reinherz et al., 1986; McMichael et al., 1987; Knapp et al., 1989; Schlossman et al., 1995; Kishimoto et al., 1997; Mason et al., 2002). Protein Reviews on the Web (PROW) is a database established by Stephen Shaw accessible at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PROW/, which provides authoritative peer\u2010reviewed summaries and links to genome and protein databases. Finally, for portable convenience, a similar compilation is available for personal digital assistant (Nicholson et al., 2002).",
