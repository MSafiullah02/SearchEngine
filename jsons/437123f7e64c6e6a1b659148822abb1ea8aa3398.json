Human bocavirus detection was strongly associated with CAP (aOR = 9.1; 95% CI = 1.6-103) ( Figure 2 ). Three of these infections (23%) were codetections with other putative viral pathogens, and monodetection of HBoV was significantly associated with CAP (OR = 7.3; 95% CI = 1.6-35). Human bocavirus was not targeted as part of the EPIC study protocol due to uncertainty over its role as a human pathogen [37, 38] . Human bocavirus is a Parvovirus with a DNA genome and can be detected for weeks to months following acute infections, which makes it difficult to demonstrate its pathogenicity even in well-designed epidemiologic studies. Pan-viral group PCR detected HBoV DNA in 12 of 70 patients (17.1%) and 2 of 90 asymptomatic control subjects (2.2%). RNA sequencing identified HBoV mRNA in 10 of 70 patients (14.3%) and 0 of 90 asymptomatic control subjects (aOR = 31.4; 95% CI = 1.8-546; P < .05). Sequencing reads spanning splice sites of the viral capsid mRNA [39] confirmed that mRNA rather than genomic DNA served as the sequencing template (data not shown). This strong association is in contrast with numerous PCR-based studies targeting viral genomic DNA [37, 40] , suggesting that detection of HBoV mRNA may serve as a marker for acute (ie, clinically relevant) infections. Although these results will need to be confirmed in larger studies, our results suggest that HBoV may be associated with CAP and may be a true pathogen.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 526, "end": 530, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 531, "end": 534, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1091, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1291, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1295, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 221, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Human herpesviruses that can cause respiratory tract infections including pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts (eg, HSV, CMV, parvovirus B19, HHV6) were more frequently detected in patients than control subjects in our analysis. However, children with severely immune-compromising conditions were excluded from the EPIC study. These viruses were more frequently detected by PVG PCR (targeting viral genomic DNA) than by RNA-seq. In the absence of detectable RNA, active replication is unlikely, and their detection may be a result of reactivation or latent infection rather than acute infection. Lastly, we detected a number of viruses not known to cause respiratory tract infections, including EBV, anelloviruses, HHV7, polyomaviruses, and papillomavirus. Their detection in the nasopharynx and/or oropharynx of asymptomatic children as well as CAP patients (in validation and test-negative groups) is consistent with previous reports [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Their detection demonstrates both the power of comprehensive pathogen detection but also the importance of using appropriate controls. Interestingly, detection rates for these DNA viruses were much higher by DNA-based PVG PCR than by RNA-seq. It is possible that RNA-based testing may be more sensitive for DNA viruses during high-level replication when mRNA is abundant. Although both RNA-seq and PVG PCR provide broadrange detection of respiratory viruses, each method has potential advantages and disadvantages. RNA sequencing is highly unbiased, demonstrated by the detection of divergent enteroviruses not identified by PVG PCR, and enables identification of nonviral pathogens, as exemplified by detection of M. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis. In contrast, PVG PCR identified DNA viruses that were not detected by RNA-seq. This may have been due in part to shedding predominantly of viral particles (containing genomic DNA) with low levels of active replication (ie, production of mRNA) in the upper respiratory tract. Performing next-generation sequencing with both RNA-seq and DNA sequencing might increase the yield for DNA viruses and bacteria but at increased financial cost.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 936, "end": 940, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 941, "end": 945, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 946, "end": 950, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 956, "end": 960, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 961, "end": 965, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 966, "end": 970, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "As hypothesized, broad-range pathogen detection enabled identification of viruses not part of comprehensive test panels (eg, HBoV, Coxsackievirus, HPIV-4, Echovirus, human parechovirus), genetically divergent strains escaping PCR-based detection (as can be seen with genetically diverse viruses; eg, HRV-A, HRV-C), and unrecognized bacterial infections (eg, C. trachomatis) [15] . In addition to the sequence data analysis described above, we also performed de novo assembly of RNA-seq results and searched resulting contiguous sequences for conserved protein profiles [48] on all data from children with CAP without identifying additional putative pathogens (data not shown). Despite these extensive efforts, a potential pathogen was still not detected in 46 children (65.7%) with CAP of unknown etiology. This could have been due to testing of NP/OP swabs and not lower respiratory tract samples, which are preferred for detection of bacterial and fungal pathogens; focus on viral pathogens; inadequate timing of sample collection; polymicrobial infections caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens; or noninfectious mimics. Use of broadrange methods may provide even greater benefits in the 60% of adults with CAP in whom no pathogen is detected using conventional approaches [35] . Our findings also highlight the limits of etiologic diagnosis of CAP with noninvasive samples. We cannot exclude that highly diverse viruses without homology to known human viral pathogens may have caused CAP in some of the children. Further advancing the diagnosis of CAP is likely to require additional sampling as well as hostbased markers of infectious processes that may help confirm infectious etiologies even when a pathogen cannot be directly detected [49] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 378, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 569, "end": 573, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1281, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1744, "end": 1748, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.
