Additionally, the use of the COAST scorecard was reviewed with each family via a printed diary form before discharge from the birth hospitalization and at each visit. Families were reminded to begin filling out the scorecard and to notify the study team when their child developed respiratory symptoms resulting in a score of \u22653 and to continue completing the scorecard daily until 10 days had elapsed or the child's symptoms dropped below a score of 3.18, 19, 20 The scorecard assigns points to the presence or absence of fever \u2265100\u00b0F, hoarseness, wheezing, retractions, tachypnea, cyanosis, apnea, being ill for >4 days, and the degree of cough and rhinorrhea. Maximal possible score is 31 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The PRISM study sought to identify all respiratory infections with the full range of severity so a threshold score of 3 was chosen as a sensitive measure of illness. When parents reported a COAST score of \u22653, a study visit was completed and respiratory samples obtained. Staff followed up with families to ensure scorecard completion and also reviewed the 3 days before when a score of 3 was reached, so that the full range of illness was recorded. For participants with baseline respiratory symptoms such as retractions or wheezing, the families were instructed to assign points only when findings were greater than baseline.",

With day 1 of reporting (score of \u22653) having the most abundant diary data, a factor analysis with polychoric correlation matrix of symptoms reported on day 1 was used to determine the symptom weights for cough, tachypnea, fever, hoarseness, retractions, rhinorrhea, sick for >4 days, and the presence of wheeze as reported on the scorecard. Cyanosis and apnea were rare, so were not considered. A value of 10 was added to each weighted score to produce all positive values. The first factor explained the largest amount of the variance in the data (51.2%) and was used to assign weights to the variables in the new Infant Research Respiratory Infection Severity Score (IRRISS). LMER models were again used to validate the IRRISS with the detection of a viral respiratory pathogen as well as hospitalization as measures of disease severity. Finally, severity scores were calculated similarly but separately for the term and preterm subjects to explore potential heterogeneity among age cohorts, and the performance of each score was compared with the IRRISS and COAST score.",
