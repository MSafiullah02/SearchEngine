P falciparum can cause severe disease, manifest not only by episodic fever and diaphoreses but also by severe anemia, central nervous system disturbance, renal failure with massive hemoglobinuria (\u201cblack water fever\u201d), and fatal shock syndrome. Malarial infections result in an enormous disease burden, with an annual incidence of 300 to 500 million cases worldwide; it is a major cause of infant death in endemic regions. The anopheles mosquito is the vector for most transmissions, but in the United States, the receipt of blood from an infected but asymptomatic donor from a malaria-endemic area is a more common route than is a direct mosquito bite.",

Malarial spread by transfusion is also fostered by the relatively long asymptomatic parasitemia for each of the four major malarial species. However, despite this constellation of circumstances, relatively few transfusion-transmitted cases occur. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports 103 transfusion-associated cases in the United States in the four decades from 1958 to 1998, averaging two to three cases per year or one case per 4 million units transfused.1 These numbers may underestimate true infections because some remain undetected and others remain unreported. Transfusion-transmitted malaria remains a risk because latent infection with P falciparum can persist on average for 1 to 2 years and considerably longer periods have been described.1 Infection with P vivax and P ovale can persist as long as 5 to 7 years, and P malariae for a lifetime. Malaria is also a blood-transmitted risk because the organism can survive at least a week at 4\u00b0C and can survive frozen red cell storage.",

Both antibody and nucleic acid detection strategies are feasible and under development, but they would have a very high cost-benefit ratio, and the former might have low specificity and sensitivity. Presently, blood banks depend on donor screening questions to exclude persons at risk because of lifelong or temporary residence in endemic areas. Donors are deferred on the following bases: (1) permanent residents of non-endemic countries who travel to an endemic area (as defined by CDC) are deferred for 1 year from the time that they leave the endemic area whether or not they have received anti-malarial prophylaxis, provided that they have been free of symptoms suggestive of malaria; (2) immigrants, refugees, and citizens or other residents of endemic countries are deferred for 3 years from the time they departed the endemic area provided that they have been free of symptoms to suggest malarial infection; (3) persons with a history of malaria are deferred for 3 years after symptoms are no longer present. These deferral periods are based on CDC data indicating that 97% of malaria cases in travelers occur within 1 year of leaving the risk area and that 99% of cases in permanent residents of endemic areas occur within 3 years of leaving the endemic area.1 While these deferrals have been effective in limiting transfusion-transmitted malaria, they come at the cost of many unnecessary donor deferrals in an age where travel to endemic areas is quite common. A specific and sensitive assay to detect parasitemia would be sparing of donors, though at a high cost relative to benefit.",

B divergens also has been identified in some US states, but the tick vector has not been identified. The human is always an accidental host, acquiring infection through a tick-bite, which frequently goes unnoticed, as Ixodes ticks are very small.

Data on the prevalence of Babesia infection in US blood donors from areas of high endemicity are reasonably sound. In the northeast United States, the seroprevalence of B microti reportedly ranges from 0.3% in the general population of Connecticut to 9.5% in patients with Lyme disease. Several reports of B microti in blood donors have been published, with rates as high as 4.3% (five of 115 positive) on Shelter Island, NY. A recent Connecticut study reported that 30 of 3,490 (0.9%) blood donors were seropositive for B microti. Perhaps more important, 10 of 19 (53%) seropositive donors from this study were demonstrably parasitemic when tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indicating an obvious transmission risk.2 A relatively recent finding is that parasitemia may be quite prolonged (as much as 6 months or more), even among asymptomatic individuals. The estimated risk of transfusion-transmission is as high as one in every 1,800 transfused units in highly endemic areas of Connecticut.2 Interestingly, some transmission has occurred from platelet components, which presumably contained contaminating red cells.",

Manifestations range from asymptomatic infection to a fulminant, malaria-like infection that rarely may be fatal. Symptoms are generally flu-like and may include malaise, chills, myalgia, anemia, fatigue, and fever (which can approach 40\u00b0C). Some patients also have nausea, emesis, night sweats, weight loss, and hematuria, which are believed to be associated with high levels of parasitemia. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may also be present. The parasites primarily infect erythrocytes. In most cases, infection and disease are acute, but as pointed out above, there may be some degree of chronicity. Immunocompromised, aged, and asplenic patients are at particular risk of developing serious, even fatal, disease as a result of transfusion transmission of the agent. While usually self-limiting, more severe cases are treatable with clindamycin and quinine; more recently, a combination of atovaquone and clindamycin has been shown to be effective, with fewer side effects.3\n",

The parasite is transmitted by reduvid or triatomine bugs. The parasite multiplies to high levels in the gut of the bug and bug feces, shed during feeding, are heavily contaminated. Infection (at least in humans) usually results from rubbing the insect\u2019s feces into the site of the bite or into mucus membranes. Congenital infection may also occur from an infected mother. Recently, oral transmission of T cruzi has been documented. In areas that are not endemic for T cruzi, blood transfusion may be the predominant route of human infection.

However, conditions favoring natural transmission to humans are generally confined to parts of Latin America, because of the high prevalence of infection among feral and domestic animals and the vector insect\u2019s tendency to live in cracks and fissures and roofs of substandard housing. Seroprevalence rates vary widely but may be as high as 60% in parts of Bolivia.6 An estimated 19 million infected individuals live in South and Central America and parts of Mexico. In many South American countries, significant efforts to reduce the risk of disease, usually by aggressive use of insecticides inside homes, are underway. In the United States, although rare autochthonous infections have occurred, the majority of human infections follow from immigration of individuals infected elsewhere. At one time, an estimated 100,000 legal immigrants were infected; that number may be much higher now. Seroprevalence studies have indicated that about 1 in 7,500 to 1 in 9,000 blood donors may be seropositive in areas with large numbers of migrants, such as Los Angeles or Miami,7 but the overall US prevalence may be lower, 1:25,000 to 1:50,000.

However, many other mammals and some other vertebrates can be infected. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes (largely culicines) and man is an accidental host. Until 1999, the virus was confined to Africa, Southern Europe, and parts of the Middle East and India, but it appeared in the United States for the first time that year, when 62 human cases were reported in Queens, NY. Over the next 5 to 6 years, the virus spread throughout the United States and into Canada, Mexico, and some of the Caribbean. To date, peak years of the epidemic have been 2002 and 2003, with 4,156 and 9,862 reported human cases, respectively, but there are estimates that several hundred thousand individuals were infected in each of those years. Fewer cases were seen in the 2 subsequent years. The risk of transfusion transmission was estimated as high as one per thousand units in areas and times of peak incidence.8 Some 23 documented cases of transmission by transfusion occurred in 20029 and, as a result, nucleic acid testing (NAT) for WNV RNA was implemented by July 2003.

In addition, parvovirus B19 can cause severe, prolonged red cell aplasia in patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency because such patients have persistent high-level viremia in the absence of antibody.11 The number of red blood cell precursors lysed and the duration of the viremic destructive phase in immunocompetent individuals with no underlying hemolytic state are usually insufficient to cause detectable anemia, but temporarily decreased red cell production can be demonstrated.11 Parvovirus B19 can cause fatal hydrops fetalis, especially when the fetus is infected during the second trimester.

IgM antibodies to B19 appear 10 to 14 days after infection and can persist for several months; neutralizing IgG antibodies generally appear about 2 weeks after infection and persist for life.12 The protective role of antibodies to parvovirus B19 is demonstrated in the efficacy of commercial immunoglobulin used to treat B19 infection in immunocompromised subjects. Recipient infections stem primarily from donors who are early in infection and have high levels of viremia, either in the absence of antibody or far in excess of the neutralizing potential of the emerging antibody. In the absence of antibody, viral levels can be as high as 1014 copies/mL.

Influenza strains are classified by their surface hemagglutinin (H) sequence (H is essential to binding to host receptors) and by their neuraminidase (N) sequence. Avian influenza viruses do not typically infect humans because their hemagglutinin configuration cannot bind to the human receptor on respiratory epithelium. Avian flu due to the H5N1 strain has emerged as a massive epidemic among chickens and other fowl in eastern and Southeast Asia and, because of the migration patterns of birds, is now spreading globally. Millions of commercial fowl have been slaughtered to contain the epidemic. Transmission from birds to humans has been increasingly documented, almost always among persons who had direct contact with infected fowl. Human to human transmission has been very limited, but there have been some household clusters18 and one case of apparent child-to-mother transmission.19 Serologic studies among household contacts20 and exposed healthcare workers do not support efficient human to human spread. Nonetheless, there is great concern that the agent will mutate by random combination to more easily spread among humans, raising the specter of a global influenza pandemic. Governments and public health services throughout the world are preparing for an eventuality that some believe is inevitable and others consider highly unlikely. The difference in opinion hinges on recombinatorial events that would foster respiratory spread of H5N1 similar to that seen with the annual waves of seasonal flu. H5N1 is anticipated to be more deadly than seasonal flu strains as it has apparently caused fatal infection in 50% of the small number of humans so far infected; death rates among infants and the young are particularly high, with one study in Thailand reporting 89% mortality among hospitalized children.21 Death is usually due to progressive respiratory failure and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, but multi-organ failure can also occur. Although the virus is not efficiently transmitted among humans, ominous signs have appeared since 1977 when the avian epidemic emerged: an increase in viral virulence factors, an enhanced replication capability, and increased resistance to interferons and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. An expanded host range in avian species, the ability to infect felids, enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected mice and ferrets and increased stability in the environment are also worrisome observations, all presaging an evolving and adapting virus that may be primed for a human outbreak. Research institutions and the pharmaceutical industry are working frantically to develop new therapeutics, an H5N1 vaccine, and cell-based vaccine systems that could adapt rapidly to whatever flu strain next emerges. In the midst of all this concern and activity, blood transfusion services have pondered the effect a flu pandemic would have on the blood supply and whether influenza is a blood-transmissible disease.",

The pathophysiology is spongiform degradation of the brain, with characteristic vacuoles and so-called florid plaques. Progression to death is inevitable, usually 9 months to a year after clinical onset. How long the infectious agent is present in the patient before clinical manifestation is unknown, but transfusion transmission has occurred from donations collected as long as 6 years prior to the appearance of frank disease.",

For the past few years there has been some degree of concern about a number of such emerging agents and, in some cases, interventions have been implemented. Unusual visceral presentations of Leishmania infection among troops involved in conflicts in the Persian Gulf countries, along with some evidence of transmissibility, led to temporary deferrals of returnees from Iraq. A potential case of transmission of Anaplasma phagocytophilum (the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichosis) has raised further interest in tick-borne infections but has not led to any interventions. In contrast, deferral measures were rapidly implemented during the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS), despite the absence of evidence of transfusion-transmissibility. Concern has been expressed about the finding of simian foamy virus (SFV) infection in some animal handlers,28 as an example of interspecies transmission of a retrovirus\u2014an event thought to reflect the origin of AIDS in human populations. Although lookback studies did not show any transmission of SFV from blood donated by infected animal handlers, and although SFV does not appear to cause disease in humans, regulatory officials have discussed the need for deferral of monkey handlers. Such a policy has been implemented in Canada; the rationale is that interspecies transfer of viruses might be accompanied by mutational events leading to newly pathogenic forms. Genetic variants of existing agents (particularly HIV and hepatitis B virus [HBV]) continue to appear, and such variants may escape detection by current methods. Several agents identified in molecular viral discovery programs have been proposed as the cause of non\u2013A-E hepatitis. These include the closely related flaviviruses, GB virus type C (GBV-C) and hepatitis G virus (HGV), and the new circoviruses, TT virus (TTV) and SEN virus (SENV). Careful clinical and epidemiologic studies have shown that these agents do not cause human hepatitis and, at present, they are agents searching for a disease.29 Finally, there is continued attention to the possibility that the hemorrhagic fever viruses will be transmissible by transfusion, a concern also extended to additional agents that might be used in bioterrorist attacks.",

Despite extensive donor testing and detailed donor histories, there remain blood-transmissible agents for which no intervention is in place and the lingering fear that a new agent with the devastating potential of HIV will emerge in the future. One answer to this escalating array of tests and risk factor exclusions is to develop and implement strategies for universal pathogen inactivation that would not only reduce or eliminate the risk of known pathogens but would preemptively destroy any significant pathogen that might emerge in the future.",

The greatest success thus far has been in the use of solvent-detergent (S-D) combinations to destroy enveloped viruses, including HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV): no transmission of these agents by S-D\u2013treated plasma derivatives has been reported since this process was implemented. Protection of the commercial plasma supply against the West Nile virus (WNV) epidemic proved the value of a preemptive strategy but also demonstrated the weakness of the S-D method: S-D can only inactivate lipid-enveloped agents and cannot be applied to red cell and platelet products whose function depends on intact lipid membranes. A clear need exists for a broad spectrum inactivation method that could be applied to cellular as well as liquid components of blood. Toward this end, many physicochemical methods to inactivate nucleic acids have been explored. The prized goal of blood safety would be a method to inactivate all viruses, regardless of their nucleic acid structure, as well as bacteria, parasites, and potentially any replicating infectious organism. In addition, the technology should inactivate lymphocytes and prevent fatal transfusion-associated graft-versus-host reactions (only prions would escape because these disease-causing abnormally folded proteins do not contain nucleic acid). Many nucleic acid\u2013inactivating agents have been investigated, most of which depend on the interaction of the effector chemical with an external light source. The system most extensively studied has been the synthetic trimethylpsoralen, designated S-59, in combination with long-wave ultraviolet light. In both plasma and platelet products, this combination inactivates all tested viruses and bacteria, whether DNA or RNA, enveloped or nonenveloped, to levels below the limits of detection, with acceptable maintenance of plasma protein levels and platelet function (but with as much as 20% loss of platelet yield).30 An alternative to psoralens for the inactivation of infectious agents in platelet products is the vitamin riboflavin (B2) in the presence of ultraviolet A.31 This seemingly safer natural vitamin has shown broad inactivation potential but may still reduce platelet survival by 15% to 30%.32\n",

Thus, the relative impracticality and high cost of existing techniques should not deter continued research towards the ideal method that would inactivate nucleic acids in all blood components in a single process and provide an unprecedented level of blood safety, There will never be zero-risk in the blood supply since problems extend beyond infectious disease transmission, but the removal of almost all infectious agents in a single inactivation process is a goal too attractive to abandon without intensive exploration.",

Additionally, as discussed above, emerging agents present new threats to blood safety. Even though the risks of such transmission are almost invariably very much lower than the risks of adverse outcomes from other medical interventions, there is a pervasive pressure to minimize or even eliminate transfusion-transmitted infections. Numerous studies have shown that the marginal costs of such measures far exceed generally accepted norms for cost-effectiveness. Such approaches are driven increasingly by very conservative application of the precautionary principle, without incorporating the usual modifying guidance. A zero-risk blood supply may not be achievable and there is no clear solution to the dilemma of defining acceptable risk. In some cases, resource limitations define the extent of available interventions. In other circumstances the impact of an intervention upon blood availability must be balanced against the gain in safety, as was done in developing deferral criteria in the United States for donor exposure to the risk of exposure to BSE. Finally, even technologies like pathogen reduction, which might offer the elimination of infectivity, may have some low, but tangible toxic risk to patients.",
