            "text": "Synonymous codons are not used equally both within and between genomes (Grantham et al., 1980, Martin et al., 1989, Lloyd and Sharp, 1992). Compositional constraints and natural selection are thought to be the two main factors accounting for codon usage variation among genes in different organisms (Karlin and Mrazek, 1996, Sharp et al., 1986, Lesnik et al., 2000). The diverse patterns of codon usage in mammals may arise from compositional constraints of the genomes (Karlin and Mrazek, 1996, Francino and Ochman, 1999, Majumdar et al., 1999, Ghosh et al., 2000). In contrast, in some unicellular organisms, such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, high expressed genes have a strong selective preference for codons with a high concentration of the corresponding acceptor tRNA molecule, whereas low expressed genes displayed a more uniform pattern of codon usage (Gouy and Gautier, 1982, Grantham et al., 1981, Ikemura, 1981, Ikemura, 1985; Sharp et al., 1986, Lesnik et al., 2000). Moreover, mutational pressure rather than translational selection is the most important determinant of the codon bias in some human RNA viruses (Levin and Whittome, 2000, Jenkins et al., 2001, Jenkins and Holmes, 2003). Furthermore, replicational and transcriptional selection is responsible for the codon usage variation among the genes of Borrelia burgdorferi (McInerney, 1998). In some other researches, codon usage was also found to be related to gene function (Chiapello et al., 1998, Epstein et al., 2000, Ma et al., 2002), protein secondary structure (Chiusano et al., 1999, Chiusano et al., 2000, Oresic and Shalloway, 1998, Xie and Ding, 1998, Gupta et al., 2000), cellular location of gene products (Chiapello et al., 1999) and gene length (Coghlan and Wolfe, 2000, Marais and Duret, 2001, Moriyama and Powell, 1998).",

Because most of these viruses contain genes coding for RNA polymerase, envelop protein and structural glycoprotein, these three gene groups were selected to find whether there is some correlation between codon usage and gene function. One tailed t-test was then performed on ENC values of these genes with the hypothesis that there is no correlation between codon usage bias and gene function. Some associations have been found. Average codon usage bias is higher in RNA polymerase gene group than in envelop gene group (t-test, P-value=0.031), and it is higher in polymerase gene group than in structural glycoprotein gene group (t-test, P-value=0.002). But, there is no association between codon usage in structural glycoprotein gene group and envelop protein gene group (t-test, P-value=0.74). Because the structural glycoprotein and envelop protein are all structural proteins in these viruses and RNA polymerase is a nonstructural protein, it is clear that codon usage in structural genes is significantly diverged from that in nonstructural genes. On the other hand, structural genes are generally highly expressed than nonstructural genes. So, if translational selection was also contributed to codon usage bias in these genes, codon usage bias in structural genes should be higher than in RNA polymerase genes. However, RNA polymerase genes (ENC=49.25) were found to have greater codon usage bias than structural genes (ENC=54.60 for envelop gene and ENC=55.33 for structural glycoprotein). Hence, codon usage bias in these virus genes is not related to gene expression level. Furthermore, we also performed a linear regression analysis on ENC value and gene length of each gene. But, there was no significant correlation between codon usage and gene length in these virus genes (P-value>0.05).

Gene function was also related to codon usage bias in these viruses to some extent. But, translational selection and gene length might have no effect on the codon usage pattern in these viruses. Some published results has shown that the overall extent of codon usage bias in RNA viruses is low and there is little variation in bias between genes (Levin and Whittome, 2000, Jenkins et al., 2001, Jenkins and Holmes, 2003). Although SARSCoV is a newly detected RNA virus infecting human, the synonymous codon usage pattern in SARSCoV we described here is also in accordance with these published codon usage pattern of human RNA viruses (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003). Because mutation rates in RNA viruses are much higher than those in DNA viruses (Drake and Holland, 1999), it is understandable that mutation pressure is the main determinant of codon usage bias in SARSCoV.

Based on different codon usage patterns in different coronaviruses, we revealed that codon usage patterns of each virus was phylogenetically distinct and SARSCoV might have been diverged far from all three known Coronavirus groups, which is in accordance with the results Qin et al.
