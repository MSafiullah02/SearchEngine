In the first two months following its discovery, over 75,000 cases of COVID-19 causing over 2,000 deaths have been confirmed. Researchers rapidly characterized the viral genome [1] and have already identified a closely related virus in bats [2] , pointing to these animals as the likely natural reservoir of this virus. The search continues for an intermediate host animal that may have facilitated the zoonosis, like camels do for MERS-CoV and palm civets did for SARS-CoV.",

Before we can address this question, it is importantly to realize that most evolutionary options available to this virus have already been explored in bats, where there is an immense array of genetically distinct coronaviruses. Viruses in the betacoronavirus genus, to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs, have likely been infecting bats for tens of millions of years, possibly since the origin of bats themselves [3] . Within this natural reservoir, viruses exist that would cause high and low virulence in humans, as well as those viruses that are easily transmissible from human to human. Evolution tinkers with these viruses in bats, and the epidemiological consequences are seen both in pathogenic zoonotic diseases (e.g., SARS, MERS, and COVID-19) and in the less-virulent circulating coronaviruses causing common colds. Occasionally, however, some evolutionary avenues are not available to a zoonotic pathogen until after arrival in humans [4] .",

Mutation is the replacement of one nucleotide base with another, or the addition/removal of nucleotide(s). Mutations are the only true source of genetic novelty. Recombination, on the other hand, can increase genetic diversity by placing existing mutations into new genetic backgrounds. Two articles in the most recent issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases explore these sources of genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2. Li and colleagues describe the genetic variability within 7 COVID-19 patients from China. Yi explores potential instances of recombination among 84 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from multiple countries.",

When these researchers examined genomes from a probable transmission pair who resided in the same house, they found the consensus sequences to be identical. However, deep-sequencing of viral genomes from 7 patients (including this probable transmission pair), the authors detect substantial variation in the number and frequency of minority variants within different individuals. Remarkably, despite the limited number of individuals included, they found many of the same minority variants in different, epidemiologically unrelated individuals. This pattern suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is predisposed towards particular mutations, which may continue to re-appear as the virus continues to spread.",

Robust phylogenetic testing for recombination cannot be performed on such closely related viruses, so Yi relies on detecting cycles in haplotype maps. These cycles represent potentially non-linear evolutionary histories of viral evolution that is consistent with recombination. However, among such closely related strains, the signal for recombination cannot be reliably disentangled from convergent evolution. A scenario for convergent evolution is plausible based the observation of recurrent minority variants reported by Li et al. Nonetheless, as more SARS-CoV-2 genomes are sequenced and analyzed, a clearer picture of the role recombination plays in SARS-CoV-2 will likely emerge.",

The viral effective population size (an amalgam of the number of productive infections and the genetic diversity) is low; thus, natural selection will be inefficient, and recombination will not result in particularly novel combinations. However, as the number of infections increases and the circulating viruses become more genetically distinct, natural selection will become more efficient, making viral adaptation more of a possibility. Nonetheless, when SARS-CoV-2 arrived in humans, it was already well suited for person-to-person transmission, with pathogenic consequences. Furthermore, it is worth remembering that the evolutionary landscape that SARS-CoV-2 will explore in humans is dwarfed by its previous exploration in bats. For now, SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation is likely evolutionarily inconsequential and will be more important for facilitating molecular epidemiology in tracing the origins of novel clusters of viral infection.",
