The impact of COVID-19 on surgical practice is widespread ranging from workforce and staffing issues, procedural prioritisation, viral transmission risk intraoperatively, changes to perioperative practice and ways of working alongside the impact on surgical education and training. Whilst there has been a growing literature base describing the early clinical course of COVID-19 and on aspects of critical care related to treating these patients, there has been a dearth of evidence on how this pandemic will affect surgical practice. This paper seeks to review the current evidence and offers recommendations for changes to surgical practice to minimise the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

As staffing deficiencies are likely due to the self-isolation of clinicians, the protection and preservation of the surgical workforce is critical for upholding the provision of emergency services. The considerations for optimal protection of the surgeon can be compartmentalised into five domains: (1) the use of PPE, (2) pre-operative risks such as during intubation, (3) specific operative risk issues, (4) post-operative risks, and (5) keeping others safe.",

Thus, advisory bodies such as the United States of America (USA) Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and Public Health England (PHE) have recommended the utilisation of PPE for all procedures involving a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection [41] . For procedures involving an aerosol-generating procedure (e.g. intubation and extubation) a higher level of protection such as N95 respirators are advised with a paramount emphasis on fit testing ( Figure 3 ) [42] . This is supported by a number of studies suggesting a relationship between viral dose and severity of disease [43] . The specific method of discarding disposable equipment should be in accordance with local policy, followed by hand hygiene [44] . In order to minimise human error, the CDC has advised a trained observer, with the sole responsibility of ensuring adherence to correct procedure, to supervise the donning process. This involves verbally walking through the procedural checklist, concluded by visual confirmation and official documentation.",

Advancements in computational fluid dynamics have enabled evaluation of OR ventilation design and monitoring procedures [63] and this in turn has established several principles relating to the design of ORs. Firstly, ventilation applies a dilution effect which minimises the concentration of contaminants, including viruses and thus it is recommended that in patients with COVID-19, the OR is set to have a high frequency of air flow changes (\u226525 per hour) to maximise this effect on reduction of viral load [59] . Secondly, contaminant diffusion is further minimised by introducing low-velocity airflow directed towards the exhaust outlets. Moreover, personnel in adjacent areas will benefit from negative pressurisation in ORs as this functions as a filtration barrier and so negative pressurisation ORs is now an official recommendation of the CDC.",
