            "text": "mRNAs are decoded by ribosomes as groups of three contiguous nucleotides (codons) on messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Each codon specifies either an amino acid or, in three cases, instructions to stop protein synthesis. Ribosomes are programmed to identify the right place to start (initiation, usually at an AUG codon encoding methionine in eukaryotes and archaea and formyl\u2010methionine in prokaryotes), and then proceed to decode the genetic information in the mRNA by marching (elongation) down the mRNA in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction 1 codon at a time until they reach one of the stop codons (termination). Central to this is that ribosomes must maintain the reading frame as defined by the initiation codon, in order to properly decode the information contained in the mRNA. Translational reading frame maintenance is an under\u2010appreciated area of research as compared to a large body of literature on e.g. mechanisms underlying tRNA charging by aminoacyl\u2010tRNA synthetases, or the accurate decoding of codons 1. From this, it follows that bad things must happen when ribosomes fail to maintain reading frame. And indeed, this is true \u2026 with some exceptions.",

            "text": "To explore these exceptions, we begin with a recent paper by Arthur and co\u2010workers 2 describing why consecutive runs of A residues rarely occur in the protein coding regions of mRNAs, and their surprising elucidation of how such polyA tracts are used to regulate gene expression. Prior studies in nucleated (eukaryotic) cells had shown that if ribosomes bypass a normal stop codon they becomes stalled on the mRNA's polyA tail. This is presumably due to the fact that the AAA codon encodes the basic amino acid lysine, and the demonstrated ability of poly\u2010basic polypeptides such as poly\u2010lysine promote ribosome stalling 3, 4, presumably through their interactions with the negatively charged ribosomal exit tunnel 5. The stalled ribosomes are recognized by a complex of proteins that remove the ribosome for recycling 6. During this process, the complex also recruits an endonuclease which cleaves the mRNA and initiates its degradation. This is called \u201cnon\u2010stop\u201d decay (NSD) because the failure of ribosomes to stop where they are supposed to results in destruction of the mRNA (reviewed in 7). While on the subject of mRNA decay, two additional mechanisms merit discussion. A second is initiated when ribosome stalling occurs in the protein coding sequence, typically due to strong mRNA structures that are difficult to unwind. Here, the same (or similar) machinery is recruited to save the ribosome and kill the message: this is called \u201cno\u2010go\u201d decay (NGD) 8, 9. Thirdly, if a ribosome encounters a stop codon in the wrong context e.g. far away from a polyA tail (called a premature termination codon, or PTC), mRNA degradation proceeds through an independent process called the nonsense\u2010mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD) (recently reviewed in 10). Note that although the ribosome is at fault in these cases, it is the messenger that pays the price.",

Surprisingly however, only runs of polyA, but not repeated AAG codons (which also encodes poly\u2010lysine) or repeated CGA or AGG (encoding poly\u2010arginine), conferred strong translational attenuation effects. Thus, something other than basic amino acid mediated ribosome stalling had to be operating.",

            "text": "Thirty years ago, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was dominating the headlines and the virus was just beginning to be characterized. Elucidation of retroviral genomic sequences by many different groups revealed a novel feature: overlapping and mutually out of frame open reading frames. This soon led to the discovery of special \u201cslippery\u201d sequences able to program elongating ribosomes to slip from one reading frame to another in a process that is called programmed \u20101 ribosomal frameshifting (\u20101 PRF) 11. In the intervening years, we and others have characterized the nature of these \u20101 PRF signals, demonstrating the importance of \u20101 PRF on virus propagation by ensuring synthesis of the correct stoichiometries of viral proteins 12, 13, 14. More recently, it has been recognized that ribosomal frameshifting and other forms of translational recoding are widely used in all three domains of life 15, 16, 17, 18. Here, we focus on \u20101 PRF in eukaryotes, where computational searches for \u201cclassic\u201d \u20101 PRF signals suggested that up to 10% of genes may be regulated by this mechanism 19. Counterintuitively, unlike viruses in which \u20101 PRF is used to synthesize two (or more) proteins from a single mRNA (Fig. 1A), more than 99% of \u20101 PRF events were predicted to direct elongating ribosomes to PTCs (Fig. 1B). Follow up studies revealed that these \u201cgenomic\u201d \u20101 PRF signals function as mRNA destabilizing elements through NMD from yeast to humans 20, 21, 22. Thus, while \u20101 PRF generally serves to expand the genomic coding content of viruses, in eukaryotes it appears to be primarily employed as a post\u2010transcriptional regulatory mechanism. However, while classic \u20101 PRF signals require slippery stretches of nucleotides, slippage is greatly stimulated by strong downstream RNA structural elements that induce elongating ribosomes to pause at the slippery sequences. Interestingly, a strong RNA secondary structural element can also promote significant rates of \u20101 PRF even in absence of an upstream canonical slippery site, albeit to a lesser extent 22. Whether the stimulatory elements actively help ribosomes to slip, or passively enhance kinetic partitioning between reading frames remains to be determined. We and others have also recently shown that \u20101 PRF can be regulated in a sequence\u2010specific manner through interaction of \u20101 PRF signals with trans\u2010acting nucleic acids e.g. naturally occurring miRNAs and synthetic oligonucleotides 21, 23, 24, 25. However, while polyA is one of the allowable \u201cslippery\u201d sequences within the coding region of an mRNA, the surprising finding was that it can direct efficient \u20101 PRF in the absence of any other stimulating element. Indeed, Arthur and colleagues demonstrated that as few as 9 A's in a row were able to promote a significant fraction of ribosomes to shift reading frame. In the context of naturally occurring polyA sequences, these were shown to direct ribosomes to PTCs, destabilizing mRNAs through NMD, thus limiting protein expression. The ability of these short polyA sequences to promote frameshifting at rates of \u223c10% in the absence of a downstream stimulatory structural element is rather surprising. While not discussed by the authors, we suggest that the presence of poly\u2010lysine in the ribosome exit tunnel may cause ribosomes to pause over the slippery polyA sequence, thus enhancing their ability to kinetically partition into the \u20101 frame. If so, this suggests that at least two different \u20101 PRF mechanisms convergently evolved as mRNA destabilizing elements to control gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Additionally, Gene Ontogeny analysis of polyA track containing messages identified by Arthur et al. reveals that approximately 12% are located in mRNAs encoding trans\u2010acting regulatory factors involved in stress response and apoptosis. While this suggests a regulatory role for these sequences, no suggestion for how such regulation may be effected has been presented. In addition, the fact that polyA sequences do not promote slippage into the +1 frame is also interesting: while not discussed by the authors, perhaps this observation is instructive about the fundamental nature of how ribosomes naturally maintain reading frame.",

Since this is an inverse exponential relationship, small changes in frameshifting can have large effects on gene expression. This suggests that \u20101 PRF is a translational attenuation mechanism that functions to balance gene dosage. Intriguingly, most \u20101 PRF signals promote 1\u201310% frameshifting: this lies in the linear range of the plot where changes in \u20101 PRF efficiencies are predicted to promote the largest changes in mRNA abundances.",

In elegant studies using B. subtilis, Losick and co\u2010workers have shown that switching between two morphological cell types is controlled not by the absolute numbers of regulatory molecules, but by their relative ratios 26. This represents an important paradigmatic change: rather the Galilean quantitative numerical emphasis, it returns our understanding of biological regulation to the classical ratiometric Euclidian view. Curiously, included in the first report of yeast mutants in which \u20101 PRF was globally elevated was the observation that many of the mutants had temperature\u2010dependent cell cycle defects 27. Twenty years later, the basis for this was elucidated: in yeast, telomere maintenance is controlled by \u20101 PRF 22. Global increases in \u20101 PRF imbalances the stoichiometries of key proteins that are either intrinsic to telomerase itself (Est1p and Est2p), or involved in telomerase recruitment to chromosome ends (Stn1p, Cdc13p). We hypothesize changes in the relative ratios of these proteins inhibits telomerase activity and/or recruitment to chromosome ends, triggering \u201ccheckpoint arrest\u201d as cells work to repair this particular DNA synthesis defect before committing to cell division. This accounts for the observed cell cycle arrest phenotypes upon global dysregulation of \u20101 PRF. Notably, this phenomenon was also observed upon inhibition of NMD, consistent with the epistatic relationship of NMD to \u20101 PRF. Importantly, this places pressure on cells to select for mutations that bypass this quality control checkpoint, most commonly by \u201crepairing\u201d telomeres using the double stranded break repair apparatus. Unfortunately, this approach requires templating by homologous sequences, i.e. the ends of other chromosomes, which can lead to chromosome fusion, breakage during mitosis, and eventually aneuploidy. Unpublished finding from our laboratory have recently validated \u20101 PRF signals in some human mRNAs encoding telomere maintenance proteins, suggesting the evolutionary conservation of \u20101 PRF in chromosome end maintenance.",

            "text": "As noted above, we estimate that \u223c10% of nuclear encoded mRNAs harbor classic \u20101 PRF signals, and another \u223c2% harbor slippery polyA sequences; a respectable number of genes. Thus, it follows that defects in \u20101 PRF due to defective ribosomes may be significant drivers of disease. The importance of ribosomes and human health has emerged over the past decade through the emergence of a class of diseases collectively called Ribosomopathies 28. Originally associated with genetically inherited anemias, it is becoming clear that mutations that affect ribosome biogenesis and/or ribosome function have dire consequences. Interestingly, while patients with classic ribosomopathies such as Shwachman\u2013Bodian\u2013Diamond syndrome and X\u2010linked dyskeratosis congenita (X\u2010DC) initially present with hypo\u2010proliferative cellular disorders e.g. anemias, should they survive this phase of the disease, they are at much higher risk of developing cancers of the same tissue bed, i.e. cellular hyper\u2010proliferation. This seeming paradox is known in the field of hematology as Dameshek's Riddle 29. Using X\u2010DC as a model, we showed that rRNA hypopseudouridylation decreases the affinity of ribosomes for at least two classes of RNA ligands, internal ribosomal entry signals (IRES) and tRNAs 30. While this leads to decreased expression of IRES containing mRNAs (emerging as an important driver of cancer 31), this biochemical defect also renders tRNAs more likely to slip at \u20101 PRF signals. The effects of X\u2010DC associated mutations on \u20101 PRF and gene expression is currently a topic of intense research. Unpublished findings from our laboratory also suggests that mutations associated with other classic ribosomopathies affect various aspects of translational fidelity, including \u20101 PRF, and hence gene expression.",

            "text": "An understanding of how somatically acquired mutations that affect translational reading frame maintenance may also underlie other cancers is beginning to take shape. Exome sequencing initially revealed a conserved mutation in the gene encoding ribosomal protein L10 (also known as uL16 32) in \u223c10% of T\u2010cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias 33, and followup studies revealed that this mutation promotes globally increased rates of \u20101 PRF 34, 35. Current efforts are aimed at characterizing how this affects gene expression and drives carcinogenesis. Additionally, while ribosomopathies are currently defined as diseases caused by defective ribosomes, it is not inconceivable that mutations that affect other components of the translational apparatus may also be pathogenic. Case in point: spinocerebellar ataxia 26 (SCA26) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in EEF2, encoding the translational translocase eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which promotes increased rates of \u20101 PRF both in yeast 36, and in patient\u2010derived cells (unpublished). Altered rates of ribosomal slippage may not only affect gene expression by altering mRNA abundances. The increased expression of C\u2010terminally truncated dead end polypeptides may also burden the cellular protein degradation apparatus. Indeed, yeast cells harboring the EEF2\u2010SCA26 mutation show a more robust unfolded protein response (UPR) induction in response to antioxidant and heat shock challenges 36. This may be of importance with regard to neurological disease in particular as Purkinje neurons are known to be vulnerable to a wide variety of molecular and cellular insults 37. The links between \u20101 PRF and proteostaic insult represent a critical, underexplored area of investigation. Additionally, unlike the stringent quality control mechanisms governing ribosome biogenesis 38, no such control governing trans\u2010acting factors like eEF2 are known. Thus, diseases associated with mutations in this class of proteins should be rare and may be expected to present as hypoproliferative only.",

However, given that global changes in \u20101 PRF appear to be deleterious, regulation of \u20101 PRF would have to be sequence\u2010specific. microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non\u2010coding RNAs naturally participate in sequence\u2010specific interactions with mRNAs, and thus present the logical places to look for trans\u2010acting regulators of individual \u20101 PRF signals. With this in mind, computational methods were used to identify two miRNAs that interact with and stimulate \u20101 PRF promoted by a sequence element in the mRNA encoding CCR5, a cytokine receptor that is used as a co\u2010receptor for HIV\u20101 21. A series of genetic and biochemical experiments revealed that one of these, miR\u20101224, directly interacts with the CCR5 \u20101 PRF stimulating mRNA pseudoknot. Presumably, the interaction stabilizes the pseudoknot, rendering it more difficult for ribosomes to resolve. This would increase ribosome pause times at the slippery site, stimulating kinetic partitioning into the \u20101 frame. Theoretically, miRNAs may also have \u20101 PRF inhibitory activities by being able to destabilize \u20101 PRF promoting mRNA downstream elements. In support of this, siRNA knockdown of the cellular miRNA processing apparatus stimulated \u20101 PRF promoted by some frameshift signals, and inhibited \u20101 PRF promoted by others 21. Non\u2010coding RNA stimulation of \u20101 PRF at polyA sequences may also be possible. In support of this, hybridization of antisense linked nucleic acids (LNAs) immediately 3\u2032 of heptameric slippery sequences was sufficient to promote efficient \u20101 frameshifting in the absence of any other stimulatory element 39. Natural attenuation of \u20101 PRF by stem\u2010loop structures immediately 5\u2032 of coronavirus slippery sequences has also been reported 40, a phenomenon that can be replicated by hybridization of oligonucleotides complementary to sequences lying just upstream of slippery sites 41. These studies establish the role of ncRNAs in regulating translational fidelity and suggest that regulation of \u20101 PRF may not be limited to miRNAs. Missing, however, is any hypothesis or model explaining how polyA\u2010directed \u20101 PRF may be specifically regulated. The demonstration of protein\u2010induced transactivation of frameshifting in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 42 may provide a clue in this respect; perhaps polyA\u2010mediated \u20101 PRF may be regulated by polyA\u2010binding proteins.",

What other ribosomal frameshift promoting elements may be out there, and how might they be identified? An approach for discovering new \u20101 PRF signals that has worked particularly well with viruses and bacteria has been to first detect evolutionarily conserved reading frames and then, using molecular genetics tools, identify and characterize the translational recoding elements 16. Mining of ribosome profiling data to pinpoint frameshifted ribosomes, and from there identifying the elements that made them shift reading frame presents a new and promising approach 21, 43. The recent discovery of modified bases in mRNAs and their regulation 44, 45, raises the question of how these may affect the ability of ribosomes to maintain reading frame. Additionally, although we have known about mRNA editing for quite some time (reviewed in 46), its role in creating or ablating \u20101 PRF signals remains completely unexplored. Furthermore, identifying the trans\u2010acting factors (miRNAs, other ncRNAs and even proteins) that regulate specific \u20101 PRF signals, characterizing how their expression is regulated, and how dysregulation may be linked to disease is another open research area. Lastly, as outlined in Fig. 3, \u20101 PRF and NMD present as therapeutic targets, not only with regard to viral diseases, e.g. HIV/AIDS, but also as a potential modality to fine tune and correct errors in gene expression, either using small molecules that target specific \u20101 PRF signals to correct the expression of specific genes (e.g. using synthetic RNA\u2010like molecules) or using therapeutics that correct for changes in gene expression due to global defects in \u20101 PRF.",
