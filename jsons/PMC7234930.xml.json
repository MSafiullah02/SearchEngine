With the world in crisis, there is renewed focus on theoretical tensions within the postdigital condition, and my interest is in unique female insights and their positioning in postdigital theory and practice (Deepwell 2020). How does women\u2019s learning intersect across physical spaces, digital infrastructures and learning ecologies? Or is it perhaps somewhere else, across all of these, as well as in-between (Pyyhtinen and Suoranta 2020)? How do these online practices affect women from different cultures? What precisely does it mean to be postdigital if you are female (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2019)? How can a postdigital critical pedagogy be informed by feelings of love, kindness and compassion for learning, learners and one another, while hopefully keeping women employed (Petrilli 2017)? These questions were pertinent prior to Covid-19, they are particularly poignant now, and they are imperative for future development of postdigital feminist theory and practice.",

I even worry about the inherent value system within this ordering of worries. Yet these conversations about our feelings, of both unease and excitement, evoke a surreal sense of the uncanny (Jandri\u0107 and Kuzmani\u0107 2020).

Despite the lack of preparation, classes must be taught, exams must be taken, and appearances must be upheld (Goffman 1956). Our collective uncertainty, exhaustion, fear and inadequacies are not voiced, since they are the deeply buried secrets and silences of the neoliberal university (Gill 2009). My work during the Covid-19 lockdown started with preparing for online meetings by wearing red lipstick, downscaled to beige, and now I wear no lipstick at all. It\u2019s a struggle to get dressed some days. I rarely brush my hair. While I teach online, grade assignments and procrastinate, I imagine my own kids are baking, playing music, working out and getting much more sleep. Unsurprisingly, they appreciate aspects of their unexpected deschooling (Illich 1970).",

What happens in the end, like always, will depend on context. Online education is more than choosing a suitable learning management system or having adequate Wi-Fi connectivity. Technological affordances are also about emerging macro, meso and micro postdigital practices, which are socio-material, situated and contextual. Visual affordances such as video conferencing or profile pictures also depend on particular kinds of literacies that are acquired through processes of learning, and these processes are contingent with particular cultural ways of seeing and being seen. Visual culture is \u2018both globalizing and localizing quite often simultaneously\u2019 (Gruber and Haugbolle 2013: x). Working at a women\u2019s only university in the Gulf makes me wonder about the micropractices of my students and pragmatic choices facing them on a daily basis. How do they juggle family life and financial restraints, while justifying to themselves that it is worth working towards a university degree, in the time of lockdown, and with such an uncertain future ahead?",

This privilege and opportunity follow an edict of \u2018empowerment.\u2019 In the United Arab Emirates for example, \u2018The National Strategy for Empowerment of Emirati Women\u2019 mandates \u2018how women are empowered through services and facilities in the areas of education, health, jobs and more\u2019 (The United Arab Emirates\u2019 Government portal 2015). Similarly, Qatar\u2019s Commission on the Status of Women and the Qatar National Vision 2030 prioritizes the empowerment of women (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2017). These policies legislating the empowerment of women are linked to the region\u2019s attempts to become knowledge economies yet are embedded within a number of contradictions and challenges. Resulting data trails paint inspiring yet somewhat unconvincing pictures of participation. In terms of immediate practices, the coronavirus crisis exacerbates the fault lines, or less obvious issues, facing Gulf-Arab women learners and teachers in Muslim majority countries. While these issues may not seem apparent on the surface, since most women have access to the devices and Wi-Fi necessary for online learning, there are deeper systemic issues.",

A disembodied voice asks, \u2018Isn\u2019t a woman\u2019s face a blemish upon her, a shameful private part to be covered?\u2019 However, choosing whether or not to cover your face or hair is often a cultural or personal decision rather than a strictly religious choice (Killian 2019). Conversely, while Islam has been perceived as a faith that avoids iconic images, there has been a staple of Islamic representational arts and manuscripts decorated with figural and animal imagery from the thirteenth century onward (Gruber 2015).",

A number of Gulf-Arab women are social media influencers, or microcelebrities, enjoying prolific followings without necessarily ever showing their faces online (Hurley 2019a). Nevertheless, while women make up over 60% of university graduates, they experience double the amount of unemployment (Culbertson 2016). Such paradoxes play out visually at multiple levels. For example, traditional customs of wearing the abaya and hijab continue as religious and ethnic symbols, yet these practices have become nuanced and experimental with design, fabrics, cut and ornamentation. While often avoiding overt displays of the face or body online, Gulf-Arab women\u2019s self-presentations represent intricate narratives concerning the fragmentation of \u2018self\u2019 and the multiple roles that social actors are asked to perform during the current global crisis and the regimes of postdigital hyper-visuality, whereby each sign embeds histories, systemic relations and cultural values.",

Gulf-Arab women are responding in distinct ways to what Katy Deepwell (2020) calls the \u2018plug and play\u2019 models of education that are mediated via generic platform architectures. Their responses to fill-in boxes, choices of colour schemes and visual identity templates are situated within specific socio-material contexts (Hurley 2019a). Reflexive responses of Gulf-Arab women are significant because they indicate that postdigital visual regimes, although increasingly standardized, are not necessarily taken up in universal ways. Furthermore, we need to understand more about hybrid visual micropractices and postdigital self-presentations across the merging offline/online learning contexts which are both local and global. These are significant issues and reveal the extent to which postdigital visual regimes are not monolithic. Although it is generally accepted that everyone lives a global life, what might be backgrounded is the extent to which these lives are also vastly differentiated through being local (Giddens 1999).",

These issues raise questions about postdigital assemblages, which involve entanglements of human agency within matter, materialism, technologies and hyper-visualities (Barad 2007; Haraway 1987). These assemblages also involve varying modes of technological corporate and state surveillance as well as women\u2019s own gendered self-surveillance. A postdigital perspective could help to reveal how visual regimes bundle ideologies of traditionalism, gender inequalities, postcolonialism and late capitalism in contradictory matrices.",

These questions occur at macro and meso levels to consider policy concerning learners and online learning practices, yet they also require a focus on women\u2019s intersectional micropractices. Detailed insights into hybrid responses to visual learning regimes may not become apparent at global levels, nor through conceiving of women\u2019s empowerment in exclusively economic and/or legislative terms. Although these are important starting points, top-down theorizing involves a tendency to limit insights into learners and educators\u2019 varying practices and differences. We need to develop more nuanced ways of seeing to consider the literal blind spots surrounding women\u2019s learning and hyper-inequalities in the Global South.",
