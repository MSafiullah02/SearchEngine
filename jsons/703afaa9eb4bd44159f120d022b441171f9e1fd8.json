Methods and Results: Ag/SBA-15 materials were prepared by means of incipient wetness impregnation, impregnation and direct hydrothermal synthesis methods. The antimicrobial activity of Ag/SBA-15 was investigated using Escherichia coli as an indicator bacterium, and the antimicrobial mechanism was explored. The properties and Ag + release behaviour of Ag/ SBA-15 materials were compared. Experimental results showed that Ag/SBA-15 materials resulted in 7\u00c15 log inactivation of E. coli for only 60 min, which exhibited very high antimicrobial activities at room temperature without using any light or electrical power input. The cell wall and cell membrane were destroyed in the antimicrobial process, leading to leakage of intracellular components. The formation of extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the bactericidal process was confirmed. Production of intracellular ROS was also discovered. Conclusions: Ag/SBA-15 exhibited high antimicrobial activity against E. coli. This antimicrobial effect was a synergistic action between extracellular ROS and the toxicity of Ag + , which induced intracellular ROS production and subsequent cell death. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study revealed for the first time the antimicrobial activities and mechanisms of Ag/SBA-15 materials prepared with different methods.",

            "text": "Human beings are often exposed to and infected by micro-organisms such as bacteria, moulds and viruses during day to day living. Accordingly, the use of antimicrobial agents is important to maintain a sanitary environment and avoid infection. Among various antimicrobial metals, silver has a wide antimicrobial spectrum and relatively high safety (TIC 1998) . Concerns have been raised, however, regarding the bactericidal activity of silver nanoparticles that exhibit considerable antibacterial activity (Sondi and Salopek-Sondi 2004; Chamakura et al. 2011; Ivanova et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2011; Schacht et al. 2012) . A comprehensive review on the antimicrobial action and mechanism of silver nanoparticles has been reported by Rai et al. (2012) . However, silver nanoparticles usually gather into large particles, leading to a decrease in antimicrobial activity. To decrease silver usage and cost and increase the stability of antimicrobial agents, it is necessary to load silver onto inorganic carriers. Recently, many environmentally friendly inorganic antibacterial materials containing silver have been developed, with some now in commercial use (Kawahara et al. 2000; Wan et al. 2001; He et al. 2004; Pape et al. 2004; Chang et al. 2008a,b; Kwakye-Awuah et al. 2008; Lalueza et al. 2011) . Therefore, the development of inorganic bactericides and disinfectants by loading silver onto various inorganic carriers is receiving extensive attention for application in domestic and industrial fields.",

            "text": "Mesoporous silicas, such as SBA-15, possessing high surface area, porous volume and adjustable pore size diameter, are ideal supports. Their remarkably high surface area favours the high dispersion of active components on the support surface, and the improved accessibility of active sites for reaction gases should have a favourable impact on catalytic activity (Sayari 1996; Tian et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, if antimicrobial metals could be confined in the mesopores of SBA-15, the elution amount of metals might be largely reduced. Because of its excellent properties as a catalytic support, SBA-15 is one of the most promising carriers for the development of high-performance antimicrobial materials. Antimicrobial material using silver nanocrystals encapsulated in mesoporous silica MCM-41 has been prepared previously and was found to exhibit high antimicrobial efficacy against bacteria (Liong et al. 2009 ). Cai et al. (2006) prepared silver-loaded SBA-15 material through a silver mirror reaction and used it as an effective bactericide against Staphylococcus. Up to now, reports on the interaction of silver-loaded mesoporous silicas with bacteria are rare, and the antimicrobial mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, further work is needed to study the antimicrobial activity, antimicrobial mechanism and chemical durability of silver-loaded mesoporous silica.",

These micro-organisms could be completely inactivated within 30 min on the Ag/Al 2 O 3 surface at room temperature in air. When Ag/Al 2 O 3 was used in water, the elution of Ag + from the catalyst into water was a problem. Although Ag-Ce/AlPO 4 could significantly decrease the elution of Ag + , the catalyst showed only moderate bactericidal activity. Therefore, to develop an excellent antibacterial material with high antimicrobial activity and chemical durability, silver-loaded mesoporous silica SBA-15 (Ag/SBA-15) antimicrobial materials were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (Ag/SBA-15(IWI)), impregnation (Ag/SBA-15(I)) and direct hydrothermal synthesis (Ag/SBA-15(DHS)). It was expected that the incipient wetness impregnation method would decrease the elution of Ag + from the antimicrobial material into water by immobilizing Ag in the pores of SBA-15. Using E. coli as an indicator bacterium, the antimicrobial activities and mechanism of the Ag/SBA-15 materials were investigated by examining the diameter of the inhibition zone, bactericidal activity, effects of ROS and Ag + and morphological changes during the process of cell death.",

Table 1 gives the surface areas, pore diameters and pore volumes of SBA-15 and 1 wt% Ag/SBA-15 samples prepared by the three synthesis methods. As expected, the surface area of SBA-15 decreased after Ag was loaded. The sequence of surface areas was in accordance with the micropore volume (V micro ), with SBA-15 > Ag/SBA-15(IWI) > Ag/ SBA-15(I) > Ag/SBA-15(DHS). The mesopore volume (V meso ) of SBA-15 was the highest, and V meso of Ag/SBA-15(IWI) was the lowest. These results indicated that incipient wetness impregnation mainly induced the blockage of mesoporous pores with Ag particles. However, impregnation and direct hydrothermal synthesis predominately led to blockage of microporous pores during the preparation processes. Furthermore, the largest decrease in V meso and smallest decrease in surface area observed with Ag/SBA-15(IWI) also confirmed that Ag particles were mostly loaded into the mesoporous pores of Ag/SBA-15(IWI). Figure 1 presents the morphologies of SBA-15 and 1 wt% Ag/SBA-15 samples. In Fig. 1(b) , 1 wt% Ag/ SBA-15(IWI) presented a regular columnar shape in comparison with the original SBA-15 shown in Fig. 1(a) .

Obviously, incipient wetness impregnation resulted in Ag being confined in the inner walls of SBA-15, which corresponded to the data of Table 1 .

The 0\u00c15 wt% Ag/ SBA-15 also induced a 4-5 log unit reduction in viable cells, which revealed that even a low amount of silver exhibited high bactericidal activity. For the control, with SBA-15 addition, viable cell count was reduced by a 1\u00c10 log unit after 30 min, probably because of the adsorption function of the support.

The eluted Ag + concentrations measured for various specimens after different periods in water with vigorous stirring are shown in Table 3 . As shown from Table 3 , the concentration of Ag + eluted from Ag/SBA-15 (IWI) was only 0\u00c1039 mg l \u00c01 within 120 min. However, after 120 min, the amounts of Ag + eluted from Ag/SBA-15 (I) and (DHS) were 0\u00c1275 and 0\u00c1498 mg l \u00c01 , respectively. It is worth noting that the amount of Ag + eluted from Ag/ SBA-15(IWI) was much less than that from Ag/SBA-15(I) and (DHS), indicating that incipient wetness impregnation largely reduced the speed of silver elution and decreased the potential health risk to human beings. The maximum permissible concentration level of Ag + in drinking water is 0\u00c109 mg l \u00c01 , as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) (S\u20ac okmen et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2003) . The obvious decrease in the release rate of Ag + might be due to the slow diffusion in mesopores. Furthermore, at a concentration of 0\u00c15 mg l \u00c01 , Ag + showed low bactericidal activity within 60 min (Fig. 3b) , while the concentration of Ag + eluted from all Ag/SBA-15 materials was less than 0\u00c15 mg l \u00c01 within 120 min. These results clearly suggest that the toxicity of Ag + in solution was not fully responsible for the inactivation of E. coli by Ag/SBA-15. Considering that Ag/SBA-15, as an oxidative catalyst (Tian et al. 2009 ), should have the capacity to transform O 2 into ROS that might contain superoxide anions (\u02d9O \u00c0 2 ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxyl radicals (\u02d9OH), we supposed that ROS catalytically formed by the catalyst might also contribute to the bactericidal effect of Ag/SBA-15 during the bactericidal process. The differences in bactericidal activities among Ag/SBA-15(IWI), (I) and (DHS) shown in Fig. 3 (b) might be due to the different concentrations of Ag + eluted and the different amounts of ROS that could diffuse and come into contact with E. coli. In the following experiments, ROS scavengers were added to clarify the effect of extracellular ROS on bactericidal activity.",

Fig. 4 . The bactericidal effect was weakened by the addition of catalase or methanol, compared with the control experiment without any ROS scavengers, at corresponding time intervals. When two scavengers (SOD and catalase) were introduced together, the bactericidal effect decreased further. These results suggest the formation of\u02d9O \u00c0 2 , H 2 O 2 and\u02d9OH on the Ag/ SBA-15(IWI) surface and their contribution to the bactericidal effect. As previously reported, transition metals such as silver can catalyse H 2 O 2 , resulting in the formation of\u02d9OH (Inoue et al. 2002; Pape et al. 2004) . Furthermore, to exclude the effect of Ag + existing on the surface or in mesopores of catalysts as well as dissociated Ag + , bactericidal activity was examined in physiological saline. The bactericidal activity noticeably decreased in physiological saline compared with that in deionized water. The effect of physiological saline was higher than the toxicity of Ag + alone (Fig. 3b) , indicating that Ag + on the surface or in the mesopores of the catalyst played a catalytic role because the redox process of Ag 0 /Ag + usually contributes to the formation of ROS through Fenton-like reactions. The growth curve of E. coli in water was the same as that in 0\u00c19% NaCl with no addition of Ag/SBA-15. Thus, the bactericidal effect of Ag/ SBA-15 was a synergistic action of extracellular ROS and Ag + . Similar phenomena were found in the bactericidal processes of Ag/SBA-15(I) and (DHS) (not shown).",

Compared with the normal cells shown in Fig. 6(a) , the cells were no longer uniform following cell wall disruption, leakage of intracellular constituents leading to small protuberances (indicated by arrows) and condensation of cell cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic membrane of some cells shrank and became detached from the cell wall (indicated by double-arrow) (Fig. 6b,d) , which might be attributable to the interaction between Ag + and thiol groups in cytoplasmic protein (Feng et al. 2000) . Chang et al. (2008a,b) previously observed the same phenomenon after treatment with 1 mg l \u00c01 Ag + . Furthermore, the different morphological changes in E. coli cells treated with Ag/SBA-15 (IWI) and those treated with Ag + implied that two different antimicrobial mechanisms were involved. The formation of extracellular ROS was active in destroying the cells. The membrane integrity of the cells was reflected by the influx of membrane-impermeable fluorescent PI since PI can only influx into cells with disrupted membranes. Figure 7 shows that the number of PI-positive cells treated with Ag/SBA-15 was obviously higher than that of PI-positive cells treated with SBA-15 only. These results suggest that the antimicrobial ability of Ag/SBA-15 involved the disruption of membrane integrity through the generation of intracellular ROS.",

On the basis of the TEM investigation and PI-positive results, after treatment with Ag/SBA-15 (IWI), (I) and (DHS), the cell wall and cell membrane were destroyed, which might lead to a change in cell membrane permeability and leakage of intracellular substances. K + exists universally in bacteria (Heefner 1982; Lu et al. 2003) and plays an important role in the regulation of polysome content and protein synthesis. The release of intracellular protein and nucleic acid is also an important indicator of cell membrane damage (Woo et al. 2000; Hong et al. 2004) . Therefore, leakage of K + , nucleic acid and protein from E. coli cells was used to further examine the permeability and damage of the cell membrane. Table 3 shows the changes in K + , nucleic acid and protein concentrations in the presence of various 1 wt% Ag/SBA-15 samples, with SBA-15 as the control. In the case of the SBA-15 control, there was almost 0\u00c11 mg l \u00c01 of K + leakage from E. coli cells, and the amount of K + had no observable increase for 60 min. In the presence of Ag/SBA-15, however, about 0\u00c12 mg l \u00c01 of K + leaked from the bacterial cells just 10 min after the addition of samples, which should be attributed to a notable change in the structure of the outer membrane. The K + concentration increased with increasing time and reached relatively steady values after 60 min, when nearly 100% cell inactivation was achieved. Nucleic acid and its related compounds, such as pyrimidines and purines, were detected using a NanoDrop spectrometer. The leakage concentration of nucleic acid of cells treated with 1 wt% Ag/SBA-15 was 2-5 times higher than the 1\u00c11 ng ll \u00c01 of the control suspension. Furthermore, the release of intracellular proteins was also found in suspension for injured cells. The amount of protein released into the treated cell suspension was much higher than that released into the control suspension. The presence of these intracellular contents in suspension indicated severe damage to cells at the membrane level. The cell wall and membrane damage was achieved through intracellular ROS induced by extracellular ROS with strongly oxidizing properties and Ag + .",

The amount of Ag + eluted from Ag/SBA-15 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation was lower than the maximum permissible concentration level of 0\u00c109 mg l \u00c01 Ag + in drinking water declared by the WHO.

Such metal nanoparticles interact with microbial cells through multiple biochemical pathways, for instance, via Ag + and the production of ROS (Marambio-Jones and Hoek 2010). ROS can damage cell structures and ultimately cause cell death (Neal 2008; Su et al. 2009 ). It is well known that Ag + in high concentrations exhibits bactericidal activity (Feng et al. 2000; Matsumura et al. 2003) , and Ag + elution from Ag-loaded materials cannot be avoided under the experimental conditions. Lalueza et al. (2011) reported that 1\u00c15 mg l \u00c01 of silver nitrate did not show significant antimicrobial effects. Our results also showed that at a concentration of 0\u00c15 mg l \u00c01 , Ag + showed low bactericidal activity. In this study, Ag + concentration was lower than the 0\u00c15 mg l \u00c01 eluted from each Ag/SBA-15 catalyst prepared with different methods, which indicated that the antimicrobial activity did not depend on the toxicity of silver ions only.",

Importantly, extracellular ROS induced intracellular ROS production and death of cells. Moreover, Ag + also aided in the generation of intracellular ROS, which were produced through respiratory enzymes by Ag + (Matsumura et al. 2003) . This was proved by the appearance of DCF-positive cells treated with 0\u00c15 mg l \u00c01 Ag + (Fig. 5) . In all, the catalytically antimicrobial effect should be considered as a synergic action of extracellular ROS and Ag + . Intracellular ROS was the candidate mediator for the death of cells involved in the Ag/SBA-15 antimicrobial system. Furthermore, physiological disturbances such as electron transport and respiration might occur in the Ag/SBA-15 system like the effects of many metals. Bacteria were cytostatic when in contact with AgNP/Clay, implying that the motor function of the cytoskeletons was hampered (Su et al. 2009 ). Previous research also indicated that silver nanoparticles affected membrane receptor internalization and cellular signalling and protein expression (Jiang et al. 2008) . Yamanaka et al. (2005) confirmed that silver ions could penetrate cells and affect ribosomal subunit proteins and some enzymes important for bacterial cells. Furthermore, owing to the membrane damage caused by silver nanoparticles, cells cannot effectively extrude Ag + and restrict their effect (Hwang et al. 2008) . According to the literature and production of intracellular ROS, some Ag/ SBA-15 particles that contacted with cells might have disturbed normal physiological function of membrane proteins, such as channels or receptors, and consequently interfered with the proton pool in the membrane space or the electronic flow through the respiratory chain. Accumulated electrons could be transferred to oxygen to form intracellular ROS, leading to oxidative damage and membrane leakage in bacteria.",

The antimicrobial effect was a synergistic action of extracellular ROS and toxicity of Ag + , which induced the production of intracellular ROS and death of cells. With strong oxidizing properties, ROS resulted in the destruction of the cell wall and cell membrane of E. coli, leading to leakage of intracellular components such as K + , nucleic acid and protein. Considering the low amount of Ag + elution, the Ag/SBA-15(IWI) mesoporous material prepared by incipient wetness impregnation was the most promising antimicrobial technology application for drinking water treatment.
