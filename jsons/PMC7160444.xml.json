            "text": "Indeed, understanding the physiology and mechanisms of these agents can aid in discussion with patients. CD4+ T-cell immunity is critical to host defense against viral pathogens. Antiviral T-cell responses are initiated with the uptake of viral antigen in infected tissue, activation of T cells by viral recognition and pathogen signaling, and cytokine polarization toward a T-helper (Th) type-1 profile via interleukin (IL) 12 and type 1 interferon.4 Importantly, Th17, Th2, and regulatory (Treg) T-cell populations may also be generated to some degree to combat infection against certain viral pathogens. It stands to reason that the use of biologic therapies known to modulate and blunt Th1 responses, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 inhibitors, abatacept (CTLA-4 inhibitor), and ustekinumab (IL-12/23 inhibitor), may specifically require more stringent precautions to diminish risk of infection and prioritization of alternative therapeutic agents when possible.5 The effect of IL-17 inhibitors and dupilumab (IL-4 blockade), which predominately impair Th17 pathways and Th2 pathways, respectively, on SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown and, for now, also warrants caution. Additionally, the use of nonbiologic systemic therapies, such as cyclosporin, azathioprine, and methotrexate, warrants similar precautions because their therapeutic mechanisms create a state of generalized immunosuppression in the host.",
