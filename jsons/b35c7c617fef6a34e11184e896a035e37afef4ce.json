            "text": "23 Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious pathogenic virus that 24 causes severe diarrhea and dehydration in pigs of all ages. Deoxynivalenol (DON), the 25 most abundant trichothecene in food and feed, causes vomit and diarrhea in animals 26 and human. However, whether DON exposure could affect PEDV infection remains 27 unknown. Herein, we investigated the impacts of DON on entry and replication of 28 PEDV, morbidity situation of piglets and the mechanisms involved. In vivo, twenty-29 seven piglets infected naturally with PEDV were randomly divided into three groups, 30 receiving the basal diet containing 0, 750 and 1500 \u03bcg/kg DON, respectively. We 31 observed significant increases in the diarrhea rates, the villous injury of jejunums and 32 the PEDV proliferation of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and mesenterium of piglets in 33 experimental groups compared with control. Additionally, the autophagosome-like 34 vesicles and the autophagy-related protein expressions were also increased in 35 experimental groups. In vitro, we observed that, approximately 2 hrs post-infection, 36 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM DON promoted PEDV entry (P < 0.05) in IPEC-J2s and resulted 37 in tight junction protein occludin internalization. Knockdown of occludin and 38 CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of LC3B indicated a vital role of autophagy-induced 39 occludin internalization in DON-promoted PEDV entry. We also observed that, 24 hrs 40 post-infection, a significant increase in PEDV replication after 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM 41 DON treatment, along with the induction of a complete autophagy. Specifically, 42 deletion of LC3B indicated a crucial role of autophagy in DON-promoted PEDV 3 43 replication. Pretreatment with SB202190, a p38 signaling inhibitor, abolished the 44 induction of autophagy. Furthermore, downregulation of type I interferon revealed that 45 DON contributed PEDV to escape innate immune. Mechanistically, DON-caused 46 innate immune escape was related to the upregulation of LC3B, which further inhibited 47 STING phosphorylation. Taken together, DON could promote PEDV infection by 48 inducing occludin internalization and innate immune escape via triggering p38-49 mediated autophagy. 50 Author summary 53 Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a devastating enteric disease, leads to catastrophic 54 economic loss to the global pig industry. Its primary pathogen is the coronavirus PED 55 virus (PEDV). Growing evidence indicates that pathogen infection is not the only factor 56 of PED outbreaks, other non-infectious factors is also related to this disease. We 57 guessed some ubiquitous substances, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), that lead to pig 58 intestinal epithelial cell stress might encourage the progress and spread of PED. In the 59 present study, the weaning piglets infected naturally with PEDV and the IPEC-J2 cell 60 line were selected as models to explore the effects of DON on PEDV infection, 61 morbidity and gut barrier. Our results showed that DON exposure can promote PEDV 62 infection in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanism might be related to LC3B-63 mediated autophagy. Our findings reveal new pathways for developing potential novel 4 64 antiviral strategies against PEDV infection. 65 Results 100 Low doses exposure of DON could aggravate intestinal injury and facilitate PEDV 101 infection in weaning piglets 102 To evaluate the effects of DON exposure on PEDV-infected piglets, we performed 103 animal experiments. Twenty-seven piglets infected naturally with PEDV were 104 randomly divided into three groups: group I received a basal diet, group II received the 105 basal diet containing 750 \u03bcg/kg DON; group III received the basal diet containing 1500 6",

            "text": "But, how did DON-activated autophagy promote PEDV replication? The primary 327 role of autophagy in innate immune is regulating the IFN-I expression [44, 45]. It is 328 well known that IFN-I is an important antiviral defense cytokine in innate immunity. 329 Upregulation of IFN-I can inhibit viral proliferation, whereas downregulation of it 330 contributes to virus infection [46]. PEDV infection is one of the main mechanisms for 331 inhibiting IFN-I signaling during continuous infection [47]. However, questions that 332 whether DON exposure could facilitate down-regulation of IFN-I in PEDV-infected 333 cells remain unanswered. We investigated the effects of DON to IFN-I expression and 334 confirmed that low concentrations of DON facilitated PEDV to escape innate immune 335 by activating autophagy in IPEC-J2 cells. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING, 336 TMEM173, MITA) is a critical component of the cellular innate immune response to 17 337 pathogenic cytoplasmic DNA and expressed predominantly in the endoplasmic 338 reticulum (ER) [48]. It can be activated by the enzyme cGAMP synthase (cGAS) and 339 then activates interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and NF-\u03baB, which leads to the 340 induction of type I interferon and other immune response genes. We then investigated 341 the contribution of STING to autophagy-inhibited IFN expression for that attenuation 342 of the STING signaling can occur through autophagy [49] and confirmed that 343 autophagy-mediated STING pathway played a crucial role in the innate immune escape 344 of PEDV in IPEC-J2 cells treated with DON. 345 Current PEDV pathogenesis target primarily virus infection, little attention focus 346 on non-infectious factors. This study provides evidence for the first time that low 347 concentrations of DON can promote PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo, documenting 348 that autophagy activated by DON modulates the promotion. The present study also 349 provides new insight into developing potential novel antiviral strategies against PEDV 350 infection. 351 Materials and methods 352 Animal experiments.

Animal experiments were carried 356 out at a 1400-weaning piglets farm. Eighty weaning piglets (age 3 weeks) were selected.357 These piglets were positive for PEDV naturally and negative for transmissible 20 400 determined using the \u0394cycle threshold (\u0394C t ) method with GAPDH serving as a 401 reference gene.",

It is produced by Fusarium species and occurs frequently in cereals and 77 animal forages throughout the world, resulting in regular animals and human exposure 78 [11, 12]. Among the farm animals, pigs are the most sensitive species to DON. It has 94 In this study, we evaluated the effects of DON on PEDV infection in vitro and in 95 vivo and found that DON promotes autophagosomes formation, thereby facilitating 282 Thus, the co-existence of DON and PEDV occurs frequently in global pig farms. However, whether DON exposure may increase the susceptibility to PEDV remains 284 unknown. In this study, we provide the first strong evidence that DON exposure can 285 promote PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanism might be 289 Since the ability of DON to efficiently cross biological barriers, fast dividing cells such 290 as intestinal epithelial cells will be more susceptible to the detrimental effects of DON 291 [11, 34]. And PEDV mainly infects pig small intestinal epithelial cells. We then 292 hypothesized that some substances, such as DON, that lead to pig intestinal epithelial 293 cell stress might encourage the progress and spread of PED. Therefore, the intestinal 294 porcine epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 was used as an in vitro model of swine small 15 295 intestine epithelium. Experiments in vivo were performed on twenty-seven weaning 296 piglets received the basal diet containing DON. In the present study, we found, for the 297 first time, that low concentrations of DON could facilitate PEDV infection in vivo and 298 in vitro. What drives DON to promote virus infection? PEDV crosses the porcine intestinal 300 mucosa to cause intestinal infection, and then results in an acute viral enteric disease, 301 which means that PEDV must gain access to the tight junctions. As noted earlier, the 302 alteration of tight junction proteins distribution might participate in virus entry, for 303 example, occludin internalization contributes to PEDV entry [35]. In the experiments 304 reported here, we demonstrated that DON could aggravate occludin internalization in 305 PEDV-infected cells. When the occludin gene was silenced by siRNA, the promotion 306 of DON to PEDV entry in IPEC-J2 cells was disappeared simultaneously, indicating 307 that occludin internalization contributes to the DON-induced PEDV entry. And what 308 was responsible for occludin internalization was further confirmed. autophagy is often hijacked by viruses and manipulated to their own advantage [22]. Our data in this study have showed that the autophagy levels were significantly 318 increased by DON in vitro and in vivo, which are consistent with the viral infection 319 levels. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of the LC3B blocked the promotion of DON 320 to PEDV viral yield. Therefore, we concluded that autophagy is required for DON-",
