The purpose of this study is to define the speciation of fungal elements found in patients with accurately diagnosed CRS and to compare the flora distribution with patients with no sinus disease or complaints. Previous testing techniques using fungal cultures sample nonspecific areas in the nose from the nasal vestibule to the nasopharynx. To alleviate this source of uncertainty concerning quantity and location of sampling, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) method was used to process the specimens obtained from the middle meatus under endoscopic guidance for speciation. Our results are presented with analysis and statistical review.",

It is commonly quoted that sinusitis accounts for between 22 and 30 million patient visits per year.\n1\n A huge pharmaceutical industry exists to produce drugs that have an effect on sinus conditions with sales figures in the billions of dollars. Panels and cooperative groups have met to try to create a standardized terminology to define sinusitis. The disease is often conveniently broken down into \u201cacute sinusitis\u201d and \u201cchronic sinusitis\u201d based on the time course of existing symptoms despite treatment. Chronic rhinosinusitis is often defined as a disorder of the sinuses that has been present for 12 weeks and persists despite treatment. It is presumptive that acute or subacute rhinosinusitis clears within 3 months.\n2\n\n",

Yet, findings on radiologic studies are not specific as to the causation of disease.\n3\n In fact, a simple upper respiratory infection can produce CT findings indistinguishable from CRS on film review and yet be entirely reversible with either little or no directed treatment.\n4\n Perhaps the reason for this confusion is that the causation of rhinosinusitis itself is currently not properly defined. Although the model of a simple bacterial or viral infection is suitable for understanding acute rhinosinusitis, an all\u2010encompassing model of CRS clearly does not exist because this form of the disease presents with much greater variability. Chronic rhinosinusitis may or may not be accompanied by nasal polyposis, atopic allergy, fungal infection, chromosomal abnormality, immune dysfunction, or other metabolic dysfunction.",

It could be argued that the fungal laboratory culture technique leads to contamination and that this is why the yields approach 100% in some studies.

The culture method requires a week's worth of specialized laboratory processing and therefore results are not immediately available. In addition, to reveal the specific identification of the fungi found, QPCR methods may be necessary to finalize the specific genus and species of the growing fungal colonies. QPCR techniques are extraordinarily accurate because the identification is based on specific DNA coding. Therefore, accurate identification is essentially instantaneous. QPCR also avoids prolonged laboratory culturing and has the potential to reveal a quick result. Also, it does not appear that directed culture techniques can duplicate the yields found in irrigation methods of sampling as evidenced by our results. In fact, the directed culture techniques seem to have a yield lower than the QPCR\u2010based methods that show a yield of approximately 40% to 60%.\n13\n, \n14\n, \n22\n, \n28\n It is possible that the irrigation techniques are too indiscriminate to provide accurate information on the mycology of the middle meatus or of a specific nasal region.",

The results are generally similar to other investigations in that a vast variety of organisms was identified. This vast and variable flora precluded identifying a statistically significant culprit or group of culprits underlying rhinosinusitis in the diseased population. Other studies have revealed a predominance of Aspergillus species\n25\n, \n30\n or a general trend toward identifying Penicillium species.\n12\n Others have found Alternaria, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Cladosporium species that seem to predominate.\n10\n This study showed a predominance of Cladosporium species from specific middle meatus sampling. Other fungi, including Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Epicoccum, and Stachybotrys, were also identified frequently. It is interesting that Alternaria species were not identified in this study because it is a prominent finding in other studies.\n10\n, \n30\n No conclusions can be drawn from this flora distribution, but this study does reveal the mycology of a specific region of the nose in that the specimens were directly sampled from the middle meatus.",

In this study, 82 molds were screened using QPCR, but only 15 molds were identified and of these 15 molds, only 13 are part of group I or group II. Although not statistically proven, a trend observed in this study was a relation of the presence of group II molds in patients with sinus disease.
