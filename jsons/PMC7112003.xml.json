            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs), within the family of Coronaviridae in the Nidovirales order, are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. These viruses can be further classified into four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus (de Groot et al., 2013). CoVs exhibit a propensity for interspecies transmission and pose a severe threat to the global public health, leading to enormous socioeconomic disruptions each year. Currently, six known CoVs can infect humans, including the alphaCoVs hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E and the betaCoVs HCoV-OC43, HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (Bermingham et al., 2012; Li et al., 2007; Vabret et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2014b; Weinstein, 2004; Woo et al., 2005). As the notorious examples of CoVs crossing species barriers, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are both zoonotic pathogens originating from animals. Studies have shown that the two viruses have experienced similar cross-species transmission routes such that they \u201cjumped\u201d from their natural hosts first to an intermediate adaptive animal and then to humans (Lu et al., 2015). Such interspecies transmission events are largely unpredictable and therefore could have severe public health consequences. In 2002\u20132003, SARS-CoV first emerged in China and swiftly spread to other parts of the world, leading to more than 8000 infection cases with a fatality rate of \u223c10% (Weinstein, 2004). A decade later, MERS-CoV was discovered in the Middle East and has thus far spread to over 27 countries, causing a total of 2298 laboratory-confirmed infections and 811 associated deaths as of 30th January 2019 (WHO, 2019). These continuously occurring yet unpredictable events of betaCoVs repeatedly crossing species barriers have caused special attention to focusing on betaCoVs. Dissecting the interspecies transmission potentials for other, especially the newfound, members of the genus has become an active area of CoV research.",

            "text": "Phylogenetically, betaCoVs can be categorized into four (A, B, C and D) evolutionary lineages. The human infective betaCoVs of HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 are grouped into lineage A, while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to lineages B and C, respectively (Forni et al., 2017; Su et al., 2016). In 2013, a novel member of lineage A betaCoVs, the dromedary camel coronavirus UAE-HKU23 (DcCoV UAE-HKU23), was initially identified through genomic sequencing in fecal samples from dromedaries in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (Woo et al., 2014). Subsequently, the live DcCoV UAE-HKU23 virus was successfully isolated from the human-derived cell line of HRT-18G (human rectal tumor epithelial) cells (Woo et al., 2016), suggesting that DcCoV UAE-HKU23 has evolved to recognize unknown human receptor/(s) and gained the capacity to infect human cells. It is well known that MERS-CoV is probably originated in bats and transmitted to humans using dromedaries as an intermediate host (Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2014). In light of the fact that dromedaries can host both DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and MERS-CoV and that DcCoV UAE-HKU23 is able to infect human cells, it has raised the alert over a potential pandemic caused by the DcCoV UAE-HKU23 virus or its variants. In such a context, knowledge on the virus relevant to its interspecies-transmission potentials would be of vital importance in understanding the viral pathogenesis and in providing new opportunities for human intervention in potential infection cases.",

            "text": "Receptor recognition is a key factor determining the tissue tropism, host specificity, and interspecies-transmission of a virus. In CoVs, this process is mediated by the envelope-interspersed surface-located trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). In most cases of virus entry, coronaviral S needs to be further cleaved by host proteases into a S1 subunit which is responsible for receptor binding and a S2 subunit that functions to mediate membrane fusion (Lai et al., 2007). S1 sequences diverge across different genera but are relatively conserved within each genus. S1 contains two independent domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), either or both of which can function as a receptor-binding entity. For instance, the CTD of SARS-CoV, a typical lineage B betaCoV member, could recognize a proteinaceous receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003). MERS-CoV and HKU4, both belonging to lineage C, use their CTDs to engage dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also called CD26) for receptor binding (Lu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014a). In lineage A, mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) uses its NTD to recognize the proteinaceous receptor of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), whereas bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and HCoV-OC43 utilize their NTDs to interact with the sugar moiety of 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) to facilitate virus entry (Peng et al., 2011, 2012). It is notable that the sugar-binding capacity of a CoV seems relevant to the presence or absence of a functional hemagglutinin esterase (HE) protein which harbors the receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) activity. Both HCoV-OC43 and BCoV encode a functional HE which is believed to destroy the sugar receptors late in the infection cycle, thereby enabling viral detachment from sugars on infected and/or nonpermissive host cells (Desforges et al., 2013; Zeng et al., 2008). For most CoVs, however, they do not encode functional HEs and have evolved to either reserve very-weak sugar-binding capacity (such as in MERS-CoV (Li et al., 2017)) or completely lose its sugar-binding activity (such as in MHV (Peng et al., 2011)) in their spikes. An HE gene was identified in the genome of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 (Woo et al., 2014). In addition, the spike NTD of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 (HKU23-NTD) shows a high sequence identity to that of BCoV, a prototypic sugar-binding CoV. These bioinformatic analyses are highly indicative of a similar sugar-engagement capability for the DcCoV UAE-HKU23 virus. However, any functional and structural characterization on HKU23-NTD has been lacking thus far.",

Subsequently, the protein was first harvested from the insect cell culture medium via affinity chromatography and then purified to homogeneity via gel filtration. Its well-behavior of being eluted as a symmetric peak on a gel filtration column revealed good biochemical characteristics of the purified protein. The SDS-PAGE analyses further demonstrated its high purity (Fig. 1B).",

To this end, the GST protein (used as an irrelevant protein control) and NTD proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (SARS-NTD and MERS-NTD) were included in the assay in parallel with HKU23-NTD (Fig. 1C). As expected, GST did not bind to mucin. In addition, neither SARS-NTD nor MERS-NTD interacted with mucin which falls in good accordance with previous reports (Li et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2011). In such a context, intimate and concentration-dependent interactions with the bovine submaxillary gland mucin (BSM) was observed for HKU23-NTD (Fig. 1D). The result therefore provided solid evidence that HKU23-NTD possesses the sugar-binding capability, suggesting sugars may be an attachment receptor determinant for DcCoV UAE-HKU23 virus infection.",

Previous mutagenesis studies in BCoV-NTD have revealed a critical sugar-engagement tetra-residue motif (TRM) composed of Y162, E182, W184 and H185(Peng et al., 2012). These four amino acids belong to the top ceiling region, sterically locating in the disulfide-locked ceiling element constituted by two \u03b2-strands (\u03b26\u2032 and \u03b27\u2032) and one helix (\u03b12), as well as their flanking loops. This ceiling element bent over the upper \u03b2-layer of the sandwich core to form, together with the upper layer strands \u03b27 - \u03b29, an extended pocket (designated as pocket A) where sugars are proposed to bind (Fig. 3\nA). In addition, a second sugar-binding pocket (denoted pocket B) was recently identified in the top ceiling region of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV)-NTD (PDB code: 6QFY) (Hulswit et al., 2019) and HCoV-OC43-NTD (PDB code: 6OHW) (Alejandra Tortorici et al., 2019). Key sugar engagement residues in the pocket, including K81, T/S83 and W90, reside in the inter-strand \u03b23/\u03b24 element. Two small \u03b2-strands (\u03b22\u2032 and \u03b23\u2032) and one helix (\u03b11) are observed to form in the element. They are further lined on one side by an N-terminal element, forming a pocket of smaller size (Fig. 3B and C). Sterically, pockets A and B are in proximity to each other. In addition, the N-terminal element of pocket B is further linked to the disulfide-locked ceiling element of pocket A via a disulfide bond (Fig. 3A\u2013C).",

Accordingly, HKU23-NTD folds to build two quite resembled pockets and contains conserved critical residues with similar conformations and steric positions within the pockets (Fig. 3D). To verify the key functions of these amino acids in the sugar engagement by HKU23-NTD, residues E182, W184, H185 in pocket A and K81, T83, W90 in pocket B are mutated either individually or in combination. We then performed the mucin-binding assay using these mutant proteins by ELISA. As expected, residue substitutions in both pockets dramatically jeopardized the sugar binding capacity of the protein. While single mutants of E182A, W184A and H185A in pocket A showed significantly decreased sugar binding, the substitutions in pocket B (W90A, K81A+T83A double mutant, as well as the triple mutant) all led to a complete loss in sugar recognition (Fig. 3I).",

MHV- and HKU1-NTD, however, possess a pocket A of smaller size due to the shortened upper-layer strands and exhibit variant conformations for the equivalent residues within pocket B (Fig. 3E\u2013F). For SARS- and MERS-NTD, owing to variant ceiling-element structures, both pockets are of quite different compositions and conformations from those in HKU23-NTD (Fig. 3G\u2013H). Accordingly, no or only marginal sugar-binding activities are reported for these viral NTD proteins (Hulswit et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017; Ou et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2011). Taken together, we believe that the DcCoV UAE-HKU23 virus, with two conserved sugar-binding pockets in its spike NTD, shares the same sugar-recognition mechanism as BCoV, PHEV and HCoV-OC43. A more refined sugar-binding basis for HKU23-NTD, however, still awaits a complex structure of atomic resolution. Despite of intensified co-crystallization screenings, we have not been able to obtain the protein crystals of HKU23-NTD bound with any sugar molecules thus far.",

It is notable that with a conserved sandwich core, these ceiling and lateral components could be conceived as topological insertions between equivalent core-strands. In lineage A, six NTDs show a similar N-terminal component constituted by the \u03b21\u2032 strand. With the exception of HKU1-NTD, the other five lineage A NTDs contain the same \u03b23/\u03b24 insertion with two \u03b2-strands (\u03b22\u2032 and \u03b23\u2032) and one \u03b1-helix (\u03b11). For the \u03b28/\u03b29 insertion, however, it is composed of a single loop in HKU1-NTD, but of a single \u03b2-strand (\u03b24\u2032) in MHV-NTD, and of two \u03b2-strands (\u03b26\u2032 and \u03b27\u2032) and one \u03b1-helix (\u03b12) in HKU23-, BCoV-, PHEV- and HCoV-OC43-NTD. For the NTD \u03b213/\u03b214 insertion, DcCoV UAE-HKU23, BCoV, PHEV and HCoV-OC43 all contain a single \u03b2-strand (\u03b28\u2032), whereas HKU1 contains a single \u03b1-helix (\u03b12). MHV, however, possesses both \u03b2-strand (\u03b25\u2032) and \u03b1-helix (\u03b13). On the lateral side, instead of forming an inter-layer \u03b2-hairpin between \u03b25 and \u03b26 as observed in other five NTDs, MHV-NTD forms a lateral \u03b1-helix (\u03b12) for this insertion (Fig. 4A\u2013F). In lineage B, the core-strand insertions in SARS-NTD are predominated by four \u03b2-strands. These include two (\u03b22\u2032 and \u03b23\u2032) in the \u03b28/\u03b29 inter-linker, one (\u03b21\u2032) in the \u03b23/\u03b24 linker and one (\u03b24\u2032) in the \u03b213/\u03b214 linker, respectively. No lateral components, however, are observed in SARS-NTD (Fig. 4G). In lineage C, MERS-NTD is of the most complexity in terms of its strand-insertion composition, containing in total twelve \u03b2-strands and five \u03b1-helices (Fig. 4H). The N-terminal component comprises \u03b21\u2032 and \u03b11. While both the \u03b23/\u03b24 and \u03b213/\u03b214 insertions are composed of two \u03b2-strands and one \u03b1-helix (\u03b22\u2032, \u03b23\u2032 and \u03b12 for the \u03b23/\u03b24 insertion, and \u03b211\u2032, \u03b212\u2032and \u03b15 for the \u03b213/\u03b214 insertion), the \u03b28/\u03b29 insertion includes three \u03b2-strands (\u03b28\u2032 - \u03b210\u2032) and two \u03b1-helices (\u03b13 and \u03b14). Finally on the lateral side, two \u03b2-hairpins (\u03b24\u2032/\u03b25\u2032 and \u03b26\u2032/\u03b27\u2032) are observed to be topologically inserted between core-strands \u03b25/\u03b26 and \u03b26/\u03b27, respectively, assembling as a \u201cdouble-arm\u201d to embrace the other insertions (Fig. 4H).",

In the most cases of CoV infection, the CTD of the S1 subunit is prior over the NTD to function as the receptor-binding entity, whereas the NTD can sometimes facilitate CoV entry via binding to sugars, such as observed in the lineage A members of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 (Alejandra Tortorici et al., 2019; Hulswit et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2011, 2012). In this study, we demonstrated that DcCoV UAE-HKU23, which is a newfound member of lineage A betaCoV, can also recognize sugars via its S protein NTD. Furthermore, we also solved the crystal structure of HKU23-NTD and showed that it exhibits a resembled overall fold to other lineage A betaCoV NTDs. Guided by the previous studies characterizing the sugar-engagement sites in betaCoV NTDs (Hulswit et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2012), we successfully allocated two conserved sugar-binding pockets in the HKU23-NTD structure. Further mutagenesis study verified that both pockets play a role in the sugar recognition by the viral protein. With these experimental data, we believe DcCoV UAE-HKU23 utilizes the same mechanism to interact with sugars as other sugar-binding betaCoVs (e.g. BCoV and HCoV-OC43).",

Their steric adjacency might lead to allosteric interactions between the two pockets, explaining our observations that residue-substitutions in either pockets could affect the mucin-engagement by HKU23-NTD. It is also notable that amino acid mutations in pocket A only decreased the sugar interactions of HKU23-NTD, but residue mutations in pocket B could completely abolish the binding. Similar results have also been observed in HCoV-OC43-NTD (Hulswit et al., 2019). We therefore believe that pocket B likely plays a more dominant role than pocket A in sugar recognition. We also noticed that a recent study (Alejandra Tortorici et al., 2019) reported a cryo-EM structure of HCoV-OC43 spike in complex with 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia), in which the 9-O-Ac-Sia moiety binds to pocket B in the spike NTD. In comparison to pocket B, pocket A is apparently of different residue-compositions and of larger size. This raises the possibility that pocket A has evolved to accommodate different sugar types (rather than 9-O-Ac-Sia) with relative lower-affinities than that observed between pocket B and 9-O-Ac-Sia.",

            "text": "It is also interesting that comparison of currently available betaCoV NTD structures reveals a conserved \u03b2-sandwich core. The top-ceiling and the lateral-side components, which are of variant compositions and folds, can thereby be dissected into element insertions between equivalent core-strands. In all the eight structures, the top-ceiling is composed of four insertions, including an N-terminal element and the \u03b23/\u03b24, \u03b28/\u03b29 and \u03b213/\u03b214 insertions. The number and composition of the lateral components, however, varies among different lineages. In lineage C, the MERS-NTD structure shows two lateral elements, one being inserted between strands \u03b25 and \u03b26 and the other one inserted between \u03b26 and \u03b27 (Fig. 5\n). In lineage A, all the six structures reveal a single lateral component, topologically forming the \u03b25/\u03b26 insertion. In comparison to that in lineage C, however, this \u03b25/\u03b26 insertion is of smaller size due to shortened amino acid sequence in the region (Fig. 5). In lineage B as observed with SARS-NTD, its structure is devoid of any lateral elements (Fig. 5). Finally in lineage D for which no NTD structure is available to date, the NTD sequence of bat coronavirus HKU9 clearly shows a single \u03b25/\u03b26 insertion as observed in lineage A. Nevertheless, this insertion is apparently of longer length (Fig. 5), drawing parallels between lineage C and lineage D viruses but differing HKU9 from members in lineage A. This is likely a unique feature for lineage D betaCoV NTDs. Taken together, we therefore believe that the lateral components of betaCoV NTD exhibit lineage-specific characteristics. While showing a conserved sandwich core of similar fold and of the same topological structure, the structural comparison also highlights that the betaCoV NTDs likely evolve from a common ancestor, which experiences divergent evolutions to form different lineages.",

A previously described GP67 signal peptide sequence (Han et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2013) was added to the protein N-terminus for protein secretion, and a 6 \u00d7 His tag was added to the C-terminus to facilitate further purification processes. The protein was expressed and purified as described previously for other betaCoV NTDs (Peng et al., 2011, 2012; Yuan et al., 2017). Briefly, HKU23-NTD protein was prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). The sequencing-verified recombinant pFastBac1 plasmid was transformed into DH10Bac competent cells to get the recombinant Bacmid, which was then transfected into Sf9 cells to get the primary baculovirus stock. Sf9 cells were then used to amplify the baculoviruses to obtain high-titer viral stocks, and High5 cells were used to express the protein. The supernatant of High5 culture was collected 72 h post-infection and passed through a 5 ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). The proteins bound to HisTrap were then detached by elution with gradient concentrations of imidazole. Subsequently, the target protein was further purified in an AKTA Pure System by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in the buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl. Finally, the eluted protein is pooled, analyzed for its purity by SDS-PAGE, and preserved for sugar-binding assays and crystallization.",
