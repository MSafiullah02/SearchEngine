However, extrapulmonary manifestations are not uncommon. Skin rash [4] , petechial cutaneous bleeding with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and increased d-dimer [12] , impaired liver function, subclinical left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [13] , and rhabdomyolysis [14] were occasionally reported. One of the more common presentations other than respiratory symptoms is diarrhea [4, 7, 9, [15] [16] [17] [18] . Our previous report that 170% of patients in the Amoy Garden cohort developed diarrhea showed that fecal excretion may be an important mode of shedding and transmission [7] . Subsequent epidemiological investigation confirmed the im- portance of faulty sewage systems in propagating this massive outbreak of disease. Retrospective virological examination of stool samples by RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the virus in 190% of the samples obtained between day 14 and 21 after onset of symptoms, which is almost twice the positivity rate of the corresponding nasopharyngeal samples [8] . It is therefore interesting to examine the role of SARS coronavirus in the pathogenesis of diarrhea in patients with SARS. Diarrhea is not an uncommon symptom during hospitalization for patients with infectious diseases other than acute gastroenteritis. In fact, diarrhea has been well reported in pneumonic illnesses other than SARS, such as legionnaires disease [19] , Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [20] , and influenza (especially in children) [21] . Moreover, diarrhea is not uncommon in association with many systemic infections. For example, the rate of diarrhea was reported to be 34.5% among children with primary dengue fever [22] . The exact mechanisms leading to diarrhea in these systemic or pulmonary infections were not known, but they could be related to the cytokine profiles or metabolic changes associated with sepsis. In addition to primary viral illness, other potential causes of diarrhea include the use of drugs during hospitalization and C. difficile superinfection, because most patients with SARS have been empirically treated with antibiotics that cover typical and atypical pneumonia. Finally, diarrhea can be the direct result of viral cytolysis, because the virus can grow and produce a cytopathic effect in a large intestinal cell line, CACO-2 [23] . A study of the correlation between the clinical parameters, microbiological findings, and outcomes for patients with SARS with and without diarrhea may differentiate the relative importance of the suggested causative factors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 147, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 254, "end": 258, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 337, "end": 341, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 363, "end": 367, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 477, "end": 480, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 481, "end": 483, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 484, "end": 486, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 487, "end": 491, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 492, "end": 496, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 497, "end": 501, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 502, "end": 506, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 678, "end": 681, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1095, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1462, "end": 1466, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1500, "end": 1504, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1550, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1738, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2374, "end": 2378, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In this cohort of 142 patients with SARS, only 10.6% of the patients had diarrhea at hospital admission. During hospitalization, 69 (48.6%) of the patients had developed diarrhea at a mean time of days after the onset of symptoms. 7.6 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 2.6 The most severe diarrhea occurred 1-2 days after the onset of diarrhea, with a maximum frequency of 24 episodes per day. In 6 patients, diarrhea was so severe that intravenous fluid hydration was warranted. The diarrhea was relatively painless and watery, as we have reported previously [7] . No correlation was found between diarrhea and hematological changes, radiological changes, use of antibacterials, or isolation of C. difficile and rotavirus from stool specimens. The only significant correlation was that there was a higher virus load in the nasopharyngeal specimens taken from patients with diarrhea on day 10 after the onset of symptoms. The finding that a higher virus load-but not the presence of diarrhea-predicted mortality in this group of patients is not unexpected. In 2 previous studies of animal models of SARS [6, 24] , histological changes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and inflammation-characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (disruption of alveolar walls and infiltration with neutrophils and macrophages), alveolar hyaline membrane formation, as well as multinucleated syncytial cells-were found in a macaque monkey model artificially inoculated with SARS coronavirus [6] . None of the monkeys developed diarrhea over a period of 16 days, despite the fact that RT-PCR results were positive for SARS coronavirus in 1 of the stool samples. Similarly, no histopathological changes could be detected in the intestines of the monkeys, despite there being concomitant florid pathological changes in the lungs [6] . These findings suggest that viral rep-lication triggers a different response and thus different functional impairment in the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. A high virus load in the nasopharynx specimens either may predict severe pneumonia, ARDS, and mortality in some patients, or it may predict just diarrhea in other patients. This postulation is in keeping with the lack of significant difference in hematological markers of inflammation or increased cell turnover (lactate dehydrogenase level) between the groups with or without diarrhea. Although suppression of inflammatory changes in the intestine resulting from steroid therapy is possible, the routine use of steroids and ribavirin as part of the treatment protocol did not allow us to control the effect of use of steroids or antivirals on diarrhea. Moreover, the use of steroids has not affected the severe inflammatory reactions in the lungs of persons who have died of SARS [25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 530, "end": 533, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1077, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1081, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1456, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1788, "end": 1791, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2738, "end": 2742, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In our previous study, we showed that rotavirus can be detected by viral isolation in cell culture and by indirect immunofluorescent antigen detection [10] .

Others reported that respiratory symptoms were found in 93% of patients with gastroenteritis caused by enteric adenovirus [28] . This virus has been found in samples from the upper respiratory tract and in stool samples obtained from these patients [29] . Similar to rotavirus and adenovirus, the SARS coronavirus can multiply and shed in the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract. In this regard, determination of the virus load in specimens from the nasopharynx may be useful for predicting the severity of illness in both the respiratory and the gastrointestinal tracts. From the laboratory perspective, RT-PCR is more likely to be affected by the abundant inhibitors present in stool than by nasopharyngeal secretions. Moreover, the volume of diarrhea varies markedly from patient to patient. This may also affect the interpretation of data on the virus load in stool.

Recombinants of group 1 had enteric and respiratory tropism, whereas group 2 recombinants infected the respiratory but not the enteric tract. A substitution in amino acid 219 of the S protein in group 1 recombinant was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism [47] .
