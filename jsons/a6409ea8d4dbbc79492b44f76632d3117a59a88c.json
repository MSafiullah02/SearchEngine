She took part in capturing, drawing blood from, and skinning these animals. She did not use contact precautions consistently and did not use airborne precautions. Her team entered a large, hollow tree ( Fig. 1.1 ) that housed insecteating bats. In the cavity of the tree, she collected bats and bat droppings. Her team also placed traps for fruit-eating bats, and she drew their blood without the use of gloves. She did not skin any fruit-eating bats. Bat genera that she encountered on the trip included Hipposideros, Epomops, and Epomophorus.",

On interviewing the patient, we provided her with a case series of biology students who entered into a bat-infested hollow tree in Uganda and who developed histoplasmosis [1] . The patient recognized the tree pictured in a figure in the manuscript and stated that it was the same tree that her team had entered. Further laboratory work-up included an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), sputum culture for acid fast bacteria, fungal sputum culture, Histoplasma urine antigen, Histoplasma serum antibody, and Blastomyces serum antibody. Results from further work-up are shown in Table 1 .3. The Histoplasma urine antigen was positive, confirming the diagnosis of histoplasmosis.",

            "text": "This patient had a large number of exposures during her travels, but initially the most worrying among them was the patient's dissection without wearing gloves of fruit-eating bats, specifically the genus Epomops. The Epomops fruit-eating bat has tested positive for Ebola virus IgG and is considered a potential reservoir of Ebola virus [2, 3] . Furthermore, Ebola outbreaks were previously reported in Uganda in 2000 and 2007 [4, 5] . Ebola was not a likely diagnosis, however, given that our patient and her fellow team members did not display any of the typical signs and symptoms of a hemorrhagic fever syndrome. Her case was part of a larger outbreak initially suspected to be tuberculosis because of dyspnea and a miliary pattern on CXR. However, arguing against this diagnosis was the lack of known specific exposures to tuberculosis. Instead, with the common exposure of ill travelers within the bat-infested hollow tree, the outbreak was most consistent with histoplasmosis. This was particularly suggested by the typical pulmonary findings and the incubation period. The initial symptoms of headache, fever, chills, and malaise (initially empirically diagnosed as leptospirosis) most likely represented the initial symptoms of histoplasmosis after exposure inside the hollow tree. Our patient first developed symptoms 4 weeks prior to presentation, when the Histoplasma serology test was positive only at the lower limit of positivity, while subsequent serologic testing revealed high-level positivity, confirming the diagnosis. The patient's symptoms resolved completely with oral itraconazole therapy. This case demonstrates how an extensive history is vital in the returning traveler who has multiple high-risk exposures.",

Of note, there are two varieties of Histoplasma capsulatum pathogenic to humans, Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii (African histoplasmosis) and Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum (classic histoplasmosis). African histoplasmosis is a rare, deep mycosis that usually occurs in the tropical belt of Africa and can involve the skin, subcutaneous tissues, lymph nodes, and bones [7] . It rarely affects the lungs and is rarely reported outside of Africa. Classic histoplasmosis is found worldwide, including Africa, and can cause pulmonary infection or disseminated infections.",
