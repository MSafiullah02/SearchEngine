A 95% confidence interval for the presence of binomially distributed variables (eg, the prevalence of loss of smell) was calculated using Wilson\u2019s method. Correlation was performed using Spearman\u2019s method. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with experiencing OD. In the multivariable analysis, significant predictors were identified via backward elimination, using a P value cutoff of 0.100. The final multivariable results were cross-validated by bootstrapping the data over 100 iterations. For each variable retained in the final model, a P value and a log-odds ratio were calculated.",

In our cohort of 103 COVID-19\u2013positive patients, the prevalence of OD (hyposmia or anosmia) was 61.2% and the mean onset was 3.4 days after symptoms of COVID-19 first appeared. OD occurred on the first day of COVID-19 symptoms in 8.7% of participants and was the only symptom on the first day of symptoms in 2.9%. When it occurred during COVID-19, OD was severe in nature and was strongly correlated with a concomitant loss of taste. In contrast to prior studies reporting low prevalence of nasal symptoms, 30% to 50% of our participants experienced nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, which they attributed to COVID-19. However, there was no correlation between these symptoms and OD. Of all patients\u2019 characteristics as well as characteristics of the patients\u2019 COVID-19 course, only older age was negatively associated with having OD and female sex was possibly positively associated with having OD. Interestingly, patients with OD experienced generally more severe SOB compared to patients not experiencing OD.",

Consistent with prior findings, we observed that OD is highly prevalent in COVID-19 and frequently occurs concomitant to loss of sense of taste. We extended these findings by also showing that the severity of OD is generally quite severe, and its severity is correlated with the severity of loss of sense of taste experienced by patients. In our cohort, although the occurrence of OD as the first symptom was lower than previous reports by Lechien et al11 and Kaye et al,12 our results were consistent with theirs in finding that OD is generally an early symptom of COVID-19. We also extended these findings by specifically showing the time distribution of incidence of OD in COVID-19. In our cohort, OD occurred with a mean 3.4 days (median 3 days) into the COVID-19 course and it almost always occurred before day 8 of the disease course. We also show for the first time that 30% to 50% of patients attributed symptoms of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea to COVID-19 but that these symptoms did not correlate with OD. Classic COVID-19 symptoms of fever and cough did not correlate with OD either, although patients with OD did have more severe SOB when compared to those without OD. Finally, we identify age and sex as risk factors for OD, with younger age and female sex being associated with OD.",

Our cohort size consisted of only 103 patients, and all were from 1 region of Switzerland. We also acknowledge that our study design relied heavily on adequate patient recall and report. However, previous studies of recall bias suggest that recall of disease-specific manifestations (such as symptoms), in particular those related to noteworthy events (such as COVID-19), is generally reliable, in particular for short periods (such as less than a month as we do here).31 We also studied subjective reports of OD due to present logistical constraints related to meeting with infected patients to apply objective olfactory testing. Finally, most of these patients had been experiencing symptoms for less than 2 weeks and are thus likely still in the midst of the infection. For this reason, we did not study resolution of OD, and we also acknowledge that OD could continue to evolve in those patients. Thus, it is possible, for example, that our estimates for the prevalence and timing of OD may be underestimated, respectively, compared to if queried in patients who had completely resolved infections.",
