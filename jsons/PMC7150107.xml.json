In its natural host, HSV-1 and 2 cause only mild facial lesions, including gingivostomatitis or keratitis, or lead to clinically inapparent infections. There is lifelong infection with Herpes simplex virus because of viral latency in sensory neurons. Only in neonates or immunocompromised individuals, fatal encephalitis or systemic disease can occur. When immunity is compromised by stress or disease, the virus becomes activated by suppression of the latency-associated transcript gene. At this stage, the virus can be shed even in the absence of visible lesions. Oral, conjunctival infection and meningoencephalitis are most commonly caused by HSV-1, whereas genital and neonatal infection is usually attributed to HSV-2 infection. Primates are susceptible to both serotypes. Transmission occurs from humans to monkeys and vice versa, leading to epizootics with high morbidity and mortality in common marmosets. There is no evidence for the presence of HSV-1,2 genotypes exhibiting a higher virulence for animals [2]. Spontaneous HSV-1 infections are described in wild marmosets (black tufted-ear marmosets, Callithrix penicillata) in a natural park in Brazil [3], [4], in young pet marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) in private husbandries [5], [6], [7], [8], and in a semifree-living common marmoset colony in Germany [9]. Most reported cases of herpesvirus infection in callitrichids occurred in animals kept privately, often in close association with the family.",

            "text": "\nPathology. Usually, infection leads to a severe, rapidly progressing and often fatal generalized febrile disease with typical lesions on oral mucous membranes [1], [7]. Clinical symptoms depend on the extent and severity of gross alterations. Infected animals show severe apathy, anorexia, weakness, and marked salivation or serous nasal discharge before they become moribund and die [9]. Death occurs within 2\u201314 days after the onset of the first symptoms. In rare cases, infected animals survive and develop a persistent infection, which can be monitored by serologic examination [5]. Gross pathology is characterized by erosions and ulcers of variable extent on oral or genital mucous membranes and mucocutaneous junctions of the lips, which may become confluent and are covered by a fibrinonecrotic exudate (Fig. 15.1\n). The lesions are accompanied by severe lymphadenopathy of regional lymph nodes. Areas of necrosis and hemorrhage may be present in other organ systems if the disease disseminates. In severe cases, the cerebral cortex may also be involved [5], [7]. Histopathologic changes consist of severe vesiculation and ulceration of squamous epithelia of mucous membranes and tongue with acantholysis, parakeratosis, coagulation necrosis, and polykaryocytosis. Necrotic foci may extend from the submucosa to the surface epithelium (Fig. 15.2A\n). Epithelial cells at the ulcer margins show varying degrees of degeneration and necrosis. Typical intranuclear inclusion bodies are key morphologic features of HSV infection. They are commonly found in epithelial cells at the borders of vesicles and ulcers. These intranuclear inclusions are surrounded by a clear halo and appear red-blue in Feulgen-stained sections. The presence of HSV antigen can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry using commercial antibodies against Herpes simplex antigen. Nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis is a frequent finding in HSV-infected callitrichids [5] (Fig. 15.2B). In cases with meningoencephalitis, intranuclear inclusion bodies can be found within neurons and glial cells. The widespread distribution of the virus within neurons and glia cells can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 15.2C). Using transmission electron microscopy, large numbers of enveloped virions can usually be detected in the cytoplasm and within intercellular spaces (Fig. 15.2D). Intranuclear particles measure 80\u2013100 nm, the enveloped extranuclear particles have an outside diameter of 150 mm or more. Similar gross and histologic lesions are observed in experimentally infected marmosets [10].",

More than 50 distinct simian lymphocryptoviruses have been isolated [14]. All lymphocryptoviruses are closely related to Human herpesvirus 4, the Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV). EBV infects B lymphocytes and is indigenous to humans. Infected humans develop lifelong latent infections and most cases remain asymptomatic. Under certain conditions, the virus can cause infectious mononucleosis. Furthermore, there is an association between infection and tumor development. In this context, EBV is involved in the pathogenesis of Burkitt's lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, as well as in oral hairy leukoplacia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in immunocompromised patients. In general, infection is not associated with disease in the natural host. Immunosuppression of latently infected individuals or infection of nonnatural hosts may lead to rapid lymphoproliferation or lymphomatous disease. Spontaneous disease attributed to EBV infection in common marmosets is not reported, but the demonstration of serum antibodies against EBV indicates that marmosets are susceptible hosts. Experimental EBV infection of common marmosets leads to seroconversion, but there is no definite evidence of lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma [15].",

Histologically, lymph node architecture is completely obliterated by sheets of infiltrating heterogeneous neoplastic round cells identified as B lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry. Small amounts of reactive T lymphocytes are scattered among neoplastic cells. Similar infiltrates can be found in the colonic mucosa, infiltrating and expanding the lamina propria and less frequently the submucosa, muscularis, and serosa. The mucosa of the small intestine may be similarly altered (Fig. 15.3\n). Neoplastic cellular infiltrates may also occur in liver, kidney, and lung [22].

A generalized infection with severe often fatal clinical disease can occur in immunodeficient individuals or highly susceptible species. It seems that cowpox infections occur as sporadic outbreaks depending on environmental viral burden and the pathogenetic potential of the virus. In common marmosets, natural and experimental infection leads to severe vesicular, hemorrhagic dermal lesions, preferentially in the facial skin (Fig. 15.5A\n), scrotum/labia, and palmar or plantar surfaces. For modeling orthopoxvirus infection, a New World monkey-adapted cowpox virus named calpox virus is used, which was isolated during a natural disease outbreak [42]. Experimentally induced disease is similar to the natural infection [43].",

Common marmosets experimentally infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) develop a disease similar to humans and represent a useful animal model for these highly pathogenic coronavirus species. Intratracheal inoculation of marmosets with SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) is associated with mild clinical disease, including an increase in rectal temperature, watery diarrhea, and dyspnea at 4 and 7 days after infection. Grossly, multifocal areas of pulmonary atelectasis and consolidation as well as tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy may be noted. The predominant histological lesion is a multifocal to coalescing interstitial pneumonia with multinucleated syncytial cells, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, edema, and lymphocytic bronchiolitis. Tracheobronchial lymph nodes show parafollicular lymphocytic hyperplasia and histiocytosis within the subcapsular sinuses. Extrapulmonary findings include lymphocytic hepatitis with single cell necrosis, mild diffuse colitis, and mild multifocal lymphocytic myocarditis [53], [54], [55]. Common marmosets inoculated with a MERS-CoV strain (HCoV-EMC/2012) develop moderate to severe signs of respiratory disease, including increased respiratory rates, open-mouth breathing, anorexia, decreased levels of activity, and the presence of oral frothy hemorrhagic discharge. A transient decrease in body temperature may also be noted. Radiographic imaging of the lungs shows mild-to-severe bilateral interstitial infiltration. Major gross lesions are multifocal consolidation and dark red discoloration of the lungs. Microscopically, the lungs show multifocal to coalescing, moderate-to-severe acute bronchointerstitial pneumonia, coupled with type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and consolidation of pulmonary fibrin [56], [57]. Coronavirus-like particles have been detected by electron microscopy in feces of common marmosets and seem to be related to enterocolitis. Particles are characterized by regularly spaced petal-shaped projections from the surface and measure between 100 and 220 nm [58].",

Usually, HAV antigen is not detectable in other organs, indicating that the liver is the only and primary site of virus replication. Shedding of HAV in feces during the late incubation period can be explained by excretion of HAV from the liver with the bile [81]. The end of the incubation period is indicated by an initial increase in serum liver enzymes. Characteristic histopathologic changes such as activation of sinusoidal cells, piecemeal necrosis, and bridging necrosis as well as periportal and parenchymal mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration are detectable during the acute phase, coinciding with a maximum of transaminase levels and the appearance of anti-HAV antibodies [79]. At the same time, clusters of solid or empty virus-like particles about 27 nm in diameter can be demonstrated by electron microscopy mainly in membrane-bound cytoplasmic vesicles of Kupffer cells and hepatocytes [82]. In the convalescent phase, regeneration of hepatic tissue starts and the transaminase values return to baseline. HAV is a potentially zoonotic agent; monkeys can become infected with human strains, but infection is usually self-limiting. Chronic infections and carrier stages are not described.",

HCV is a member of the genus Hepacivirus within the family Flaviviridae. HCV is not associated with natural disease in nonhuman primates, and experimental infection of several nonhuman primate species failed. Only chimpanzees are susceptible and represent an important animal model for chronic hepatitis. In contrast, GB agent viruses are frequently found in a number of New World monkeys; GBV-A and variants are enzootic viral infections of several NWP species including common marmosets, whereas GBV-B and GBV-C are blood-borne pathogens of man and chimpanzees. GB agent viruses are closely related to HCV of humans. They are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the same genus and family as HCV. Several GBV-A variants seem to circulate in wild populations of New World monkeys. No clinical disease is associated with GBV-A and C infection, and diagnosis is confirmed using RT-PCR performed on plasma or serum. In contrast, GBV B can induce an acute hepatitis when inoculated intravenously into several species of New World primates. Common marmosets are susceptible to experimental GBV-B infection and develop a characteristic acute nonsuppurative hepatitis, which is characterized by an infiltration of lymphocytes, mainly CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD20+ B lymphocytes, within the first 2 months of primary infection [85]. Experimental GBV-B infection of marmosets can be used as a surrogate model of HCV infection for investigation of pathogenetic pathways and antiviral drug development [86].",

Yellow fever induced by the yellow fever virus (YFV), another flavivirus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, is a devastating viral infection of free-living New World monkeys. The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Aedes and Haemagogus, which serve as vectors. YFV is endemic in South America, and the disease naturally occurs among wild marmosets and tamarins [87]. Devastating outbreaks are reported among howler monkeys. They frequently coincide with human cases in the geographic vicinity [88], [89]. Suspected epizootics among common marmosets in endemic areas could not be confirmed [90]. Experimentally infected callitrichids rapidly succumb to disease, and death occurs within 1 week after infection. Gross lesions are not specific except for fever and jaundice, which are infrequently observed. Histologically, liver lesions are described, including hepatocellular necrosis, fatty change, and hemorrhage. Acidophilic apoptotic (Councilman) bodies are rarely observed [91], [92]. As the disease is primarily a problem of wild living primates, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of hemorrhagic fever occurring in endemic regions or in recently imported monkeys originating from endemic areas. Experimental infection has shown that common marmosets are highly susceptible for other RNA viruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae, Arenaviridae, and Filoviridae families, all inducing hemorrhagic fevers. Common marmosets are used as animal models for Lassa fever induced by Arenaviridae, Argentine hemorrhagic fever induced by Junin virus, and filovirus hemorrhagic fever induced by Ebola and Marburg virus [53].",
