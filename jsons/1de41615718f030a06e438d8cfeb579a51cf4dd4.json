            "text": "We simulate the evolution of eccentric binary systems in the frame of the grazing envelope evolution (GEE) channel for the formation of Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb), and find that extra mass removal by jets increases the parameter space for the formation of SNe IIb in this channel. To explore the role of eccentricity and the extra mass removal by jets in the GEE we use the stellar evolutionary code MESA binary. The initial primary and secondary masses are M 1,i = 15M and M 2,i = 2.5M , respectively. We examine initial semi-major axes of 600 \u2212 1000R , and eccentricities in the range of e = 0 to e = 0.9. Both Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) and mass removal by jets, followed by a wind from the SN IIb progenitor, leave a hydrogen mass in the exploding star of M H,f \u2248 0.05M . This is compatible with a SN IIb progenitor. We find that in many cases, with and without the extra mass removal by jets, the system can enter a common envelope evolution (CEE) phase, and then gets out from it. Despite the large uncertainties, extra mass removal by jets substantially increases the likelihood of the system to get out from a CEE. This strengthens earlier conclusions for circular orbits. In some cases RLOF alone, without mass removal by jets, can form SN IIb progenitors. We estimate that the extra mass removal by jets in the GEE channel increases the number of progenitors relative to that by RLOF alone by about a factor of two.",

The compact progenitors have small hydrogen mass, M H 0.15M , at explosion, while the red supergiant progenitors have M H 0.15M at explosion. Mass transfer, both stable and unstable, followed by winds that are efficient in removing most of the remaining hydrogen can form compact SN IIb progenitors (e.g., Yoon et al. 2017; Gilkis et al. 2019) . Winds in higher metallicity populations are more efficient in removing mass, therefore leading to a higher ratio of SNe Ib to SNe IIb.",

Other studies examine the general population of SNe IIb (e.g., Stancliffe & Eldridge 2009; Claeys et al. 2011; Ouchi & Maeda 2017) , concluding also that to account for a large fraction of SNe IIb the binary system progenitors should lose mass more efficiently than what traditional binary evolution predict. Sravan et al. (2018) consider Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) mass transfer in their study of SN IIb progenitors, and conclude from their population synthesis study that the binary channel and the single stellar channel have about equal contribution to SNe IIb (also Sravan 2016) .

Soker (2017) proposes that in some cases the extra mass removal that some studies require to form SNe IIb (e.g., Claeys et al. 2011; Ouchi & Maeda 2017) can result from jets that the companion to the exploding star launches. The binary companion launches the jets as it grazes the envelope of the more massive progenitor of the SN IIb. The jets remove mass efficiently from the envelope, and by that postpone or prevent the onset of a CEE; instead, the binary system experiences the grazing envelope evolution (GEE; Soker 2015). Naiman et al. (2020) study the GEE channel for circular binary orbits with the binary module of the mesa code (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics; Paxton et al. 2011 Paxton et al. , 2019 by mimicking the extra mass loss due to jets with a simple numerical prescription. The GEE channel forms mainly bluecompact SN IIb progenitors, because post-GEE winds remove most, but not always all, of the remaining hydrogen.",

Other free parameters include the form of equation (3) and the parameter f jet there, the parameter f GEE in equation 2, the parameters of the RLOF (section 2.1), and the fraction of mass that each star loses during the jets activity episodes (in this study each star loses half of the mass; section 2.2).",

In some simulations, with and without jets, according to mesa binary the binary system gets into a CEE phase, and then out (Naiman et al. 2020 , and in section 3). However, this evolutionary track of in-and-out of the CEE is highly uncertain. Without jets, we expect that in a circular orbit when the secondary enters the giant envelope it will continue to spiral-in. In orbits with high eccentricity the secondary might get out without jets. Jets might ease the exit from a CEE, and the system continues with the GEE. Again, these transitions from the GEE to the CEE and back, are highly uncertain.",

Specifically, in equation (2) we turn the jets on according to the ratio of the periastron distance to the primary radius. If the condition holds, jets are active along the entire orbit. We do not follow the orbital separation along the orbit. Such a more accurate treatment requires a different and a much more extended study that will introduce more free parameters. In any case, we do not think this is a major limitation because the RLOF mass transfer scheme in mesa binary takes eccentricity into account when averaging the mass transfer over one orbit. Because our mass removal by jets scheme is proportional to the RLOF mass transfer rate (equation 3), we also take this into account. We also found that when we start with e i 0.8 the eccentricities at late times might become close to 1, when we cannot trust the evolutionary scheme for our purposes.",

In this case, jets activity does take place, during the time period marked by the teal vertical band in the upper left panel. The primary reaches CCSN with a hydrogen mass of M H,f = 0.055M , hence a SN IIb. Without the enhanced mass loss rate due to jets activity, the system enters a CEE and does not get out from it. It does not form a SN IIb progenitor by this channel. This is a clear case where the GEE increases the parameter space for the formation of SN IIb progenitors. In Fig. 4 we present the HR diagram of the primary star in the case with jet activity (left panels of Fig. 3) . In Table 1 we list simulations with other eccentricities, which we list in the first column, keeping all other initial parameters as in the other simulations of this section, i.e., a 0 = 1000R , M 1,i = 15M , M 2,i = 2.5M , and f GEE = 1.1. In the second column we indicate whether we allow ('On') or not ('Off') jets activity. The third column of Table 1 lists the duration of the CEE, \u2206t CEE , where 'Continues' implies that the system continues with the CEE and does not get out from it, and 'No' indicates that no CEE occurred. The fourth column lists the final hydrogen mass in the primary star. Table 1 shows that for a given initial semi-major axis, the probability of experiencing a CEE increases with increasing eccentricity. This is an expected result, as periastron distances are smaller for higher eccentricities. For e i 0.4 and the other parameters we use here, jets activity (the GEE) might play an important role. For other parameters jets might play an important role even from e i = 0 (Naiman et al. 2020) . In some of the cases Figure 1 , but for an initial eccentricity of ei = 0.1 rather than for a circular orbit, and with the presentation of two more parameters. The dashed-doted purple lines in the upper panels depict the evolution of the eccentricity, with scale on the right axis. The dashed-black line in the upper panel is the periastron distance (1 \u2212 e)a. The five time periods span, from left to right, 1.213 \u00d7 10 7 yr (earliest time segment), 7200 yr, 353 yr, 2447 yr, and 9.259 \u00d7 10 5 yr (last time segment). In contrast with the circular orbit, here even without jets activity the system avoids the CEE, and the jets never turned on. Therefore, the panels on both sides of the figure are identical.",

By RLOF and the action of jets the secondary star removes a large fraction of the primary's envelope. Winds then remove more mass, leaving a small final hydrogen mass (Tables 1 , 2 ). There is a class of low mass post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that have a main sequence companion at a semi-major axis of \u2248 1 AU, and which typically have eccentric orbits (e.g., Kastner et al. 2010; Van Winckel 2017a) . In a large fraction of these the main sequence companion launches jets (e.g., Thomas et al. 2013; Van Winckel 2017b; Bollen et al. 2019 ). These post-AGB binary systems suggest that in most cases binary systems that experience the GEE end with eccentric orbits. This motivated us to extend an earlier study of the GEE scenario for SNe IIb (Naiman et al. 2020) to include eccentric orbits.",

The first four columns give some initial settings, while the fifth column indicates whether we allow for jets activity (the GEE; 'On') or not ('Off'; see also explanation to Table 1 in the main text). The sixth column lists the duration of the CEE if occurs, or indicates if no CEE occur ('No') or whether the system does not get out from the CEE and the secondary continues to spiral-in ('Continues'). The last column lists the final hydrogen mass in the primary star. If the system enters a CEE and does not get out, we terminate the evolution and cannot give the hydrogen mass at CCSN. We also terminate evolution when the eccentricity becomes too large, e > 0.99, or e > 0.9999.
