Other viruses were only sporadically present (Fig. 4) . The results also confirm the frequent presence of influenza and influenza-like viruses in children aged 0-14 years. In addition, in the youngest age-group of 0-4 years, the presence of also virus type B was confirmed, which shows that young children have a poorly developed immune system, making them more vulnerable to disease. Large gatherings of people contribute to influenza infections. Children due to daily stays in kindergartens and schools are particularly susceptible to infection and also are carriers of infection (Hallmann-Szeli\u0144ska et al. 2015 . The RSV virus is a leading cause of respiratory tract infections in infants. This infection usually runs a mild course in older children and adults, but is severe in infants who often require hospitalization (Brydak 2008) . Due to an extremely low percentage of vaccinated children, the number of cases of influenza steadily increases from season to season. This widely spreading tendency could be overcome through the implementation of vaccination against influenza from the sixth month of age, which is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (CDC 2016) and by other associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP 2016). Unfortunately, few parents undertake a decision to vaccinate their children, which in case of infection may end up with lifethreatening complications. The same holds true for vaccination of pregnant women, which actually provides immunization for both mother and child. A confirmed case of influenza in a 14-day old child we observed in the present study pointedly shows that the mother was not vaccinated during pregnancy, although such vaccinations are recommended in Poland in the Preventive Vaccination Plan.",
