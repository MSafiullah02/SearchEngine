Among pathogens of ARTI, HPIVs are secondary only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [Weinberg, 2006] . Four types of HPIVs have been identified. Studies of HPIVs have focused primarily on HPIV1, 2, and 3; HPIV-4 has not attracted sufficient clinical attention due to the fact that the illness caused by it is minor [Aguilar et al., 2000; Templeton et al., 2005; Vachon et al., 2006] . Recent studies indicate that HPIV-4 is associated with respiratory infections including bronchitis and pneumonia [Rubin et al., 1993; Lindquist et al., 1997; Lau et al., 2005 Lau et al., , 2009 Vachon et al., 2006; ] . Furthermore, it was found that this virus had an outbreak in a small range and that children under 2 years of age may encounter serious acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) [Lau et al., 2005; Weinberg, 2006; Wang et al., 2012] .

No child 6 months of age or less was found to have HPIV-1, and only four patients 6-12 months of age were found to have HPIV-2. The detection rate of HPIV-3 was highest in children less than 1 year of age. Compared to HPIV types 1-3, HPIV-4 was detected at a higher rate in patients 36 months of age. Further statistical analysis suggested that only for HPIV-3 was the difference in the detection rate between ages statistically significant (x 2 \u00bc 29.648, P \u00bc 0.000) ( Table I ). The seasonal distribution of HPIVs fluctuated, and a phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure 1 .

Phylogenetic analysis of partial p gene sequences of 28 human parainfluenza virus strains from NPA specimens. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 3.1. Viral sequences in marks were generated from the present study; other reference sequences were obtained from GenBank. viruses. Hong Kong's Lau et al. [2009] found that the most common symptoms in HPIV infections included cough, running nose, fever, and wheezing, and that some patients exhibited vomiting, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. In the past, HPIV4 was known to cause mild disease and therefore did not attract sufficient attention. However, in recent years, HPIV4 was found to have caused a localized outbreak of pneumonia, bronchiolitis and aseptic meningitis [Vachon et al., 2006; El Feghaly et al., 2010] . This study showed that all patients found with HPIVs had the most common symptoms of HPIV infection, for example, cough, fever, and wheezing. Some patients presented with vomiting and diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms; while others with HPIV-3 and HPIV-4 exhibited polypnea and cyanosis. In most children, rales were heard in lung examination. In terms of clinical diagnosis, bronchial pneumonia was the most common finding. The evidence shows that HPIV was also an important pathogen for children with acute lower respiratory tract infection.",

This study also compared the clinical manifestations between HPIV-3 and HPIV-4 monoinfection and co-infection groups. There was no difference between the two groups in gender, seasonality, mixed infection, fever, wheezing, polypnea, cyanosis or diarrhea. Due to the low number of HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 cases, we did not compare their clinical manifestations in the study.",

Our study also confirmed that HPIVs are very important pathogens in children with ALRTIs in China as a whole.
