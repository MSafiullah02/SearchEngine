            "text": "To date, vaccination remains the most effective way for control and prevention of infectious diseases. The majority of vaccines currently available are based on inactivated or live attenuated pathogens. Although these vaccines are highly effective, and for smallpox in humans and rinderpest in cattle have even led to the eradication of target pathogens, they often induce side effects at some frequency in populations [1], dictating the need for the development of safer vaccines. Over recent years, advances in recombinant DNA technologies and genetic engineering have led to the development of subunit vaccines (SUVs) [2]. SUVs are based on specific components of pathogens, often located on their surface. Therefore, SUVs are considered safer than full pathogen-based inactivated or live attenuated vaccines. However, immunogenicity of SUVs is generally low compared to that of full pathogen-based inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, thus requiring higher doses, booster administrations and co-administration of adjuvants, or developing alternative approaches for enhancing target-specific immunity. Virus-like particles (VLPs) represent a major advancement in the development of SUVs with enhanced immunogenicity. VLPs are formed by structural viral proteins which have an inherent property for self-assembly, and mimic the morphology of the pathogen. In contrast to live viruses, VLPs are non-infective and non-replicating, since they are essentially devoid of infectious genetic material. VLPs display antigenic epitopes in the correct conformation and in a highly repetitive manner, leading to cross-linking of B cell immunoglobulin receptors and B cell activation [3], [4]. As exogenous antigens, VLPs are efficiently taken up by professional antigen presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells (DCs), followed by antigen processing and presentation by MHC class II molecules, DC activation and maturation through up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine production, and stimulation of CD4+ T helper cells, leading to the induction of strong humoral and cellular immune responses [3], [4], [5]. Similar to native viruses, VLPs are processed in the cytosol of DCs and are presented by MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells by the cross-presentation mechanism, inducing potent cytotoxic immune responses [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].",

Additionally, a number of VLP-based vaccine candidates, including GSK's anti-malaria vaccine RTS,S, are in clinical development [14], while many others, targeting pathogens such as influenza virus, rotavirus (RV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are undergoing pre-clinical evaluation [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. To date, VLPs, non-enveloped and enveloped, have been produced for a number of targets using mammalian [21], plant [22], insect [23], yeast [14] or bacterial cells [24], and cell-free platforms [25], [26]. Additionally, vaccine antigens can be produced as genetic fusions or chemical conjugates to viral structural proteins, resulting in chimeric VLPs. Key aspects of licensed or advanced stage VLP vaccines are presented in Table 1\n.",

HBsAg tends to assemble into water-soluble micelles [46], [50], [51] in association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) originated lipids [52]. Using recombinant DNA technology, HBsAg has been successfully produced in yeast [53], [54], [55] and mammalian cell [56] expression systems, resulting in VLPs similar to the 22-nm highly immunogenic HBsAg subviral particles isolated from the plasma of individuals chronically infected with HBV [57], [58]. These recombinant HBsAg VLPs varied in molecular weight, size, monomer composition, glycosylation and immunogenicity [59], [60] as well as in the site of assembly [61], [62] (for more details, see Sections 3.2, 3.4).",

For example, an anti-malaria vaccine, RTS,S, is based on a malaria antigen expressed as a fusion partner on the surface of VLPs containing HBsAg [63]. During the last two decades, coat proteins (CPs) of several plant viruses have been successfully engineered to produce target antigens from a range of mammalian pathogens. For example, chimeric particles formed by CPs of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) fused to Plasmodium falciparum epitopes [64]; alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) presenting rabies virus, HIV-1 [65], [66] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [67], [68] epitopes; cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) displaying epitopes of HIV-1 [69], HPV16 [70], Bacillus anthracis\n[71] and P. falciparum\n[72]; and potato virus X (PVX) carrying epitopes of HIV-1 [73] and influenza virus [74] have been shown to stimulate target-specific immune responses.",

Enveloped VLPs provide a higher degree of flexibility for integration of more antigens from the same or heterologous pathogens [19], [85], [86], [87]. The most prominent examples of enveloped VLPs are VLPs engineered to express vaccine target antigens from influenza viruses [88], [89], retroviruses [81], [90] and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [91]. Production of enveloped VLPs requires co-expression of several structural viral proteins, their assembly into particles, incorporation into host membranes and release of particles (budding) from the cell membrane. For example, a successful assembly and budding of influenza A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) VLPs have been achieved by co-expressing four structural proteins (hemagglutinin [HA], neuraminidase [NA], matrix protein M1 and ion channel protein M2) of the virus. The resulting VLPs, produced in insect cells, closely resembled native influenza virus particles by size and morphology, with the same fine structure of surface spikes [89]. Expression of M1 protein alone, but not HA, NA or nucleocapsid protein (NP), results in the formation and release of particles [89]. In other studies, using both baculovirus- and vaccinia virus-based expression systems, influenza VLPs containing HA, NA and M1 [92], HA and M1 [93], or M1 only [94] have been produced, supporting the key role for M1 protein in the enveloped VLP formation and release. In contrast, a more recent study by Chen et al., using plasmid DNA-transfected mammalian cells, demonstrated assembly and budding of influenza VLPs comprising HA and NA only [88].",

Furthermore, expression in insect cells of HCV core protein, envelope proteins E1 and E2, and p7 protein has been shown to result in the formation and release of enveloped VLPs of 40\u201360 nm in diameter, presumably derived from the ER [91]. The morphology, immunoreactivity and biophysical characteristics of HCV VLPs were similar to those of putative HCV virions isolated from HCV-infected humans.

There are reports on the efficient assembly and release from insect cells of human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV)-like particles. While expression of M and E proteins is sufficient for smooth-surfaced VLP assembly [96], [97], high-level accumulation of co-expressed S, E and M proteins of SARS-CoV from a single baculovirus vector results in a very efficient formation of VLPs that morphologically mimic native SARS-CoV virions [97]. Also, VP40 matrix protein of Ebola virus has been shown to form VLPs when produced in mammalian cells [98] and could be a potential vaccine for preventing infections with Ebola virus. Inclusion of other Ebola virus proteins such as NP, GP and VP35 enhances the VP40-based VLP formation approximately 40-fold [99] without any major changes in VLP morphology [100]. Another example of enveloped VLPs are VLPs against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) consisting of HA-NA (HN), fusion (F), NP and M proteins of the virus. These VLPs, produced in avian cells, structurally and functionally resemble NDV virions, preserve biological activity of the VLP-associated NDV glycoproteins, and are released with an efficiency of 84%, which allows for preparing large quantities of the particles needed for vaccine manufacturing [101], [102]. More recent studies have demonstrated the utility of plants as another alternative for producing VLP-based vaccines against animal pathogens [22].",

Mice immunized with these bivalent chimeric VLPs generated high-titer anti-pre-S1 antibody responses and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses specific to both targets. VLPs were also generated following expression of truncated version of HCV core antigen (HCcAg), consisting of the N-terminal 120 amino acids, in E. coli with an average diameter of 30 nm [108]. Similarly, HCV E2 epitope fused to the C-terminus of papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) CP, following expression in E. coli, assembled into chimeric PapMV VLPs [109], [110]. In another study, PapMV CP was used to produce chimeric VLPs displaying lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) immunodominant CTL p33 epitope [111]. The chimeric PapMV-HCV VLP-vaccinated mice developed long-lasting (more than 120 days) epitope-specific antibody responses [109], while the PapMV-LCMV VLPs induced maturation of dendritic cells which efficiently processed and cross-presented p33 epitope to CTLs in vitro and in vivo, and protected immunized mice against LCMV challenge [111].",

The vaccine (MalariVax) has been shown to elicit anti-CSP antibodies in mice and monkeys and CSP-specific CD4+ T cell responses in mice [112], [113]. The vaccine was well tolerated by humans, and generated CSP-specific antibodies and cellular immune responses in vaccinees in Phase 1 clinical trials when administered in the presence of different adjuvants (Table 2\n) [24], [114]. This strategy was also employed by Sanofi Pasteur (Lyon, France) for developing a universal influenza vaccine based on M2e, a highly conserved epitope in both human and avian influenza A viruses, displayed on the surface of HBcAg VLPs. Animals immunized, parenterally or intranasally (IN), with these chimeric M2e VLPs were protected against lethal challenge with various influenza A virus subtypes, and protection was enhanced by the use of adjuvants, which correlated with higher anti-M2e antibody responses. The immunogenicity of the HBcAg VLP-based M2e vaccine was confirmed in a Phase 1 clinical trial (Table 2) [115].",

For example, Cytos Biotechnology AG (Zurich-Schlieren, Switzerland) has developed a number of VLP vaccine candidates based on RNA bacteriophage Q\u03b2. These chimeric VLP vaccines target self-antigens and are directed against non-infectious diseases such as allergies, neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's disease) and autoimmune disorders (type II diabetes mellitus), cancer (melanoma) and hypertension, and nicotine (Table 2). The candidate vaccine against Alzheimer's disease (CAD-106) was designed to present chemically coupled A\u03b21-6 peptide derived from the N-terminal B cell epitope of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) protein, the main component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, on the surface of VLPs formed by Q\u03b2 CP. The vaccine has been shown to induce A\u03b2-specific IgG antibodies and reduce amyloid accumulation in transgenic mice and in rhesus monkeys expressing A\u03b2 precursor protein, without stimulating T cells and causing microhaemorrhages or inflammatory reactions in amyloid-containing brain tissue [116]. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, CAD-106 was well tolerated and did not induce meningoencephalitis. CAD-106 vaccinated patients developed substantial titers of anti-A\u03b2 IgG antibodies but exhibited no difference compared with placebo in cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b2 levels or whole brain volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging [117]. Phase 2 clinical trials of CAD-106 are ongoing (Table 2). Another VLP vaccine candidate, directed against hypertension, represents an angiotensin II-derived peptide conjugated to Q\u03b2 CP VLPs. The chimeric VLPs elicited angiotensin-specific antibodies and reduced blood pressure in hypertensive rats [118]. In a Phase 2a study in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, the vaccine, when administered subcutaneously (SC) in a conventional regimen with injections at weeks 0, 4 and 12, was found to be well tolerated and significantly reduce blood pressure during the daytime, especially in the morning, compared with placebo [119]. This vaccine was further evaluated in two independent trials using an alternative regimen (injections at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6 and 10) in an attempt to elicit higher antibody titers leading to the stronger reduction of blood pressure [120]. Although vaccine elicited higher antibody titers compared to the first study, due to low affinity of these antibodies the extent of decrease in blood pressure was not significant compared to placebo. Thus, a higher dose of vaccine (2.7 mg vs. 1.5 mg) was not found to be more efficacious.",

Two Merck and Co., Inc.\u2019s licensed VLP-based vaccines, Recombivax HB\u00ae and Gardasil\u00ae, have been manufactured using this system. Despite the successes, the system has some limitations. It differs from mammalian cells in the PTM of proteins, particularly in protein glycosylation [125], [126]. Due to this and some other limitations, the system is generally used for the production of non-enveloped VLPs. Nevertheless, production of enveloped HIV-1 Pr55Gag VLPs in yeast, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae spheroplasts, has been achieved. The released spherical VLPs were encapsulated with the yeast cell plasma membrane and morphologically resembled immature HIV particles [127]. The yeast-derived HIV VLPs were efficiently taken up by DCs in vitro via both macropinocytosis and endocytosis mediated by mannose-recognizing receptors but not the mannose receptor, inducing DC maturation and secretion of IL-12 (p70). DC maturation was also enhanced by yeast membrane components, likely via Toll-like receptor 2 signaling, contributing to stimulation of Gag-specific immune responses. Furthermore, DCs loaded with yeast-derived HIV VLPs have been shown to convert Gag-specific memory CD8+ T cells into effector cells in chronically HIV-infected individuals via cross-presentation, although some Gag-specific T cell populations in these patients remained unresponsive [128]. An alternative HIV-1 VLP vaccine candidate has been produced in yeast as a chimeric non-enveloped VLP by fusing HIV-1 p17 and p24 proteins to p1 protein of S. cerevisiae retrotransposon Ty [129]. The resulting HIV-1 p17/p24:Ty chimeric VLPs elicited HIV-specific serum antibodies in rabbits [129] and were immunogenic when evaluated in prophylactic clinical studies [130], [131], but were not effective as a therapeutic vaccine (Table 2) [132].",

HPV L1 VLPs have been shown to be immunogenic in mice [135] and also to induce both systemic and mucosal neutralizing antibodies as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses in vaccinated non-human primates [136], [141]. Furthermore, in a proof-of-principle study, cottontail rabbit papillomavirus L1 VLPs produced in S. cerevisiae successfully protected animals from virus-induced papilloma formation [142]. The first licensed HPV vaccine approved by the U.S. FDA, Gardasil\u00ae (Merck, USA), is a quadrivalent vaccine containing L1 VLPs from HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 produced in S. cerevisiae and administered intramuscularly (IM) in three doses with aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulphate as an adjuvant (Table 2) [13]. Several randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials evaluating Gardasil\u00ae have demonstrated safety, strong immunogenicity and excellent prophylactic efficacy against persistent HPV infection and genital diseases associated with the four types of HPV present in the vaccine in young uninfected women [143], [144], [145], [146], [147], [148], [149].",

HBsAg has been expressed in P. pastoris, S. cerevisiae and Hansenula polymorpha\n[53], [54], [55], [152], [153], [154], [155]. Although high-level retention and accumulation of HBsAg in the ER have been documented, neither secretion of the protein nor intracellular VLP formation were observed, suggesting that VLP assembly took place during downstream processing of yeast biomass [62]. A number of hepatitis B vaccines licensed worldwide are based on HBsAg S protein-formed VLPs expressed in yeast, including the U.S. FDA-approved Engerix-B\u00ae (GSK, Belgium) [10] and Recombivax HB\u00ae (Merck, USA) [12], both manufactured in S. cerevisiae, that generate potent protective anti-hepatitis B antibody responses (Table 2). Another HBsAg VLP-based vaccine candidate, malaria CSP antigen fused to HBsAg, is undergoing clinical development. GSK (Rixensart, Belgium), along with the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, manufactured a malaria VLP vaccine candidate, RTS,S, by producing a mixture of native HBsAg and chimeric HBsAg, containing a 200-amino acid fragment of CSP, in S. cerevisiae. Clinical efficacy of the adjuvanted RTS,S vaccine \u2013 from protection against experimental challenge with P. falciparum sporozoites in healthy adults to protection against clinical and severe malaria in young children \u2013 has been demonstrated in several trials (Table 2) [14], [63].",

            "text": "Additionally, the ability of Gag protein to serve as an antigen carrier has been utilized for the construction of various chimeric VLPs expressing antigens fused to non-structural HIV Env with the aim to broaden immune responses. Chimeric Gag VLPs that have been produced using baculovirus vectors contain HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein [168] or its CD4-binding domain [169]; gp120, Nef and Pol [85]; reverse transcriptase (RT), Tat and Nef [86], [170]; or gp140 or gp41 proteins [87]. Furthermore, co-expression of furin along with SIV Pr56Gag resulted in the incorporation of gp120 and gp41, the cleavage products of Env gp160, into assembled VLPs [90]. With the fused antigens, the employment of the chimeric VLP approach broadened the breadth and magnitude of immune responses. Chimeric HIV Pr55Gag VLPs carrying either the whole gp120 protein or its CD4-binding domain (the third variable domain [V3]), in the absence of adjuvants, have been shown to raise a strong antibody response against Pr55Gag, a neutralizing antibody response against gp120 and a potent CTL response against a gp120 epitope located in the V3 domain in mice [168], [169]. Immunization of rhesus macaques with chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) VLPs containing SIV Pr56Gag and HIV-1 gp120 proteins generated gp120-specific neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses and resulted in accelerated viral clearance in monkeys infected with SHIV-4 compared with non-vaccinated controls [171]. HIV-2 Pr54Gag VLPs carrying the V3 region of HIV-1 gp120 induced both anti-gp120 antibodies with neutralizing activity in rabbits and a strong gp120 epitope-specific CTL response [172]. DNA priming followed by boosting with chimeric HIV-1 VLPs expressing RT, Tat and Nef induced strong, broad Gag- and RT-specific cellular immune responses in mice that were two- to three-fold greater than after two administrations of DNA vaccine and stimulated both antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in contrast to non-chimeric HIV-1 Gag VLPs that induced predominantly robust Gag-specific CD4+ T cell responses [86], [170]. VLPs expressing HIV Env gp140 or gp41 glycoproteins with the native trimeric conformation elicited neutralizing antibody responses, and combining these sera had a synergistic effect on the neutralization of HIV pseudoviruses [87].",

The activity of CD40L-displaying HIV-1 VLPs was monitored by recording an increase in IL-12 cytokine production by DCs in vitro and enhanced levels of both humoral and cellular immune responses against HIV-1 p24 protein in immunized mice, an effect not observed in immunized CD40-knockout mice [16]. In another study, chimeric SIV VLPs containing Gag, Env and membrane-anchored granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have been generated and used to immunize mice. They significantly enhanced the production of SIV Env-specific antibodies with neutralizing activity and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, by comparison with non-chimeric SIV VLPs, SIV VLPs containing CD40L, non-chimeric SIV VLPs mixed with soluble GM-CSF, or non-chimeric SIV VLPs [173].",

Expression of HPV11 L1 or HPV16 L1 or L1 plus L2 proteins in baculovirus-infected Sf-9 insect cells has been demonstrated to result in the successful self-assembly of VLPs [174], [175] that elicited high titers of serum neutralizing antibodies in mice and rabbits following IM or SC immunization with no adjuvant present [174], [176]. Furthermore, HPV16 L1 VLPs have been shown to induce both systemic and cellular immunity in mice when administered IN or orally in the presence of cholera toxin or CpG, respectively, as mucosal adjuvants [177], [178]. Cervarix\u00ae manufactured by GSK (Belgium) [11] is a bivalent HPV L1 VLP-based vaccine against HPV types 16 and 18 produced in Trichoplusia ni (High Five\u2122) insect cells and approved by the U.S. FDA in 2009 (Table 2). Similar to the situation with Gardasil\u00ae, randomized clinical trials showed excellent prophylactic efficacy of Cervarix\u00ae in young women [179], [180], [181].",

The protection appears to be mediated by MHC class I-restricted CTLs, since it did not occur in \u03b22-microglobulin- or perforin-knockout mice [182]. In contrast to tumor protection observed in animal studies, only a trend to a histological improvement has been observed in HPV16-infected patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia who received SC chimeric HPV16 L1-E7 VLPs, although both humoral and cellular immune responses were induced [184]. In another approach, insertion of the cross-reactive epitopes from HPV16 L2 into L1 VLPs has been found to result in the induction of cross-neutralizing antibodies against other types of HPV in immunized rabbits [185], [186].",

The central role of VP2 in RV VLP assembly was further confirmed by expressing different combinations of VP proteins and characterizing the resultant VLPs [194]. In another study, double- and triple-layered VLPs were observed when VP2 was co-expressed with VP6 or with VP6 and VP7, respectively, with or without VP4 [79], [195], [196]. The triple-layered VLPs were morphologically similar to native RV virions, and the VP2/4/6/7 VLPs retained both neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes on VP4 and VP7 as well as hemagglutination activity [79].",

As described above in Section 2.2, A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) and A/Hong Kong/1073 (H9N2) VLPs based on the self-assembly of influenza M1 protein in different combinations with other influenza proteins (HA, NA and M2) have been produced in Sf-9 cells [89], [92], [93]. Subsequent studies reported the production of M1-based VLPs for other influenza strains, including A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2) [212], A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) [213], the highly pathogenic strains 1918 pandemic H1N1 [214] and avian influenza H5N1 [215], [216], and swine influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) [217], [218], [219]. In addition to the listed monovalent influenza VLP vaccines, bivalent VLPs have also been prepared by individually producing and admixing VLPs containing HA antigens from A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) influenza viruses [220], and trivalent VLPs have been produced by co-expressing three HA subtypes from H5N1, H7N2 and H2N2 or H1N1, H3N2 and type B influenza viruses [221], [222]. Furthermore, co-expression of a membrane-anchored form of flagellin, the Toll-like receptor 5 ligand, with M1 and HA from A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza resulted in assembly of VLPs containing an internal adjuvant component [223]. All of these insect cell-produced influenza VLPs have been shown to contain uncleaved HA molecules [82]. Binding of influenza VLPs to the cell membrane was shown to result in the VLP-cell fusion (at fusogenic pH) and VLP endocytosis mediated by interaction of HA and the cell sialylated receptor, contributing to VLP antigen presentation [224].",

IM or IN immunization with VLPs derived from influenza A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) elicited HA-specific serum antibody titers comparable to those induced by sublethal doses of live virus, and completely protected against lethal H3N2 influenza virus challenge [93]. VLPs derived from the avian A/Hong Kong/1073 (H9N2) strain given IM or SC to mice, rats and ferrets generated high antibody titers as detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay, and provided partial protection against H9N2 influenza virus challenge [92], [225]. IN immunization with VLPs based on the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza strain induced high serum and mucosal antibody titers, including neutralizing antibodies, against both homologous and heterologous viruses, and mice were protected against lethal challenge with either homologous or heterologous virus, even five months post-vaccination. Moreover, immune sera also conferred complete protection upon IN transfer. Protection was associated with suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine release [213]. Similar long-term protective immune responses in mice have been reported for H5N1 VLPs derived from A/Vietnam/1203/04 influenza virus [226]. These H5N1 VLPs and H1N1 VLPs derived from A/California/04/2009 influenza virus each elicited high HAI antibody titers and provided highly effective protection against lethal virus challenge in mice or ferrets after a single dose vaccination [218], [219], [227]. In blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2a and Phase 2 clinical trials, the unadjuvanted H5N1 (A/Indonesia/5/05) and H1N1 (A/California/04/2009) VLP influenza vaccine candidates, respectively, composed of HA, NA and M1 and manufactured by Novavax, Inc. (Rockville, MD), were found to be safe and well tolerated and to elicit robust HAI and neutralizing antibody responses in healthy adults (Table 2) [23], [228]. Notably, antibodies induced by H5N1 VLPs have been shown to cross-react with multiple clades of avian H5N1 influenza virus, which correlates with preferential antibody binding to influenza HA trimers [228].",

H5N1-pseudotyped VLPs induced strong cross-clade HAI antibody responses in mice and ferrets and conferred complete protection against homologous virus challenge.

Another VLP, a SIV-HA chimera, has been demonstrated to directly bind to B cells in vitro and stimulate their activation, proliferation, class switch recombination and somatic mutation [19]. Following IP mouse immunization, these VLPs induced germinal center formation, conventional B cell proliferation and preferential IgG2a antibody production, confirming results obtained in vitro.",

However, RSV-G VLPs were found to have greater efficacy than RSV-F VLPs. Another RSV vaccine candidate, manufactured by Novavax Inc. (Rockville, MD), represents nanoparticles composed of the near full-length RSV F protein expressed in insect cells and assembled in trimers [236]. In a Phase 1, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the RSV-F VLP vaccine candidate generated strong, dose-dependent RSV-F-specific and plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody responses that were augmented in the presence of adjuvant (aluminum phosphate) [237].",

Some VLP vaccine candidates, including bluetongue virus [273], bovine papillomavirus type 1 [274], chicken anemia virus [263], infectious bursal disease virus [268], porcine, mink and canine parvoviruses [39], [40], [41], and porcine encephalomyocarditis virus [275], have been evaluated in the natural target hosts and found to be protective against live virus challenge. The only approved veterinary VLP-based vaccine, Porcilis\u00ae PCV (Intervet International B.V., The Netherlands; currently Merck Animal Health), is composed of porcine circovirus type 2 Cap-2 antigen produced in baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells [276], [277], and shown to protect pigs against porcine circovirus type 2 infections [278], [279]. The vaccine has been on the market since 2009 [280].",

Due to the presence of broader-range HBsAg epitopes, these vaccines were believed to be more immunogenic and fast acting and to provide better protection compared with VLP vaccines containing HBsAg S protein alone [285], [286]. Two such vaccines, GenHevac B\u00ae and Sci-B-Vac\u00ae (formerly, Bio-Hep-B\u2122), developed in France and Israel, respectively, are on the market (Table 2). Hepacare\u00ae, another multi-antigen HBsAg VLP vaccine, indicated for immunization of non-immune adults of \u226518 years of age, was developed by Medeva Pharma Ltd (United Kingdom) and received marketing authorization in Europe, which was subsequently voluntarily withdrawn by the company for commercial reasons [287].",

Production of DENV VLPs resembling DENV virions by size and morphology has been achieved by co-expressing prM and E structural proteins in COS-1, CHO or 293T mammalian cell lines [288], [289], [290] and includes incorporation of the ER retention signal into the stem-transmembrane region of E protein [289], [291], [292]. However, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these VLPs were assessed by using DNA vaccines encoding the proteins [288]. A similar vaccination approach has been applied towards other flaviviruses including Murray Valley encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus [293], [294], [295], [296]. Subviral particles composed of prM and E proteins of Murray Valley encephalitis virus were able to protect vaccinated mice against lethal challenge with the virulent wild-type virus strain and protection correlated with the development of neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, cell-associated recombinant E protein neither protected mice nor induced neutralizing antibodies [297]. In a recent study, VLPs of four different DENV serotypes, DENV1-4, were evaluated as vaccine candidates in mice, and monovalent VLPs of each serotype stimulated specific IgG responses and potent neutralizing antibodies against homotypic virus, while tetravalent VLPs induced specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of DENV. In addition, both monovalent and tetravalent VLPs generated virus-specific CTL responses [290].",

VLPs targeting these viruses have been generated using the cDNA-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell expression system. Both types of VLPs comprised viral matrix VP40 protein or VP40 and an envelope glycoprotein, and closely resembled distinctively filamentous parental viral particles as shown by EM [298], [299], [300], [301], [302], [303]. VLPs targeting either Ebola or Marburg fever were highly immunogenic and protective against viral challenge in animal models. Ebola VLPs have been shown to activate mouse DCs in vitro and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as CD19+ B cells in vivo\n[302]. Vaccination of mice with VLPs targeting Ebola fever elicited high levels of Ebola virus-specific antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, and conferred complete protection against lethal Ebola virus challenge [302], [304]. Protection depended on activated natural killer cells [305] and required both humoral and CTL Ebola virus-specific responses [306]. VLPs targeting Marburg fever induced CD4+ T cell-dependent proliferative responses in vitro upon re-exposure to the homologous antigen, and in vaccinated guinea pigs elicited high titers of Marburg virus-specific antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, and conferred complete protection against lethal Marburg virus challenge [304]. Taken together, strong immunogenicity and protective capacities of Ebola and Marburg VLPs make them promising vaccine candidates for deadly filovirus infections.",

NiV VLPs formed by NiV G, F and M proteins were also produced in substantial quantities in cDNA-transfected HEK cells [315]. The assembled VLPs resembled parental NiV virions by size (40\u2013500 nm), morphology and surface composition as shown by transmission EM and cryoEM. NiV VLPs were fusogenic inducing syncytia formation, and activated innate immune defense mechanisms (NFKB2, TBK1, IL-8 and MAPK8 genes).

            "text": "An approach similar to that used for NDV-based NiV VLPs has been employed to produce a recombinant RSV VLP vaccine candidate. Specifically, RSV G and F proteins were fused to the TM and CT domains of NDV HN and F proteins, respectively, and chimeric VLPs were produced in cDNA-transfected ELL-0 cells [316], [317]. The resulting NDV/RSV chimeric VLPs have been shown to stimulate Th1-biased anti-RSV antibody responses in mice and confer protection against RSV challenge [316], [317]. Alternative RSV vaccine candidates have been produced by expressing full-length RSV F or G glycoprotein on live recombinant Sendai virus (SV) in vaccinia virus-infected mammalian cells, followed by propagating the recombinant virus in eggs. SV-RSV-G VLPs elicited RSV-specific antibody and conferred protection against RSV challenge following IN inoculation of cotton rats [318]. The preparation of a recombinant SV vaccine expressing RSV F protein has also been reported, and these chimeric particles elicited RSV-specific neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in cotton rats following IN immunization. Furthermore, the vaccine also conferred protection against challenge with RSVs, even those with a mismatched origin or sequence or of different subtypes [319]. Similarly, the SV platform has been used to produce vaccines against human parainfluenza viruses (hPIVs) by displaying F protein or hemagglutinin-neuraminidase of hPIV-2 or hPIV-3, and these recombinant SV particles generated long-lasting binding and neutralizing antibody responses as well as T cell responses, and protected against hPIV challenge [320], [321]. Two other groups have constructed RSV vaccines by displaying the soluble core domain of RSV G glycoprotein (amino acids 130\u2013230) on recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus (AdV) particles, or RSV G or F full-length proteins on defective non-propagating Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replicon particles, and produced the resulting chimeric particles in mammalian cells. A single IN immunization with either of these chimeric particles induced strong serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses in mice and cotton rats and provided long-term protection against RSV challenge [322], [323]. VEEV-based RSV vaccines also induced Th1/Th2-balanced T cell responses and were more protective when displaying RSV-F [322].",

These underscore the importance of rapid, large-scale development of vaccines against novel virus strains. Influenza VLPs have been generated in a mammalian system by co-expressing HA and NA proteins (with or without M1 protein) in plasmid-transfected HEK cells [88] and HA, NA, M1 and M2 proteins in transfected Vero cells [324]. H3N2 and H5N1 influenza VLPs produced in Vero cells resembled the parental influenza virions by particle size and morphology, as demonstrated by transmission EM and dynamic light scattering, and by the HA glycosylation pattern, as revealed by N-deglycosylation assays [324]. Vaccination of mice with H5N1 VLPs generated H5-specific IgG1 antibodies and HAI antibodies, and conferred full protection against lethal challenge with homologous virus. In addition to single pathogen target influenza VLPs, chimeric VLPs have been produced via pseudotyping of influenza viral proteins onto retroviral Gag VLPs. Thus, pseudotyped chimeric MLV Gag particles carrying HA (mostly cleaved into HA1 and HA2 products), NA and M2 from highly pathogenic A/Chicken/FPV/Rostock/1934 (H7N1) and A/Thailand/KAN-1/04 (H5N1) avian influenza strains have been produced in transiently co-transfected HEK cells [325]. Mice vaccinated with these VLPs developed a rapid and robust subtype-specific neutralizing antibody response even after a single immunization, with no cross-reactivity between H5 and H7, as determined by immune serum neutralization of VLP transduction titers [325]. However, neutralization of live H5N1 and H7N1 viruses using an HAI assay has not yet been reported.",

            "text": "In transiently transformed plants, HIV immunogenic epitopes have been expressed in the form of fusions to plant virus CP that formed non-enveloped chimeric VLPs. For example, a 22-amino acid long peptide from the gp41 envelope protein of HIV-1 strain IIIB (amino acids 731\u2013752), known to induce cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in HIV-infected humans [335], was inserted into the \u03b2B-\u03b2C loop of S protein of CPMV [69]. The resulting chimeric VLPs were demonstrated to induce gp41-specific neutralizing serum antibodies in mice following SC immunization in the presence of alum adjuvant [69]. In addition, mice vaccinated with these VLPs in the presence of cholera toxin mucosal adjuvant via IN (but not oral) administration developed both mucosal and systemic HIV-1-specific IgA and IgG2a antibody responses [336]. In another study, a highly conservative ELDKWA epitope from gp41 has been genetically fused to the N-terminus of PVX CP, and the purified chimeric VLPs induced high titers of neutralizing HIV-1-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in mice following IP or IN delivery [73]. Notably, the VLPs were also shown to stimulate human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hu-PBL) to produce antibodies against the gp41-derived epitope as shown by immunizing hu-PBL-reconstituted severe combined immunodeficient mice with VLP-pulsed autologous DCs. Sera from both normal and humanized mice possessed an anti-HIV-1 neutralizing activity. In another study, the V3 loop from HIV-1 gp120 protein has been fused to AlMV CP and cloned into a TMV-based vector. Inoculation of N. benthamiana with the infectious in vitro synthesized transcript resulted in accumulation of chimeric viral particles that were shown to elicit antigen-specific virus-neutralizing antibodies in IP immunized mice [65]. Similarly, chimeric AlMV CP VLPs have been engineered to express a 21-amino acid peptide representing amino acids 170\u2013190 of RSV G protein (VMR-RSV) in plants. These chimeric particles generated strong humoral and cellular immune responses in vitro, when used to pulse human DCs, as well as in vivo, when introduced into non-human primates [68]. In an earlier study, AlMV VLPs displaying this peptide elicited a potent antibody response and protection against viral challenge infection in mice [67].",

Five of these peptides have been found to elicit IFN\u03b3 secretion (CD4+T cell stimulation), one of which was recognized by all five PBMC donors used in the study [337]. An epitope-based vaccine development approach has also been employed against anthrax by fusing target peptides to CPs of plant viruses. In one study, a 25-amino acid long peptide from protective antigen (PA) of B. anthracis was fused to a surface loop of the large subunit of CPMV CP and propagated in cowpea. The resulting chimeric CPMV CP VLPs displayed 60 copies of the anthrax peptide and were generated in multi-gram quantities [71]. Another group fused the small loop 15-amino acid long epitope from domain 4 of PA (PA-D4s) to the N-terminal region of AlMV CP, and infectious transcripts of recombinant AlMV RNA3 were used to inoculate transgenic N. tabacum expressing AlMV P1 and P2 replicase genes [338]. The chimeric AlMV particles accumulated in the plants in large quantities for an extended time period. IP administration of these AlMV-anthrax VLPs elicited a detectable anthrax-specific antibody response in two out of five immunized mice, when compared with mice immunized with control recombinant AlMV or purified PA [338].",

A new VLP vaccine candidate for rabies has been produced in agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana plants and is under development by Medicago Inc. (Quebec, QC, Canada).

For this, chimeric CPMV VLPs have been engineered to display the VP2 epitope shared by mink enteritis virus, canine parvovirus and feline panleukopenia virus, and produced in black-eyed bean, Vigna unguiculata. SC vaccination with these VLPs was found to protect minks against clinical disease and virus shedding after challenge with virulent mink enteritis virus [348], and dogs against lethal challenge with canine parvovirus [349]. In another study, a 17-amino acid long peptide from canine parvovirus fused to small or large subunits of CP was displayed on the chimeric CPMV particles [350]. Mice vaccinated SC or IN with these chimeric VLPs developed peptide-specific antibody responses. The immune responses were markedly Th1 biased, as determined by a predominantly IgG2a isotype secretion and the release of IFN\u03b3 but not IL-4 or IL-5 from antigen-stimulated lymphocytes in vitro. Notably, both SC and IN vaccination induced serum neutralizing antibodies and peptide-specific mucosal IgA antibodies in intestinal and bronchial lavage fluids [350]. Combination of systemic and mucosal routes for priming and boosting vaccinations did not alter the Th1 bias of the immune responses, but resulted in optimal serum and intestinal antibody production [351].",

HPV16 L1 was stably expressed in N. tabacum cv. Xanthi and demonstrated to assemble into capsomers and VLPs retaining the neutralizing and conformational epitopes. Rabbits immunized with these plant-produced particles developed weak anti-HPV16 L1 immune responses [352]. HPV11 L1 protein without the C-terminal nuclear localization signal sequence (to enhance mRNA stability and protein accumulation) has been produced at a high level in transgenic A. thaliana and N. tabacum cv. Xanthi. Immunization of rabbits with transgenic plant extracts induced low titers of serum antibodies that neither reacted with native HPV11 L1 VLPs nor neutralized HPV11 infectious pseudovirions [353]. Expression of plant codon-optimized HPV11 L1 protein with a deleted C-terminal nuclear localization signal sequence in transgenic potato resulted in the formation of abundant 55-nm diameter spherical VLPs resembling authentic HPV virions as shown by an EM analysis of tuber extract. Feeding mice with transgenic HPV11 L1 potato tubers elicited an anti-HPV antibody response that was markedly enhanced following oral boosting with purified HPV11 L1 VLPs produced in insect cells [354]. In another study, HPV16 L1 protein was expressed at low to modest levels in transgenic tobacco and potato and self-assembled into 55-nm VLPs, with a small portion of capsomers, in transgenic tobacco, as confirmed by EM and sucrose gradient analyses [355]. The immunogenicity of HPV16 L1 VLPs was comparable with that of HPV VLPs produced in insect cells. A few mice fed with tubers from transgenic potatoes (three out of 24 mice) developed weak anti-L1 antibody responses, but the responses were significantly enhanced following IP or oral boosting with a subimmunogenic dose of purified insect cell-derived VLPs, indicating efficient priming by plant-produced VLPs [355]. In contrast to L1 VLP formation in transgenic potato and tobacco, modified HPV16 L1 protein self-assembled into capsomers in transplastomic tobacco [356].",

Complex size distribution of these particles differentiated them from VLP preparations observed in the commercial HBsAg VLP vaccine derived from recombinant H. polymorpha\n[371]. Furthermore, HBsAg M polypeptide containing an additional 55-amino acid long pre-S2 region at the N-terminus of S protein was expressed in both transiently and stably transformed N. benthamiana and shown to form VLPs [359]. IP administration of purified VLPs elicited stronger serum antibody responses against HBsAg in mice compared with S protein [359].",

Transient expression of HBcAg in N. benthamiana was achieved using PVX and CPMV-based vectors [373]. Although both vector systems allowed for the correct assembly of HBcAg VLPs, as confirmed by immunoEM, expression levels were low and wild-type plant virus particles were co-produced. In contrast, using the MagnICON vector system and gene optimization for plant expression, a dramatically increased level of HBcAg VLP production was achieved (up to 7% of total soluble protein or 2% of fresh weight), and 30 nm particles were observed, similar to HBcAg VLPs produced in E. coli\n[374]. Partially purified HBcAg VLPs were immunogenic in mice when administered IP with Imject alum adjuvant (serum IgG) or orally or IN without adjuvant (serum IgG and mucosal IgA), suggesting strong potential for HBcAg VLPs, not only as an HBV vaccine but also as a foreign epitope presentation system for mucosal delivery. Indeed, HBcAg with a fused neutralizing epitope of HPV16 L2 protein formed chimeric VLPs [375]. The BYDV-based shuttle vector has also been used to rapidly produce HBcAg VLPs in N. benthamiana\n[364].",

In this system, CMV CP that was expressed under the control of PVX subgenomic promoters self-assembled into CMV VLPs encapsidating subgenomic RNA encoding CMV CP and PVX RNA downstream of ORF3 of the hybrid virus [385]. Two short neutralizing NDV epitopes were chosen to be fused to the \u03b2H-\u03b2I loop (motif 5) of CMV CP: (1) 17-amino acid epitope of NDV F protein (amino acids 65\u201381), (2) 8-amino acid epitope of NDV HN protein (amino acids 346\u2013353), and (3) both epitopes fused in tandem. The chimeric VLPs were stably expressed in plants, and correct presentation and folding of the epitopes were confirmed using NDV-specific antisera [385]. Furthermore, transmission EM of sucrose gradient-purified VLP preparations showed their morphological identity with wild-type CMV particles [386]. Immunization with NDV epitope-carrying CMV CP VLPs induced antigen-specific antibodies in chickens [386].",

Nano-VLPs are one of the latest developments in this field and have only been tested in a pre-clinical setting [388], [389], [390]. The approach uses natural properties of amino acids of a polypeptide to self-assemble and allows for inserting immunogenic epitopes. Although at an early stage of development, this approach shows promise for recombinant vaccine design and development. Virosomes, on the other hand, have been used for presenting target antigens from a number of pathogens, and some of them have entered clinical development (see below in this section). Virosomes essentially represent enveloped VLPs assembled in vitro rather than inside a host cell. For the production of virosomes, a purified and inactivated parental virus undergoes detergent dissociation to separate the envelope fraction containing lipids and membrane-associated viral proteins from the core complex containing internal proteins and genetic material. Upon removal of detergent, the envelope fraction components assemble into empty virosomal particles. Depending on the desired type of immune response to be induced by the virosomal vaccine, the recombinant or synthetic antigen can be either displayed on the virosome surface (by integration or anchorage into the lipid bilayer, cross-linkage to membrane-associated viral proteins via a lipid anchor, or absorbance to the bilayer surface) or incorporated into its lumen, stimulating antibody production or CTL responses, respectively [391].",

Several influenza virosome-based vaccines produced by Pevion Biotech AG (Bern, Switzerland) are also at different stages of clinical development (Table 2). A therapeutic virosomal HCV vaccine candidate has been developed to clear chronic hepatitis C infection. The vaccine was engineered by encapsulating two viral peptides \u2013 CTL epitopes \u2013 into the virosome, and displaying one viral peptide \u2013 a CD4+ T cell epitope \u2013 on the virosome surface, and thus is intended to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses [394], [395]. In a Phase 1 study the vaccine was well tolerated, but levels of T cell responses were not satisfactory [391]. A bivalent virosomal malaria vaccine displaying two synthetic peptides from two P. falciparum proteins \u2013 CSP and the apical membrane antigen 1 \u2013 was designed to induce protective antibody responses against both sporozoites and merozoites and has been tested in four Phase 1/2 clinical trials, demonstrating safety, immunogenicity and ability to produce long-lasting sporozoite-inhibitory antibody titers [29], [30], [31], [32]. As a further example, a vaccine against Candida albicans was engineered by linking a recombinant truncated form of Sap2 protein, the virulence factor of the fungus, to a virosome to induce protective mucosal antibodies [391], [396] and has been demonstrated to be safe and highly immunogenic in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial [397], [398].",

            "text": "During the last four decades, there has been a significant increase in the development of recombinant SUVs using heterologous expression systems. Antigens from many viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal pathogens have been tested for effective and safe vaccine development. In a number of cases, specific vaccine antigens have been produced using different expression systems and have performed comparably well to licensed recombinant vaccines [407], [408], suggesting the critical importance of design and representation of specific antigens and their ability to generate protective immune responses. Although many antigens have been produced and evaluated as components of candidate SUVs, only a few have reached the market. Today, all recombinant SUVs on the market are based on VLPs. The only SUV approaching the market that is not based on a VLP is Protein Sciences\u2019 influenza vaccine [409], [410]. However, even in this case, the vaccine consists of trimers or higher-order aggregates of HA. As we gain more knowledge about each pathogen, the human immune system, host-pathogen interactions and mechanisms of enhancing target-specific immune responses, it is anticipated that a broader range of SUVs will be developed, potentially including non-VLP-based examples. To date, however, VLP-based SUVs appear superior in eliciting target-specific protective responses in humans. Although the underlying mechanisms of protective immune responses elicited by VLP-based SUVs are not fully understood, the critical importance of VLP greater structural complexity has been emphasized by many studies. VLP designs allow for producing multicomponent vaccines that structurally resemble human or animal pathogens, and are thus recognized by the human immune system in a similar manner to pathogens. Each protein component is presented in the VLP's structure similarly to presentation on the pathogen. Reproducing this effect using other, non-VLP, approaches is currently not feasible.",

            "text": "Particulate structure and multivalent epitope organization are not the only reasons for stronger immunogenicity and protective efficacy of VLPs compared to non-assembled SUVs. While purification procedures result in highly pure soluble proteins, VLPs produced in different expression systems are often contaminated with residual host cell components such as lipids, nucleic acids and proteins that may stimulate the innate immunity and augment the adaptive immune response [5]. For example, yeast cell membrane components contaminating the preparations of yeast-derived HIV-1 Pr55Gag VLPs were shown to contribute to DC activation and the effect was partially mediated by signaling through Toll-like receptors [128]. Similarly, components of insect cells and recombinant baculoviruses induced activation of DCs and other antigen presenting cells, promoting strong Th1 type-biased immune responses [5]. According to the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use regulatory guidelines, however, host cell contaminants that affect the immune system represent a major safety concern [411], which may have a significant impact on the vaccine development path based on this approach. Lessons learned from the development and use of current VLPs as well as full pathogen-based vaccines would be highly valuble in continued use of this approach or successful product development.",
