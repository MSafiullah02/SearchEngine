Since the upper respiratory tract harbors a high viral load,3 otolaryngologists are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 transmission while performing head and neck procedures that utilize suction and powered instrumentation, such as the surgical drill, especially if they are doing so without appropriate protective personal equipment.4 With its connection to the nasopharynx through the eustachian tube, the middle ear can serve as a possible source of transmission for upper respiratory tract pathogens10 during routine otologic procedures, such as myringotomy and mastoidectomy. With the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population for the foreseeable future, we will need to navigate these risks as we resume elective surgical procedures and perform urgent operations on patients whose SARS-CoV-2 status is unknown or positive.",

The potential for aerosolization remains, however, when suction is used across a mucosal surface. In contrast, a complete mastoidectomy performed in standard fashion resulted in gross contamination up to 6 ft from the surgical site, which was the farthest distance measured. Aerosol generation with surgical drills has been established in the orthopedic literature.13 This is likely secondary to the nature of the operation, which involves high-speed drilling of the temporal bone under irrigation creating visible splatter from bone dust and irrigation droplets. Our study also demonstrated that significantly more droplet and splatter occur to the left of the surgeon, which corresponds to the direction of rotation of the drill. Those within 1 to 3 ft of the drill are at increased risk of exposure. In teaching institutions where multiple members of the team may be directly adjacent to the primary surgeon, this must be taken into account. While the drill is being operated, all steps should be taken to reduce the number of other people within a 3- to 6-ft radius.",

            "text": "Several limitations to this cadaveric simulation study deserve consideration. These procedures were not conducted in a normal adult clinic setting with an actively respiring patient. With stimulation of the external auditory canal during examination, patients can produce a cough reflex that may cause increased risk of viral transmission. Moreover, there was no assessment of aerosolization, either forced (eg, sneezing) or from drilling, in this experimental model. However, we believe that it is still vital to understand the quantity, quality, and range of droplet and splatter contamination involved during these common procedures, as respiratory droplets are considered to be the primary mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Another limitation is that only droplets and splatter visible to the human eye were measured. Furthermore, instead of a complete 360\u00b0 assessment, the design model allowed for measurements only in the cardinal directions surrounding the specimen.",

This will not be easily accomplished, because it is difficult to operate a microscope while wearing a face shield or powered air-purifying respiratory. Risks to the rest of the surgical staff and anesthesia team also are present in the operating room, which highlights that additional protective personal equipment is necessary for the surgical team, not just the operating surgeon. Carron et al recently published a simple technique involving the use of 2 readily available clear surgical drapes to control droplet and splatter contamination during mastoidectomy.14 They reported that surgical visualization was not affected. Although a good step in the right direction for preventing the spread of gross contaminant, this methodology does not create an air-tight surgical field, and droplet or splatter contamination was not measured in any objective way. Further studies should be performed comparing different techniques to determine the extent of prevention of droplet contamination and aerosolization.",
