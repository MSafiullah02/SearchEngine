This is due to collisions where different q-grams are hashed to the same BF bit positions. TH results in more accurate similarities, where encoded similarities can be both above and below the q-gram set similarities. Hence, the similarities calculated on BFs and with TH can lead to inaccurate PPRL results, and thus wrong follow-up analysis.\n",

We also note that as l increases the similarity difference between the integer and q-gram sets gets lower which results in less false negatives. Figure 5 shows linkage quality results in terms of precision and recall. 2SH achieves higher recall and precision compared to both BF and TH. As we encode more attribute values, recall decreases similar to BF and TH encodings. This is because different q-grams are hashed into the same positions leading to different integer values to be generated for similar q-gram sets and resulting in false negatives. As we discussed in Sect. 4, increasing l can reduce the number of false negatives.\n",

We noted the number of such correct re-identifications increases for smaller numbers of attribute values and with the increase of l. This is because the frequencies of q-grams can be correctly identified as less q-grams are mapped to a certain column position in the first hashing step. However, as we hash more attribute values with more hash functions, an adversary will not be able to re-identify attribute values because not enough frequency information is available to identify q-grams that are encoded into integer values. Hence, conducting such a frequency attack upon integer sets that are encoded with q-grams from different attributes will unlikely be successful.",

We used a two-step hashing process to encode sensitive values into integer sets. Our analysis showed that our encoding can provide high linkage quality, validated on large real databases, where it can achieve higher quality similarity calculations compared to other encoding techniques used in PPRL. Our approach also provides privacy against frequency attacks on integer sets which prevents the re-identification of encoded sensitive values. As future work we aim to extend the experiments with different hashing techniques in our encoding approach. Another future research avenue is to find the optimal values for the length of bit vectors and the number of hash function used in the encoding process that can maximise both linkage quality and privacy. Furthermore, we plan to adapt existing privacy attacks for our encoding and conduct a privacy comparison with other PPRL techniques.",
