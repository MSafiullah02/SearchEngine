It appears that media reports on celebrity suicides are more likely to have such an effect than those of non-celebrity suicides (Stack, 2000, Wasserman, 1984). Furthermore, the impact of suicides of entertainment celebrities appears to have a larger impact than that of other types of celebrity (Stack, 1987, Wasserman, 1984).",

People come to learn the details of methods of suicide through media reporting of them, such as asphyxiation from the smoke of burning charcoal, especially in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan (Chan et al., 2005). Suicide deaths by charcoal burning have increased from 3% in 1997 to 24% in 2002 of the total suicide death (Yip et al., 2005). The relationship between media reporting of non-fictional suicides and subsequent suicides can reasonably be regarded as causal (Hawton and Williams, 2005, p. 303; Pirkis and Blood, 2001, p. 150).",

His funeral was held on 8th April 2003 and there was extensive media coverage of his death. According to an electronic news clipping database, which covers all of Hong Kong's newspapers, there were 1243 news articles with his English name or Chinese name during the period between the 2nd April 2003 and 9th April 2003. This compared with only 12 news articles in the preceding week from 25th March to 1st April (WiserNews, 2003). Of the 1243 articles, 565 (46%) of them mentioned his full name or his nickname in the headline and 35 (3%) were on the front page of the newspapers. On six of the eight days between the 2nd and 9th April (except 4th April and 5th April) at least one newspaper reported news of Cheung's death on the front page. Most of the newspaper articles were published in the first 16 days after his death (1701 articles). During the subsequent 16 days there were 315 articles, and during the next 16 days only 102 articles.",

Therefore to allow a robust comparison of the monthly distribution of suicides against the background of this increasing trend, we detrended the monthly suicide numbers by subtracting the mean of the first six months in the corresponding year from the monthly figures. (Kaiser and Maravall, 2001, Harvey and Proietti, 2005). The number of suicides in April 2003 was compared with the average for the first six months of the year, the average for the immediately preceding three months (January\u2013March 2003), and with the average for April in the preceding 5 years (1998\u20132002). A chi-square test was used to examine the significance of differences in distribution.

The police reports and suicide notes provide another source of information about factors contributing to suicide. There were 13 cases in 2003 in which the death of Cheung was mentioned in either a suicide note (5 cases) or records of the police investigation (8 cases). In one case there was mention in both sources. The cases occurred between April and October 2003. The contents of the deaths notes are summarized in Appendix A. Among these 13 cases, nine were male and six of these were aged 25\u201339 years. Four individuals expressed their suicidal intentions implicitly or explicitly by mentioning their desire either \u201cto accompany Cheung\u201d or \u201cto follow his way to exit\u201d (Cases 6, 10, 11 and 12). The remaining three individuals included people with life problems (Cases 8 and 9) and general distress (Case 13). It is unusual for a celebrity to be mentioned in a suicide note and only about 20% of suicides in Hong Kong are accompanied by suicide notes. The content of these notes commonly states the victim's specific instructions, including funeral arrangement, expresses affection for family members and loved ones, and gives details of the individual's own personal difficulties, health and/or financial problems (Ho et al., 1998).",

However, the overall effect on suicides appears to have been relatively short lived. Other research on celebrity suicides or deaths has also shown relatively short-term effects on suicides, usually of between two and four weeks (Hawton et al., 2000, Phillips, 1974, Stack, 1987). It is important to note that there was no significant decrease in suicides in May or June 2003. This is consistent with previous studies which have rejected the hypothesis that the imitative effect caused suicides to occur earlier than would otherwise have been the case (Hawton et al., 2000, Phillips, 1974). However, the death investigation files from the Coroner's Court showed that some further individuals who died by suicide between May and October 2003 had also mentioned the name of Cheung in suicide notes. This suggests the possibility that celebrity suicide could have a longer-term effect, even though it might be insufficient to have a significant effect on the aggregated monthly suicide rate.",

If the high unemployment rate contributed to the rise in suicides the effect should have been seen not only in April but for an extended period. Also, the months of May\u2013July period and not April had the highest unemployment rate (8.5%) in Hong Kong. Furthermore, it should have affected the community as a whole rather than a particular subgroup, and a particular method of suicide. Though the outbreak of SARS hits Hong Kong badly, there was no marked increase in suicides during May and June even though the community was still very much in the midst of SARS throughout the territory. In addition there was no increase in suicides during the SARS crisis in Singapore, which was also severely affected in 2003 (Chia, in preparation).

This conclusion is consistent with research from other countries which has shown that the death of a celebrity can ignite a contagious effect within a community (Hawton et al., 2000, Takahashi, 1998, Tousignant et al., 2005). For this reason, the World Health Organization has listed \u201ctoning down reports in the media\u201d as one of its six key strategies on suicide prevention (World Health Organization, 1998). Improving media reporting and portrayal of suicidal behaviour is also one of the major initiatives included in the national suicide prevention strategies of several countries (Commonwealth of Australia, 2000, Department of Health and Human Services, 2001, Department of Health, 2002). Media professionals should be well informed about the potential risks associated with reporting celebrity suicides. Several media guidelines are available to assist media professionals on how to report suicide news in a responsible manner (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2002, Center for Suicide Research and Prevention, 2004, Samaritans, 2002, World Health Organization, 2000). However, a systematic review of suicide prevention strategies has highlighted the need for evaluation of the effectiveness of such guidelines (Mann et al., 2005).",

We cannot be certain of the mechanisms involved in the increase in suicides following Cheung's death. It might have been due to bereavement effects of his death rather than a modeling effect of celebrity suicide. However, our analysis of suicide notes and police reports suggests that copycat suicidal behaviour is likely to have been the main mechanism.",
