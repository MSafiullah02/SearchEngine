            "text": "Viral respiratory infection is a leading cause of hospitalizations, acute care visits, and antibiotic overuse in children [1]. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of a respiratory virus in a respiratory specimen [2]. Traditional diagnostic methods include viral isolation by cell culture and detection of viral antigens by immunofluorescence. The superior sensitivity of molecular methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has led to their increased use in clinical laboratories [3], [4]. Still, some authors suggest performing viral culture in a backup role in respiratory specimens from high-risk populations to detect viruses that are not part of the RT-PCR assay or whose genomes have mutations that may lead to false-negative RT-PCR results [5], [6]. However, the implementation of a second diagnostic step, i.e., viral culture after a negative RT-PCR result, is associated with additional costs and unknown effect on clinical management.",

A major drawback of traditional tube cell cultures is the long turnaround time, which can take between 2 days to 2 weeks to produce a result. For this reason, the clinical usefulness of the technique is guarded as the result may arrive too late to impact physician decision making [12]. In our study, only patients with HSV infection had their management changed due to viral culture. This could be explained in part by the shorter time to positivity for HSV and the availability of specific antiviral treatment (acyclovir). Another limitation of viral culture is that some respiratory viruses, e.g., group C rhinovirus, some group A coxackieviruses, coronaviruses, and polyomaviruses KIV and WUV, neither replicate nor produce identifiable cytopathic effect in standard cell culture lines [13], [14], [15].",

Moreover, infections caused by viruses with genetic mutations may be falsely negative by PCR [3], [6], [17]. Viral culture may have additional advantages at the public health level for monitoring phenotypic antiviral susceptibilities, informing vaccine development, and identifying rare or novel strains. Because of the limitations and advantages of different diagnostic methods for respiratory viruses, a combination of methods is still recommended by some authors [5].
