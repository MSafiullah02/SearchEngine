Sometimes, it can break the news before newswire\u2014a well-known electronic service that transmits the latest news stories via the Internet. Research conducted at Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow showed that mainstream media ignored a large number of minor news events [4]. Detecting events from Twitter provides new insight into the searchable information related to real-life. The area of event detection has sparsely studied and is not a new phenomenon. However, the characteristics of Twitter data make it a non-trivial task. Existing systems [1\u20133, 5] typically focus on the burstiness of the data. It is naive to employ burstiness as a key feature to detect the occurrence of events. A rise in tweets frequency related to a long term event often dominates other small but newsworthy events [7, 8]. People report major events more often for an extended period. In results, the existing system does not correspond to other events that might be interesting to several users. In this work, we developed an application based on a novel Dynamic Heartbeat Graph (DHG) approach [9] that exploits the dynamic nature of Twitter data for event detection. It detects newsworthy events from the Twitter stream by capturing the change and cohesiveness among the event-related topics. In a nutshell, Fig. 1 presents the work-flow of the event detection approach with the help of a toy example. The next section collectively describes the framework and system design in detail.\n",

Based on the live or retrospective orientation of the event, the crawler gathers tweets and creates a full-text index using Lucene API2. The raw tweets are forwarded to the pre-processing module. Filtration is applied to the data based on heuristics to remove specific tweets, i.e., duplicate, re-tweets, containing URLs, having less than three words, and tweets that do not contain any words other than hashtag(s) and mention(s). The classic IR approach is then used for tokenization, stop/common word removal, and stemming. The clean data is passed on to the DHG approach module that performs four significant tasks, which are the backbone of the EventSense. DHG approach module transforms the data stream into a series of difference graph called the DHG series and extracts three unique features that are later used to detect emerging events3.\n",
