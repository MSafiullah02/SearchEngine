Infections caused by A. baumannii presented similar epidemiologic patterns in CAP and HAP, with a seasonal variation and a peak in the late summer. CAP caused by A. baumannii has a mortality rate of 50% [76] , and in the case of HAP the severity of the underlying disease determines the fatality rate. Garnacho-Montero et al [74] noted that antibiotic exposure was the only independent risk factor associated with VAP caused by A. baumannii.

Among these, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are the most frequently reported. M. pneumoniae accounts for up to 37% of CAP in patients treated as outpatients and 10% of cases requiring hospitalization [41,47].
