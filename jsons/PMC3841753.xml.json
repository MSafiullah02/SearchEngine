Self-reported respiratory symptoms were collected at baseline in 2009 and 2010 only. Influenza vaccination status was validated for current and previous influenza seasons from hospital and general practitioner (GP) records, with GPs contacted via facsimile or telephone.

Influenza vaccination is efficacious in preventing severe influenza, reducing the incidence of pneumonia and death in the elderly24 and is also a cost-effective intervention25 recommended by national expert committees. Australia funds immunisation for adults aged \u226565 years and those with pre-existing risk conditions with both influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.26 Although estimated influenza vaccination levels are high (>70%) for the age group \u226565 years, uptake in younger at-risk groups is low.27 This was reflected in our study, with controls who were on average older and eligible to receive free influenza vaccination had higher rates of vaccination, whereas the AMI cases, despite being at risk were on average younger and therefore not eligible for free vaccination had much lower vaccination uptake.",

The sample size, although adequate to detect a difference in influenza positive results, was small considering the number of vaccinated participants, but the study was intensive and difficult to conduct, and achieving final sample size required 3 years of recruitment. Australia has a funded influenza vaccination programme for people aged 65 years and older, with uptake rates >85%. Our controls were older than AMI cases, and therefore more likely to be vaccinated and more likely to be living alone, which could affect exposure status. Given the strong relationship between age and vaccination uptake, and the older age of controls, the study would have benefited from being individually age-matched. However, we adjusted for age in our model, and influenza vaccination remained significant. Further, controls were recruited from outpatient clinics and representative of community-acquired influenza. While there is the possibility that controls may have not attended due to severe influenza infection, the majority of participants found to have laboratory evidence of influenza did not report acute respiratory symptoms. The modelling adjusted for the factors which were unequally distributed between cases and controls. It is reassuring that known risk factors of age, current smoking and high cholesterol were found to be significant predictors of AMI in our model, the last being the two largest predictors of AMI in the INTERHEART study.31 Our study did not find a self-reported history of diabetes or hypertension or alcohol consumption to be predictors of AMI.31 While we did not control for all possible confounders, residual confounding is a concern for all case-control studies if confounding variables are not measured or adjusted for. For example, influenza vaccination was excluded from the INTERHEART study.31 We believe we have included all major confounders in our model. The low national influenza season in 2010 limited our statistical power and may explain why influenza infection did not significantly predict AMI. The number of vaccinated subjects was far greater than the number with documented influenza infection, therefore affording greater statistical power for examining the association of AMI with vaccination. Our study is strengthened by collection over a number of influenza seasons and the use of laboratory-confirmed influenza as a primary variable of interest, rather than self-reported ARTI, which is subject to biases. With a strict definition of AMI, it is unlikely that misclassification of AMI has occurred, which would unduly bias VE calculations. An overestimation of vaccination status would bias VE estimates; however, we have classified vaccination status based on GP verified reports, in which more than 75% of participants were able to be verified.",
