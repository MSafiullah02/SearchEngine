Thrombi are formed in the lower extremities but also in the pelvic region and give rise to emboli. Large emboli will get stuck in the large pulmonary arteries and cause sudden death with the symptoms similar to cardiac infarct. Smaller emboli might be pressed into smaller arteries and get stuck there. These emboli will cause a hemorrhagic infarct by occlusion of a pulmonary artery and retrograde infl ux of blood from the venous side as well as from bronchial arteries. Since the lung has a double system of blood fl ow, bronchial and pulmonary system ischemic infarcts do not occur -there is one exception, ischemic infarct in vasculitis.",

On cut surface the infarct is dark red with a hemorrhagic dark blue-red border. The consistency is fi rm. On histology, the center of the infarct has lost staining of the cells (no nuclei visible), and the cells appear like ghost cells; however, the alveolar structure is still visible (Fig. 11.1 ). If the infarct is older, an infl ammatory granulation tissue develops (usually a type of organizing pneumonia), which slowly will organize the infarct and replace it with scar tissue. Even as scar the cuneiform fi gure will remain. At the border of the infarct, numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages will appear. Elastic stains can easily highlight obstructed arteries. Typically there are thick-walled arteries in the vicinity of the infarct, probably refl ecting increased vascular pressure.",

Vasculitis typically develops in a previously asthmatic middle-aged patient. Asthma is severe, associated with eosinophilia and extrapulmonary symptoms. Some patients report allergic rhinitis without asthma. Most frequently EGPA involves the peripheral nerves and skin (allergic superfi cial eosinophilic vasculitis). Other organs such as the heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, if affected, confer a poorer prognosis. In about 30-40 % of the patients, anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) are present [ 2 ] . EGPA patients with anti-MPO ANCA suffered more, albeit not exclusively, from vasculitis symptoms, such as glomerulonephritis, mononeuritis multiplex, and alveolar hemorrhage, whereas ANCA-negative patients more frequently develop heart involvement [ 6 , 7 ] . In recent time EGPA has been linked to new antiasthmatic drugs such as montelukast. However, new investigations have ruled out this as a possible cause of the disease [ 8 ] . Elevated IgG4 levels were found in active EGPA patients compared to controls. Serum IgG4 correlated with the number of eosinophils. During treatment and in disease remission, both IgG4 level and IgG4/IgG ratio dropped [ 9 ] .",

In ( a ) and ( b ) eosinophilic vasculitis is shown with a small necrotic focus and few scattered epithelioid and giant cells. In ( c ) a patient with EGPA was treated with corticosteroids for 2 weeks before the transbronchial biopsy was taken. This resulted that the vasculitis was no longer present (no endothelial necrosis, no infi ltration of the vascular wall), but the eosinophilia could still be evaluated. In ( de ) an eosinophilic vasculitis is present, here predominantly as capillaritis. But there is also organizing pneumonia as a sign of a long-standing process with repair. H&E, \u00d750 and 100 involve the kidneys. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is most commonly seen in small vessel vasculitides, specifi cally MPA [ 12 ] . There is a wide variation of possible underlying diseases, but some might also be coincidentally associated with MPA. The most common are chronic airway diseases (CAD), where MPO-ANCA tended to be lower than in the non-CAD group. None of the patients in the CAD group had pulmonary hemorrhage or interstitial pneumonia. Also the outcome in the CAD group was better than in the non-CAD group [ 13 ] .",

Dail many years ago pointed to a connection of these three in his thesis work. Primary pulmonary hypertension is caused by a vascular obstruction of medium to small blood vessels. As a reaction a secondary proliferation of small capillaries with a glomerulum-like appearance is started -the so-called plexiform lesion (Fig. 11.19 ). The driving forces are vascular factors such as VEGF, endothelin, endostatin, and their receptors (Fig. 11.19d ). Small areas of necrosis can occur, and a hemangioma-like dilation of veins is typically found around these proliferations ( Fig. 11.19e ). Small areas of necrosis can occur. Larger arteries will show vessel wall thickening and stenosis. Bleeding and hemosiderin deposits can be found; however, no large hemorrhage will be seen.",

Mutations in bone morphogenic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) have been discovered, and it has been shown that BMPR2 mutations in different exons result in altered function. However, BMPR2 mutations are found in only a minority of PAH patients [ 30 , 31 ] . So it is speculated that disease modifi er genes might exist. Activin-like kinase type I (ALK1) was found altered in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Since both genes belong to the TGF\u03b2 family, this pathway might be most probably affected [ 31 ] . BMP receptors 1 and 2 associate to form homo-or heterodimers. BMP4, a ligand for BMPR2, inhibits the proliferation of arterial muscle cells from proximal pulmonary arteries but stimulates proliferation of peripheral arteries. In iPAH hypoxia induces production of endothelium-derived BMP4, associated with increased proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) was found to be overexpressed in PAH [ 32 ] . Functional polymorphism of the 5-HTT gene promoter has been demonstrated in some patients, an increase of the expression of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) in others. This all result in an abnormally strong proliferative response to serotonin. Interestingly appetitesuppressant drugs are potent inhibitors of neuronal 5-HT uptake and inhibit 5-HTT.",
