Such variability might have important implications in viral disease pathogenesis, and the study of viral genome evolution within a host can provide vital information important in developing and assessing antiviral agents [26] . For example, development of antiviral drug resistance during individualized therapy that is associated with poor outcome has been described extensively with influenza virus [27] [28] [29] . Grad et al reported intrahost genome evolution of respiratory syncytial virus over time in an infant with severe combined immune deficiency who underwent a bone marrow transplant [30] . The viral population diversity dramatically increased after engraftment, which appeared to reflect dynamic response to immune pressure from host immunity. To our knowledge, no previous data exist describing how the HCoV genome evolves within a host over time. In the current study, engraftment occurred in 4 of 5 patients sequenced prior to the onset of shedding. Interestingly, no SNPs were recovered <30 days after the onset of shedding even after immune reconstitution. Variants accumulated starting at 1 month after the onset of shedding (1-6 changes over time), consistent with the previously estimated evolution rates of HCoV [13, 14] . Given the relatively slow evolution rate of coronaviruses, these observations could be promising from the standpoint of antiviral resistance and therapeutic development [13, 14] . Due to their exceptionally large RNA genomes, coronaviruses are known to encode highly processive polymerases as well as proofreading exoribonucleases that temper viral genome evolution relative to other RNA viruses [31] [32] [33] .

Similarly, although no particular strain appeared to be associated with prolonged shedding, strain identification using saved samples was successful in only 70% of the patients, which limited our ability to detect small difference of shedding duration among each HCoV strain. Further studies with larger sample sizes will help to clarify the distinct association between particular HCoV strains and prolonged shedding. Finally, our cohort included 4 patients who had documented HCoV shedding prior to transplant. Considering the unmeasured influence of their different backgrounds on our analyses, we separately analyzed 40 patients who started shedding after transplant. Only univariable logistic regression analysis could be performed due to the small sample size, with similar results. This is the first study to evaluate risk factors associated with prolonged shedding of HCoV by quantitative and strain-specific reverse transcription PCR as well as intrahost genomic evolutions by metagenomic RNA sequencing in transplant recipients. Our study provides critical information to develop antiviral therapies and design randomized trials with viral load endpoints. In addition, as the duration of shedding is an important determinant of viral infectivity and transmissibility, predictive factors for prolonged shedding may provide useful information for effective infection control, such as the expected duration of isolation.
