These resources are not found in most offices and would require significant capital investment to upgrade to this level of isolated treatment room. Next come the decontamination procedures, which, as described, would require a highly trained workforce-a literal SWAT team of environmental cleaning specialists trained to decontaminate the work area between each patient. 4 After reviewing the guidelines pertaining to ATDs and decontamination of the operatory, it was apparent that treating all patients as suspected or actual COVID-19 patients was a non-starter. However, if we could make an informed decision about which patients we could treat safely using standard precautions-surgical cap, mask, full-length gown, and eye protection and conventional room decontamination procedures-could we then continue to serve at least a subset of patients in our offices and clinics?

In my local environment, the prevalence of SC-2 infection among patients scheduled for an urgent operation was 0.8%. To be conservative, I estimated a 95% confidence interval and chose the upper limit, 3%, as the estimate of COVID-19 prevalence among asymptomatic patients. Next, I estimated the filtration effectiveness of the surgical mask. To be conservative, I chose a Level I mask that is >95% effective at filtering particles of relevant size, >0.3 microns. As such, the leakage rate should be <5%. Finally, we need to know the false negative rate for testing nasopharyngeal samples for SC-2. Locally, this is estimated to be <2%. By multiplying these three values, 3% x <5% x <2%, the estimated risk for SC-2 exposure if the patients you treat are limited to asymptomatic, SC-2 test negative, and you are wearing a level 1 surgical mask is <3 SC-2 exposures per 100,000 patient encounters.

Holding the other variables constant, the estimated risk for SC-2 exposure in this sample is 13% x <5% x <2% or <13 SC-2 exposures per 100,000 patient encounters.

Estimates of COVID-19 among symptomatic patients hovers around 10%. Therefore, the prevalence among asymptomatic patients must be lower. To be conservative, however, let us set the prevalence at 10% and mask filtration leakage at <1%. The estimate for SC-2 exposure in this model is 10% x <1% or <100 exposure results in COVID-19, the prevalence of disease is 3%, the mask leakage is <5%, the false negative rate is <2%, and the chance of death is 5%. Thus, the overall risk of death is 1.5 deaths per 1,000,000 patient exposures. Is this safe? After spending some time working with this model and evaluating the recommendations of UW Medicine's surgical leadership, I recommended that we limit procedural care to asymptomatic patients who were SC-2 test negative. We limit in-person consultations to asymptomatic patients while wearing masks, both provider and patient.
