As outcomes are increasingly transparent at the surgeon level, faculty have become warier and even restrictive in what the residents are allowed to do. (4) Our responsibility as teachers, however, must remain to ensure residents learn what they need for independent practice.. Building trusted relationships and accurately evaluating resident operative competencies can effectively entrust responsibility while remaining in control of our outcomes Another important differentiator of Millennial residents is the fact that they thrive on realtime objective performance data and feedback.(1) The Competency-By-Design frame work in Canada and the Milestone project in the U.S.A. are both designed to train our residents to competency rather than time. (8, 9) However, again it is on us, the teachers, to inform ourselves on how to best train to competency, as most of us trained to time.",

(1) As this article clearly articulates, Millennial cardiothoracic surgery residents are training under unprecedented challenges. The imposed work hour restrictions is one of the most significant differences in our opinion.(2,3,) These restrictions, put in place originally to improve the quality of care, actually have not yet impacted patient safety.(2) Interestingly, allowing flexibility rather than purely restricting duty-hours have not adversely affected hospital finances nor patient experience.(3) Work hour restrictions have though affected resident autonomy.",
