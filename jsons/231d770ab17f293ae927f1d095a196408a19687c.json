The high population density of the country exacerbates human-transmission of diseases like influenza and has been considered a potential \"hot-spot\" for disease outbreaks. This was indeed the case in 2003 when SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) was brought to Singapore by residents returning from overseas resulting in 238 infection cases and 33 deaths [10] . Later in 2009, 11% of the Singapore population were estimated to be infected with the H1N1 influenza virus in the first 10 weeks after the epidemic began in the United States [11] . Recent proposed changes to the Infectious Diseases Act to turn away unvaccinated travelers to Singapore [12] signal awareness from authorities to protect residents from foreign disease vectors. However, adequate influenza prevention requires substantial herd immunity fostered through individuals' uptake of the seasonal vaccine. Unfortunately, experts' recognition of the value of vaccines as an effective preventive tool may not be shared equally by the public. This sentiment toward vaccines is reflected in low immunization rates as Gan [13] reports that \"adult vaccination rates in Singapore generally hover at below 20 percent\" and \"below 10 percent for those aged 50 to 69\" [14] . Given that disease incidence rates could be reduced with increased vaccine uptake [15] , nonvaccination against infectious diseases could instead pose risks of viral spread, increasing the probability of disease outbreaks.",

More than 2,800 daily cases of acute respiratory infections were reported to medical centers island wide in January 2017 and 2018 [18] . In 2006, Chow and colleagues [19] noted that influenza-associated deaths in Singapore between 1996 and 2003 were the highest among older adults aged 65 and above and further estimated that the yearly vaccine uptake rate among the elderly population is not greater than eight percent. More recent figures from the 2013 National Health Surveillance Survey also revealed that influenza vaccination coverage among Singaporeans aged 50 and above ranged from 14% to 20% [20] .",

Among older adults in Singapore, the most common second language used is Mandarin Chinese. Thus, all interviewers in our project had to be bilingual and conversant in English and Mandarin Chinese. While interviews were conducted primarily in English, our project team anticipated short usage of Mandarin Chinese by our participants and were trained to conduct member checks [28] . In such cases where a participant used terms or phrases in Mandarin, our interviewers conducted member checks in both English and Mandarin to best match nuances in language use. Participants were compensated with either 20 Singapore Dollars (approximately 15 US Dollars) cash or gift voucher at the end of the interviews. 76 participants who conformed to our inclusion criteria completed the interview, thus providing a robust sample and dataset from to allow for greater descriptive findings and saturation.",

Interviewers were trained to reflect upon the interviews and provided insights on participants' health misperceptions, personal background, health information seeking, vaccine information access, influenza perceptions, vaccination intentions, vaccine perceptions, social norms, nonverbal behaviors, and any other issues or outcomes from the interview. During this post-interview reflection, the researchers turned back to the audio recording as needed to amend and revise their observations. They also identified and transcribed any direct illustrative quotes from the participants and included them in their field notes while using the raw audio files to corroborate and identify any discrepancies. This approach has been noted to help minimize interviewer bias and improve cross-case comparisons following the documentation of findings [31] . Neither the field notes nor the findings were returned to the participants for comments and corrections.",

Older adults also tend to heuristically process complex information such as those related to health as their cognitive abilities decline with age [46] . Finucane [47] pointed out that older adults are inclined to rely more on emotion-evoking information and suggested that risk information may be portrayed with numeric displays, visuals and in narratives to enhance likelihood of message processing and increase message salience among older audiences. Orel, Spence, and Steele [48] proposed providing factual information to counteract misperceptions and discussing old age vulnerabilities to increase perceived disease susceptibility. Cummings [46] added that written instructions should be accompanied with verbal consultations with healthcare professionals to ensure message comprehension. Message tailoring to older audiences has also been recognized as an effective strategy in increasing information salience and can contribute to reducing information exposure barriers [49] . These recommendations can be incorporated into future communication to improve knowledge about influenza. Sparks and Nussbaum [50] suggested tailoring interpersonal messages to older adults' personal characteristics and information processing abilities to improve health knowledge. While their recommendation was oriented toward older cancer patients, this advice is not any less useful for encouraging vaccination among older adults now that this group's primary misperceptions about the influenza disease have been systematically identified in this study.",

This further signifies poor vaccine knowledge among older adults that may explain the low and delayed vaccine uptake (i.e., taking the vaccine only after signs of infection). Poor vaccine knowledge has been recognized as one of the barriers to influenza vaccination [51] . Our study adds that confusion between the functions of vaccines and antivirals is a form of poor vaccine knowledge. Vaccine communication should thus emphasize on the functionality of vaccines, that is, vaccines should be taken before an infection as a preventive measure.",

This corroborates the SAGE Working Group's Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix, in which the introduction of new formulation or new recommendations for existing vaccines was identified to influence hesitancy [52] . Participants' concerns may be alleviated with communication about vaccine safety (i.e., does not contain germs or zoonotic viruses) from multiple points such as the local government, health organizations, and health practitioners. More comprehensible explanations are necessary to instill knowledge about the mutability of influenza viruses and the need for vaccine manufacturers to produce new vaccines every year to protect users from circulating mutated influenza strains.",

Participants who reported having heard about the influenza vaccine cited doctors as their primary source for vaccine information. Most other participants reported that they have not received any information from their doctors nor had they been recommended the vaccine by healthcare professionals. Even if this is not the actual case-even if these individuals have been informed by healthcare professionals about the influenza vaccine, the message simply is not getting through satisfactorily. This highlights a significant communication gap between doctors and older patients and warrants reinvigorated efforts to adequately engage and ensure that older adults have access and attend to influenza vaccine communication from their healthcare providers. Older patients tend to exhibit less assertive and more paternalistic attitudes toward providers [53] which suggests that older adults may be more willing to comply with direct vaccination recommendations from healthcare professionals than their younger counterparts.",

First, even though the use of novice interviewers and executive summaries may have been an outcome of limited study resources, our data analysis relied on interviewers' extensive training, executive summaries and audio playbacks rather than full interview transcripts. This approach introduced the issue of subjective data selection and filtering through interviewers and hence the interpretation of incomplete or reduced qualitative data. Second, the use of nonprobability sampling techniques in recruiting participants limits the generalizability of our qualitative findings. Future replications using stratified sampling techniques are warranted to validate the findings from this present study. Last, language differences are inherent in this study that is conducted in polylingual Singapore where most older adults speak more often in their native language than in English. Despite our interviewers' language proficiency, interpreting and translating any Mandarin Chinese into English nonetheless pose challenges to the validity of our study findings.",

Whole year round nothing happens but end of the year. . .\" (Female, interview 26). Misperceptions about influenza transmission. Most participants reported incorrect knowledge about transmission modes of the influenza virus. Misperceptions about the source of influenza spread included (a) foreign countries, (b) animals, (c) the air, (d) the weather, (e) food types that are cooling, spicy, unclean, rich, or high in cholesterol, (f) wearing wet clothes, (g) a developing cold, (h) overexertion, and (i) toxins in the body. Misperceptions about influenza severity. Understandings about the severity of influenza varied widely. 29 participants (38.2% of the sample) perceived influenza to be serious and fatal providing insights including, \"If [influenza is] not taken care of, you [might] get pneumonia. And you hear people dying of pneumonia, which is ridiculous. I mean, our former P[rime] M [inister] Mr. Lee Kuan Yew died of pneumonia too\" (Male, interview 41).",
