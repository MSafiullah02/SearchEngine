On 7th January 2020 the Chinese authorities identified the source of the outbreak to be a new type of virus from the Coronaviridae family, which was called the ''novel coronavirus'', 2019-nCoV. The virus was later named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease was called COVID-19. On 30th January the World health Organisation declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China a public health emergency of international concern. 1 When you read this article 3 weeks will have passed since we wrote it and you may judge for yourselves whether the predictions made by the SEEIUC (Spanish Society of Intensive Care and Coronary Unit Nursing) and the SEMICYUC (Spanish Society of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units) in the contingency plan 1 we published on our web sites and social media came true.",

The usual ratio should be 1 nurse per shift and one for each two critically ill patients (up to 1:4 in SDUs), with a reinforcement of 1 nurse for every 4---6 beds who can offer support at moments of maximum workload (prone positioning, intubation, carrying out special techniques, transfers, etc.) and for possible substitutions in case of sick leave during shifts. The support nurse has to be an experienced professional who may supplement the lesser experience and knowledge of other professionals.'' At the same time as these recommendations were being made we became aware through the media that untrained nurses with no specialist training in critical care were being recruited to ICUs. Doctors had an advantage here, they proposed recruiting 4th and 5th year residents. But how were they going to be able to do this with nurses if a resident nurse for the medical---surgical speciality does not even exist? We can hardly bring ourselves to mention the long-awaited and demanded Special Care nursing speciality. This was recognised by RD 992/1987 2 but was repealed in RD 450/2005, 3 when 8 specialties were recognised, with ours being the medical---surgical specialty, still pending development by the national commission.",

This scale measures the amount of work a nurse has per shift and whether it is a more realistic measurement than the nurse:patient ratio. It is validated in our cultural context 5 but is not a widely used scale in today's ICUs for management of nursing staff.",
