Correlations have been made between the dissociation constants for\nSARS-CoV S proteins from the ACE2 receptor and rates of transmissibility, viral infection, and\ndisease severity.1 SARS-CoV-2 S protein may have a lower Kd than\nthe one from SARS-CoV; hence, the virus may have evolved to maximize this interaction.3 To virologists, these structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2-spike\nprotein\u00b7ACE2 interface reveal a potentially important epitope that vaccines might be\nengineered to bind.

            "text": "When COVID-19 enters the mouth there are two immediate destinations: the lungs and the\nintestines. Intestines present about 200 m2 of epithelial cell surface per\nindividual for the virus to work on, but relatively few patients with life-threatening cases\nof COVID-19 infection develop diarrhea; most show only severe respiratory symptoms. This\noutcome seems inconsistent with the fact that ACE2 is abundant on small intestine enterocytes\nas well as lung alveolar epithelial cells. COVID-19 seems to tend to lose the battle waged in\nthe intestines because of defensins. Defensins are a subset of amphiphilic antimicrobial\npeptides of which the abundant HD5 (human defensin 5) is illustrative. In fact, HD5 also plays\na key role in protecting cells in the intestine from the virus, as shown by a group from Third\nMilitary Medical University, Chongqing.7 HD5 is secreted by Paneth cells in\nthe crypts of the small intestine; it is a 32-residue peptide constrained by three disulfide\nbonds (Figure 2). Abundance of HD5 in the intestine\nsuggests that it may effectively compete with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to bind ACE2 even\nthough it has a higher Kd (39.3 nM) than the viral protein (2.68 nM also via BLI;\nKd value slightly different to that quoted above probably due to different\nprotein source and, perhaps, glycosylation state). Modeling indicates HD5 binds the\nN-terminal region of the critical red helix shown in Figure 1, and this is the interaction that\ngives the blocking effect. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein also binds HD5 (Kd, 82 nM)\nthough that interaction does not prevent it binding ACE2. The Chongqing group assayed their\ncompounds by BLI for binding, by immunofluorescence (with and without HD5) of Paneth cells\nexposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds this on the\ncell surface, and by Western blot of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that makes its way into cells.\nAs expected, HD5 suppresses uptake of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into the colon cells, and it is\nin the colon where this defensin is excreted by Paneth cells.",

CR3022 is a\nneutralizing mAb for SARS-CoV (from \u201cSARS\u201d, Kd 1 nM), but it also\nbinds SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Kd 115 nM) in the same region, where the two spike\nproteins are 86% homologous. Six CR3022 turns, three on the light chain and three on the\nheavy, bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Figure 3,\nturns in red), and the region where they bind does not overlap with that\nwhich contacts ACE2. CR3022 neutralizes SARS-CoV but not SARS-CoV-2 (from COVID-19). A\nmechanism of inactivation other than competition for ACE2 must be involved for\nSARS-CoV\u00b7CR3022 that is not applicable to SARS-CoV-2. On that subject the authors note\nthe receptor binding domains of coronaviruses undergo hinge-like transitions between\nup and down conformations (Figure 3b, hinge in blue and CR3022 binding site in red/yellow); only the\nup is accessible to CR3022, and ACE2 only binds to the up\nform. These observations speak to the potential importance of mAbs and eventually small\nmolecules that bind the spike protein, including ones that do not bind the PPI interface.",
