This increased mortality is thought to be due to a skewing of the immune response toward a Th2 response with enhanced eosinophil infiltration. In addition, the production of nonprotective antibodies in response to the FI\u2010RSV vaccine may have been due to poor Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) stimulation.33 In a previous study, we showed that a UV\u2010inactivated SARS\u2010CoV vaccine induced a strong Th2\u2010skewed immune response and that TLR agonists could limit the development of a lung eosinophilic immunopathology.34\n",

Two weeks after the second immunization with the SARS\u2010CoV S protein, the dose\u2010dependency of the antigen\u2010specific IgG production was assessed in all the immunized mice (Figure 2a).

One explanation for the failure to induce protective immune responses could be that structural changes in S protein upon binding to the AuNP adjuvant resulted in S\u2010binding IgGs that were unable to neutralize the virus.58 AuNPs and S protein bind together via electrostatic interactions and S\u2010protein forms a \u201cprotein corona\u201d around AuNPs.59, 60 Indeed, both the DLS and TEM structure analysis indicated that the conjugated S protein on AuNPs formed a protein corona, which is considered to result in structural changes in adsorbed proteins59 for adaptation to the nanoparticle surface and surrounding environment.61 The protein secondary structure is strongly affected by the surface charge of AuNPs.62 The particle surface of a protein corona defines the biological identity of the particle when it is attached to the cell surface in vivo.58, 59 Thus, even a small modification in S protein structure could impact both negatively and positively on its immunogenicity. More work will be required to study the mechanisms and to test whether the AuNP\u2010adjuvanted vaccine is effective against coronavirus infection (i.e., effect of antigen binding methods, antigen against the receptor binding site).",

There were significant differences in the levels of the virus\u2010specific IgG titer in mice immunized with 0.1 \u00b5g of S+AuNP between Figures 4a and 5b. We speculate that the difference could be due to differences in the ages of the mice employed in these experiments.
