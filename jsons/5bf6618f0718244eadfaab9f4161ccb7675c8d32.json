Several studies have used confirmed COVID-19 cases to estimate the growth rate of the pandemic. However, many studies have discussed limitations of including only confirmed cases attributable to the lack of information about testing protocols and testing rates among different countries. Finally, some researchers proposed the analysis of reported deaths by COVID-19 as a potential solution. However, this metric results in biased estimates because deaths by COVID-19 are known to be underreported.",

Additionally, we included testing data in the analysis to assess intra-and inter-country variation in testing growth rates. We hypothesized that the test-positivity rate is an approximation to the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemics in countries with high testing rates. Additionally, we hypothesize that a significant decrease in the pandemic over time could be identified by a significant decrease in the confirmed cases along with a significant decrease in the testpositivity rate. Our results quantified the potential effects of physical distance interventions on the COVID-19 pandemic progression under different levels of testing and enforcement of mitigation policies.",

Such information might not only justify physical isolation policies, but also provide time to adapt or redistribute health care personnel, technology, and services where they are needed the most. These analyses would also provide crucial benchmarks for measuring the impact of potential relaxation of the physical distancing interventions in the coming months of the pandemic. In this study, we evaluated the impact of NPI protocols, including lockdown and physical distancing efforts, to counteract the initial intensity of COVID-19 outbreaks in several countries. We also conducted a counterfactual analysis to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases that would occur if such NPI protocols were not implemented in 12 developed countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa.",

This analysis quantifies significant changing trends in COVID-19 rates (over a 12-day period) from the rates expected in the absence of any enforced interventions, namely physical distancing, stay home orders and lockdowns. Using this method, we simulated changes in the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic from the first to the last dates in which testing data were available by country. Accumulated testing data were included only for the countries with enough daily test information to allow reasonable interpolation. As a result, 12 countries from Europe, Asia, and Africa were included in our analysis: Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, South Africa, South Korea and the United Kingdom. We interpolated testing data for the dates with missing information using a Kalman filter approximation 12 . The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases divided by the corresponding interpolated testing count gave the TPR by day, which were resampled every two days to avoid high variability. Finally, the resulting resampled time series for each country was linearized, and growth rates were obtained using the natural logarithm and the discrete first derivative.",

The counterfactual trend analysis quantifies the differences between the observed COVID-19 growth rates and the (unobservable) growth rates that would have occurred under the absence of physical distancing measures.

Our Bayesian state-space time series analysis constructed counterfactual trends by using the rates before NPI measures were implemented to estimate the alternative outcome without the effect of the intervention. This methodology quantifies the deviation of the time series during the post intervention period from its baseline. This model is valid for short-term predictions, and used default prior distributions in the causal impact model 11 . COVID-19 cases under the counterfactual model were computed from their posterior predictive distributions, and the difference in growth rates between the observed values and the counterfactual estimates were used to identify significant effects of physical distance measures to counteract COVID-19 transmission. The benchmark for significant changes was set to 0.5 standard deviations from the pre-intervention values in order to increase the robustness of results.

Assumptions of our time series analysis include that the temporal trends are stable during the pre and post NPI periods 11 . In our case, this assumption is not completely accurate as the temporal trend was exponential only in the early phase of the pandemic (below 36% of total population infected 16 ). This limits our analysis to short time periods after the implementation of NPI policies. Additionally, the accuracy of TPR as an approximation to COVID-19 incidence decreases if the relationship between TPR and incidence is nonlinear, which in turn would affect our interpretations regarding the impact of NPIs on COVID-19",

However, the effectiveness of NPI measures depends on the level of enforcement and intensity of the implemented interventions, and relaxed low-level enforcement of NPI measures may have a modest or even close to no impact in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic 15 . The results generated in this study could inform guidelines for the next phase of the pandemic in which intermittent physical distancing with different intervention intensity is implemented in several countries. Moreover, testing trends should be considered to assess the temporal dynamics of the pandemic. Analysis of only confirmed cases could distort the results caused by the effects of testing due to the availability of test kits, clinical guidelines, among others. Transparency in the information about testing protocols is required in order to evaluate the real spread of the pandemic and the real effects of the current NPI measures implemented. Figure 1 .

Our results support the analysis of TPR data in combination with time series data on confirmed cases in a country instead of the analysis of confirmed cases alone.We estimate that NPI measures such as physical distancing and lockdowns led to an average reduction of 39% to 65% in the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This effect along with a reduction of23.22 cases per 100 tests suggests that these NPI measures are contributing to flattening the curve of the COVID-19 distribution. The results of the application of these NPI measures are evident in Italy, where the expected number of cases without lockdown was estimated to be 669,813 compared to the observed count of 139,422, and a reduction of 26 cases (expected 43.3, observed 17.3) per 100 tests by April 8 th , 2020. Considering that our results suggest an estimated mortality rate from COVID-19 of 10.68%, physical distancing measures may have contributed to an estimated 73,691 fewer deaths by COVID-19 in Europe alone. On average, NPI measures showed an effect 11.05 days after the first intervention started. However, most of the countries that had a significant decrease in COVID-19 growth rates implemented NPI measures early in the start of the pandemic. This could explain why some countries may have been less impacted by NPI measures according to our trend analysis, particularly those countries that implemented lockdowns later in the time span of our analysis. We also identified countries where the lockdown did not show a significant change in the speed of the propagation of the virus, notably in France where the expected number of cases without physical distancing measures was 98,863 compared to the observed count of 90,848. This result might be linked to the lack of enforcement of the NPI measures by the government. The differences between the observed and expected number of cases across countries suggest that the impact of NPI measures on the spread of COVID-19 is dependent on the level of enforcement and intensity of the implementation of the intervention 7,15 . While countries like Italy, South Korea and Malaysia enforced strict physical distancing measures early in the pandemic, countries such as France and the United Kingdom opted for more relaxed implementation of NPI measures. Many countries are planning to start relaxing the NPI measures they currently have in place, and thus our results are potential indicators of the effectiveness of these interventions and the likely trend of the pandemic under less strict enforcement of physical distancing measures.",

On average, a significant decrease in growth rates of the pandemic was observed 12.33 days after implementation of NPI measures (SD 5.61 days). Significantly decreasing growth rates of COVID-19 after mandating physical distancing were observed in five countries (Austria, Belgium, Italy, Malaysia, and South Korea), with an average reduction of 52.37% (SD 13.37%) in the growth rates of confirmed cases. For these five countries, there was a decrease of 23.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.87 -28.57) cases per 100 tests, after implementation of NPI measures. Conversely, seven countries (Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, South Africa, and the United Kingdom) did not have significant changes in the growth rate of COVID-19 after implementation of NPI measures (controlling for temporal changes in testing rates).",
