We performed a comprehensive investigation of the clinical features of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with or without suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. Aim To explore the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. Methods 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) in the isolation ward of a mental health hospital in Wuhan and 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia (clean group) in the general ward of another mental health hospital in Yichang were recruited. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest CT results before 21 February 2020. We also compared the emotional and mental symptoms between the two groups. results Medical records revealed that 21 COVID-19 suspected patients were transferred to the isolation ward between 30 January 2020 and 15 February 2020. The mean age (SD) of COVID-19 suspected patients was 43.1 (2.6). 12 (57.1%) patients showed abnormalities on chest CT before onset of respiratory symptoms. 14 (66.7%) patients had psychiatric medications adjustment after detection of abnormal chest CT findings. By 21 February, one patient was confirmed to have COVID-19. Even though the remaining 20 (95.2%) were negative for at least two reverse transcription PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases. Compared with patients in the clean group, patients in the suspected COVID-19 group showed significantly higher stress, depression and anxiety levels and poorer sleep quality. Conclusion Setting up an independent isolation ward for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 helped control the spread of the epidemic. Patients with schizophrenia suspected to have COVID-19 showed increased stress and mood and sleep disturbances, which should be appropriately managed.",

Considering the understanding of COVID-19 to date, enormous challenges exist in the management of hospitalised patients with mental disorders. China has issued a series of measures, including triage, infection prevention and control, and treatment, to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic in mental health hospitals. 1 2 Hospitalised patients with mental disorders have emotional disturbances, behavioural disorders and and a history of long-term use of antipsychotic drugs. Physical and psychiatric symptoms of patients with mental disorders may worsen with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to difficulties in treatment and management. We have found no published studies on the clinical features of hospitalised psychiatric patients who have COVID-19. With these challenges in mind, we performed a comprehensive retrospective investigation of the clinical features of 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia who were suspected to have COVID-19 at a mental health hospital in Hubei Province, China. Further, we compared them with 30 clean hospitalised patients with schizophrenia at another mental health hospital in Hubei Province in order to better understand how COVID-19 influenced clinical outcomes.",

Owing to the outbreak of COVID-19, isolation wards were established on 30 January 2020 at one mental health hospital General Psychiatry in Hubei Province. When patients in this mental health hospital showed the onset of respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough and/or new abnormal chest CT findings, they were transferred to the isolation wards as COVID-19 suspected cases. Hospitalised patients with schizophrenia who were suspected to have COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) were recruited from one of the isolation wards at this mental health hospital from 30 January to 21 February 2020. Meanwhile 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia in the general ward who were not suspected to have COVID-19 (clean group) from a mental health hospital in Yichang (also in Hubei Province, 300 km away from Wuhan) were recruited using a convenience sampling method. The two aforementioned hospitals are large psychiatric hospitals in Hubei Province, providing outpatient and inpatient treatment for patients with severe mental illness. Most wards are of the closed type, and inpatients receive medication, psychological rehabilitation and physical therapy (figure 1).",

We believed it was difficult to identify confirmed cases from a large number of suspected cases in the early phase of the outbreak. Identifying COVID-19 infection based on clinical symptoms and chest CT, rather than relying entirely on RT-PCR testing, helped patients receive timely treatment and reduced the risk of exposure among uninfected patients. In this study, only one patient had positive result on the third RT-PCR test, and although the remaining 20 patients were negative for at least two PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases. False-positive results of the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 have been reported due to clinical course, specimen collection and detection process, 8 through which some patients may be underdiagnosed. In this study, some patients had abnormalities on chest CT without respiratory symptoms, and more than half of patients had chest CT findings before the onset of respiratory symptoms. Recent studies have reported patients with chest CT findings who initially had negative results in the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and finally positive results. 9 10 The asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 were not well understood and such cases bring challenges to infection control, 11 12 particularly in places with closed management such as mental health hospitals. Therefore, according to the fifth edition of the guideline on COVID-19 in China (valid from 5-19 February), 13 14 timely centralised isolation of patients with suspected symptoms at that time had positive significance in controlling the spread of the epidemic at the mental health hospital.",

More than half of the patients received increased prescriptions of the types or doses. Meanwhile, psychotherapy and patient education were strengthened. Both respiratory treatment and original psychiatric management should be taken into account for hospitalised patients with schizophrenia who are suspected to have COVID-19. 1 2 Strengthening the assessment of psychiatric symptoms and monitoring biochemical levels were suggested in future treatment. 2 Greater perceived stress and emotions of depression and anxiety were found in the COVID-19 suspected group than in the clean group. Moreover, patients in the COVID-19 suspected group had poorer sleep quality. Transferring to the isolation ward, changes in environment and healthcare workers, and suspected COVID-19 itself could be stressors for patients. 15 Depression, anxiety and poor sleep quality could occur under stress. [16] [17] [18] The lessons learnt from the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola outbreaks indicated that challenges and stress could trigger common mental disorders, including anxiety and depressive disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder, 19 20 which in turn could result in hazards that exceed the consequences of the infection itself. 21 Besides, ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, 22 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which can be found in the central nervous system. [23] [24] [25] Animal studies indicated that RAS is related to stress and mood disorders. 24 25 Whether SARS-CoV-2 could infect the central nervous system and cause affect stress and emotional disturbances or not needs to be investigated. Comprehensive clinical measures should be taken in the isolation ward to help patients cope with these problems.",

First, this was a retrospective study focusing on the clinical characteristics and management of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia who were suspected to have COVID-19, with statistical analysis that was relatively simple. Longitudinal studies focusing on patients with schizophrenia who have COVID-19 are required in the future. Second, patients in the COVID-19 suspected group and clean group were recruited from different hospitals and the assessments were performed by different doctors, which may cause bias. In order to reduce bias, we selected two mental health hospitals with similar scales in Wuhan, and the doctors who performed the assessment of patients were at least attending doctors. Third, follow-up of patients in the COVID-19 suspected group is needed to reveal more details with regard to clinical characteristics.",
