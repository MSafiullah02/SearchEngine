When reporting a case to the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry, providers are asked to report on various medications taken before the patient had COVID-19. Although specific details on individual medications might not have been included in our Comment,1 we report the percentage of cases on a number of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drugs, including antimalarials, on a weekly basis to our website, Twitter account, and mailing list, so these data are widely accessible and regularly updated.",

We also plan to investigate differences in COVID-19 outcomes by a variety of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive medications in upcoming publications.",
