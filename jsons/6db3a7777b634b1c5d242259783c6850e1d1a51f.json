Enrichment is often achieved by leukocyte depletion of infected blood prior to storage. However, leukocyte depletion is difficult in low-resource settings and limits analysis to prospectively-collected samples. As a result, approaches such as selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) are being used to enrich for parasite DNA. However, sWGA has had limited success in generating reliable sequencing data from low parasitaemia samples. In this study, enzymatic digestion with MspJI prior to sWGA and whole genome sequencing was evaluated to determine whether this approach improved genome coverage compared to sWGA alone. The potential of sWGA to cause amplification bias in polyclonal infections was also examined.",

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing has greatly advanced research on malaria parasite genomics. Several molecular epidemiological studies have used genomic approaches in an effort to better understand Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity in relation to malaria transmission, drug resistance and vaccine design [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, a majority of such population genomics studies rely on whole genome sequencing of samples collected in malaria endemic areas. Since patient blood samples contain mostly human DNA, enrichment for parasite DNA is required in order to obtain parasite sequence data with adequate genome coverage. Leukocyte depletion is an effective method for reducing the amount of host DNA for parasite sequencing and hence increase the proportion of parasite DNA prior to sequencing; however, depletion must be performed within hours of sample collection and can be logistically challenging in some resource-limited settings [6, 7] . In addition, once the sample is frozen and cells are lysed, leukocyte depletion is no longer effective, thus limiting the application of this approach to prospectively-collected samples. To reduce the need for extensive sample processing in the field and to enable examination of the wealth of historical samples collected as dried blood spots or whole venous blood, malaria researchers have explored alternative parasite DNA enrichment approaches including enzymatic digestion of human DNA [8] , selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) [9] , and hybrid selection (capture-based method) [10] .",

            "text": "MspJI is a restriction endonuclease that cleaves specific motifs containing methylated cytosines that has been used to selectively digest human DNA prior to parasite DNA sequencing [11] . The success of this approach is based on the assumption of different methylation patterns in the human and parasite genomes; however, methylation patterns in P. falciparum are not fully understood [12] . sWGA of the parasite genome over the human genome has also shown promising results as a method for enrichment of parasite DNA prior to whole genome sequencing. This approach uses multiple displacement amplification with phi29 DNA polymerase using primers binding at greater density in the parasite genome compared to the human genome. Phi29 results in amplification of long DNA fragments and is known to have a low error rate. An existing sWGA protocol has been shown to work best with samples that have parasitaemia greater than ~ 1200 parasites/\u00b5L [9] . While this parasitaemia threshold may allow sequencing of most clinical infections, it limits studies of lower parasitaemia infections, including submicroscopic infections that may significantly contribute to the malaria burden in some areas [13] . In addition, because sWGA primers were designed against the 3D7 reference sequence without consideration of P. falciparum genetic diversity, the potential for differential amplification of particular parasite clones within a polyclonal infection (e.g. those most genetically similar to the reference) is a concern. Since a large proportion of infections from high-transmission areas are polyclonal, the possibility of amplification bias introduced by sWGA warrants further investigation, as such bias could lead to inaccurate inferences in downstream analyses.",

Samples that underwent MspJI digestion had significantly less human (p = 0.028, Mann-Whitney U test) and parasite DNA (p = 0.028, Mann-Whitney U test) compared to the untreated samples. Similarly, MspJI-digested samples also had significantly less human (p = 0.028, Mann-Whitney U test) and parasite DNA (p = 0.028, Mann-Whitney U test) compared to the MspJI \u2212 control (Fig. 1a) .

Further experiments suggested that the vacuum filtration step in the MspJI \u2212 condition (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ) was likely responsible for the improved parasite DNA concentration (Fig. 1b , p-value = 0.028, Mann-Whitney U test), possibly due to removal of small DNA fragments that may lead to non-specific binding.

Further in-depth coverage analysis showed that this pattern was consistent across all chromosomes (Additional file 1: Figure S3A ).

In this study, two published parasite DNA enrichment approaches were combined, namely enzyme digestion of human DNA [8] and sWGA [9] , to determine whether the combined approaches improved the ability to generate high-quality whole genome sequence data from non-leukocytedepleted clinical samples with low parasitaemia. Oyola et al. reported up to ~ 9-fold P. falciparum DNA enrichment resulting in > 98% of the parasite genome with at least 5X coverage when using MspJI digestion only (no . 5 Proportion of isolate-specific SNPs in mixtures that underwent sWGA prior to sequencing or were directly sequenced sWGA) prior to sequencing [8] . However, in this study, enzyme digestion with MspJI resulted in a significant decrease in both human and parasite DNA concentrations, before and after sWGA. This reduced DNA concentration may be due to digestion of both human and parasite DNA, consistent with the presence of a \"smear\" of small DNA fragments observed when digested samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis (data not shown). This finding contrasts with that of Oyola et al. who observed a band representing intact parasite DNA along with digested human DNA following MspJI digestion, although it is notable that the amount of starting DNA (1 \u00b5g total) used in the Oyola study was much larger than that obtained from the dried blood spots in this study, and likely larger than what would be obtained from dried blood spots collected in the field. In addition, Cowell et al. [24] observed no significant difference in genome coverage with digestion using MspJI or FspEI prior to sWGA and sequencing of Plasmodium vivax. However, since MspJI targets specific motifs containing methylated cytosines, and P. vivax has higher GC content than P. falciparum, it is possible that the targeted motifs may be more common in P. vivax, leading to the failure of MspJI in this context. Though MspJI digestion was not successful, further investigation is warranted to identify alternative enzymes that target the human genome over the parasite genome that could potentially perform better and be useful in combination with sWGA. While digestion with MpsJI did not improve parasite DNA concentration, surprisingly, the parasite DNA concentration was significantly greater in the MspJI \u2212 control compared to MspJI and no treatment. Subsequent experiments suggested that this increased DNA concentration resulted from the vacuum filtration step. Indeed, it was discovered that the filtration of extracted DNA prior to sWGA resulted in a greater parasite DNA concentration compared to unfiltered DNA that underwent sWGA. This result may be due to removal of small fragments of parasite DNA that may bind sWGA primers but not lead to effective amplification because of their short length. The increased DNA concentration obtained from the optimized sWGA protocol also resulted in increased genome coverage of whole genome sequencing data, although this increase was most pronounced in lower parasitaemia samples.",

Although statistically significant, the correlation between parasitaemia and percent of the genome with 5X coverage was weak, suggesting that this optimized sWGA approach can be used to obtain highquality whole genome sequence data from low parasitaemia samples. Additional testing of this approach on dried blood spots stored under different environmental conditions and storage times will be required to further characterize which samples are likely to yield successful results using this optimized approach. If the parasite DNA is highly degraded, this optimized approach may not be successful, both because small DNA fragments may be removed during filtration and lead to less effective whole genome amplification and because of a general lack of longer fragments needed for successful sWGA. For more highly degraded samples, capture-based methods of enrichment may yield better results. Amplification bias following sWGA or capture-based parasite DNA enrichment has been largely understudied but is essential to understand given the high prevalence of polyclonal infections in high transmission areas. The potential for amplification bias following sWGA was further explored by comparing whole genome sequence data generated from experimental mixtures of parasite DNA from four culture-adapted parasite isolates from Malawi that were either directly sequenced or underwent sWGA prior to sequencing. Consistent with other studies, genome coverage of sequence data generated from samples that underwent sWGA was more uneven compared to coverage of sequence data generated through direct sequencing, most likely due to the sparse sWGA primer coverage in diverse and AT-rich subtelomeric regions [9, 25] . However, per base reference allele frequencies within the core genome were highly correlated both within and between the sWGA and directly-sequenced groups, suggesting that sWGA is not substantially biasing allele frequencies. Experimental mixtures that underwent sWGA had significantly higher estimates of F ws , implying some loss of within-mixture diversity. This result is in agreement with the results of Cowell et al. [24] who found reduced estimates of infection complexity following sWGA of P. vivax DNA, based on analysis of both sequence data and microsatellites, and may be explained by differences in genome coverage between groups. Indeed, directly sequenced samples had higher genome coverage than samples that underwent sWGA, even in the core genome. To test this hypothesis, F WS was estimated based only on SNPs called in both the sWGA samples and the directly sequenced samples and no significant difference in F WS was observed between groups, suggesting the lower diversity in samples that underwent sWGA was not the result of amplification bias favouring some isolates over others. This conclusion is also supported by the lack of significant differences in the proportion of isolate-specific variants between the sWGA and directly sequenced isolates. More in-depth analysis will be required to evaluate which genomic regions have reduced coverage in sWGA samples and the implications for downstream analyses.",
