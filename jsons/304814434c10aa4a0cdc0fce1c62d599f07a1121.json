            "text": "Targeted RNA recombination has proven to be a powerful tool for the genetic engineering of the coronavirus genome, particularly in its 3 part. Here we describe procedures for the generation of recombinant and mutant mouse hepatitis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus. Key to the two-step method is the efficient selection of recombinant viruses based on host cell switching. The first step consists of the preparation-using this selection principle-of an interspecies chimeric coronavirus. In this virus the ectodomain of the spike glycoprotein is replaced by that of a coronavirus with a different species tropism. In the second step this chimeric virus is used as the recipient for recombination with synthetic donor RNA carrying the original spike gene. Recombinant viruses are then isolated on the basis of their regained natural (e.g., murine or feline) cell tropism. Additional mutations created in the donor RNA can be co-incorporated into the recombinant virus in order to generate mutant viruses.",

            "text": "Targeted RNA recombination was the first reverse genetics method developed to introduce mutations into the coronavirus genome [for a recent review, see (1)]. Actually, its first demonstration involved the repair of an 87-nucleotide deletion in the N gene of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) by recombination with a synthetic donor RNA equivalent to the subgenomic mRNA for the wild-type N gene (2). Recombinant virus was selected by its increased temperature stability and efficient growth at the nonpermissive temperature, a tedious process. The frequency of RNA recombination and hence the ease with which recombinant viruses could be isolated was subsequently improved by the use of defective interfering (DI) RNAs as donors, i.e., RNA constructs consisting of sequences derived from the 5 and 3 terminal parts of the MHV genome (3,4) . Yet, selection of mutant viruses remained the Achilles' heel of the method, particularly when one was seeking to construct temperaturesensitive or otherwise crippled mutants. Hence, the approach did not become common practice.",

With the use of virus-like particles it was shown that this process is governed by the spike (S) protein's carboxy-terminal region, comprising the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (5). Spikes were still incorporated into virus-like particles after replacement of their ectodomain by that of another coronavirus. Such chimeric spikes also retained their biological functions-receptor binding and membrane fusion-as judged by their ability to cause cell-cell fusion. Given the generally strict species-specific nature of coronaviruses in tissue culture these features enabled the design of a powerful positive selection strategy based on interspecies chimeric coronaviruses, as was first described for MHV (6).",

            "text": "Here we describe the detailed procedures for the method of targeted RNA recombination using this strategy of host cell switching. Protocols are presented for MHV and FIPV (feline infectious peritonitis virus) as examples. For any given virus the procedure starts with the generation of an interspecies chimeric coronavirus. Thus, a donor DI RNA is prepared containing a chimeric S gene. Cells are infected with the virus in question and additionally transfected with the donor RNA. In such cells homologous recombination of the donor RNA with viral genomic RNA can give rise to the formation and release of chimeric virus. This chimeric virus is subsequently selected by passing the culture supernatant onto cells that are infectable only by the virus from which the chimeric S protein ectodomain was derived. Felinized MHV (fMHV) and murinized FIPV (mFIPV) are thus the chimeric viruses described in the examples; they are isolated and grown in feline and murine cells, respectively. The chimeric viruses subsequently function as the recipients for the second round of homologous recombination designed to regenerate the original virus or to obtain mutants thereof. Donor DI RNA is again prepared that now contains the original wildtype S gene, plus any additional intended mutations. In cells infected with the chimeric virus, recombination with this RNA can lead to formation of (mutants of) the original virus, which can now, in turn, be isolated by passing the collection of progeny viruses onto its natural cells. A schematic outline of the latter recombination process is depicted in Fig. 1 .",
