Patients undergoing EM face a multitude of emotional, cognitive and physical challenges: cognitive impairment affecting their ability to follow directions, generalized weakness, and their attachment to monitoring devices [3, 4]. Nevertheless, even in this setting, early mobility has been demonstrated to attenuate ICU-acquired weakness, improve functional recovery, reduce the incidence and duration of delirium, ventilator days and ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and decrease hospital costs [2, 5, 6].",

Critically ill patients with cancer experience additional challenges, resulting from disease symptoms and treatment-related side effects, which adversely impacts their quality of life [7]. Previous studies of EM in critically ill patients mostly derived from the perspective of health care providers and have focused primarily on its safety, feasibility, barriers, and perceived benefits [8\u201311]. A few studies have addressed patient and family perceptions of physical therapy, a key component of EM; however, these studies were limited to patients in the outpatient arena or focused on survivors of critical illness [12\u201314]. Only one study has dealt with patient and family perceptions of PT in the ICU. Participants in this study completed a survey at the end of 28 days of PT or at hospital discharge [15]. Interpreting such a study is problematic because the factual memory of patients recalling ICU stay events varies greatly during and after critical illness [16].",

Patients exhibiting severe altered mental status, elevated intracranial pressure, non-secure or difficult airway, active myocardial ischemia, hemodynamic instability, active gastrointestinal blood loss, or open abdomen are excluded. All potential EM patients are cleared and approved by the intensivist-led ICU teams. Once cleared, the patients undergo a comprehensive assessment followed by a series of physical and cognitive EM exercises as determined and instructed by the PT and OT staff. These activities include the following: (1) in bed activities such as passive and active range of motion exercises; (2) use of iPad in bed; (3) seated edge of bed activities including self-care, postural correction/control, and active range of motion; (4) sit to stand, and transfer training to chair or commode; and (5) standing exercises and gait training. The bedside RN, RT, and other adjunctive staff monitor the patients\u2019 vital signs, cardiovascular and respiratory status, level of comfort, and tolerance to these activities [7]. In addition, they mitigate mishaps by securing endotracheal, nasogastric and/or thoracic tubes, as well as abdominal/pelvic, urinary and/or vascular catheters.",

A pilot of the survey was administered to 5 patients, who provided the following feedback: (1) the questions were easy to read and understand; (2) questions eliciting patient feelings were welcomed [questions 9\u201312]; and (3) a simplified definition for early mobility was requested.
