Biological agents stimulate terror in the affected population because they cause injury and death in strange and prolonged ways. Biological weapons are nearly as easy to develop, far more lethal, and easier to deliver than chemical weapons and, unlike nuclear weapons, they are inexpensive to produce and the risk of detection is low. Progress in molecular biology has made fast and easy biotoxin production possible. Biological weapons may act on many different targets, can be disseminated by food and water, by insect vectors, or by aerosol, may have many means to penetrate targets and may be used by low-qualified terrorists. Considering these facts, it becomes obvious that it is practically impossible to make a unique doctrine for each possible threat. Improvement will not easily occur by investing money in established paradigms of public health; rather than that, a new, more effective, all-inclusive epidemiological model of bioterrorism attack must be introduced.",

If we carefully consider recent experiences from natural epidemics (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], avian influenza) and biological attack (USA anthrax attack, 2001), two types of epidemic specific to biological attack can be recognized: the epidemic of infectious disease and the epidemic of fear and panic. The US anthrax bioterrorism attack in 2001, when letters containing Bacillus anthracis were sent within the country, showed the real dimensions of the epidemic of fear and panic. In total, 22 persons were diagnosed with B. anthracis infection of whom five died, over 32 000 people were treated with antibiotics and a tremendous epidemic of panic and fear overwhelmed the whole population. In the aftermath, a large number of letters, approximately 12 000, with suspect contents were discovered in the USA, as well as 7622 harmless letters across Europe, as imitations of the real attack.6, 7 They amplified and expanded the epidemic of panic and fear, giving it characteristics of pandemic.",

In the light of the \u2018global environment\u2019, the new epidemiologic paradigm of bioterrorism attack is proposed. This model was created by merging two triangle chain models (epidemic of infectious disease and epidemic of fear and panic). The new model has the form of a four-sided pyramid. It shows the main components of these processes, their mutual relationships and possible inter-reactions. The cornerstones of that pyramid are: agent, information, local environment and global environment. They are in mutual inter-reactions and in inter-reaction with the host, which is on the top of the pyramid (Fig. 2\n). The new four-sided pyramidal epidemiological model should present perplexing events and relationships before, during and after biological attack. This epidemiologic pyramid could also serve as a practical model for the planning and implementation of intervention measures.",

However, the question of how to solve and simplify so many suggested anti-attack measures remains. We have tried to define and classify them. The answer would be to apply several levels of prevention. Four levels of prevention were defined according to demands related to biological attack, and preventive measures were attributed to each of them. As presented in Fig. 2, the four levels of prevention are spherical systems. This shape was applied to ensure easier, apprehensible and simpler overviews both for health and safety professionals and for the public. Also, spherical systems indicate numerous prevention measures within each prevention level and at the same time reduce possible confusion and duplication of selection of preventive measures. Finally, spherical systems clearly indicate (1) which components (represented as cornerstones of the pyramid) should be protected at any phase of the biological attack (components inside of that sphere), and (2) which components (components outside of that sphere) should be addressed by intervention measures.",

Secondary prevention activities should be addressed promptly, effectively, and should be directed to breaking both the epidemic of infectious disease and the epidemic of fear and panic.

One of the first mental effects is intense social and psychological distress, especially fear of biological agents, even when they are not used. There are several reasons for this reaction: the invisibility of biological agents, the possibility that the agent can be spread by personal contact, the uncertainty of the extent of dangerousness of biological weapons, etc. On the other hand, the exposure to any severe stressor\u2014whether natural or man-made\u2014is a risk factor for a range of long-term social and mental problems. Social problems emerging after exposure to biological agents, including population displacement, breakdown of community support systems, and social stigma associated with contagion or contamination, may further contribute to the phenomenon of mass psychogenic illness.8, 9\n",

It helps us observe the differences between these two types of epidemics in order to prepare intervention measures. The epidemic of fear and panic can be divided into three phases (Fig. 3). The first is the anticipation phase that encounters fear, anxiety, and a possible lower level of panic and somatization at the individual and community level. The presence of these phenomena depends on the seriousness of the threat, any recent terrorist attack in the same or a close territory, awareness of community vulnerability, etc. Medical workers summoned in response teams and exposed to affected (or presumed affected) patients may become anxious, ambivalent and try to avoid contact with patients. Such patterns of behaviour may have a demoralizing effect, and should be treated by providing relevant information (contagiousness of agent) and by implementing appropriate means of protection (protective clothing, vaccinations). Primordial and primary levels of prevention should comprise activities designed to mitigate the anticipation phase of the epidemic of fear and panic.",

Also, the immediate attention of mental health workers should be paid to the possibility of direct consequences of the biological agents.

Such a community is more susceptible and vulnerable to harmless threats and to the consecutive development of panic and chaos. This is a period for full tertiary prevention action. Actions should be two-dimensional, i.e., they should be handled in two directions: toward the reduction of fear and panic and toward shortening of this period (Fig. 3).

Indirect effects comprise medical, social, economic and legal consequences that follow months to years afterwards. The long-term effects can be substantial in the case of biological attack. Experience indicates that following a biological attack there would be three major health concerns: (1) chronic harm and diseases directly caused by the agent, (2) psychological effects, and (3) increased levels of somatic symptoms.21 A population exposed to biological attack experiences direct chronic disease/harm depending on the nature of the agent. The psychological casualties of a bioterrorism event will likely far outnumber all other medical casualties.25 Anticipated psychological consequences include distress responses, such as insomnia, phobias, fear, and the feeling of vulnerability.26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 Furthermore, behavioural changes\u2014social withdrawal, acting out, and increased consumption of nicotine, alcohol or drugs\u2014can be one of the responses to the attack.28, 29 Finally, psychiatric/psychological symptoms, such as sadness, irritability, dissociation, the occurrence of psychosomatic symptoms, and psychiatric illnesses such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are expected.30, 31, 32\n",
