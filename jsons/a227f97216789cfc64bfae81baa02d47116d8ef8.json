Priority was defined based on current and estimated future public health relevance, and potential for safe and cost-effective treatment. The WHO core EML includes some products that were not modelled here due to data limitations, for example, some medicines for cancer, advanced cardiovascular care and hepatitis. For many of these conditions, global burden of disease data cannot be used to estimate demand for medicines as there is a complex progression through therapy options, based on an individual's pathology. Additionally, since some of the products are new, there are limited pastuse data from LMICs. Furthermore the prices for some of these products are likely to change significantly in the future as the markets are nascent and evolving.

For medicines without a DDD, we defined a dosing unit based on the functional unit; for example, a 5 milligram suppository was assumed to have a dose of 5 milligrams per day. However, when data from IMS Health were incorporated in the analysis (see below), the IMS Standard Unit was used: the functional unit as described above for oral solids, suppositories and vials; for liquids, a quantity of 5 millilitres (thus a 100 millilitre bottle of suspension would include 20 doses of a medicine).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Creating the list of medicines"}, {"text": "We applied an overall decision rule to estimate quantity required per medicine.

This dataset thus captures all public sector medicine purchases in this province for a 12-month period. The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) data are reported as quantity procured per item (an item is defined as a medicine with a defined strength and dosage form). These were converted into milligrams (based on strength, pack size and quantity procured), and divided by the WHO DDD for this item (to calculate the DDD procured per year) and then by the midyear KZN population size (to calculate the DDD per person per year). \uf0b7 Second, we used data from the Denmark Medstat database (http://medstat.dk/en), which includes data from the Register of Medicinal Product Statistics and the Danish State Serum Institute about all medicines sold to individuals (via pharmacies and non-pharmacy outlets), as well as to primary health facilities and hospitals. We used the most recent data available (2014). Most Denmark data were reported as DDD per 1000 people per day, so these were arithmetically scaled to the DDD per person per year; for those reported as packs, items, or quantity (litres or millilitres) per 1000 people per day, these were converted as appropriate to the unit in which price was available for this item. \uf0b7 Lastly, IMS data were used from four LMICs: Hungary, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey. Data for 2014 were used. In these countries IMS collects data from ambulatory and hospital channels. Supplies to military hospitals and prisons are excluded except in Thailand where military hospitals are included in the sampling frame. Data are generally collected on a sample basis and projected based on geography and supply chain characteristics (for example type of specialty or size of a hospital). South Africa hospital and Turkish hospital data are not projected. South African hospital data reflects sales information from 5 of the 8 largest provinces, in Turkey coverage is estimated at 94% and 97% respectively. Information on the accuracy of the audits, and the methods used to validate the data can be found at http://www.imshealth.com/en/acts.

We made the assumption that, in a hypothetical clinical scenario wherein only the listed item was available, its consumption would be equal to the summed consumption of all these substitute medicines. Using this comprehensive substitution matrix, we identified the consumption of all substitutes, converted these to DDDs as described above, and added these together to estimate the total consumption for each medicine on our list in DDDs.

We assumed that split between different lines of treatment are similar across populations. Because this model was taking a normative costing approach, and assuming very low barriers to access to medicines and services, we felt more confident in making this assumption. We also conducted literature reviews to support our assumptions about treatment coverage and how patients divide across treatment lines, and we primarily incorporated data from higher-income settings where such barriers would likely be lowered. \uf0b7 Third, there are many assumptions embedded in the demand forecasts used here -for example, whether constraints in diagnosis may in fact lead to under-estimates of the number of people with each disease; and that certain historic behaviors (such as countries' preferences for procurement of different triple fixed-dose combinations) would continue into the future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Appendix 1.3: Assumptions"}, {"text": "Additionally, there were assumptions incorporated within the ARV demand forecasts: \uf0b7 The total number of people on treatment was assumed to be 28.7 million adults and 2.3 million children.

Governments grant patents to innovators as a reward for an innovation when it is useful, new, non-obvious, and described in a manner that people of skill in the relevant field can understand. A patent holder can prevent others from using the innovation for a defined period, and thus recoup investments. Society can then benefit from the disclosure of the innovation and its wider application.However, patents are often granted at a stage when little is known about the medical usefulness of a product, and patents are awarded irrespective of whether the innovation is important or trivial. Patents can also hamper innovation by excluding others from doing research on the patented subject matter or from accessing research tools.With the creation of World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994 and the accompanying Agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Right (TRIPS), the patent-based innovation system became globalised. TRIPS sets global minimum requirements for the creation and protection of intellectual property (IP), enforceable through WTO, thus introducing medicines patents in many countries that had not previously granted them. Since the adoption of TRIPS, regional and bilateral trade agreements have further expanded the reach of the IP-based system (see below).A company that holds a patent has a de facto monopoly for a certain period of time because no-one else can bring the patented product to market, unless authorised by the patent holder or the government. The price of a patented product can be set by the patent holder and usually far exceeds the actual cost of production. For example, the cost of production of the 12-week hepatitis C treatment with sofosbuvir is estimated at between US$ 68 and US$ 136 1 , while the company sells it in the US for up to US$ 84 000. 2 South Africa pays over US$ 3227 per patient per month for branded imatinib, while in India, where the product is not patented, the generic equivalent is priced at US$ 170 per patient per month. 3 Flexibilities in patent law enabled by the TRIPS Agreement and the WTO Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health of 2001 have been used by a number of countries to secure access to generic medicines. The most frequently deployed flexibilities are compulsory licensing of medicines, government use of patents, and the \"LDC waiver\" which grants Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) the right to not grant or enforce medicines patents and test data protection until 2033.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1959, "end": 1960, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2155, "end": 2156, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "The plethora of trade agreements containing TRIPS-plus provisions that have been concluded in the last decade, including after the adoption of the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, are a serious threat to the policy space TRIPS flexibility provides. The US and the EU are systematically seeking higher levels of IP protection in agreements with countries, which affect access to medicines and seriously hamper the full implementation of the Doha Declaration. This is a failure of State parties to take into account their human rights obligations regarding the right to health when entering into bilateral or multilateral agreements with other states. 4 The following \"TRIPS-plus\" provisions regularly feature in trade agreements and form part of the negotiating objectives of the US and/or the EU in trade talks. All of these TRIPS-plus features can delay the introductions of generic medicines and thereby affect access to medicines: \uf0b7 Patent linkage: prohibits granting of marketing approval by national medicines regulatory authorities during the patent term without the consent of the patent holder, creating a new function for health authorities in the enforcement of patents on medicines; \uf0b7 Data exclusivity: prohibits for a certain period of time the use of pharmaceutical test data for medicines regulatory purposes. This delays registration of generics and biosimilars regardless of the patent status of the product; \uf0b7 Extension of the patent term: extending the patent term for pharmaceuticals beyond the 20 years required by the TRIPS Agreement; 5 \uf0b7 Extension of the scope of patent protection: allowing patens on known substances for each \"new use\";", "cite_spans": [{"start": 662, "end": 663, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Free trade agreements restrict access to generic medicines"}, {"text": "Public Health which says that countries are free to determine the grounds for CL; \uf0b7 Restrictions to parallel importation: importation without the consent of the patent holder is specifically allowed under WTO rules.Some or all of these provisions appear in concluded agreements, such as the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), 6 The drive for ever-higher levels of IP protection through trade agreements should be stemmed and will likely require intervention at the multilateral level. International access to medicines policies have always benefitted from more inclusive, multilateral negotiations where the needs of LMICs take a more central place.
