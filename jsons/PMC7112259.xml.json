Daily symptoms were recorded as composite dichotomized scores (yes/no) each day (ie, the parents were taught to make a global assessment). The complexity of symptoms was detailed in a book that was given to the parents (www.copsac.com/content/literature-parents).

In line with our findings, another birth cohort study reported that respiratory tract infections with RSV and rhinovirus in the first year of life were associated with wheeze and asthma by age 5 years, with no statistically significant difference between the 2 viruses.24 We have previously shown that pathogenic bacteria are associated with wheezing episodes in young children.8 Similar to our finding for viruses, it did not seem to determine the long-term course of asthma if the episodes were triggered by bacteria.

There is a significant body of work published on the association between particularly RSV2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and more recently rhinovirus7 and later development of asthma. On the other hand, predisposition to asthma was associated with increased risk of lower respiratory tract infection and RSV bronchiolitis, the intermediary phenotype associated with asthma.25 Furthermore, early wheezy symptoms were found to be a strong risk factor for subsequent RSV-related hospitalization.26 Recently, we demonstrated that children with acute severe virus-induced bronchiolitis were born with increased bronchial responsiveness compared with children without bronchiolitis27 and that allergic sensitization was a risk factor for rhinovirus-induced wheezing.28 The present study does not support causal effects of specific viruses: for a given number of respiratory episodes it did not influence the risk of asthma whether any of these, or how many of these, were triggered by a specific virus. A differential risk from different virus types during acute episodes could be interpreted in support of a causal effect from certain viruses. However, our study did not support this observation. Similar to other observational studies, we cannot draw any conclusions on causality of early respiratory tract infections on later asthma from this study. It has been reported that timing of birth in relation to the yearly peak in viral respiratory tract infections was associated with later asthma in support of a causal role of early respiratory infections.29 A causal role can only be proved in interventional studies showing that removing the virus or preventing infection changes the risk of subsequent asthma. A recent randomized trial of mAbs against RSV demonstrated a protective effect against wheeze in the first year of life and also after the end of treatment, and further follow-up will provide information on the causal role of early RSV infection on asthma.30 Our results showing a nondifferential response to different viral infections would suggest that a potential causal effect on asthma would not be restricted to RSV infections.",

In particular, we saw no difference in asthma risk associated with rhinovirus or RSV. This suggests that the susceptibility and response to early respiratory tract infections in general, rather than the specific triggering agent, should be the target of future research.Key messages\n\u2022Early respiratory infections are associated with later asthma, and this has led to a focus on a potential causal role of specific viral triggers, particularly rhinoviruses and RSV.\u2022In this study, the number of early respiratory episodes was associated with asthma, irrespective of virus type.\u2022This suggests that future research should focus on the susceptibility and response to lower respiratory tract infections in general rather than the specific triggering agent.\n\n",
