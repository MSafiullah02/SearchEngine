In April 2016, there were more than 120,000 waiting list candidates and just over 1000 donors.2 According to the United Network for Organ Sharing website, solid organs in most demand are kidneys, with more than 100,000 patients on the waiting list, closely followed by almost 15,000 people waiting for livers.2 There are approximately 4000 candidates waiting for a heart transplant and a little over 1000 candidates waiting for lung and pancreas transplants.2 The number of donors for kidney and liver transplantation has increased over the past 5 years, possibly owing to increased living donor transplants. Five-year survival rates for kidney transplant recipients are roughly 75% and for liver transplant recipients it is around 70%.3 Transplant recipients are at risk of complications related to surgical procedures, immunosuppressive therapy, and infection.4 Infection remains the most common complication after SOT.1, 4, 5 This article discusses infections in SOT recipients including those with kidney, heart, lungs, and pancreas transplants.",
