The specific animal host reservoir remains unknown although horseshoe bats are reservoirs of coronaviruses.\u2022SARS is caused by SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which first emerged in China and gained global notoriety in 2002 to 2003 causing a travel-related global outbreak with 8098 cases and 774 deaths. Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV was common.\u2022The main mode of transmission of SARS-CoV is person-to-person spread through inhalation of respiratory droplets. Feco-oral transmission via contaminated fomite on surfaces has been recorded.\u2022Fever and respiratory symptoms, such as influenza predominate, and diarrhea is common. About 25% of cases can rapidly progress and require intensive care.\u2022Treatment involves supportive care with appropriate fluid and electrolyte balance, oxygenation, and organ support. Convalescent plasma, protease inhibitors, and interferon might confer beneficial effects.\u2022Prevention requires strict infection control procedures, with respiratory and contact precautions for routine care, but upgrade to airborne precaution is needed for managing aerosol-generating procedures.\n\n",

These manifest with mild symptoms like the common cold in adults and with more severe disease in infants, the elderly, and the immunosuppressed. In November 2002, unusual cases of \u201catypical pneumonia\u201d of unknown cause occurred in Foshan City, Guangdong province, in China, where many health care workers became infected.1 The infection was brought to Hong Kong on February 21, 2003, by a physician who had looked after similar cases of atypical pneumonia in mainland China, leading to subsequent outbreaks of severe pneumonia in Hong Kong and labeled by WHO as \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d on March 15, 2003.3, 4, 5 Several months elapsed and several hundred cases of SARS were observed before SARS-CoV was identified. A novel \u03b2 CoV (SARS-CoV) of lineage B was confirmed as the cause of the atypical pneumonia cases on March 22, 2003.4 The SARS-CoV epidemic spread to 29 countries and regions, and it was evident that the global public health, medical, and scientific communities were not adequately prepared for the emergence of SARS. Chains of human-to-human transmission occurred in Toronto in Canada, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Chinese Taipei, Singapore, and Hanoi, Viet Nam. The history of the SARS epidemic was short and WHO declared the end of the SARS epidemic in July 2003. There were a total of 8096 SARS cases (which included 774 deaths)4 reported from 29 countries and regions.5\nFig. 1\nshows the geographic map of distribution of SARS cases.",

ACE2 may contribute to the development of DAD. SARS-CoV infections and the S glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV could reduce ACE2 expression. In the mouse model, injection of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein worsened acute lung injury (ALI) in vivo that could be reduced by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway.25 In addition, overexpression of SARS-CoV proteins such as 3a and 7a, which were expressed in the lungs and intestinal tissues of patients with SARS, could induce apoptosis in vitro.26, 27\n",

This delayed IFN-I signaling was thought to promote the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages, leading to elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels, vascular leakage, and impaired virus-specific T-cell responses, whereas genetic ablation of the IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 receptor or inflammatory monocyte-macrophage depletion protected mice from fatal infection, without affecting viral load.36\n",

In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, with marked weight loss, more pathologic conditions of the lung, higher viral titers, impaired lung function, and mortality. In TRIF(\u2212/\u2212) mice infected with SARS-CoV, distinct changes in inflammation occurred including excess infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory cells that correlated with increased pathologic conditions of other known causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Aberrant proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and INF-stimulated gene signaling programs were observed following infection of TRIF(\u2212/\u2212) mice that resembled those seen in human patients with poor clinical outcome following SARS-CoV infection. These findings suggest the importance of TLR adaptor signaling in generating a balanced protective innate immune response to highly pathogenic CoV infections.37 In addition, SARS-CoV M protein may function as a cytosolic pathogen-associated molecular pattern to stimulate IFN-\u03b2 production by activating a TLR-related TRAF3-independent signaling cascade.38\n",

Interestingly, the sera of patients who had succumbed to SARS-CoV infection enhanced SARS-CoV-induced MCP1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of the Fc-\u03b3 receptor reduced such effects.

He warned medical staff that he might have contracted a \u201cvery virulent disease,\u201d with onset of symptoms on February 15, 2003.\nFebruary 26, 2003\u2022A 48-year-old Chinese-American businessman was admitted to the French Hospital in Hanoi with a 3-day history of fever and respiratory symptoms. He traveled to Hong Kong on February 17, departed for Hanoi on February 23, and fell ill there. Shortly before his departure from Hong Kong, he had stayed on the ninth floor of the Hotel M, in a room across the hall from the Guangdong doctor.\nMarch 1, 2003\u2022A 26-year-old woman was admitted to a hospital in Singapore with respiratory symptoms. A resident of Singapore, she was a guest on the ninth floor of the Hotel M in Hong Kong from February 21 to 25.\nMarch 4, 2003\u2022The Guangdong doctor died of atypical pneumonia at Kwong Wah Hospital in Hong Kong.\nMarch 5, 2003\u2022In Hanoi, the Chinese-American businessman, in a stable but critical condition, was air medevaced to the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong. Seven health care workers who had cared for him in Hanoi became ill.\u2022A 78-year-old Toronto woman, who had checked out of the Hotel M in Hong Kong on February 23, died at Toronto\u2019s Scarborough Grace Hospital. Five members of her family were infected and admitted to the hospital. Her son, aged 43, fell ill on February 27, 2003, and was subsequently admitted to a community hospital on March 7, 2003, leading to a major nosocomial outbreak. Subsequent chains of disease transmissions resulted in numerous hospital outbreaks that involved 257 people.\nMarch 7, 2003\u2022Health care workers at Hong Kong\u2019s Prince of Wales Hospital started to complain of respiratory tract infection, progressing to pneumonia. All had an identifiable link with ward 8A.\nMarch 8, 2003\u2022In Taiwan, the source of SARS-CoV infection was a 54-year-old merchant who returned to Taipei via Hong Kong after visiting Guangdong on February 5, 2003. By February 25, 2003, he had developed fever, myalgia, and dry cough but was not hospitalized until March 8, 2003.\nMarch 12, 2003\u2022WHO issued a global alert about cases of severe atypical pneumonia following mounting reports of spread among staff at hospitals in Hong Kong and Hanoi.\u2022At the French Hospital in Hanoi, 26 staff had symptoms. Of these, 25 had either pneumonia or acute respiratory syndrome, and 5 were in critical condition. The hospital was closed to new admissions.\u2022Hong Kong health authorities formally reported an outbreak of an unidentified flu-like illness among hospital staff at the Prince of Wales Hospital. As of midnight March 11, 50 health care workers had been screened; 23 were found to have febrile illness, and 8 showed early chest radiographic signs of pneumonia. A 26-year-old man, who had visited an acquaintance staying on the ninth floor of the Hotel M from February 15 to 23, was shown to be the source of this hospital outbreak following subsequent epidemiologic investigation.\nMarch 13, 2003\u2022The Ministry of Health in Singapore reported 3 cases of atypical pneumonia in young women who had recently returned to Singapore after traveling to Hong Kong. All had stayed on the ninth floor of the Hotel M in late February.\nMarch 15, 2003\u2022WHO issued a travel advisory as evidence mounted that SARS was spreading by air travel along international routes. WHO named the mysterious illness after its symptoms: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and declared it \u201ca worldwide health threat.\u201d\nMarch 26, 2003\u2022The arrival of an infected resident of the Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong to Taiwan on March 26, 2003, led to an escalation of SARS-CoV cases in Taiwan from mid-April 2003. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of both Taiwan and Hong Kong outbreaks revealed the same strain of virus.\nApril 28, 2003\u2022In Hanoi, there was a reported total of 63 cases of SARS-CoV infection before the outbreak was declared to be over on April 28, 2003\nMay 5, 2003\u2022The SARS-CoV outbreak in Singapore was characterized by rapid nosocomial transmission involving a large number of health care workers (97 out of 238 probable SARS cases [41%]) and several super-spreading events. Transmission of SARS was finally brought to an end, with no new cases after May 5, 2003.\nMay 14, 2003\u2022Toronto was initially removed from the WHO list of areas with recent local SARS transmission and there was a province-wide scaling back of SARS control measures, such as fever surveillance and monitoring of respiratory symptoms in existing in-patients and visitors. However, 1 month after the SARS-CoV outbreak was thought to have ended, another surge of cases arose in a Toronto rehabilitation hospital involving health care workers, visitors, and patients who had been exposed to hospitalized patients with undiagnosed SARS-CoV infection.\nJuly 2, 2003\u2022Toronto was finally free from local transmission.\n5 July, 2003\u2022It was finally announced by WHO that the transmission chain of SARS-CoV in Taiwan was broken, bringing an end to the SARS-CoV epidemic.\n\nFrom WHO.

A single negative test in an upper respiratory specimen does not rule out the diagnosis. Because viral kinetics demonstrated an inverted V-shape curve peaking on day 10 of illness with progressive decrease in rates of viral shedding from nasopharynx, stool, and urine (which might persist up to day 21), clinical progression during the second week was thought to be related to immune-mediated lung injury.32\n",

In the event of a late detection of a nosocomial outbreak, hospital closure is required to contain onward disease transmission. However, outbreaks that are detected early and limited to few patients, may be managed by isolating the infected patients in place or, alternatively, relocating the affected patients to a designated location. Early case detection followed by isolation should ideally be performed in negative pressure isolation rooms if available. Implementing droplet precautions and contact precautions seemed adequate to reduce the risk of infection after general exposure to patients with mild SARS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions (hand hygiene, gown, gloves, N95 masks, and eye protection) should be implemented if aerosol-generating procedures are to be undertaken.100\n",
