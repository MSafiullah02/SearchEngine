(2) Are there seasonal variations present in globally reported MERS-CoV cases over time and how do they affect the series? (3) What are the contributions of various risk factors for MERS-CoV cases?",

Although a survey of the literature shows a rapid increase in research activities related to MERS-CoV [1], yet there is still a general paucity of empirical literature examining trends and seasonality. To the best of our knowledge, there is a single study, which anecdotally examined seasonality and time series patterns of MERS-CoV to date [2]. Given MERS-CoV remains a potential pandemic disease globally, it is important to understand the dynamics of the underlying growth or trend of the globally reported cases.",

MERS-CoV is a virus that causes severe viral pneumonia in humans, known to have a high mortality rate [3\u20137] and has clinical symptoms similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [8, 9]. It was first reported in Saudi Arabia [10] and after that, the virus exhibited outbreaks in several regions of the world, particularly Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea [10, 11]. Additionally, the complexity of MERS-CoV and its diagnosis of infection have been acknowledged in the literature [12, 13]. According to WHO, 2160 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported at the end of January 2018, including 773 associated deaths (case\u2013fatality rate: 35.8%) that were reported globally [14]. The majority of these cases were reported in Saudi Arabia.",

Similarly, after adjusting for the trend, cases in Quarter 2 (Q2) averaged around 16 cases more than Q4 cases. Quarter 3 (Q3) cases averaged 19 cases more than Q4 cases after accounting for the trend component time. It is important to note that the effects of seasonality were not statistically significant. However, what was revealed statistically significant is the negative trend. Consistent with the negative trend shown in Figure 1, the regression results revealed that each additional quarter registered approximately an average decrease of one case, after adjusting for the season. In other words, the MERS-CoV cases decreased, on average, by four (4 \u00d7 \u22120.8667627) per quarter year to year.

Even then, our analysis showed that, unlike the trend component, seasonality did not affect the series over time. Many risk factors are associated with MERS-CoV cases, mortalities, or complications. Our results indicate those aged under 30 years (reference category) are less likely to be a MERS-CoV case than those aged over 30, consistent with several studies that associated MERS-COV with elderly patients [15, 16]. Surprisingly, comorbidity did not show a statistically significant contribution to MERS-CoV cases. However, there are studies that showed MERS-CoV cases were associated with patients with comorbidities [17\u201319]. A recent systematic study, for example, suggests the prevalence of comorbidities of MERS-CoV cases, diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases [20]. While our analysis suggests males contribute to the global reported MERS-CoV cases, gender was reported to have a mixed effect on MERS-CoV mortalities in the literature. Some studies showed men as high risk [7, 18] and MERS-CoV infects more males than females [5, 21\u201323]. Other literature indicated that the frequency of deaths was less in men [24].",

Other studies revealed animal to human [33, 34] as the primary culprit of MERS-CoV virus transmission. Specifically, the literature showed camels act as a direct source of human MERS-CoV infection [31, 35], while healthcare workers were reported to be at higher risk [7, 16, 19, 24]. The results of our study in this regard were mixed. While our study indicated that the effect of camel cases on overall MERS-CoV reported cases are positive and significant, the contribution of healthcare workers was not. Our analysis also showed evidence of geographical contributions to MERS-CoV cases such as Saudi Arabia and greater Middle East compared with South Korea. This can be seen as somewhat consistent with earlier studies that demonstrated a link between mortality associated with MERS-CoV and geography [15]. This finding is also intuitive in that Saudi Arabia and Middle East, in general, remain the global epicentre of MERS-CoV, hence the name.",

Unlike previous studies that descriptively analysed seasonality patterns of MERS-CoV and influenza in the Middle East [2], our study presents statistically significant results of trends of global MERS-CoV cases, consistent with regularities underlying the empirical dynamics and classical time series analysis. However, there are limitations of this study. First, the data used for this study comprised 37 months (January 2015 to January 2018). While this was just enough for several years\u2019 worth of monthly observations to appropriately model seasonality, time series analysis can be sensitive to the number of observations. Hence, sufficiently large number of observations might have provided a better fit and results. Additionally, the analysis utilised WHO open source globally reported data, which may lack harmonisation from the various country sources.",

In particular, our analysis of trends and seasonality components the series, the prediction based on the globally reported cases of MERS-CoV and extrapolation into the future by forecasting the trend is envisaged to help in understanding the dynamics of the reported cases over time. The study findings suggest a significant negative trend of the monthly and quarterly data from 2015 to 2018. However, a further extrapolation into the future reveals that the MERS-CoV cases are forecast to be zero by end 2018 or beginning of 2019 unless something unexpected happens. Seasonality component of the series oscillated below or above the baseline, i.e. the centred moving average but did not affect the series over time. The results demonstrated that camel contact, exposure, gender, age and geography/region significantly contributed to the overall global reported MERS-CoV cases. The findings may well inform healthcare practitioners and policymakers about the underlying dynamics that produced the globally reported MERS-CoV cases.",
