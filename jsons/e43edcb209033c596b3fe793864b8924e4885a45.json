            "text": "At present, the United States' (US) healthcare system is facing the challenge of a global pandemic which is impacting intensive and critical care capacity around the world and in major municipal areas in the US. The delivery of emergency, critical and intensive care services requires time-sensitive and life-dependent coordination and teamwork among all members of the care team. 1 Successful teamwork has long been described as a key component of delivering quality health care, 2 and has been cited as a significant factor in limiting loss of life in the aftermath of mass casualty events and major outbreaks, including the present COVID 19 pandemic, but also the ongoing challenges of the opioid epidemic. [3] [4] [5] Coordinated critical care in teams, such as the ICU Liberation Project, have significantly reduced mortality and long term cognitive impairment while reducing the costs of care. 6 Teams can be complex in these care settings, and measuring the configuration and work of teams may require a deeper explication of roles and scope of practice to determine efficient and effective staffing and work design. 7, 8 Coordination may be particularly challenging in hospital settings as professionals and staff have become increasingly specialized and roles have expanded. In theory and practice, teams are not simply groups of people who work together, but who interact to reach a common goal, and have roles or functions to perform. Salas and colleagues, in defining ways of measuring individual versus team performance, point to communication, information exchange, leadership and mission or outcome effectiveness as key measures, along with individual cognition, skills and accuracy. 9, 10 In 2015, the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) released an update on that report calling for more interprofessional education and practice, and better data on team composition, roles and outcomes. 11, 12 A study our team published in 2013 about the roles of NPs and MDs in primary care practices revealed reported similarities with MDs in tasks performed, but revealed deep attitudinal divisions in perceptions of quality, capability, team leadership and payment for services. 13, 14 If these or different conflicts occur in teams in more critical and rapidly evolving situations, quality certainly might suffer.",

We report on NP and MD perceptions in these care settings on their roles and activities, their perceived individual clinical activities, the perceived effectiveness of their teams and their scope of practice. We ask how perceived role clarity and communication predict both team excellence and preparedness to work effectively in a crisis. We hypothesized that MDs and NPs who perceive their roles to be clear would be more likely to perceive excellence in their teamwork, and to report preparedness to function well in a crisis. These data were collected in a period of time when there were several natural and manmade health crises and emergencies in the US and may provide an interesting lens on our present challenges in coping with the COVID-19 epidemic. We selected direct patient care MDs in eligible specialties (Emergency Medicine, Trauma Surgery or Medicine, Critical Care Anesthesia, Pulmonary Critical Care), stratifying the sample to obtain approximately equal representation of Emergency/Trauma and ICU/CCU providers. We selected NPs in eligible specialties consistent with physician specialties where possible (Emergency, Critical Care, Acute Care). The NP sample file did not contain a variable indicating whether the NP practiced in direct patient care and also was limited in that practice and professional characteristics such as site of practice, years in practice were not available.",

We examined the univariate and bivariate relationships, comparing NPs and MDs in the aggregate and by specialty setting (ICU/CCU, emergency/trauma) using two sample t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables on measures that were posed to both groups. We also examined differences within each specialty group, and compared groups by age, medicine and nursing teaching hospital, hospital size and state scope of practice.

Recently available data from one of the author's institutions reveals similar outcomes in nurse-led medical intensive care units and resident units. 18, 19 As clinical leaders consider the implementation of evidence-based practices, these perceived differences may impact the response of frontline clinicians to changes in these environments. It may be useful to encourage NPs and MDs to discuss their perceptions of the quality of care provided by each other and determine if such perceptions interfere with effective teamwork or pose barriers to innovation and change in units.",

Our sample was too small to control for all clinician characteristics; some regression analyses are limited by this factor. Of note, however, differences between NPs and MDs are highly significant on many outcomes, even with samples of this size. Measuring \"team\" proved complex as team composition is not always static in hospital units. The word \"team\" has become widely used in health care-in our changing system with sometimes overlapping and evolving roles and differences in reported role clarity across professions further research is needed to understand optimal team configurations. Despite our extensive efforts to develop and test our questionnaire, all surveys are subject to item and response bias. Finally, these are self-reported data on clinical activities in hospital settings. Due to varying billing and payment practices for hospital care, it is difficult to validate the accuracy of reports on the clinical activities in administrative data for national samples.",

The sickest patients in our institutions require increasingly complex and coordinated care.
