The primary goal of the treatment has been to raise circulating and tissue levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin thereby counteracting unopposed serine protease activity, notably neutrophil elastase, a putative factor in the pathogenesis of COPD. In the United States, regulatory approval by the Food and Drug Administration was obtained only for intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin and only for lung disease associated with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin defi ciency allele combinations; thus, the therapy has been restricted to a single condition.",

It has been shown that alpha-1 antitrypsin that has been modifi ed to lose its antiprotease activity retains potent antiinfl ammatory and immunomodulatory effects on human monocytes and in a mouse model of lung infl ammation [ 1 , 2 ] . Additional data have supported this concept by showing that alpha-1 antitrypsin is an endogenous inhibitor of cytokine production in whole human blood [ 3 ] , that alpha-1 antitrypsin can activate phosphatases to abrogate infl ammatory responses in the lung [ 4 ] , and that alpha-1 antitrypsin inhibits IL-8 and neutrophil chemotaxis in the lung [ 5 -7 ] . Of equal importance have been observations on alpha-1 antitrypsin's anti-apoptotic activity, likely owing to the inhibition of caspases, notably caspase-3 [ 8 -11 ] . Antiangiogenic and antimicrobial effects have also been reported [ 12 -14 ] .",

Why should supranormal circulating and presumably tissue alpha-1 antitrypsin concentrations be benefi cial? In the absence of pharmacokinetic investigations in alpha-1 antitrypsinreplete humans receiving alpha-1 antitrypsin by intravenous infusion or inhalation, the question cannot be answered with confi dence. However, in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin defi ciency, intravenously administered alpha-1 antitrypsin at a dose of 60 mg kg \u22121 has been shown to increase serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels by ~120 mg dl \u22121 from ~60 mg dl \u22121 to a peak of ~180 mg dl \u22121 , with a gradual return to baseline within 7 days [ 20 ] . It is not known if similar increases would be seen in people with normal baseline serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, but assuming an increase in the same range would raise the levels from ~180 mg dl \u22121 to a peak of 300 mg dl \u22121 , with levels remaining above normal for a week. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a positive acute phase reactant, and the above levels are well within the range of serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels seen in conditions of stress such as acute coronary syndrome, abdominal surgery, and open-heart surgery [ 21 -23 ] (Fig. 8.1 ).",

Inasmuch as the presumed role of alpha-1 antitrypsin in the acute phase response is to modulate the biological effects of acute infl ammation, one could argue that maintaining serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels elevated over longer periods of time by the administration of alpha-1 antitrypsin Currently, only human plasma-derived alpha-1 antitrypsin is available for clinical use. The supply of this product is limited but apparently suffi cient to meet the need in patients with an orphan condition such as severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, the only approved indication for alpha-1 antitrypsin therapy at the present time. Future research could identify new therapeutic target conditions for this protein; some of them may not be rare. Therefore, alternate sources and formulations of alpha-1 antitrypsin may have to be developed to meet the greater demand. Inhaled human plasma-derived alpha-1 antitrypsin has been experimentally administered as an aerosol to patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin-replete lung disease [ 25 -27 ] . This mode of administration would reduce the amount of protein needed to treat the lung disease of alpha-1 antitrypsin-defi cient and alpha-1 antitrypsin-replete patients. However, alternate sources of alpha-1 antitrypsin have been explored in an attempt to replace the human plasma-derived product. Several companies have used transgenic and recombinant approaches. A major challenge has been the requirement of mimicking the glycosylation pattern of native human alpha-1 antitrypsin to ensure adequate tissue penetration and acceptable plasma half-life values. Further studies are warranted to demonstrate the safety and effi cacy of such products.",

            "text": "As an autoimmune condition, type 1 diabetes mellitus involves infl ammationrelated injury to beta cells in the pancreas, leading to fl uctuating blood glucose levels. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is an endogenous anti-infl ammatory molecule that could correct altered immunoregulatory pathways and modulate the infl ammation associated with type 1 diabetes thereby improving blood glucose control [ 29 ] . This concept is strengthened by the fact that alpha-1 antitrypsin is locally manufactured in the pancreas under normal circumstances in various species including man. For example, the porcine pancreas contains alpha-1 antitrypsin as assessed by proteomic analysis, especially during development [ 30 ] . In humans, alpha-1 antitrypsin expression and secretion by islet cells has been investigated by immunofl uorescence, Western blotting, and ELISA [ 31 ] . It was shown that alpha and delta cells are the primary source of synthesis and presumably secretion. Given the proximity of these cells to beta cells, this suggests the presence of a locally mediated biological function of alpha-1 antitrypsin by modulating immunologic and infl ammatory processes that could be involved in type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, it has been reported that circulating alpha-1 antitrypsin is less active in diabetic individuals, possibly due to high glucose levels in hepatocytes where alpha-1 antitrypsin therefore is excessively glycated [ 32 , 33 ] . Alpha-1 antitrypsin glycation also could occur in other alpha-1 antitrypsin-generating tissues, including the islet of the pancreas. So far, this has not been investigated.",

The primary outcomes have been blood glucose levels and survival and function of beta cells transplanted into diabetic mice (antirejection action of alpha-1 antitrypsin). In a 4-week-old nonobese diabetic mouse strain, gene therapy with human alpha-1 antitrypsin using an adenoassociated viral vector prevented the development of diabetes [ 34 , 35 ] . This was associated with an altered T-cell repertoire in spleen cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the alpha-1 antitrypsin effect in the pancreas. A complementary study showed that in nonobese diabetic mice with early type 1 diabetes, alpha-1 antitrypsin therapy restored euglycemia and promoted beta cell expansion; again the effect was attributed to alpha-1 antitrypsin's broad anti-infl ammatory actions [ 36 ] . In another murine model of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes, an Fc-fused recombinant alpha-1 antitrypsin protein lacking anti-elastase activity prevented hyperglycemia [ 32 ] . At least in this model, the anti-infl ammatory action of alpha-1 antitrypsin could not be attributed to its anti-elastase activity, pointing to other immunomodulatory and anti-infl ammatory actions. In particular, alpha-1 antitrypsin's known caspase-3 inhibitory and anti-apoptotic actions may have a role as shown in vitro and in vivo [ 37 ] . In that investigation, alpha-1 antitrypsin inhibited caspase-3 activity and prevented tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis in a murine insulinoma cell line and reduced beta cell apoptosis as assessed by a TUNEL assay in streptozotocin-treated diabetic mice.",

In 12 patients with type 1 diabetes and detectable blood C-peptide levels, the effect of 80 mg/kg alpha-1 antitrypsin, administered by intravenous infusion weekly for 8 weeks, on the C-peptide response to a mixed meal challenge was investigated. The C-peptide response (expressed as area under the curve) increased at 3 months in only fi ve patients ( Fig. 8.2 ), but there was an inverse relationship between the frequency of IL-1 betaproducing monocytes and the C-peptide response, indicating that specifi c infl ammatory pathways sensitize patients to the effects of alpha-1 antitrypsin on beta cell function.

First, neutrophil elastase has been clearly shown to have a critical role in the pathogenesis of CF and common COPD [ 56 , 57 ] . Alpha-1 antitrypsin is the most potent inhibitor of neutrophil elastase and, by suppressing neutrophil elastase activity, would be expected to ameliorate the disease process and prevent or slow progressive lung remodeling and functional impairment.

            "text": "The lung disease of CF involves neutrophil elastase and its effects on mucus secretion, proteolytic destruction of airway and lung tissue, and facilitation of bacterial infection, notably by Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 58 , 59 ] . Neutrophils are recruited to lung tissue primarily by interleukin 8 (IL-8). Neutrophil elastase is released from neutrophils during migration, upon immune complex stimulation, and when they undergo necrosis or apoptosis [ 60 ] . In addition, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha promote neutrophil elastase release from neutrophils [ 63 ] . Alpha-1 antitrypsin is the most potent known inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, has other antiprotease activity relevant to CF, and is anti-apoptotic [ 8 , 59 ] . However, its concentration in airway and lung tissue, even if above normal due to a presumably increased secretion by the liver, may not be suffi cient to counteract the markedly augmented neutrophil elastase activity in the CF lung [ 56 ] . Given the importance of proteolytic activity in the infl ammatory process associated with CF-related lung disease, it is not surprising that alpha-1 antitrypsin has been thought of as a therapeutic for this disease. Over 20 years ago, McElvaney et al. [ 58 ] administered aerosolized human plasma-derived alpha-1 antitrypsin to 12 patients with CF for 1 week. The authors showed that the treatment reduced neutrophil elastase activity in epithelial surface liquid (bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid) with a critical alpha-1 antitrypsin concentration of 8 \u03bcM; treatment also stimulated Pseudomonas aeruginosa killing by bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid in vitro. Since then, major advances have been made in aerosol delivery technology with devices that can now deliver up to 70 % of the fi lling dose to the lungs [ 26 , 27 , 62 ] . In addition, high-purity liquid alpha-1 antitrypsin formulations are now available, and so far short-term aerosol alpha-1 antitrypsin treatment for up to 28 days has been found to be safe [ 26 , 27 , 50 , 62 ] .",

Yet, several in vitro observations and in vivo investigations in animals have shown that alpha-1 antitrypsin administration can attenuate experimental emphysema. Pemberton et al. [ 65 ] reported that a 6-month treatment with inhaled recombinant alpha-1 antitrypsin reduced airspace enlargement by 70 % in cigarette smokeinduced emphysema in mice. Additional experiments have shown that alpha-1 antitrypsin's anti-apoptotic activity could have a major role in this protective effect. Thus, in a murine emphysema model in which airspace enlargement was induced by pharmacologic inhibition of vascular growth factor receptors, mice overexpressing human MM alpha-1 antitrypsin were protected from the airspace enlargement; the protection was attributed to caspase-3 inhibition by alpha-1 antitrypsin [ 66 ] . A possible link between this observation and human cigarette smoke-induced COPD can be gleaned from an in vitro experiment in which alpha-1 antitrypsin purifi ed from blood exhibited different anti-caspase activity in smokers and nonsmokers [ 7 ] . Alpha-1 antitrypsin derived from smokers inhibited executioner caspases (caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7) signifi cantly less than alpha-1 antitrypsin from nonsmokers.",

In CF, phase 2 clinical trials have already been carried out and the prospect of phase 3 trials with inhaled alpha-1 antitrypsin in the future. In contrast, even early human studies with inhaled alpha-1 antitrypsin currently are lacking although the rationale for such treatment seems to be equally strong for both conditions. Awaiting the results of inhaled therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin defi ciency-associated COPD before investigating the effects of inhaled alpha-1 antitrypsin in alpha-1 antitrypsin-replete COPD may not be an optimal approach as raising alpha-1 antitrypsin levels toward or to normal may not be suffi cient to modify the spectrum of infl ammatory processes involved in common COPD.
