PRRSV is therefore suspected to have an immunosuppressive effect on pigs.",

Such synergism has been supported by clinical, virological and immunological observations. The immunosuppressive effect of PRRSV on the host response to pseudorabies virus (PRV) has also been investigated in the respiratory system (Shibata et al., 2003), but there have been few histopathological studies supporting synergism in dual infections with PRRSV and PRV, or in dual infection with PRRSV and other respiratory viral agents (De Bruin et al., 2000).",

In this study, pigs infected with PRRSV or PRV alone did not show severe clinical signs, but there was a febrile response in pigs infected with PRV, and there were slight respiratory symptoms in pigs infected with PRRSV. The four dually infected pigs (group 1), however, showed severe neurological signs characterized by ataxia and muscular tremors. These findings, which resembled those reported by Shibata et al. (2003), suggested that PRRSV infection in pigs affects the replication of PRV.",

In the present experiment, seven pigs infected with PRRSV (groups 1 and 2) had slight interstitial pneumonia but no necrotizing bronchiolitis. These pneumonic lesions were closely associated with the presence of PRRSV antigen, and were probably due to PRRSV infection since they resembled PRRSV-associated lesions described in previous reports (Rossow, 1998, Shibata et al., 2003). Five of six pigs infected with PRV (groups 1 and 3) had non-suppurative encephalitis and trigeminal ganglioneuritis. One dually infected pig (no. 1) had severe necrotizing encephalitis with intranuclear inclusion bodies, while the other three (nos 2\u20134) had prominent encephalomalacia, with macrophages. All dually infected pigs had tonsillitis with inclusion bodies and severe atrophy of the thymus. These results strongly suggest that PRRSV infection in pigs can increase the severity of brain and tonsillar lesions due to PRV replication, and also the severity of lung lesions (Shibata et al., 2003). Moreover, thymic atrophy may be related to dual infection.",

The total cell number in the BALF increased by up to 4-fold in all PRRSV-infected pigs, and PRRSV (but not PRV) antigen was detected in the alveolar macrophages.

In PRV infection in pigs, infection spreads from the nasal cavity via the olfactory pathway to produce non-suppurative encephalitis (Narita et al., 1985, Narita et al., 1991, Narita et al., 1993, Narita et al., 1997, Narita et al., 1992). In the present experiments, one dually infected pig had severe encephalitis and three had encephalomalacia, characterized by neuronal degeneration with intranuclear inclusion bodies, a diffuse or focal glial reaction, and perivascular cuffing, as well as by cavitation accompanied by large numbers of macrophages. The lesions were mainly confined to the olfactory bulb and rhinencephalon, including the olfactory tract, olfactory stria, and pyriform cortex. The encephalomalacic lesions may therefore have developed from necrotic foci similar to those observed in PRV-infected newborn piglets (Nunoya et al., 1985) and in animals with fluctuating temperatures (Narita et al., 1991). Thus, the neuropathological findings strongly suggested that PRRSV infection in pigs enhanced the severity of brain lesions caused by PRV. This apparent synergy was supported by histopathological findings.",
