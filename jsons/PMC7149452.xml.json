Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV isolates from animals indicated that this virus most probably originated from bats, was transmitted first to palm civets and subsequently to humans at the wet markets in southern China. Subsequent outbreaks occurred early 2003 in Hong Kong, Hanoi, Toronto, and Singapore, and could be directly traced back to one index patient who acquired the infection in Guangdong and traveled to Hong Kong. A worldwide epidemic was halted through the efforts of the World Health Organization, which responded rapidly to this threat by issuing a global alert, rigorous local containment efforts, warning against unnecessary travel to affected areas, and by creating a network of international experts to combat this virus. In the end only 8096 people became ill, and 774 people died in this first SARS epidemic. Because SARS-CoV could re-emerge and cause another epidemic at any time, development of effective vaccines remains of vital importance.",

The genome is packaged together with the nucleocapsid protein, at least five membrane proteins (M, E, 3a, 7a, and 7b) and the spike (S) protein (Fig. 36.1\n). The S1 region within the S protein, and more specifically a 193-amino acid fragment of the S protein (corresponding to residues 318\u2013510), has been identified as the region that interacts with the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Li et al., 2005a). The majority of neutralizing antibodies are directed against this region of the S protein. Antibodies raised against the N-terminal region of 3a protein or the M protein also inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro but their relevance in protection remains unclear. The genome also encodes two large poly-proteins with diverse enzymatic activities needed for efficient replication and several accessory proteins with unknown function (3b, 6, 8a, 8b, and 9b).",

Pathogenic SARS-CoVs do not circulate in the human population at the moment, but their re-emergence from \u00adanimal reservoirs may likely occur in the future. Because many of the early SARS patients in Guandong had epidemiological links to the live-animal market trade, different animal species were tested for the presence of SARS-like viruses. Soon after the outbreak, a SARS-like coronavirus, which had more than 99% homology with human SARS-CoV, was detected by RT-PCR in the nasal and fecal swabs of palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog (Nyctereutes \u00adprocyonoides) (Guan et al., 2003). More recent studies indicate that bats may potentially act as natural reservoirs for SARS-like CoVs (Li et al., 2005b; Lau et al., 2005). However, sequence comparison of the S protein genes from bat SARS-like CoV and palm civet SARS-like CoV revealed only 64% genetic homology. Subsequent studies by Tang et al. (2006) have demonstrated that approximately 6% of bats sampled in China were positive for CoVs. Interestingly, these CoVs are genetically diverse and many bat CoVs clustered with existing group 1 viruses, while others formed a separate lineage that included only viruses from bats (putative group 5). Other SARS-CoV like viruses clustered in a putative group 4 consisting of two subgroups, one of bat CoVs and another of SARS-CoVs from humans and other mammalian hosts. However, from these studies the direct progenitor of the SARS-CoV isolated from palm civets has not been identified. Major genetic variations in the S protein gene of these viruses from civet cats, seemed essential for the \u00adtransition from animal-to-human transmission to human-to-human transmission, which eventually caused the SARS outbreak of 2002\u20132003.",

In fact, none of the SARS-CoV-infected children aged below 12 years in Hong Kong required intensive care or mechanical ventilation (Ng et al., 2004). This is not totally explained by comorbid factors but similar age dependence in mortality is seen in patients with other (nonviral) causes of acute respiratory stress syndrome (Rubenfeld et al., 2005). Second, virus transmission is low in the first days of illness and peaks around day 10 after disease onset (Chu et al., 2004). Finally, several studies revealed that high viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirate was found to be an independent predictor of mortality (Hung et al., 2004; Chu et al., 2004). Therefore, vaccine strategies aimed at reducing the viral load may suffice to provide clinical benefit.",

Ribavirin, which targets IMP dehydrogenase, has been known a long time as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. However, current data do not support the use of ribavirin for SARS treatment; in vitro studies did not show significant antiviral activity (Cinatl et al., 2003) and ribavirin enhanced the infectivity of SARS-CoV in mice (Barnard et al., 2006). On the other hand, a protective effect of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 has been observed in a preliminary study during the SARS outbreak (Loutfy et al., 2003). These results are in concordance with several studies that noted antiviral activity in vitro (Cinatl et al., 2003; Hensley et al., 2004) and animal studies showing that pegylated IFN-\u03b1 effectively reduced SARS-CoV replication and excretion, viral antigen expression by type 1 pneumocytes and the pulmonary damage in cynomolgous macaques that were infected experimentally with SARS-CoV (Haagmans et al., 2004). However, despite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it is not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak. Because of variation in treatment regimens\u2014particularly the wide range in doses, duration of therapy, and route of administration of ribavirin and corticosteroids, no clear conclusion can be drawn regarding the efficacy of the drugs tested (Stockman et al., 2006). In the event of a future outbreak of SARS-CoV or another novel agent, attempts should be made to develop treatment protocols, organize randomized trials and to collect and contribute information for a standardized minimum dataset that could facilitate analysis of treatment outcomes among different settings (Stockman et al., 2006).\n",

            "text": "The major sources of transmission in humans are droplets that deposit on the respiratory epithelium. Unlike the situation in several other respiratory viral infections, viral load of SARS-CoV in the upper respiratory tract peaked around day 10 after disease onset (Peiris et al., 2004). Therefore, virus transmission may be less efficient in the first days of illness, a finding supported by epidemiological observations. Real-time PCR assays detect SARS-CoV during the first week in specimens of the lower respiratory tract (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, endotracheal aspirates), nasopharyngeal aspirate, throat swabs, and/or serum (Chan et al., 2004, Che et al., 2004), whereas fecal samples may show very high viral loads toward the end of the first week and second week of illness. In typical cases, which were largely confined to adult and elderly individuals, SARS presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage and multiorgan dysfunction upon autopsy (Nicholls et al., 2003). The pathological changes in lung alveoli most likely follow a common pathway characterized by an acute phase of protein-rich alveolar fluid influx into the alveolar lumina as a consequence of the injury to the alveolar wall. Subsequently type-2 pneumocyte hyperplasia takes place to replace the loss of infected type-1 pneumocytes and to cover the denuded epithelial basement membrane, resulting in restoration of the normal alveolar architecture. Severe alveolar injury may lead to fibrosis with loss of alveolar function in more protracted cases (Fig. 36.3\n).",

These in vivo data have been confirmed in vitro, demonstrating that SARS-CoV infection induces a range of cytokines and chemokines in diverse cell types (Cheung et al., 2005; Law et al., 2005). Although in vitro studies argued that production of type I IFNs is inhibited or delayed by SARS-CoV, in SARS-CoV-infected macaques, and also early during SARS in humans, type I IFNs can be readily demonstrated (De Lang et al., 2007). Because prophylactic treatment of macaques with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 reduces SARS-CoV replication in the lungs, regulation of the production of IFNs may be important in controlling SARS (Haagmans et al., 2004).\n",

Moreover, the vaccine conferred protective immunity as demonstrated by prevention of SARS-CoV \u00adreplication in the respiratory tract of mice after intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV. Protection of mice was \u00adcorrelated to the antibody titer against the SARS-CoV S protein and neutralizing antibody titer. Similar results have been obtained using a beta-propiolactone inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in mice (Stadler et al., 2005). In addition, two Chinese groups have demonstrated protective efficacy of inactivated SARS vaccines in rhesus monkeys (Qin et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2005, Zou et al., 2004). A soluble recombinant polypeptide containing the N-terminal segment of the S glycoprotein may suffice to induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity in mice (Bisht et al., 2005).

However, SARS-CoV deletion mutants lacking ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, or 7b, grew similar to that of the parental wild-type virus in the mouse model (Yount et al., 2005). On the other hand, a recombinant SARS-CoV that lacks the E gene was attenuated both in vitro and in vivo (DeDiego et al., 2007). Viable recombinant virus with the E gene deleted was recovered in Vero cells with a titer around 106\n pfu/ml but titers in the respiratory tract of hamsters were 100\u20131000-fold reduced compared to wild-type SARS-CoV replication, suggesting that this mutant is attenuated.

In order to prevent this, it has been proposed to delete an essential gene, located in a position distant from gene E, and the relocation of the deleted gene to the position previously occupied by gene E (Enjuanes et al., 2008). A potential recombination leading to the rescue of gene E would lead to the loss of the essential gene. Alternatively, the transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) of a vaccine virus could be genetically manipulated to a sequence incompatible with the TRS of any known circulating coronavirus as described by Yount et al. (2006). This virus could be further modified by building attenuating mutations on the genetic backbone of the recombination resistant TRS rewired virus either for use as a safe high titer seed stock for making killed vaccines or as a live virus vaccine. One such attenuating mutation could be targeted to the nonstructural protein 1. Recombinant Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) encoding a deletion in the nsp1-coding sequence grew normally in tissue culture but was severely attenuated in vivo (Z\u00fcst et al., 2007). Low doses of nsp1 mutant MHV elicited potent cytotoxic T cell responses and protected mice against homologous and heterologous virus challenge. This attenuation strategy provides a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient coronavirus vaccines.",

Vaccination with MVA encoding the S protein induced only moderate antibody responses and consequently did not protect against intranasal SARS-CoV infection and even resulted in an inflammatory response in the livers of the vaccinated ferrets (Weingartl et al., 2004). Whether these aberrant responses resulted from immunopathological mechanisms, like antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, or represented recall responses to viral antigen in the liver is not clear at the moment but deserves further investigation. In addition, limited protection from SARS-CoV challenge was observed in ferrets vaccinated with inactivated whole virus (Darnell et al., 2007). Two out of four ferrets showed little or no neutralizing antibody even after the second immunization and none of the vaccinated ferrets were able to reduce virus excretion at day 2 after challenge but subsequently cleared the virus more rapidly compared to control animals. Adenovirus-based vaccines tested in ferrets seemed more powerful as they protected the lower respiratory tract efficiently but had less effect on virus excretion in the upper respiratory tract (Kobinger et al., 2007).",

Although attempts have been made to test the efficacy of serum preparations from seroconvalescent SARS patients in the acute phase of SARS, no conclusive evidence has been obtained regarding their efficacy. In mice, on the other hand, SARS-CoV infection is efficiently controlled upon passive transfer of convalescent immunoglobulines (Subbarao et al., 2004). The concept that antibodies protect against SARS has been further explored through the generation of human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV. Prophylactic administration of a human monoclonal antibody reduced replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of infected ferrets by 1000-fold, completely prevented the development of SARS-CoV-induced macroscopic lung pathology, and abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions (Ter Meulen et al., 2004). In subsequent studies, several other monoclonal antibodies were evaluated for their efficacy in mouse and hamster models (Sui et al., 2005; Traggiai et al., 2004).",
