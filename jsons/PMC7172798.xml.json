Thus, proper calf management and rearing are important considerations in livestock production. Newborn calves are agammaglobulinemic and susceptible to infection. To prevent health problems, calves acquire immunity from colostrum which is a natural source of immune factors and nutrients (Godden, 2008; Raboisson et al., 2016; Torsein et al., 2011). In this paper, colostrum will be defined as a secretion collected from the first milking, while milk from subsequent milkings is referred to as \u201ctransition milk\u201d.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that calves should be fed only high-quality colostrum containing at least 50 g/L of immunoglobulins (IgG) (McGuirk and Collins, 2004). However, IgG concentrations in bovine colostrum can vary. Several factors have been shown to affect IgG concentrations in colostrum, including parity, breed, age, the metabolic status of dam, and the length of the dry period (Gomez and Chamorro, 2017; Morin et al., 2010; Quigley et al., 2013; Weaver et al., 2000). Inadequate colostrum intake and its poor quality can result in the failure of passive transfer (FPT) which is a commonly encountered problem whose causes and consequences have been well documented (Beam et al., 2009; Chigerwe et al., 2008; Furman-Fr\u0105tczak et al., 2011). FPT is diagnosed when IgG serum concentrations drop below 10 g/L during the first 24 h after birth. Serum IgG levels higher than 10 g/L point to successful passive transfer of immunity. In calves, morbidity and mortality are minimized when IgG serum levels exceed 16 g/L (Godden, 2008; G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2004). Immunoglobulins are absorbed most effectively during the first 24 h postpartum; therefore, calves should receive 2 to 4 L of colostrum during the first feeding within the first 6 h postpartum. Importantly, the volume offered to the calf should depend on the quality of colostrum. Ideally, the portion should provide at least 200 g of IgG, which is regarded as sufficient for reaching IgG serum concentration higher than 10 g/L (Raboisson et al., 2016; Vasseur et al., 2010). Additionally, colostrum contains more vital ingredients such as maternal leukocytes, growth factors, hormones, cytokines and nonspecific antimicrobial factors (Ontsouka et al., 2016). These immunological and biochemical components also protect agammaglobulinemic calves and support the establishment and development of the gut microbiome (Barrington and Parrish, 2001; Godden, 2008; Gomez and Chamorro, 2017). Despite the benefits of colostrum, artificial feeding (for example, with the use of an oroesophageal tube) is the method of choice in calves that experience problems with colostrum drinking to prevent FPT (Godden, 2008). Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that the supplementation of transition milk with colostrum could improve the immune status and blood biochemical parameters of calves and, consequently, their growth performance.",

During the dry period, all cows were vaccinated against colibacillosis and rota- and coronaviruses. Cows in maternity pens were monitored until calving. After birth, female calves born within two months (mean birth weight 43.4 \u00b1 5.5 kg) to primiparous and multiparous dams [(the average parity of the dams was 2.47 \u00b1 0.47, Mean \u00b1 SEM for control group (CR) and 2.39 \u00b1 0.36, Mean \u00b1 SEM for treatment group, (TRT)] were assigned to a CR (n = 17) or a TRT (n = 18). After parturition calves were separated from dams and kept in individual pens until transfer (at the age of 3 months) to another building within the farm where they were placed in group pens. Additionally, after parturition, colostrum was harvested from each dam within 1 h post partum. In the TRT group, all colostrum collected on the first day (two milkings) was pooled in 1 kg bottles separately for each calf, and kept in the freezer (\u221220\u00b0C). Calves were fed only from colostrum and/or transition milk milked from their dams. Before feeding to calves, colostrum was thawed in a warm water bath (not exceeding 40\u00b0C). Colostrum temperature was checked before feeding. The target temperature of colostrum was approximately 39\u00b0C.",

According to the current industrial recommendations, colostrum should contain at least 50 g/L of immunoglobulins to prevent FPT (Morrill et al., 2012; Vasseur et al., 2009). In the present study, average IgG concentration in colostrum determined for the entire herd was 77.2 g/L, which points to its high quality. The calculated average concentration of IgG was higher than that noted by Furman-Fr\u0105tczak et al. (2011) (65.5 g/L) but lower than that reported by Kinal et al. (2004) (79.5 g/L). According to several authors (Faber et al., 2005; Swan et al., 2007; Weaver et al., 2000), FPT is diagnosed if serum IgG falls below 10 g/L within 24\u201332 h after birth. In our experiment, only one CR calf failed to reach the recommended threshold within 24 h after birth. Moreover, despite lower colostrum quality, colostrum-supplemented transition milk increased serum IgG concentrations in calves receiving the treatment. In this study, colostrum-supplemented transition milk seem to offer more effective immunological protection due to increased serum IgG concentrations on d 60. In the CR group, 60% of calves were treated for diarrhea. Additionally, the incidence of respiratory disorders in this group reached 18%. Our results correspond with those reported by \u017bychli\u0144ska-Buczek et al. (2015), but are higher than those noted by Svensson et al. (2006) and Gulliksen et al. (2009). In contrast, the incidence of diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infections in TRT calves was 40% and 33%, respectively, supporting a positive effect of colostrum-supplemented transition milk on the health status of calves. Although IgG are absorbed most effectively within the first 20 h postpartum, the efficiency of this process drops rapidly 12 h after delivery (Ontsouka et al., 2016; Suh et al., 2003), it seems that the applied treatment enhanced acquiring immunity in supplemented calves.",

Lys is an antimicrobial enzyme that is found in cells and tissues and is involved in non-specific innate immunity; therefore, increased lys activity in early stages of life might be considered beneficial (Firth et al., 2005; Gueorguiev et al., 1996). Calves from the CR group were characterized by lower values of growth parameters than calves from the TRT group. The absence of clinical disease symptoms and improved growth in the TRT group point to reduced absorption of lys from colostrum, but are not indicative of subclinical infections (Piantedosi et al., 2010). Previous research (Li et al., 1995) indicates that glycation, a posttranslational protein modification which requires the presence of proteins and sugars in the same matrix, significantly decreases lys activity. However, the above conclusions should be formulated with caution due to limited data on changes in lys activity in newborn calves.",

Thus, our observations of changes in cp activity, accompanied by higher IgG concentrations and lower lys activity, indicate that alterations in cp levels are associated with Cu release from the liver (Abeni et al., 2012). The above phenomenon as well as the lower incidence of clinical symptoms of infection and a fast growth rate of calves can be attributed to the healthy development of the gastrointestinal tract (Zwierzchowski et al., 2016).",

The effect of aging on changes in biochemical parameters has been widely discussed (Knowles et al., 2000; Mohri et al., 2007; Pavlik et al., 2010; Zwierzchowski et al., 2016). However, the aim of this study was to determine alterations in selected parameters associated with gastrointestinal function as a natural consequence of experimental diet manipulation. ALT, AST, and AP are non-specific enzymatic disease markers associated with liver function, growth and development of skeletal muscles and bone mineralization (Mohri et al., 2007). In our study, colostrum-supplemented transition milk had no effect on ALT and AST activity (Table 2), which can be considered desirable. Any changes in the activity of those enzymes should be treated with caution and approached as a potential marker of liver dysfunction. It should be noted that increased AST activity in ruminants was associated with liver damage caused by high-grain diets (Castillo et al., 2012). According to Egli and Blum (1998), increased AP and LDH activity in the first stage of life is related to colostrum ingestion. Our findings confirm this hypothesis. The average activity of AP and LDH was higher in TRT calves that gained weight at a faster rate. Rapid weight gain requires better bone mineralization which stimulates AP release. LDH is also considered as a non-specific marker of disease since there are many factors contributing to its activity variations. Additionally, LDH activity differ between tissues, cells, fluids and those differences can be enhanced depending on the disease the animal is suffering from (Mohri et al., 2007; Nagy et al., 2013). For instance, some authors (\u017barczy\u0144ska et al., 2012) link increased LDH activity with muscular dystrophy, but it was not the case in our study since we did not observe any symptoms of this disease. On the contrary, there are reports suggesting LDH fluctuations during respiratory diseases (Nagy et al., 2013). However, we did not analyze each isoform separately, therefore any conclusion coming from our study should be drawn with caution.",

            "text": "Calves from the TRT group were characterized by higher values of Glu, chol, TAG, and TP. According to Reynolds et al. (2003), in the first stage of life, glu levels are associated with colostrum intake, whereas in later stages, an increase in glu concentrations is linked with up-regulated corticosteroid secretion due to intensified growth. The latter increases chol and TAG levels (Cavestany et al., 2005). The concentrations of glu, chol, and TAG can be altered by infection or diet (Bozukluhan et al., 2017). This observation is consistent with our results because the incidence of diarrhea was higher in the CR group than in the TRT group (10 vs. 6 diarrhea cases, respectively). Calloway et al. (2002) suggested that TP is a potential FPT diagnostic tool. In the proposed approach, serum TP levels should not decrease below 52 g/L 72 h postpartum. In our study, the average TP concentration in CR calves at 3 d of age was 51.3 g/L, which indicates that the suggested safety threshold was not reached. Indeed TP was correlated with IgG concentration (P < 0.001), however correlation coefficient indicated moderate link between both parameters (r = 0.437; Figure S1). In 8 out of 17 calves in the CR group TP was below the recommended level of 52 g/L. In contrast, only one TRT calf failed to reach the TP concentration of 52 g/L. These results corroborate previous research findings (Cuttance et al., 2017; Je\u017eek et al., 2006; Knowles et al., 2000; Mohri et al., 2007; Zwierzchowski et al., 2016).",

All cases of diarrhea were recorded until 21 d of age, thus reflecting changes in urea and crea. Interestingly, calves from the TRT group were diagnosed with diarrhea at an earlier stage of life, but the supplementation of transition milk with colostrum delivered health benefits at later stages. In previous studies (Adams et al., 1993; Thrall et al., 2012), elevated crea levels were noted in calves when skeletal muscles were used as a source of energy.
