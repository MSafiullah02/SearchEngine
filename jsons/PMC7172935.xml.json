            "text": "Respiratory viruses are major contributors to morbidity and mortality in all age groups [1], [2], [3], [4]. Rapid identification is important for both therapeutic and infection control purposes. Traditional rapid viral diagnoses such as immunoassays produce quick results and are simple to perform; however, have sub-optimal sensitivity [5], [6], [7], [8]. Nucleic acid amplification assays (NAAT), which are relatively rapid and have greatly enhanced sensitivity, are becoming the method of choice [9]. More recently, less complex sample-to-result molecular platforms such as Xpert Flu Assay (Cepheid), RP (BioFire Diagnostics), RV+ (Nanosphere), eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Diagnostic) and Liat Influenza A/B (Iquum) have been introduced into the marketplace which have the potential to provide results in 1\u20134 h with random access capabilities [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. The main purpose of this study was to compare the performance of two new automated real-time PCR systems with a proven reliable comparator system [11], [13], [17], [20], [21].",

The most cumbersome step for both was the test preparation, including sample addition. RP has an extra step of sample dilution, but the hands-on-time (HOT) was only 5 min (Table 3\n). RV+ had the additional steps of thawing for frozen reagents, loading the cartridges and trays, and one return to the instrument post-amplification for cartridge reading, for a total HOT of 21 min. Pro is more manual, including nucleic acid extraction and amplification reagent preparation, but has higher throughput capabilities. Cost analysis demonstrates that RP is the most expensive per test, however there are multiple targets reportable and billable per test, hence the cost/reportable is considerably lower than other methods.",

Hence, it is surprising that in our study the LOD for all FluA strains tested were much lower with RV+ than RP; and both systems demonstrated excellent sensitivity with clinical specimens. Furthermore, Van Wesenbeeck et al. [25] evaluated the LOD of the different assays based on the virus titers in the clinical samples and were able to determine an LOD for RP and Pro for FluA in the range of 3.5\u20134.5 log RNA copies/ml, which is similar to our findings for Pro but not for RP. One potential reason for the discrepancy between studies is that all specimens in the Belgium study were collected between February and March 2012 and almost all FluA specimens subtyped as sH3. Hence, RV+ may perform suboptimally with the strain of sH3 circulating in Belgium during the winter of 2012. Our clinical samples would have been representative of the typical genetic diversity seen over a period of 4 years. In addition, these authors reported a higher than typical percentage of invalid results with RV+ (15.8%), which may indicate a system problem or improper handling of reagents which is critical for optimal performance.",

In addition, assay specificity cannot be accurately assessed because the population was artificially skewed toward positive specimens rather than the annual respiratory virus positivity rate of 29% that we typically see at our institution. However, false positive results were seen with both RP and RV+. It is possible that the false positive results were an artifact of testing samples in pools. Contamination is another possible source for false positive results. RP is a closed, real-time PCR; hence there is no opportunity for contamination with residual amplicon. Of course, carry over contamination between samples is possible, but unlikely since the samples were all tested individually on one instrument. Although RV+ does involve post-amplification processing, the manufacturer has indicated that amplicons are not released from their cartridges.",

But since this system does not detect other respiratory viruses, a second system would be required if a full diagnostic profile is needed. RP has room temperature reagent storage and a total test time of little over an hour, making this system conducive for STAT testing. RP also detects a broad range of organisms, including HRV and CoV. After our studies were performed, the manufacturer added two more strains of CoV, as well as three bacterial targets.
