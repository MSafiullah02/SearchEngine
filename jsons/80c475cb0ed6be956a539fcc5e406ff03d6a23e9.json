Morphology and function of the spleen in bats, which are hosts to several viral strains without exhibiting clinical symptoms, remain to be fully elucidated. This study aims to examine the spleen morphology of fruit bats associated with their physiological functions. Spleen histological observations were performed in three fruit bats species: Cynopterus titthaecheilus (n = 9), Rousettus leschenaultii (n = 3) and Pteropus vampyrus (n = 3). The spleens of these fruit bats were surrounded by a thin capsule. Red pulp consisted of splenic cord and wide vascular space filled with blood. Ellipsoids in all three studied species were found numerously and adjacent to one another forming macrophages aggregates. White pulp consisted of periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS), lymphoid follicles and marginal zone. The lymphoid follicle contained a germinal centre and a tingible body macrophage that might reflect an active immune system. The marginal zone was prominent and well developed. This study reports some differences in spleen structure of fruit bats compared to other bat species previously reported and discusses possible physiological implications of the spleen based on its morphology.

Studies have thus far reported 1,240 species of bats in the world, which represent more than 20% of mammalian species (Calisher et al., 2006; Wang, Walker, & Poon, 2011) . The order Chiroptera is divided into two suborders: Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera (Lei & Dong, 2016; Teeling et al., 2005) . Fruit bats, included in the suborder Yinpterochiroptera, are often found near residential areas (Basri et al., 2017) . The decline of tree and fruit populations in forests, forest fires and extreme climate change often lead to the foray of fruit bats into human farming areas, especially during the fruiting season (Basri et al., 2017; P\u00e1ez, Restif, Eby, & Plowright, 2018) . Large-sized fruit bats, such as flying foxes, are nomadic foragers capable of flying up to 100 km from the roosting site in one night (Hengjan et al., 2018) . Fruit bats, being social beings, are reported to engage in conflicts over food with other species such as monkeys . Fruit-eating behaviour is also an important factor aiding in spreading of viruses between species.",

Various components of their immunity have adapted to the existence of the virus, resulting in a symbiotic relationship between them. This suggests that bats have a strong immune organ structure to prepare for viral infection that might damage their system. However, details of the bat immune system remain to be elucidated completely. One important immune organ that performs several functions related to differences in structure between species is the spleen (Brendolan, Rosado, Carsetti, Selleri, & Dear, 2007; Cesta, 2006; Haley, 2003) . This secondary lymphoid organ plays a major role in innate and adaptive immunity to bloodborne pathogens, including viruses (Den Haan & Kraal, 2012; Mebius & Kraal, 2005; Zhao, Liu, Guo, & Zhu, 2015) . The organ also plays a role in extramedullary haematopoiesis, haemostasis, metabolism of red blood cells and blood storing. Role dominance of the spleen varies between species and is dependent on the organ structure and its constituent cell components (Bowdler, 2002; Brendolan et al., 2007; Udroiu, 2006) . The spleen parenchyma is wrapped and infiltrated by capsules and trabeculae composed of collagen fibres and smooth muscles. The thickness of the capsule and the spread of smooth muscles affect contractility, which determines the speed of blood ejection from the spleen. The characteristics of the spleen sinuses also vary between species: some species have sinuses (sinusal type) and some do not have sinuses (non-sinusal type; Bowdler, 2002; Press & Landsverk, 2006; Udroiu, 2006) .",

The fulfilment of oxygen requirements in aerobic mammals activities can be done by increasing the circulating blood volume, which is in resting state, the blood stored in the spleen as reported in racehorses, hunter dogs and diving seals (Dane et al., 2006; Poole & Erickson, 2015; Thornton et al., 2001) .

This study found no megakaryocyte in the red pulp of the three bat species. This indicates that the bat's spleen has little or no role in thrombopoiesis. Megakaryocyte is normally found in the high number in the spleen as reported in cats, dogs, rats, mice, camels and leopard seals (Gray et al., 2006; Rothermel, 1930; Ward et al., 2018; . The absence of megakaryocyte is also observed in the Cape fur seal spleen (Stewardson, Hemsley, Meyer, Canfield, & Maindonald, 1999) and African palm squirrel (Ekele & Niebedum, 2014) . Melanin pigment in P. vampyrus spleen (Figure 3 ) was commonly found in species with black hair like in several rat species (Ward et al., 2018) . This study found that the three species of fruit bats had numerous and wide vascular space containing blood (Figures 3 and   4 ). Tanaka (1990) described Vespertilio's red pulp as having a wide splenic cord and less differentiated vein belonging to a non-sinusal type. This study found that fruit bats have a wider vascular space than splenic cords that resemble sinusal type character. However, further observations using electron microscopes need to be done to confirm this finding. The sinusal type of spleens was reported in rats, humans and dogs (Press & Landsverk, 2006; Udroiu, 2006; Ward et al., 2018) .

C. brachyotis and R. aegyptiacus were reported to have a spleen weight ratio compared to body weight of 0.4% (Attia, El-Desouki, Madkour, Sayed, & El-Refaiy, 2007; Hanadhita, Rahma, Prawira, Sismin Satyaningtijas, & Agungpriyono, 2018) , while rats were 0.2%\u22120.3% (Cesta, 2006) and mice 0.7% (Webster & Liljegren, 1977) . Sinusal spleens with bloodstoring ability are present in camels (Zidan, Kassem, Dougbag, et al., 2000) , hunter dogs (Dane et al., 2006) and humans from bajau tribe (Ilardo et al., 2018) . Chiropteran order had been reported to store blood in the spleen during torpor and hibernation (Nuweller, 2000; Lidicker & Davis, 1955) . Myotis sodalis is reported to have a six times larger spleen and less circulating erythrocyte counts in the inactive phase than when active (Lidicker & Davis, 1955) . Bats are endotherms as the other mammals. Bats with small body mass need to consume a lot of food relative to their body mass to maintain their energy requirements. However, during extreme climate and lack of food supply, bats were able to regulate their temperature to conserve energy by undergoing torpor and hibernation (Altringham, 2011) . Small pteropodids (body weight 16-18 g) in tropical and subtropical climate with warm ambient temperatures can also undergo daily torpor especially when the food source is scarce (Coburn & Geiser, 1998; Geiser & Stawski, 2011; Kelm & Von Helversen, 2007; McNab & Bonaccorso, 2001; Stawski, Willis, & Geiser, 2014) . C. titthaecheilus and R. leschenaultii were medium size pteropodids and the observations done of this two genus showed that they did not undergo daily torpor (Barclay et al., 2017; McNab & Bonaccorso, 2001) . Meanwhile, P. vampyrus is a large size pteropodid which is always at positive energy state; therefore, it does not require torpor (McNab & Bonaccorso, 2001) ; and instead, they fulfil their energy by foraging food all the time (Hengjan et al., 2018) . However, with the capacity of the red pulp vascular space to store blood, all three species of bats might undergo torpor during extreme conditions or in condition when the food is lacking.",

B cells that fail to produce immunoglobulins, experience apoptosis and engulfed by macrophages or called tingible body macrophages (Steiniger & Barth, 2000) can also be found in the centre of the germinal centre of the three bat species , 2004; Lee, Chen, Lin, & Wang, 2011; Mebius & Kraal, 2005; Oehen et al., 2002) . Marginal zones have special resident immune cells consist of marginal zone B cells, marginal metallophilic macrophages and marginal zone macrophages (Bronte & Pittet, 2013; Kraal, 1992) . Marginal zone B cells play a role in the first recognition of viral infection and then produce local antibodies to opsonize pathogens that enter the spleen (Gatto et al., 2004) . Marginal zone macrophages especially have surface receptors that can recognize major components of various enveloped bacteria and several types of viruses (Mebius & Kraal, 2005; Oehen et al., 2002) .",

The ellipsoid structure was not reported in other bat species, Vespertilio orientalis (Tanaka, 1990) . Some ellipsoids gathered and closed together forming an aggregation of macrophages which form white pulp-like structure (Figure 3 ). Ellipsoids can be found in almost all vertebrates except rodents (Steiniger, 2015) . Moles, pigs, cats and dogs have numerous and wide ellipsoids, while horses, cows and sheep have medium ellipsoids sizes (Bacha & Bacha, 2000; Blue & Weiss, 1981; Press & Landsverk, 2006; Snook, 1950) . Ellipsoids have a strategic function as filtration of bloodborne pathogen as well as marginal zones (Blue & Weiss, 1981; Boes & Durham, 2017; Steiniger, 2015) and take a role as a major site of blood pathogen filtration in soft-shelled turtles and chickens that do not possess a marginal zones (Bao, Li, Wang, Qin, & Xu, 2009; Zhang et al., 2015) .",
