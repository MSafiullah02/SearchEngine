Yet it is now recognized that HIV variation is far more extensive than that for influenza A. For example, the variation in the HIV envelope protein gpl 20 is, after some 20 years of the AIDS epidemic, ~threefold greater than the genetic drift associated with the analogous haemagglutinin of the 1968 Hong Kong flu (H3N2) observed during the last ~ 30 years.

Although the mutation rate (errors per base replication cycle) may change, it varies by little more than a factor of 10. 4 For example, those for RNA are perhaps five to eight-fold greater than for retroviruses. 2 Obviously once mutations have occurred selection winnows the field of genetic variants. Some proteins accumulate, or fix, substitutions more or less easily than others. For example, the surface envelope protein fixes substitutions approximately 10 times faster than the SIV integrase protein, s A comparable situation pertains to influenza A where the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase envelope proteins fix mutations faster than either the capsid or non-structural proteins. A signal exception is the hepatitis B virus surface protein (HBsAg) which varies surprisingly little. 6 This is probably due to the fact that the corresponding gene overlaps that of the HIV polymerase, so restricting the number of viable permutations. This would help explain the low frequency of subunit vaccine escape variants, which should otherwise be commonplace.",

For influenza A the virus provokes an acute infection with a limited number of replication cycles before the immune system wipes out the infection. Within this short window the virus has to be transmitted. However, transmission occurs in the face of partial immunity, the host having seen at least some of the epitopes in previous years. Although little is known of the viral dynamics of influenza A infection, virus spread within a partly immunized individual is presumably less than within a naive individual. Indeed the heightened virulence associated with antigenic shift may be understood in this manner. The transmissibility and acute nature of influenza A means that a large number of short infection chains are established in parallel, virtually all of which come to an end as a result of clearance by the immune system. A new epidemic essentially originates from a novel clonal variant as evidenced by the genetic homogeneity of the virus in cross-sectional studies.",

The present AIDS pandemic is proof that such a strategy is viable. There are many parallel chains but this time they may be long and traceable by current genetic methods.",

In fact, these two examples coalesce in the context of influenza A infection of severely immune compromised patients which may be persistent. Antigenically distinct variants were shed during the course of infection. To further emphasize the point that persistence of an RNA viral infection is associated with extensive cross-sectional genetic variability, one only needs to take a look at human hepatitis C or bovine foot and mouth disease viruses to find abundant variation. Despite the wealth of genetic variability there is no evidence that de novo genetic variation is responsible either for HIV persistence or the onset of AIDS. 7'12 Indeed persistence, a mere toehold in an extremely hostile world, of any RNA or retroviral infection is achieved by mechanisms other than generating variation.",

Consequently their properties will be those influenced by fitness differences and selection. Such populations of viral genomes, referred to as viral quasispecies, or simply quasispecies, were modelled mathematically before they received biological confirmation. 15 In culture, viral quasispecies show many of the features of classical population genetics including the competitive exclusion principle, 16 Red Queen hypothesis 17 and Muller's ratchet. 18'19 Fitness selection is ominipresent, the system being essentialy deterministic. As soon as the microenvironment or virological niche changes, the population rapidly adjusts resulting in fitness selection of variants best adapted to the new niche.",

In fact the vast majority of virus (>99%) is eliminated, the infection being sustained only by a small fraction. 8-11 The immune system is exquisitely spatially organized, with antibodies or antigen specific T-cells pouring out of clonal or oligoclonal sites into the periphery, so generating the polyclonal responses. HW infects CD4 Tcell lymphoblasts which are mainly found in the lymphoid organs; its distribution therein reflects this exquisite spatial heterogeneity. 2\u00b0 Consequently virions and variants are not free to diffuse and therefore compete.",

However, the model was invaluable in concentrating attention on the problem of RNA viral evolution. 1S Nowhere was it more helpful than in understanding drug resistance. Application of a drug changes the local optimum. The dominant variants are no longer the fittest allowing outgrowth of the drug resistant form which, by definition, is better adapted to the new niche. It is obvious that the larger the viral population size at the moment of drug administration the greater the probability of selecting a drug resistant form. This was borne out by the finding that AZT resistance was detected earlier among patients with more advanced disease as opposed to those with asymptomatic infection--viral load, and with it the number of variants, is greater during symptomatic as opposed to asymptomatic infection.",

This latter parameter is presently unknown. However, there is an upper limit--the number of permissive cells in the body. There are ~ 5 x 1011 CD4 T-cells in the body of a seronegative patient; factoring in multiple HIV copies per cell, infected macrophages, and the caveat that even in an AIDS patient not all the CD4 T-cells are infected, the m a x i m u m population size appears to be around 101\u00b0 . Armed with mutation and fixation rates is it possible to calculate the minimum population size from which a drug resistant variant will emerge.; The stark truth is that our science is unable to calculate anything precisely. However, a ballpark estimation can be made as follows. Let us assume that we have three drugs, with reasonable pharmacology, low toxicity and devoid of antagonism, each requiring a single point mutation to confer full resistance. The probability of getting a variant simultaneously resistant to all three is (3 x 10-5) 3 or ~3 x 10 -14. Yet this is less than the inverse of the m a x i m u m HIV variant population size (around 101\u00b0). Thus viral control should be possible without the problem of resistance. Despite a host of caveats concerning the distinction between mutation and fixation rates, unequal mutation frequencies, problems of toxicity, compliance etc, the calculation serves to emphasize that the variation is not therapy's inevitable Achilles' heel.",
