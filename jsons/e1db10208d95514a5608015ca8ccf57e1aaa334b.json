The virus circulates in different rodent species, especially voles and wood mice in western Europe.v 11a Cats typically become infected through wounding while hunting these wild mammals. Cat-to-cat, cat-to-human, or cat-to-dog transmission can also occur.

Partial alopecia with scaling. Papularto-plaquelike lesions were also present but are not visible. bite wound, typically on the head, neck, or forelimb. Local viral replication worsens the primary lesions and is the point source for the subsequent viremia. During the viremic phase, some cats develop mild pyrexia, inappetence, and depression. Ten to 14 days after the primary lesion, multiple secondary lesions develop over the body. The secondary or pox lesions are initially macular but progress to ulcerated, papular to nodular lesions that crust rapidly (see Fig. 7 -Ie and D). Pruritus is variable, and approximately 20% of infected cats develop oral vesiculation or ulceration. I. 5 Lesions heal slowly over 3 to 4 weeks and may be permanently scarred. During the development and course of the secondary lesions, systemic signs of illness are uncommon unless the cat has some intercurrent immunosuppressive disease. One cat died of necrotizing pneumonia.s>",

The three most common patterns are granulomatous perifolliculitis, superficial and deep perivascular dermatitis, and interstitial dermatitis. It is common for a dog to have more than one pattern of inflammation present. In the perifollicular pattern, total obliteration of the sebaceous glands occurs in approximately 45% of the cases.

Treatments can bring about a clinical cure, but relapses months to years after treatment are to be expected. These relapses are probably due to incomplete eradication of the parasite, but could also represent reinfection. Accordingly, with the poor prognosis for cure and the possible reservoir status of the dog for human infection, euthanasia may be indicated. In endemic areas, insect control measures can be beneficial in reducing the rate of insect feeding and, hopefully, infection.P When treatment is indicated, the most widely used treatment is meglumine antimonate. 1, 82 Dosages vary with the study and range from 20 to 50 mglkg given subcutaneously twice daily to 200 to 300 mglkg given intravenously every other day.73., 118b, 124, 126 Remission rates approaching 85% can be achieved with a large number of injections.P: 124 but parasitologic cure rates are much lower. Studies in humans and dogs have suggested that the antileishmanial activity of liposome-encapsulated meglumine antimonate is vastly superior to that of the unencapsulated drug. 70, 125 Other drugs that have been used in canine leishmaniasis include aminosidine, 114, 132 amphotericin B,95 allopurinol,67.,97, 129, 130 metronidazole, and ketoconazole.

However, the rate of parasitologic cure is not impacted. The most helpful new treatment is an admixture of chemotherapy and immunotherapy with LiF2 antigen, an antigen derived from L. infantum. 107 Simultaneous use of this antigen and meglumine resulted in parasitologic cure in all cases tested.",
