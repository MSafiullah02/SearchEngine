However, immunological alteration in Fut9 \u2212/\u2212 mice has not been studied. Thus, the inflammatory response of Fut9 \u2212/\u2212 mice was examined using the highly neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHMV srr7 strain. Pathological study revealed that inflammation induced in the brains of Fut9 \u2212/\u2212 mice after infection was more extensive compared with that of wild-type mice, although viral titers obtained from the brains of mutant mice were lower than those of wild-type mice. Furthermore, the reduction in cell numbers in the spleens of wild-type mice after infection was not observed in the infected Fut9 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Although there were no clear differences in the levels of cytokines examined in the brains between Fut9 \u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice except for interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) expression, some of those in the spleens, including interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), showed higher levels in Fut9 \u2212/\u2212 than in wild-type mice. Furthermore, Fut9 \u2212/\u2212 mice were refractory to the in vivo inoculation of endotoxin (LPS) compared with wild-type mice. These results indicate that Le x structures are involved in host responses against viral or bacterial challenges.",

Initial viral antigens can already be detected at 12 h post-inoculation (hpi) either with cl-2 or srr7 in infiltrating cells that appear in the subarachnoidal space and spleen at the same time. All kinds of splenic cells examined were infected. 7 In spite of wide-spread lesions accompanied by viral antigen distribution in the parenchyma of the central nervous system, the inflammatory response is minimal except for in the meningeal area. 6, 8 Besides the neuropathogenicity, srr7 and cl-2 cause marked cell depletion in the spleen after infection. 7 At 24 hpi, the population of leukocytes in the spleen becomes less than 50% of the splenic cell number of uninfected mice, but the reason remains unclear because the infected cell number in the spleen is too small to account for the reduction.",

Murine coronaviruses, particularly MHV, have been used to develop a number of informative animal models to elucidate their highly mutative nature causing different pathogenesis 11, 12 and the mechanisms of acute spread of the viruses. 1, 6, 7 However, studies on the acute phase of infection with MHV have been lacking. 1 In this study, we investigated whether characteristics of the pathology can be changed by modifying the pattern of the carbohydrate structure of the host animals, which contributes to viral infectivity, 13 including MHV infection 14, 15 and immune system function. 13 The studies were carried out with particular relevance to innate immunity, using Fut9 \u2212/\u2212 mice, 16 which lack \u03b11,3-fucosyltransferase 9 and are unable to synthesize the Lewis x (Le x ) structure, because srr7 induces neuropathological lesions during the early phase of infection before adaptive immune responses occur, and the Le x structure is believed to be involved in innate immunity through cell-celland pathogen-recognition. [17] [18] [19] The treatment of patients infected with highly virulent viruses during the early phase of infection includes the control of excessive innate immune responses with or without inflammatory pictures, the latter of which is observed typically in encephalopathy induced by influenza viral infection. 20 Furthermore, Le x and Fut9 are highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). 21, 22 In addition, Fut9 \u2212/\u2212 mice develop normally without gross phenotypic abnormalities in the brain and other organs, 16, 22 which might affect pathological changes induced by neuropathogenic viral infection.",

JHM viruses are known to proliferate, suppressing the production of IFN-\u03b2 in the in vitro-infected cells. [26] [27] [28] Because IFN-\u03b2 levels in the pons were increased after infection both in mutant and wildtype mice, we examined IFN-\u03b2 expression by immunofluorescence, and IFN-\u03b2 was found to be widely distributed in the brain parenchyma, where viral antigens were not detected at 48 hpi, although many infected cells had infiltrated the meninges, as shown in the upper left corner of Fig. 3f . The result indicated that the IFN-\u03b2 after infection is considered to be produced by an indirect bystander effect on the cells in the brain parenchyma.",

            "text": "Extended inflammation in the brain and the rather hyperplastic state in the spleen of infected mutant mice, accompanied by lower viral titration compared to wild-type mice, indicated that mutant mice are more advantageously equipped for viral replication inhibition or viral clearance through inflammatory responses during the early phase of infection than wild-type mice. This indicates that Le X structures play an inhibitory role in inflammation during the acute phase of infection. The finding that viral titers in mutant mice in the brain and liver after infection were lower than those in wild-type mice might be due to the lower infectivity of cells lacking Le X structures, because the major viral receptor, CEACAM1, carries Le X structures. 17 However, in vivo and in vitro examinations revealed that there was no difference in infectivity between wild-type and mutant mice. Therefore, the virological and pathological differences observed in the two strains would more likely result from different immune responses during the initial phase of infection. Initial immune responses after infection are triggered by pathogen recognition through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 29 and various classes of glycan-binding receptor (lectins), 18, 19 leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. A comparison of cytokine production between the two strains revealed that the amounts in the pons and spleen shifted after infection similarly in the two strains were less than 2-fold in almost every case. Therefore, similar survival rates in spite of different viral growth in the brains after infection in the two strains might be caused by the cytokine production being a bystander effect rather than directly due to the injury of infected cells. Bystander effects represented as an elevation of cytokine levels cause a poor prognosis after brain injuries observed in viral infection, such as influenza viral encephalopathy, which exhibits almost no inflammation nor viral growth in the brain, 20 and in other types of brain injury such as stroke. 30 In the spleen, most of the cytokine levels examined in wild-type mice were reduced after infection more markedly than those in mutant mice. However, the differences in levels between wild-type and mutant mice were less than 2-fold in almost every case, which could also be a bystander effect in uninfected areas of the spleen, leading to elevated amounts of IFN-\u03b2 in the whole spleen at 48 hpi both in wild-type and mutant mice, although it has been reported that MHV infection in vitro inhibits IFN-\u03b2-production. [26] [27] [28] There may be a more marked reduction of cytokine production in the spleen of wild-type mice compared to that of mutant mice in the local environment, especially in the interfollicular areas including the marginal zone, where viral antigens are detected during the early phase of infection, 6 and the influx and efflux of leukocytes are controlled through the fibroblastic reticular system. 31 A difference in immediate inflammatory responses of the two strains was observed when mice were challenged by LPS, a ligand of TLR-4, 32,33 to induce lymphadenitis in the regional lymph nodes. In wild-type mice, the inflammatory response against LPS-challenge in the popliteal lymph nodes was tolerated after infection, which did not occur in mutant mice, as far as the size of the lymph nodes was concerned. LPS-tolerance, also known as endotoxin-tolerance, is induced by LPS-challenge accompanied by other immunological treatments, infection, or injury, 34, 35 and is caused by inhibitory cascades activated after the recognition of ligands by PRRs, 34, 36 which play an important role in immunological homeostasis, suppressing excess immune responses activated through positive cascades triggered by the activation of PRRs. 36 The Le x structure might be involved in the negative cascades in the PRR pathway, causing more severe inflammation in the mutant mice after viral infection than in wildtype mice. The possibility that a lack of Le x causes increased inflammatory responses after up-regulation of the positive cascades in the PRR-pathway is unlikely, because mutant mice were refractory to in vivo challenge by LPS. Furthermore, most of the levels of cytokines examined after in vitro stimulation by LPS using leukocytes derived from naive mutant mice were lower or similar compared to those from wild-type mice. However, the production of IFNs was greater in the culture of leukocytes derived from mutant compared to wild-type mice, which excludes the possibility that mutant mice poorly recognize LPS. Collectively, challenges by viral infection and/or LPS induced different inflammatory or immune responses between wild-type and mutant mice during the early phase after the challenges. The differences are not believed to be a result of different ligand-receptor affinities, but are more likely caused by differences in down-stream cascades, which are responsible for the down-regulation of excess immune responses triggered by the activation of PRRs. 36 Our experimental model would provide an opportunity to study the in vivo regulatory mechanism, which involves fucosylated glycans, causing the inhibition or enhancement of inflammation.",
