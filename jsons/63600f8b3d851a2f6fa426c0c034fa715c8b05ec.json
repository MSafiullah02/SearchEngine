The effect of resultant dog health programmes on Aboriginal health has been the focus of considerable debate. The main concern is that Aboriginal health funding is redirected to dog health under the assumption that improving dog health will improve community health (Currie, 1995) . The debate was largely extinguished in the Northern Territory following the research conducted by Walton et al. (1999 Walton et al. ( , 2004 , that used microsatellite typing to show that scabies mites from dogs and humans group separately in a phylogenetic dichotomous tree which they suggested demonstrated separate transmission cycles. The ramifications of this have been that many communities are now under the impression that dogs pose no significant public health risks. Several reviews have been published trying to assess this risk, but none have explained their methods, nor critiqued the research using a specified system (Currie, 1995; Gaskin, Bentham, Cromar, & Fallowfield, 2007; Raw, 2001) . Zoonotic and public health literature reviews have been scrutinized for their lack of methodological soundness in review techniques, because they are more likely to contain bias or errors (Waddell et al., 2009 ).

The mosquito transmits infective larvae (L3) when it subsequently feeds on a human, the secondary host. In the dog, the larvae mature in the muscle sheath, subcutaneous and adipose tissue to L5 stage and the immature adults migrate to the heart and pulmonary artery where they mature to adults.

A coordinated approach is necessary and dog health should be added to the list of potentially hazardous environmental issues to be addressed within Aboriginal communities. Dog health programmes are still extremely important for animal welfare and providing relevant information to pet owners in Aboriginal Australian communities regardless of zoonotic potential.Furthermore, as there can be no disputing the significant problem of dog bites as a serious canine zoonotic issue(Abreu & D'adonna, 2009); the safety of community members from pack dogs should be motivation enough for the employment of animal control officers in Aboriginal communities.Despite 30 years of dog health programmes, and over 40 years of research, we could only find 19 studies that had published their findings in peer-reviewed journals. We are aware of many other research projects which have been conducted in Aboriginal communities, such as that ofWilks and Williamson (1998), but the results of these studies could not be found in peer-reviewed journals and may result in research being repeated in an already over-researched Aboriginal population. In addition, the small amount of comparative studies conducted almost never included people and dogs from the same household. Studies which only used culled dogs for isolates are not always reliable as most are stray dogs with minimal human contact. While it can be assumed that funding constraints make it difficult to invest time in building relationships and employing local Aboriginal research assistants and research candidates, the benefits of local knowledge would far outweigh these issues and ensure an accurate sample of the community as a whole, improving the quality, extent and impact of research results.
