In 2004, Baltussen and Kindler [16] published citation classics of the critical care literature and enumerated the 71 top-cited articles in critical care journals and the 45 top-cited critical care articles in non\u2013critical care journals. This article was somewhat limited by the number of citations referenced as well as the absence of specific critical care topic citations groups. The first and primary aim of this study was to expand on Baltussen's earlier work and provide an updated and more comprehensive catalogue of the most influential articles pertaining to critical care medicine and within specific categories of critical care, something not done in previous studies of this type. We also examined the methods used to retrieve articles to provide an exhaustive search method that future researchers may use in modern electronic databases to find frequently cited critical care articles.",

These searches by specific disease or conditions added 404 articles to the master database as 194 articles were already in the database from either the initial search or from the journal search. From this master database of 1187 articles, we then generated a list of all articles cited more than 150 times (Table 2\n). We organized this table by topics particularly relevant to critical care.

            "text": "This study, like previous ones focusing on citations, has several limitations. Perhaps the most relevant is the debate as to what constitutes the most influential articles within a professional discipline [1], [4], [18]. Citation data found in all bibliographic databases rely not only on correctly acquiring cited references but also on the assumption that a primary study cites other references that are most relevant to the published article. It is likely that this study captured many of the classic articles in critical care as each article in our list of the top 200 articles was cited at least 300 times. Considering that 46% of articles published in medicine are never even cited, this is a remarkable observation [19]. Certainly, these articles deserve attention and must have made an indelible impact. However, this is not always the case. Authors may preferentially cite their or their colleagues' previous works both because of familiarity or to increase the citation of that article. Recent scholarship on social networks, especially in the age of accelerated knowledge transmission, suggests that there may be an enhanced level of \u201cconnectedness\u201d related to these networks [20], [21]. It is not known whether, or how, this connectedness may be influencing the dissemination and therefore the pattern of references within the critical care community or among specific critical care topics. However, it is possible that the pattern of some citations may reflect the influence of an individual, as some have referred to as the \u201cceremonial citation,\u201d rather than the specific findings within an article [16], [22], [23]. In addition, authors are more likely to cite articles of their own language [8], [24] or articles that come from a highly cited journal. Not surprisingly, Baltussen found that among the most cited 45 articles, most of them came from non\u2013critical care-focused journals [16]. Nevertheless, using citations as a proxy for influence and importance has both face validity and is supported by empiric data demonstrating that citation analyses correlate with articles with the highest quality hierarchies of evidence and research design [25].",

Once citations do peak, they eventually become part of common knowledge and are no longer cited. Previous studies suggest that articles peak 7 to 10 years after publication [15], [26]. It has been suggested that \u201cclassic\u201d articles are relevant to only a few decades and many important articles are lost to the passage of time [15]. These findings may be supported by the fact that among the top 200 articles in this study, 158 were published during or after 2000. It is probably too early to tell how electronic databases will change the epidemiology of citation classics because it is easier to retrieve and perhaps cite influential articles than before the age of the Internet.",
