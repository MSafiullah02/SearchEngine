            "text": "Figure\u00a01: Country-specific COVID-19 epidemic curves and population mortality rates (data based on https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Black circle shows the numbers of daily new confirmed cases in logarithmic scale. Red triangle shows cumulative mortality rate per 100,000 population. (A) Countries experienced large COVID-19 outbreaks and initially responded with a mitigation strategy. (B) Countries experienced large COVID-19 outbreaks and responded with a containment strategy. A comparison of (A) and (B) shows that Italy, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany all had a similar epidemic curve and cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by May 3, 2020. Nevertheless, Germany had a total death toll and case fatality rate approximately one-fourth of that of countries adopting a mitigation strategy (Germany: 6866 [4.1%] vs. Italy: 28,884 [13.7%]; Spain: 25,264 [10.2%]; United Kingdom: 28,446 [15.2%]; and France: 24,895 [14.8%], by May 3, 2020). In term of mortality rate per 100,000 population, the difference is even more remarkable (Germany: 8.2 in contrast to Italy: 47.8; Spain: 54.0; United Kingdom: 41.9; and France: 38.1; by May 3, 2020). (C) Countries initially did not experience a large COVID-19 outbreak: Japan (responded with a mitigation strategy) versus Taiwan (responded with a containment strategy). By May 3, 2020, Japan suffered a large COVID-19 outbreak, while Taiwan did not (cumulative confirmed cases: 14,877 vs. 432). Japan also had a population mortality rate 15-fold higher than that in Taiwan (0.385 vs. 0.025 per 100,000 population).",
