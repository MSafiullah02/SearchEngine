The cap structure has several important biological roles, such as protecting mRNA from degradation by 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exoribonucleases (Schwer et al., 1998) and directing pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export from the nucleus (Darnell, 1979). In addition, the cap structure confers stability to mRNAs and ensures their efficient recognition by translation initiation factor 4F for translation (Filipowicz et al., 1976, Schibler and Perry, 1977). In contrast, host and virus RNA molecules with unprotected 5\u2032-ends are degraded in cytoplasmic compartments (Liu and Kiledjian, 2006). Uncapped RNAs, such as nascent viral transcripts, may also be detected as \u201cnon-self\u201d by the RNA sensors RIG-I, Mda-5, and IFIT in host cells (Abbas et al., 2013, Bowzard et al., 2013, Hornung et al., 2006, Zust et al., 2011), triggering antiviral innate immune responses through the production of interferon or IFIT (interferon-induced protein)-mediated antiviral activity (Daffis et al., 2010, Nallagatla et al., 2008, Rehwinkel et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs), infect many species of animals, including humans, and cause acute or chronic respiratory diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] (de Groot et al., 2013, Zaki et al., 2012), and infectious bronchitis virus [IBV], enteric diseases (e.g., transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV]), and central nervous system (CNS) diseases (murine hepatitis virus [MHV]) (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). CoVs are the largest RNA viruses, are enveloped, and contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 27 to 31.5 kb in length. The genome of SARS-CoV contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) (Snijder et al., 2003) and generates 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) produced by the autocatalytic processing of the polyprotein by 2 viral proteases (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). CoVs replicate in the host cytoplasm and encode their own capping enzymes. Among the four capping enzymes involved in coronavirus m7GpppAm-cap formation, guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) was identified as nsp14 in our previous work using a yeast genetic system (Chen et al., 2009), and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase) is formed by nsp16 with nsp10 as a cofactor (Chang et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2011, Decroly et al., 2011, Lugari et al., 2010). SARS-coronavirus nsp14 was previously characterized as a 3\u2032- to 5\u2032-exoribonuclease (ExoN) (Chen et al., 2007, Minskaia et al., 2006), and the N7-MTase domain was mapped to the carboxy-terminal part of the protein (Chen et al., 2009). Interestingly, the ExoN active site is dispensable, though the ExoN domain is required for N7-MTase activity. The combination of the two functional domains (Chen et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2013), a unique feature among all N7-MTases, indicates that SARS-CoV N7-MTase is a novel form of RNA-processing enzyme and thus suggests it as an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs.",

For the soil or lichen, 1 mg was quantified and placed into a tube containing 10 ml of sterilized sodium lauryl sulfate solution and shaken for 1 min.

The microbial identity will be further characterized by classical and molecular methodology when active compounds are identified from the corresponding microbial extracts. For preparation of the microbial extracts, each microbial isolate was fermented in 200 ml fermentation medium and the resulting cultures were extracted with ethyl acetate. For making the working solution of the microbial extracts, the extracts were dissolved in ethanol to a concentration of 1 mg/ml (w/v). In total, 3000 microbial culture extracts were used for MTase inhibitor screening in this study, which were prepared from actinomycetes and fungi.",

            "text": "Our previous study showed that SARS-CoV nsp14 possesses N7-MTase activity that could substitute for cellular N7-MTase in yeast (Chen et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2013). In this system, the gene Abd1 encoding yeast N7-MTase is knocked out from the yeast genome and complemented by expression of Abd1 from a plasmid with a URA3 selective marker, resulting in yeast strain YBS40, whereas the exogenous N7-MTase is expressed from another plasmid with a Trp selective marker. The expression of a functional URA3 gene encoding orotine-5\u2032-monophosphate decarboxylase results in the conversion of the nontoxic 5-FOA compound to toxic 5-flurouracil in yeast. In a medium containing 5-FOA, which counter-selects URA3-expressing cells, the yeast cells can grow normally only when the exogenous protein can replace the function of the cellular N7-MTase (Fig. 1\nA). In this study, we confirmed that SARS-CoV and human N7-MTase could rescue the growth of yeast cells that were deficient in N7-MTase. We further tested whether this N7-MTase activity is universal for nsp14 from other coronaviruses. As shown in Fig. 1B, nsp14 from other coronaviruses, including TGEV (group 1), MHV (group 2a), SARS-CoV (group 2b), MERS-CoV (group 2c), and IBV (group 3), showed N7-MTase activity that was functional in vivo by complementing the endogenous yeast enzyme. These results indicate that N7-MTase is well conserved among different coronaviruses and that nsp14 appears to be a target for the development of a universal inhibitor against coronaviruses. We then generated three yeast strains that grew dependently on the N7-MTase activity from SARS-CoV (MT-SARS), humans (MT-human), and yeast (MT-yeast).",

The mRNA of MT-yeast, which was transformed with pMceK294A vector as control, is similar with yeast train YBS40, because the mRNAs of yeast N7-MTases are transcribed from the complementary plasmids (URA3) bearing the yeast-MT. In the strains with MT-SARS and MT-human, the expression of yeast N7-MTase could not be detected (data not shown). As the expression of MT-SARS and MT-human is at the similar level, these yeast strains could be used to identify the inhibitors that inhibit SARS-CoV MTase more potently than human MTase. However, the mRNA levels of MT-SARS and MT-human are four times higher than that of MT-yeast, the latter being expressed from a low-copy-number plasmid with centromeric element (Cen), the inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV and yeast MTases cannot be directly compared.",

Individual colonies of MT-Yeast, MT-Human, and MT-SARS were cultured in a medium lacking tryptophan, and the pre-cultures were diluted with fresh medium to an A\n595\n = 0.01. A 100-\u03bcl aliquot of the culture was incubated in each well of two 96-well plates, one of which was used for measuring yeast propagation by spectrophotometry, whereas the other plate was used for the direct counting of the cell number. Measurements were performed at 4-h intervals over 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1D and E, all three yeast strains (MT-SARS, MT-human, and MT-yeast) showed similar growth curves within 48 h, indicating that both the SARS-CoV and human MTases could support the normal growth of yeast cells. At such a growth condition, starting with a liquid culture at A\n595\n = 0.01, the time period between 4 and 24 h corresponded to the logarithmic growth phase (Fig. 1D and E). During this growth phase, the optical density (A\n595) was well correlated with the cell number as demonstrated for the yeast strain MT-SARS by linear regression analysis (Fig. 1F). In the linear regression equation, y\n = 8.60359x \u2212 0.67266 (R\n2\n = 0.924, R\n2 is regressive coefficient), it shows that there is a correlativity between the A\n595 of culture liquid and cell number in the logarithmic phase (4\u201324 h) of MT-SARS when the R\n2\n > 0.9. Similarly, there was also a high correlativity between the two optical absorbance and the cell number for strains MT-Yeast and MT-Human, with linear regression equations y\n = 8.379x \u2212 1.0337 (R\n2\n = 0.926) and y\n = 8.514x \u2212 0.6286 (R\n2\n = 0.922), respectively.

We first detected the N7-MTase activities of coronaviruses nsp14 in vitro when incubated with different compounds at 100 \u03bcM using biochemical assays. As shown in Fig. 2\nA, sinefungin effectively inhibits the activities of all four N7-MTases and AdoHcy and ATA weakly inhibit the N7-MTase activities of SARS, MHV and TGEV with approximately 45\u201370% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM, except for IBV with 10\u201330% inhibition. In contrast, ribavirin, which is a guanosine (ribonucleic) analog used to interfere with viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping of many different viruses (Kim and Lee, 2013, Scholtissek, 1976, Zhao et al., 2012), did not inhibited the coronavirus N7-MTases. The dose\u2013response curve of sinefungin, which was the best inhibitor of the three effective compounds, showed an IC50 value of sinefungin against SARS-CoV nsp14 of 383.4 \u00b1 7.54 nM (Fig. 2B). Sinefungin could widely inhibit the activities of MTases from diverse sources including viruses and yeast. For example, the IC50 values of sinefungin for N7-MTase and 2\u2032O-MTases of Vaccinia virus in vitro are 12.0 and 39.5 nM, respectively (Pugh et al., 1978), and the IC50 values for 2\u2032O-MTase (NS5MTase) activity of Dengue virus in vitro are 420 nM (Li et al., 2007) and 630 nM (Selisko et al., 2010). The IC50 values of sinefungin for yeast N7-MTase are 55 nM in vivo (Chrebet et al., 2005) and 24 nM in vitro (Zheng et al., 2007), respectively. It was reported previously that the IC50 values of AdoHcy are 1 and 0.5 mM for N7-MTase and 2\u2032O-MTases activities of Vaccinia virus in vitro, respectively (Pugh and Borchardt, 1982). In this study, the inhibitory effects of sinefungin, AdoHcy and ATA on MTases were consistent with that of previous reports.",

Remarkably, sinefungin significantly repressed the growth of all three yeast strains (Fig. 3), confirming the previous report of sinefungin as a potent inhibitor (Chrebet et al., 2005, Li et al., 2007, Pugh et al., 1978). In contrast, ATA, AdoHcy, and ribavirin did not exhibit inhibitory activities against the three yeast strains. Because AdoHcy and ATA could inhibit the activity of coronavirus N7-MTase in biochemical assays, the results showed a clear difference between in vitro biochemical assays and in vivo cell-based assays, indicating that N7-MTase inhibitors identified using in vitro biochemical assays may not necessarily be effective within a cellular context. Such discrepancy may be attributed to the low membrane permeability to AdoHcy and ATA or that the IC50 of AdoHcy and ATA are far greater than 100 \u03bcM. Indeed, sinefungin has been reported to be actively transported across yeast membranes, whilst AdoHcy and ATA are not (Zheng et al., 2006, Zheng et al., 2007).",

As shown in Fig. 3, sinefungin exhibited a similar inhibitory effect on all three yeast strains at high concentration (100 \u03bcM). However, stronger inhibitory effect on MT-Yeast was observed than that on MT-Human and the strains harboring the MTases of other coronaviruses at low concentration (0.1 \u03bcM) (Fig. 4\nA and B). This could be explained by intrinsic difference of inhibitory effect to different MTases or the difference of the expression levels of the MTases as we showed that higher mRNA levels of MT-Human and MTases of coronaviruses were expressed than that of MT-yeast (Fig. 1C). To further characterize sinefungin as an MTase inhibitor in the yeast-based system, yeast strain YBS40, expressing different N7-MTases, was incubated with sinefungin at different concentration for 20 h (Fig. 4C and D). The IC50 (n\n = 3, mean values \u00b1 SD) of MT-Yeast, MT-Human and MTases of coronaviruses were calculated and shown in Table 1\n. These results indicate that sinefungin is a broad-spectrum inhibitor against various species of N7-MTases, including those from yeasts, humans, and coronaviruses and demonstrate that the yeast-based system could be used for analysis of N7-MTase inhibitors. However, sinefungin is not an ideal antiviral inhibitor due to its lack of specificity on coronavirus N7-MTases compared to yeast and human MTases. Therefore, it is still necessary to screen for specific viral N7-MTases inhibitors, an effort that will benefit the functional study of viral MTases and clinical drug development.",

The microbial extracts were prepared from liquid culture of actinomycetes and fungi as described in the Materials and Methods section. The overnight cultures of MT-Yeast, MT-Human, and MT-SARS were diluted to A595\n = 0.01, and a 100-\u03bcL aliquot of each cell culture was seeded into 96-well microtiter plates in the presence of 30 \u03bcg/ml of microbial natural product extract. Twenty hours post-incubation, the cell density was monitored by measuring the optical density at A\n595. In the first round, the extracts that did not repress MT-Human were selected for further testing. The primary candidate extracts were tested twice for reproducibility and inhibitory effects using independent samples of each extract. In summary, we obtained three candidates extracts, PF35468 (natural product extract from a fungus species, preliminarily characterized as Penicillium spp.), PA48202 and PA48523 (natural product extracts from actinomycetes, preliminarily characterized as Streptomyces spp.), which could potently inhibit the growth of MT-SARS and MT-yeast but significantly less effectively inhibit MT-Human (Fig. 5\n). The inhibition ratios of the 3 extracts on MT-SARS to MT-Human were 3.5, 3, and 9, respectively. In contrast, sinefungin suppressed the growth of all 3 yeast strains at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM (3.81 \u03bcg/ml). The fungal and actinomyces natural product extracts used in this study were composed of complex ingredients, and these three extracts could be used for the isolation of the active ingredients in future work. Taken together, the yeast-based assay system could provide a platform for screening N7-MTase inhibitors that are more effective against viral MTases and less effective against human MTases.",

To explore the possibility of miniaturizing the yeast-based assay and to increase its throughput scale, yeast cells were seeded in 384-well microtiter plates, and the growth of the MT-SARS yeast cells was monitored at 4-h intervals over 48 h at 30 \u00b0C in a shaker (Fig. 6\nA and B). During the logarithmic growth phase (4\u201324 h), the optical density of the culture at A595 was well correlated with the cell number (Fig. 6A\u2013C). The following linear regression equation was established for the MT-SARS strain: y\n = 8.82419x \u2212 0.12315 (R\n2\n = 0.992), indicating that they are more correlative in 384-well microtiter plates than 96-well microtiter plates (Fig. 6C). To validate the yeast-based system for the high-throughput screening of inhibitors against N7-MTases, we performed a growth suppression assay and measured the IC50 of sinefungin against the 6 yeast strains that had been tested in the 96-well format (Fig. 6D and E). The IC50 values (n\n = 3, mean values \u00b1 SD) for sinefungin against MT-Yeast, MT-Human, MT-SARS, MT-MHV, MT-TGEV, and MT-IBV were 39.18 \u00b1 12.13 nM, 623 \u00b1 1.36 nM, 1621 \u00b1 2.14 nM, 1349 \u00b1 3.33 nM, 1398 \u00b1 1.34 nM, and 1430 \u00b1 4.87 nM, respectively (Table 1), which were highly consistent with that of the 96-well microtiter plates (Fig. 4, Fig. 6 and Table 1). These results indicate that the yeast-based high-throughput screening system could be used for the discovery of specific antiviral inhibitors. In comparison to the 96-well microplate assays, the 384-well assay system was more reliable, and cost effective.",

Among these three strains, sinefungin was more effective against MT-Yeast than MT-SARS (Fig. 4). Thus, the observed differences between in vitro biochemical assays and yeast-based assays indicate that the inhibitors identified by an in vitro biochemical assay may not be effective in cells.

The growth suppression in percentage was calculated as [(X \u2212 Y)/X] \u00d7 100% where X is the A595 value of the mock culture and Y is the A595 value in the presence of sinefungin or microbial natural product extracts. The experiments were repeated three times. The results are shown as the percent suppression of cell growth of yeast strains MT-SARS, MT-human, and MT-Yeast.",
