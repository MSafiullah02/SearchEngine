Special focus is on the spatial spread between subpopulations arranged on a lattice. In veterinary or plant epidemiology such data arise from so-called transmission experiments, where one or more individuals in a controlled environment are inoculated with the infectious disease pathogen. Subsequently, the course of the epidemic is monitored through visual inspection, clinical testing and other methods. The aim ranges in veterinary epidemiology from quantifying disease transmission (Laevens et al., 1999, St\u00e4rk et al., 2000) to determining the effect of a vaccine (Dewulf et al., 2001, Meyns et al., 2004).",

A spatial dimension is introduced by assuming that the k units are arranged in a k=k1\u00d7k2 lattice. At the beginning of the outbreak, t=0, the number of susceptibles in each unit is S(0)=(n1,\u2026,nk), the number of exposed is E(0)=(m1,\u2026,mk) and the number of infectious is I(0)=(0,\u2026,0).

Furthermore, \u03b2 quantifies the within unit transmission rate, whilst \u03b2n quantifies the transmission rate between neighboring units. If a susceptible meets an infectious it becomes exposed. After being exposed at time Ej an individual j has a gamma-distributed incubation time TEj\u223cGa(\u03b3E,\u03b4E) before becoming infectious, i.e. starting from time Ij=Ej+TEj, j can infect others. Similarly, the infectious period lasts for TIj\u223cGa(\u03b3I,\u03b4I) after which recovery occurs, hence Rj=Ij+TIj labels the time of recovery.",

Code wise, this is accomplished by creating an object of class LBExperiment using the simulate function. Several visualizations of the experiment data can then be generated by plot, e.g. the type=state\n\u223c\ntime\n|\nposition argument shows Su(t),Eu(t) and Iu(t) as a function of time for each unit u in the lattice. The below stated code creates a simulated epidemic in a 1\u00d73 lattice, see Fig. 2\n. Initially S(0)=(10,9,10) and E(0)=(0,1,0). Further views of LBExperiment objects can be generated using type=state\n\u223c\ntime or type=state\n\u223c\n1\n|\nposition as arguments in plot. The former shows S(t),E(t) and I(t), with e.g. S(t)=\u2211u=1kSu(t), the latter creates an animation illustrating the course of the epidemic by plotting the state given position for a set of fixed time points. As exemplification, the code below uses a 8\u00d716 lattice with 15 individuals in each unit (a realistic setup for a pig farm) and creates a 20-picture animation of the epidemic. Fig. 3\nshows the eighth picture of this sequence: Each stacked bar shows the current (t=58.9 days) percentage of susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered in the unit. \n",

For example, the general multitype SEIR model (Andersson and Britton, 2000, Chapter 6) allows for more complicated neighbor dependencies: Letting \u039b(\u03b1) be a k\u00d7k matrix given as a function of the parameter vector \u03b1, the transmission rates are given by \u03bb(t)=\u039b(\u03b2)I(\u03b2ij)\u2032. Nearest neighborhood transmission as in (1) thus corresponds to \u039bij=\u03b2I(ui=uj)+\u03b2nI(uj\u2208N(uj)) and hence \u03b1=(\u03b2,\u03b2n). An alternative would be to let transmission from neighbors be a function of distance: \u039bij=\u03b11exp(-\u03b12dist(ui,uj)). Modifications of the Java code to handle the simulation and maximum likelihood estimation in such models should be feasible. However, obtaining MCMC estimates in case of missing data would require a substantial amount of work. The same comment applies if one wants to extend beyond the currently implemented waiting time distributions (gamma-distributed, exponential-distributed and constant).",
