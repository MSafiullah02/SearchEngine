            "text": "Patients on haemodialysis present with a high infectious morbidity, enhanced carcinoma incidence, impaired wound healing and reduced effect of vaccination\u2014diseases that are directly related to the function of the immune system [1\u20134]. Immunological abnormalities of leukocytes have been described in patients on dialysis [5]. Mphi (monocytes/ macrophages) are major effectors of the immune system with widespread microbicidal and tumoricidal functions that are altered in uraemia [6\u20138]. Uraemic immunodeficiency is a complication of renal failure reflecting stress, e.g. exerted by as yet poorly defined uraemic toxins, imbalances of antioxidants and pro-oxidants, malnutrition or iron overload, membrane bio-incompatibility and inflammation [9\u201311]. Therefore, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suffer from increased oxidative stress, which can only be ineffectively treated by haemodialysis [12\u201314]. The response of human cells to stress, e.g. heat shock (HS), is a highly conserved adaptive cell response found in all cells in all life forms conferring resistance to different stressors, i.e. increased temperature (fever), nutritional deficiency, oxidative stress or hypoxia [15\u201317]. The corresponding heat shock proteins (HSPs), like the major stress-inducible family member HSP72 (70-kDa HSP, inducible HSP70, HSPA1A, HSP70-1) [18], can also be found in cells under normal physiological conditions controlling the folding of proteins. Constitutively expressed HSP70 (Hsc70) binds to newly translated immature proteins and prevents premature and improper binding and folding [19\u201321]. This is vital, since HSP72-deficient animals are susceptible to stress or even not viable [22]. In response to stress, housekeeping activities of HSPs, e.g. degradation of unstable and misfolded proteins, control of regulatory proteins or transport of proteins, switch towards reaction against stress to increase the cell's chance of survival. The cellular injury decreases, either by induction of cytoresistance or by enhancement of repair mechanisms [18]. Thus, HSP72 induction confers protection even against sublethal damage causing apoptosis and is, therefore, referred to as a cellular lifeguard. We and others showed HSP72-dependent injury protection of monocytes [23,24]. Of note, housekeeping functions of HSPs are critically involved, e.g. as potent immune adjuvants, into the innate and adaptive immune response in inflammation, infection and tumour defence [25\u201330]. In the case of infection, HSP72 induction is even crucial keeping Mphi alive and, therefore, capable for anti-hazardous actions [31\u201333]. Several factors and pathways have been identified as responsible triggers causing immunodeficiency in patients with ESRD [8,34,35]. But still, the underlying mechanisms determining Mphis\u2019 dysfunction are complex and remain, to a certain extent, unknown. Thus, they are addressed in this study. Having identified a reduced stress-related HSP72 response in Mphi of rats with chronic kidney disease, we used HS, as a simple model of fever/stress, to investigate the capacity of HSP72 induction in Mphi of patients on intermittent haemodialysis (IHD).",

Patients\u2019 Mphi were compared to those of 37 apparently healthy volunteers (23 males) on no medication, who presented no complaints or active pathology with a mean age of 32 (CTR, range 22\u201359) years. There was no statistically significant difference in age among the groups studied. Patients had haemoglobin levels between 11.5 and 13.5 g/dl, treated with erythropoietin (epoetin alpha: 0\u201324 000 I.E., median 10 000 I.E./week i.v.) and intravenous iron, and standard heparin anticoagulation. Blood pressure was controlled, whereas 23 patients received a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and/or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, respectively, to reach normotension. Patients received haemodialysis for 4 h on three occasions each week for more than 12 months, using polysulfone membranes (F8, FMC, Bad Homburg, Germany) and bicarbonate dialysate (32 mmol/l) containing 138 mM Na+, 3.0 mM K+, 1.5 mM Ca2+, 0.5 mM Mg2+, 111 mM Cl\u2212 and glucose 1 g/l (SK-F 313/1, FMC). Dialysate flow rate was 500 ml/min and blood flow >250 ml/min. Patients had primary arteriovenous fistulae (radiocephalic or brachiocephalic), and two needles were used for each dialysis session. The renal diagnoses were nephrosclerosis (n = 10), inactive glomerulonephritis (n = 7), interstitial nephritis (n = 5), polycystic kidney disease (n = 3), renal failure related to chronic heart failure (n = 3) and diabetic nephropathy (n = 2), and in seven patients the reason remained undefined. In both groups, the exclusion criteria were as follows: haemodialysis duration <12 months, PTH >400 pg/ml, evidence of infection, neoplasia or liver disease. Patients on antibiotic, antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs were also excluded. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the M\u00fcnster University Hospital, M\u00fcnster, Germany.",

What is known so far is that the mechanism cannot be broken down to a single effector. The pathways are rather complex and not yet fully understood. Interestingly, HSP72 induction acts not only anti-apoptotic but influences Mphis\u2019 phagocytosis capacity and resistance to intracellular infection, too [26,29,42,43]. Memoli et al. stated that the impaired immunocompetence observed in Mphi of patients on IHD results from \u2018chronic over-stimulation\u2019 caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines, complement activation and toxins, conducting a decreased resonance against further stimulation (fatigue) [35]. Nevertheless, we could neither detect dialysis session-dependent HSP72 induction (stimulation) nor find elevated baseline HSP72 in patients (Figures 4 and 8) or rats with renal insufficiency (Figure 2). Recently, and in contrast to our data, Calabrese et al. measured elevated HSP70 level in lymphocytes of patients with diabetic nephropathy [44]. As diabetes-related stress and patient's metabolism considerably differ between diabetic and non-diabetic patients and the measurements were performed on EDTA-treated lymphocytes (leading via calcium efflux to pre- and de-activation of cellular pathways), the results may vary. Further, monocytes of patients on peritoneal dialysis exhibit significant HS response after contact with peritoneal dialysis fluid meaning that they are not over-stimulated [45]. Unfortunately, this study lacks the healthy controls.",

Maddock and Westenfelder charged protein carbamylation for being the trigger [50]. Interestingly, the HS response returned to zero by 48 h assuming some kind of cellular adaptation in the long run. This is in agreement with our data, showing the same baseline amounts of HSP72 in Mphi of healthy rats and those with increased serum BUN (Figure 2), in urea-treated Mphi (Figure 6), as well as in patients and controls (Figures 4 and 5). Consistent with Marzec et al. [45], monocytes from rats with renal insufficiency and from patients on IHD responded to HS but, in the case of HSP72, to a significantly lower extent than the ones from controls (Figures 2, 4, and 5). In contrast, skeletal muscle of chronic dialysis patients in the steady state contains increased amounts of protective HS proteins [51]. Notably, HSP72 expression in long-term urea-incubated Mphi responded to a significant higher extent to HS than controls (Figure 6). A possible explanation for urea-induced HSP72 expression in heated Mphi is that urea-mediated protein destabilization may be enhanced by increased temperature. Since disruption of the protein tertiary structure is the final common pathway of HSP induction, this mechanism could also account for urea-induced HSP72 expression at high temperature [52].",

Uraemia changes plasma and intracellular amino acid levels further whereas IHD alters protein turnover and amino acid transport kinetics [53]. In critically ill patients, a decreased plasma glutamine level causes an impaired monocyte function leading to substantial immunosuppression [54,55]. Glutamine deprivation increases Mphi\u2019 susceptibility to stress and apoptosis, as well as it reduces their responsiveness to stimuli [55]. Glutamine starving reduces thermoresistance (to fever) of Mphi that is, according to Pollheimer et al., caused by impaired HSP70 response [54]. Thus, one can assume that glutamine depletion contributes to the reduced HSP72-HS response and favours apoptosis as demonstrated in patients\u2019 Mphi (Figure 7). Nevertheless, accelerated efflux of amino acids from the muscle (protein catabolism) helps to stabilize the intracellular concentrations of amino acids during IHD [53]. Further, we performed all experiments in CM containing 2 mM L-glutamine excluding undersupply and effects were already present in the rat model of chronic kidney disease. Hence, glutamine starvation is probably not involved.",

Only in the presence of erythropoietin, HSP70 protected erythroid precursors from caspase-mediated proteolysis [58]. As erythropoietin is an integral part of the pharmacological therapy in ESRD, one can speculate that in untreated ESRD patients the HSP70 response might be worse and apoptosis even elevated. In addition, the HSP72 response was already impaired in the rat model excluding medications being the main underlying trigger altering Mphi's stress response.",
