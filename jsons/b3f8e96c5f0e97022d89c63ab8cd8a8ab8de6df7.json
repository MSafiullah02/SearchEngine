            "text": "Telemedicine in a post-COVID world: How eConsults can be used to augment an allergy practice 1 Justin Greiwe, MD 1 Sanofi Genzyme and has received consulting fees from AstraZeneca. 14 As allergy practices across the country deal with the clinical and financial consequences of 15 there is a growing reliance on technology to effectively care for patients and provide a much-needed 16 revenue source to keep practices solvent. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the care provided 17 using these platforms can be just as effective and meaningful as an in-person visit. While we have had 18 the technology to perform telemedicine visits for years, patients' indifference, technological acumen 19 and access, as well as poor insurance reimbursement have been barriers for widespread acceptance. In live telemedicine visits, these consultations are not currently very lucrative and could be serving to 61 marginalize the value of specialty healthcare in the United States. With the increasing reliance on 62 telehealth services it is essential that future telemedicine compensation structure is commensurate with 63 the clinical knowledge being provided. 64 Importantly, eConsults attempt to address the alarming lack of access to specialty expertise, especially 65 in underserved and geographically isolated regions. Furthermore, they offer many advantages including 66 reduced waiting times for appointment scheduling, reduced travel time to and from the physician's 67 office and patient waiting time once in the office, reduced missed work and costs associated with 68 childcare which are often required when going to see a physician. All of these benefits translate into cost 69",

            "text": "20 response to the pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services relaxed many requirements GREIWE 2 for Medicare patients and the states soon followed suit for Medicaid patients. Insurance companies also 22 loosened restrictions giving healthcare providers increased flexibility to provide remote patient care, 23 although not to the extent of Medicare/Medicaid as new patients cannot be seen by live video 24 telemedicine visits and out of state established patients also are not permitted to be seen unless the 25 physician has a license in that state. Currently the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of 26 Health and Human Services is exercising its enforcement discretion to not impose penalties for 27 noncompliance with the HIPAA Rules in connection with the good faith provision of telehealth using 28 such non-public facing audio or video communication products during the COVID-19 nationwide public 29 health emergency [1]. With better reimbursement and loosening of HIPAA requirements by OCR, 30 telemedicine and telehealth technologies went from fringe to mainstream in a matter of weeks. The 31 learning curve during this time period has been steep and fraught with challenges as practices and 32 patients struggle to use these tools effectively. Portnoy et al.'s recent prediction that, \"the use of 33 telemedicine will be simply seen as how health care is done\" [2] has come true much faster than 34 expected. 35 While real-time (live video) telemedicine visits have helped augment struggling practices during 36 nationwide stay-at-home orders, what other telehealth options are there to supplement income and 37 provide better care for patients relegated to their homes? Telemedicine is generally defined as 38 synchronous or asynchronous, with synchronous \"real-time\" patient visits taking center stage right now. 39 Asynchronous or \"store-and-forward\" applications can also be utilized to complement a practice and 40 have the added benefit of providing care to a wider range of patients over a larger geographic area 41 without the aforementioned restrictions on state medical licensure. Electronic consultations (eConsults) 42 are delayed communications sent through a secure email or messaging service to a cloud-based 43 platform where specialists can review patient charts and other pertinent patient data including 44 diagnostic images, lab reports, or videos in preparation for a consult [3]. eConsults provide a convenient GREIWE 3 way for specialists and primary care providers (PCPs) to collaborate on difficult cases despite differences 46 in locations or time zones. While not suitable for emergency care, store-and forward technology 47 eliminates the complex process of specialty referral, especially in remote areas where local specialists 48 might not be available. There are several companies that provide these services, connecting PCPs to 49 specialists to reduce unnecessary referrals, improve care coordination, reduce costs, and enhance 50 patient care. 51 After personally becoming involved with an eConsulting service one year ago, I have gleaned meaningful 52 insights about this evolving industry. First, eConsults are primarily from practices in California (78%) and 53 initiated by registered nurses (65%) followed by medical doctors (19%), nurse practitioners (13%), and 54 physician assistants (3%). Secondly, eConsult's can be specialty specific depending on the platform used 55 ranging from simple questions about rhinitis to more complex questions about immunodeficiency and 56 often provide supporting documentation for review. Finally, and probably most importantly, the 57 reimbursement for this service is a fixed amount ranging from $35-40 per eConsult regardless of the 58 time required to answer the question(s), and although most could be completed within 10-15 minutes, 59 others could take up to 40 minutes without additional compensation. Thus, similar to the pre-COVID 19 60",

However, 84 all of the potential advantages of eConsults are predicated on proper reimbursement, otherwise, our 85 broken health care system will continue to flounder along with rising wasteful health care costs. 86The challenges of COVID-19 have forced the medical community to pivot from the standard in-person 87 visit to a telemedicine-focused structure to provide patient care. This pandemic has exposed many 88 weaknesses in our healthcare system that need to be addressed, but it has also highlighted how 89 effective and valuable telemedicine services can be used to improve these deficiencies. Telemedicine 90 and telehealth technologies have helped prevent the collapse of our healthcare system during this 91 pandemic by providing safe, accessible, cost-effective, and convenient health care. While this system is 92 still wrought with many technologic problems such as poor access by the end user to the necessary 93 GREIWE 5 software and hardware, telemedicine is an integral step in the right direction as healthcare providers 94 attempt to navigate the new world of medicine in the post-COVID-19 era. 95",
