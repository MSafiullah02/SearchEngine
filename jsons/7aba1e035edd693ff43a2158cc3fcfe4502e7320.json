When community extension is taking place, 26 as in most parts of the world, ophthalmological, otorhinolaryngology, dermatological and 27 plastic surgery might lead to an important number of infections in medical personnel. It is also 28 important to notice that higher inoculum is related to severity of influenza 1 , and this might 29 also be the case for COVID-19. An ophthalmologist described this disease in Wuhan, and the 30 first doctors in Italy and Spain with the disease, in our limited experience, were 31 ophthalmologists, dermatologists, and plastic surgeons.

This could be done by screening for clinical 46 features and testing for SARS-CoV-2. However, important information is missing to support this 47 method. We don't know the prevalence of infectious patients in the population. Best current 48 data indicates that 50% of COVID-19 positive patients are asymptomatic 3 , and mathematical 49 modelling has suggested that, for each COVID-19 fatality there may be thousands of cases in 50 the population 5 , suggesting the need be cautious. The negative predictive value of current 51 COVID-19 tests could be another limitation, as it is not well known 6 , but is likely to improve. It 52 is also possible that a negative test is not a good predictor of low infectiousness, thus not 53 avoiding the need for PPE. Testing professionals to protect patients should also be done. 54",
