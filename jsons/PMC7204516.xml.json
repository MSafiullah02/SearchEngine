The availability of multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests that detect a panel of respiratory viruses has made laboratory-based surveillance of HA-VRIs feasible and less time-consuming. In pediatric wards and hospitals, HA-VRI often mirrors community-acquired VRI in patients admitted for care. HA-VRIs represented 10% of HAIs in pediatric wards in a recent point-prevalence survey [8], whereas in another study, close to 20% of infants and toddlers admitted to a tertiary-care pediatric hospital had a virus detected in their nasopharyngeal specimen [10]. Although the overall burdens of HA-VRI and outbreaks of specific viruses were reported previously [11\u201319], benchmarks for comparison are not readily available. Our objective was to determine, compare, and assess determinants of unit-specific HA-VRI incidence rates in 2 children\u2019s hospitals.",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations that could explain the difference in HA-VRI rates between the 2 participating hospitals. First, no standardized definition for HA-VRI currently exists, and the IPAC services at each hospital used slightly different criteria. However, although the surveillance definitions differed slightly, both of them required a new onset of similar symptoms, and 1 definition (MCH) was more precise as to what was considered a respiratory symptom, which made it more operational and less subject to interpretation. Second, minimum durations of hospitalization before the onset of symptoms required to classify an infection as nosocomial were based on published incubation periods for each virus type; these durations were similar but not identical between hospitals and generally were at the lower end of the range for each virus type. These definitions were designed to be sensitive for the detection of HAIs and possible outbreaks. However, a potential exists for misclassification of some community-acquired infections as HAI. Third, the surveillance procedures for HA-VRI differed; 1 hospital was more aggressive in actively finding cases (including syndromic surveillance for which viral testing was either negative or not requested), whereas the other hospital was using a surveillance system that was laboratory based, which again potentially explains the difference in rates. This difference in case findings, however, is the Achille\u2019s heel of all surveillance programs. Fourth, the case mix of patients in both hospitals also differed; chronically ventilator-dependent patients who attended out-of-hospital daycare were accounted for in HAI surveillance at the MCH. IPAC guidelines for additional precautions and visitation policies also differed. Last, another limitation to our study was that the detection of HA-VRI that manifested after hospital discharge was incomplete, because no systematic surveillance for HA-VRI is performed after discharge. The only children with HA-VRI with symptom onset after hospital discharge who were likely to be identified were those who presented to the emergency department or were readmitted because of a VRI.",
