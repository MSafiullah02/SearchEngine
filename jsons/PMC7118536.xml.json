The first patient was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on December 12, 2019. The symptoms of patients were fever, fatigue, dry-cough and the patients gradually developed severe dyspnea. The majority of them had a good prognosis [2,3], while a mortality rate of 2.1 % has been recently reported [4]. The average incubation period of the disease was found to be 6.4 days [5]. At present, the diagnosis relies on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene sequencing of sputum, throat swab or lower respiratory tract secretion [6]. However, these methods are time-consuming and do not allow assessing the disease severity. Chest CT scanning can provide rapid screening and assess the severity. In this study, we report the CT characteristics of patients with COVID-19 of various severity to provide a more comprehensive overview of the disease, in order to help the clinical diagnosis and management.",

Seventy-three patients with proven COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 41 males and 32 females; aged 5\u201386 years, with mean age of (41.6 \u00b1 14.5) years. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in accordance with the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (fifth edition) formulated by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China [7]. The CT images and clinical data of all patients were collected. Among the 73 patients, 54 (74 %) had the travel history to or from Wuhan, 16 (22 %) had a history of close contact with the local COVID-19 patients before the illness onset, and the remaining 3 patients denied any contact or travel history. All patients were administered with anti-viral and supportive treatment, and prevention of complications based on their clinical condition.",

[13] review the CT findings of 121 symptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 in relationship to the time between symptom onset and the initial CT scan and find that the early patients (0\u20132 days) have far fewer frequency of GGO and consolidation and lower severity score of pneumonia as compared with the intermediate (3\u20135 days) and late (6\u201312 days) patients. The authors\u2019 study is of significance for recognizing imaging patterns based on infection time course. However, in many patients, the disease severity is often not consistent with the course of disease. Our study analyses the chest CT characteristics of COVID-19 based on the staging of disease severity, which likely more accurately reflects the relationship between CT features and disease severity compared with the previous study.",
