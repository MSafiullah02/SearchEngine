CD can be attributed to multifactorial etiology, including various infectious agents as well as environmental and husbandry practices (Bendali et al. 1999; Meganck et al. 2015). Among numerous infectious agents causing diarrhea in calves, bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and bovine rotavirus (BoRVA) are recognized as the most important viral pathogens (Athanassious et al. 1994). Moreover, bovine norovirus (BNoV) and bovine torovirus (BToV) are frequently associated with acute diarrhea in calves (Gebregiorgis and Tessema 2016; Mohamed et al. 2017).",

Enteric BCoV replicates in the epithelial cells of the gut and destroys the villi, thereby causing severe and often bloody diarrhea in calves; this could be life-threatening owing to the loss of electrolytes and malnutrition (Clark 1993). Disease in calves usually occurs within the first month of life. BCoV infection has a high morbidity but a low mortality. BCoV has four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), hemagglutinin esterase (HE), and spike (S) (Spaan et al. 1988). BCoV is divided into three genotype groups: groups 1, 2, and 3 depending on N protein gene. Variations in the host range and tissue tropism of coronaviruses are attributed to the spike (S) glycoprotein (Bidokhti et al. 2012).",

GI, GII, and GIV infect humans, whereas GIII and GV infect ruminants and rodents, respectively (Thomas et al. 2014). GVI is responsible for infections in canine (Vinje 2015). BNoVs are divided into two distinct genotypes: GIII.1 and GIII.2. Both subtypes have increasingly been detected in cattle with enteric or respiratory diseases worldwide (Turan et al. 2018). BNoV was initially identified in diarrheic calves aged < 7 days (Ando et al. 2000; Gunther and Otto 1987), but BNoV was subsequently found in the feces of both diarrheic and healthy animals (Di Martino et al. 2014; van der Poel et al. 2003).",

PCR products of nested-PCR assay were separated by gel electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. PCR products were purified using AccuPrep PCR Purification Kit (Bioneer, Daejeon, ROK) and subjected to direct sequencing (Macrogen, Daejeon, ROK).",

Although BCoV is more prevalent in calves aged 1\u201310 days compared with the calves of other age groups, our results demonstrated no association between BCoV infection and calf age. Several studies have reported no association between BCoV infection and CD (Bartels et al. 2010; Uhde et al. 2008). However, the present study showed that BCoV infections were more commonly identified in diarrheic feces than in normal feces, indicating that BCoV was associated with diarrhea. A phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene revealed that BCoV isolates detected in this study diverged from CD and WD isolates reported previously in the ROK and were clustered into a separate branch. Interestingly, our isolates were more closely related to the isolates from wild animals. This suggests that genetic variations exist within BCoV isolates prevalent in the ROK.

            "text": "In this study, BNoV was the most prevalent viral pathogen in pre-weaned Korean native calves. BNoV was detected in eight farms, barring one (Sangju). BNoV alone was identified in Anseong farm, which was cleaner and more spacious than the other farms (Table 2). It is speculated that norovirus is a zoonotic pathogen; thus, it is transmitted to calves through humans. According to our results, BNoV had an infection rate of \u2265 10%, except in the Gimje farm (Table 2). Our study reported a BNoV prevalence rate of 12.2%, which was higher than that reported previously in the ROK (Park et al. 2007a). A previous study reported that BNoV infection is endemic in diarrheic calves in the ROK (Park et al. 2007a), whereas our results revealed that BNoV was found regardless of diarrhea and that BNoV infection had no association with diarrhea. Consequently, we cannot make a definite conclusion that BNoV infection is a direct cause of CD. Moreover, BNoV prevalence was higher in calves aged 1\u201310 days and gradually decreased with age (Table 5). We found no correlation between BCoV and calf age. BNoV occurred as a co-infection with BCoV or BToV, but not with BoRVA. Owing to few co-infection samples, it was not possible to demonstrate that those viruses were associated with diarrhea. Based on the partial RdRp region, 50 BNoV isolates were classified into GIII.2 genotype and were divergent from the previously reported Korean isolates (Fig. 2). The results suggest that GIII.2 is the dominant genotype of BNoV circulating in the ROK, with genetic variations occurring in this strain. Further studies are warranted to investigate the pathogenicity and pathogenesis of BNoV.",

            "text": "BoRVA is the primary cause of acute diarrhea in neonatal calves (Reynolds et al. 1986; Snodgrass 1986; Uhde et al. 2008). Here, the prevalence of BoRVA was considerably higher in diarrheic feces than that in normal feces. The present study revealed that BoRVA infection was significantly associated with diarrhea. BoRVA infection was observed only in calves aged < 30 days, indicating that BoRVA causes diarrhea in young animals. Here, the prevalence of BoRVA was very low, whether the infection rate of BoRVA is originally low or whether it varies according to different groups of rotaviruses, such as group B and group C, remains unclear to date. A previous study revealed that group C rotavirus caused diarrhea in Korean native calves (Park et al. 2011). Another possibility is that vaccination for BoRVA has been well implemented in the ROK, which has caused a reduction in BoRVA infection rate among calves. This reflects the importance of vaccination. Several reports have indicated that the most prevalent genotypes of BoRVA are G6, G8, and G10 in combination with P[1], P[5], P[7], and P[11], with G6P[5] being the most prevalent in cattle among several countries (Alfieri et al. 2004; Badaracco et al. 2013; Collins et al. 2014; Fukai et al. 2004; Park et al. 2011). All our isolates detected in this study were assigned to G6P[5]. Moreover, to our knowledge, the P[5]-III and P[5]- VIIIlineages have been identified for the first time in the present study, and the P[5]-VIII lineage is dominant in pre-weaned Korean native calves. Molecular characterization of RVA strains prevalent among animals is of great importance in terms of both animal and public health. Although the prevalence of BoRVA was low in pre-weaned calves, BoRVA should be continuously surveyed to determine BoRVA genotypes circulating in Korean native calves because of interspecies transmission and reassortment events.",

Our results revealed that the prevalence of BToV was 2.2%, which was slightly lower than that previously reported in the ROK (Park et al. 2008). This could be attributed to the different sample collection regions and the different target genes used for detecting BToV as well as calf age. BToV infection was high in Mungyeong farm compared with the other farms. The pathogens detected varied according to the farms from which samples were collected (Table 2), likely owing to the difference in hygiene levels and management systems in farms. BToV alone acts as a primary enteric pathogen in calves aged < 30 days (Aita et al. 2012). However, our result showed that BToV infection was more prevalent in calves aged \u2264 30 days, but this prevalence was not statistically significant (P = 0.137) and was also not associated with diarrhea (P = 0.662). Our findings were inconsistent with those of a previous study (Aita et al. 2012). Here, BToV was found only in co-infections with BCoV or BNoV (Table 4), and these co-infections did not cause diarrhea. To date, there is little available information regarding BToV infection causing diarrhea in the ROK. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that our isolates were more closely related to Japanese strains than to the Breda 1 strain (Fig. 4). Although BToV infection has been reported in the ROK, owing to differences in the target gene, we could not reveal genetic diversity between the isolates identified in this study and the previously reported Korean isolates. Further studies involving large-scale epidemiologic investigation of several genes are warranted to identify the prevalence of BToV and its association with diarrhea.",
