The outbreak of chikungunya has re-emerged in various continents including Asiaand America and has become a major threat to the human population. The infection caused by the CHIKV results in a broad range of clinical symptoms starts from fever and body aches to joint pains which may lead to polyarthralgia which could persist from days to months. Unfortunately, there is no direct treatments or vaccinations available for this severe infection.",

This massive outbreak that occurred in India in the year of 2016, affecting millions of people. The positive rate of the CHIKV virus was approximately 70% among them 97% of patients were suffering from severe joint pains and restriction in movements (Kaur et al. 2017). The burden of chikungunya infection increases day by day, the reason behind that is, the vector for CHIKV and dengue are similar in some ways, which leads to confusion in the treatment plans. Most of dengue negative patients were analyzed under the chikungunya infection test and were found chikungunya positive (Dutta et al. 2017). Another reason for the increasing burden of this infection load is the unavailability of the treatment or a proper vaccination. Even though various scientific groups are working independently in order to design a vaccine for this infectious disease, but still there isn't any treatment or vaccination available (Powers 2017).",

The two chains of TAP protein TAP1 and TAP2 form a cavity for the movement of the peptide molecule. The TAP protein bound at the RER membrane and having a cytosolic domain. Each chain of TAP protein contains an ATP binding site and the transportation of small peptide is mediated by the hydrolysis of ATP molecule into ADP + Pi.

The identified epitopes which were nanomeric in size and having IC50 value less than 50 and the conservancy value in the range of 88\u2013100%were selected for further analysis.

This top-down approach of immunoinformatics (Fig. 1) helped in edging a large amount of epitope to the promiscuous T cell epitope. Epitopes are known to be promiscuous if they bind with the HLA alleles of HLA supertypes.

Total of five supertypes of HLA alleles was selected and a total of 9 HLA allele was used for the prediction of the epitopes. The artificial neural network (ANN) approach was of the IEDB tool and was used for the prediction of epitopes based on the IC50 value. The small IC50 value refers to the good binders and those were selected from the predicted epitopes. The predicted epitopes who had IC50 values less than or equal to 50 nM (Nano Molar) were again examined for their conservancy in the proteome of the chikungunya virus. A total of 11 protein sequences was used to check the conservancy of each epitope. Those epitopes found their conservancy in the range of 88\u2013100 were used. The 71TVIPNTVGV79145KVFTGVYPE153(Structural Protein) is the part of envelope glycoprotein and 395STVPVAPPR40318CVVNAANPR26 (Non-Structural protein) are the part of nsP3 which are the macrodomain of the non-structural protein. All these epitopes were found conservancy score is 100%. The predicted epitopes were further analyzed for their TAP binding activity. The TAPPred tool was used for finding that predicted epitopes are High Binder, Intermediate binder or Non-Binder. It has been identified that the above-specified epitopes were falling in the category of intermediate binder to High binder with a score value of 4.238 nM, 3.841 nM, 3.662 nM, & 4.720 nM respectively. Then again further the identified epitopes were examined whether the predicted epitopes share the part with B cell epitope or not by using the BCPred tool. It was found that the epitopes shared the part with B cell epitopes (Tables 1, 2).",

The molecular dynamics and simulation studies were performed using the NAMD-VMD tool for all the predicted six epitopes-HLA complexes using the topology and structural files of the VMD tool. The MD simulation was run for 100,000-time steps and the minimization of energy was run for the 1000 steps by using the default parameters of the program. The simulation was run for the time step of 1 Fs (Femtosecond). After successfully running the algorithm the md.out and md.dcd files were used for the analysis of the MD simulation result. There were two graphs were plotted between the RMSD and Time (PS) and Energy and Timestep (TS). For building both the graph VMD tool was used. The protein.psf file was loaded first and then the protein_md.dcd file was uploaded for further analysis. The NAMD plot tool of VMD was used to plot the Energy vs Time step graph and the RMSD trajectory tool was used to plot the RMSD vs Time graph. In the Energy vs TS graph protein_wb_md.out file of MD simulation was used as a Y-axis and time steps kept on the X-axis. In the RMSD vs Time graph protein_wb.psf and protein_wb_md.dcd files were used. The RMSD trajectory tool first performs the alignment and then plot the RMSD vs Time graph using the time slot 0.0\u20131.0. Among the six identified epitopes HLA complexesepitopes i.e. 145KVFTGVYPE153&395STVPVAPPR403 (1 from structural & 1 from Non-structural protein) were found stable in the MD simulation analysis.",

This research work started with the prediction of the nanomeric T cell epitopes by using the immune epitope database. The ANN (Artificial Neural Network) algorithm of the IEDB database was used. Epitopes with IC50 values below 50 nM were selected. Only two of the T cell epitopes among all identified epitopes were found highly conserved, they also share the part with the B cell linear epitope and they show good binding energy with the cTAP1 and HLA class I allele. The predicted epitopes show the good binding with the TAP molecule which infers the movement of the peptides through the lumen of RER (Rough endoplasmic reticulum) with help of TAP protein to bind with the MHC class I allele. To understand the structural analysis, the modeled epitopes were docked with cTAP1 protein and HLA class I alleles using the AutoDock 4.2. In this study author had performed docking studies with the downloaded structure of HLA-A*02:06 (PDB ID:3OXR) from PDB database and the obtained energy value are not good in comparison to the modelled structure. The obtained binding energy with the PDB structure was 3.24 kcal/mol while the obtained binding energy with the modelled structure was 4.53 kcal/mol. Due to good binding energy the modelled structure was preferred over the PDB structure. The scoring function (Rizvi et al. 2013) of the AutoDock 4.2 makes it more reliable for studying the molecular behavior and its interaction with the ligand molecule and it found that KVFTGVYPE and STVPVAPPR were highly conserved.",

The identified epitopes are nanomeric in their size and have the capacity to become the most promiscuous vaccine candidate for chikungunya. As reported previously that structural and non-structural proteins help in designing the peptide-based vaccine for Dengue and Hepatitis (Kaushik et al. 2014; Henriques et al. 2013). Researchhad been documented, supports the immunoinformatics approach for predicting the best and most promiscuous epitopes or antigenic determinant for the purpose of designing vaccine candidate in-silico to overcome the burden of viral infections (Sharma et al. 2016). Though in-silico studies are playing major role in the recent days\u2019 research. The cost effectiveness and rapidity in obtaining the result make in-silico studies an important asset in the today\u2019s research. Even though these advantages are there with the in-silico studies, there are certain limitations. The result obtained from the in-silico studies could not be directly employed in the real world, the obtained results must be tested in the laboratory before implementing to the real world. Another disadvantage of in-silico studies is that the result is based on the tools/methods used, so there is possibility that the obtained result might get vary and produced ambiguity among the obtained results. The reliability of the tools is the main concern in the field of in-silico studies, if tools are not statistically tested, the obtained result could not be believed to be reliable. So, in in-silico studies selection of tools with the reliable algorithm is very much important. Similarly, this study identified the promiscuous T cell epitopes which could be analyzed and tested in the laboratory as vaccine candidates for designing the vaccine for chikungunya.",
