While schizophrenia has clear genetic underpinnings, currently known genes explain only a portion of disease risk.1,2 In addition to genetic factors, environmental exposures have been identified as increasing risk for the disease. Environmental factors associated with increased risk of schizophrenia include winter-spring birth, urban birth, maternal preeclampsia, and perinatal and postnatal infections.3\u20136 The potential role of infections in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia is supported by the associations between schizophrenia risk and genes which encode HLA and other factors which control the immune response to infectious agents.1,7",

EBV is a lymphotropic virus that produces latent infections with immunomodulatory effects.8,9 Primary infection with EBV is often associated with self-limited fever and adenopathy. Following acute infection, the virus persists in host B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, and epithelial cells; asymptomatic salivary viral shedding leads to onward transmission.10 EBV can establish latency in many body sites including the brain where reactivation can be associated with encephalitis11 and brain-specific immune responses.12 The immune response to EBV infection can be monitored by the measurement of levels of antibody directed at antigens derived from virions as well as specific EBV proteins. Commonly measured anti-EBV antibodies include: anti-early antigen (EA) that arises early in the course of infection and decreases after 3\u20136 months; viral capsid antibody (VCA) that also arises early in infection but persists for extended periods of time; anti-EB nuclear antigen (EBV NA or EBNA) that does not arise until late in infection but does persist for extended periods of time13,14 (supplementary figure 4). The response to additional EBV proteins can be measured by western blotting techniques15 to further define the immune response to infection.",

The differences were independent of demographic variables that are known to affect EBV exposure such as age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status as measured by maternal education. We also measured antibodies to specific viral proteins. These studies indicated that the individuals with schizophrenia had an aberrant immune response to EBV in that there were elevated levels of antibodies to EBV VCA but not to EBNA-1. It is likely that most of the participants in our study have undergone primary EBV infection at some time in the past as evidenced by the presence of low levels of antibody to EBV early antigen (EA). Generally, individuals with past infections to EBV have increased levels of IgG class antibodies to both VCA and EBNA-1 antigens.13 The levels of EBV antibodies in the study populations are relatively stable over extended periods of time since the levels did not change significantly in the individuals for whom follow-up samples were available. This finding suggests that the aberrant immune response is unlikely to be related to timing of sampling but is relatively stable within an individual over time; additional longitudinal studies should be done to assess the stability of the markers over time. Antibodies to other herpesviruses including HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV, VZV, and HHV-6 were not significantly increased in the same population of individuals with schizophrenia.

In terms of the virus, a differential response to infection might be related to variation in the timing of primary EBV exposure, the genomic composition and pathogenicity of the infecting EBV, and possible re-exposure to differing strains of EBV.38 Virological analysis of samples obtained from individuals in prospective studies will be required to address these possibilities. An altered immune response to EBV infection could also be based on host factors such as genetics or other environmental factors. In terms of genetic factors, we found an additive effect of increased EBV antibodies and increased genetic risk with a combined odds ratio of 8.86 for individuals with values \u226575th percentile of both measures. However, there was no statistically significant association interaction between the levels of EBV virion antibodies and the polygenic risk scores suggesting that the risks associated with genetic susceptibility and increased levels of EBV virion antibodies are independent. However larger sample sizes might be employed to detect low levels of interaction. Furthermore, additional genetic studies are required to define the genetic contribution to the aberrant response to EBV infection found in individuals with schizophrenia. The possibility use of combinations of immune and genetic markers for the diagnosis and management of schizophrenia is an important area for future study.

            "text": "In terms of other environmental factors, it is of note that we found an association between levels of antibodies to EBV virion proteins and cigarette smoking in individuals with schizophrenia. An interaction between EBV exposure and cigarette smoking has also been noted in other EBV-associated disorders such as multiple sclerosis, possibly based on the many immunomodulatory effects of cigarette smoking.39 As for the above factors, the timing of the interaction between cigarette smoking and EBV exposure in terms of risk for schizophrenia should be addressed in prospective studies. The possible effects of lymphotropic viruses such as EBV and other environmental factors which can affect B-cell activity on the immunopathology of schizophrenia should be the subject of future investigations.",

One potential scenario is that individuals with aberrant EBV immune responses underwent previous replication of EBV within the central nervous system. This possibility is consistent with reports of psychosis in individuals undergoing EBV encephalitis and the finding of increased levels of EBV VCA antibodies in the CSF of some individuals with psychiatric disorders.40\u201345 It is also possible that psychiatric symptoms are related to neuro-inflammatory effects on the brain including alterations in neurotransmitter receptor interactions, as has been found in a range of autoimmune disorders which affect the brain.46",

These autoimmune anti-glutamate receptor antibodies can bind neurons in few brain regions, activate glutamate receptors, decrease glutamate receptor\u2019s expression, impair glutamate-induced signaling and function, activate blood brain barrier endothelial cells, kill neurons, damage the brain, induce behavioral/psychiatric/cognitive abnormalities and ataxia in animal models, and can be removed or silenced in some patients by immunotherapy",
