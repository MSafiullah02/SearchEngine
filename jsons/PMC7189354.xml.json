Viscusi et al. (1991) developed a method to measure the value of morbidity risk reductions which has two advantages to address catastrophic events. First, catastrophic risks tend to involve small absolute probabilities, which respondents find difficult to process. This method lets them focus on more readily processed comparisons such as whether preventing 100 deaths from a terrorist attack is valued more highly than preventing 100 traffic deaths. Second, \u201cthe comparisons involve a single dimension of choice\u2014fatalities\u2014so that respondents can focus on how fatalities are viewed without dealing with the less readily commensurable trade-off between money and fatality risks. Eliminating money as an attribute of choice also eliminates the task of establishing a credible payment mechanism for the policy\u201d (Viscusi 2009).",

We investigated the geographic, socioeconomic, and demographic factors affecting the perceived risk of each catastrophic event as shown in Table 1. Our results illustrated that on average, retired respondents, who might perceive themselves as being more vulnerable to pandemic risks, favor policies that reduce pandemic risk over policies that reduce environmental disaster risk or terrorism risk. Respondents in states on the Mexico border and those of Asian descent favored policies that reduce the risk of environmental disasters rather than pandemics. Respondents located on the west coast and are physically removed from the 9/11 attack and the Boston Marathon bombing favored policies that reduce pandemic risk over policies that reduce terrorism risk, while respondents with income greater than $150,000 and living on the East Coast preferred policies that reduce terrorist attack risk over pandemic risk. Proximity to a catastrophic event affects value of policies to prevent that event from occurring. Further, groups who may feel more vulnerable to a particular catastrophic event will value lives saved in that scenario greater. Both patterns of results lead us to believe that respondents will place higher value on lives saved the less abstract and more realistic the catastrophic event.",

People demand more lives for environmental disasters even though that while people died in the explosion in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, no person died in the environmental disaster following the accident. In the domestic example given to respondents (Deepwater Horizon oil spill), no human lives were lost. Many examples exist of foreign environmental disasters (Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, Chernobyl disaster) in which several thousand people died that respondents could be referencing. Respondents may also be confusing environmental disasters (preventable) with natural disasters (non-preventable), such as Hurricane Katrina.",

Our estimates illustrate that respondents were undervaluing the risk of pandemic death, which in turn is contributing to our current lack of preparedness. We appreciate that the focus of the terrorism and environmental disaster risks refer to only the US events, while the pandemic risks include the USA and several other countries, which implies that people might have focused on the US-only risks given they preferred investing in the US only. While acknowledging this point could be a possibility, we think it is less likely that respondents kept their preferences flat because they were thinking of foreign lives. Our survey communicated that there were both US risks and foreign risks to the respondents. If the respondents think that terrorism poses a risk to them and Ebola only poses risks outside the country, then the US lives would be more highly valued since their personal valuations of risk would enter.",

Based on Bayesian learning models in which people update probabilities based on information they acquire, and the availability heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman 1981), we would expect higher valuations for avoiding pandemic risks.

Respondents with income greater than $150,000 and living on the east coast were now indifferent between policies, but those respondents affiliated with the Republican Party and male respondents now prefer policies that reduce terrorist attack risk over pandemic risk.

When applying the VSL method, our respondents valued a life saved in a more certain traffic accident more than twice as much as a life saved in an uncertain pandemic outbreak.

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that the US was as unprepared as experts feared, given the responses to the Ebola scare in 2014 (The Washington Post Editorial 2016). The average US citizen in our survey was more likely to pay more to reduce terrorism risks and environmental risks than pandemic risks both before and after the substantial media coverage for Ebola. This lack of attention to pandemic threats is especially disturbing given that the current COVID-19 and any potential future pandemics that may also have very high transmission rates, including transmission before individuals become symptomatic. The present COVID-19 pandemic drives home the importance of these behavioral results and the necessity of taking stronger preventive measures than the public might consider necessary.
