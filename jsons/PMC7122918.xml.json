            "text": "Aliens fill us with dread and yet they exert an inescapable attraction on us. We shun them, we deny that they exist, but we can\u2019t get away from them\u2014and no wonder: we don\u2019t necessarily recognize them when they\u2019re standing right in front of us. Aliens can assume familiar forms; they can look like members of our own family or our friends. They are familiar strangers. Or they can usurp humans like parasites, turning them into zombies. No one is immune. The distinction between what is out there\u2014sometimes, as in the case of extraterrestrials, way out there\u2014and what is within us begins to disappear.Aliens are a kind of social dream. Societies dream just like individuals do. This collective dreamlike experience, which arises as result of an evolving dynamic between the individuals and their culture, is constantly being transformed, sometimes incrementally, sometimes in quantum leaps. The social dream emerges from aggregate social experience just as our own dreams are based to one degree or another on our life experience. That experience\u2014societal and individual\u2014is the raw material of the dream. And although the meaning and purpose of dreams are a perpetual subject of dispute and speculation, there is no doubt that dreams are frequently characterized by tension. A good case can be made that dreams are an attempt to work out conflict. What holds for individual dreams is true of the social dream. And there is probably no better vehicle for expressing our social dreams and for revealing the conflicts that society is grappling with, than the movies. By bringing these conflicts to light, moviemakers, whether they are conscious of it or not, are trying to explain the sources of tension and showing us a possible way out of our dilemma. Unlike books, films are a collective medium that calls on creative collaboration involving the director, the screenwriters the actors and ultimately the audience. A very interesting dynamic arises from this collaboration; what the screenwriter imagines when he is putting words down on paper is not the same as what the director imagines while she\u2019s shooting the film or what the actors imagine while they\u2019re performing. However, without the viewer\u2019s imagination, the film would be dead on arrival. This dynamic isn\u2019t limited to any particular place or time; if the film is successful and has something to say then the audiences of generations to come will be invited to become collaborators, too. Given this dynamic, films have a unique ability to capture the zeitgeist (the cultural ethos and values of a society) and represent a social dream. The individual collaborators may not be aware they are doing this (often they are not) and the results may surprise all the participants. That is why the cinematic portrayals of aliens can tell us so much about what\u2019s going on in human minds. But it works the other way around as well just as movies can reflect social distress (thanks to this often unconscious collaboration between filmmakers, writers, actors and audiences). They also have the capacity\u2014and the power\u2014to exacerbate social distress. Movies have been equated with dreams, since they employ the language of dreams to powerful effect. But movies can also provoke nightmares, too, and those nightmares don\u2019t necessarily end upon waking. Alternatively, they may just help to hypnotize us and keep us in the dark.\n",

            "text": "So if movies reveal a social dream, what can we say about social dreams in which aliens play a dominant role? What kinds of conflicts can potentially be resolved by a movie about aliens both benign (as in the 1982 \u201cET\u201d film) or malevolent (as in the \u201cAlien\u201d series) The answer is\u2026it depends. During the Cold War, social dreams were haunted by the specter of nuclear annihilation. If humans were perceived as incapable of settling disputes on their own we would require intervention by another life form with higher intelligence, capable of cleaning up the mess we\u2019ve made. There is no better example than \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d (1951) in which the alien Klatu (Michael Ronnie) shuts down all power for half an hour to demonstrate the consequences if humans don\u2019t reform their ways. Klatu is an obvious messiah figure; he is killed and then resuscitated by his robot Gort. (The robot is programmed to destroy the world if it doesn\u2019t hear the magic words uttered by the character played by Patricia Neal\u2014\u201cKlatu barrada nikto.\u201d) \u201cJoin us and live in peace,\u201d As he prepares to return home Klatu warns humankind to change \u201cor pursue your present course and face obliteration.\u201d",

Aliens can be clones (like those in \u201cBlade Runner\u201d) or other outsiders like Frankenstein, Dracula, the werewolf, and the zombie. These beings meet the definition insofar as they occupy a state that isn\u2019t human but that isn\u2019t entirely not human, either (like another species); they aren\u2019t alive exactly but they aren\u2019t dead (or at least they aren\u2019t content to stay safely in the grave and decompose.) And while the majority of movies about aliens fall into a category we could loosely term \u201cscience fiction\u201d they tend to be hybrids\u2014a mixture of genres. Some movies, such as the Alien series, are essentially horror movies set in outer space. Others like \u201cE. T.\u201d are really fantasies, fairy tales in which the \u2018monster\u2019 may be misunderstood due to physical appearance and suspect origins. Still others like \u201cMen in Black\u201d (1997), notwithstanding its comic tone, are really mysteries. The Men in Black are purportedly CIA or FBI agents policing undercover aliens. According to conspiracy theorists, such creatures may produce official-looking IDs which ultimately turn out to be fake or belong to people who are deceased.",

That is because alien life forms, assuming they exist somewhere in the cosmos, remain as much of a subject of speculation as ever in spite of all our efforts to detect their presence. Aliens hold the answer to the gnawing question that has preyed upon our minds since homo sapiens first emerged in the African savannah: are we alone in the universe?

            "text": "Aliens have a long and storied history, a history that runs parallel to and is rooted in our own. Aliens, after all, need a species to alienate or be alienated from. Aliens frequently enjoy a condition that humans can only aspire to\u2014namely immortality. In these two first great civilizations of the ancient world, Egypt and China, the people believed in immortality and went to extraordinary lengths to try to achieve it. We have only to think of the pyramids or the necropolis of Qin in Xian, built by the first emperor of China. The direction that these two civilizations took to reach their goals was quite different\u2014both literally and symbolically. Egypt took to the skies, or heavens, while China, went in the opposite direction\u2014underground\u2014in order to create their future home of immortality. (Qin\u2019s palace, guarded by a terracotta army and booby-trapped with arrows that could be triggered by intruders, still hasn\u2019t been completely excavated.) Both of these civilizations believed, and acted upon, their prime beliefs that you can take it with you! For the ancient Egyptians and Chinese these monuments, even if they were only intended for princes, potentates, and the highborn represented the ultimate means of coping with the perennial fear of death as well as serving a related purpose: namely, helping those peoples define the meaning of life. These are opposite sides of the same coin, as it were. Death is alien to life and life is alien to death. To the ancient Egyptians, the objective was to join or commune with the star gods or to travel, as it were, back to where it all began, to their origins. In their view, immortality amounted to a state of transcendence to an alien form of life but one that was both familiar and safe. In other words, the aliens out there turn out to be the aliens in us, too, that is, they reside inside our own human consciousness. Although these immortality-obsessed civilizations reached their pinnacle around 2000 BC, they are only one example of an age-old human coping mechanism in the face of mortality. It may be argued that in the current age we do this through movies.",

            "text": "From time immemorial we have been preoccupied with where we came from as a species, and where and when we die. That leaves us with the interval between the two extremes. Sir Francis Crick, who with James Watson won the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on DNA, was partial to the idea that life might have first evolved from organisms that came from outer space. We are all composed of so-called genetic junk, whose purpose is still unknown. Is this evidence of our extraterrestrial beginnings? Regardless of the answer, we must side with Shakespeare when he wrote, \u201cThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.\u201d Shall we look back to our future, or look ahead to our past? Metaphorically speaking, the past is in some measure the present and is part of the past; but tomorrow is forever. All of this is what the contemporary myths in films about the aliens tell us. Or put another way: Are the gods of the human race within us or outside of us, or is it necessary to have a concept of god at all? The great medieval philosopher Meister Eckhart said, \u201cThe more God is in all things, the more he is outside them\u201d although he was careful to add: \u201cGod is within more than without.\u201d The equation of gods and aliens isn\u2019t simply a bit of rhetorical sleight of hand. Sometimes in movies, aliens behave more like the capricious gods of ancient Greece. In \u201cThe 27th Day\u201d (1957), for example, aliens plan to wipe out humanity but decide to let their victims do their work for them by giving five people capsules capable of destroying a continent, then withdraw from the scene to watch the ensuing disaster from afar. This state of affairs recalls Pogo\u2019s famous saying that we have met the enemy and he is us.",

            "text": "Our fascination with aliens may, to a large degree, derive from our own alienation. As the distinguished psychologist George Miller observed in his inaugural address to the American Psychological Association in the 1960\u2019s \u201cPeople are growing increasingly alienated from a society in which a few wise men behind closed doors decide what is good for everyone\u2026. Even those most blessed by economic rewards are asking for something more satisfying to fill their lives\u2026Anyone who reads the newspapers must realize that vast social changes are in the making, that they must occur if civilized society is to survive.\u201d What filmmakers are doing\u2014although they are seldom conscious of it\u2014is playing upon the awe and fear that these \u201cfew wise men behind closed doors\u201d evoke, transforming them by the magic of cinema into the alien beings who exercise powers that are denied ordinary human beings. \u201cVested interests will oppose these changes, of course,\u201d Miller goes on, \u201cbut as someone once said, vested interests, however, powerful, cannot withstand the gradual encroachment of new ideas.\u201d Almost invariably, the intervention of aliens in our world upends the established order (how could it not?) Even when we defeat the aliens and send them packing (if we haven\u2019t obliterated them first) things have changed irrevocably. Just think of what will happen when scientists announce that they have discovered life on another planet, as they probably will someday; even if that life form is microbial, it will inevitably compel us to readjust our conception of the cosmos and our place within it. In that sense, films in which aliens play a role allow us to stage dress rehearsals in our minds for the possibility that one day aliens will walk among us, if they aren\u2019t already.",

His theories may be far fetched, but he managed to tap into a general feeling that superior beings like Klatu may have visited Earth more than once in the past and set things in motion (an idea that Kubrick also exploits in his 1968 classic \u201c2001\u201d). The \u201cStargate\u201d franchise (launched by MGM in 1994) was based on the premise that aliens infiltrated the Earth many years ago through a wormhole created by a ring-shaped alien device (the Stargate of the title) and have been walking among us for years. And we all know what happened when aliens attacked us in H. G. Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d (made into a film in 1953 and again in 2004) where the alien invasion culminates in a takeover of our planet, proving that if they could push the start button aliens also have the capacity to press the stop button as well.",

The machine city in \u201cMetropolis\u201d (1926), for example, could as well have been operated by aliens as by subjugated proles; indeed, that is the point: for the ruling class the slave laborers are aliens. Significantly, \u201cMetropolis\u201d features a female robot, carrying on a tradition that began with Joseph Melies who pioneered the use of robots in film \u201cThe Clown and the Automaton, 1987.\u201d Robots and androids are simply aliens in another guise, the main difference being that humans are responsible for their creation. However, in almost every film in which these artificial creations occur they tend to become autonomous, blurring the boundary between human and machine. HAL, the malevolent supercomputer in \u201c2001,\u201d still epitomizes the threat of technology run amok. Worse: doubt is cast as to whether it hasn\u2019t become a sentient being in its own right when, upon being dismantled, it complains that it can \u201cfeel\u201d the destruction it is undergoing. At this point HAL sings the song, \u2018Daisy, Daisy, Give Me Your Answer True,\u2019 which in an inside reference turns out to be the song used in a test for the Voice-Coder, a pioneering voice replication device created at Bell Labs. The song was also used in a nightmarish fashion in the 1954 trilogy directed by Orson Welles called \u201cThree Faces of Murder.\u201d It should also be noted that when the villain is finally revealed at the conclusion of \u201cThe President\u2019s Analyst\u201d (1967) it turns out to be an android at Bell Labs, which for many years was the premier technological research lab in the country. That the President of the United States would require an analyst wasn\u2019t some farfetched notion, either. Kenneth Clarke, in an inaugural address to the American Psychological Association proposed that an elite group of enlightened psychiatrists, mental health specialists, and neuropharmacologists should assume the administration of a program of \u201cdirect psychotechnological intervention\u201d for political leaders to \u201cassure their positive use of power and reduce or block the possibility of their using it destructively.\u201d It is unlikely that even if such a utopian project were implemented the proposed beneficiaries would be inclined to undertake a \u201ctype of internally imposed disarmament.\u201d",

            "text": "Understandably, we begin to think of our minds as if they are computers (when, in fact, they are infinitely more complicated than even the most sophisticated computers). But from that perspective, we feel that it\u2019s only a matter of time before the computers we build today will eventually create other computers with the power to take us over. (Computers are already capable of innovation that allows them to create smarter computers without human intervention.) As we surrender more and more of our lives to technology we become ever more unsettled about the forces we are unleashing. We feel that we are relinquishing control. In other words, we feel alienated from our own inventions\u2014worse, we feel that we are becoming machines. \u201cClosely related to this emphasis on control,\u201d George Miller writes in his American Psychologist essay, \u201cis the frequently repeated claim that living organisms are nothing but machines. A scientist recognizes, of course, that this claim says far more about our rapidly evolving conception of machines than it says about living organisms, but this interpretation is usually lost when the message reaches public ears. If the assumption that behavior control is feasible becomes and accepted concept, it could have unfortunate consequences, particularly if it is coupled with an assumption that control should be exercised by an industrial or bureaucratic elite\u201d Miller (1969). Sometimes this \u2018elite\u2019 can be a single individual. That is the case in another famous film from Weimer Germany featuring the \u201cmasterful hypnotizer\u201d\u2014\u201cDr. Caligari.\u201d As the noted critic Siegfried Kracauer puts it in his introduction to the script: \u201cCaligari is a very specific premonition in the sense that he uses hypnotic power to force his will upon his tool\u2014a technique foreshadowing, in content and purpose, that manipulation of the soul which Hitler was the first to practice on a gigantic scale. Although, at the time of Caligari (1920), the motif of the masterful hypnotizer was not unknown on the screen\u2026.nothing in their environment invited the two authors (Janowitz and Mayer who wrote the screenplay) to feature it. They must have been driven by one of those dark impulses, which, stemming from the slowly moving foundations of a people\u2019s life, sometimes engender true visions.\u201d (Janowitz and Mayer 1972) Caligari, like the aliens, reflects the unconscious fears and longings of society, but he also foreshadows events that these fears and longings may bring into play. \u201cWhether intentionally or not, Caligari exposes the soul wavering between tyranny and chaos, and facing a desperate situation: any escape from tyranny seems to throw it into a state of utter confusion. Quite logically, the film spreads an all-pervading atmosphere of horror. Like the Nazi world, that of Caligari overflows with sinister portents, acts of terror and outbursts of panic. The equation of horror and hopelessness comes to a climax in the final episode, which pretends to re-establish normal life\u201d (Janowitz and Mayer 1972).",

It wasn\u2019t until 1953 that aliens made their screen debut in color\u2014unsurprisingly it was green.

In \u201cThe Thing\u201d (1951), a spacecraft is discovered buried under the ice in the Arctic. By thawing out the dead pilot, scientists inadvertently unleash a blood-sucking alien on the world. A similar theme is echoed in \u201cThe Quatermass Experiment\u201d (1955). The protagonist (Richard Wordsworth) is the sole survivor of a rocket contaminated by a space organism; once he becomes infected he turns into a grotesque version of King Midas, only instead of gold, he absorbs life from whatever he touches\u2014animal, vegetable, or human, so that he finally turns into a hideous monster who meets its unlikely demise by electrocution in Westminster Abby. These cautionary tales seem to be inspired, however, indirectly, by the myth of Pandora\u2019s Box. The filmmakers were surely aware that by splitting the atom scientists had popped open the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box and that the radiation from the atomic explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki had produced more than a few human monsters, not all of them were the victims on the ground.",

In some cases a disguise is essential if the alien is to accomplish its purpose on Earth. That is certainly the case of Superman. Like many messiahs in religion and mythology, Superman has his weakness (kryptonite); concealing his alien origins, he conceals himself in the guise of a human, Clarke Kent. Superman, who began life in the 1930s in comic books before taking a star turn in any number of films and a TV series, exemplifies the alien as savior. Superman is an alien archetype that may be referred to as a perennial or a recurrent social dream. That is to say, he represents a kind of timeless myth that resonates in whatever period or place he alights. (His sinister counterparts in \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d are also perennials.) Perennials are to be distinguished from the aliens whose portrayals differ from one period to another because of changing political, cultural, or economic conditions. These aliens are products of the zeitgeist. The zeitgeist reflects generational paradigm drift rather than a shift; trends generally overlap and change incrementally. Arguably, Superman is the most powerful representative of a social dream in this context insofar as he reflects a particularly American need and longing for a savior, whether it\u2019s religious or political or comes from outer space. The enduring appeal of Superman can also be seen in the way he\u2019s portrayed from one generation to another and from one medium to another spanning comic books, movies, and television. In one of his latest incarnations the man of steel was depicted in his formative years in the TV series \u201cSmallville,\u201d a successful effort to make a perennial figure appealing to a younger generation.",

            "text": "Many people firmly believe that aliens are out there watching us\u2014aliens who are looking out for us and aliens who may not have our best interests at heart. For some the idea of benevolent aliens is akin to a religious belief system wherein an omnipotent god is taking care of things. Films have reflected this viewpoint. Stephen Spielberg\u2019s 1976 \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d is illustrative. As the Bible reminds us, \u201cmany are called but few are chosen.\u201d In this instance the \u2018chosen\u2019 one is an electric lineman named Roy who after being lured to the landing site of dozens of UFOs is welcomed on board the mothership and invited to accompany the aliens back into space. Musical sounds emitted by the spacecraft can even be seen as \u201cThe Bells of Saint Mary\u2019s\u201d calling you to church except that an alien five-toned signal takes the place of the bells. Although the nature and motivation of aliens can change with the zeitgeist the religious element persists from one generation to the next. We can even think of angels as a species of aliens. Not so many years ago angels enjoyed a kind of resurgence; rather than counting the number of them on the head of a pin it was possible to count the number of books about them in your local bookstore. (The totals might not have been too different.) Of course, angels have their counterpart in demons; the former come from above (the ancient Egyptian model) while the former emerge from below (the Chinese). That a religious association frequently attaches itself to aliens is perfectly understandable; it\u2019s human nature that\u2019s driving it. The history of human beings is characterized by a need to believe in something and for many people aliens are as good as gods or alternatively, identical to them as von Daniken postulated. As Kenneth Clarke observes in an essay entitled The Pathos of Power: A Psychological Perspective, man created God for \u201cpurpose and substance,\u201d and it is for this reason that man cannot allow God to die. \u201cIf God were to die, human beings would have to die psychologically, even though alive as organisms.\u201d God, Clarke declares, also serves as \u201ca protection against the fragility of the human ego, which led to such compensatory protective agents as \u201cdemigods, the directly observable gods\u201d as well as \u201cmagicians, medicine men, priests, bishops, kings, generals, father figures, movie stars,\u201d which he maintains, all \u201cserve similar if not identical divine functions.\u201d These \u201cpersonifications of power\u201d are given virtues and powers beyond those found in ordinary men.\u201d By identifying with them and their projected power, \u201cthe average man can obscure his weaknesses and affirm his ego\u201d (Clarke, X). But in our secular age we have imbued extraterrestrials with many of these same superhuman attributes. Aliens then can, at least on screen, assume the same privileges and shamanistic role as those medicine men, bishops, kings, and gods. The power they can project is limited only by our imaginations.",

So the prospect of nuclear catastrophe has ebbed while that of environmental calamity has grown. Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring, published in 1962, focused attention on this problem, specifically regarding the negative effect of pesticides. Although the nature of the threat to the environment has changed\u2014from the perils of DDT and to the perils of climate change\u2014the gnawing sense that the world is deteriorating has only grown. Not surprisingly, aliens have a part to play in the degradation of the environment. It turns out that aliens do not always have to come from outer space. In the 1960 low-budget \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors\u201d (which enjoyed a second life in a cinematic musical version released in 1986) the alien takes the form of a malevolent plant. The film begins with an ominous prologue delivered by Shirley Jones: \u201cOn the twenty-third day of the month of September, in an early year of a decade not too long before our own, the human race suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence. And this terrifying enemy surfaced, as such enemies often do, in the seemingly most innocent and unlikely of places\u2026\u201d The improbable hero Seymour Krelborn works as an assistant in a florist shop. Among his plants is one that resembles a Venus flytrap, which he names Audrey II in honor of a girl he has a crush on. But instead of being content with water and plant food, Audrey II has a voracious appetite for human blood, which it satisfies with increasing frequency throughout the course of the movie. \u201cLittle Shop\u201d was by no means the first film to emphasize the alien nature of plants. In \u201cThe Day of the Triffids\u201d (1963), a meteor storm blinds the human population and endows plants with humanlike intelligence, allowing them to infest London.",

By the late 1970 s, an era of increasing eradication of infectious diseases came to an end. With such \u201cnew\u201d diseases as Legionnaire\u2019s Disease, SARS, West Nile Virus and especially HIV/AIDS, the routes and vectors of infection had multiplied enormously. The dread that AIDS inspired was amplified by its unclear etiology and lack of effective treatment.

Here is a case where the television and cinematic depictions of aliens reflect not dread or terror of society but rather its highest aspirations. The Starship Enterprise\u2019s crew is a microcosm of a United Nations; earthlings and aliens are up against the same galactic threats and must confront the challenge together if they are to survive. The prime directive conveys a not-so-subtle anti-colonial and anti-imperialist message to be sure, but it can also be interpreted as a warning to countries to think twice before using force on recalcitrant adversaries. \u201cStar Trek,\u201d in both iterations, represents a social dream, but a dream that can change depending on the circumstances.

The three beings are weird hybrids, occupying an ambiguous position between the living and the dead, the human and the animal, the mortal and the immortal. They inspire both dread and fascination. (Certainly the recent appeal of vampire novels and movies like \u201cThe Twilight\u201d series attests to the enduring obsession with vampires.) The Wolf Man or werewolf embodies all that is untamable and uncontrollable, the beast within us all. The original Wolf Man, played by Lon Chaney, Jr. in the 1941 film of the same name, is infected with a terrible disease because of a gypsy curse. A sympathetic priest shelters the young man in his church but warns him that the only way he can avoid the effects of the curse is to remain inside the church. As soon as he steps outside he is at risk of being turned into a beast, and of course, he does. His attraction to a beautiful peasant girl proves too much of a temptation to resist. It is notable that the Wolf Man suffered from being raised by a distant father who never appreciated him.

While the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association classifies psychiatric afflictions using an elaborate system of categories, this trinity of affinities does much the same thing on a metaphorical level; Frankenstein, Dracula, and the werewolf represent forms of mental illness and in that sense pose a perpetual challenge to our ability to maintain a sound mind and body in a humanistic society.",

If \u201c2001\u201d reflects the zeitgeist of the Seventies, and \u201cAlien Nation\u201d reflects currents in the Nineties, \u201cDr. Donovan\u2019s Brain,\u201d based on a novel by Curt Siodmak, taps into the fears and uncertainties of the postwar era.

Dr. Cory doesn\u2019t need to worry about government approval for his research; he\u2019s independently wealthy and operates his own lab in an isolated community where there\u2019s little risk of prying neighbors. He and his assistant remove the monkey\u2019s brain and put it in a fish tank. To their delight, the brain still shows sign of electrical activity. At that point there is a call from the police. A small plane has crashed nearby and there is only one survivor who is badly injured. Dr. Cory tries to treat this man who dies in spite of his efforts. Inspired by his success preserving the monkey\u2019s brain, Dr. Cory decides to see if he cannot keep the pilot\u2019s brain going as well. How to communicate with the brain remains a problem until Dr. Cory has an inspiration: he will try telepathy. But the brain he\u2019s determined to keep alive turns out to belong to the notorious W.H. Donovan, a ruthless millionaire. Dr. Cory proves no match for the brain, which takes control and uses him to murder the not-so-late Donovan\u2019s enemies.",
