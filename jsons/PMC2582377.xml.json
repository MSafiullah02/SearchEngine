Comparative sequence analysis shows that most of the structural proteins of FCoV C1Je are very closely related to those of FIPV 79-1146 with amino acid identities exceeding 90% (\nTable 3). However, this is not the case for the S protein, which shares only 43.3% amino acid identity between the two isolates. Since 80\u201390% of field strain FCoVs are serotype I (Hohdatsu et al, 1992, Benetka et al, 2004), the FCoV C1Je isolate is likely to be a type I virus. The amino acid identity of the FCoV C1Je S protein with that of published FCoV type I S protein sequence data is very high (>85%) (\nTable 4) confirming that it as a type I strain. FIPV 79-1146 is a serotype II isolate and this is illustrated by the finding that the FIPV 79-1146 S protein shares strong (>90%) amino acid identity with published CCoV isolates (\nTable 5). Previous predictions based on limited sequence data have identified type II FCoV strains with a double recombination event occurring in the 5\u2032 half of ORF1b (Herrewegh et al 1998) and between the S and M genes (Motokawa et al 1996). The FIPV 79-1146 and FCoV C1Je S genes and their flanking sequences were aligned and a graph of the relative nucleotide identities was plotted. This was used to make a prediction for the putative crossover sites of FIPV 79-1146 with CCoV (\nFig 4). The upstream crossover site was predicted to lie at position 20,119\u201320,200 (3\u2032 end of ORF1b) and the downstream crossover site at position 24,328\u201324,329 (3\u2032 end of S gene) in the FIPV 79-1146 genome (GenBank accession number DQ010921). A short conserved region of approximately 900 nucleotides lying within the predicted recombination site is likely to represent the heptad repeat sequences in the S2 subdomain which are essential for fusogenic activity and are conserved throughout coronaviruses (Bosch et al, 2003, de Haan and Rottier, 2005).",

Although the encoded proteins appear to be analogous to those of FIPV 79-1146 and are of similar length, the amino acid conservation is not high (Table 3). This may reflect the fact that these ORFs are believed to be dispensable for replication in cell culture and are thus unlikely to be conserved in the laboratory-adapted strain of FIPV 79-1146 (Haijema et al 2004). As in FIPV 79-1146, ORF3c of FCoV C1Je appears to be defunct and has a stop codon after only 16 amino acids. However, the introduction of only two nucleotide mutations would enable extension of the reading frame to overlap with that of ORF E (\nFig 5). Analysis of the accessory gene 7 region of the FCoV C1Je genome identifies two ORFs, which have translation products sharing high amino acid identity with proteins 7a and 7b of FIPV 79-1146. However, unlike the FIPV 79-1146 ORF7b, which appears to terminate early as a result of a single nucleotide mutation (C28,374 to U28,374) (Dye and Siddell 2005), the FCoV C1Je ORF7b is intact.",

As expected there was significant diversity in the S gene region resulting from the evolutionary recombination of FIPV 79-1146 with CCoV (Herrewegh et al 1998). The discontinuous transcription method used by coronaviruses is very similar to that of the template switching that occurs during similarity-assisted or high frequency copy-choice RNA recombination (Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005, Sawicki et al, 2006). Recombination is a common phenomenon amongst coronaviruses (Wang et al, 1993, Schaad and Baric, 1994, Collisson et al, 1995, Rest and Mindell, 2003, Johnson et al, 2005) and it may have greater evolutionary significance than the slow process of genetic drift. It provides a mechanism for the rapid formation of new viral strains with dramatically altered tropisms and pathogenicity, which can have a significant impact on host disease. First, it raises the threat of potentially lethal phenotypes emerging over a very short evolutionary time scale and second, it compounds the difficulties of vaccine production resulting from the heterogeneity of virus populations. This again emphasises the importance of investigating current field strain viruses rather than relying solely on laboratory-adapted isolates.",

The amino acid identity of the nsp3 regions was, however, slightly lower at 86.9% and this was largely due to the presence of an extra 65 amino acids in FCoV C1Je. The closely related coronavirus Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) also contains similar additional amino acids within its nsp3 region (Penzes et al 2001) and it is most likely that a 65 amino acid deletion has occurred in FIPV 79-1146 during its passage in cell culture.

It has long been suspected that these genes confer a selective advantage in vivo but are not required in vitro (Herrewegh and Vennema, 1995, Kennedy et al, 2001, Haijema et al, 2003), and that analysis of sequences derived directly from clinical material might, therefore, provide some insight into their importance. Both gene 3 and gene 7 regions have also been implicated in viral pathogenicity. For example, mutant viruses containing either 3abc or 7ab cluster deletions multiply well in cell culture but show an attenuated phenotype in the cat (Haijema et al 2004). Interestingly, cats vaccinated with either of these viral mutants showed some protection against a lethal homologous challenge but vaccination with a mutant virus lacking both gene clusters provided no protection (Haijema et al 2004). It is certainly noteworthy that ORF7b is intact in the clinical strain but not in FIPV 79-1146. This region, along with ORF3c, has been previously implicated in viral pathogenicity. For example, investigation of paired FECV/FIPV samples from various geographical locations has suggested that the FIPV may arise from deletion mutations in the FECV accessory genes (Vennema et al 1998). Further investigation into the function of the encoded 7b protein would certainly be rewarding. It has previously been shown that the 3c gene region of FIPV 79-1146 is degenerate but that it could be restored by just two nucleotide insertions that would enable its extension to overlap with ORF E (Dye and Siddell 2005). It was, therefore, suspected that the ORF3c of FCoV C1Je might be intact, but this was not the case. It is difficult to speculate on the implications of this finding but is does at least suggest that the 3c protein may have restricted functional significance in vivo.",

The finding of a 100% nucleotide identity in the structural and accessory gene regions of the enteric virus (FCoV C1Je) and the non-enteric virus (FCoV C1Li) does not support this view. In fact, it provides a powerful argument opposing the \u2018internal mutation theory\u2019. However, there are some limitations that may also explain this result. For example, consensus sequencing will mask minority virus populations and it is possible that a second viral isolate is present at low levels within the cat 1 jejunum sample. One potential model would be that following immune impairment in cats with well-progressed FIP disease, pathogenic FIPV is able to replicate uncontrollably and migrates back to the gut where viral loads are able to exceed those of the enteric FECV strains. Secondly, it is possible that the important determinants of pathogenicity are located in the proteins encoded in the replicase gene region. It is certainly conceivable that interaction between proteins of the replicase complex and cellular proteins could have critical importance and that alterations in this interaction could lead to altered pathogenicity. It is known, for example, that significant CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes are located in the replicase proteins of Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) (Stohlman et al 1993) and it is already clear that some coronavirus non-structural proteins have profound effects on cellular processes such as deubiquitination and Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP)-ribose metabolism (Barretto et al, 2005, Putics et al, 2005). The next step would certainly be to obtain the full genomic RNA sequence of FCoV C1Li so that the replicase gene regions can be compared.",

For example, does the FCoV strain within a defined multi-cat population remain conserved over time or are new strains constantly emerging? If new strains do emerge, are they the result of original strain mutation or \u2018de novo\u2019 infections from external sources? Are all coronavirus positive cats within a household infected with the same viral strain and are some cats co-infected with several FCoV strains simultaneously? Is the FCoV strain present in the gut always a reflection of the predominant systemic strain, and similarly, do cats with FIP excrete pathogenic FIPV or only FECV? Is there a consistent mutation associated with pathogenicity? Various authors have previously addressed many of these questions (Addie, 2000, Addie and Jarrett, 2001, Pedersen, 2002). However, only small sections of the viral genome have so far been considered and interpretation of the findings has proved difficult. Now that the genomic RNA sequence of a type I clinical strain has been elucidated it will be much easier and quicker to sequence more extensive specific regions from further viral field strains. It is hoped that this will help to shed more light on the findings of future epidemiological studies and increase their significance.",
