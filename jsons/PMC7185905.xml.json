A total of 463,412 cases worldwide and 20,912 deaths till now. [1] Amongst the currently Infected Patients, 328,698 a total of 314,319 (96%) have mild Condition and 14,379 (4%) are serious or critical. Amongst the closed cases of 134,714, the mortality was in 20,912 (16%) [1]. The early reported mortality rate of 4.3% [2] appears to be lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but this initial figure is believed likely to be an underestimation, as most of the confirmed patients are still inpatients, and their condition is not yet resolved. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production, diarrhea, and sore throat are less common. [3] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to pneumonia and multi-organ failure [4].",

[5, 6] With the outbreak of COVID 19, there has been redistribution of manpower and resources to critically meet the current and anticipated hospital service needs. Due to total lockdown announced in our country, the patients availing the medical help for minor ailments has been reduced considerably. Also all the elective surgical procedures have been postponed for a month or so as to avoid unnecessary overcrowding and possible exposure and spread of coronavirus. There has also been a reduction in elective clinics and operations to mobilize manpower to acute specialties combatting the outbreak and maximize hospital beds numbers available in anticipation of the outbreak. There is also understandably fear from the public in visiting hospitals.",

This outbreak has additionally seen a high morbidity among healthcare workers, much like previous outbreaks of human coronavirus. The first fatality of a physician documented globally was that of an otolaryngology physician in Wuhan on January 25, 2020, whose situation was similar to that of an otolaryngologist who died of SARS in 2003. Thus, it is important that otolaryngologists and physicians globally stay abreast of this outbreak and realise the need for essential precautionary practices that are potentially crucial in protecting themselves and patients during this epidemic. In many regions globally, it is a very common practice for patients with upper respiratory tract infections to seek family practitioners and otolaryngologists as a primary care physician. Such a practice inadvertently poses inherent potentiall risks for physicians examining patients potentially carrying the virus.",

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is most important in preventing transmission of the virus. These usually consist of standard precautionary measures like gloves, mask and gown.

Considering the situation in developing countries like ours there is economic burden of providing the PPE to all the health care professionals (including doctors, nursing staff, supporting staff, ICU technicians, laboratory technicians), law handling forces (police and soldiers who manage the mobs during the Lockdown), infected and non-infected patients and their relatives. It\u2019s a tremendous health care burden protecting all these key people who are prone to risk of exposure. We need simple solutions and it is the responsibility of the Government to take care of all the people at risk. So finding a simple economical solution is a must in all the developing countries and to provide the safety protection equipment to one and all to prevent the spread of COVID 19. In our country with a large population, supplying PPE to all the health care workers of all hospitals definitely is an economic burden. There is need for cheap, disposable face masks, eye protection, gloves and gowns, enough safety gear for medical workers, sick people and for the public. Procurement of such large amount of protection wear is difficult as it runs out of stock due to high demands. There is a tremendous need that the masks and the protection wear to be prepared by the health workers for self-protection. With a continuous and constant contemplation, we have come up with a solution, which is economic, simple solution as well as easily prepared. We have designed a face mask which will cover not only nose and mouth but also the whole of the face thereby preventing the exposure to the eyes, nose, mouth and face.",

With the disposable masks available in the market are running out of stock as the demand is more of such masks. As a result of which, the health care workers exposed to the suspected/potential COVID 19 patients are deprived of even masks. In such situations, the PPE is definitely out of question. Under these circumstances, it is of immense importance that the health care workers use at least some sort of protection or a barrier and thus prevent exposure and thus the risks. Our mask, though a simple one, definitely serves as a protection and effective barrier than no protection at all. It can be used in adjunct with the N95 mask, or a simple disposable mask or a simple double folded polyester cloth mask. Such masks can be prepared by the hospital staff within the hospital itself and can be sterilised too as mentioned in quantity as required by the staff. So it wouldn\u2019t increase the burden on the economy of the country and makes the health care workers self-sufficient. It obviates the need for additional eye wear by the health care workers.
