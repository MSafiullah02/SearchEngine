Prior to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV ) outbreak in 2003, human CoVs were only known to cause mild, self-limiting upper respiratory diseases. Approximately 10 years after the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV emerged in the Middle East where it then spread to 27 different countries, and to date (December 2018, WHO) there have been 2278 laboratory-confirmed cases and 806 associated deaths for a case fatality rate of 35%. Most of these cases have occurred in the Middle East, aside from an outbreak of ~200 infected individuals in South Korea in 2015 [1].",

            "text": " Infectious clones are highly valuable research tools that enable modification of viral genomes to better understand their fundamental biology, develop novel vaccine candidates, and test antiviral therapeutics. Soon after identifying MERS-CoV as the causative agent of MERS, two distinct infectious clones were reported for MERS-CoV [2, 3]. These infectious clones were engineered using in vitro ligation or bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), each of which had been used previously for CoVs [4\u20136]. In vitro ligation uses unique type II restriction endonucleases that cleave several bases away from their recognition site, allowing for the reassembly of authentic CoV genomes from smaller fragments. Each fragment is separately maintained in its own small plasmid for efficient genetic modification using traditional molecular cloning methods. Separating specific nucleotide sequences in ORF1A helped to eliminate the problem of these sequences being toxic for bacteria. A T7 promoter is inserted at the 5\u2032 end of the genome, allowing for in vitro transcription of the viral RNA and subsequent transfection into mammalian cells for virus production. In contrast, BACs allow for the stable propagation of full-length CoV cDNA in bacteria, due to the ability to restrict their copy number to 1 or 2 plasmids per cell. Different restriction fragments of these BACs can be sub-cloned into smaller vectors for efficient modification, or the full-length genome can be modified using lambda red recombination, which will be discussed here. CoV BAC plasmids contain a CMV promoter 5\u2032 of the viral genome, allowing for transcription of the viral genome following transfection of BAC DNA into mammalian cells. In addition, the CoV BACs contain a polyA tail, a Hepatitis D Virus (HDV) ribozyme , and bovine growth hormone (BGH ) termination and polyadenylation signals to create genomic RNA with an authentic 3\u2032 end. The full-length nature of BAC DNA and the CMV promoter subvert the need for in vitro ligation or transcription to recover infectious virus. BACs were initially developed in the early 1990s, and by the mid-late 1990s they were utilized by Herpes virologists for modification of these large DNA viruses, which revolutionized the field. A few years later a BAC for a CoV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV ), was engineered, and since then BACs have been successfully developed for several CoVs including feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), OC-43, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, murine hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and the SARS-like CoV WIV-1 [2, 4, 7\u201312]. Thus, it is likely that BAC-based reverse genetics could be useful for any novel or emergent CoV.",

            "text": "Lambda red recombination utilizes bacteriophage enzymes Exo, Beta, and Gam (Red proteins) to mediate homologous recombination near the ends of linear double-stranded DNA [13, 14]. PCR products containing positive selection markers are suitable substrates for these enzymes, so long as they bear extensions of 40\u201350 bases that are homologous to the target sequence. A major advancement in this technique came with the development of an E. coli strain, DY380, where the Red proteins were placed under the control of a temperature-inducible promoter [15]. Several methods for removing the positive selection markers from the viral genomes have been developed, including flanking sequences with FRT or loxP sites [16], or utilizing positive and negative selection markers on a single gene cassette, such as the Galactose Kinase (GalK)-KanR gene cassette [17]. These methods both have certain downfalls, including the retention of small FRT or loxP sites following removal of the marker, or the unintended removal of negative selection markers by repeat sequences in the BAC plasmid. To improve the efficiency of removing the positive selection marker, a unique method utilizing the I-SceI homing endonuclease under an arabinose-inducible promoter was developed (Fig. 1) [18]. I-SceI is an endonuclease with an 18 bp recognition site that is not present in the E. coli genome, making it safe to express in E. coli. In the method described here, this recognition site is engineered on a plasmid ( pEP-KanS) just outside of the positive selection marker, and its cleavage with the I-SceI enzyme allows for the removal of the positive selection marker by intramolecular Red recombination utilizing sequence duplication introduced in the original PCR primers. This method can be utilized to introduce any type of modification into the BAC DNA, including mutations, deletions, and insertions. Here I will outline the procedure for this highly efficient method to engineer markerless modifications, focusing on single point mutations in the full-length MERS-CoV BAC.",

If the combined amount of cells and 10% glycerol is greater than 550 \u03bcL, transfer the suspension to a cold Eppendorf tube and pellet the cells for 2 min at 5000 \u00d7 g and 4 \u00b0C. After spinning the cells, remove an appropriate amount of supernatant such that ~500 \u03bcL of cell suspension remains. Resuspend the cells to a homogenous solution and aliquot 50 \u03bcL to prefrozen Eppendorf tubes and flash-freeze tubes in liquid nitrogen or a dry ice-methanol bath. Use immediately or store at \u221280 \u00b0C. Cells are typically good for 6\u201312 months, but may be useful even after several years.\n",

            "text": "\nDesign and order Kanr-I-SceI primers with 60 bp homology to the region of interest flanking the desired site to be modified (Fig. 1a). To design simple point mutations, start by developing a 60 bp flanking sequence, calling each 20 base pair section as A, B, and C. Then incorporate the desired mutation at the end of section B (40th base pair, or the 39th and 40th base pair if two changes are required). Finally, attach this sequence to the 22 bp Kanr-I-SceI sequence below to create your forward recombination primer. To create the reverse recombination primer, create a new block of 20 bp we will call section D\u2032 that is the reverse complement of the sequence immediately downstream from section C. These 20 bp will be followed on your primer by sections C\u2032 and B\u2032, the reverse complements to sections B and C, with B\u2032 containing the desired mutations. Finally, add the 23 bp Kanr-I-SceI sequence to finish the reverse primer. During negative selection, sections B/C will recombine with B\u2032/C\u2032 leading to the loss of the KanR-I-SceI cassette (Fig. 1g). For deletion mutants, leave out the desired sequence from your primers. For instance, to delete sections D/E/F, simply create the forward primer with sections A/B/C, and the reverse primer with sections G\u2032/C\u2032/B\u2032. Insertions of small sequences can be achieved by adding the entire insertion sequence at the 3\u2032 end of the forward primer, and at least 50 bp of reverse complement sequence at the 3\u2032 end of the reverse primer (Fig. 2). Larger insertions may require the development of a full plasmid, or potentially the use of nested PCRs. For additional details, see ref. [18]. While designing recombination primers (indicated below), remember to also order short primers about 100\u2013200 bp outside of the insertion site to check for the proper insertion of the gene cassette by PCR.Set up PCR reaction and perform reaction according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol with following modifications (Fig. 1b).For a PCR template, use ~50 ng of the pEP-KanS plasmid.Use 1 \u03bcL high-fidelity polymerase (see\nNote 10).For the annealing temperature, I prefer to use a step-down procedure lowering the annealing temperature by 1 \u00b0C starting at 68 \u00b0C and continuing the PCR reaction for 25 cycles. Using this method we rarely see spurious PCR products.Analyze the PCR product on an agarose gel with ethidium bromide and image it using a UV-gel box and gel-imaging software. PCR product should be ~1.2 kb.Purify the PCR product using the PureLink PCR purification kit (see\nNote 5). Use binding buffer B3 according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol to remove primer dimers from the mixture. Elute DNA into 44 \u03bcL of water.DpnI digest the pEP-KanS plasmid in the purified PCR product (Fig. 1b). DpnI specifically cleaves methylated DNA and is needed to digest the pEP-KanS plasmid used in the PCR reaction. It has a 4 bp recognition site so it should cleave DNA approximately every 250 bp. Without this digestion all of your transformants will maintain the pEP-KanS plasmid as its transformation is much more efficient than the recombination of the PCR product.

Incubate at 32 \u00b0C and 220 rpm for 3\u20135 h. This is when the recombination occurs (Fig. 1d) (see\nNote 11).

To speed this process up, colonies may be collected off the plate on day 3 and directly tested by PCR. Colonies that pass the PCR screen can then progress to the negative selection protocol (3.5) (see\nNote 13).\n\n",

            "text": "\n DH10B cells are a standard E. coli strain used for general cloning. DH10B cells are recombination-deficient (recA1) and endonuclease I-deficient (endA1) and have constitutive deoxyribose synthesis for improved cloning of large plasmids. These traits make these cells ideal for the long-term storage of BAC plasmids. GS1783 cells are a derivative of DH10B cells that contain the Red recombination genes under a temperature sensitive promoter and the I-SceI homing endonuclease under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter [20].For creating long oligos, we prefer Invitrogen as a supplier, as they can provide oligos up to 100 nt at their standard price per base. Many companies do not make oligos longer than 60 nt at their standard rates, and thus will charge a significant amount more for the 80\u201390 nt oligos required for this protocol.While many companies sell BAC-prep kits which will work for these purposes, these columns are often at least 3\u00d7 the cost of the Nucleobond Xtra Midi Kit. We have tested the Xtra Midi Kit side by side with a BAC-prep kit and found little to no difference in CoV BAC DNA yield.For purifying PCR products, we prefer the Invitrogen PureLink PCR Purification Kit because it includes a buffer that allows DNA products of <300 bp to go through the column. This helps remove primer dimers from the PCR reaction that could interfere with recombination.A 42 \u00b0C shaking water bath is essential for this procedure. The bacterial cultures need to heat up to 42 \u00b0C quickly to properly induce the Red enzymes. A shaking water bath is significantly better than a regular shaking incubator at quickly transferring heat to the bacterial culture.We have tried several different transfection reagents, and Lipofectamine 2000 has worked the best for us. That does not mean other transfection reagents won\u2019t work, feel free to try whichever reagent you prefer.It is important to always culture GS1783 cells at 32 \u00b0C or lower due to the potential for leaky expression of the Red enzymes at temperatures below the induction temperature of 42 \u00b0C.Some shaking water baths cannot shake at 200 rpm; if this is the case, simply shake at a reasonable speed for the shaker.We have occasionally had problems obtaining a PCR product when using the manufacturer recommended 0.5 \u03bcL of high-fidelity polymerase. Using 1 \u03bcL of polymerase provides more consistent results.Unlike a typical 1 h recovery following electroporation, it is important to incubate these cultures for several hours in SOC to allow time for recombination to occur. A recovery time of 5 h or greater is preferred, with a minimal recovery time being 3 h.Occasionally, we find that following PCR some clones have bands that correspond to both the WT BAC and the desired KanR-I-SceI insert BAC. It is likely due to at least two copies of BAC DNA being present in the same cell. Unless the molar ratio of the KanR-I-SceI insert to the WT BAC is very large, these clones should be avoided.After positive selection, we do not check the BAC by restriction digest, because (a) we find that in many cases the amount of BAC DNA from a miniprep is insufficient for a readable digest, and (b) we find that the colonies that pass the replica plating and PCR tests rarely if ever have any significant problems concerning removing or duplicating regions of the MERS-CoV BAC DNA.First, colonies may take over 1 day before they are visible. Second, while the efficiency of the negative selection can be very low, any colonies that have grown on LB-cml plates but do not grow on LB-cml/kan plates are very likely correct. Therefore, we go directly to starting large-scale cultures for these clones. That way we can do the final diagnostic tests and we can prepare for the BAC transfection and viral recovery at the same time.A KpnI digest of pBAC-MERS-CoV results in DNA fragments of 19.1, 13.8, 3.9, and 1.5 kb. We have found this is the best digest for diagnostic evaluation of the MERS-CoV BAC; however other enzymes or enzyme combinations will work as well. Be sure to use a low-percentage agarose gel to effectively separate the large DNA molecules.Other laboratories use BHK-21 cells for the initial transfection since these cells are highly transfectable. The transfected cells can be overlaid on the Vero-81 or Huh-7 cells for further outgrowth of the recombinant virus.It is feasible to wait o/n to change the media of the transfected Vero 81 cells, but this does result in an increase in the cytotoxicity induced by Lipofectamine. This is not feasible if you are using Huh-7 cells.Mutant viruses that do not replicate as well as WT virus may require increased amounts of P0 virus.It is also beneficial to check the integrity of the entire MERS-CoV genome by RT-PCR after several passages as MERS-CoV tends to occasionally delete sections of the accessory proteins.\n",
