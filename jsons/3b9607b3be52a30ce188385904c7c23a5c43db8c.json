However, in the future it would be beneficial to also determine the sequence of the capsid-encoding region, because this region provides important information about the phylogenetic grouping of these viruses. The capsid sequence could also be used to establish whether the isolates in this study had undergone recombination, which in the caliciviruses most commonly occurs between the polymerase and capsid-encoding regions of the genome. 26 To date, there have been no reports of bovine noroviruses associated with disease in humans. However, there has been speculation about the possibility of zoonotic transmission. [27] [28] [29] Veterinarians in the Netherlands, particularly those with exposure to cattle, were more frequently found to have IgG antibodies against recombinant bovine norovirus virus-like particles (VLP) than the general population, who are less likely to come into contact with cattle. 27 In addition, a study looking at the acquisition of antibodies to different norovirus genogroups in children in India found antibodies against bovine noroviruses, using recombinant VLPs. 30 However, cross-reactivity could not be ruled out in these studies. In fact, cross-reactive epitopes have been found in bovine and human norovirus capsids. 31, 32 Given that bovine noroviruses have not been reported in humans and human noroviruses have only been detected very infrequently in cattle, 33 if zoonotic transmission is possible, it is likely to be an uncommon occurrence. Recombination, including between genogroups, has been reported for noroviruses and other caliciviruses. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Norovirus recombination most commonly occurs at the junction of the first two ORFs. 26, 39, 40 This region of the genome is highly conserved and it is thought that the RNA secondary structure in this region is involved in the recombination process. 39 As the majority of noroviruses cannot be cultured, the precise mechanisms of recombination have not been extensively studied and it is not known how much conservation of the RNA sequence or secondary structure conservation is required to allow two strains to recombine.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 655, "end": 657, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 835, "end": 839, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 840, "end": 844, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 845, "end": 849, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1127, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1316, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1475, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1478, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1617, "end": 1619, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1805, "end": 1809, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1810, "end": 1814, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1819, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1824, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1829, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1917, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1921, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1922, "end": 1924, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2081, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although the primary aim of this study was to investigate bovine noroviruses and neboviruses in Australian samples of calf diarrhoea, as neither of these agents has been detected in this country, a secondary aim was to investigate other viral agents of diarrhoea.
