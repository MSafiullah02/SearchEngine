Since that time, the disease has spread worldwide to an extent not seen in decades and poses an important global health threat[1]. It is now known that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which produces symptoms that are much more severe than the seasonal flu, with fatality rates around 1.4%[2]. The virus is transmitted person-to-person and health-care professionals may serve as a mechanism for hospital associated transmission and outbreaks[3]. Healthcare providers are at risk of propagating this disease and this risk is not exclusive to those healthcare workers at the \u2018front lines\u2019 of the pandemic (e.g. emergency department, isolation wards, etc.). In one recent report, upwards of 78% of health-care workers infected were outside of these front line areas, allowing infection to spread[4]. As such, measures to slow the spread of infection have been witnessed worldwide in targeting all departments within hospitals.",

The acute spike in sick patients with COVID-19 in Italy and Spain, for example, showed that hospitals could quickly become depleted of necessary medical equipment to protect patients and staff. A similar situation has been seen in U.S. based hospitals where we have seen key shortages in ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE), and blood products [5, 6, 7]. In response, early recommendations were made by the American College of Surgeons to delay elective surgical procedures in an effort to save PPE and minimize these shortages [8]. A large majority of U.S. hospitals have since cancelled elective surgeries for the immediate future. It is unclear whether similar strategies were taken by governments worldwide, as this would depend on the volume of COVID-19 infected cases in any specific country.",

Some of these patients could be COVID-19 infected and require a surgical intervention in an emergent or semi-urgent basis. Orthopaedic surgeons worldwide are attempting to balance minimizing COVID-19 disease burden while still providing necessary care. To date, it is unknown how arthroplasty surgeons worldwide are altering their practice in the setting of COVID-19.

Some noted that their hospitals cancelled all types of surgeries in response to COVID-19 pandemic (14 responses from countries including Mexico, India, Italy, Chile, Uruguay, United Kingdom, Philippines, Spain, South Africa, and France). Many surgeons noted a shift in their focus to non-surgical clinical care (19), or performing more administrative work (26). Ten respondents noted that they were providing more non-orthopaedic patient care. Twenty-two respondents report that their respective hospitals have been unable to care for all COVID-19 infected patients and a large number have encountered disruptions in both supply and staffing needs.

As more local governments have issued \u2018shelter in place\u2019 laws, blood donations have decreased only adding to the shortage. In an attempt to slow the depletion of these vital resources, many hospitals have cancelled elective surgeries including THA and TKA. Our results suggest that this trend is occurring internationally as well, with 71 practices having cancelled all elective procedures. Sixty-four international surgeons responded that their hospital is experiencing supply disruptions, 41% experiencing staff related disruptions, and 22% will be unable to take care of all infected COVID patients requiring hospitalization.",

Close to half of the respondents endorsed efforts to screen surgical patients for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in an attempt to improve overall safety for all providers. Ultimately, limiting surgical procedures decreases the amount of necessary PPE and as such there appears to be international pressure to decrease amount of elective procedures.",

A survey of orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan, China was recently published examining the effects of utilizing N-95 respirators on COVID transmission [11]. The authors determined that the incidence of infection in orthopaedic surgeons was up to 20.7% in the early stages of the outbreak with the main suspected site of infection occurring on the general wards (i.e. not isolation wards). The use of N-95 respirators was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Thus, they recommend routine wear of the respirator at all times to prevent infection and spread both in the OR and while rounding on the floor. In our study, it was found that 67 surgeons reported using an N-95 respirator to some capacity in the OR, with 32 wearing them in the OR for every surgical procedure. However, over half of responders (58) reported not using an N-95 mask during any inpatient rounding duties. Based on the data available from the Wuhan study, it would seem reasonable to recommend using an N-95 respirator mask at all times; limited access to N-95 respirators may have played a role in the reported numbers in our survey.",

Twenty-two have had to layoff or furlough employees due to economic burdens and the average time practices were estimated to remain open given their current economic scenario was 7.3 weeks. In the U.S., elective procedures account for 48% of hospital costs and potentially an even larger percentage of revenues [12]. Additionally, five musculoskeletal procedures (hip arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty, laminectomy, spinal fusion, and lower extremity fracture care) account for 17% of those elective procedures. Without elective procedures continuing to provide revenue, the financial burden on hospital organizations will only increase. In the U.S., President Donald Trump signed the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act on March 27th, 2020. This $2 trillion relief fund is aimed at aiding individuals, businesses, and state/local governments [13]. The CARES Act provides $100 billion in relief funds to hospitals and healthcare providers, including $30 billion in payment, not loans, that was immediately released to any healthcare provider who billed Medicare in 2019, based on a formula related to their fee-for-service charges [14]. Orthopaedic practices with less than 500 employees are eligible for loan programs through the Small Business Administration. The US Department of Health and Human Services have also announced relaxation of HIPAA requirements and provided waivers for the use of telemedicine during the pandemic in order to ensure care for COVID-19 and non-COVID patients is continued [15]. As gleaned from the survey, a number of international members are using some form of telemedicine to communicate with patients. Maintaining contact with our patients is of paramount importance during this crisis, as practices will need to be reinvigorated once the pandemic resolves.",

Fortunately, 9 respondents endorsed receiving some private financial help either from private loans or their own institution. The vast majority of surgeons (82) reported no financial aid at all. Members of the AAHKS international committee were contacted to discuss the availability of federal aid from their countries. Surgeons from the United Kingdom, Chile, Colombia, New Zealand, Italy, Japan or France have not received any help from their federal governments. Several countries have had some actions towards decreasing taxes or debt relief, or assistance in the public sector, but the resources available are quite limited and usually are not available for surgeons in private practice. In the midst of this global pandemic, the full economic repercussions are unclear; however, surgeons receiving direct aid from international governments remains relatively uncommon at this time.",

Another limitation is the overall response rate of 27%, which raises the potential for non-responder bias. However, we extended the survey to include additional individuals from different arthroplasty societies and these results were found to be generally similar.
