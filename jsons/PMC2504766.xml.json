            "text": "Viral bronchiolitis is a LRTI typically associated with cough, tachypnea, retractions, and diffuse wheezing and rales [8], [9]. Bronchiolitis is a leading cause of hospitalizations in the first year of life, accounting for an estimated 120,000 infant hospitalizations annually [10]. In infants, the etiologic agents of bronchiolitis and other viral respiratory infections associated with wheezing include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza (PIV), adenovirus, and more recently identified viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human boca virus (hBoV) [11], [12], [13], [14]. RSV causes epidemics of bronchiolitis and typically circulates in temperate climates during November to April with peaks in the winter months [11], [15], [16]. In tropical climates, peaks are related to temperature and level of rainfall [17]. RSV infects the majority of children during their first year of life and essentially all children show evidence of RSV infection by age 3 years [18]. The initial RSV infection is typically the most severe, causing lower respiratory tract disease, such as bronchiolitis, in 20% to 30% of infants [11], [18], [19]. Other viruses such as rhinovirus, PIV, and adenovirus circulate nearly year-round with seasonal peaks of illness [10], [11], [19], [20].",

Although, rhinovirus historically was thought to be limited to the upper respiratory tract, investigations have demonstrated that rhinovirus can infect the lower airways, is associated with infant bronchiolitis, and becomes a more dominant pathogen in wheezing illness as children get older [13], [28], [29], [30].",

In the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study, a birth cohort of 1179 infants enrolled May 1980 to January 1985, Wright and colleagues [37] described the epidemiology of LRTIs during infancy. Overall, 80% of infants were followed through the first year of life. In total, 348 children contributed 460 LRTIs evaluated by physicians, with 292 respiratory cultures obtained at the initial illness. The cumulative incidence rate of lower respiratory tract illnesses in the first year of life was 32.9 per 100 children. One percent of infants were hospitalized for their illness. Immunofluorescence and viral culture were employed to detect infection by RSV; PIV types 1, 2 and 3; influenza A and B; adenovirus; enterovirus; cytomegalovirus; and rhinovirus. An infectious agent was identified by viral culture in 193 of 292 (66%) available samples obtained from infants with lower respiratory tract illness. RSV accounted for 65% of the 183 first bronchiolitis diagnoses [37]. Other viruses detected in infants with bronchiolitis diagnoses included PIV types 1, 2, and 3 (14%); influenza A and B (4%); and adenovirus (2%). An Australian cohort of 263 infants with at least one parent with doctor-diagnosed atopy, recruited infants from July 1996 to July 1999 and followed them through the first year of life [38]. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and detailed information were collected prospectively during acute respiratory illnesses and PCR was used to identify viral respiratory pathogens. Acute respiratory illnesses associated with wheeze or \u201crattly chest\u201d were classified as LRTIs. Of the 329 LRTIs, 28.9% were associated with wheeze. Rhinovirus was isolated in 45% of \u201cwheezy\u201d LRTIs, and RSV in 16.8%.",

            "text": "The role of newly identified viruses, such as hMPV and hBoV, in infant wheezing illnesses is still being defined [12], [14], [40], [41], [42]. Williams and colleagues [12], [43] investigated the role of hMPV in LRTIs in children enrolled at birth and followed to age 5 years in a vaccine clinic. HMPV, first identified in 2001, was detected in 20% of 248 available samples obtained from children with lower respiratory tract illness in which no respiratory pathogen was previously detected. HMPV therefore accounted for 12% of lower respiratory tract illnesses in this cohort of otherwise healthy young children [12], [43]. Kesebir and colleagues [14], [44] used available respiratory specimens submitted to a hospital-based clinical virology laboratory (January to December 2004) to investigate the prevalence of hBoV, first identified in 2005. HBoV was detected in 5% of the study samples obtained from children less than 2 years of age and negative for other viruses, although testing for rhinovirus was not performed. Wheezing illness was associated with approximately 50% of the hBoV-associated cases [14]. Allander and colleagues [42] found hBoV as the sole virus isolated in approximately 5% (12 of 259) of respiratory samples from children under 3 years of age who were hospitalized with acute wheezing. In general, the use of sensitive molecular techniques has confirmed the major role of RSV in infant bronchiolitis, broadened the role of viruses that were previously difficult to detect by culture, and allowed for the identification of new respiratory viruses. Furthermore, studies using PCR have demonstrated that while RSV appears to be the virus most commonly associated with wheezing in infants, rhinovirus plays a more prominent role after the age of 2 to 3 years [30], [45].",

Rakes and colleagues [30] conducted a cross-sectional study of 70 children who presented to the emergency department with wheezing between January 1993 and April 1994, and compared them with 59 controls who presented to the emergency department with nonrespiratory complaints over the same period. Respiratory viruses were isolated in over 82% of the wheezing children less than 2 years of age. RSV was the most common virus detected in children less than 2 years of age (68%) and was not detected in any control subjects. However, in the children less than 2 years of age, similar proportions of nasal aspirates from those with wheezing and controls were positive for rhinovirus (41%). In the children older than 2 years, viruses were detected in 83% of wheezing children. Rhinovirus was detected by PCR in 71% of the wheezing older children compared with 36% of the nonwheezing controls. RSV was detected in 6% of the wheezing children who were 2 years or older. In addition, the investigators found that 48% of the wheezing children who were 2 years or older had a positive test for rhinovirus and a measured marker of atopy compared with only 5% of the respective control group. In a similar 1-year study (2000\u20132001), 133 children (2 months to 18 years) admitted to the hospital for wheezing were compared with 133 age-matched controls admitted without wheezing [45]. In the younger children, virus was detected in 84% of the wheezing children compared with 54% of the respective controls. Consistent with other studies, RSV was the predominant virus in the younger children during the winter. However, rhinovirus was detected more frequently in young children hospitalized for wheezing from April through November. Among children older than 3 years, a respiratory virus was significantly more likely to be detected in children admitted for wheezing, than children without wheezing. Rhinovirus detection was significantly associated with wheezing. In addition, wheezing was strongly associated with atopy, as measured by total IgE and skin testing, in the children older than 3 years. These studies highlight the different pathogens associated with wheezing illnesses by age and the association of rhinovirus and atopy with wheezing in children beyond infancy.",

Most, but not all, previous studies have primarily included case infants who were hospitalized with bronchiolitis during infancy. Therefore, studies examining wheezing only after hospitalization for bronchiolitis during infancy may not reflect the outcomes of the large majority of infants with bronchiolitis who have only outpatient visits, emergency department visits, or no health care visit at all [75]. Although several early studies focused solely on RSV bronchiolitis or were conducted before routine testing for rhinovirus was available, more recent studies have used PCR to investigate the association of non-RSV bronchiolitis and subsequent wheezing [62], [66], [69], [70], [74], [76], [77]. Therefore, the diverse group of research investigations in this area includes case infants in whom the specific viral agents of bronchiolitis were not determined, case infants with only RSV bronchiolitis, and case infants with either RSV or non-RSV bronchiolitis. Overall, there is convincing evidence from several cohorts that RSV and rhinovirus bronchiolitis during infancy are risk factors or markers for subsequent wheezing within the first decade of life [47], [55], [65], [66], [67], [69], [70], [71], [74].",

Sigurs and colleagues [70], [71] studied the relationship between RSV hospitalization during infancy and asthma in a small cohort of Swedish children. This prospective study included 47 children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis during infancy and 93 matched controls. The investigators defined the study outcomes as \u201casthma\u201d (three or more episodes of bronchial obstruction verified by a physician), \u201crecurrent wheezing\u201d (three or more episodes of bronchial obstruction not physician verified), and \u201cany wheezing\u201d (asthma, recurrent wheezing, or one or two episodes of wheezing). At age 7.5 years, approximately one third of children with a history of severe RSV bronchiolitis were diagnosed with asthma and these children were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of asthma than their nonhospitalized controls [70]. Though the cohort was small, the evidence from this study points to the likelihood of increased risk of asthma through age 13 among children who have a history of severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy [71].",

            "text": "Historical data also demonstrate the increased risk of wheezing or asthma after non-RSV bronchiolitis and emerging data suggest that children with a history of LRTI with viruses other than RSV may have an even greater risk of subsequent wheezing. As early as the 1960s, in a study of hospitalized children less than 5 years of age, Simon and Jordan [79] speculated that children with non-RSV bronchiolitis had a predisposition to develop asthma. Murray and colleagues [68] conducted an investigation of 73 children with either RSV or non-RSV bronchiolitis hospitalization during infancy and a retrospectively recruited nonhospitalized control group. The investigators found that the children hospitalized for bronchiolitis during infancy were more likely than controls to have wheezing (42.5% versus 15.0%) at 5.5 years [68]. In addition, wheezing by parent report (34% versus 13%) and use of bronchodilators (33% versus 3%) at 9 to 10 years after the initial bronchiolitis episode were more common in children with a history of a bronchiolitis hospitalization [47]. Fjaerli and colleagues [67] found that a group of 57 children hospitalized with bronchiolitis during infancy, whether RSV-positive or RSV-negative, were more likely to be under a doctor's care for asthma at age 7, compared with a retrospectively recruited, nonhospitalized control group of 64 children. Piippo-Savolainen and colleagues [80] also found that children hospitalized for bronchiolitis in the first 2 years of life were more likely to have asthma in young adulthood. In a subset of participants, Piippo-Savolainen and colleagues [63] found that adults with a history of non-RSV bronchiolitis during the first 2 years of life were at greater risk of developing asthma than were comparable adults with a history of RSV bronchiolitis. In a cohort of 81 children, Kotaniemi-Syrj\u00e4nen and colleagues [66] investigated the relationship of non-RSV bronchiolitis during the first 2 years of life and the subsequent risk of asthma around age 7 years. They found that a rhinovirus-positive hospitalization for wheezing during the first 2 years of life was associated with a fourfold increased risk of asthma around age 7 years, compared with nonrhinovirus hospitalizations. Finally, Garcia-Garcia and colleagues [62] found an increased risk of early childhood asthma in children previously hospitalized with hMPV (23 children) or RSV (32 children) bronchiolitis compared with a control group hospitalized with gastroenteritis (38 children). Overall, this data suggests that viral LRTI with viruses other than RSV are associated with as high or even higher risk of childhood asthma then RSV-associated LRTI.",

These studies have allowed for the investigation of the association of viral LRTI that did not require hospitalization with subsequent wheezing. In the cohort of children enrolled at birth in the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study, Stein and colleagues [4], [69] found that children with a history of RSV LRTI in the first 3 years of life were 3.2 times more likely to have parental report of infrequent wheeze (one to three episodes of wheezing in past year) and 4.3 times more likely to have frequent wheeze (more than three episodes of wheezing in the past year) at 6 years, compared with infants with no LRTIs in the first 3 years of life. However, the association of RSV LRTI during infancy and infrequent and frequent wheeze decreased with age and neither was significant at age 13 years. At age 13 years, 517 of the 888 children (58%) followed for the first 3 years of life were included. The investigators suggested that, although RSV LRTI during early childhood was a risk factor for recurrent wheezing, it was not a risk factor for atopic asthma.",

The COAST cohort is different from the Tucson cohort in that it includes only children with an increased risk of developing asthma [2]. All of the children in the cohort have at least one parent with respiratory allergies or physician-diagnosed asthma. The investigators found that children with at least one moderate to severe rhinovirus-associated wheezing illness during infancy had a 6.6-fold greater chance of subsequent wheezing in the third year of life and those with RSV had a threefold greater chance of wheezing in the third year of life [74]. In the combined moderate-severe illness group without wheezing, there was an increased risk for wheezing in the third year of life (odds ratio 3.9; 95% CI 1.1\u201315). This study is the first to show that, particularly in genetically susceptible hosts, even moderate to severe viral infections during infancy that are not associated with wheezing or hospitalization are associated with an increased risk of subsequent wheezing [74]. In another birth cohort of infants at high risk for asthma development, Kusel and colleagues [81] found that children with a history of \u201cwheezy\u201d LRTI infections with rhinovirus or RSV during infancy were at increased risk of having wheezing at age 5 years.",

These approaches include comparing the prevalence of respiratory viruses detected in asthma patients with and without acute exacerbations, and comparing virus detection in patients with asthma to that in patients without asthma in community, emergency department, or hospital settings. In general, many studies before the use of sensitive molecular techniques detected lower rates of viral infection during acute asthma exacerbations [83], [87], [88], [91], [92], [93]. More recently, the use of PCR has resulted in increased detection of respiratory viruses in patients with asthma exacerbations [94].",

Khetsuriani and colleagues [98] studied children aged 2 to 17 years with persistent asthma. Sixty-five children with acute asthma exacerbations and 77 children with well-controlled asthma were enrolled. One or more viruses were detected in 63% of the patients with asthma exacerbations and in 23.4% of the patients with well-controlled asthma. Rhinovirus was detected among 60% of case patients and 18% of controls. Symptomatic respiratory infections positive for at least one virus were associated with asthma exacerbations, while asymptomatic infections were not.",

An increase in asthma hospitalizations during early autumn has been noted in several countries, and respiratory viruses, in particular rhinovirus, have been speculated as causative agents [24], [90], [100], [101], [102]. Johnston and colleagues [96] investigated the etiology of the \u201cSeptember epidemic of asthma exacerbations\u201d in a case group of 57 Canadian children with asthma who presented to the emergency department during the last 3 weeks of September compared with a group of 157 controls with asthma recruited from the community. Although the control group did not have an emergency department visit, a majority reported asthma symptoms, including continuous or repeated breathing trouble, waking at night, and activity limitations. Viruses were detected in a significantly larger proportion of the children presenting to the emergency department than children who did not present to the emergency department (62% versus 41%). Cases were also less likely than controls to have been prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid. In a separate study, Johnston and colleagues [103] used a mathematical model to investigate the relationship between peak asthma hospitalizations in Canada and the return to school. The investigators found that over the 13 study years, the average timing of the peak of asthma hospitalizations in school-age children occurred 17.7 days following the return to school, with later peaks for preschool children and adults. The investigators concluded that school-age children were the likely source of the etiologic agent resulting in the yearly peak in asthma hospitalizations, with a plausible hypothesis being transmission of such infectious agents as rhinovirus.",

During the acute exacerbation, 52% of the overall samples were positive, including 59% of the near-fatal asthma and 41% of the acute exacerbations. In the near-fatal asthma group, 47% of the viruses detected were picornavirus and 24% were adenovirus. Viral detection was positive in 7% of the 29 specimens collected 4 to 6 weeks after hospital admission [107].",

Williams and colleagues [108] determined the prevalence of hMPV in a cohort of 101 adults at initial enrollment during an asthma hospitalization (1999\u20132003) and at follow-up 3 months later. HMPV was detected in 6.9% of subjects at admission compared with 1.3% in follow-up. Furthermore, none of the subjects positive for hMPV at admission were positive at follow-up [108]. Another study involving this cohort of patients described the prevalence of rhinovirus in patients during an acute asthma exacerbation and 3-month follow-up [109]. Over the 4-year study period, 21% of the cohort was rhinovirus-positive by PCR during the asthma exacerbation. Seventy-six of the 101 participants completed the 3-month follow-up. At follow-up, only 1.3% (1 patient) were positive and none of the subjects who were rhinovirus-positive during the preceding asthma exacerbation were positive at follow-up. Subjects who were rhinovirus-positive were more likely to smoke cigarettes and be nonusers of inhaled corticosteroids compared with rhinovirus-negative subjects, similar to the findings of lower use of inhaled corticosteroids among children seen in the hospital during the September asthma epidemic associated with rhinovirus [96], [109].",

Subjects maintained diaries of severity of upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms and nasal aspirates were obtained from subjects every 2 weeks. Overall, there were no differences in rhinovirus positivity between the subjects with and without asthma. However, the investigators found that participants with asthma had more frequent clinical LRTIs associated with rhinovirus than did controls (43% versus 17%, respectively). In addition, the group of patients with asthma had significantly higher severity scores (median 1 versus 0) and longer duration of illness (median 2.5 days versus 0 days) [110].",

Viruses are the most important cause of LRTIs in infancy and early childhood, and LRTIs with respiratory viral pathogens have been identified as significant risk factors for the development of early childhood asthma. RSV is an important pathogen in wheezing illnesses during infancy and appears to become less commonly associated with wheezing illnesses in older children. The newly appreciated role of non-RSV LRTI and the strong association of rhinovirus illness with a marked increased risk of future wheezing among children born to a parent with asthma suggest a differential \u201casthmagenicity\u201d of respiratory viruses in asthma pathogenesis. Although it is unclear whether respiratory viruses induce asthma development, children with severe infections during infancy are at increased risk of subsequent wheezing, and large longitudinal studies will, it is hoped, help answer this critical question. Knowing whether respiratory viruses cause asthma presents the hope for a new strategy for asthma prevention. In addition, viruses, implicated in the vast majority of significant disease exacerbations, are important triggers of asthma exacerbations in children and adults, and respiratory viral illness prevention would likely decrease the significant morbidity related to this common chronic disease.",
