However, as measures continue to be imposed and are gradually prolonged, medium and long-term secondary damage caused through isolation must be considered in the risk assessment. Most states discuss the ongoing implementation of shielding measures for high-risk groups such as the elderly even after the end of the current regulations. In this context, we face a particular challenge, since elderly people do not only belong to the SARS-CoV-2 risk group, but also to those who suffer increased morbidity and mortality as a result of the withdrawal of social interaction and mental stimulation. It is, of course, major priority to identify and protect from immediate and acute threats -but as the COVID-19 situation progresses, additional attention should be paid to the secondary damage resulting from the measures.",

Additionally, it is well known that social exclusion is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment, which, in turn, increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and accelerates disease progression of existing conditions [5] . Emotional distress, which is likely to be provoked by the current situation, is another risk factor for premature death, since anxiety is known to predict all-cause death and is especially detrimental in persons aged 75 and older [6, 7] . Besides the psychological burden of isolation, the reduced opportunities for physical activity represent an additional health-damaging burden in the long run. This, of course, applies not only to home residents, but also to elderly people living alone. Eventually, the impoverished environment and lack of regular social, cognitive and sensorimotor stimulation of isolated people may therefore lead to severe conditions and premature death in the elderly. The sad climax of isolation is the lonely dying and the impossibility of an accompanied, palliative situation -a human as well as medical-ethical debacle.",

In addition, and without entering into the depths of an ethical-philosophical debate, the autonomy and notions of quality of life of individuals must be considered. It must be assumed that for many of those affected, an isolated and lonely existence in the last phase of life is not a desirable condition. It should therefore be ensured that, with continuing isolation and increasingly better available testing resources and protective equipment, regular monitoring of the infection status allows individual adjustment of the isolation: Healthy residents should have the opportunity to be visited by their (healthy) relatives in compliance with hygiene regulations and precautionary measures. They should be allowed to leave their room, for example to go for a walk in the garden. In order to be able to retain hygienic standards, the flow of visitors must certainly be reduced and \"visit plans\" may be introduced. Coordination and scheduling should be the responsibility of the nursing homes. Special attention should be paid to the dying: People in institutions have the right to a dignified death and palliative care, even in isolation. With adequate hygienic measures taken, healthy relatives should be admitted to the dying as they should be enabled to accompany the dying process.",
