Once these vaccines were introduced into routine vaccination programs in the USA the annual morbidity of many vaccine-preventable diseases dramatically decreased (Table 90.1\n). In many instances, the disease burden from several vaccine-preventable diseases of childhood has been reduced by over 99% since vaccine introduction (e.g., diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, and polio). The somewhat lower rate of decline of pertussis (the annual morbidity of which has been reduced by a nonetheless impressive 86%) relates to the limited duration of vaccine-induced immunity, which is estimated to wane within 5\u201310 years after childhood vaccination. It is anticipated that recent availability of pertussis booster vaccines for use in adolescents and adults will lead to significant further declines in pertussis morbidity. Even for diseases targeted by vaccines that have been in widespread use for less time, impressive decreases in disease morbidity have been seen (e.g., varicella, hepatitis A, pneumococcal and rotavirus diseases). In a notable recent demonstration of the population benefits of vaccines, introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) resulted in a decrease of 94% in rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children under 5 years of age within the first 7 years of its introduction, with infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae also falling dramatically in this age group.7 In a striking related finding illustrating how vaccines can impact pathogen transmission dynamics, IPD rates also decreased significantly in non-vaccinated children, as well as in individuals over the age of 65 who had not received the vaccine. Thus, direct protection by vaccination of children who represent a reservoir of infection provided, via herd immunity, significant indirect benefits to those who did not themselves receive the vaccine. In another manifestation of the impact of vaccination on the dynamics of pathogen transmission, rates of IPD caused by serotypes not included in PCV-7 (especially 19A) have increased, but remain low compared to the decreases in PCV-7-type IPD. To address this dynamic and provide even broader protection against pneumococcal disease, vaccines of higher valency (10-valent and 13-valent PCVs) have been introduced recently.",

Evaluation in the USA of the impact of ten vaccines routinely given as part of the childhood immunization schedule (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib), polio; measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B and varicella) found that more than 20 million cases of disease and more than 42 000 deaths were averted over the lifetime of the immunized birth cohort of children. When the cost of the vaccination program was compared to the economic impact of diseases prevented, these vaccines alone are estimated to save nearly $14 billion each year. When including indirect economic benefits (such as the time parents take off from work to care for sick children), the annual savings to society exceed $69 billion. When 30 preventive services were ranked based on clinically preventable disease burden and cost-effectiveness, childhood immunization received the highest score.8\n",

Thus, the number of diseases that can be prevented by vaccines included in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) routine childhood and adolescent immunization schedules grew from 7 in 1985 to 16 by 2007 (Table 90.2\nand Appendix A5, and see http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/default.htm). While expanded recommendations for some of these vaccines in children and adolescents have been introduced since 2007 (such as broader use of the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4), and the recommendation for routine use of the quadrivalent human papilloma virus vaccine (HPV4) in males), the number of targeted diseases remains constant for these age groups as of 2012. Moreover, in the past several years, new vaccines have been introduced for adolescents and young adults (e.g., pertussis booster (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines), and older adults (e.g., Tdap and zoster vaccines) have shown that the value of vaccines extends across the human lifespan. New combination vaccines have been developed to increase the simplicity and acceptability of vaccination regimens, as well as to improve overall compliance with the recommended series of vaccines. Such combinations include either those that contain multiple inactivated or recombinant antigens (such as a combination diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Hib, and hepatitis B vaccine) or multiple live attenuated viruses (such as a combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV)). The development of a combination vaccine is often more complicated than simply combining individual antigens, for when antigens are administered in combination, immunologic interference is sometimes seen. This necessitates titration of antigen combinations (and in the case of combinations of inactivated and/or recombinant antigens, adjuvant selection) to achieve immune responses that are not inferior to each of the antigens administered individually.",

The efficacy of many live attenuated vaccines likely reflects the ability of the attenuated vaccine to replicate within vaccinated hosts, and to expose the immune system to pathogen-derived antigens in a manner that closely resembles the nature, location, and effects of natural infection. Because live attenuated vaccines replicate within vaccinated individuals, they can induce both cellular (CD4 and CD8) and humoral (B cell) effector responses and immunologic memory. In addition, as the live attenuated vaccines likely activate the host innate system in a manner similar to their pathogenic parents, they provide inherent adjuvant effects in augmenting adaptive immune responses.",

As such, an effective but also safe and well-tolerated vaccine needs to strike a specific balance between level of attenuation and level of immunogenicity. In addition, depending on the nature and number of genetic mutations responsible for the attenuated phenotype, a potential risk of reversion to a pathogenic form exists for certain vaccines. For most live attenuated vaccines, this has not been observed to be a problem in clinical practice\u2014likely because the attenuating mutations are sufficiently numerous or genetically stable. One vaccine where reversion to pathogenic form was seen involved specific components of the live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV; the \u201cSabin vaccine\u201d). In this instance, vaccine reversion to wild-type was shown to lead rarely to cases of paralytic polio (approximately one case per million doses administered).17 Based on these observations and the elimination of endogenous polio transmission in many developed countries, the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV; the \u201cSalk vaccine\u201d) was substituted for OPV. However, in light of a favorable cost\u2013benefit ratio, high degree of efficacy, and ease of administration, OPV continues to be the mainstay of polio vaccination efforts in developing countries. Yet, should efforts to eradicate polio continue to advance, new solutions for polio vaccination will need to be developed that do not depend on currently available OPV (which can revert to pathogenic form at low frequency) or IPV (which is produced by inactivation of pathogenic polioviruses strains that will require high levels of biocontainment in a post-eradication environment) vaccines.",

While this approach has the benefit of presenting most of a pathogen's antigenic repertoire to the immune system of the immunized host, it can only be used in instances where the inactivated pathogen does not possess constituents that would confer significant toxicity. Vaccines based on killed pathogens are believed to exert their protective effects via elicitation of pathogen-neutralizing antibodies and the induction of memory B-cell responses (likely in concert with CD4 T-cell memory). However, because inactivated pathogens cannot accomplish de novo synthesis of pathogen-derived gene products in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), they do not typically induce CD8 T-cell responses (Chapter 6). In addition, killed vaccines are generally less immunogenic than live attenuated vaccines. As a result, they are commonly administered with an adjuvant (most often aluminium salts: see section on Adjuvants, below) to augment their immunogenicity. A number of viral and bacterial vaccines currently in use are killed/inactivated vaccines, including whole-cell Bordetella pertussis vaccine and the influenza virus, rabies virus, and hepatitis A virus vaccines.",

Although such purified polysaccharides can induce protective levels of antibody responses in adults, they are poorly immunogenic in children under 2 years of age (as a function of the relative immaturity of their immune systems). In addition, T-independent antibody responses elicited by purified capsular polysaccharides are less durable than those that are produced in the presence of CD4 T-cell help. As a means of both augmenting antibody responses against polysaccharide antigens in young children and facilitating their persistence, the development of conjugate vaccines represented an important advance.21 In this approach, purified polysaccharides are chemically conjugated to a carrier protein (such as diphtheria toxoid or an outer-membrane protein complex (OMPC) derived from N. meningitidis). The carrier protein augments CD4 T-cell helper responses to the polysaccharide antigens, and enables elicitation of durable protective antibody responses even in young children. Polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines have been produced that protect against Haemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and N. meningitidis infections.",

If so, does the pathogen cause such a life-threatening disease that an attenuated version of the virus would face an impossible barrier for demonstration of safety?\u25aaCan a specific antigen (or antigens) be identified that represents the target of protective host immune responses?\u25aaIf the protective immune response is mediated by antibodies, can the target antigen be produced in scalable quantities in a form that mimics its native structure so that it can effectively elicit antibody responses that can block the key functional role(s) of the target molecule in the pathogen or otherwise lead to pathogen clearance?\u25aaHaving chosen an antigen and presentation system, what is the best way to produce it on a large scale?\u25aaWhat is the most effective way to present the antigens of the pathogen of interest to the immune system?\u25aaIs the antigen of interest sufficiently immunogenic on its own, or is augmentation of the desired immune response by conjugation to a specific carrier or addition of an adjuvant necessary for vaccination?\u25aaWhat potential safety concerns can be anticipated for the vaccine in question?\u25aaWhat is the attack rate of the infection in the general population? If the infection occurs relatively rarely in an overall population, can a subset of the population be identified that has a higher risk of infection so as to accelerate the achievement of statistically significant protection?\u25aaWhat tests to evaluate vaccine immunogenicity will need to be carried out on clinical samples obtained from participants in the clinical trials? Will measurement of antibody titers, T-cell responses, pathogen presence and quantity, pathogen serotype, and any other parameter peculiar to the disease in question represent the primary criteria for vaccine effect?

However, to demonstrate that these alternative rotavirus vaccines were safe, and that an increased risk of intussusception was not inherent to rotavirus vaccines as a class, very large-scale safety studies were required. Toward this end, the safety of each of these vaccines was evaluated in studies involving about 70 000 infants\u2014just to evaluate whether the rate of intussusception in vaccinees was discernibly increased compared to the normal background rates seen in the placebo recipients.11,\n12 Fortunately, both vaccines were found to be well tolerated and no increase in intussusception was observed in vaccine as compared to placebo recipients. In light of the documented efficacy of these vaccines determined in earlier and significantly smaller phase III trials, both have now been licensed in a number of countries. However, even with the large phase III studies conducted for these newer rotavirus vaccines, they have been and continue to be studied in large postlicensure active surveillance safety studies and closely monitored in active and passive vaccine safety surveillance systems (see below).",

However, a number of other safety concerns that have emerged are not supported by scientific evidence.35 An example of this can be found in the case of concerns about the association of whole-cell pertussis vaccines with permanent brain damage\u2014concerns that were later shown to be unfounded. Nevertheless, public concerns about the safety of the whole-cell pertussis vaccine resulted in decreased levels of pertussis vaccination coverage that were soon followed by epidemics of whooping cough in the UK and Japan.36 Another example is the allegation that certain vaccines, such as the combination measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, are associated with autism. Highlighting how perceptions of temporal association can give rise to public concerns, MMR vaccines are generally given around 1 year of age, and autism is generally diagnosed in the second year of life. Although the alleged causal association between MMR and autism has been refuted by multiple extensive scientific analyses, reports in the popular media in the UK resulted in a dramatic drop in vaccination rates, followed by an increased rate of new infections.37,\n38 The original publication in The Lancet was subsequently disavowed by the majority of the manuscript's authors39 and then formally retracted by The Lancet's editors as a result of factual misrepresentations and ethical violations.40,\n41 While the purported association between MMR and autism has now been thoroughly discredited, this claim resulted in decreased MMR vaccination rates in a number of countries as a result of some parents delaying or refusing measles vaccination. With an increase in the number of geographic clusters of unvaccinated children, rates of endemic measles infections have recently increased in several countries in Europe (with a spill-over effect of nearly all of the rare cases of measles reported in the USA having originated from US travelers visiting endemic countries or immigrants from them).",

Current research and development efforts are focusing on the derivation of flu vaccine approaches that would have much greater speed and reliability of production soon after recognition of emergence of a new strain; that would be more readily produced at a scale to enable global access; that would engender increased breadth of coverage to protect against diverse influenza strains; and that would be more immunogenic and efficacious in vulnerable populations (such as the elderly) who often respond poorly to currently available vaccines. In addition to efforts to develop novel influenza vaccines, efforts to increase the immunogenicity of the flu vaccines in populations that typically respond poorly (including the elderly) and to accomplish dose-sparing benefits (that would be useful in pandemic settings where vaccine supply is limited) via the use of novel adjuvants or alternative delivery approaches (such as intradermal administration) are being actively explored.",

Shortly thereafter, the original approach to influenza vaccine production was developed that involved chemical inactivation of the virus with formalin, followed by its disruption with detergent\u2013yielding non-infectious, but immunogenic viral fragments. Most of the currently deployed influenza vaccines continue to be manufactured according to this 60\u201370 year old process. More recently, based on the recognition that influenza virus also grows well in certain cultivated mammalian cells, some vaccine manufacturers are looking toward this somewhat more controlled method for producing virus that can then be inactivated by the traditional methods above.",

Yet, HIV infection represents a vexing challenge to vaccine development.55,\n56 HIV establishes a chronic, persistent infection that cannot be cleared by host immune responses. Following infection of target cells, the genome of HIV\u2014a retrovirus\u2014is transcribed into a DNA copy via the action of reverse transcriptase. The newly formed DNA copy of the HIV genome then integrates into the host cell chromosomes (referred to as a provirus) as a requisite step in the viral lifecycle. Once integrated into the chromosome of an infected cell, the HIV provirus can alternatively be actively transcribed, leading to the synthesis of viral mRNAs and subsequently to production of new virus particles, or it can remain in a transcriptionally silent, functionally latent state in a small percentage of infected cells. As infected cells harboring latent HIV proviruses do not produce HIV protein antigens, they cannot be recognized by host antiviral immune responses and can thereby persist undetected. Upon subsequent activation of latently infected cells at some later time, viral RNA transcription can be coincidently activated leading to production of progeny virions.",

As a result of these influences, genetically diverse populations of HIV variants are established in infected persons that facilitate the outgrowth of genetic variants that can escape from selective pressures\u2014be they effective host cellular or humoral immune responses, or the inhibitory effects of antiretroviral drugs.57 An extraordinary degree of genetic diversity is also manifest in the HIV variants seen in different individuals and in different geographic regions.

It was hypothesized that induction of high levels of HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses prior to infection may not prevent infection, but may enable infected individuals to control virus replication better. Should this hypothesis be valid, individuals immunized with such vaccines may exhibit lower levels of ongoing HIV replication, progress to AIDS more slowly, and potentially be less likely to transmit HIV infection to others. Much of this work targeting elicitation of CD8 T cell responses against HIV involves vectored gene delivery systems (such as adenoviral vectors, described below). However, the results of the first phase IIb \u201ctest of concept study\u201d59 (The Step Study) to examine this hypothesis failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on either prevention of infection or reduction of viral load among volunteers who received the vaccine despite the induction of appreciable levels of HIV-specific CTL responses by the recombinant adenovirus-based (Ad5) vaccine employed (and was accompanied by a suggestion of increased risk of HIV acquisition in uncircumcised men with evidence of prior Ad5 infection). While this study result does not, in and of itself, refute the \u201cCTL hypothesis\u201d, it represented a significant disappointment for the AIDS vaccine research effort, and raised important questions about the ability of vaccine-elicited cell mediated immune responses to favorably alter the outcome of HIV infection.60\n",

In addition to direct morbidity and mortality, malaria is responsible for debilitating illness with enormous social and economic consequences. Of the four malaria-associated protozoal species, Plasmodium flaciparum and P. vivax represent the two major agents. These parasites have a three-stage lifecycle taking place both within the mosquito, and in the liver and blood of the infected host, and each cycle is largely distinct from the others from an immunological perspective. As a result of the multiple strategies for evasion of host immune response that the parasite has evolved, parasite replication proceeds at high levels despite active host immune responses.67,\n68 Either as a result of these specific immune evasion strategies or the inability of the infected human host to mount immune responses that clear the parasite, prior infection does not protect an individual from repeated subsequent infections. Although the severity of disease is often attenuated following repeated infection, the mechanism of disease modulation is incompletely understood, and the limited relative immunity engendered by prior infection is easily lost if an individual leaves a malaria-endemic region. As such, the limited impact and duration of host immune responses to malaria parasites suggest that any successful vaccine strategy will need to do far better than natural immune responses\u2014a high bar for efforts to develop an effective vaccine.",

A number of these antigens are being explored, often delivered by viral vectors, as ways of boosting the protective efficacy of BCG in individuals who have previously been vaccinated with BCG. The results of one such \u201cproof of concept\u201d study of a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector encoding the M. tuberculosis antigen 85A as a booster immunization in infants who had received the BCG vaccine are slated to be available in late 2012. An alternative vaccine strategy is based on improving the performance of the BCG vaccine by insertion of genes encoding specific potential protective antigens that it normally lacks. In addition, the development of auxotrophic mutants of M. tuberculosis is being explored as a potential immunogenic and specifically attenuated live vaccine. The determination of the sequence of the M. tuberculosis genome nearly a decade ago helped identify numerous previously unknown gene products, and increased the repertoire of antigens to be evaluated for their ability to induce protective immune responses.80 The pathogen sequence is also being used to elucidate virulence determinants and thereby help guide efforts to attenuate M. tuberculosis rationally.",

A variety of influenza vaccines are licensed for pediatric use, but vaccines to prevent infection with the paromyxoviruses RSV and PIV remain elusive. A significant impediment to vaccine development for RSV and PIV traces back to unanticipated untoward results obtained in clinical studies of inactivated RSV vaccines in the early 1960s.81 These early-generation RSV vaccines\u2014based on cultured virus that had been inactivated with formalin\u2014raised a potent antibody response in immunized children. However, on subsequent natural exposure to RSV, vaccine recipients exhibited more frequent and significantly more severe lower respiratory tract RSV infections than did unimmunized children. As a similar phenomenon was also seen with a formalin-inactivated measles vaccine in the same era, a common immunopathologic mechanism may be operative.82 While the mechanism of exacerbation of RSV disease by the early inactivated vaccines is incompletely understood, it has been suggested that chemical inactivation of RSV and measles virus resulted in modification of a critical neutralizing structure on the surfaces of these viruses, thereby limiting the induction of the most potent neutralizing antibodies and favoring nonneutralizing and potentially immunopathologic antibody responses. (Passive protection against RSV is available for premature infants in the form of monoclonal antibodies that target the RSV F protein (one of the viral envelope glycoproteins); as such, certain anti-RSV antibody responses can clearly mediate protective as opposed to deleterious effects.70) Alternatively, or in addition, it has been proposed that inactivated RSV vaccines may have preferentially induced a Th2-type immune response when a Th1-type response may be needed to effect protection of the lower respiratory tract from RSV infection and damage.",

Current work to develop a Men B vaccine centers on a handful of relatively well-conserved surface proteins of meningococcus.86,\n87 Many of these antigens have been identified by \u201creverse vaccinology\u201d, and indeed, a Men B vaccine candidate currently in the late stages of clinical testing may prove to be the first vaccine to be licensed that was discovered using reverse vaccinology methods (see section on antigen discovery).

In addition, like other herpes viruses, HSV encodes a number of gene products that promote evasion of host immune responses (Chapter 27). Recent attempts to make HSV-2 vaccines have used virus glycoproteins (particularly HSV-2 glycoprotein D [gD]) produced by recombinant DNA methods. An earlier clinical efficacy trial of this approach showed partial protection of women, but not men, who were seronegative for HSV1.93 The reasons for this curious result are not clear. However, the results of a subsequent clinical trial of an adjuvanted HSV-2 gD vaccine recently demonstrated the inability of the vaccine to protect women from HSV-2 infection or disease, in contrast to the earlier results (although modest protection [35% efficacy] was reported against HSV-1 infection).94 In addition to recombinant gD-based approaches, a number of preclinical studies are exploring the ability of cell-mediated immune responses to HSV antigens induced by recombinant vaccine vectors (e.g., adenoviruses: see novel vaccine vectors, below) to prevent or ameliorate HSV infections.

Adsorption of antigens on to alum routinely improves immunogenicity, particularly the antibody response. Alum does not typically enhance CD8 T-cell responses.

While DNA vaccines have been generally well tolerated in immunized volunteers, in most human studies of DNA vaccines to date, administration of even substantial quantities of DNA vaccine vectors has elicited relatively low-level immune responses. It is not yet known whether these disappointing results reflects fundamental differences in the immunogenic behavior of DNA vaccines in humans and mice, or the fact that the DNA doses administered to humans do not match those administered to mice (DNA per weight of the immunized host). As such, a variety of approaches are being explored to prolong DNA survival in tissue, promote more efficient targeting of DNA to APCs, or to develop novel adjuvants that might specifically amplify immune responses to DNA vaccines.145,\n146 In addition, novel DNA delivery approaches, such as in situ electroporation, have shown promise in increasing DNA vaccine immunogenicity in early clinical studies in humans.147\n",

The term \u201creverse genetics\u201d refers to the use of recombinant DNA methods to generate infectious viruses possessing genomes derived from cloned cDNAs. Such cDNAs can be modified to study the impact of specific genetic modifications to viral phenotype, providing a new approach for the generation of live attenuated vaccines via either introduction of targeted mutations or, in the case of segmented viruses, the preparation of vaccines via genetic reassortment (see Fig. 90.4). Reverse genetic methods provide promising tools for the study and defined manipulation of both nonsegmented and segmented negative-strand RNA viruses (such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses, respectively). The use of reverse genetic strategies to generate infectious viral progeny from cloned cDNAs is shown above. Influenza virus genomes are comprised of eight single-stranded (negative-sense) RNA segments. Initiation of influenza virus RNA (vRNA) transcription from negative-sense genomic RNAs, and the replication of the virus genome, depends on the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex (which includes viral RNA, the nucleoprotein (NP) and three polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA)). To generate infectious influenza virus from cDNAs of the vRNA genome segments, cells are cotransfected with all eight segments of vRNA under the control of RNA polymerase promoters. Cellular polymerase I (pol 1) synthesizes vRNAs that are then replicated and transcribed by the viral polymerase and NP proteins that comprise the RNP complex. Reverse genetics strategies are expected to facilitate the generation of novel flu vaccines by enabling preparation of well-defined vaccine preparations comprised of donor \u201cbackbone\u201d viral segments (see Fig. 90.4) that harbor specific attenuating mutations with vRNA segments encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins obtained via reverse transcription of vRNA genes from circulating viruses (including those prepared from pandemic strains that may be difficult and/or unsafe to propagate in large manufacturing scale).",

            "text": "Fig. 90.2: New vaccine strategies: genetic reassortment approaches. Viruses with segmented genomes provide a new approach for the generation of attenuated vaccines via Mendelian genetic reassortment. If two such segmented viruses with different genetic characteristics are used to infect one cell, the progeny viruses from this mixed infection will carry a range of mixtures of the genes of the two parent viruses. Using either genetic or immunologic screening methods, reassorted viruses carrying the precise gene composition of interest can be selected. This approach has recently been employed to generate live attenuated vaccines against rotavirus and influenza virus. The strategy for generation of the pentavalent bovine\u2013human reassortment rotavirus vaccine is shown above. Rotaviruses have a segmented double-stranded RNA genome comprising 11 independent RNA elements. The outer shell of the virus comprises two proteins VP4 and VP7 that are involved in cell binding and entry and that specify the viral serotype (P type for VP4 and G type for VP7). VP4 and VP7 also represent the targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies. The pentavalent bovine\u2013human rotavirus vaccine was generated by a \u201cmodified Jennerian\u201d approach in which the bovine rotavirus WC3 (which is attenuated in humans as a result of host range restriction) serves as the gene donor for the backbone on to which gene segments encoding four common human rotavirus G types (G1\u20134) as well as one very common P type (P8) (derived from individual rotavirus isolates) were reassorted via a process of cell co-infection and subsequent selection of the recombinant viruses with the desired composition of bovine and human gene segments. An analogous genetic reassortment approach has also been used to generate live attenuated influenza vaccines. In this instance, three attenuated \u201ccold-adapted\u201d viral strains (two A types and one type B) are used in co-infections in tissue culture with recent circulating wild-type influenza strains to derive vaccine strains that include the two relevant hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)-encoding gene segments admixed with the six \u201cbackbone\u201d genes from the attenuated master donor virus for use in annual influenza vaccines.",

In specific instances, VLPs can be produced via a process of self-assembly of individual viral capsid proteins produced by recombinant DNA methods in cell culture systems. This approach has a number of attractive aspects, including the ability to produce VLPs that accurately display conformationally correct epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies and the absence of pathogen-derived nucleic acids. In addition, recombinant VLPs have been employed to derive safe and effective vaccines for pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV), that cannot be grown in culture (and are thus refractory to standard vaccine approaches of attenuation or inactivation). The generation of the VLPs that comprises newly developed HPV vaccines is shown. The HPV L1 proteins (which represent the major capsid protein and target of virus-neutralizing, protective antibodies), derived from HPV types of interest (e.g., types 16, 18, 6, and 11) are produced via recombinant methods. Under appropriate conditions, individual bioengineered L1 proteins first self-assemble into pentamers, and then into VLPs that are comprised of 72 pentamers and that are almost identical, both morphologically and antigenically, to infectious HPV virus particles. VLPs prepared from individual HPV types are then combined with specific adjuvants to prepare the final vaccine products.",

Individual genes are analyzed for the presence of putative structures that should be present on the surface of the bacterium (membrane anchors, certain types of secretion signals, etc) that could be vaccine targets (upper two drawings). In many cases, these initial candidate genes will be re-scanned against the genomes of alternate isolates of the same species in order to identify conserved surface antigens. Candidate genes that satisfy these criteria are then expressed as recombinant proteins that are then used to vaccinate animals. Antigens that raise the desired immune response are taken forward for further development. In parallel, a proteomic exercise may be carried out to confirm the presence of a selection of antigens on the surface of the bacterium, preferably taken from a patient sample with minimal in vitro culturing (lower two drawings). The bacterium is treated with a protease mixture that cleaves off surface proteins. The cleavage products are collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The cleavage products are broken down to small peptides as part of the spectrometry process, and their sequences are imputed from their molecular weights compared against the predicted sequences from the genome. This extra proteomics step can reduce the number of candidates to be screened in more expensive animal studies.",

The targeted activation of specific dendritic cell (DC) populations via engagement of specific TLRs to initiate innate and adaptive immune responses represents a very promising approach for the development of novel adjuvants based on natural or synthetic versions of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that trigger specific TLRs. Specific TLRs and their natural activating ligands are shown above. Different TLRs are associated with different adaptor proteins that propagate intracellular signaling along distinct pathways which favor specific immune responses (e.g., Th1, Th2, cross-presentation or CTL priming). The character of responses from specific TLR engagement illustrated is based on animal and ex vivo studies. In humans, TLRs 7 and 9 are expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/phagolysosomes of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) that represent the major sources of type I interferon production (e.g., IFN-\u03b1). Human myeloid DCs (mDCs) express TLR3 (in the ER/phagolysosomes); and TLR2 (heterodimerized with TLRs 1 or 6), and TLRs 4, 5, 8, and 11 on the cell surface.",
