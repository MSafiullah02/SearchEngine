            "text": "Turbulent flow simulations in infinitely spanning homogeneous porous media have revealed a directional deviation of momentum from the principal plane of symmetry. The temporal progression of symmetry breakdown is effectuated through the amplification of a microscopic imbalance that arises from the emergence of a von Karman instability. Several geometric criteria determine the occurrence of symmetry breaking, but the parameters that control it are limited to the momentum supply and the magnitude of confinement. The phenomenon suggests a strong dependence of the macroscopic field variables on the interaction between microscopic vortices. In practice, macroscopic amplification of microscopic instability provides a platform for enhanced fluid mixing in porous media and a source for macroscopic instabilities that are larger in size than the pore scale. This discovery draws its roots from a quest to study the suppression of turbulent structures within a porous medium with low porosity (the porosity is denoted by \u03c6 in this work). The diameter of the solid obstacles d, or the pore size s (obstacle array spacing distance) are used in practice to describe the characteristic length scale of the microscopic flow, neither of which can adequately describe the variation in the size of the turbulent structures with porosity. Having observed that the turbulent length scale suppression in porous media is, in fact, quite significant Uth et al. 2016) , examination of the associated flow field revealed that the flow deviates significantly from the principal direction in which the driving force (momentum source) is applied when the porosity is low. The deviatory flow has also been observed by other researchers in the context of heat exchangers (Iacovides et al. 2013) . It is worthwhile to understand the mechanics of this phenomenon due to the abundance of porous media with low porosity throughout various applications (Nield & Bejan 2017) .",

Modeling macroscopic flow in porous media is, in essence, a lumped parameter method with the added complexity of non-linearity. Although sufficiently accurate macroscopic models are available (de Lemos 2006) , the sheer versatility of applications invalidates several models. For instance, when simulating turbulence in porous media, the closure models for the fluctuating macroscopic terms still require development . Modeling symmetry breaking in the turbulent flow regime in flows with low porosity requires careful consideration, since the phenomenon is strongly dependent on geometry and boundary conditions. The mechanism by which the microscopic events are transferred to the macroscopic variables, which would result in macroscopic symmetry breaking, is dependent on a range of parameters, some of which are identified in this work. To understand the interplay between microscopic and macroscopic variables, a comprehensive momentum budget is required in future work.",

The advent of High Performance Computing has facilitated high-resolution studies using numerical simulations. These studies have enabled resourceful extraction of the intricate details that are associated with the microscopic scales of turbulent flow. However, the simulations are still subject to reasonable, yet unnatural simplifications. One such simplification that is utilized here is the abstraction of a porous medium as a periodic domain with a uniform arrangement of solid obstacles, called the Generic Porous Matrix (GPM). The GPMs used in this work are two dimensional, deriving from the fact that the voids are distributed in a single plane and are extruded in the plane normal direction.",

The size of the REV-T is determined based on the expected size of the largest turbulent eddies, which is smaller than four times the pore size, 4s (Uth et al. 2016) . The two-dimensional nature of the GPM allows for smaller domain bounds (2s) in the 2-D plane-normal direction. Even though the flow features for a 2-D GPM are three-dimensional, their influence in the plane-normal direction is small. It should be noted that several researchers have successfully utilized smaller domains for turbulence simulations in porous media (Iacovides et al. 2013; Kuwahara et al. 2006 ).",

The Reynolds number that is chosen for the LES and RANS cases in this work is 10,000, which is well within the fully turbulent flow regime where the effect of transitional flow is absent (Seguin et al. 1998) . Simulations are also performed for a range of Reynolds numbers, starting from a laminar condition to a fully turbulent condition. After verifying the occurrence of the phenomenon at a low Reynolds number of 500, a DNS validation is performed for a Pore Scale Reynolds number specification of 1,000. It is established that the error in measurement of macroscopic flow angle in LES is ~1.3% (contrasted with DNS for \u03c6 = 0.5). The simulations are performed with the commercial CFD solver ANSYS Fluent 16.0 on the North Carolina State University Linux cluster utilizing between 80 -200 Intel Xeon Processors in parallel. The number of grid points vary between 8,000,000 -15,000,000 cells for the LES and RANS cases, as the geometry is adjusted for increasing porosity. The DNS case requires 90,000,000 cells for an adequate resolution at the chosen Reynolds number. The simulations take between 20,000 -40,000 CPU-Hours (Computation Time in Hours for a single CPU).",

The most striking observation from figure 2 is that a macroscopic flow angle (\u2329 \u232a , defined in this work as the angle between the macroscopic velocity vector and the momentum source vector) is present that is dependent on porosity, a parameter that measures the extent of confinement induced by the solid obstacles. There exists a regime of flow with regard to porosity (\u03c6 > 0.95) where the flow pattern surrounding a GPM obstacle behaves independent of other obstacles in the medium. True independence is virtually impossible. However, the interaction between the wake behind an obstacle and the surface of the streamwise adjacent obstacle is weak and the wake interaction between transverse adjacent obstacles is non-existent. Note that the streamwise adjacent obstacles are located along the principal direction while the transverse adjacent obstacles are located normal to the principal direction, above the streamwise adjacent obstacle. Weak wake interaction would result in the flow possessing characteristics that are typically observed in external flows. When the porosity is reduced (0.8 < \u03c6 < 0.95), a strong interaction exists between streamwise adjacent obstacles with the wake from one obstacle impinging on the wall of the streamwise adjacent obstacle.",

The decisive factor for each scenario is determined by the ability of the flow to remain attached to the surface of the obstacle. Our simulation results suggest that this ability is directly derived from the availability of momentum in the proximity of the vortex shedding process, through the pressure force acting on the solid obstacles and the strength of the vortex interaction. In the dire absence of supply of momentum, the flow is forced to separate at a prescribed location while preserving symmetry. The vortex that is associated with this separation point is typically large and would scale with the size of the obstacle. A vortex of this size cannot be transported in a medium that is as constrained. When the size of the shed vortex is comparable to the gap between two obstacles, the vortex cannot maintain its form as it passes through the voids due to the presence of a strong local adverse pressure gradient in the void. In a sense, the vortex would plug the porous medium until it disintegrates. However, this does not happen in practice owing to the massive loss in momentum that would have incurred. Rather, the generated vortex forms a zone of recirculation in between the streamwise adjacent obstacles. The bulk of the flow continues to pass over the recirculation zones since the gap is \"bridged\" by the vortices. The recirculating vortices are slowly and continually dissipated in the shear layer in between the recirculation zone and the bulk flow in the form of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, thereby making room for incoming fluid that enters the recirculation zone after separation.",

The associated Reynolds number of the flow marks the incidence of the von Karman instability which is characterized by a detached vortex system. The vortex shedding process must mutate in a manner that allows for more room for dissipation. A change in the location of the separation point, such that the locations are not symmetric on the obstacle surface, causes a shift in the direction of vortex shedding such that the vortices no longer impinge on the streamwise adjacent obstacle that is in such close proximity. In the case with \u03c6 = 0.72, the gap between adjacent cylinders is sufficiently large, allowing the formation of a vortex on either side of the obstacle symmetry plane. An asymmetry in the location of the separation point tilts the shedding path and allows the vortices to be dissipated in the mean flow. As a result of this shift, it can be observed that the vortices of a pair formed by this procedure are not identical in size. As the porosity is lowered further (\u03c6 \u2264 0.61), the flow remains forcibly attached under the influence of the stagnation pressure for long enough to separate on the same side of the obstacle symmetry plane. Separation on either side of the obstacle symmetry plane is not possible here since the minimum void space is too small to allow the vortex to be transported across it without disintegration. Since vortices propagate in the direction dictated by the separated shear layer, separation on the same side results in the interaction between transverse adjacent obstacles. The wakes of the obstacles in the case of low porosity impinge on the transverse adjacent obstacle rather than the streamwise adjacent obstacle. FIGURE 2.

The periodic arrangement of obstacles is perceived differently by the flow in the case of low porosity. Rather than looking at the arrangement in terms of the obstacles, one must think of the GPM for low porosity as an arrangement of paths for the fluid. The GPM is essentially formed by a network of \"convergingdiverging\" channels that are connected in two directions. This enables a possible explanation for the ability of the flow to remain attached in the converging portion of the channel due to the additional momentum supplied by the favorable pressure gradient, which typically exists in converging geometry. This ability is enhanced as the porosity becomes lower, until a critical value is reached where the two obstacles are close enough that the flow would be forced to trip from the influence of the constriction. To visualize this better, a simulation is performed starting from a constant, symmetric initial solution until the deviatory flow is sustained. The simulation is performed for a Pore Scale Reynolds number (Rep = \u2044 ; where is the filtration velocity, d is the obstacle diameter, and \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity) of 10,000, which is well within the limit of fully turbulent flows (Seguin et al. 1998) , and for a porosity of 0.50, which is not close to any critical value in the governing parameters.",

The von Karman instability can emerge from even the smallest of defects that may be present in the numerical grid or the solution process, allowing the instability to manifest in a manner that breaks symmetry. Since the recirculating vortices are detached from the surface of the obstacle, a second shedding cycle occurs once again in a manner that preserves symmetry. However, this symmetry is shortlived as the newly formed vortex pushes into the recirculation zone causing the recirculating vortices to break down into multiple structures marking the beginning of asymmetry. It is observed that a phase difference in shedding emerges; this is characteristic of the von Karman instability. Consequently, the recirculating vortex system that breaks down does so in an uneven manner such that the structures on the leading phase side dissipate before the structures on the lagging phase side do (see figure 4 ). In all of the simulations shown in figure 2 , the deviatory flow is oriented such that the transverse momentum contribution is along the positive y-direction. It is equally probable that the deviatory flow is oriented along the negative y-direction. The directional preference of the deviatory flow in the y-direction is decided, randomly, by the initial phase difference. FIGURE 3.

It begins to increase at \u0305 = 0.4 (non-dimensional time is used as defined in \u00a73.1.1. ) during the formation of the first vortex pair. The deviation appears to be insignificant, but the emergence of the von Karman instability is dependent on the presence of a minute disturbance in the flow field. Once the first vortex pair reaches the flow incident surface upon detachment, the stagnation pressure increases rapidly, leading to a 10% deviation in favor of the top stagnation point. A key observation that is made in several visualizations is that the flow is first inclined in the opposite direction, before the complete development of asymmetry changes the direction of the macroscopic flow to the positive y-direction. The location of the stagnation point is also symmetric until \u0305 = 1, where the first strong deviation is observed. Once the von Karman vortex mechanism sets in, peaks in deviation, magnitude, and location start to appear. Along with the presence of peaks, the median trend of the deviation also increases until a statistically stable value is reached, which is denoted by the mean deviation. The deviation continues to oscillate about the mean throughout the remainder of the simulation time. The increasing trend is characteristic of the build-up of asymmetry that is irreversible (unless the boundary conditions change). Infinitely periodic domains are conducive to the sustenance of deviation, since an infinite fluid reservoir is available. In the absence of this infinite reservoir (for example, in cases where the porous medium fills the shape of a larger entity immersed in a fluid), such a large deviation (over 100%) may not sustain, but rather the deviation would oscillate about a smaller value.",

The impingement of the vortex pair on the surface of the solid obstacle results in a large magnitude of stagnation pressure that is one order greater than the mean dynamic pressure of the macroscopic flow. The magnitude strength possessed by the stagnation pressure is crucial to its ability to manipulate the macroscopic flow field. Subsequently, peaks in the plot in figure 6(a) occur whenever a vortex is incident on the surface of the solid obstacle. However, the vortex pair develops a phase difference after the first peak leading to temporally localized pressure gradients that develop in magnitude as the vortices interact with each other. The magnitude of the stagnation pressure can be seen to reduce after the initial development stage ( \u0305 > 4). The strength of the vortices that would be shed in the absence of symmetry breaking is clearly demonstrated by the magnitude of the stagnation pressure in the developmental stage, which would incur a much larger loss in the momentum of the flow.

The macroscopic flow angle rises slowly from zero until the porosity is low enough for the vortex size to be constrained by the void space. At this stage, a sharp increase in macroscopic flow angle is observed as the separation point shifts from opposing sides to the same side of the obstacle symmetry plane. A maxima exists close to \u03c6 = 0.61, after which the macroscopic flow angle reduces slowly. This is attributed to the proximity of the obstacle surfaces when using large obstacles. The mean pressure distribution on the flow incident surface of the obstacle is nearly symmetric for the case of \u03c6 = 0.80 (see figure 5 ) resulting in a very small magnitude of macroscopic flow angle. As porosity reduces, asymmetry is observed in the pressure distribution and the ratio of mean stagnation pressure to the mean bulk dynamic pressure increases. This signifies that the angle increases as a consequence of the increased ability of the flow to remain attached, which is derived from a stronger stagnation pressure in a closely packed obstacle arrangement. In the case of \u03c6 = 0.50, a secondary peak is observed which is only a fraction as strong as the stagnation peak. The secondary peak reduces the slope of the pressure distribution which in turn reduces the macroscopic flow angle. It is attributed to the proximity of an obstacle to the stagnation point on its transverse adjacent obstacle. As the porosity is reduced further, this peak pressure is expected to increase. A summary of simulation cases set up to study the dependence of the macroscopic flow field on the porosity is presented in tables 1, 2 and 3.",

The vortices on the bottom (naming convention in figure 8) increase in size as porosity reduces until a critical value of porosity is reached, beyond which the size decreases. The vortex size increases first as a consequence of increasing solid obstacle diameter. The size continues to increase until the generated vortices are too large to be contained in the void volume.

The sudden drop in vortex core diameter for the bottom vortex is an indication of the suppression of the vortex core size in low porosity as a result of the decreasing void volume. On the top side, the vortex core size decreases first as porosity is reduced until a critical value of porosity is reached, which is identical to that of the bottom vortex. This reduction in size is a consequence of the growth of the bottom vortex and the tilt in the shedding path, which together constrains the vortex.

The discontinuity in macroscopic flow angle occurs at a critical value of porosity within the deviatory regime where the hindrance caused by the small void size forces the vortex shedding configuration to change across it.

Turbulence model independence of symmetry breaking has been established using DNS, and it is important to note from the comparison of the macroscopic angle that the phenomenon of symmetry breaking is largely dependent on the large-scale eddies. The RANS simulations agree very well, qualitatively, with the trend predicted by LES. The jump in the macroscopic angle is predicted to be located at the same range of porosity (0.61 < \u03c6 < 0.67). The macroscopic angle increases exponentially at first, reaches a peak value, and then starts to decrease. The peak value of macroscopic angle occurs at a porosity of 0.5 in RANS, rather than at 0.61 as predicted by LES. RANS also predicts a sharp increase in the macroscopic flow angle near \u03c6 = 0.80, resulting in a larger range of porosity that is sensitive for the macroscopic flow angle. For a porosity of 0.61, it is observed that the RANS model predicts flow separation on opposing sides of the plane of symmetry of the solid obstacles, while the vortex is formed on the same side of the symmetry plane. This is an unlikely solution since the converging nature of the void will cause the flow to reattach and it is isolated to be the cause of the discrepancy between the LES and RANS results. The errors introduced by the steady state solver, modelling errors, and the use of wall functions will contribute to a poorer solution near the wall.

While this configuration presents a smooth transitional regime, the constant addition of momentum in the converging section of the void, where the flow is seen to separate in RANS, will cause the flow to reattach. The supply of momentum is aided by the pressure gradient in the void, which has the highest favorable gradient for a porosity of 0.61 amongst all the tested cases. Therefore, the flow is least likely to separate in the converging section for the porosity of 0.61. The LES cases represent the variation of macroscopic flow angle accurately, with a better prediction of the vortex shedding process than in the case of RANS.",

We investigated symmetry-breaking using circular cylindrical obstacles, which gradually changes the behavior of the flow from an attached to separated condition. Simulations were also performed for square cylinders, rotated square cylinders (diamond shape), and spherical obstacles. The use of square cylinders and diamond shaped cylinders did not yield deviatory flow for values of porosity that lie in the deviatory regime. The reason behind this is that both square cylinders and diamond shaped cylinders possess sharp corners that force the flow to separate at that location. In the case of square cylinders, the converging diverging section that is necessary to accelerate the flow is absent as well. For spherical obstacles, the macroscopic flow angle is present, where the flow deviates from the principal direction resulting in a three dimensional flow angle. Symmetry breaking is seen in three different arrangements of the solid obstacles in the GPM for circular cylindrical obstaclesthe in-line arrangement, and the horizontally and vertically staggered arrangements. However, the staggered arrangements have a lower magnitude of macroscopic flow angle when compared to the in-line arrangement. A change in the obstacle arrangement would alter the path of the vortex wake, and even the vortex structure in the case of vertical staggering, leading to a change in the macroscopic flow angle. A summary of cases set up to study the effect of solid obstacle shape and arrangement is provided in tables 4 and 5. ",

Instead, we introduce necessary criteria for the shape of the solid obstacles towards the occurrence of symmetry-breaking. The deviatory flow occurs for those obstacle shapes, such as the circular cylinder, where the surface geometry is smooth and continuously varying. The symmetry-breaking phenomenon may be restricted by the obstacle geometry if the vortex shedding process is not strong enough to overcome the pressure imposition of the geometry. It is established in the previous section that symmetry breaking is a feature of porous media with low porosity. At low porosity, both the incoming flow and the geometry of the void space contribute to the pressure distribution in the porous medium. The incoming flow determines the magnitude of pressure that is exerted on the walls of the solid obstacles, and the shape of the solid obstacles will determine the distribution of pressure. At high porosity, the influence of the pressure distribution on the solid obstacle wall on the bulk flow is insignificant.",

When square cylinders were used to form the 2D GPM, the deviatory flow did not appear. The 2D flow streamlines for this geometry are plotted in figure 11 , which indicate that the flow pattern is symmetric. Two large recirculating vortices are formed in the streamwise adjacent void when the flow separates at the sharp vertex of the square shaped geometry. The magnitude of stagnation pressure, the strength of the vortices and the favorable pressure gradient distribution are very important factors that promote symmetry breaking. In this square geometry, a converging-diverging section is not present to allow the formation of a favorable pressure gradient through geometry alone. A favorable pressure gradient can be induced through asymmetry in the stagnation pressure after vortex breakdown. However, the locations of the stagnation points in this geometry are fixed by the geometry at the locations of the sharp vertices, which observe perfect symmetry. The vortex shedding process is also different from the case of the circular cylindrical obstacles, as discussed in \u00a74.2.2. The smaller shedding frequency and the weak nature of the vortices in square cylinder obstacles at low porosity do not promote symmetry-breaking. The flow patterns in the cases with square cylindrical obstacles contain zones of strong recirculation. The bulk flow enters the streamwise voids only through the vortex formation process. If the porosity is increased such that the size of the void is equal to the size of the obstacle (\u03c6 = 0.67, Case 17), fluid would enter the void from outside the envelop of the vortex. Theoretically, as the size of the solid obstacle reduces to zero (porosity increases to 1), the solid obstacle shape would cease to influence the flow pattern. This was another objective of increasing the porosity: to induce similarity between circular and square shaped obstacles. However, it should be noted that the reduction of the obstacle size beyond the critical value for symmetry-breaking would diminish the possibility of symmetry breaking. It was observed that the flow pattern for Case 17 was symmetric as well, indicating that it is unlikely that symmetry breaking would occur for a square cylinder solid obstacle geometry because the vertices in the geometry are not conducive to the development of the phenomenon.",

Two important features of this flow pattern lend an explanation to the absence of symmetry breaking. The size of the vortex is much larger than the size of the throat section. This implies that substantial vortex breakdown must occur for fluid entrainment. When a newly shed vortex interacts with the existing recirculating vortex on one side of the obstacle symmetry plane, some fluid is exchanged with the other side. Microscopic asymmetry exists at this location, but vortex breakdown does not occur. The momentum supplied by this asymmetry is not sufficient to shift the direction of the macroscopic flow.

In this document, criteria have been established for the occurrence of symmetry breaking based on the curvature of the geometry. The geometry of the solid obstacle must possess a smooth curvature such that the associated pressure distribution on the wall of the obstacle does not have an abrupt change (which is observed at a sharp vertex). As the magnitude of discontinuity in the contour of the obstacle surface reduces, the probability of the occurrence of symmetry-breaking increases. In the case of square cylinder obstacles, an abrupt change in the pressure distribution is present at the vertex that causes flow separation. When the obstacles are rotated by 45 o , the magnitude of the jump in the pressure gradient is lesser than in the case without rotation, but it is still sufficiently large to result in flow separation at that location. A circular shape may be constructed as a polygon with an infinitely large number of sides. Since symmetry-breaking occurs for an n-sided polygon for a large value of n, the threshold value of n above which symmetrybreaking can occur must be determined in future work. Speculation at this time leads us to believe that the value of n is coupled with the effect of viscous forces. If the flow is able to remain attached for an obstacle shape in creeping flow conditions, it may be conducive to symmetry-breaking in turbulent flow conditions.

Since the macroscopic flow angle is determined by the location of the separation point, a change in the boundary layer may drastically affect the macroscopic flow angle. To investigate the influence of surface roughness, a RANS turbulence model with a log-law rough wall function was used to simulate the flow. For a hydrodynamically smooth surface finish, disparity exists in the macroscopic flow angle between the log-law wall function and a more accurate two-layer TKE wall model. The magnitude of the macroscopic flow angle for the log-law wall function can be assessed with qualitative value only. The macroscopic flow angle decreases as the surface roughness parameter, the equivalent sand grain roughness (Ks + ), increases (refer table 6 ). The change in the macroscopic flow angle with surface roughness is a manifestation of the change in the location of the flow separation point. ",

This is identified to be far enough from the effect of transition to turbulence. Simulations were also performed at lower Reynolds numbers (details in table 7) in order to verify the occurrence of symmetry breaking in the absence of a large momentum reservoir. Below the Reynolds number of 300, the flow patterns are symmetric with large recirculating vortices. In the range of 300 to 500, the macroscopic flow angle jumps from zero to a constant value that is preserved at higher Reynolds numbers. At the transition to deviatory flow, a separation bubble is formed in the shifting stage of the symmetry-breakdown process. The separation bubble is preserved until the strength of the stagnation point is able to overcome the adverse pressure gradient in the diverging section of the void, allowing the flow to remain attached in that region. The strength of the stagnation point for deviatory flow will increase when the Reynolds number is increased. The macroscopic flow field experiences a sudden jump in macroscopic flow angle between the Reynolds number of 300 and 500 when the vortex shedding process evolves. However, the microscopic process that results in the jump is the product of a gradual amplification of the instabilities in the flow. ",

In order to investigate whether the phenomenon is limited to the turbulent flow regime, simulations are performed for the 2D GPM with low porosity by varying the Reynolds number of the flow from the creeping flow regime to the beginning of the fully turbulent flow regime. Only three cases are documented in this work that represent distinct flow behavior. In the case of creeping flow (Rep = 0.1) around a single cylinder in external flow, the flow remains attached throughout the surface of the cylinder. In porous media with low porosity, flow separation occurs at this low value of Reynolds number with a pair of attached vortices formed in the streamwise adjacent void. An attached vortex system cannot induce symmetry breaking because of its inability to breakdown and dissipate away from the separation point. This implies that the Reynolds number at which a detached vortex system is first formed would mark the beginning of the symmetry-breaking regime.",

Turbulent boundary layers are prone to enhanced fluid mixing that allows the flow to stay attached for a greater distance from the stagnation point. At Rep = 500, a separation bubble exists (refer figure 15(b) ) at the leading phase side on the cylindrical surface. In this case, the separation points for the top and bottom vortices are located on opposing sides of the obstacle symmetry plane and yet, deviatory flow is observed. Flow entrainment after the vortex breakdown stage supplies adequate momentum to the boundary layer flow to reattach on the obstacle surface at a downstream location and proceeds to separate again on the same side of the obstacle symmetry plane. As a result, flow separation occurs twice for the boundary layer on one side with the appearance of a separation bubble to cope with the y-momentum supplied by flow entrainment despite the unavailability of momentum in the boundary layer to overcome the viscous shear. As the Reynolds number increases, the size of the separation bubble is expected to slowly diminish as the location of the separation point shifts downstream. At a Reynolds number of 3,000, the separation bubble vanishes entirely. The macroscopic flow angle has the same magnitude with and without the separation bubble. This indicates that there exists a discontinuity in the macroscopic flow angle at the point where the vortex system changes from an attached to a detached configuration. The physical process that results in the change is gradual, when the microscopic von Karman instability derives momentum from the bulk flow, subject to availability, towards its amplification. Instabilities in the flow introduced by the unsteady and non-linear nature of the flow field will be damped at lower Reynolds numbers. The ability of the flow to damp the instabilities will diminish as the Reynolds number increases since the instabilities will derive energy from the inertia of the flow. At a critical value of the Reynolds number, the instabilities start to amplify resulting in a detached vortex system with a phase difference in vortex shedding, which in turn results in deviatory flow.",

The imbalances in the flow that are inherent in the von Karman instability are amplified and sustained with the help of the confining geometry in porous media with low porosity.

Porosity is one of the fundamental governing parameters that decides the appearance of deviation. It is observed that the macroscopic flow angle is more pronounced for lower porosities. However, the macroscopic angle decreases once a critical value of porosity is reached. The circularity (2-D) or sphericity (3-D) of the solid obstacles is an essential parameter for this phenomenon, due to the reliance of the flow on the geometry to remain attached in regions of adverse pressure gradient. The Reynolds number of the flow must be in the regime of fully turbulent flow in order for the flow to possess sufficient momentum to withstand the deviation. The effect of surface roughness on the obstacle walls was also investigated in this work by using a RANS turbulence model that simulates surface roughness by using a wall function.
