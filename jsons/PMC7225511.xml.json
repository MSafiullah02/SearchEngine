Suppose that a customer makes a new order for type 1 while type 1 die cutters are busy processing a former order. The cardboard manufacturer can either wait until type 1 become idle again and possibly miss its production goal or re-configure a type 2 die cutter (if available) to serve as a substitute. Such interoperability is a critical goal for the cardboard manufacturer to avoid interruptions in the production process, but traditional manual mapping and configuration practices take time and anticipating all possible scenarios at design-time is often infeasible.",

A Digital Twin (DT) exposes a set of services allowing to execute certain operations and produce data describing its activity. DTs are typically used to query or manipulate the state of the shop floor and the availability of DT data can have a huge impact on the design of manufacturing processes. We can imagine shop floor data stored in a factory data space together with other information, e.g., data available from the company\u2019s employment and production history, business data and worker preferences. Such information in the data space can be used to allow agility of the manufacturing process and even automatic composition of the intermediate steps for achieving a production goal, for instance by suggesting a specific mapping for automatic configuration of the type 2 die cutter in the example above.",

Authors in [1] introduce a DT reference model for a cloud-based cyber-physical system (such as a smart city) based on a smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network. They provide a context-based control decision scheme that uses Bayesian networks and fuzzy logic based rules to select any of these system modes for inter-system interactions. Authors in [13] introduce a novel architecture for large-scale DT platforms including a distributed DT cooperation framework, flexible data-centric communication middleware, and the platform-based DT application to develop a reliable advanced driver assistance system. Finally, the work of [11] provides a conceptual model and specific operation mechanisms for a DT shop-floor, that is, a basic unit of manufacturing, where data from both physical and virtual sides as well as the fused data are provided to drive all the steps of the production process. For sake of completeness, we also mention the concepts of Digital Shadow (DS) and Digital Model (DM). While in DTs the state of the physical object can affect the state of the digital object and vice-versa, (i) in DSs only the state of the physical object can affect the state of the digital object, and (ii) in DMs the state of the digital object is computed via simulation. We refer the reader to [8] for more discussion.",

            "text": "Polystores. In digital factories, it is of strategic importance to provide effective mechanisms for searching information along diverse and distributed data sources. Data interoperability and integration techniques have been proposed as a way for resolving the structural and semantic heterogeneities that can exist between data stored in distinct repositories. However, such techniques can be difficult to implement for the many organizations deploying polyglot architectures with different data management systems  [7]. Polystores [10], together with its first reference implementation BigDAWG [5] have been proposed recently as a valuable solution for this scenario. A polystore system provides a loosely coupled integration over multiple, disparate data models and query languages. In this system, queries are posed over islands of information, i.e. collections of data sources, each accessed with a single query language, and the same data can be accessed from multiple islands. The issue of data manipulation in polystores has been addressed in different papers. In [9], the authors propose the introduction of a probabilistic relation that allows the enrichment of query answering with data outside the queried data source but available in the polystore (Fig. 1).",

A DT exposes a Web API consisting, in general, of three parts: the synchronous one, the query interface and the asynchronous one. The synchronous interface allows to give instructions to the physical entity. These instructions may, for example, produce a state change in a manufacturing machine (in case the twin is over a machine) or ask a human operator to perform a manual task (in case the twin is over a manufacturing worker). The query interface allows for asking information to the physical entity about its state and accessing the related data (possibly by applying diagnostic and prognostic functions results of machine learning).

This task is fulfilled by the mediator. The mediator acts in two phases: the synthesis phase and the execution/recovery phase. During the synthesis phase, the specifications of the APIs exposed by digital twins and the meta-data (e.g. data source schemas) available in the data space, are composed in order to construct a mediator process. During the execution/recovery phase, the mediator run his program and detects possible variations with respect to reference practices (such as, the presence of a type 2 die cutter as a substitute of a type 1 die cutter in Example 1). Detection can be done by using situation calculus to model the manufacturing process, sending a run-time alert when there is no further step available in the process and identifying the DTs involved in the anomaly (such as, type 2 die cutter in Example 1). Upon detection of a variation, the mediator can perform the recovery task by composing the required input/output messages requested by the anomalous DTs and thus integrating them into the regular manufacturing process. To this end, the mediator can explore the factory data space, translate and integrate the data available to comply with the format requested by the DTs involved in the recovered sequencing/interleaving. A technique for exploring data spaces modelled a polystore is described in [9]. In this context, DTs can be modeled as guarded automaton [2]: the synchronous API of the DT corresponds to input messages of the guarded automaton and the data contained in the local storage is part of the polystore defining the process.",
