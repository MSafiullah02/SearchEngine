Scales to measure organization and environmental factors were tested for reliability using Cronbach's \u03b1 raw scores, and all had reliability scores of 0.7 and above.5 Ethics approval for the initial study was obtained from the administering organization, the partner academic institution, and all 6 participating hospitals. Ethics approval for this secondary analysis was obtained from the administering hospital's Research Ethics Board.",

Individual safety-climate dimension scores were summed, averaged by the number of participants in the unit, and multiplied by 100% to generate a positive percentage score for each unit. To remain consistent with the primary study published, where individuals received a 0 or a 1 for each safety climate dimension,5 all unit-level safety climate scores were analyzed as dichotomous variables. Due to the low percentage of positive responses observed in this dataset, a cutoff of 50% was chosen instead of the 60% recommended in the literature. Therefore, if a unit had >50% of individuals reporting a positively for a safety climate dimension, the unit received a score of 1.",

These findings are consistent with several studies, and support the notion that units develop their own interpretation of the global or hospital-level organizational climate.13, 18 Units may differ in various aspects, including patient factors such as severity, complexity, acuity of illness, and length of stay; workforce factors such as staffing levels, nurse type mix, average tenure, education, and training; and performance factors such as pace of work, technologic complexity, and communication and management style of frontline managers.11, 17, 27 Together, unit differences in patient type, staffing composition, and performance expectations may influence nurses' perceptions of the organizations' commitment to safety. From a policy and practice perspective, these findings suggest initiatives tailored to the context of the unit will influence safe work perceptions and behaviors. For example, an organization may have an overarching policy on training and fit testing but require that each unit do a risk assessment and determine additional procedures or requirements needed to keep workers safe and healthy. In those units where the risk of transmission of occupational respiratory disease is low, training may need to be focused on general knowledge and skills with resources available (procedures and experts) for supervisors and workers to access in the event they have a patient with a communicable respiratory disease. In those units where the risk of transmission is high, training may be more frequent, more comprehensive, and may include competency testing. In these 2 scenarios the same overarching organizational policy is in place, but the context of the unit is taken into consideration.",

Although similar studies have examined the variability in the incidence of medical errors, error reporting, and patient outcomes between units,27, 28 ours is the first study to examine variability in adherence to FPE between units. Studies examining the incidence of medical errors found that units with a greater proportion of registered nurses or stronger perceptions of safety climate reported lower incidences of medical errors.27, 29 These studies suggest that policy makers focus their efforts on improving safety climates and introducing more registered nurses to reduce medical errors.27, 29 Therefore, understanding how unit-level factors affect adherence to FPE may have important implications for leaders and policymakers aiming to improve the health and wellness of health care workers.",

The only demographic variable that remained a predictor of adherence was tenure as a nurse, and was associated with a 2% increase in adherence to FPE for every additional year of a nurse's tenure at a hospital. This finding differs from the primary study, which did not report a statistically significant relationship between any of the demographic variables and adherence to FPE use (P \u2264 .05). Differences in the findings of this study and the primary study may be attributed to the nested or hierarchical methodology performed in this study.15 No other studies were found linking tenure and adherence, but higher tenure has been associated with stronger safety climate perceptions.31, 32 Because a strong safety climate influences safe behaviors,33 the role of tenure on safe behaviors might be implicated directly or indirectly through its mediation of safety climate. Therefore, the possibility of an association between tenure and safe behaviors is an important area for further research.",

Such findings add to the safety climate literature by proposing that in addition to organization-level relationships,16, 34 unit-level safety climate relationships with safe behaviors also exist. These relationships support theories that propose that workers' safe behaviors vary within a hospital, and are in part influenced by different unit environments, as well as each unit's frontline managerial staff and their performance expectations.17, 18 Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of good within-unit communication practices in fostering a strong safety climate and a positive commitment to safe behaviors.",

Due to these close interactions, frontline managers have the ability to listen to workers' concerns, exchange information, offer feedback, and ultimately mitigate immediate consequences as part of their daily routine.11, 15, 35, 37 In turn, actions mediated by frontline managers have been shown to produce more frequent and immediate positive outcomes when compared with those of top managerial staff.36\n",

Furthermore, each frontline manager may interpret safety policies and procedures differently depending on the job tasks, environments, and performance expectations within each unit.33, 35, 37 Differences in interpretation and dissemination of such strategies could therefore affect how a particular group of workers perceive a policy, and consequently, their decision to engage in safe work behaviors.17, 33, 35 This creates a potential for discrepancy between formal and executed policy, and may result in workers of particular units becoming misinformed about the organization's priorities.13 The discrepancy between formal and executed policy has been observed in medium-sized manufacturing plants,33 and may be attributed to organization guidelines being vague in defining the roles, goals, and expectations of unit managers.37 To align unit managers to the organizations' priorities, policies need to have flexibility. For example, a policy regarding training and fit testing could set frequency guidance but specify that unit managers can conduct training and fit testing more frequently according to the specific context of the unit. Policies should also include leadership training and development programs for unit managers to promote leadership styles that foster open and frequent communication.38, 39 The role of open and frequent communication regarding the organizations' commitment to safety has been reported in the literature to be positively associated with safe work behaviors.38 Given the association between unit-level safety communication and adherence to FPE demonstrated in this study, interventions targeted at improving frontline managers' communication may be an effective way to address long-standing suboptimal adherence rates.",

Because this study used self-report data, subject recall and social desirability bias may have been a problem. Second, the study sample, consisting of nurses in acute care hospitals located in Toronto, Canada, may also limit the generalizability of the findings to all health professionals, other types of health care organizations, or different geographic locations. Third, dichotomization of unit-level data led to low event rates for certain unit-level safety climate dimensions. The low event rate required a cutoff of 50%, instead of 60%, which is recommended in the literature. Where response rates >60% are said to be representative of a unit's culture or climate,40, 41 the range between 50% and 60% could be seen as important because it represents a transition zone where individual options begin to come together to create a climate of safety. Lastly, the low number of hospital units (6 hospitals) in this study limited the ability to calculate interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).42 ICCs represent the percentage of total variance explained by individual, unit, and hospital levels, and help determine if a statistically significant variation has practical significance.15, 19 Future studies with larger sample sizes could use ICCs to examine both the significance and magnitude of the effect of unit variation on the adherence to FPE.",

Findings demonstrate that units vary significantly in terms of adherence and safety climate dimensions and suggest that aggregated, unit-level perceptions of communication practices regarding safety and availability of FPE were associated with nurses' self-reported adherence to FPE. These results add to the safety climate literature by establishing an association between unit-level safety climate dimensions and adherence to safe work behaviors. This association supports unit-level interventions to be important; specifically, interventions led by frontline managers to improve unit communication practices regarding safety. These interventions could assist in improving safe work behaviors and practices, reduce occupational transmission of communicable respiratory illness, and better protect our health care workers.",
