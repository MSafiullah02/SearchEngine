Seven days into his symptoms, he noted a transient non-pruritic blanching unilateral livedoid patch on the right anterior thigh resembling LR ( Figure 1 ). The eruption lasted for 19 hours and resolved by the time dermatology evaluated the patient; thus no biopsy was taken. Concurrent with the lacy patches on the leg, the patient also noted gross hematuria and generalized weakness. In concert with the netlike exanthem, the hematuria resolved within 24 hours. He was eventually discharged home stable on supplemental oxygen.",

We postulate that manifestations can vary from transient LR in mild-moderate cases to acrocyanosis in critically ill patients. Because our patients were not critically ill, perhaps they had transient low-grade DIC, and the concurrent hematuria in Patient 1 could be explained by a possible micro-embolic event causing glomerulonephritis or cystitis. However, due to the evanescent nature of their LR-like eruptions, they were not biopsied. Interestingly, exanthems have not been described for other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In the future, histopathology of active exanthema may be helpful in elucidating the underlying pathology of the cutaneous and perhaps systemic manifestations of COVID-19 infection. Additionally, platelet count, coagulation studies, and fibrin degradation products assessments in these patients would be enlightening.",
