An increased content of the analogue in the medium prevents morphological aberrations and postpones the onset of the lysis of cells. During growth with the analogue an autolytie system is activated and its activity outlasts for a certain time yen after the addition of dap. The increased activity of the autolytie enzymes results in turnover of murein, the rate of which is indirectly proportional to the concentration of the analogue. The dap analogue can apparently replace dap in the synthesis of murein. However, as the affinity of enzymes incorporating dap is probably lower to the analogue as compared with that to the natural substrate, synthesis of murein is impaired during growth of the dap-mutant in the presence of low concentrations of Ott-dap being manifested in a similar way as the effect of penicillin. Therefore the proto-Srophic strains grows no,sally in the presence of OH-dap, in spite of the fact that it incorporates She analogue.",

After a transfer of cells of Escherichia cell exposed in the mineral medium at 37~ to the SyB medium with radioactive precursors the incorporation of both valine and adenine is decreased, depending on time of the starvation.

            "text": "It follows from our previous studies that histone added externally to Escherickia cell influences protein synthesis probably at the level of transcription and the mechanism of its action depends on growth phase of the culture. In this study another model organism, Bacillus cereus, in which individual stages of differentiation are morphologically characterized, was used. The effect of histone on the early stage of development of the vegetative cell from the spore was studied so far. It was found that during this stage histone inhibits incorporation of 14Cleucine into cellular proteins. Its effect cannot be removed by adding higher concentrations of certain monovalent or divalent cations. The incorporation of 14C-uracil into the total RNA fraction was substantially inhibited as well. The results obtained favour the idea that even in this case histone influences protein synthesis at the level of transcription. Thus, it can be assumed that the effect of histone in microorganisms is apparently of general validity. It has already been shown that histone influences protein synthesis in Escherichia eoli and Bacillus cereus. In addition, it was found that histone can penetrate into the cells of Eseherichia coll. Therefore it was of interest to investigate whether the addition of histone to these organisms results also in ultrastructttral changes. Comparison of ultrathin sections of cells of Eseherichia coli in the absence and presence of histone revealed the following differences: (1) In control cells both the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane are well visible, ribosomes and nuclear structure can be seen in the cytoplasm.",

In both types (non-germinated and partially germinated spores) a fine electron-dense layer at the surface of the exosporium was detected. Heat-activated spores (65~ rain) of Bacillus cereus were germinated in a minimal medium which does not facilitate a further development. A limited synthesis of proteins and (tested by incorporation of 14C-leucine) and RNA (tested by incorporation of 14C-uracil) took place. Synthesis of the cell wall [measured by incorporation of 14C-diaminopimelic acid (dap)] continued for several hours. The above mentioned synthetic processes were studied in a medium containing the exudate released during germination of spores and in a fresh medium replacing after the germination the original one. Synthesis of the cell wall was accelerated in the presence of the exudate. In a limited medium the incorporation of 14C-dap was highly actinomycin D -sensitive and relatively chloramphenicol-resistant. The spore exudate accelerated also synthesis of proteins and RNA. After germination of radioactive spores, the cortical layer of which was prelabeled with 14C-dap, a laC-dap-containing material was released into the medium. The incorporation of 14C-dap from the exudate after germination of the labeled spores into germinated unlabeled spores was negligible. The presented results are discussed with respect to a possible reutilization of the exudate components by the germinated spores in a limited medium.",

            "text": "Procaryotic cells, bacterial cells in the first place, are suitable also for studying certain basic yet not fully understood developmental problems. It was found by analysis (mainly electrophoretic) of the bacterial cytoplasm and its components (ribosomes and membranes in particular) that the cytoplasm deprived of ribosomes practically does not contain basic proteins. Under physiological conditions cytoplasm thus cannot represent a typical dieomplex coacervate with polyionie linkages. This coacervate would be unsuitable for complex biochemical processes due to its high viscosity, strong interactions among components, relatively simple structure etc. Cytoplasm is apparently of a more 56 adequate character of a colloid sol of a tricomplex type. Basic proteins are contained in ribosomes and partially in cytoplasmic membranes that can be considered as \"coacervate residues\" in the cell. Development of the cell lasting probably for more than four billion years is characterized by a complex developmental differentiation and specialization of both individual macromoleeules, their interactions and functions and multimoleeular systems, cellular structures and the whole cell. Our ideas about the evolution of cellular structures and their coordination functions are experimentally supported by studies on the effect of basic proteins on synthesis of polyadenylie acid by the enzyme polynucleotide-phosphorylase. Certain basic proteins, e.g. histone, stimulate synthesis of this polymer forming mostly flocculate or eoacervate complexes that are resistant to ribonuclease. In this model multimolecular enzyme system synthesis is favoured and degradation is limited. A scheme of a possible evolution from molecules and the coacervate stage to the cell is discussed. From the evolutionary point of view the cell can be con-~idered as a developed and complex supercoacervate system. This system retains certain simpler nteractions, relationships and structures from its early, probably coacervate, precellular history. A mixed population of nucleus-containing and nucleus-free protoplasts originates when preparing protopla~ts from logarithmically growing cell of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by means of snail enzymes.",

            "text": "During submerged cultivation in a Niekerson medium the yeast Trigonopsia variabilis grows as a mixture of triangular and oval cells. Electron microscopic studies of both forms of cells after fixation with KMnO4 and fixation according to Sabatini and coworkers showed that their inner structure is comparable with that of other, particularly ascomycetal yeasts. This holds true also for uitrastructure of the cell wall of both forms, for budding and for character of scars on the mother cell, except for the fact that on ultrathin sections chitin tears could not be observed. From above the triangular cells have a shape of equilateral triangle with rounded peaks and with sides depressed inside. On a cross section they appear as flat discs. Budding takes place at the peaks of the triangular cells. In the oval cells budding occurs mostly on one of the poles of the cell, whereas in the triangular forms the termini are equivalent with respect to their ability to form buds. The cell wall is identical in the two types, it is three-layered and covered with a layer of mueigel. Cytochemical staining of polysaceharides showed that ultrastructure of the cell wall of the two forms is also identical and resembles that of Savcharo~nycete~. A centripetal proliferation of the inner layer of the cell wall could be obgerved in the triangular forms in the middle part of their inside depressed sides. This proliferation is associated with an increased number of invaginations attached to the plasmalemma. These anomalies were not observed in the oval cells. On the basis of the above observations it can be assumed that the inner layer of the cell wall, together with the system of invaginations of the plasmalemma, play the most important role in the process of triangular morphogenesis of the yeast Trigonovariabilis. A mixed culture of ellipsoid and triangular forms growing in a worth medium was frozen in Freons 22 and liquid nitrogen, either directly, or after incubation in 20% glycerol or after fixation with 5% glutaraldehyde and incubation in 20--30% glycerol. Studies of replicas in an electron microscope did not reveal any substantial differences in a submicroscopic structure of both vegetative forms except for the outer shape of the cells. The cell wall of the two forms is of the same thickness and its surface is smooth. A fine fibrillary material could be observed only after fixation with glutaraldehyde. On a fracture a granular structure discriminated to two layers can be observed. The cytoplasmic membrane is covered with granules 10--15 ram in size. These granules are missing at the site of invaginations. In both vegetative forms no considerable differences could be detected, both in arrangement of the granules and localization of the invaginations. The cytoplasm contains numerous mitoehondria and rare cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. Clusters of short elsteruae with small vesicles, perhaps analogues of the dietyosome, were observed on several fractures. The nucleus is relatively large and nuclear pores can 57 be seen on its surface. The described ultrastructure corresponds to a typical structure of the yeast cell. A submicroscopic correlate of the microscopic difference between the triangular and ellipsoid form was not detected. The cell wall plays an important role in conjugation of yeasts. Modification of the shape of conjugating cells, their fusion facilitated by eonjugative channels and lysis of the septum separating conjugating cells forming the zygote are the main stages of the wall differentiation. However, individual wall architectures of conjugating cells of budding, apieulate and dividing yeasts do not influence this differentiation. The interaction with the competitive cell is the most important factor here. Control mechanisms of the formation of zygotes, associated with enzymic activities linked to the wall and with production of hormonal com-pound~ are discussed.",

            "text": "The autoradiographic method on ultrathin sections was used to localize enzymes involved in biosynthesis of mannan in yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae under conditions of selective incorporation of exogenous n-mannose-3H into mannan (1). After a 1 rain incubation of cells in a medium conraining radioactive mannose the predominating portion of the incorporated radioactivity was localized in the cytoplasm and in membranes of endoplasmic retieulum in the neighborhood of plasmalemma. In cells that were just in the stage of division the radioactivity was concentrated in the neighbourhood of the septum to be formed. When after a 1 min incubation with radioactive mannose the cells were incubated for a further 10 rain in a non-radioactive growth medium, the predominating portion of the radioactivity was detected in the cell wall. Structures resembling the Golgi apparatus could not be observed on ultrathin sections. Thus, it is assumed that enzymes synthesizing mannan are not exclusively bound to these structures, but are probably associated even with membranes of endoplasmic reticulum. It cannot be excluded that these enzymes are activated in those membranes occurring in the proximity of sites, in which an intensive construction of the cell wall just takes place. It was found by means of separation of the cell membranes in density gradients (2) that fractions of membranes of the endoplasmic retieulum contain roughly a 12-fold specific activity of mannan-synthetase as compared with fractions of the plasmalemma.",

It has already been shown that under conditions of low aeration (KLa ~ 1.25--4.6 rain -1) the growing culture is influenced by the oxygen limit. In Addition, when pH is decreased naturally, cytological changes occure on the inner side of the cell wall, mostly in the form of equatorial rings (~nejdaret ed., 1973) . Chemical analyses show that under good aeration conditions (KLa ~ 11.8 rain-l) and at constant pH 4.5 the content of glucosamine and protein in the cell walls equals to 1.88~o and 8.5%, respectively (A type). When aeration is decreased the above values increase reaching up to 6.04 --6.6 ~o glucosamine and 11.5 --13.5 ~o proteins at KI~ ~ 3.3 min-1, irrespective of whether pH of the cultivation was regulated or not and, thus, shether the cells form under the influence of pH the rings or not (B type). X-ray analysis of the cell walls of the B type revealed presence of chitin, whereas in the walls of the B type chitin can be detected only after partial hydrolyses being localized exclusively in mother scars. In the B type of the cell walls chitin is localized in the whole cell wall and not only in the ring. A relationship between KLa and content of protein and chitin in the cell walls exists. As shown by X-ray diffraction the content of nitrogen, ghicosamine and sugars in the cell walls of the B type does not change considerably when the yeasts are cultivated within the range of KLa ~ 1.25--4.6 min -1. However, under ~8 the influence of pH they can differ only cytologically by the presence of the ring. Gass chromatography revealed the presence of glucose, mannose and arabinose and their quantitative proportions do not considerably differ, irrespective of whether the amount of the ring is 0, 40 and/or 80%. It follows from comparison of the chemical composition of sugars in the cell walls of the A and B types that the proportion of arabinose decreases with increasing KL, whereas the amount of glucose increases. Partial hydrolyses of the cell walls conraining the equatorial ring show that the ring is constructed from the same glyeoprotein material as the rest of the cell wall; the cell walls of yeasts cultivated at the same KL and differing only by the presence of the ring have roughly identical chemical ~omposition.",

Fluorescence microscopy following \"staining\" of scars by primulin was used to discriminate between mother and daughter cells. In a population of ~qaccharomyces eerevisiae the average size of mother cells containing one to two scars reaches about 150 ~3 and does not change substantially with increasing growth rate. However, the growth rate considerably influences site of the scar-less daughter cells. At D1 : 0.05 and 0.1 \u2022 h -1 the daughter cells reach about 40% volume of mother cells, at D~ : 0.25 x h -1 this value equals 73% and at D1 : 0.35 \u2022 h -1 the daughter cells are practically of the same size as the mother cells (97%). Size of mother cells with four scars was indirectly proportional to the growth \"rate and was apparently a function of the time of delay. In a population of Candida utilis the growth rate is of considerable importance even for the average size of the mother cells ranging from 25 ~3 to 50 ~t 3 at the lowest and highest growth rate, respectively. The relative size of the daughter and mother cells was similar as in the population of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results are discussed with respect to a physiological state conditioning separation of the daughter and mother cells in the populations of yeasts. Generally, it can be postulated that the higher the growth rate of the population the more physiologically similar is the daughter cell to its mother cell and the shorter the time interval between its separation and origin of a new bud on its surface. The specific carrier for monosaecharides in Savcharomyees cerevisiae does not transfer sugars with the axial hydroxyl group at C-4. The galaetose induced carrier transports these sugars preferentially. 4-Deoxy-glucose (which is simultaneously 4-deoxygalactose) is transferred by both carriers with an activation energy of 40--30 kJ/mol, thus indicating that neither of the carriers requires the presence of the hydroxyl group at C-4. 4-Deoxy-D-glucose is apparently oxidized without phosphorylation in yeasts. 6-Deoxy-D-glueose is also transferred by both transport systems, but it is not further changed inside the ceils. None of the sugars can serve as substrate for yeast hexokinase.",

The increased transport may be explained in two ways: (1) The previous incubation results in the accumulation of energy sources required for the transport of amino acids; (2) the levels of intracellular amino acids decrease during the preincubation due to the proceeding protein synthesis and the trans-inhibitory effect on the transport is thus removed. Determination of the total intraeellular level of amino acids after different types of preincubation followed by deprivation show that the second explanation is not likely (after ethanol the total level of amino acids does not change at, all decreasing to about 50% after glucose).

Out of a total of 75 mutants 15 were selected for further studies. These mutants grow slowly in a medium containing glucose and do not grow at all even after 7 days in the presence of acetate. It was assumed that the decreased growth rate was caused by a defect in the respiratory system and energetic metabolism. The inability to grow in the medium with acetate was recessive in all studied mutants. It was found on the basis of the analysis of segregation of basidiospores after crossing of these mutants with standard strains that in 11 mutants the inability to grow in the acetate medium is due to a mutation in the nuclear gene. An extranuclear mutation can be assumed in 1 mutant. Results of mutual complementation made it possible to estimate a minimum of 8 nuclear loci governing the utilization of acetate. Measurement of the respiratory capacity by the oxygen electrode showed that the KCN-sensitive respiration was decreased in one nuclear mutant. The role of mitochondria in germination of spores of filamentous fungi was investigated. It was found that strict anacrobiosis, cyanide, azide, oligomyein, bongkrekic acid, acriflavin and ethidium bromide prevent germination of spores of Aapergillus niger and Penicillium ited~,~um in a liquid germination medium. The effect of azide, oligomycin, bongkrekic acid and ethidium bromide was of fungicidal type.

Oligomycin, bongkrekic acid and ethidium bromide reduced the incorporation of both precursors during first hours of the germination of eonidia, inhibiting it completely during further hours of incubation. The inhibition of the germination of spores as well as the inhibition of synthesis of macromolecules during germination of the conidia of Aspergillus niger were related with the specific inhibitory effect of these compounds on the respiratory activity of dormant conidia and mycelial cells.

            "text": "Wild fungi are little \"known microorganisms belonging mostly to the order Moniliates reacting to the presence of nematodes by the formation of passive or active trapping structures for catching microscopic worms. It was found that Arthrobotrya conoides, Arthrobotrys dactyloides, Arthrobotrys oligoslaora and Monacrosporium rutgeriensis produce attractors highly effective for nematodes. The attracted worms are caught by the trapping structures and killed by the produced toxic compounds. The presence of worms induces formation of the trapping structures. In addition, production of attractors and even toxic compounds is induced or stimulated. The chemical nature of the produced attractors has not yet been elucidated; however, it has been found that one of the compounds is 3\"5'e-AMP, but this latter compound itself is much less effective than filtrates of media after the submerged cultivation. The observed facts indicate that th~ 61 worm may be attacked by the wild fungus as follows: The trapping structures are formed as a morphological reaction to the presence of nematodes, production of the attractors being induced or stimulated at the same time. The concentration gradient of the attractor attracts the worm to the trapping structures and formation of nematocides is induced or stimulated simultaneously. ]=Iyphac of the fungus then enter the body of the nematode which serves as a source of nutrition. A semiquantitative method for determining the attraction will be briefly described. Many organic dyes degrading photodynamically purine bases or aromatic amino acids during irradiation with light of a suitable wavelength in the presence of oxygen exist. On the other hand, data concerning a similar effect of inorganic ions are only limited. Studies of the interaction of metals with DNA showed that the quality of DNA changes with the time of contact with Fo 3+ ions. The effect of light of a wavelength higher than 310 nm on purine and pyrimidine bases in the presence of FeCls and at pH 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 was hence investigated. Concentration of bases before and after the photoreactivation was studied speetrophotometrically. The highest decrease of bases was found at pH 3 in the case of pyrimidines. Purines are nonreative under these conditions. Kinetic measurements of thymine showed that %he reaction is first order and is decelerated slowed down by formaldehyde, indicating that OH. ions are the active agent here. Paper chromatography revealed the presence of thymine-glycols (cis and trails), thymine -hydroperoxides (cis and trans ), 5-hydroxymethyluracil, 6-hydro-5-hydroxyorotie acid, 6-hydroxy-5-hydrothymine and a product that could not be identified by this technique. Mass spectremerry identified this product as thymine hydrate. It follows from the in vitro experiments that the irradiation of aqeous solutions of pyrimidine bases with light of wave length higher than 310 nm in the presence of ferric ions results in degradation of bases, independently of the presence of oxygen in the medium. When studying in viva survival of the bacterial strain Escherichia coli K 12, Sm r, ),s we used solutions of Fe a+, v/z. FeCls-sodium citrate, ferric ammonium citrate, potassium (hexa/cyanoferrate/III) and FeCls-Tris at pH 5. The irradiation was performed with light of wave length higher than 31O nm and intensity of 800 erg/mm2/s, tern-perature of samples at the end of the irradiation did not exceed 22~ The highest effect was found with 10-2M FeCls in 10-2M sodium citrate, when a dose of 96 \u2022 104 erg]mm 2 yielded 5.8~o survival, whereas in the control in the absence of Fe a+ a minimum of 90~o bacteria survived. In the system containing 10-2M ferric ammonium citrate 60% bacteria survived. The systems with 10-2~ potassium (hexa/cyanoferrate/III) and FeC13-Tris did not differ from the controls. The photosensitization effect of K4Mo(CN)s, MnC12, 0oSO4, UO2(C2HsO2)2 and CuSO4 at concentrations from 10-4~ to 10-2~ was investigated in a similar way. It appears that the transition metals behave similarly to the well known organic dyes. However, these metals do not require the presence of oxygen, so that rather a clear photosensitization effect than photodynamics is involved here. When the cells of .gscherichia cell B/r Hcr+ thytrp-are. transferred from a complete synthetic glucose medium to a medium without thymine they lose their colony forming ability after 45 min and frequency of trp \u00a7 revertants increases in the surviving fraction. Thymine starvation lasting up to 40 min (which does not substantially influence viability of cells and frequency of trp + revertants in the non-irradiated culture} decreases resistance and increases mutability of the cells as compared with the control from the exponential phase of growth. As compared with the control the irradiation of the prestarved culture with a dose of 756 erg. mm -2 results in a delayed DNA synthesis and higher DNA degradation. However, excision of thymine dimers is not influenced. The lower survival of cells after the IYV irradiation can be explained by the increased degradation of DNA after the irradiation, due to the inhibition of DNA ligase. As the mutations can be manifested only in the surviving population, the higher frequency of the UV-indueed trp + reyertants in the prestarved culture must be brought about by a complete but a less accurate filling of gaps in DI~A, originating by excision of thymine dimers and other damage caused by the UV radiation. Experimental details: M medium + 2 ~g/ml thymine -b 28 ~zg/ml DLtryptophan served as a complete medium; viability was determined on the same medium solidified with 2%agar; the same plates with a decreased content of DL-tryptophan (1.5 btg. m1-1) served to determine the trp + revertants; synthesis and degradation of DNA labelled with T-2A4C (I~VVR, Prague) was determined in a TCA-preeipitable fraction; DNA used for a radioehromatographic determination of thymine dimers, in the hydrolysate of high molecular DNA, was labelled in the same way. Content of guanine and cytosine (GC) in DNA of two strains of Pasteurella multocida, eight strains of pasteurella pneumotropica and fourteen strains of Pusteurella ureae, isolated from pathological changes or from upper respiratory tract of man and domestic or laboratory animals, was determined. The method of Marmur (1961) based on heat denaturation in 10-2M phosphate buffer with 10-aM EDTA, pH 7, was applied. Calculation of GC content from the ratio E2~0/E2s0 according to Frederieq (1961) served as the control method. Average values of the GC content in Pasteurella multocida were 38.65~o, the overall range was 38.6--38.7~o. Corresponding values in Pasteurella pne~tmotropica and Pasteurella ureae were 39.6% (37.1--40.8%) and 41.6% (38.3--45.5~o), respectively. The obtained results reveal a close relationship among all studied species and a genetic homogeneity of the whole genus. Further classification of the genus Pasteuretla thus consists in existing differences in tbe~r biochemical properties. Enzymic degradation of DiNA causes a relatively high radiosensitivity of Acholeplasma laidlawii (Do = 5000 rad). It follows from the hitherto experiments, in which changes in molecular weight of DNA of irradiated cells of Aeholeplasma laidlawii were followed by means of centrifugation in neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients, that the induction of single and double breaks highly depends on the presence of oxygen during the irradiation. The absorption of 58 eV in the presence of O2 at 0~ results in a single break in the DNA molecule, whereas the absorption of 469 eV gives origin to a double break. Removal of oxygen results in an increase of these values to 159 and 1863 eV, respectively. The relationship between the radiation dose and number of single or double breaks in the molecule of DNA cannot be accurately determined, when the enzymic degradation occurring after the irradiation is not excluded or minimized. Repair of breaks in DiNA after the irradiation with gamma rays could not be observed in the studied strain. In the other group of experiments a question, whether the UV irradiation of Acholeplasma laidlawii results in degradation of DNA, similar to that after the irradiation with ionizing radiation, was investigated. It was found that the UV radiation does not bring about the enzymic degradation of DNA in Acheleplasma laidlawii. In addition to the enzymic degradation, the occurrence of DNA fragments of low molecular weight was also followed using doses from Do to doses several times higher. A possible repair of the originating damage was also followed. Double auxotrophic mutants were obtained in the prototrophie PA strain of Mycobacterium phlei by treating auxotrophic mutants, induced in the first step by UV radiation or N-methyl-N-nitroso-N'-nitrogxtanidine (nitrosoguanidine), with nitrosoguanidine under standard conditions (concentration 1 mg/ml, pit 6, survival of cells of the basic suspension 5--10~o). Four auxotrophic mutants were used: PA met and PA h/s induced by nitrosoguanidine and mutants PA h/s and PA leu induced by UV radiation. The induction of double auxotrophic mutants was evaluated quantitatively in original single auxotrophie mutants and the results were compared with those obtained with the prototrophic PA strain. Only the PA leu mutant retained practically the same sensitivity to a repeated mutagenie treatment (detection of newly induced auxotrophic mutants 0.23~o) as that observed in the original prototrophie PA strain (detection of auxotrophic mutants 0.11~o). On the other hand, the remaining three single auxotrophic mutants exhibited a higher resistance to a repeated treatment with the mutagen (detection of newly induced auxotrophic mutants 0.02--0.03%). It cannot be concluded, whether this fact can be ascribed to changed structural conditions of DkNA previously treated with the mutagen. The induction of newly induced phenotypes probably depends to a certain extent on character of an already existing mutational change. In the mutant PA met we obtained a broad range of phenotypes frequently induced in the prototrophie PA strain (e.g. arg, his, leu, ileu-val, pur, pyr etc.) . Completely new phenotypes (co-aminobutyric acid, riboflavin) were also detected. In the PA his strain (originally induced by UV radiation) phenotypes leu, ileu, val predominated, whereas in the PA leu strain the phenotype set was most common; the lys phenotype was also detected and the put phenotype was rather rare. Other changes of the phenotype could not be detected.",

We assume that the DNA synthesis is necessary for completion of replication cycles that were not fully completed under the conditions of synchronization. The addition of thymine for 5 min beginning at any time interval within 35--55 rain induces division of a fraction\" of cells beginning with the 60th min of incubation. It follows that completion of replication of the chromosome is necessary for the division, but it is not a signal of a time process determining the interval, when the subsequent division will take place. As chloramphcnicol added after 45 rain did not inhibit division induced by the addition of thymine 50 rain after the synchronization, it may be assumed that after completion of the replication cycle protein synthesis associated with the division need not proceed. If thus synthesis of a regulatory protein were associated with completion of the blutagenesis of the replication point of auxotrophic mutants of the PA strain of Myeobaeterium phlci was studied from the point of view of induetion of resistance to antitubereulosis agents. Mutagenic processes were induced by N-methyl-Nnitroso-N'-nitroguanidine, the mutagenic activity of which is maximal in the replicating region of DNA. The method of induction of revertants in a synchronized culture, consisting of the synchronization procedure and the mutational process proper, was applied. The culture was synchronized by a combination of the cold shock with a previous centrifugation. The procedure of the induction of revertants in the synchronized culture has already been worked out and verified with three auxotrophic mutants of Mycobacterium phlei. In this work we used double auxotrophic mutants PA leu met, PA met put, PA met arg, in which the induction of reversions was followed, and single mutants PA met and PA leu, in which the induction of resistance to streptomycin, ethionamide, cycloserine and resistomycin was investigated. By calculating maximal induction of the followed mutational changes we determined localization of eight genes on the chromosome of Mycobacterium phlei. It was found that D-glucosamine and D-galartosamine form a determinant part of receptors of the competence factor (CF) on the surface of the Pneuraoeoccus (Kohoutovs and Kocourek, l~ature 247, 277 1974) . Binding of CF to the receptors as a function of time was followed biologically in a transformation medium without bovine serum albumin. Under these conditions the control without the added CF was zero. Already after 3--5 min at 37~ the receptor is bound completely to the receptors. This is demonstrated by a loss of activity in the supernataut. After 10 rain, when the induetion of competence in non-competent ceils roaches its maximum, CF is released from the receptors to the supernatant. Under conditions, when the spontaneous competence originates cyclically in the recipient culture, CF is cyclically bound to receptors of non-competent cells. However, after the induction only a single sharp peak of competence with a maximum after 10 rnin can be detected.",

Two R-factors and sometimes R-factor and col-factor were present in cells of some strains. However, the serotype of the strains or an occasional ability to haemolyze red blood cells were not associated with the presence of a col-factor or R-factor of a certain fi character. Degree of resistanee determined by the R-factors differed only insignificantly in the Citrobactsr and Escherichia eoli K 13 Hit. Resistance was induced to ehloramphenicol (256 ~zg/ml and more), neomycin (126 to 256 [zg/ml), streptomycin (8--512 ~zg/ml and even higher values found in the studied strains were not transferred) and tetracycline (64--512 ptg/ml). Concentrations of chloramphenieol, streptomycin and tetracycline that can be reached in urine are 30 [zg/ml, 1000 ~zg/ml and 300 ~tg/ml, respectively. It follows that the application of the antibiotic does not result in selection of the R + strains of bacteria only in the case of streptomycin. From the comparison of sensitivity of the R-and R + bacteria concentrations of the antibiotics suitable for the selection of the R + exconjugants can be deduced: 25 ~tg/ml of chloramphenieol, neomycin and tetraeycline and apparently only 5 ~zg/ml of streptomycin with a subsequent control of the presence of the R-factor in this latter case. As all strains resistant to streptomycin were also insensitive to spectinomycin, it may be assumed that the mechanism of resistance consists in adenylation of molecules of the above-mentioned antibiotics. In strains Escherichia coli K12 X8011, liK26 and liK66, infected with the Rl-drd 19 plasmid we tested activity of the enzyme chloramphenicol--aeetyl-transferase, coded for by the above-mentioned plasmid. The enzyme was isolated during different phases of growth of cultures, the activity was measured in supernatants of sonieates by means of a standard spectrophotometric method. The enzyme is synthesized constitutively and its synthesis is regulated by catabolite repression. The specific activity is increased 5--10 times during the stationary phase in a complete medium (PNS); the number of enzyme units per cell increases also during this period. It was demonstrated that the increase of the specific activity of the enzyme is caused by synthesis of the enzyme de novo, being repressed by higher concentrations of glucose and blocked in the presence of ehlortetracyeline. The apeeifie activity of the enzyme did not increase in the synthetic medium (M9), on the contrary, the number of enzyme units per cell decreased. This fact is more pronounced in a medium with glycerol. The question of preferential synthesis of ehloramphenicol-acetyl-transfcrase during the stationary phase in a rich medium is discussed.

(e) The following representation of categories of plasmids was found in 30 strains isolated from deer and hairy utility small animals (without a previous contact with antibiotics): resistance to T --10/6]2, Col factors --5/1/2, haemolytic activity --30[4/4. The results obtained extend the present view on ecology, occurrence and circulation of individual categories of plasmids in Escherichia coli, even without a selection pressure of antibiotics. The effect of the peroral application of fiavomycin on the occurrence of markers in Escherichia coli that can be determined by plasmids (resistance to antibiotics, hemolytic activity and eolicinogeny) was followed for 28 days. The following doses were applied: (a) flavomycin 10 mg/kg of diet; (b) flavomyein 10 mg/kg of diet together with the perorally applied eolicinogenie strain Eseherichia cell (a week dose of 5 \u2022 109 of Escherichia cell Ia + per animal); (c) the colicinogenic strain alone (a week dose of 5 \u2022 109 of Eseherichia coli Ia + per animal). Both experimental and control groups consisted of 25 animals. (a) In the experimental group, in which only flavomycin was added the initial 41.6% incidence of strains of Eseherichia cell with the mobile plasmid decreased to 11.2~o. The incidence of hemolytic strains of Escherichia cell decreased considerably --from 19.2 to 4%. The initial occurrence of 34.4% of the colicinogenie strains of Eseherichia cell decreased to 14.4%. (b) In the experimental group fed additional fiavomyein together with the colieinogenic strain of Eseherichia cell a considerable decrease of strains with the mobile R plasmid (from 36.8 to 6.4~o), strains with the hemolytic activity {from 18.2 to 2.0~o) but a less considerable decrease of the incidence of the colicinogenic strains (from 34.6 to 18.4%) occurred. (c) In the experimental group, in which only the colicinogenie strain of Eseherichia cell was added, the occurrence of strains with the mobile R factor varied within a narrow range (from 38.4 to 32.0%), the occurrence of strains with the hemolytic activity decreased (from 20 to 14.4%) but the occurrence of the eolicinogenic strains increased (from 28.0 to 49.6~o ). (d) In the control group the occurrence of the followed markers varied within a narrow range --the original incidence of the mobile R plasmid of 38.4~o was decreased by at most 4%, the 17.6% incidence of the hemolytic activity by at most 4% and the 30.4% incidence of colicinogeny by at most 4.2~o. The inhibitory effect of flavomycin on the occurrence of all three types of plasmids may be deduced on the basis of the results obtained. In addition, a possibility of substitution of the strains of Eseherichia cell carrying R plasmids and the Hly factor by the newly accepted strain of Eseherichia cell carrying the Celia factor can be considered. In order to determine the relative quantity of plasmid and chromosomal genes and according to that the number of copies of the plasmids in the cell, we transformed the accepter strains of Escherichia cell JC 7623 with DNA isolated from the strain 1100 R1 containing the R1 drd-19 plasmld. Synthesis of leucine and resistance to chloramphenicol were transferred as the chromosomal and plasmid markers, respectively. The accepter evils were gradually washed with 1OmM CaCl~ in the cold (0--2~ transferred to 30ram CaC12 and DNA at a final concentration of 10--20 Ezg/ml was added to the suspension of cells. The cells were sprayed on selective media and the frequency of both markers was followed separately. The frequency of transformants for the chromosomal marker varied from 1.0\u2022 10 -7 to 4.0\u2022 10 -7 9 The frequency of transformants for the plasmid gone represents 2 to 5~o of the frequency of transformants of the chromosomal gone. The frequency of the chromosomal gone. The frequency of the chromosomal and plasmid markers was roughly the same when using the accepter strain Eseherichia cell C600. Sensitivity to antibiotics of 800 strains of Shigella sonnei was tested during 1971--1972. Out of the strains 463 were resistant to one or more antibiotics. Monoresistance (TC, CM or SU) was found roughly in one half of the strains, 13% of strains were biresistant, 23% of the strains were resistant to 3 antibiotics and 14% of the strains were resistant to 4 and even more antibiotics. Types of the resistance change: whereas in 1971 strains resistant to tetracycline predominated, in 1972 the relative frequency of chloramphenicol resistant strains increased. Changes of the type of resistance could be observed also during individual epidemics, namely in strains belonging to a single lysotype and eolicin type. Conjugation experiments performed in 13.0 strains with a recipient strain of Citrobacter revealed the transferable character of the l~-faetors in 77%. Changes of R factors were detected in strains of Shigella sonnei during dysentery epidemics. These changes can occur by accepting R factors from the resistant physiological flora, or by segregation of R factors in strains that were originally resistant, leading to a complete loss of resistance. Changes can be observed both during the followed epidemic and in repeatedly isolated ShigeUa strains in individuals. A possibility of a mutual interaction between pathogens and non-pathogens is in several cases supported by demonstration of transferability of the R factors in strains of Shigella and ~Tseheriehia cell isolated simultaneously from the same person. Junkalor industrial gas analysers, adjusted for laboratory use, were employed to determine the consumption of oxygen and the formation of carbon dioxide during the synthesis of yeast biomass from ethanol. In the first phase of batch cultivation the oxygen consumption attains 1.11 g O2/g yeast dry wt., during the following phase it reaches a value of 1.76 g O2/g yeast dry wt. The formation of CO2 also increases but its increase is relatively more rapid; this is reflected in an increasing respiration coefficient during the cultivation. In the first phase the RQ is 0.28--0.32, rising in the second phase up to 0.4. Mass balance was established for both cultivation phases; it yielded stoiehiometric relationships which were found to fit the experimental data in all respects. The characteristic features of the two cultivation phases are the accumulation of acetic acid during the first phase and its subsequent consumption during the second one. This second phase coincides with increased oxygen consumption, production of carbon dioxide and the RQ .value; a calculation shows that the accumulated acetic acid is oxidized to CO2 and H~O.",

Their growth was studied at 30~ in a mineral medium with a small amount of yeast extract, NH +, and with 1% methanol. The strain yielding the highest percentage of biomass on tivation in flasks (Y 33%) was further studied as to the growth parameters and biomass composition. The biomass was found to consist of 44% crude proteins, 2--3~o esterified fatty acids, 1--2% free fatty acids, 5.7--6.0~o RNA and 0.25~o DNA. Amino acid analysis revealed a high content of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, leucine, valine and threonine. The composition of fatty acids in the cell lipids of this strain was similar to that found in lipids formed during the growth of the cells on glucose and ethanol (the strain grows better on these substrates than on methanol). The lipids contained 96% fatty acids with even number of carbon atoms and 4% of acids with odd number of C atoms in the molecule. Oleic acid was found to have the highest relative content. The suitability of application of this strain for the production of SCP from methanol is discussed. The consumption of oxygen during fermentation may be measured by balance method as the product of the air flow and the difference in its partial pressure between the fermenter inlet and outlet air stream. The content of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen was measured by gas chromatography. Nitrogen served also as an internal standard for calculating the air flow rate at the fermenter outlet as this differed from the inlet value. The example of fermentation of n-alkanes by the yeast Gandida lipolytica 4-1 served to demonstrate the calculation of the specific oxygen consumption rate in mmol/g, h and the oxygen demand per biomass unit (g O2]g biomass) obtained by dividing the former value by productivity. At initial growth stages, the specific oxygen consumption rate and oxygen demand are in a correlation with an enhanced production of fatty acids present in both the oil and water phases. At this time the biomass yield is also lower. The results of this study may serve to the optimization of biomass production. The generally low growth rates (productivities) of microorganisms growing on solid n-alkanes hint at a different type of uptake of these substrates from that found with liquid hydrocarbons. To obtain higher productivities, the solid substrate may be dissolved either in liquid hydrocarbons (n-deeane) or in highly branched inert hydrocarbons (pristane, squalane) or deparaffinated gas oil. The last technique was used for comparing the substrate specificity of two strains of Gandida lipolytica; strain 4-1, already used for preparing biomass from gas oil, and strain K capable of removing paraffin from mineral oil. The substrate was a model mixture of C10--C32 n-alkanes. The consumption of individual n-alkanes, as determined by gas chromatography, was considerably different with each of the two strains. The substrate specificity of strain K was found to be shifted to higher n-alkanes, the relative utilization of individual alkanes being also different from the strain 4-1. The results were verified with crude oil (melting point 33~ n-alkanes C8--C36). The results obtained with the utilization ofn-alkanes from gas and mineral oils (previous data), from model mixture and from the crude oil point at an adaptation of the two strains to higher n-alkanes. The substrate specificity depends thus to a certain extent on the substrate used, its spectrum of n-alkanes and the fashion and form of its application. Changes in drop size distribution are typical for the onset of hydrocarbon fermentation. Expermential data on the distribution of hydrocarbon droplets at different times during the fermentation, when plotted in non-dimensionalized plots, show that the distribution has a tendency towards selfpreservation; the non-dimensionalized plots are obtained by normalizing the distribution according to the Sauter-mean diameter. Also, the curves so obtained for different initial dispersed phase fractions and for two different kinds of substrates (gas oil and a model dispersed.phase system --n-hexadeeane dissolved in biologically dewaxed gas oil) were found to have similar shapes. Using this selfpreserving property, an empirical (signle parameter) equation was set up for the drop size distributions. The proposed empirical distribution was found to hold for different reactor sizes (working volumes of 1.5--850 1). An attempt was made to correlate the parameter, the Sauter mean diameter, with the operating conditions. The usefulness of the empirical distribution for the prediction of the performance of fermenters was demonstrated on an example. Oxygen limitation of the growth of a bacterial culture may be accomplished either by changing the partial oxygen pressure in the intake air or by altering the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (KLI) which is a function of agitator speed, aeration intensity and the physical properties of the liquid medium. Experiments were doric with the organism Klebsiella aerogenes CCM 2318 grown on a minimal glucose medium at constant pH. Oxygen supply was controlled by changing KLa; this coefficient was measured during the cultivation by a dynamic method using a membrane electrode and also calculated from both the differential and the integral form of the oxygen transfer equation. The experimental data provided a basis for an analysis of the factors affecting the accuracy of the determination of KLa by the two methods. On studying the effect of KLa on specific cell growth rate in batch cultivations the value of tz was found to be in the range of 0.68--1.1 h -1 throughout the region from anaerobic to aerobic conditions. Changes were found in biomass yield {23.4--47.3%)and in the production of acid products (difference of 26~o). Continuous cultivations were carried out at dilution rates of 0.96 h -1 and 0.178 h -1 under otherwise identical conditions. During the transition from * UNESCO Scholar, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India; ** Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT, Kanpur, India. anaerobic to aerobic conditions, the steady-state changes in biomass yields were considerably higher than with batch cultivations (9--51~o). At otherwise identical values of the physical parameters affecting the oxygen supply, a change in the dilution rate was found to bring about not only a change in the specific oxygen uptake rate, but also a change in the coefficient KLa.",

            "text": "To assess its maximum production of itaeonie acid, Aspergiltus terreus ATCC 10020 was cultivated on a glucose synthetic medium. Prolonged cultivation, especially at pH above 2.9, gives rise to a very intense growth of the microorganism on fermenter walls, above the surface of the agitated liquid. The adhesion of the microorganism depends both on its properties and on the properties of the fermenter walls. In contrast to bacteria or yeasts, the cultivation of mycelar forms gives rise not to a thin film, but to a thick layer (thickness 3--5 mm) The fermenter thus represents a continttous agitated biological reactor and, at the same time, a continuous film reactor with no regulation of the thickness of the biologically active layer. Under experimental conditions the system cannot be flushed out completely. The surface-growing microorganisms differed considerably from the actual submerged culture. The effect of dilution rate (0.2--0.4 h-l), pH (2.3--3.6) and phosphorus concentration (0.002 to 0.05% P) on the behaviour of the culture were studied. The results obtained with the wall growth differ considerably from those obtained when the wall growth was almost completely removed. A simplified mathematical model was proposed permitting the calculation of steady-state concentration of the limiting substrate in the system. The model was verified on a large number of experiments. The knowledge of quantitative relationships during the growth of microorganisms on the walls of biological reactors is of a grea~b importance for the study of the behaviour and stability of continuous cultivations, especially for the application of small-scale results on a larger scale. Experiments were carried out with 3 wine yeast strains, Saccharomyces bayanus Saeeardo 1895 (Bratislava 0 and 1), and Sac~haromyces cerevisiae (Hlirdk 1), in an automatic-intake functional fermeter model. The nutrient medium was a concentrated grape must diluted prior to the fermentation. The experiments included both continuous and period-ieal fermentations with irregular dosage. On evaluating the interrelationships between the rate of substrate consumption and biomass concentration during the propagation from an inoeulum (neglecting the effect of the alcohol formed) we found that at higher concentrations of yeast biomass the rate of multiplication declines. When taking into account the effect of alcohol (using an equation similar in form to that for noncompetitive inhibition) its inhibiting effect on the multiplication rate may be demonstrated. The appraisal of experimental data on the propagation of yeast biomass obtained by anaerobic fermentation shows that the yeast multiplication rate grows until a certain maximum concentration of the biomass is attained. A 20% replacement of the grape must by beet sugar is permissible for technological purposes. The propagation of yeast biomass on grape must is suitable only when the must is complemented by nutrients lost during the technological treatment of the concentrated must. In various fields of technology, an attention has recently centered on the application of polysaccharities produced by microorganisms and accumulated in the cultivation medium. The substrates used are for the most part glucose or sucrose which are, however, relatively expensive. As synthetic ethanol has become accessible in large amot~nts, a special attention has been paid to microorganisms capable of producing polysaccharide from this substrafe on a minimal medium. We carried out experiments of this type with nonidentifled bacteria isolated from compost soil. Cultivation conditions were tested in laboratory fermenters. Increased amount of oxygen promoted the decomposition of polysaccharides and the formation of acetic acid at later growth stages. Organic nitrogen, in the form of peptone and yeast extract, suppressed the formation of polysaecharide. In cultures without any limitation by inorganic nitrogen source (e.g. KNO3) the polysaccharide yield was half that in limited cultures even though the limitation decreased the final concentration of cells. 2% glucose yielded 0.3--0.5~o polysaccharide while 2~o ethanol gave only 0.06 --0.1 ~o of the product. Increase in ethanol concentration to 5% did not result in any increase of polysaccharide production. The highest yield was observed with 1-2 ~o ethanol. Respiratory nitrate reduetase (NR) and tetrathionate reductase (TTR) catalyse the reduction of terminal electron accepters, nitrate or tetrathionate (anaerobic respiration). The presence of oxygen both inhibits the activities of the two enzymes and represses their synthesis. We attempted to establish if a similar regulation relationship exists mutually between the two reduetases. Washed ungrowing Citrobaeter cells possessing NR synthetize TTR inductively in the presence of K2SaOe, the NR activity being not affected by this synthesis. On the other hand, the induction of NR in cells possessing TTR causes a reduction in the TTR activity. The NR induction having been completed, the TTR activity is gradually restored to its original level. If the same experiment is carried out in the presence of KCN, which inhibits the :NR activity but does not repress its synthesis and does not affect the TTR activity, the temporary decrease does not occur. If KCN is added it the moment of the most pronounced decrease, an instantaneous restoration of the :NR activity to the original level follows. If chloramphenicol is added in the same way, no activity restoration is observed. Hence, the temporary decrease in the TTR activity is due to the action of the already existing NR and not to its synthesis; protein synthesis is thus required for the renewal of the activity. The two reduetases were simultaneously induced in growing cells. While the TTR synthesis was repressed, the :NR synthesis was not influenced. In the presence of KCN, which inhibited the :NR activity, however, the repression did not occur and the two enzymes were synthetized simultaneously. Thus it may be concluded that the TTR synthesis is repressed by the activity and not by the synthesis of NR. Citrobacter was cultivated aerobically in a ehemostat at 30~ in a minimal mineral medium under the following conditions: with glucose at glucose limitation; with galactose at galactose limitation; with glucose at NHaC1 limitation; with galactose at :NH4C1 limitation. The culture was analysed in the steady state at different dilution rates D (10--85~o ~Zmax) and the following parameters were determined: growth yield K, specific metabolic rate q, intracellular concentration of pyruvate, ATP, ADP and AMP. A change in the physiology of the culture was found to occur at D = 70(~) ~Zmax and near DM; the value of K dropped, q increased, as also did the intraeelhilar concentrations of pyruvate, ATP, ADP and AMP. The reason for this was taken to be a partial uncoupling of catabolism from anabolism or a decrease in the efficiency of oxidative phosporylation. The above criteria served to compare ja culture growing with the same growth rate but (a) with D lower than D~ and D higher than DM; (b) cultures growing on glucose or on galactose; (c) at carbon limitation and nitrogen source limitation;",

During a batch cultivation the production of the speeii~c m-RNA becomes uneven, which causes a transition of the whole process to a continuous mode. The present work represents a detailed study of the effect of actinomyein D on protein synthesis and on the specific synthesis of ~-amylase, the effect of carbon source on the production of the enzyme, and the time localization of the formation of specific m-RNA and the enzyme during the population growth. The results were used for modelling a continuous process. The synthesis of exocellular protease was derepressed by transfer from a medium containing amino acids and glucose to a medium with glucose and mineral salts. The proteolytie activity was determined in the medium, in the periplasm after the conversion of the cells to protoplasts, and in protoplast lysate. 14C-Denatured protein from B. megaterium was used as a substrate. The intracellular proteolytie activity increased within 20 min after the beginning of the derepression and the enzyme activity was localized predominantly in the \"periplasm\". Simultaneously, the enzyme was excreted into the medium, its activity there exceeding its intraeellular activity 30--500 times. After the separation of mesosomes from the periplasm by centrifugation most pretense was found in the supernatant. 25--65% of the protease activity of protoplasts sedimented with the membrane fraction. Exocellular, \"periplasmic\", as well as \"protoplast\" enzyme fractions belong to neutral metalopretenses, differing from each other in the mobility during gel filtration on Sephadex column. Addition of amino acids or chloramphenicol into the medium results in a very rapid decrease in pretense activity of the cells.

The cells served for the preparation of spheroplasts that were then further fraetionated. The enzyme was then assayed in individual cell fractions. The main fraction of the EC-2 T.-asparaginase was found in the space between the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane, independently of the presence of the inductor. At the beginning of the induction, a portion of the activity was localized in the cytoplasm; in cells grown with L-asparagine this portion was four times larger than with centre cells. With proceeding cultivation the content of enzyme in the cytoplasm declined gradually to zero. The membrane fraction of cells grown with the inductor contained, at the onset of induction, up to 6~o of the total enzyme amount. With proceeding culture growth this fraction also disappeared gradually. Cytoplasmic membranes prepared from control cells possessed no aspaxaginase activity. On the other hand, a significant fraction of the enzyme was found in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic membranes of cells grown with the inductor L-asparagine. This fact indicates that these cellular structures participate in the induction of the EC-2 L-asparaginase, especially in the preparatory stage. The substrate specificity of bacterial N-phenylacetylamidohydrolase was studied by measuring the initial rates of hydrolysis of various substrates in a zero-order kinetics range. The substrates used included some N-phenylacetyl derivatives of L-amino acids, amides of phenylacetic and phenoxyacetic acids, various substituted derivatives of these amides or some other amides related structurally or chemically to the above two. When using a tohiene-treated, suspension of bacterial cells or crude enzyme preparation, significant differences were found in the ratios of initial rates of hydrolysis of various substrates, even though the enzyme is known to be localized in the space between the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane. The differences were probably due to a different rate of diffusion of individual substrates through the cell wall and, in some cases, probably also to steric hindrances. Alternately, the presence of two or more isoenzymes cannot be completely excluded. The most rapid hydrolysis by the enzyme was found with N-phenylacetylated z-amino acids. 2-Phenylbutyramide is a very poor substrate, 3-phenylpropionamide and 4-phenylbutyramide axe not substrates at all. The substrate specificity of the enzyme is discussed with respect to the ap-plication of some coloured substrates for a rapid and simple determination of the enzyme activity.",

It was proved that only ~-amylase is bound to DEAE-starch in the H+-form, gluooamylase remaining in the supernatant or the eluate. Th~ optimum pH of the enzyme solution or cultivation liquid, ensuring a 100~o sorption, was determined. The isolation efficiency was found to depend directly on the relationship activity -amount of DEAE-starch and a curve depicting this dependence was drawn. It was found to hold for both purified enzyme solutions and the cultivation liquid of A. oryzae. No effect of the medium composition on the isolation efficiency was found. The elution of ~-amylase from a column or a stationary elution has a maximum yield (50~60~o) with the solution of 0.5--0.6M l~aC1, pH gradient was not found to be suitable. 1~o complete elution of the enzyme was found. The technique may be used for the preparation of pure 0r as well as for technical preparations. The gel-filtration properties of a starch gel propared by a cold treatment of starch smear were compared with individual types of dextran gel (Sophadex). The measurement of Kay of various proteins showed that the starch gel has properties similar to the Sephadex G-50. The slope of the plot of Kay versus log molecular weights for the two gels differs only negligibly. The dependence of the flow rate on hydrostatic pressure is linear throughout the region applicable for gel chromatography and the gel is thus in this region incompressible. Attempts to immobilize enzymes by inclusion into this gel revealed that under any conditions the enzymes are eluted from it, the presence of some high-molecular proteins (glucose oxidase) preventing even the transition of starch smear to utilizable starch gel. The starch gel prepared by the above technique may be used for desalting of highmolecular substances and for gel chromatography in the range of molecular weights up to approximately 25 000.

The concentration curves of individual amino acids in the course of biosynthesis of T.-lysine were used to determine the optimum levels of the most important amino acids in the nutrient medium at time zero: aspartic acid 2.5 g/litre, leueino 1.0 g/litre, isoleueine 0.25 g/litre, threonino 0.38 g/litre, methionine 0.18 g/litre, and serino 0.7 g/litre. These data enabled us to replace the conventional nitrogen source (soybean flour) with wast~ products from other biosynthetic productions and protein wastes from other industries. The study of the properties of P. shermanii in a special semisyathotic medium at neutral and alkaline pH formed a basis for determining optimum conditions for the preparation of inoculum utilizable for enrichment of fermented milk by vitamin BI~. The strain exhibited a high growth activity even at pH 10.3, probably owing to a protective cell coat and a mucous layer which, as determined by electron microscopy, is formed at alkaline pH above 8.5. The ability of the strain to synthetizo the vitamin depended above all on the vegetative stage of the inoculum cells and on the type of microfiora in the milk starter used. The highest enrichment was achieved with inoculum taken at the logarithmic growth stage and added to a kefir starter. The resulting kefir milk was left to ripen for 24 h and its content of vitamin B12 was then 70 times that in the original milk, its absolute value being approximately 14 ~zg/100 ml. In comparison with the non-enriched product, the milk contained also some other vitamins from the B group; the level of these substances was assayed by microbiological tests. Fermented milk beverages enriched in this way are faultless as to their sensory properties and may be used mainly in children's nutrition and in various diets. Asphalts are not completely chemically defined, the most detailed information being usually their type composition. The conditions of their application are extremely variable and the spectrum of the biodeterioration agents is very broad. This hinders the development of generally applicabel methods for the determination of the biological deterioration of asphalts. The methods mentioned in the literature include mostly the determination of the rate of degradation of thin films or emulsions or the assessment of the degree of corrosion of metal surfaces protected by asphalt layers. The testing is done with either pure or mixed (accumulation) cultures. The results obtained with various methods on different asphalts are compared. The parameters studied are the rate of degradation of asphalts by mixed and pure cultures, effect of nutrients and other cultivation conditions, the size of the inocuhim and the optimum pH. The applicability of individual methods and the possibility of their unification and standardization is discussed.",

            "text": "The ageing of plastics includes mainly oxidative processes which lead to alterations in the physicochemical properties of the materials and to changes in the degree of resistance towards biodeterioration. Laboratory photo-and thermooxidative acceleration of ageing resulted, in all cellulose-containing phenol-formaldehyde moulding materials studied, in up to 90 times higher rate of colonization of the surfaces of the materials by fungi. Analogous results were obtained with oil varnishes, nitrocellulose lacquers and polyamide. With plasticized PVC. cellulose triacetate and acetobutyrate, on the other hand. an increased resistance towards the biodeterioration was found after the treatment. The measurement of conductance characteristics, permeability, water vapour sorption and electroinsulation resistance of the aged materials revealed that the decreased resistance of the phenolformaldehyde plastics is due to an enhanced rate of transport of water vapour into the materials whereas with the nitrocellulose lacquers, oil varnishes and polyamide the rate of colonization is affected by oxidation products. The increased resistance of plasticized PVC, cellulose acetobutyrate and triacetate is caused by the release of volatile plasticizing agents. The aureovocin~-producing Streptomyces aureo-]aciens, strain B-96, was found to be able to glucosidize isomeric dihydroxyanthraquinones, added to the cultivation medium, to corresponding mono-~ghicosides. With alizarine (1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone) the conversion attains 23%, with anthrafiavine (2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone) it reaches 45~o. Also, both isomeric monohydroxyanthraquinones were subjected to microbial glucosidation under analogous conditions. Though the glucosidation takes place also in these cases, the conversion is much less than with dihydrexyanthraquinones. The identity of all the products was confirmed by comparing them with authentic samples prepared chemically. The IR-, UV-and l~MR spectra of all derivatives under study were measured. Enzyme preparation with transglueosidase activity was isolated from the mutant strain Streptomyces aureo]aeien.s B-96. Partially purified enzyme was prepared by differential centrifugation, salting--out with ammonium sulphate to 50% saturation, and by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. It catalyses the transfer of glucose from the glucosyluridylpyrophosphate to 1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone, which gives rise to 1-hydroxy-2-(~-o-glucopyranosyloxy)anthraquinone. The substrate specificity and physico-chemical properties of the enzyme were studied. During the production of tetracycline antibiotics, the fermentation media are supplemented with calcium carbonate which is to maintain an optimum pI-I of the submerged medium and to bind the antibiotics formed into insoluble Ca-complexes. We tested 7 different kinds of CaCO2, both purely mineral and chemically precipitated, in order to determine the relations between their physical properties (microscopic particle size, particle shape, their conglomeration tendency, weight volume and sedimentation rate), chemical properties (purity, buffering properties, change in pI-I of fermentation medium with CaCO3 before and after sterilization), and the production activity of chlorotetracycline during the cultivation with the tested strain S. aureo]aciens. With respect to the production of antibiotics, the most suitable carbonate was the microground one (VJM) which had the production activity higher by 20Oo than precipitated CaCO3. Also, a buffering capacity test showed that this ~ype of carbonate has the lowest inflection pi point among all samples tested. The above criteria may assist in finding the most suitable type of carbonate, or a combination of carbonates, for other kinds of biosyntheses. The relationship was studied between the energy metabolism of S. aureo]aeiens and the biosynthesis of tetracyclines. The metabolic activity of a lowproduction strain of the wild type was compared with the activity of a production variant. The energy charge values for the two strains were almost identical throughout the cultivation but the low-production strain displayed an appreciably higher level of adenylates than the production variant. The total ATP-ase activity of S. aureo-]aciens increased strongly after 24 h of cultivation, i.e. in the phase when the anabolic phase terminated and ATP ceased to be utilized in biosynthetic processes. The ATP-ase activity had an identical course in both strains. The ATP-degrading enzymes were divided into two fractions: (i) a typical membrane (Mg2+)ATPase of the bacterial type, and (ii) a soluble cytoplasmic ATP-ase activity whose synthesis was repressed by inorganic phosphate. This enzyme is likely to control the level of accessible inorganic phosphate in the cell. The role of the membrane ATP-ase may be the regulation of the level of ATP in the cell and, hence, the control of its allosteric action. The structure of ribosomes from the spores and vegetative cells of S. granaticolor was studied. The spore ribosomes bind very strongly a dark pigment which is then not removable by dialysis, washing with lr~ NttaC1, sedimentation in 30% sucrose or by detergents. In the presence of 10-2~ Mg 2+ the spore ribosomes form aggregates while the majority of ribosomes from vegetative cells remain in a 70 S form. When the Mg 2+ concentration is decreased to 10-a~, both types of ribosomes dissociate into 30 and 50 S subunits. On lowering the Mg 2+ concentration as far as 10-5~ an irreversible disintegration of the subunits occurs. This phenomenon is more pronounced with ribosomes from vegetative cells. Qualitative differences between the protein composition of the two ribosome types were detected. Since the ribosomal proteins include a proteolytic enzyme and a ribonuclease which are activated during the isolation procedure, the isolation of ribosomal proteins had to be carried out in the presence of 10-a~ phenylmethylsulphonylfiuoride. During the isolation of spore r~:NA the ribonuelease activity was inhibited by diethylpyrocarbonate and bentonite in all extraction media. Two types of rRNA, 16 S and 23 S, were isolated from the ribosomes of vegetative cells and spores. The nucleotide composition of the rRNA in both de* velopment phases differed only quantitatively, no constituents other than the four major nucleotides being found.",

The main problem is the acquisition of a sufficient amount of spores for inoculation of large fermentation volumes, since each transfer into another spore generation is accompanied by a decrease in production activity. Selected variants of the erythromycine producer S. erythreus had a considerably lower production activity in 3rd spore generation whilst during a vegetative transfer no attenuation of antibiotic production was observed even after eight-reid'transfer. Mono-sporia| colonies of the strain grown on an agar sporulation medium after inoculation by spore suspension were transferred into flasks with liquid medium and cultivated for 24 h on a rotary shaker. Submerged mycelium in the logarithmic growth phase was lyophilized and kept under an inert gas. After evaluation of the seleetates by production test portions of the lyophilized young submerged myeelium were used to inoculate \"mother\" agar slopes of the 1st spore generation which, in turn, served for preparatio n of inoculuan for large fermentation volumes. The relation between the configuration and bacterial dehydrogenation of aldonie acids by active strains of bacteria of the genera Acetomonas and Pseudomor~as has, some time ago, been found to obey the so-called glueonan rule: Aldonic acid is dehydrogenated only at the second or the last-butone C atom of the sugar chain, only when the configuration at this and the neighbouring assymetric C atom is identical wi'th the configuration of the D-gluconic acid at the same site. The bacterial strains active in this respect are only those dehydrogenating D-glucouan at the corresponding C atom. Some other ketoaldonic acid were now prepared in fermentation experiments from aldonie acids or aldoses. The strains used were selected because of their high activity to D-gluconan; the C-2 dehydrogenation was carried out using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that on the last-but-one C atom with Acetomo~as oxyda~s. As the sugars used were mostly non-physiological for the bacteria in question, the fermentation liquid was supplemented by a small amount of well assimilated sugar as growth inductor. The aldonic acids formed during the fermentation of aldoscs were neutralized by insoluble carbonate. D-mannose and D-mannonan yielded thus D-lyxe-5-hexulosonic acid (5-keto-D-mannohole, 5-keto-]5-gulonic acid), D-ribonan gave as yet undeseribed o-erythro-4-pentulosonic acid (4-ketoo-ribonic acid), T,-arabinose or L-arabonan provided L-erythro-2-pentulosonie acid (2-keto-L-arabonie acid) prepared so far only chemically, and D-xylose or D-xylonan gave D-threo-2-pentulosonic acid (2-keto-D-xylonic acid) isolated so far only a dehydrogenation of D-xylose by Pseudomonas mildenbergii. All these dehydrogenation reactions are in agreement with the gluconan rule. The formation of conidia in a submerged culture of C. purpurea (Ft. Tul) was accompanied by an increased consumption of ATP, almost constant protein synthesis, constant level of orthophosphate in the myeelium, increasing activity of both intraand extraeellular pretenses and the accumulation of lipids in the mycelium. Conidiation was suppressed by ergotamine (5. 10-aM), ergometrin (5.10-4M) and glycerol (5.10-s~). Ergotamine also inhibited the activity of leucine aminopeptidase. Inhibitors of conidiation favourably affected the formation of alkaloids, the effect of ergotamine and glycerol in a mixture being synergistic. E. cell was cultivated on meat-peptone broth. In the logarithmic growth phase it was washed and transferred to sterile distilled water or sterile surface water from Danube. The cells were kept in these media for 3 weeks at 20~ under constant agitation. A conspicuous decrease was found to occur during this period in the number of cells capable of reproduction on meat-peptone agar and in the respiration and dehydrogenase activity. The decrease was deeper in cells exposed to surface water; the number of colonies determined by plating dropped to 50% during approximately 140 h while in distilled water an equal drop required 210 h. The specific respiration activity, referred to 1 mg cell proteins, was attenuated much more rapidly; in surface water cells it was reduced to 50% after eea 50 h, in distilled water after 60 h. Corresponding data for the decrease in specific dehydrogenase activity are 40 and 50 h, respectively. These results imply that (a) the sterile surface water has a more inhibitory effect on the microorganisms tested than has the distilled water, and (b) the attenuation of the metabolic functions of the cells in both media is more rapid than the decrease in reproducing ability.

The consumption of water by man, whether for personal use or in technological processes, increases steadily, with increased demands on its quality. The increased consumption is satisfied by treatment of ~he ever more contaminated surface waters; this water may mean a health hazard from the microbiological viewpoint. Microbiology is thus of a prime importance for control and evaluation as well as for diagnostic methods and quality tests. The main task, with both drinking and surface water, is the detection of total microbial colonization and, in particular, of faecal contamination including intestinal pathogens, esp. those recently recognized as harmful. The attendant problems are the indicator value, survival of the microbes and their ecology. Microbiological testing is important also with recreation-used water, e.g. in swimming pools, where the questions of occurrence and significance of some microbes (streptococci, staphylococci, candidas) and their resistance to chlorine have not yet been unambiguonsly solved. Microbiology has its say also in the problems of both streaming and accumulated surface waters and of the degradation of some foreign substances in water, e.g. pesticide residues. These aspects delineate both the present state and the perspectives in microbiology of water. In 1972--1973, a total of 135 strains of the species Sporocytophaga cauliformis were isolated from surface (Danube) and drinking (town water main I and II) water on the basis of their morphological and physiological properties. Out of 5 media tested, the best myxobacteria-retaining ability was exhibited by modified Moutonagar and the B/10 agar medium modified by us. Electron and light microseopy were used to study the developmental cycle of this species, beginning with the stage of vegetative cells without microeysts until the formation of the new generation of vegetative ceils; the cycle was found to last 8 days.

The pathogenic nature of virfises prevents their routine determination in water works. The algal viruses LPP-1, LPP-2, SM-1, discovered by Saffermann (1963), attack only some species of blue-green algae but are not pathogenic to man. As neither the algae nor the viruses are exacting as to cultivation conditions, we tested the virus as a model in water-works technology. The detection method used was that of Schneeweis and Stifter (1971) , modified for our conditions. The water sample was converted into a saline and filtered through a membrane filter Synpor 8 with a medium pore size (0.23 Ezra). The viruses were thereby adsorbed on the filter matrix and then retrieved by elution. Their cultivation and counting (in PFU/ 1 ml) were done according to Jackson and SlhdeSek (1969) : a nutrient agar was inceulated by 0.5 ml of the tested sample mixed with top agar and with the alga Plectonema boryanum. After solidification the Petri dishes were turned upside down and cultivation was carried out at constant artificial light for 4 days. During the vegetation season of 1967, the biomass of plankton bacteria was in the range of lO to 100 mg in a water column of upper area of 1 dm 2 while algal biomass was five times in excess. Only in March, after spring circulation, the bacterial biomass exceeded that of algae. In this period the bacteria die but, on the other hand, their daily production,, as determined from the rate of their growth on membrane filters, equalled or sometimes exceeded that of the algae. The highest growth rates of bacteria were determined in the periods following the peaks in algae production. The results indicate that the decisive factor for the bacteria in Che KliSava reservoir is the supply of nutrients from dead phytoplankton and that the extracellular production of the nutrients by algae is insignificant.",

            "text": "Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Prague. A significant part of the appraisal of hygienic water quality is the determination of its microbial colonization. Microorganisms take part in natural processes occurring in water and some of them may be potentially pathogenic for man. The populations of both saprophytic and some pathogenic bacteria were studied in a 15-kin section of the river Oh~e, contaminated with waste water from Cheb; the river is the source of drinking and service water and attracts increasing numbers of people for recreation. The direct drainage of untreated waste waters into the river debases considerably the quality of its water and may, from the microbiological viewpoint, mean a source of infections. The results showed that the longitudinal profile of the curve of decreasing bacterial count, especially in coliform bacteria, has the same character as the deoxygenation line. The unfavourable state of the waste waters is also indicated by the presence of Salmonellas. During the two-year observations, the percentage of Salmonella-positive findings at the outlet of the waste waters and at the end of the experimental river section was 19~o and 11~o, respectively. The results were supplemented by a study of the occurrence of alimentary infections in the corresponding district. Iron bacteria may be divided, according to the type of nutrition, to autotrophie, mixotrophie and heterotrophie, and according to morphological features into filamentous, rod-like and cocci. The diagnostics of the filamentous species, embodied in the order Chlamydobacteriales, is less complicated owing to the considerable shape variability. On the other hand, the classification of individual genera and species of the family Siderocapsaceae of the order Pseudomonadales is difficult because of the ambiguity of diagnoses of individual genera and, especially, species. A classification is therefore proposed, based on cell morphology, which would divide the genera into I. coccal forms, including genera (1) Siderocapsa, (2) Siderosphaera, (3) Siderocoecus; II. rodlike forms with a ring-shaped capsule, including genera (1) Naumanniella, (2) Ochrobium; III. rodlike forms with a capsule surrounding the whole cell, with genera (l) Sideronema, (2) \u2022erribacterium, (3) Sideromona8, (4) Siderobaeter (_~errobacillus). In the process of waste water treatment bacteria arc transferred into the atmosphere with water droplets and the sedimentation of the bacterial aerosol results in a contamination of the working environment. Quantitative determination os psychrophyllie, mesophyllie and coliform bacteria in the air of the plants was carried out using Aeroscope. Replica microbiotests served to take samples for the determination of coli --aerogenes bacteria, fungi and enterococei. Samples were taken from the rack house, pumping station, aeration tanks, biofilters, workshops, laboratories and offices. To have a standard of the degree of air contamination, samples were also taken in a place with a heavy traffic in the centre, in laboratories of a drinking water processing plant and in a wood. The effect of UV-radiation on the bacterial air contamination was studied by a Microlux; the working place was irradiated for 15 min and samples were then taken from a distance of 1 m from the radiation source. The most sensitive towards the radiation were coliform bacteria and enterococei which were almost annihilated, more resistant are psychrophyllic bacteria, mesophyllic bacteria and fungi. The effect of the radiation was rapidly abolished due to proceeding transfer of bacteria from waste water into the atmosphere and stirring up of the sedimented bacterial dust. One of the best methods for decreasing the concentration of microorganisms in the air is an effective ventilation which may reduce the number of bacteria by 50~o. The experimental values of the bacterial contamination in individual places formed a basis for a proposed system of evaluation of the life environment with respect to bacteriology.",

Heterotrophie microorganisms do not belong to a single taxonomic group; apart from fungi, oxidizing avidly NFIa + to NO2-or Nee-, bacteria and astinomyeetes form also these substances, though to a lesser extent. The capability to oxidize NH4 + seems to be possessed also by other, not yet identified bacteria and fungi. The ability of heterotrophic nitrification was tested in micromyeetes Aspergillus ]lavus Wehmer, Aspergillus ]lavua Link, Chafemium globosum Kunze and Penicillium solium Westling. All of them oxidized NHa + if grown on a medium with reduced nitrogen forms. Various amino acids and ammonium sulphate served as nitrogen sources for the formation of hydroxylamine, nitrite and nitrate. The intensity of NO2and NOa-formation depends on the species, substrate, and the C :57 ratio, which is one of the limiting factors in the release of the NHa + ions and, consequently, one of the decisive factors in heterotrophie nitrification. The course of the process is also strongly dependent on the pH of the medium, the optimum being at pH 7--9. The intensity of NHa + oxidation is not directly proportional to growth intensity. Further experiments aimed at determining the effect of some metals on heterotrophic nitrification in the above mieromyeetes and in the cell extract from Ghaetomium globosum Kunze.",

Enzyme synthesis and activity were assessed from the rate of disappearance of glutamie acid present in a nitrogen-free mineral solution inoculated by a medium preincubated with glu-77 ramie acid or with glucose. Enzymes catabolizing glutamie acid were synthetized in the medium enriched by this acid, and the glutamic acid present in the mineral medium disappeared at a constant rate. In glucose-enriched medium, on the other hand, the activity of these enzymes was low; the glutamic acid present in the mineral medium was initially utilized at a low rate, which increased appreciably after 2--3 h. The results indicated that the glucose-enriched medium allowed only very low constitutive synthesis of appropriate enzymes or that these enzymes were repressed or inhibited by glucose. The increase in the glutamie acid degradation would then be due either to inductive enzyme synthesis or to derepression. Glucose was found to repress the synthesis of the enzymes catabolizing glutamic acid and to inhibit their activity. The activity of the enzymes was also inhibited in the presence of ammonium ions; this inhibitory effect of ammonium ions decreased in the presence of glucose, and vice versa.

All fertilizing variants included also plots of black-soil fallow. The physiological utilizability of nitrogen was evaluated from the values of respirometric test, N :B, NG :G, and those obtained by eellulolytic test, CN :CB. The value N : B indicates the actual shortage of utilizable nitrogen in the soil while the quotients NG : G and CN : CB indicate its potential shortage. The physiological utilizability of nitrogen is enhanced by fertilizers, especially mineral. It decreases partially spontaneously with time, and partially due to the crop growth. The compost used prevented, to a considerable extent, the losses in nitrogen utilizability, particularly in fallow soil. The use of manure brought about conspicuous changes in the nitrogen utilization, especially in soil with growing crops. Epidermal root surface is covered by a layer of viscous material, the so-called mucigel. It is formed even on the surface of sterile roots. We studied the formation of this polymer by wheat roots during the first four weeks of plant growth in Robinson medium under sterile and controlled conditions. The dynamics of the formation of polysaceharides exuded by plant roots is similar to that of excretion of other exudates. When referred to 1 plant/1 day, the values show a decrease in the second week of growth, followed by rise in the third week which continues probably till the flowering phase. During the first week the germinating plant has sufficient energy from seed storage substances and the seeds themselves exude also a certain amount of polysaccharides. In the second week the nutrition of the germinating plant is switched mainly to photosynthesis and the amount of exuded polysaceharides declines as compared with the first week. In the following weeks the amount of exuded polysaceharides increases, amounting to 30 mg/day/1 g dry root weight, or 7.5 mg/day/1 g dry wt. of whole wheat plants. Similar values were obtained also with maize. If the nutrient solution is not replaced, the formation of polysaceharides decreases. The composition of acid hydrolysates of polysaccharides was determined by paper and gas chromatography; wheat root polysaceharides contained uronic acid, galactose, glucose, arabinose, mannose and xylose. Maize root polysaccharides contained, in addition, fueose.",

When the bacterium was artificially inoculated on bean seeds, and thus colonized the roots of germinating plants, the species P. fluorescens and some other species originally inhabiting the germinating seeds disappeared within the first month of vegetation. The concomitant decrease in the total bacterial count on the root surface was due to altered nutritional conditions in this phase and the transition from cotyledon nutrition (heterotrophic type) to leaf-and-root nutrition (autotrophie type). In the period of leaf formation the rootsurface count of X. ]uscans decreased but the total bacterial count was considerably higher. Physiological properties (e.g. nutritional requirements) of bacteria colonizing the roots after the disappacranee of X. ]uscans differed from those of the bacteria inhabiting the roots of control plants. The bacteria also decomposed polysaceharide produced in the rhizosphere by Xanthomenas cells.

In the phase of 2--3 proper leaves the above-ground parts were treated 4--5 tiines with 2% solution of urea, 0.4% Ben]ate (methyl-l(earbamoyl)-2-benzimidazole earbamate), 0.6~/o Aminex (4-ehloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid), or a combination of these compounds. Oxygen consumption was then measured in rhizosphere soils (RS) of control and treated plants 1--8 weeks after the last application. Approximately 0.2 g RS was suspended in 0.90/0 buffered :NaC1 and measured by conventional Warburg technique. The oxygen consumption in RS was 3--7 times higher than that in control soil without plants, taken from parallel pots. The respiratiort rate in RS of urea-treated plants was enhanced, the oxygen consumption during a 3-h period being higher by 50~o. In RS of plants treated with Aminex or Ben]ate the oxygen consumption fell below that found in controls. When the two agents were applied together with urea, the O2 consumption was also lower than with untreated plants. With combination urea-Ben]ate, however, the Oz consumption was higher than with Benlate alone. The bacterial counts in the RS of both treated and untreated plants were in correlation with the experimentally assessed oxygen consumption by the soil. An attempt was made to relate these results to the data on the effect of urea and pesticides on the microbial counts in the RS, with the aim to obtain a suitable criterion for evaluating the effect of pesticides on the microfiora and the treated plant. The effect of 7 strains of R. tri]olii was tested at 3 levels of mineral nitrogen (14, 70, 140 p.p.m. N) in plants of red clover by greenhouse agar tests on Jcnsen medium. The parameters tested were nodulation, rate of nodule setting and plant dry weight. With the last parameter, a significant difference was found between the nitrogen-less variant and the variants with nitrogen; no significant difference existed between the 70 and 140 p.p.m. N variants. Individual strains responded differently to the addition of KNO3; the highest plant mass yield was in a symbiosis with the strain S 190. The dose of 14 p.p.m. N increased the yield as compared to the nitrogen-less variant, further increase in nitrogen level did not affect the yield. Concerning nodule formation, a significant difference was found between the nitrogen-less variant and those with up to 70 p.p.m. The dose 14 p. p. m. had almost no effect, doses exceeding 70 p. p. m. N inhibited the nodulation. The decomposition of cellulose was studied in three variants of eleven-year-old culture after nine years of herbicide application: control without herbicides (B1), classical treatment (B2) and yearly treatment with a mixture of Zeazine and Selectine (2.5 kg/ha). In 1972 we used prcemergently a dose of 7.5 1/ha Oleogesaprine. Chemically treated variant (B3) was given 8 kg/ha Zeazine, lower since 1964 to 4 kg/ha. In 1969 the dose given to B2 and Bs was supplemented by 7 kg/ha Ramrod against Echinochloa crues gaul (L.) P. Beauv., and in 1970 by 7 kg/ha of the preparation Lasso. Fertilizing was identical in all variants. Cellulose decomposition was determined by the method of Pokorng~ and Kozovs (1965) . Prolonged application of herbicides suppressed the relative occurrence of cellulolyric microorganisms and thus also the basic cellulose decomposition. The potential decomposition of cellulose with the addition of nitrogen increased significantly during the prolonged herbicide application. The control without herbicides showed a higher basic decomposition and a lower potential decomposition of cellulose as compared with chemically treated variant. Under natural conditions, the cellulose decomposition is in a correlation with the amount of rainfall and with soil humidity.",

            "text": "The effect of allylisothiocyanate (AITC), in the form of aqueous solution or vapour, on soil bacteria, actinomycetes and micromyeetes was studied by Warburg method and by plating technique. The solution of AITC exhibited an inhibitory effect on soil microflora only at high concentrations (400 p.p.m.); this inhibition was short and was followed by a stimulation. The fungicide effects of the selution, which were observed also with lower concentrations (40 p.p.m.) were also transient. The inhibitory effects of AITC vapours, on the other hand, are more ponounced, the length of inhibition being directly proportional to the length of exposure. After a certain exposure both the physiological activity and the count of bacteria increase, this stimulation being again directly proportional to the length of action of AITC vapours. 24-h exposure to AITC-saturated atmosphere resulted in a complete abolishment of the growth of micromycetes in soil sample. This inhibitory action was permanent. Even at lower partial pressures of the AITC vapour the fungicide effect was high. At a required degree of fungicide effect, the length of necessary exposure to AITC vapour increases with increasing soil layer. Fungicide properties of AITC vapour were found also with phytopathogenic micromycetes isolated from infected plants and soil. The effect was studied of straw and pig manure on soil processes in a two-crop rotation system and in black-soil fallow. In comparison with both control variant and with variant fertilized by mineral NPK fertilizers, both the organic fertilizers enhance the respiration activity of soil and the counts of soil microorganisms. Specific mineralization intensity (referred to the number of microorganisms) decreases in the presence of easily utilizable organic substances (pig manure root exudates) and the assimilation and synthetic ability of the microbes increases. The straw brings about an immobilization of soil nitrogen and a drop in its actual and potential utilizability, especially in cultivated plots. It prevents, to a great extent, the losses of nitrogen from the fallow soil. Pig manure accelerates the dynamics of soil nitrogen turnover; its nitrogen is physiologically more utilizable than the nitrogen of mineral fertilizers. In two plots in highland meadows and one in a lowland meadow in southern Slovakia, the intensity of ammonization and nitrification was studied. The soils of the meadow phytocoenoses in question were characterized by a low level of mineral nitrogen forms. The proportion of nitrate nitrogen was lower than that of ammonium nitrogen. On applying a maximum dose of nitrogen (480 kg N/ha) it was accumulated predominantly as NOn-, especially in the period of decreased biological sorption, which indicated low utilization of this form by the herbage and by soil microflora, and a better utilization of NH4 +. After the application of nitrogen fertilizers considerable proportion of N became immobilized by soil microflora. The mineralization of organic nitrogenous substances was significantly affected by soil and climatic factors, developmental stage of the herbage and the fertilization with maximum doses. In plots with acid soil reaction the proportion of nitrified nitrogen was low and generally directly proportional to the productivity of the plots. At high levels of superficially applied nitrogen the soil reaction changed, which resulted in heavy losses by denitrifieation and volatilization. The results show that the dose 480 kg N/ha and, in arid years, even 240 kg N/ha are unsuitable. In view of the heavy losses of nitrogen by way of microorganisms, the fertilizers used for meadow eoenoses should be supplemented by compounds inhibiting the nitrification and retarding the ammonization of urea. The utilization of carbon and nitrogen from the fulvoacid (FK~) and humine acid (HKa), isolated from podzolie soil according to Roehus, by soil mieromycetes was studied. The cultures included Aspergillus versieolor, Absidia glauea, PenieiUium citrinum and P. lilacinum, all of them being previously found to utilize carbon and nitrogen uniformly from all fractions of fulvoacid. C and N utilization was determined from increased myeelium dry weight; the level of carbon and the optical density were measured also in repreeipitated fractions of humus acids. The comparison of these data with the original ones gives a fairly accurate measure of the degree of decomposition of the acids and of carbon utilization. The decomposition of the above fractions of humus acids was measured after 1 and 2 months of cultivation. The increment of myeelium dry weight was found to vary with the variant used (humus acid, C or N source) and species of mieromyeotes, no correlation being revealed between the increment and the loss of carbon from the humus acid fractions used. Total amount of FK2 decreased, during the cultivation, by 54% at most, the maximum loss of HK3 being 64%. The loss of C from FK2 after 30 and 60 days of cultivation was 10--45%, similar data for HK3 were 12--38% depending on micromycetes species. The utilization of humus acids by soil micromycetes may also be characterized by decrease in the optical density of appropriate fractions. The rabe of cellulose decomposition (RCD) was studied for several years in three different phytoeoenoses; a tight relation was found between the RCD and the type of phytocoenosis. This may be derived from the following findings: (1) The study of the dependence of RCD o~n time and phytocoenosis type as the sources of its variability in soil showed that the primary source of variability is the type of phytoeoenosis; (2) A tight correlation was found between the RCD in soil and the increasing production of plant biomass; (3) From the three soil profiles tested, 0--5 era, 5--15 em, and 15--25 em the highest RCD was found in the depth of 5--15 em, i.e. in the place of accumulation of plant root mass. The differences between RCD values obtained at corresponding soil profile depths with individual phytocoenoses were statistically evaluated; the coenoses were found to differ in the values corresponding to the depth of 5--15 cm; (4) The soil of phytocoenoses with broader spectrum of plant species gave a more heterogeneous cellulolyric microflora.",

In the terrestrial eeophase standing dead parts of main macrophytes, plant material strewn on the ground and semi-decomposed material mixed with soil were analysed. The hydrophase gave data on standing dead parts of main maerophytes, floating decomposing material, material lying on the bottom, and sapropel. All materials studied differed considerably in both chemical composition and microbial colonization. The terrestrial ecophase was characterized by mineralization of plant material, enrichment by mineral substances, especially Ca; K and P were readily released during the decomposition. The decomposing plant material exhibited a gradually increasing level of N, providing apparently conditions favourable to its fixation. In the hydrophase, the predominant process was humifieation, the level of C remaining high even in sapropel. Some accumulation of mineral materials was also observed. The level of N and P of floating material increased strikingly, probably owing to colonization by periphyton. The microbial populations in standing, decomposing and finally degraded materials differed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The most abundant ones were in decomposing materials, the poorest in the standing ones, with higher proportion of micromycetes.",

The production of CO2 during the incubation was determined. Both clays suppressed the mineralization of glucose at all concentrations~ caolinite being more effective. The oxidation at the beginning of incubation was enhanced by bentonite and suppressed by kaolinite. With rising glucose concentration the number of secondary respiration peaks increased; these peaks were entirely eliminated by the addition of bentonite. The smoothing--out of the respiration curves by kaolinite was less pronounced than with bentonite. These phenomena are explained on the basis of a different adsorption of the primary substrate and its metabolites by bentonite and by kaolinite. The droplet method was used to determine the effect of clay minerals on spore germination and sprout length of some microscopic soil fungi of the class Deuteromycetes. Both germination percentage and sprout length were affected particularly by minerals of the montmorine type, the effect being positive or negative depending on the fungal species. For instance, the presence of montmorillonite (Wyoming) caused an increase in the length of sprouts of the fungus Stachybotrys atra by 0.25% and increased the germination capacity by 6% as compared to control while with Macor hiemali, s and .Fusarium exysporum the spore germination capacity dropped by 20~/o, the length of sprouts being only 0.2 that of the control. The results indicate that the lower occurrence of some microscopic fun~, e.g. Fusarium sp., known from the literature, may be due not only to the effect of clays on soil environment, but also to a direct fungistatic effect of some clay minerals. The mechanism of this effect deserved a further study.",

Antiserum to chicken cathepsin D was prepared by a repeated immunization of rabbits with purified cathepsin D isolated from chicken spleens, whereas serum to rabbit cathepsin was prepared by immunization of sheep with highly purified preparation of cathepsin D from rabbit spleens. The activity of antisera was determined on the basis of inhibition of cathepsin degradation of bovine haemoglobin at pH 5.0 using immunoelectrophoresis with subsequent detection of cathepsin D activity using bovine haemoglobin (pI~ 3.0) as a substrate. All antisera possessed a significant inhibitory effect on the activity of cathepsin D. The most active serum inhibited completely the activity of 1 unit of chicken cathepsin in the amount of 8 ~1. One unit of rabbit cathepsin D was fully inhibited with approximately 15 [zl of specific antiserum. The fractionation of antisera on a DEAE cellulose column revealed that the anti-cathepsin D activity was localised in the IgG fraction of the serum. Rabbit and chicken PMN leucocytes were homogenized in 0.34M saccharose. The homogenate was submitted to differential centrifugation at 150, 800, 10,000 and 50,000 g.

Antibacterial activity was found in all fractions from rabbit leucocytes with the exception of the last one (above 50,000 g), whereas in chicken leukocytes, the activity was localised in the first fraction (150 g) only. The content of above mentioned enzymes in individual fractions of rabbit and chicken leucocytes was also different. Contrary to rabbit leucocytes, in chicken peritoneal leukocytes, myeloperoxidase, catalase and cathepsin E could not be detected. However, despite the absence of the myeloperoxidase system, which is one of main intracellular microbicidal mechanisms in mamals, the overall antibacterial activity of chicken leucocytes was comparable to that found in rabbit leucocytes. These findings seem to suggest the presence of more antibacterial mechanisms in phagocytes and differences among animal species, the variances being not necessarily accompanied by different final antibacterial activity.",

This phenomenon is caused by the inhibitory effect of glueocorticoids on synthesis of RNA, DNA and proteins, particularly on the RNA-and DNA-polymerase, as well as on membrane transport proteins. Lymphocytes, withdrawn from the organism in activated state (ATL), after incubation in the microehamber attached to glass and released a soluble factor which pushed off erythroeytes; thus a cell-free space -a plaque --was generated. The number of activated, plaque-forming lymphocytes was studied in guinea pigs (a) after a single injection; {b) after flve intraperitoneal injections of hydrocortisone for four and/or five days. The blood differential count and cortisol level were determined quantitatively. Thsnnus and peripheral lymph nodes of control and experimental animals wore examined histologically. After a single hydroeortisone administration, no change in the number of plaque-forming active lymphoeytes was recorded in the blood with high level of cortisol; however, the number temporarily slightly increased following the decrease of the cortisol level. After the five-fold hydrocortisone administration, the number of plaque--forming active cells did not change again during the period of high level of cortisol, however, it increased abruptly following the decrease of the eortisol level. Based on the contemporary knowledge on the biphasic respons6 of the organism to glucocorticoids, as well as on the results of our present study we may assume that the adherence, release of soluble factors (activators) into the microenvironment and the pushing off of erythrocytes, i.e. the plaque-forming capacity, do require not only the activated state of the given AT lymphocyte, but also appropriate conditions for realization of directed metabolic events (synthesis of RNA, DNA and membrane transport proteins).

DN-ase at concentration of 0.1 mg (18 U.

On the 5th and 7th day after immunization, majority of produetive plasma cells contained already rer system, which was arranged typically in dense parallel lameral tubules, filling up almost entirely the protoplasm. In addition, certain mature plasma cells contained anti-peroxidase antibodies in spherical dilated eysternae of rer, in which condensation or even crystallization of antibodies took place. On the basis of our findings we assume that the arrangement of the rcr system within the plasma cells develops from short disarranged narrow tubules found in blast elements up to dense parallel lamellae of rer in mature plasma cells or even up to the stadium of large lacunar eysternac. The occurrence of sometimes even bizarre forms of the rer system could be attributed to the specific action of mitogens used, and we consider them transitional and fully functional proteosynthetic structures which could be \"reorganised\" into an arrangement, typical for mature plasma cells. The discontinuation of the limiting membrane unit of rer during gradual crystallization of antibodies within the cysternae can be considered as one of possible modes of degradation of the rer system. The effect of intraperitoneal administration of protease peptone on the composition of peritoneal exudate of CBA mice was studied using light and electron microscopy. The enzymatic activity of cells was tested by histoehemical and biochemical assays on acid phosphatase. As compared with control animals, an increase in the number of nmno-histioeytic forms from 50~/o to 80~o was found three days after peptone injection. Besides quantitative changes, an activation of cells of the macrophage type was detected: faster and firmer adherence to glass and ultrastructural changes that are characteristic for activated macrophages, particularly the enhanced content of lysosomes in correlation to increased level of acid phosphatase. The increased activity of peritoneal cells -adherence and enzymatic activity--was also found in mice following an intraperitoneal administration of Bor-deteUa pertussis vaccine. The morphological heterogeneity of cells of the peritoneal exudate after activation with substances which influence the cells of the maerophage series is discussed as regards their origin, differentiation and functions performed by these cells. Opsonizing activity detected by intravascular clearance of bacteria in newborn precolostral piglets, and bactericidal effect to Escherichia cell 0 55 of immune pig IgM, its peptic Fab ~ and F(e)5 fragments and tryptic Fab ~ fragment were studied. Total reductmn and carboxymethylation of disulphide bonds of the immune IgM molecule completely abolished its in rive opsonizing activity, suggesting thus the importance of a tertiary structure stabilized by disluphide bonds. Tryptic and peptic Fab tz fragments differed significantly in biological activities. Unlike the tryptie Fab {z fragment, the 4,200 dalton larger peptic Fab ~t fragment possessed both opsonizing and bactericidal activity. On the other hand, the peptic :F(c)5 ~z fragment opsonized bacteria without any bactericidal effect. The possible participation of complement as well as the nature of nonspeeifie binding of the peptic F(c)5 ~t fragment to bacteria is discussed. The antibody response and immunoglobulin synthesis was studied in piglets, reared under germfree conditions after monoeontamination with gramnegative intestinal bacteria and after a long-term peroral administration of massive doses of killed bacteria. The antibody formation and immuneglobulin synthesis wa s significantly higher in monocontaminated piglets in comparison with the vaccinated group. These results are compatible with the finding that non-pathogenic gramnegative bacteria penetrate in high numbers into the regional lymph nodes which results in much higher antigennic stimulation. Using the germfree piglet model, the effect of the immune colostrum, serum and immunoglobulins IgA, IgM and IgG on the antibacterial and antienterotoxie local resistance of the small intestine to enteropathogenie Escherichia cell 0 55 was studied. The in vivo assay, ligated intestinal loop of piglets, was employed for determination of enterotoxic activity and penetration of bacteria through the intestinal wall.

The procedure includes formation of interferon in a minimal amount of serumfree medium, precipitation with zinc acetate, dialysis, centrifugation in a ionexchanger, pressure dialysis and electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel.

Liberation of interferon or an attempt to restimulate peritoneal cells was performed after their explanation in vitro.

These results support the author's view, that interferon released in the organism of mice by endotoxin, is originated from presensitised peritoneal leukoeytes. This reaction was found in lymphoeytes of all animal species tested, i.e. rabbit, mouse, man and it possessed characteristics of non-specific stimulation, comparable to the response of lymphocytes to PHA. The mitogenic effect of ET, depending on the dose used, can be inhibited specifically in viw by an induced pyrogenic tolerance to a given ET type; cross tolerance was used as an evidence that the carrier of mitegenic activity as virtually the pyrogenic exotoxin. The significance of mitogcnie activity of ET for the pathogenicity of streptococcal infections is discussed. Antibodies were detected on the basis of decrease in immunoglobulin IgG, IgM and IgA levels after absorption with purified O, Vi and H antigens. The method according to Nash and Heremans was employed. The immunoglobulln levels were determined using the IDP Sevac kit. The results showed a significant decrease of IgA in sera of typhoid carriers and of IgM in sera of typhoid patients and reconvalescents. The amount of Absorbed IgA antibodies from sera of carriers was 1.5 times higher as compared with individuals with positive typhoid anamnesis but without a carrier state. In sera of typhoid patients and reconvalescents, the IgM antibodies level was 1.5 times higher than in sera of carriers. No major changes were observed in the IgG levels. These results were confronted with the specific bactericidal activity of corresponding sera. Lipopolysaccharide antigens of four strains of NAG vihrios isolated from patients suffering from diarrhoea, and of two strains from surface water were analysed. The purified antigens formed with homologous rabbit antisera 1--3 precipitin lines. The immunoelectrophoretic patterns of these antigens differed mutually and also differred from patterns which arc typical for lipopolysaccharides of S-forms of Escherichia cell and Salmonella. The mild alcali hydrolysis of purified lipopolysaccharides altered their antigenic properties. According to altered reactions in gel, the lipopolysaceharides could be divided into three types: (a) antigens, in which determinant groups were inactivated by the mild alcali hydrolysis and therefore did not react with homologous antisera; (b) antigens, in which only certain determinant groups were inactivated and therefore yielded semiidentieal reactions with homologous antisera or formed new prccipitin lines; (e) antigens, gaining new determinants after mild alcali hydrolysis which react with homologous antisera. ~he mild alcali hydrolysis modified such antigenic determinants, in which the structure was based on 0-acetyl group and monosaccharides, bound by a alcali-labile bond. The causative agent of Q-fever, Coxiel~ burneti, is a gram-labile rickettsia. Using the methods for isolation of lipopolysaeeharide of gram-negative bacteria, we isolated from purified suSpensions of phase I a soluble antigen, possessing the serologic activity of antigen of phase I and immunogenie activity of antigens of phase II and III. The chemical analysis of isolated antigens showed that these are lipopolysaceharideprotein complexes with various proportion of these components, depending on the isolation method used. The method of isolation (extraction with trichloroacetic acid or phenol), purification, chemical composition, physieo-ehemical properties (thermostability, sedimentation) and biological properties (toxicity, pyrogenicity) showed that isolated soluble antigen of Coxlella burneti of phase I has typical properties of endotoxic lipopolysaceharide of gram-negative bacteria.",

The serological conversion was found in 23 persons with a single vaccination and in 21 with double vaccination.

Listeria complex Ei was used for sensitization of experimental animals and for liberation of mediatots of cell-mediated hypersensitivity. For evaluation of the cell-mediated hypersensitivity and immunity, method of a direct inhibition of cells of the macrophage type was employed. Groups of rabbits were sensitised with factor Ei in incomplete Freund' adjuvant (20 mg in divided doses into fore and hind foot pads). Spleens were removed 4--5 weeks after immunization. Complex Ei was added to the tissue culture medium in various amounts. The lymphocytes, present in the spleen fragments, release under the influence of antigen a number of activities; the factor inhibiting macrophage migration was chosen for our study. The degree of inhibition of migration was determined by the migration index. After addition of 100 ~tg of Ei/1 ml of medium, the values of inhibition indexes were found to be 0.67, 0.64, 0.67 and after 1 ~g of Ei/1 ml of medium, the values were: 0.80, 0.83, and 0.85. The statistical evaluation of the results revealed that values under 0.9 represent inhibition of migration. Similar results were obtained in experiments with rabbits, sensitised with Ei complex in complete Freund's adjuvant.

Antisera against isolated strains contained antibodies which were active in the homologous system, different from groups A--U. As regards certain biological properties of these strains (particularly the CAMP test), and with respect to their origin, it is necessary to differentiate them from groups B, P, U, E and Str. uberis. Alltogether we examined 41 biological and fermentative properties. For differential diagnosis, following combination of properties is important: splitting of l~a hippurate (--), splitting of aeseulin (--), growth in 4% l~/aC1 (-p). On the basis of immunological antigenic studies we assume that the isolated strains belong into a new, so far not described serological group of haemolytic streptococci.

In studies on the effect of banana in meat--peptone agar on Escherichia cell and Proteus, various effects on monocultures and on association were observed in the correlation to the concentration used. A 5% dried banana mass in MPA suppressed the growth of bacteria in monoeultures. In association, the growth of Proteu~ was significantly inhibited, whereas Escherichia cell exhibited normal growth. The described effect of banana was also studied quantitatively. If bacteria were transferred from a 8 h broth culture containing 5% of dry banana mass on MPA agar plates, no typical _Proteus colonies were observed; on the other hand, the number of colonies of Escherichia cell corresponded to that obtained in broth culture without banana. After a 24 h cultivation in broth, no growth of _proteus was observed, whereas the number of Morbidity rates for acute respiratory diseases (ARD) were analysed in seven different Railway Apprentice Centers in Czechoslovakia. The study lasted for 3 school years and covered 9,400 apprentices mostly aged 15 to 17 being based on doctors' diagnoses. The apprentices were divided into boarders and nonboarders. It was shown that ARD is the main cause of absenteeism from work and school in adolescents: it accounted for 42.5% of the lost days, whereas injuries contributed 17.1 ~ and all the remaining diagnoses together 40.4%. The attack rate in apprentices was more than double of that recorded in the Apprentice Centres' personnel. The ratio between acute tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis (ATPH) on the one hand and any other form of ARD on the other was approximately 1 : 2. Each year boarders displayed a higher ATPH attack rate than expected: life in dormitories seems to favour the incidence of ATPH as compared with other forms of ARD. It is highly probable that under these conditions the spread of beta-haemolyric streptococci is enhanced more than that of viral agents. year, we determined in 115 strains of Shigella ,onnei 12 lysotypes and 11 eolieinogenotypes. Using the combination of both methods, the number of types increased to 23. Out of these 23 strains, 39% were sensitive to drugs, 52% possessed the R-factor, 9% had a non-transferable resistance and 13% were non-colicinogenic. Furthermore, we found that the lysotype 23 (XII-) colicinogenotypo 4 (col Ib) keeps constantly in the Broumov region, probably as a carrier strain. During that time the change of the colicinogenotype to type 14 (eel Ib + col E3) to type 2 (col Is) and to further undefined type took place. In further ease, one colicinogenotype 8 (col E2) changed in one epidemic to lysotype N.C. (III-IV-VIII) probably by acquiring the l~-factor to lysetype N.C. (I-III-IV-VIII) and finally by acquisition of a col V factor to lysetype 2r",

            "text": "The genus Araehnia, represented by a single species Arachnia propionica (A.p.) is classified together with genera Actinomyees, t~othia, Bacterionema and Bi/idobacterium into the family Acti~wmycetaeeae. A. propionica is defined as a microaerophil, catalase-negative G + filamentous organism that is able to form mycelium of a transitional type. A. propionica does not split urea but ferments glucose and propionic acid and contains in its peptideglycane LL-diaminopimelic acid. A. propionica is pathogenic for man --the disease is manifested as actinomycose --and experimentally for mice. A. propionica is sensitive to penicillin. A well-documented isolation of A. propionica from such localisation which is typical for actinomyeosis, is unique in our country. In this respect, A. propionica belongs together with Aetinomyces naeslundi and Aetinomyces viscosue to mieroaerophfl actinomycotic organisms, which were reported to be pathogenic only recently and exceptionally. The proteus-like nature of actinomycosis almost excludes its clinical diagnosis. However, the aimed laboratory diagnostic shows that microaerophilic actinomycaetac participate in morbidity of our population in an unexpected large scale. Relative diffieulties which are connected with isolation and identification of the causati;ce agent of aotinomycotic diseases could be solved provided this 87 problem will be submitted to careful studies and the diagnostic will be available for all laboratories. The analysis of the mucopeptido component of the cell wall was used for differentiation of anaerobic corynebacteria and strictly anaerobic actinoraycetes. Mueopeptide of the genus Actinomyces (Actinobacterium) meyeri belongs to the lysine type with a following proportion of components in its mucopeptide: lys: glu : ala: N-ac-glN : N-ac-mur = 1.19 : 1.00 : 1.26 : 0.93 : 0.75. Mueopeptide of Corynebacterium granulosum contains diaminopimelic acid. The proportion of components of its cell wall is charactorised by following numbers: dap : glu : ale : N-ac-glN : N-ac-mur : (gly : ser) = 0.59 : 1.00 : 1.38 : 0.77 : 0.85 : (0.92 : 0.51). In the d/agnostic praxis, it is sufficient to use the method according to Park and Hancock (1960) which is based on gradual extraction of cells with hot TCA, ethanol, ethanolether and acetone and digestion of solid residue by trypsin. In case the analysed sample of extracted mueopeptide contains both diaminopimelie acid and lysine, one can presume that the presence of lysine indicates contamination of the cell wall by traces of protein. This work presents the results of electronmicroscopic studies of Mycobaeteriem emegmatis during three periods of cultivation: (1) on Youmnas medium; (2) subsequent cultivation in physiological solution or (3) cultivation in physiological solution supplemented with 1% glycerol. During the longterm cultivation, samples were withdrawn, fixed with OsO4, embedded in agar and Durcupan and ultrathin sections were prepared. The electronmicroscopic pictures showed heavy degranulation of cytoplasm and widening of the space between the eytoplasmatic membrane and outer coat in mycobacteria that were cultivated for 30 days in a nutritionally deIficient medium. On the other hand, the characteristic appearance was mainrained in the membrane structure of the eell wall, cytoplasmatie membrane, as well as in the membrane which envelops the lipid granules. In each of three mentioned alternatives, regardless from the length of cultivation, a sporadic occurrence of individuals with an unusual rough lamelar structure and dense polymorph granule in the cytoplasm could be observed. The scanning microscope showed differences in the regularity of surfaces and roughness of bacteria from individual cultivations. The pictures from the scanning microscope and the ultrathin sections revealed that the irregular roughness was in connection with the formation of giant vacuoles. It was also of interest that great irregularities of the surface were characteristic for cultures grown in physiological solution with 1~o glycerol. Cultures grown in physiological solution without glycerol had a relatively regular surface similarly as the control culture grown in complete nutrient medium. Mycobacterium smegmatis was studied in the aim to investigate their effect in biosynthestic processes. These involve proteosynthesis indicated by the rate of incorporation of leucine-14C into the TCA-insoluble fraction of cells and synthesis of nucleic acids using adenine-14C. The rate of incorporation was studied using the Merill's synthetic medium with glucose which proved to be the most advantageous for this purpose. The effectiveness of tested substances was considered mainly on the basis of changes in the rate if incorporation of precursors used, and therefore it was followed in a relatively short time interval. As the concentration dependence of tested substances was used, we could determine graphically the Ins0 value, i.e. such concentration of the substance, which was required for a 50~o decrease of the incorporation rate into corresponding macromolecules of the cell. In addition, by expressing the ratio of radioactivity of incorporated adenine to radioactivity of incorporated leucine, different data were obtained which were suitable for evaluation of the effect of the substance under study on the metabolism of the cell. From the data obtained it follows that streptomycin, gentamyein, kanamycin and r'ffampicin influenced significantly incorporation ofprecursors-14C into corresponding macromolecules in Mycobacterium smegmatis cells. The endocetlular parasitism is characteristic for pathogenic mycobaeteria. Atypical mycobacteria like Mycobacterium avium, elicit the Yersin-type of a lethal disease without typical symptoms of tuberculosis. We studied the course of infection in situ in the rabbit liver. Mycobacteria were found only within phagosomes of Kupffer cells, or eventually at later stages of infection, within phagosomes of giant multinuelear cells, which can be detected approximately in the half of the process. In the course of the process of infection, the enlargement of the volume of cytoplasm and an increase in the number of cellular organella in the Kupffer cells could be observed. The cells could be seen in vast agglomerations around sinusoids. Mycobaeteria maintained unchanged morphology and the structure of cell coats was undamaged as compared with mycobacteria cultivated in vitro. Only exceptionally lysed cells could be found. However, qnite frequently the polymorph structures occurred in the plasma of mycobacteria and phagosomes. These structures were characterisod by a high density and their morphology, size and frequency of occurrence did not correspond to volutine granules and, furthermore, they were never found in avian mycobacteria cultivated in vitro under standard laboratory conditions. Within certain mycobaeteria, and further within myeobacteria that were released into the sinusoid lumen probably by a secondary disruption of cells, vacuolisation of plasma was observed probably as a consequence of inadequate cultivation conditions. Dense structures occurred even within these cells. Presumably, we were also dealing with a regressive change which might reflect the lack of oxygen or lack of some essential nutrient in the infected tissue. Macrophages obviously lack the capacity to degrade mycobacteria. The basic chemical composition of S-and Rendotoxins (lipopolysaccharide-protein complexes) of Shigella dysenteriae 1 (Shiga), partially purified by a two-step column chromatography on Sephadex G 200 and Sepharose 4B, was studied. As an original raw extract, we used the preparation obtained by treatment of cells with hypertonic solution of NaC1 (1M) and Na citrate (0.1M) according to Reynaud. The complexes consisted of 23--35% of lipids, 40--50% of sugars and 14--24~o of aminoacids. Main part of the total lipid content formed the behenie acid 22 : 0 (about 50% for both growth forms). The value above 10~o was recorded in fatty acid 16 : 0; within the range of 5--10% were detected 14 : 0 and OH 14 : 0. None of the odd fatty acids possessed a significant per cent proportion-in the total lipid. The carbohydrate component contained following sugars: galactose (for S-30~o/for R-30%), glucose (5/35), glucosamin (10/3), rham-nose (40/0) and aldoheptose (0/25). Sixteen aminoacids were found in both forms in an identical composition; only in S-cndotoxin less aminoacids were found quantitatively. The ratio of individual aminoaeids between R/S endotoxins was maintamed within the range 1.7 \u2022 0.2. The preparation of a given purification step contained 3.8--4.8% of N, 2--3~o of P and traces of S. The kete-deoxyoctulonic acid (KD0) was found under 0.5%, 0-phosphoryl-ethanolamine could not be detected The presence of several trace elements (inorganic cations) was demonstrated in both S-and R-forms (Cu, Zn, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn). The results of the analysis of chemical composition should be taken as preliminary mean values which should serve as a guide for further steps of purification and isolation of active components of bacterial endotoxins. It turns out that the sugar ratio, which represents a different structure both quantitatively and qualitatively, is the main cause of different immunological behaviour of both types of endotoxin and therefore its immunodominant role is fully acceptable.",

On the basis of the analysis of base composition of deoxyribonucleic asld in newly isolated rickettsiae in We studied antigen-binding and antigen-inducing properties, virulence for mice and guinea pigs of strains of Coxiella burneti 48 and Nine Mile, serelogically in phase II during transfers in normal and immunologically suppressed mice. The strain 48 (50 transfers on yolk sac of chicken embryos) could be transfered in normal mice; in immunosuppressed mice it changed to phase I during 4 passages. The Nine Mile strain (an undefined number of several hundreds of transfers on yolk sac of chicken embryos) could not be transfered in normal mice, however, it could be changed to phase I during 8 passages in immunosuppressed mice. These results invalidate the hypothesis on the significance of antibodies for conversion of phase II to phase I of The virus of classical plague of fowl, strain Dobson, was grown in 10--11 day-old chicken embryos. The virus was then concentrated using the 2\u2022 zinc acetate and further purified on a DEAE cellulose. The pooled eluates were centrifuged for 1 h at 45,000 g. The sediment was dissolved in a minimal volume of 0.141~ NaC1. The purified virus (concentration 106-l07 HU/ml) was dissociated in phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, using a 2~o sodium dodecylsulphate and 1~o 2-mercaptoethanol. Eleetrophoresis was performed in 8% polyaerylamide gel. The polymerization took place in glass tubes 10X 0.6 em. Seven polypeptides could be clearly demonstrated electrophoretically in the virus studied. In some experiments, the SH groups were found to be carboxymethylated. Differences in the number of polypeptide chains were nob observed. In four polypeptides the presence of glyeoproteins could be demonstrated. The antigenic characteristic of the localisation of virus polypeptides was in agreement with data of Klenk et al. (1972) . Polypeptidos designated HA, HA1, NA and HA2 are glycoproteins, originating in the capsule of the virion. If virus was treated with bromelain, all glycoproteins were split off the virus. Polypeptides P, NP and MP were detected by polyaerylamide electrophoresis even in this case. Using the protein markers, the molecular weight of individual virion polypeptides was established; the values vary within the range 26,000 to 91,000 daltons. The origin of HA polypeptide in the virus under study and in viruses in general, is discussed. L-forms were induced by penicillin in three strains of Listeria monocytogenes out of 20 strains. These were stabilised after 5 passages on solid medium and did not revert into the bacterial form during subsequent 60 passages on media without an antibiotic. The colonies possessed characteristic morphology of L-forms. They were osmotically labile, did not grow at :NaC1 concentration below 1.5%. They required at least 1~o of native serum, the optimum concentration being 10%. All strains produced weak haemolysis in a blood-containing me-dium similarly as original bacteria. In the liquid medium, the L-forms grew in the form of a fine sediment. The growth of colonies on solid medium was inhibited by antisera against L/ater/a monocytogenes. L-forms are highly resistant to antibodies influencing the synthesis of the cell wall, however, to antibodies, which inhibit proteosynthesis, they arc more sensitive than bacterial forms. A number of properties of mycoplasmatales viruses belonging to types MV-L2 and MV-Lg-L 172 were found to be identical to thos~ of myxoviruses and kindred animal viruses which indicates the relation or identical origin of these groups of viruses. The properties are: (1) structure ~of particles, containing nucleic acid enclosed in the three layer lipoproteinic, biological unit-membrane; (2) heterogeneity in the size of virus particles; the particles are not rigid but rather of pliant consistency;",

Since mycoplasmas themselves are close to mammalian cells as to surface structure and they are elementary self-reproducing microorganisms, parasiting in plant and animal tissues where they can live together with their viruses, in many cases inside the cells, it is possible that these viruses could get adapted to the host cells of higher organisms or the viruses of the~ organisms could be taken over by royceplasmas. The former of the two possibilities is very probable in view of the relation of the morphogenesis of these viruses to the characteristic features of mycoplasmal structure and development. The difference in the nucleic acid type of globular viruses of mycoplasmas hitherto described and of myxoviruses cannot be explained on the basis of present knowledge of mycoplasmatales viruses, but a number of processes arc l~mwn which could take part in this conversion and the similarity of other properties of these viruses shows their obvious relationship. Antibody inhibition of neuraminidase activity was studied by using influenza A virus recombinants containing haemagglutinin and different neuraminidase subtypes. Neuraminidase was inhibited in every case tested, even when hyperimmuno serum containing antibodies only to the relevant haemagglutinin was used. This steric inhibition of virus neuraminidase was not observed if the inhibition test was carried out in the presence of a non-ionic detergent (Triton-X-100), however. Inhibition of neuraminidase by serum containing antibodies to the neuraminidase in question was not influenced by the presence of Triten-X-100. The use of Triton-X-100 allows very simple and quick detection of sterie inhibition of virus neuraminidase by antihaemagglutinin antibodies.",

We tested this method, using RDE cholera filtrate preparations (Czechoslovak and foreign produced) and recent and prototype strains of influenza, parainfluenza and parotitis virus. We found that crude cholera filtrate preparations did not adequately remove nonspecifie inhibitors of recent, epidemiologically important, influenza A virus strains and that semlpuritled RDE preparations (RBC eluates) were needed. Czechoslovak preparations were more potent than those produced by Messrs Duphar (Holland); they reliably removed nonspecific inhibitors without significantly impairing specific antibodies. The RDE preparations were produced, in principle, according to the method of Burner and Stone, using developing chick embryos for the propagation of V. choleras and all-glass G5 filters for filtering the cleared allantoic fluid. The enzymatic activity (neuraminidase content) and RDE titre of the preparations and their ability to destroy inhibitors in standard sera were tested. The RDE preparations were supplied to Czechoslovak virology laboratories, ust~lly in the lyophilized form. Another final way of preparing RDE was also tested. In this, the preparation was dried by atomization and the resultant powder was compressed into dry tablets. This is an international innovation and it has several advantages over the lyophilized form. The distribution of the virus particle and of its antigenic components was studied in virus preparations from embryonic mouse brain tissue by zonal centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient, by electron microscopy identification of the resultant fractions and by serological tests. Strain OC 43 v'irions were found in the 1.16 density zone. Haemagglutinating activity was associated mainly with complete virus, whereas complement-fixing activity was found in the ribosomal fraction (sp. density 1.14). Conditions for storing the isolated fractions so as to preserve their biological activity were determined. During an epidemic caused by type A2/Hongkong and A2/England influenza virus, the authors systematically examined postmortem material from 9l subjects who died during an acute im~luenza infection. In fve, they demonstrated influenza virus in organs other thaw those of the respiratory tract (heart, liver, spleen). These were all subjects with lowered resistance: three were over the age of 70, one was a young woman who had given birth five days previously and one was an infant aged four months.

It was found that: (1) The outer envelope of virus particles in the cytoplasm canals and the extracellular space has a distinct membrane unit structure and processes or globular formations on its surface, while the envelope of intranuclear particles and particles in the perinuclear cisterna consists of only a single dark layer.",

These results are in agreement with the concept that large protein molecule precursors are synthesized in influenza virus-infected cells and that they are then broken down to virus structural proteins by proteolysis. The influenza virus envelope proteins contain a large quantity of eysteine residues and the effect of S-methyl-L-eysteine on the replication of influenza virus was therefore tested. Influenza virus replication was found to be inhibited. The influence of temperature on the stability of the neuraminidase of influenza virus replicating in the presence of S-methyl-L-cysteine and on control virus neuraminidase was also compared. The cysteine analogue was not found to have any effect on the thermostability of neuraminidase.",

Hydroxylamine, the monofunetional alkylating agents ethylmethane sulphonate, 2-chloroethylamine and N,N-dimethyl-2-chloroethylamine and the bifunctional agents ypenyl and mitomycin C were used for testing. Several nitrofurans, sugar analogues and microbial metabelites were also employed. The lysogenic strain E. cell C 600 lambda was used to study the inductive effect of the substances. Phage inactivation was studied in phage lambda cb2. In both cases the indicator organism was E. cell C 600. An inductive effect was manifested in an increase in the number of plaques, an antiviral effect in a distinct decrease in the number of plaques in the diffusion zone of the substance. None of the three monofunctional alkylating agents was found to influence prophage induction. With the two bifunctional akylating agents, induction occurred in both cases. Some of the other test substances also had an inductive effect, but it was significantly weaker. 2-ehloroethylamine and some sugar analogues, nitrefurans and microbial metabolites displayed an antiviral effect. The electrophoretic profiles of the doublestranded RNA formed in large amounts in nonpermissive host bacteria infected with phage f2 sns 11 were determined. Short-term labelling at different intervals of the defective replication cycle shows that the molecular weight of the newly formed RNA is not progressively reduced, but that the dnuble-strandcd RNA formed soon after infection is progressively degraded to low molecular weight fragments. On using a strain deficient in RNAse III, which specifically breaks down double-stranded RNA, degradation does not occur and an intact replicating form is obtained. The results show that the greater part of the hyperproppced complementary RNA already forms a bihelical structure in the cells, i.e. prior to isolation, so that it loses its template function and undergoes gradual degradation by RNAse III. Only a small portion of the RNA keeps its monohelical-stranded structure and template function. This part of the RNA does not undergo intracellular degradation.",

The mutant was localized by means of crosses in the zone between the genes cII (the gene for the represser) and ci (the gene for the activator of the repressorl. This mutant, like other, similar, independently isolated mutants, is remarkable in that it produces phenotypically virulent mutants capable of vegetative growth on lysogen LT2 (L) with relatively high frequency. The nature of the other mutation leading to virulence has not yet been determined. According to the fregueney of back-recombinations, it is likewise in thB \"c\" zone of the phage chromosome, however, \"Virulent\" mutants are complementary with ci and clix mutants. The initial B 14 mutant is capable of lysogenizing an infected cell. Some of the resultant lysogens are defective. The biological effect of o-methylhydroxylamine (OMHA)-modified adenine on phage T4 was studied by means of a non-sense phage T4 mutant. The rate of OMHA modification of adenine was 50 to I00 times lower than the rate for cytosine. Modified adenine derivatives display very low activity in the RNA-polymerase system and their biological activity is therefore presumably also low. In the ease of phage T4, however, study of reversions of amber and ochre mutants shows that OMHA also caused type A--G transitions. Unlike other systems, this transition accounts for a relatively large proportion of the total mutagenic effect of OMHA on phage T4.",

MI-KVLIK, Research Institute of Antibiotics and Biotransformations, Roztoky near Prague; Institute of Microbiology, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, Prague.The biosynthesis of ehlorotetraeycline (CTC) byStreptorayces aureo/aciens is eontroled by a certain concentration of chloride ions in the medium, e.g. by 0.02~ Ntt4C1 which is fed into the medium between the 40th and 50th h of cultivation. The production of the antibiotic attains 10--1 ~ nag CTC/ml medium (CS PV 337-73). Alkali metal chlorides (Na, K, Ca) do not affect the chlorination of the perhydronaphthacene ring and the amount of CTC corresponds to 85--95%. Another group of chlorides [Mg, Co, Mn, Fe(III)] suppresses considerably the activity of the ehlorination process and the level of the antibiotic is reduced to 40 to 60~ with a eoncomitant high proportion of tetraeycline and its epimers. Application of chlorides[Co, Mn, Fe(III)] at the onset of cultivation results in an inhibition of the synthesis of the enzyme catalyzing the chlorination of perhydronaphthacene. The amount of CTC corresponds then to 20--50~ . Some chlorides (Ntt4C1, KC1, LiC1) abolish the inhibitory effect of the Co, Mn and Fe(III) salts on the synthesis of the enzyme. The results indicate the regulatory function of chloride ions in the synthesis of the enzyme participating in the chlorination of perhydronaphthaeene.73Energy Charge and the ATPase Activity in Streptomyces aureofaciens.

Two methods were used. The first method is based on the ability of fluorescing Pseudomonas cells to utilize pipecolie acid. Diluted suspensions of rhizosphere soil or root washes were inoculated in to a medium containing mineral salts, glucose and 0.1~o pipecolie acid. After 14 days of cultivation at 27~ the level of pipeeolie acid in the medium was assayed. Its disappearance indicated the growth of microorganisms utilizing it. The results of the test were quantified by means of probability tables. The second method makes use of the antibiotic-resistance of Pseudomonas cells. A medium according to Simon, Rovira and Sands was used in which novobiocin was replaced by erythromyein. Both methods were used simultaneously in a number of pot experiments. The results, completely compatible, showed the changes in the number of the bacteria in the rhizosphere of inoculated plants. Strains of Pseudomonas ~utida are capable of surviving and multiplieating in the rhizosphere of bean plants, wheat and cucumber. These strains affect favourably the growth, development and health condition of the plants.

            "text": "The effect of UV radiation on the repair capacity of the host cell and bacteriophage was studied. The sensitivity of E. cell cells to the effects of UV radiation depends on the repair and recombination capacity of the cell and is influenced by UVr and roe genes. Bacteriophage repair capacity is closely associated with the genetic properties of the host cell. The significance of UVr and rec genes in the repair of bacteriophage after exposure to UV radiation was studied. Repair of bacteriophage by the host cell depends on the host gone UVr B; the rec A gone is of no significance for the course of repair. The results indicate that mechanism of lambda bactermphage repair by the host cell consists in the breakdown of phage DNA dimers. UV reactivation of bacteriophage requires the host roe A gone. Genes for excision repair are probably not needed for this repair.Host Specilicity o/Phages P22 and L. L. So~xovl, Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Pur-kyn~ University, Brno.The Samo~ella typhimurium phages P22 and L differ (among other things) in respect of their host specificity; strain LT2 is the host of phage P22, while the host strains of phage L are LT2 and 1559. The difference is not determined by modification of phage DNA by the host (the host conversion mechanism). Phage L mutants incapable of vegetative growth on a P22 host were found. These were divided, by complementation tests, into 3--4 groups. The mutants in the first group belong to the first of the series of genes controlling synthesis of the phage head, but do not possess phage P22 specificity. The second group was allocated to one of the genes for synthesis of the tail controlling adsorption to the host. These mutants likewise do not possess phage P22 specificity. Only the last group of mutants displayed phage P22 specificity in complementation. These mutants were localized by means of two-and three-factor croses in the im~aediate vicinity of gone tin. In addition, it was found that some \"clear\" type tin L genes had similar limited capacity for vegetative growth on a strain 1559 host and that the adjacent regulative gone for DNA synthesis in phage P22 and L was non-homologous. Lysogenization by phage P22 is controlled by the genes Cl, c2 and c3 (the immC zone) and the ely gone. C1 and c3 function are essential for the institution of lysogeny, c2 function for its perma-nent maintenance. Cly function acts counter to the establishment of lysogeny. The interplay of immC and ely helps to decide between lysis and lysogenization. The elimination of ely mutations leads unequivocally to lysogenization. We found that mutations leading to suppression of a defect in ely function exist. They were characterized eomplementationally, physiologically and genetically as promoter mutations. In this way we functionally defined a pro promoter for left-sided transcription of genes cl and c2 en bloc. (We presume that transcription on the left continues from a further pro-mo~er, vx.) Another promoter, prm, defined by K5 mutation, promotes only c2 transcription, in the same direction. We submitted a transcription regulation model for the immC zone, in which we assume that the prm promoter also determines transcription in the opposite direction (transcription of early phage functions). We further use the same model to explain the development of virulence in phage P22 as constitutive bilateral transcription from vx and K5. Clones able to grow normally at the inducing temperature were isolated from a heat-inducible E. coli reeAlysogen (Xintsc]857). The inability of the derepressed prophage to express its lethal functions is due neither to a genetic defect in the prophage, nor to mutation of its host. Two types of such heat-resistant clones, corresponding to different phage regulation patterns, have so far been defined (El and E2). E1 type bacteria do not support the growth of homoimmune phages, including Xvir, and their capacity for reproducing kcl7 and Xi434 is diminished, but they are completely sensitive to Xi21. E2 type bacteria are also insensitive to superinfection with homoimmune phages fully susceptible to X-specific negative regulation (cI, tof), but the constitutive mutants Xvir, Xv2, kvlv3 and Xcl7 and the heteroimmune phages Xi434 and Xi21 grow normally in E2 type cells. E1 and E2 types also differ in respect of their prophage gone activity; in E2, expression of the left opcron early gone N takes place, whereas 1W gene activity is absent in El. On the other hand, in both E1 and E2 cells, the right opcron early genes of their prophag~, cII, O and P are expressed, while the genes of the prophage immunity region, cI and rex, are not. This contrasts with the normal lysogenie state (corresponding to the parental type PA), when only the prophage immunity zone is active. The characteristics of E1 and E2 clones are unstable hereditary features: reciprocal transitions occur in aging cultures or in bacteria starved and kept in buffer. The frequency and the direction of these transitions depend upon the history of each clone. It is also influenced by the temperature at which the non-growing populations are kept. Lysogenic bacteria containing a doubly defective prophage ()~:N-P-) non-lethal for its host were tested for their ability to promote growth of a superinfeeting :~phage at various intervals after UV irradiation. Two successive processes ensued. During the ~irst 20 minutes after irradiation, immunity to superinfection was lost; afterwards, 70~o of the cells regained it, while the rest remained non-immune. The decision of each cell was transmitted to its progeny and became a hereditary character. Superinfection of the irradiated cells with a homoimmune phage prevented postirradiction loss of immunity. This was not due to the cI product (immune substance) added by the superinfecting g~nome, since a similar effect was observed when the superinfeeting phage was cI-().c~ sus 10). If the defective phage was cII-()~N-cII-P-), immunity was lost more slowly (it took 30 rain for the whole population to become non-immune), but immunity was not regained. The cII gent thus seems to play an ambivalent role in the regulation of immunity: immediately after irradiation it promotes loss of immunity, but at later intervals it promotes its reestablishment.",

Of these, only two alternative states, representing preponderance of either the represser or the antirepresser, are final and stable. The other states are equilibrial and form dynamic cycles. The introduction of probability functions into the fourequation system showed that equilibria1 states are labile and are transformed to modified final alternative states after a given number of cycles. On using further probability functions, alternative states occasionally change from the one to the other and back again, thereby modelling, for example, the phasic transitions of imm + to immlysogens described by Ncubauer. The process of cell differentiation can be modelled on the same principle.",

These relationships can be expressed by mathematic logic symbols, using logical functions of negation, conjunction, disjunction, etc. The allosteric inhibition system and the repression system are simple cases to which the above relationships can be applied. In biological material in which gene functions and products and the regulative relationships between them axe relatively well known, modelling by means of a logical grid can be used instead of the usual modelling of the topological relationships between the elements of the system, and the relationships within the functional subsystem can be expressed in terms of Boolean algebra. The interactions of genes and their products within the logical grid are of a dynamic character and they can be modelled as an abstract automatic system progressively acquiring a given number of defined states. Intermediary states are either of a cyclical character, or, after a given number of steps, they lead to the absorbing, final state. Part of the regulative system of lambda phage is given as an example. The situation calculus language L we use consists of three types of variables, unitary and binary predicates, binary relations, quantifiers and the usual logical connectives. In general, any system of regulation at transcription level can be interpreted as a structure of L. Compared with \"weaker\" calculi, e.g. Boolean algebra, etc., the situation calculus is less operable. On the other hand, it has the advantage of being suitable for an easy intuitive interpretation of formal results. It further allows any arbitrary initial conditions to be set. It is thus a uniform method for describing and studying both normal and defective genetic systems at each step of the regulation process and even permits analysis of the properties and behaviour of theoretically constructed regulation states. The heuristic volue of the situation calculus can be seen particularly in the possibility of studying and formulating the most general features of gene regulation at purely 96 syntactic level, without encumbrance by the semantical aspects of the terms (i.e. their biological, biophysical or mechanical meaning or spatial interpretation). In this way, general axioms were for-mulated, such as the axiom of Vitality, the Monot ony and the Production axiom and so on, which reflect the formal principles on which the con temporary concept of genetic regulation is based.",
