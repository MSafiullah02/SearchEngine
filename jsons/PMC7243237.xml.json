In certain situations such as uncontrollable haemorrhage, infected injuries posing a threat for further spread, orbital trauma with progressively reduced visual acuity and any injury posing a threat to the airway must and should be addressed.2 Also, while we might be deferring cases to be dealt with at a later date, the patient should, at this very stage be counselled regarding any functional impairment which might be experienced in due course of time and a possibility of performing deformity correction at a later date.
