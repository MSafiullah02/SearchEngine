High-fat/high-sugar western diet and less physical activity of the modern life style result in higher energy intake and lower energy expenditure. Obesity can lead to kidney injury in addition to hypertension. The mechanism underlying the development of obesity associated hypertension is as follows: (1) physical compression of the kidneys by intrarenal fat and extracellular matrix; (2) impairment of pressure natriuresis; (3) renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) activation; (4) increase in the activity of sympathetic nervous system; (5) insulin resistance; and (6) leptin, and other neuropeptide dysregulation [2, 3]. Individuals with obesity are often reported to have increased plasma renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activities, plasma angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin II (ANG II), or aldosterone levels [2, 4, 5].",

During human pregnancy, if preterm delivery is expected, glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is given to stimulate the development of the fetal lungs and decrease the postnatal mortality and morbidity [7\u20139]. Overexposure to GC has been observed in conditions of prenatal stress, which can lead to the developmental programming of metabolic syndrome and hypertension in later life [10\u201313]. Our previous studies support these adverse effects of prenatal GC over-exposure during fetal development [12, 14\u201317]. We also showed that dexamethasone (DEX) treatment during pregnancy enhances the susceptibility of the offspring to postnatal HF diet-induced programmed hypertension [18]. The causes for the induction of hypertension by prenatal DEX may include a decrease in the number of nephrons and altered levels of luminal ANG II and sodium transporter [13, 19, 20].",

            "text": "The RAS is classically considered to play a key role in regulating blood pressure (BP) as well as maintaining water and sodium balance. The juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney converts prorenin into renin, which is then secreted into circulation. Plasma renin converts AGT into angiotensin I (ANG I). ANG I can be further cleaved by angiotensin-converting-enzyme 1 (ACE1) to yield ANG II. ANG II exerts its effects via binding to the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and ANG II type 2 receptor (AT2R) [21]. Regulation of RAS is also influenced by other RAS members, such as ANG-(1\u20137) [22]. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homolog of classic ACE1 forms ANG-(1\u20137) directly from ANG II and indirectly from ANG I. Mas receptor (MasR) is the ANG-(1\u20137)-specific G-protein\u2013coupled receptor [23]. The ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MasR axis functions against the vasoconstrictor, proliferative, and lipogenesis effects of ACE1/ANG II/AT1R axis [24]. In addition to BP regulation, RAS is involved in other physiologic and pathophysiologic processes such as growth and inflammation, and involved in glucose and lipid metabolism [21].",

In rodent models, up to 30% of the systemic circulating AGT level was contributed by the adipose tissue [26]. An earlier study showed that in subjects with obesity related hypertension, AGT gene expression in adipose tissue was increased and plasma AGT levels were elevated [27]. In this study, we investigated the effects of prenatal DEX exposure and post-natal HF diet on RAS signaling in adipose tissue. We found prenatal GC exposure altered the ACE1/ANG II/AT1R axis, whereas postnatal HF diet negatively impacted the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MasR axis. Thus, prenatal DEX exposure and postnatal high-fat diet exerted a synergistic effect on blood pressure elevation through a distinct programming mechanism of systemic and adipose RAS.",

(Taipei, Taiwan), housed and maintained in a facility certified by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. The study protocol was described earlier [28]. In brief, the virgin SD female rats were allowed to mate with male rats for 24 h, and were then separated from the male rats and housed individually in standard plastic home cages. After confirmation of pregnancy, the pregnant female rats were randomly assigned to two groups: the vehicle group and dexamethasone exposure group. The animals in the dexamethasone group were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 mg/kg/day dexamethasone every day from the gestational age of 14\u201320 days. The vehicle group received daily intraperitoneal injections of normal saline during the same period. The subjects from litters of eight pups were standardized with respect to the quantity of milk they received and maternal pup care after birth. The offspring were allowed to stay with the mother until weaning. Pups were weaned 21 days after birth and placed in cages in groups of three until testing in adulthood. Since hypertension occur at a higher rate than females, we elected to study only male offspring [29, 30]. The male offspring were then divided into four groups: the VEH group, prenatal DEX exposure group, postnatal high-fat diet group (VHF), and prenatal dexamethasone exposure with postnatal high-fat diet group (DHF) (n = 8\u201310 for each group). VEH and DEX groups received control diet (protein 23.5%, fat 4.5%, crude fiber 5.0%, crude ash 7.0%, and water 13%, Fwusow Taiwan Co., Ltd., Taichung, Taiwan) after weaning. VHF and DHF groups received a HF diet (58% high-fat diet, Research Diet, D12331) from weaning to 6 M of age.",

Rats were euthanized using xylazine (50 mg/kg; Bayer, Taipei, Taiwan) and zoletil 50\u00ae (25 mg/kg; Virbac Laboratories, Carros, France) at a 1:2 mixture by intramuscular injection, followed by cardiac puncture and saline perfusion [28, 32]. Heparinized blood samples were collected at the time of euthanasia [28]. Four regions of adipose depots were carefully dissected as described earlier [33]. In brief, first, the epididymal depot was separated by a horizontal cut above the epididymis, just distal to the major blood vessel in the base of the pad. Second, the retroperitoneal depot was recovered by first separating the perirenal fat and then dissecting the entire retroperitoneal pad as a triangular section extending from a vertex in the inguinal region up the midline and across at the lower pole of the kidney, extending laterally as far as fat was visible. Third, the mesenteric depot was harvested by cutting the intestine below the duodenal-jejunum junction and stripping the fat by gently pulling the intestinal loops apart. Fourth, the retroperitoneal depot was dissected out, laying the animal first on the left and then on the right side. Lateral cuts were made through the skin from the top of the buttock to the base of the ear to reveal the underlying fatty layer. At approximately halfway point of this cut, lateral cuts were made into the fatty pad, following the line of the previous skin incision. Next, a cut was made through the skin just below the rib cage across the dorsal surface linking the two lateral incisions. The rectangular flap of skin was then carefully separated, leaving the subcutaneous pad intact. The pad was then carefully dissected away from the underlying muscle and fascia. The weights of retroperitoneal, epididymal, mesenteric and subcutaneous fats were recorded. Because visceral or retroperitoneal fat is a better predictor of increased BP than subcutaneous fat [34] and retroperitoneal fat has been reported more correlated with metabolic profiles than other fat depots [35]. Thus, retroperitoneal fat was chosen for further RT-PCR studies.",

            "text": "We next analyzed the effect of prenatal DEX exposure and postnatal HF diet on the expression of RAS signaling genes. Many studies have shown that the expression of common reference genes varies with tissue type and physiological status [36]. In order to find a reliable reference gene for mRNA expression analysis, we investigated the expression of cyclophilin A, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein L17, \u03b22 microglobulin, and \u03b2-actin mRNAs. We found that GAPDH showed less variation than the other reference genes in rat adipose tissue (Additional file 2: Figure S1). Therefore, we used GAPDH as the reference gene in subsequent studies. As shown in Fig. 5a, prenatal DEX exposure suppressed the expression of AGT gene (0.60 \u00b1 0.15-fold relative to the VEH group), whereas the VHF group showed increased expression of AGT mRNA in rat fat tissue (2.61 \u00b1 0.75-fold relative to the VEH group). Two-way ANOVA revealed significant main effects for Hit 1 [F (1, 20)  =  9.51, p = 0.006] and Hit 2 [F (1, 20)  =  16.33, p =  0.001] but without significant interaction between Hit 1 and Hit 2. This result indicated that these two factors acted independently. In contrast to the effect on AGT mRNA, prenatal DEX exposure and postnatal HF enhanced and suppressed prorenin receptor mRNA expression, respectively (DEX vs. VEH, 1.44 \u00b1 0.16-fold; VHF vs. VEH, 0.79 \u00b1 0.13-fold) (Fig. 5b). Two-way ANOVA revealed significant main effects for Hit 1 [F (1, 20)  =  5.31, p = 0.032] and Hit 2 [F (1, 20)  =  11.68, p =  0.003] without significant interaction between Hit 1 and Hit 2. The effect on the expression of renin mRNA was like that of prorenin receptor mRNA. Prenatal DEX exposure and postnatal HF enhanced and suppressed renin mRNA expression, respectively (DEX vs. VEH, 1.47 \u00b1 0.07-fold; VHF vs. VEH, 0.82 \u00b1 0.08-fold) (Fig. 5c). Two-way ANOVA revealed significant main effects for Hit 1 [F (1, 20) = 14.20, p = 0.001] and Hit 2 [F (1, 20) = 15.62, p = 0.001] without significant interaction between Hit 1 and Hit 2. Regarding mRNA expression of ACE1, there was a significant effect of prenatal DEX treatment [F (1, 20) = 7.11; p = 0.015; Fig. 5d], but no effect of postnatal HF was observed, and there was no interaction. In contrast, mRNA expression of ACE2 was significantly affected only by postnatal HF [F (1, 20) =41.92; p < 0.001; Fig. 5e], and no effect of Hit 1 or interaction of the effects were observed. There was no effect of either prenatal DEX exposure or postnatal HF on AT1R mRNA expression and there was no interaction of the effects (Fig. 5f). Two-way ANOVA between groups showed a significant main effect only for postnatal HF but not prenatal DEX exposure on the expression of AT2R mRNA [F (1, 20)  = 33.70, p < 0.001; Fig. 5g] without Hit 1/Hit 2 interactions. Similarly, in the case of MasR mRNA expression, only the effect of postnatal HF was significant [F (1, 20) =37.21; p < 0.001; Fig. 5h], but no effect of prenatal DEX or interaction of the effects were observed. Thus, prenatal DEX exposure and postnatal HF diet influenced the gene expressions of prorenin receptor, AGT, and renin of adipose tissue in an opposite direction, although both prenatal DEX exposure and postnatal HF diet cause elevation of systolic BP.",

Both prenatal GC exposure and postnatal HF diet had an impact on systolic BP. In the case of plasma RAS peptide levels, prenatal GC exposure suppressed plasma ANG I and ANG II levels. Postnatal HF diet led to the suppression of plasma ANG-(1\u20137) level but did not impact ANG I and ANG II levels. Prenatal GC exposure enhanced the mRNA expression of prorenin receptor and renin and suppressed the mRNA expressions of angiotensinogen and ACE in adipose tissue. In contrast, postnatal HF diet upregulated the expression of the angiotensinogen mRNA and downregulated the expression of prorenin, renin, ACE2, ATR2, and Mas mRNAs in adipose tissue. We found prenatal GC exposure alter the ACE1/ANG II/AT1R axis, whereas postnatal HF diet negatively impacted the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MasR axis (Fig. 6). Thus, prenatal DEX exposure and postnatal HF diet had a synergistic effect on the elevation of BP through a distinct programming mechanism of systemic and adipose RAS.",

Adipocyte AGT deficiency has showed to prevent high fat-induced plasma ANG II and systolic BP increase in mice [43]. These results demonstrated the contribution of adipose derived AGT to BP regulation.

Postnatal HF diet can increase the number of pro-renin receptor expressing cells in adipose tissue in rats [46]. Our results from postnatal HF group agreed with these reports. In our study, postnatal HF diet increased AGT mRNA in the adipose tissue weaned onto a HF diet. Furthermore, decrease of ACG2 mRNA and plasma Ang-(1\u20137) were also observed in our study. ACE2, which is the enzyme that cleaves ANG II into Ang-(1\u20137), protects against HF diet-induced insulin resistance in mice [47, 48]. In one study on mice fed with HF diet, adipose expression of ACE2 mRNA increased [49]. But we found that the expression of ACE2 mRNA in retroperitoneal adipose tissue decreased with long-term HF diet in rats. However, these results demonstrated that the expression of ACE2 in adipocytes was dysregulated in subjects fed with HF diet. Since Ang-(1\u20137) is cleaved from ANG II by ACE2, the decrease of plasma Ang-(1\u20137) in postnatal HF group may partly due to the less expression of ACE2 mRNA in adipose tissue.",

In our study, prenatal DEX treatment resulted in BP increase, but a decrease in plasma ANG I/II compared to that in VEH group.

The role of local RAS in prenatal GC exposure related hypertension should also be considered. There are very few reports on the effect of prenatal GC exposure on the RAS in the adipose tissue of the offspring. One report showed that prenatal betamethasone treatment increased ACE1 mRNA, but not AGT in adipose tissue of male offspring sheep [57].

Therefore, further studies focusing on the enzymatic activity of renin can provide insights into the modulatory functions of renin. Because many RAS molecules are released after their production, we have checked the plasma levels of ANG peptides to represent the abundance of RAS down-stream signaling. Determine the protein amount of indicated RAS molecules precisely in further study may help us to clarify the RAS is activated or inhibited.

Since postnatal HF diet resulted in higher systemic ANG peptides and AGT in adipose tissue, ACE inhibitors and ANG II receptor blockers may be more suitable treatments for HF diet associated hypertension. Prenatal GC exposure increased the gene level of renin but lowered the ACE 1 mRNA and ANG peptide expressions.
