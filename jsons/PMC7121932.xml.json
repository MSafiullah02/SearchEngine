            "text": "Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure are clinically important in older adults because they are common causes of chronic shortness of breath (dyspnea), which reduces quality of life by limiting activity. An older adult with any of these diseases is more likely to experience morbidity (exacerbations and hospitalization) and mortality. Asthma and COPD both cause airway narrowing, which can be detected by spirometry testing. While asthma can start during any decade of life, COPD only develops after decades of cigarette smoking and so is very rare before 40 years of age. It is important to distinguish between asthma, COPD and heart failure because the interventions differ; treatment for asthma is more successful and the prognosis is much better. About 20% of older adults with any one of these causes of dyspnea will also have one of the others (co-morbid conditions).",

Asthma is defined as episodic and reversible airways obstruction. COPD is defined as chronic and irreversible airways obstruction. Other chronic conditions can also cause dyspnea. We define two of these here to distinguish them from asthma and COPD. The definition of chronic bronchitis is based on a history of a chronic cough (productive of sputum or not) which has been present for at least 2 years. Epidemiologic studies use a standardized set of questions to define chronic bronchitis; no objective tests are needed. Emphysema is a term used to describe the irreversible destruction of lung tissue, which is detected using a breathing test called carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) or by high-resolution CT scans of the lungs that show reduced lung density or holes in the lungs (blebs or bullae). Overlap amongst the above chronic lung disease phenotypes does occur since decades of cigarette smoking can cause any one or all of them (asthma, chronic airway obstruction, chronic bronchitis and emphysema).",

The study participant is coached to take as deep a breath as possible and then blow into the \u00adspirometer mouthpiece as quickly as possible for at least 6 s. The volume of air forcefully exhaled during the first second is called the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and the total amount of air exhaled is called the forced vital capacity (FVC) (measured in liters). Healthy middle-aged adults can exhale about 75% of their air in the first second, so the ratio of their FEV1/FVC is about 0.75. Smokers who have developed COPD have a permanently reduced capacity to exhale rapidly, so their FEV1 and their FEV1/FVC fall below the lower limit of the normal range (LLN).",

However, the LLN for this ratio has been controversial. The pulmonary function standards committee of the American Thoracic Society [2]\u2014the largest and most influential pulmonary professional society\u2014recommends using the fifth percentile LLNs from spirometry reference equations from the healthy, never-smoking subset of participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III for use throughout North America [3]. The mean and LLN for the FEV1/FVC from this study (and from most studies of lung function in healthy population-based samples) decrease with aging. So the LLN for this ratio is about 0.75 for young adults and falls to about 0.60 for adults \u226585 years of age (Fig. 24.1). In the year 2000, an industry-sponsored, international group of key opinion leaders published and began extensive worldwide promotion of a COPD clinical practice guideline which defined COPD as a FEV1/FVC ratio <0.70 (a fixed threshold) after inhaling a \u00adfast-acting bronchodilator (post-BD). Many COPD guidelines developed for individual countries quickly adopted this definition. However, compared to the use of an age-adjusted LLN, the use of this fixed threshold to define COPD greatly increases the apparent prevalence of COPD in population-based samples of healthy older adults [4]. The vast majority of patients given a diagnosis of COPD in clinical settings present with symptoms; however, in population-based studies which included spirometry, half of adults with severe \u00adairway obstruction did not report respiratory symptoms. Therefore, epidemiologic studies with spirometry should base the COPD prevalence only on spirometry results.\n",

Some investigators use smoking status to classify the respiratory disease of those with post-BD airway obstruction (never smokers as having asthma or ever smokers as having COPD). Large epidemiological surveys of adults have demonstrated that about one-third of participants who have mild airway obstruction before inhaling a fast-acting bronchodilator (pre-BD) do not have airway obstruction post-BD. However, the majority of studies of chronic lung disease in adults do not take the time to perform post-BD spirometry (since it takes 15\u201320 min).",

Older patients who have asthma often note the onset of asthma after age 60, usually associated with a serious cold or influenza [16]. In contrast, age is a risk factor for COPD since it develops very slowly, with the onset of dyspnea upon exertion prompting a diagnosis in the fifth or sixth decade of life. After age 85, the prevalence of COPD falls, probably due to mortality from other smoking-related diseases.",

Lung function grows with height in childhood and adolescence, reaches a peak in the 20s or early 30s then declines linearly throughout adulthood. FVC starts at 4\u20135 l in young adults (depending on height and gender) then declines by about one-third of a liter per decade. On average, the functional reserve of the lungs continues to slowly erode throughout older age, even in healthy individuals who have never smoked and had no measurable environmental exposures. The FEV1 declines at a somewhat faster rate than the FVC (largely due to a loss of lung tissue elasticity), so the FEV1/FVC also declines with aging. Age-related impairments in respiratory physiology become most problematic during maximal exercise or in an episode of acute lung injury (e.g., pneumonia), as well as in individuals who already have a reduced ventilatory reserve due to lung disease.",

The small x-marks indicate the predicted normal values. Ten minutes after inhaling a bronchodilator (albuterol), his FEV1 increased to 2.0 l (about 33% larger) and his FVC increased to about 3.7 l. If he had been a smoker with COPD, his bronchodilator response would have been much smaller (usually less than 0.25 l)",
