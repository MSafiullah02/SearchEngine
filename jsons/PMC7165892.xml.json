The majority of calves were purchased at 7 days of age, but a group of ten, from 7 days to 7 weeks were purchased from one farm into the current batch. Mixing of age groups is not ideal and will increase the risks of spreading disease from older to younger animals in the group. It was advised to purchase from as few farms as possible, and to ensure all animals were of a similar age. An all\u2010in and all\u2010out policy with a more consistent group would allow better management.",

This is a serious difficulty in any calf\u2010rearing enterprise where newborn calf management is out of the purchaser's control. Young, stressed calves mixing with others from different sources increases the risk of disease, but with an inadequate immune status they are at an even greater risk. As calves usually arrived at 7 days of age, there is the opportunity in future of blood sampling on arrival to assess passive transfer from colostrum. Calves with a total protein >5.2 g/dl have adequate passive transfer (Weaver et al, 2000). Those calves with adequate passive transfer demonstrate better management on the farm of origin and so improved performance for the purchaser. This will also allow improved selection of source farms. Purchasing calves from farms that demonstrate effective control of neonatal disease such as Rotavirus, Coronavirus, E. coli K99 and Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) will further minimise risk. Many calf purchasers will be prepared to pay a premium for animals of known health and vaccination status, and this should encourage calf producers to produce these animals.",
