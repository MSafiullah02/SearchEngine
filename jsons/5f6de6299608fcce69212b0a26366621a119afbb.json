A noninvasive diagnostic test for SARS coronavirus has been reported recently that uses quantitative reverse transcription-PCR with detection of SYBR green fluorescence (5 ) . The PCR primer design was based on a unique region within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-encoding sequence of the virus. The amplification was very specific and showed no cross-reaction with two serogroups of human coronavirus, 229E and OC43.

However, this technique is limited in its clinical use. The samples for PCR were collected from nasopharyngeal aspirates of SARS patients. Because SARS is a respiratory infection, any attempt to obtain a sample from a patient's pharynx and larynx increases the risk of infection to the healthcare worker.

For a potential epitopic peptide, we specifically looked for high local hydrophilicity, charged residues on the exposed protein surface, and accessible surface area. Statistical analysis based on the linear amino acid sequences of the three proteins suggests that, in contrast to the other two viral structural proteins, the N protein contains a high percentage of accessible residues and low hydrophobicity (See Figs. 1-3 in the Data Supplement that accompanies the online version of this article at http://www.clinchem. org/content/vol49/issue12/). A total of 41 peptides spanning multiple possible epitopic sites along the S, M, and N proteins were designed and synthesized in a solid-phase peptide synthesizer. These peptides were purified by HPLC, incubated with panels of sera from both controls and SARS patients, and then subjected to ELISA for measurement of the immunoreactivities. The correlations between the length of amino acid sequence and immunoreactivity are shown in Fig. 1 . The peptides representing the COOH terminus of the N protein, in particular N371 and N385, had high absorbance/cutoff value ratios with the highest positive detection rate and the lowest hydrophobicity score among all of the synthesized peptides (Fig. 1C, and Fig. 3 in the online Data Supplement). Peptide N66 is located in a hydrophilic region and reacts with SARS serum antibodies. However, compared with the peptide region N371-N404, which has a score of 9.4 for accessible residues and a hydrophobicity score of \u03ea3.5, peptide N66 has relatively low antigenicity because of a correspondingly lower score for accessible residues (6.2) and higher score for hydrophobicity (\u03ea1.8). These differences may partially explain the low number of true positives (58%) that we obtained when we used N66 as an antigen. According to the hydrophobicity analysis (Figs. 1 and 2 in the online Data Supplement), most regions in both the S and M proteins are very hydrophobic. Although many factors influence antigen-antibody interactions, two major factors, charge-charge interactions and hydrogen bonding caused by hydrophilicity, have been hypothesized to be crucial for an epitopic site (9 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2393, "end": 2397, "text": "(9 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 636, "end": 645, "text": "Figs. 1-3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1214, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1483, "text": "(Fig. 1C, and Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "statistical analysis"}, {"text": "Of the 41 synthesized peptides, only 5 displayed significantly high immunoreactivity (Table 1) .

Different viruses often cause different immunoresponses. For example, in infectious bronchitis virus (10 ), the S glycoprotein is more antigenic than either the N or the M protein. Because S protein is exposed to the outer viral surface, it is often used as the antigenic group for serologic testing. The M protein, embedded in the viral envelope, has highly variable sequences and is considered to exhibit weak antigenicity, but glycosylation of this protein may elicit antibody production. One common phenomenon is that the N proteins have been shown to be strong immunogens in several coronaviruses, such as murine coronavirus (11 ), turkey coronavirus (12 ) , and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (13 ) . In these viruses, the N protein is a highly abundant and relatively conserved antigen. Importantly, the N protein may be involved in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It has been reported that the N protein accumulates even before it is packaged in the mature virus (14 ) . A cellular immune response elicited early in infection by internal viral proteins could therefore be an important defense mechanism. On the basis of the genomic sequences published to date, most of the SARS-coronavirus N protein is highly conserved among strains.
