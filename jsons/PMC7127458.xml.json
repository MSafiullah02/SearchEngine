Stress conditions induce extensive reprogramming in mRNA metabolism including induction of transcription and translation of specific genes to repair stress-induced damage and adapt to changed conditions. As a consequence, many other genes are silenced via the recruitment of mRNA into SG that stalled with translation pre-initiation complexes [1]. Once the stress condition is released, the SGs are disassembled, and mRNAs are repacked into translationally competent mRNPs and proteins are synthesized.",

SGs are composed of mRNAs in conjunction with a subset of translation initiation factors, including eIF2, eIF2B, eIF4E, the 40S ribosomal subunit, as well as RNA binding proteins. Notable RNA-binding proteins in SGs include TIA-1 [2], and G3BP [3], all of which have self-interaction domains that can contribute to SGs formation. In addition to these core components, SGs contain an eclectic number of proteins, for example deacetylase [4], RNA helicases [5], hnRNP [6], and vary depending on the cell type [7] or duration of the stress signal [8].",

It was also copurified with U5 snRNP complex and promote spliceosome assembly in vitro [14]. These studies suggest that Tudor-SN protein participates in several biological responses and may play distinct roles in various cellular events. Interestingly, Tudor-SN is an integral part of RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) [15], and could recognize hyper-edited double-stranded RNAs (I-dsRNAs) [16], while I-dsRNA molecules specifically binds a complex which comprises many SG components, including G3BP, TIA-1 [17]. Very recently, Tudor-SN was identified as an essential protein for RNA stability and stress tolerance in plants [18]. In our previous study, we identified G3BP as an interaction protein of Tudor-SN in the GST-pull down assay and MOLDI-TOF analysis, which encouraged us to investigate whether Tudor-SN is directly involved in SGs.",

Without stimulation, GFP-G3BP (green, a) and RFP-Tudor-SN (red, b) were distributed and co-localized (merged yellow, c) mainly in the cytoplasm. As reported earlier [3], we also observed that overexpression of G3BP efficiently trigger the assembly of SGs even in the absence of stress stimuli (Fig. 4a, white arrows in the inset), and ectopically expressed Tudor-SN could also recruit into the same foci (Fig. 4b, white arrows in the inset). With arsenite treatment for 5 min, G3BP (green, d) and Tudor-SN (red, e) were gradually re-distributed into some small stress granules which merged into yellow foci (f). At 10 min, lots of stress granules were formed which contained both Tudor-SN (red, h) and G3BP (green, g). After 20 min, the small SGs fused into larger ones which showed double positive staining of G3BP (green, g, j) and Tudor-SN (red, h, k) as indicated in the enlarged areas. In summary, in response to stress stimuli, the stress granules containing both Tudor-SN and G3BP are aggregated first in small size dispersed in the cytoplasm, and then in large granules around the nucleus. These observations demonstrate that Tudor-SN and G3BP are recruited simultaneously to the SGs in response to stress conditions.",

Fig. 5C, (f and i) demonstrated the separate localization of RFP-TSN and GFP-G3BP. This data is consistent with the previous results showing the interaction between G3BP and SN domain, and the lack of interaction with TSN domain. These results demonstrate that the SN domain of Tudor-SN protein is involved in the formation of SGs. To exclude the possibility that the co-localization was caused by GFP and RFP, HeLa cells transfected with empty vector of pEGFP-C1 and p Cherry-C1 were also treated with heat shock or arsenite. As shown in Fig. 5D, the localization of RFP or GFP alone was not affected by the stress treatment (c, f, i), and the insets showed that no cross-detection occurred between the green and red channels.",

Our present study provides direct evidence that Tudor-SN is a bona fide novel component of SGs, which efficiently co-localizes with G3BP in the SGs in response to various stress conditions. To monitor the coordination of Tudor-SN and G3BP, the process of SG assembly was examined in living cells. It is revealed that SG formation begins with appearance of many small foci, which subsequently fuse into larger structures, and the two proteins assemble to SGs with similar kinetics, suggesting that they are recruited in a coordinate manner as a complex. Interestingly, knockdown of endogenous Tudor-SN did not inhibit the formation of SGs, but retarded the aggregation of small SGs into large SGs, while a phosphomimetic mutant (S149E) of G3BP protein significantly inhibited the formation of SGs [3]. It supports the idea that although Tudor-SN participates in the formation of SGs, it may not be an initiator as essential as G3BP to trigger the formation of SGs, but affects the aggregation efficiency of SGs.",

            "text": "In the present study, we clarified that the SN domain, but not the Tudor containing TSN domain of Tudor-SN, is responsible for the recruitment to SGs. This is based on the observations that SN domain directly interacts with the 35S-labled in vitro translated G3BP in the in vitro binding assay, and recruited to the SGs with G3BP. It is the first report that the SN domain is related to the SG formation. Recent evidence indicates that the SN domain of Tudor-SN mediates the interaction with AT1R 3\u2032-UTR, and leads to both stabilization and enhanced translation of AT1R 3\u2032-UTR [21]. Thus Tudor-SN may have potential functions in the regulation of mRNA stability under stress condition via the RNA binding ability of SN domain.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidences indicate that the formation of SGs may relate to diseases. For example, the SGs formed within the tumors in the hypoxic area which are thought to contribute to the radio-resistance of the tumor vasculature [22]. Notably, Tudor-SN is up-regulated in colon cancer [23], breast cancer [24] and prostate cancer [25]. In addition, some viral infections transiently trigger stress granule formation [26], and may be part of the host defense response to limit virus infection. It was reported recently that Tudor-SN interacts with 3\u2032 end of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome [27] and the equine arteritis virus nsp1 [28]. Interestingly, long dsRNAs in cells often indicate the viral infection [29]. Moreover, dsRNAs can be modified to I-dsRNAs which is proposed to induce SG formation, consequently facilitate cell survival during stress and trigger the antiviral activity in the host cells [17]. Alternatively, I-dsRNAs could be recognized and cleaved by Tudor-SN to switch off the I-dsRNA-induced silencing pathway [17]. Thus, Tudor-SN may play important role in defense against viral infection via the formation of SGs. It is likely to generate new insights into future studies on the roles of Tudor-SN in viral infections.",

The consequence is dictated by the intensity of stress, as well as cell intrinsic pathways. However, the underline mechanisms remain unclear. Intriguingly, Caspase 3 could cleave Tudor-SN between Tudor and SN5 domains during stress-induced apoptosis, and this cleavage inhibits its ribonuclease activity [30]. Considering that SN domain of Tudor-SN is responsible for the RNA interaction and SGs formation, we hypothesis that Tudor-SN is likely to take part in both stress and apoptosis regulation and there is potential crosstalk between these two phenomena. Thus further work should be carried out to explore the Tudor-SN function at the molecular and cellular levels which will shed light on the regulation of apoptosis and SGs pathways.",
