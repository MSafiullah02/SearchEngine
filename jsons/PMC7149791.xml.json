With body weights ranging from 150 g to 850 g, the callitrichid species are the smallest of the simian primates. Eponymous is the occurrence of claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe. Marmosets and tamarins are arboreal day-active animals with typical characteristics of New World Primates (NWP). Their broad, flat nose with big nostrils is separated by a wide septum. There is no or only little sexual dimorphism between male and female. They live in groups comprising between two and 30 individuals.",

Nest-boxes made out of wood are advisable as they absorb the moisture better. The nest-box should be placed higher in the cage than natural sleeping sites. It also has to be large enough to allow all animals of the group to sleep in it. If animals need to be caught regularly, it is worth using nest-boxes that can be closed by a sliding door in order to catch them inside. If possible, cages should have a maximum of furnishing that accommodates callitrichid locomotion and behaviour. Branches have to be placed in both horizontal and vertical lanes and can be either fixed or swinging. Runways on branches can be connected with ropes or hose pipes. Shelves are usually used for resting, grooming and playing.",

Garber (1992) reported that marmosets spend 30\u201370% of their feeding time on exudates like gum arabic, with their specially adapted lower anterior dentition and V-shaped mandible. Because of their \u201clong-tusked\u201d dentition, tamarins are called opportunistic exudate eaters which benefit from the bark gouging of marmosets (Ferrari and Martins, 1992). The National Research Council (NRC) recommendations (2003) state that diet of tamarins should consist of 45% insects, 35% fruits, 10% exudates, 7% nectar and 3% seeds, whereas marmosets eat 45% exudates, 16% fruits, 39% insects. Gum arabic provides the marmosets with a source of complex polysaccharides and carbohydrates, certain minerals, especially calcium (Carroll, 1997), and tannin. Trials, in different callitrichid species, with two different diets with or without gum arabic, showed that the addition of gum slowed the gut passage rate in marmosets, without depressing the digestive efficiency (Power and Oftedal, 1996). Marmosets are able to ferment tree exudates with the help of micro-organisms in their bigger cecum (Ferarri and Martins, 1992).",

The NRC recommendation for Vitamin A is 10,000 to 15,000 IU/kg diet. Like all other primates, callitrichids are dependent on an external supply of Vitamin C of 15 mg/kg metabolic bodyweight. With the lack of UV B light, callitrichids can only utilise Vitamin D3 and so the daily requirement for marmosets is 110 IU/100 g LBW and 33 IU/400 g LBW for tamarins (Knapka et al., 1995). In 1997 Power et al.\ncollected blood samples from 18 free ranging cotton-top tamarins. The blood values ranged from 25.5 to 120 ng/ml. Juveniles had higher serum concentrations than adults and pregnant females lower than nonpregnant. The high circulating levels of vitamin D metabolites in captive New World primates are hypothesised to be necessary for their health status because of the low binding affinity of their vitamin D receptor. Serum concentrations below 50 ng/ml may indicate suboptimal vitamin D status. Vitamin B12 is important for the function of the gastrointestinal cells, bone marrow and nerve cells. To date, there are no reliable data about the daily requirements of callitrichids. Recommendations for other vitamins are: Retinol: 171 g/kg LBW, Vitamin E + Se: 0.1\u20130.16 mg/kg LBW and Vitamin K: 2 \u03bcg/kg LBW.\n",

Shortly after birth, and despite lactation, callitrichids ovulate (8 to 18 days post-partum) and can conceive again. In cotton-top tamarins, Ziegler et al. (1987) determined different post-partum ovulation periods depending on litter size: 27.3 \u00b1 1 days after the birth of twins and only 16 \u00b1 0.75 days after giving birth to a singleton.

Implantation of the early embryos is superficial. The placenta consists of two discoid parts connected by vascular anastomosese (Placenta bidiscoidalis) and is permeable to antibodies (Placenta haemochorialis). Thus twins are immunological blood chimers. At conception the litter may comprise a higher number than will be born, since marmosets are capable of resorbing individual embryos without disturbance of the development of the others (Jaquish et al., 1995). Resorption can only occur until the end of the embryonic period. Death of the foetus in later gestation stages might either cause abortion of the whole litter or mummification of the dead foetus.",

It produces severe ulceration in the facial area, oral cavity and oesophagus and can lead to death within 48 hours with an incubation period of seven days. Many facilities therefore recommend that people with cold sores should not work with the animals. The reservoir host for Herpes tamarinus is the Squirrel monkey. It is transmitted via saliva, bite wounds, capture nets and gloves. After an incubation period of 7\u201310 days, the animals develop multiple ulcerations of lips, eyes and oesophagus and nasal discharge, apathy and anorexia, death occurring from between 2 and 3 days. Callitrichids and cebids should therefore not be housed together (King, 1967). Herpes saguinus was described by Melendez (1971) as not leading to clinical symptoms. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), which occurs very often as a latent infection in Old World Primates (OWP), seems not to be relevant in marmosets, and has been isolated from the salivary gland of tamarins without clinical symptoms (Nigida et al., 1979). Herpes saimiri is latent in Squirrel monkeys without symptoms but leads to malignant lymphomas in callitrichids and Old World Primates. Herpes ateles is also known to produce lymphomas. Inoculation with Varicella zoster evokes delayed antibody titres but no clinical symptoms. Epstein-Barr-Virus is an established animal model in callitrichids but it does not occur naturally. Ramer et al. (2000) described a syndrome of weight loss, loss of appetite, diarrhoea and palpable abdominal mass with grossly large mesenteric lymph nodes. Cho et al.

Antibiotic treatment with Doxycycline works well. Vaccination is indicated if there is a manifest infection in the colony (Brack et al., 1997). Campylobacter spp. is one of the most frequently isolated organisms from NHP with diarrhoea, or even from asymptomatic animals. Campylobacter jejuni is a cause of diarrhoea and enterocolitis in tamarins (Paul-Murphy, 1993) producing yellowish, soft mucoid faeces that can also contain occult blood. Faecal-oral route is the primary mode of transmission. It is of higher prevalence in wild caught animals and is a sign of poor hygiene in captivity (Gozalo et al., 1991). Erythromycin is the antibiotic of choice (Johnson et al., 2001). Brack et al. (1998) reported cases of Erysipelothrix insidiosa septicaemia in red bellied tamarins and common marmosets. Pathological lesions were gastrointestinal haemorrhages, hepatitis and myocarditis. A vaccination with porcine Erysipelothrix insisdiosa vaccine terminated the infection. Pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli are an important cause of diarrhoea although not well documented as a cause of diarrhoea in NHP. The enteropathogenic (EPEC) strain induces watery, non inflammatory, non bloody diarrhoea while the EHEC (enterohaemorrhagic) strain induces life-threatening haemorrhagic diarrhoea due to the production of a shiga-like toxin, associated with anaemia and neutrophilic leucocytosis (Thomson and Scheffler, 1996). Animals become anorexic, inactive, lethargic and develop a recognised clinical dehydration (Mansfield et al., 2001). Treatments are Enrofloxacine and supportive fluids.",

There is also evidence of immune dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infection in affected individuals (DeSousa, 1989). Spelman et al.

Clinical symptoms are rapid weight loss (>30% of LBW/week), dull fur, alopecia, particularly on the tail and breast, muscle atrophy, diarrhoea or obstipation colitis. Clinical pathology includes normochromic anaemia, thrombocytosis, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbu-minaemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels (Logan and Khan, 1996; Tucker, 1984). Lewis et al. (1987) compared the faecal microflora of healthy marmosets with animals who developed WMS. The latter showed an increase of bacteriodes and fewer lactobacilli. The value of dietary lactobacilli in NHP is a largely unexplored area. A chronic inflammation may be the primary insult in the development of WMS in many marmosets. Treatment with antibiotics and supportive care with fluids, immune modulators, Vitamin D3 and Calcium, Ensure\u00ae, Nutri-Cal\u00ae may help.",
