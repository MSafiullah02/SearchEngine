Cough was a symptom in eight of ten patients reported by Tsang and colleagues2 and was a clinical feature in only 57% of the 156 patients reported by Lee and co-workers.3 Readers cannot and should not assume in a study with few patients that the sample is representative of the population. Patients who do not cough obviously do not generate aerosol. A small non-representative sample of patients with SARS who happen not to have a cough would give a false impression that wearing surgical masks alone offers adequate protection against aerosol when no aerosol exists. Whereas coughing produces large droplets that settle rapidly in the absence of air currents, it also generates particles less than 1 \u03bcm in diameter,4 suggesting that surgical masks are not an absolute means of protection against respiratory pathogens.",
