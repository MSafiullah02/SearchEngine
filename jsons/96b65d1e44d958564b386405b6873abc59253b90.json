Furthermore, hydrothermal technique was used to incorporate various concentrations (2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt%) of zirconium (Zr) as a dopant. The prepared undoped and doped BN samples were evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. Structural analysis was undertaken using x-ray diffraction which identified the presence of hexagonal BN. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were utilized to outline IR fingerprint and electronic properties of the synthesized material. Morphological information was obtained through micrographs extracted using field emission scanning electron spectroscope (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), while d-spacing was also calculated through HRTEM analysis. Optical properties and emission spectra were examined by applying UV-vis and photoluminescence spectroscope (PL); whereas, band gap analysis was carried out via Tauc plot. Zr-doped BN nanosheets at increasing concentrations (0.5, 1.0 mg/50 \u03bcl) revealed enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli compared to S. aureus (p < 0.05).",

            "text": "In the recent years, studies focused on protection from infection through pathogenic micro-organisms have received considerable attention. Such research plays an important role in ensuring the provision of a healthy, reliable, and comfortable living environment. Among these pathogens, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza virus (H 1 N 1 ) produce terrible effects on human life (Fu et al. 2011) . Mukaddas et al. reported that ~ 50 to 70% of deaths result from infection caused by micro-organisms. Similarly, bovine udder glandular tissue inflammation (mastitis) is a major economic threat to dairy industry around the globe. Its potential to transmit zoonotic infections i.e., streptococcal sore throat, leptospirosis, tuberculosis, and brucellosis to humans is a major concern. Bovine mastitis is characterized M. Ikram and I. Jahan are equally contributed. by chemical and microbiological changes in milk as well as pathological changes in glandular tissues of bovine udder. Infectious etiological agents, especially bacteria, viruses, and fungi, are divided into two categories. Major category consists of Staphylococcus aureas (S. aureus), Streptococci, Coliform, and Corynebacterium pyogenes, whereas minor group includes pathogens such as Corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative Staphylococci. These pathogens cause harmful diseases that can severely affect human and animal health (Gnanamani et al. 2003; Haider et al. 2019 ). On the other hand, antimicrobial resistance depicted by Gram-positive bacterial pathogens such as S. aureus (MRSA) has been increasing at an alarming rate. In view of the above, studies related to antimicrobial, antivirus, and antifungal behavior have received growing attention since 2003 (Naidu et al. 2005; Grassberger et al. 1984) .",

During recent years, various bio-applications of nanomaterials and their biocompatibility have been investigated (Majewski and Thierry 2007; Yang et al. 2014) . Graphene is the most interesting two-dimensional layered material (2D-mats) that exhibits distinctive properties resulting in several applications, especially in biomedical science. Encouraged by the results extracted from graphene, researchers turned their attention to graphene-analogous 2D-mats such as molebdinum-disulphide (MoS 2 ), boron nitride (BN), and tungsten disulphide (WS 2 ). Owing to its specific crystalline and chemical structure, these 2D-mats exhibit distinct properties compared to not only host graphene but also relative to each other Zhang et al. 2016; Mahmoudi et al. 2018; Ikram et al. 2020a) . Various properties of 2D-mats render them attractive for biomedical applications. 2D graphene and its analogous materials have been recommended for use in bioimaging, photothermal therapy, biosensors, and biomedical implants, particularly in antimicrobial applications (Liu et al. 2012 (Liu et al. ,2009 Yang et al. 2010) .",

            "text": "BN reveals honeycomb-like structure analogous to graphene with periodic arrangement among boron as well as nitrogen atoms. This structure is characterized by substantial sp 2 (in-plane) covalent bonding and faint van der Waals forces between the layers (Kostoglou et al. 2015) . Moreover, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) possesses excellent physical, chemical, thermal, electrical, optical, and dielectric properties such as high hardness, good chemical inertness, fine electrical insulation, high melting point, superior thermal conductivity and stability, high optical transparency, and low dielectric constant (Kostoglou et al. 2015; Meziani et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2017) . Meanwhile, BN is a good insulator material that exhibits a wide band gap of 5.9 eV. Incorporation of transition metal (Co, Mn, Fe, and Zr) in nanosheets as dopant serves to modify its optical, electronic, and thermal properties . Zirconium exhibits good antibacterial behavior, therefore it serves as a reliable antibacterial agent (Huang et al. 2013a ). Incorporation of Zr into BN nanosheets enhances its antibacterial activity. The literature studies indicate an enhancement of antibacterial effect due to incorporation of doping (Silva et al. 2018; Merlo et al. 2018 ). In addition, antibacterial activity depends upon shape, size, bonding as well as surface energy of the material. Interaction of BN nanosheets to exhibit biocompatibility has been reported using molecular dynamic simulation. Few experimental investigations have been reported to highlight the biocompatibility of BN nanosheets with kidney such that the BN nanosheets with optimum length of 10 mm, synthesized by chemical vapor deposition process exhibited zero cytotoxicity (Mateti et al. 2018 ). Cytotoxic and cell viability experiments showed direct proportionality between concentration and exposure time of BN nanosheets with regard to its biocompatibilty performance (Horvath et al. 2011; Ciofani et al. 2010) .",

Obtained PL spectra were observed with excitation and emission wavelength of 220 and 310 nm, respectively, as nanomaterials are quite sensitive to excitation wavelength. PL spectra indicate wide band centered at ~ 325 nm (blue emission) that is assigned to vacancies present, which epitomize as electron-hole recombination, adsorption, activation, and photosensitivity centers (Lee and Song 2017) . Another peak observed at ~ 480 nm reveals that the intensity increases sharply from undoped (control sample) to doped sample; whereas, for 10 wt% Zr-doped BN, it reduces abruptly. The most intense peak implies maximum recombination of photogenerated charges where the lowest intensity indicates separation of electron-holes (Silly et al. 2007 ). Therefore, it is concluded that an excitation-dependent PL behavior is observed that is in agreement with the previously reported results .",

Extracted spectra demonstrate absorption peak at 210 nm stretched out in UV region (see Fig. 4a ) which corresponds to optical band gap of 5.74 eV. The calculated band gap matched well with the reported values. No absorption peak at lower or higher energy side was identified which indicates the existence of dense structural defects (Mahdizadeh et al. 2017) . The literature survey indicates that the band gap for multilayer h-BN was 6.07 eV; whereas, single layer exhibits a band gap of 5.56-5.92 eV. Besides these, theoretical analysis reveals a band gap of 6.0 eV. This difference in band gap is due to electronic band dispersion caused by layer-to-layer interaction (Zhang et al. 2017b; Kumbhakar et al. 2015) . Upon incorporation of Zr, red shift in wavelength was observed that serves to decrease band gap from 5.72 to 4.55 eV as demonstrated in Fig. 4b via Tauc plot. This decrease in band gap coincides with the experimental observation of increase in crystallite size as calculated using XRD analysis.",

From FESEM micrograph in Fig. 5a , it can be seen that the obtained particles exhibited aggregated nanosheets structure. Smooth surface of nanosheets compact with uniform features and round edges was also observed. Meanwhile, doped samples shown in Fig. 6b -e indicate high agglomeration with the presence of Zr above nanosheets. Furthermore, microstructure of samples was investigated through HRTEM study as shown in Fig. 5a\u2032 -d\u2032. Typical HRTEM images of control and doped-BN Effect of doping can be seen from obtained micrographs. Dark spots on HRTEM images depict decoration of Zr on BN nanosheets. The observed morphology of prepared samples affirms that chemical exfoliation did not produce adverse effect on nanosheets (\u00d6zkan et al. 2019) . It is worth mentioning that the viability of cells exposed to bulk BN and nanosheets varied. As BN is a chemically inert material, altering its size from bulk to micro/nanoscale affects BN's biocompatibility. Pure and Zr-doped BN nanosheets as indicated in Fig. 5(a-d) are produced as a result of chemical exfoliation of bulk BN which exhibit good antimicrobial activity because of their change in size from bulk to nanoscale (Mateti et al. 2018) . Experimental results indicate that FESEM and HRTEM analysis agree well with each other.",

Successful incorporation of dopants was tested through XRD, FTIR, Raman, PL, UV-vis, FESEM, and HR-TEM. Hexagonal phase of BN was affirmed via XRD analysis, while FTIR spectra indicated the presence of sp 2 bonded B-N (in-plane) and B-N-B (out of plane) bending vibrations that belonged to IR fingerprints of BN nanosheets. Raman analysis showed E 2g active band of BN whereas PL spectra indicated excitons recombination and transfer rate. Spectra evaluated by means of UV-Vis. spectroscopy indicated an absorption that lies in the deep UV region which makes it suitable for use in optoelectronic devices; however, band gap decreases with the incorporation of dopant due to quantum confinement effect. Sheet-like morphology was confirmed through FESEM and HR-TEM analysis. Calculated interlayer spacing (0.34 nm) matched well with that reported in the literature. In conclusion, significant inhibition zones were observed for Zr-doped BN against S. aureus in the range (0-1 mm) and (1-3.6 mm) at low and high concentrations and similarly, (0-3.6 mm) and (2.55-5 mm) for E. coli.
