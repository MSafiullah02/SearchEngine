In most scenarios, patients undergoing liver transplantation require a stay in the ICU, whereas kidney and pancreas transplant patients\u2019 need for ICU care may vary from institution to institution. It must be pointed out that in this era of organ shortage and higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) patients undergoing liver transplantation, the ICU is becoming even more critical in the pathway of successful transplants. ICU organization may vary widely, from being run by anesthesiology, surgery, or medical intensivists, but the take-home message does not change. Patients are sicker now more than ever at time of transplant, and exhaustive, detail-oriented critical care is necessary for success.",

The factors affecting ICU admission were MELD at time of transplant, BMI, operative time, transfusion requirements, and age [1, 2]. This is an exciting prospect that may be beneficial to patients and a cost-saving measure, but unfortunately this does not apply to many regions across the country who are often transplanting patients that are in the ICU on life support.",

There is no set pressure at which is needed to perfuse the liver; however, abrupt changes in blood pressure can be detrimental to vascular anastomoses and to the transplanted organ itself. It should be noted that abrupt changes in blood pressure or continued hypotension should be avoided, and prompt repeat lab values must be checked with a high index of suspicion for ongoing hemorrhage. If the patient is not bleeding, the use of vasopressors or inotropes based on SVR and cardiac function should be used. In most cases, for liver transplant patients, norepinephrine and/or vasopressin is first line [3, 4].",

Blood transfusion in the immediate postoperative period can be used slightly more liberally in transplant patients, especially when unclear whether there is ongoing bleeding. The use of albumin postoperatively for volume expansion is used fairly frequently in liver recipients as well, although its benefits remain suspect even in the transplant population [6, 7]. Additionally, it is often acceptable to use crystalloid running maintenance fluids such as 5 % dextrose with either 0.45 % or 0.9 % normal saline. One must take into account the electrolytes including sodium and potassium which may be abnormal in cirrhotic transplant recipients when choosing fluids [8].",

Extubation immediately after liver transplantation has been shown to be safe with no increased risk in reintubation [9\u201311]. Early extubation in these patients can decrease ventilator-associated pneumonia but also may decrease venous congestion through the liver. The use of positive pressure ventilation may increase the intrathoracic pressure thus decreasing flow from the intrahepatic vena cava. It should be noted, however, that not all patients are amenable to early extubation as many have been admitted in the ICU pretransplant with prolonged and debilitating encephalopathy; thus, each patient should be treated individually. It is not uncommon to have post-transplant oxygenation difficulty that may or may not have been present prior to transplant. This must be worked up using a standard algorithm that one might use for any ICU patient. Oftentimes this may be related to pretransplant volume overload, pleural effusions, iatrogenic pneumothoraxes, ascites, or change in abdominal domain [9].",

In severe ARDS, patients should be treated as per standard protocol with high-frequency, low-volume ventilation. The use of increased positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be used with caution as it has been shown to decrease hepatic outflow, increase stasis in the portacaval system, and decrease cardiac output in these patients, but data remains controversial.

HPS involves an increased A-a gradient, liver disease, and lastly intrapulmonary vascular dilations. It is usually diagnosed by means of contrast echocardiography with physiology involving functional shunting as well as increased nitric oxide. The treatment begins preoperatively and includes garlic, pentoxifylline, and methylene blue, which may be restarted post-transplant, but the gold standard in therapy is liver transplantation. These patients with the improvement of ICU care have outcomes similar to patients without HPS. In one small series, there has been a reported 64 % 10-year survival after liver transplant for HPS. The quality outcomes following transplant with HPS are accompanied by long intensive care stays and aggressive pulmonary optimization. These patients should be kept volume negative if hemodynamics allow using diuresis and even initiating continuous hemodialysis as necessary along with the addition of supplemental oxygen over long periods of time [14\u201316].",

Some centers obtain routine ultrasound in the first 24 hours while others only image if clinically applicable. It is important for the surgical team to communicate in detail with the ICU team regarding any concerns they may have, as some grafts may have more tenuous vascular connections than others, which might prompt quicker evaluation and action. Intraoperative variables that increase the rate of primary nonfunction (PNF) and delayed graft function should also be relayed to the ICU and include massive transfusion, reperfusion syndrome, and prolonged warm ischemia time. In addition to communicating regarding technical aspects of the operation, the team should impart information regarding the donor quality and hemodynamic changes in the operating room especially in regard to reperfusion syndrome as these may affect liver enzymes and function in the first few days. When it comes to donor quality, one must recognize that age greater than 60, >30 % macrosteatosis, cold ischemia time >12 h, and donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors are all independent variables that are more associated with PNF [17, 18, 19]. It is important to be cognizant of the current definition of early allograft dysfunction which includes bilirubin >10 mg/dL, INR \u22651.6, and alanine or aspartate aminotransferases >2,000 IU/L all on day 7 [20]. The workup for graft dysfunction and lab abnormalities is complex, and a diagnostic and treatment algorithm is helpful in the management in these critically ill patients (Fig. 35.1).\n",

The first evaluation in both liver and kidney transplantation is usually a duplex ultrasound of the transplanted graft looking for an array of possible postoperative complications. One might even perform a quick bedside evaluation in the ICU to rule out peri-graft hematoma if suspicious which could cause compression necrosis or even decrease vascular flow to and from the graft placing it at risk for failure. The use of duplex ultrasound should be the standard of care in the ICU for any concerning lab values or graft dysfunction after transplantation. Formal duplex ultrasound can evaluate the inflow of the hepatic artery and portal vein, and outflow via the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava. Ultrasound may also show biliary ductal dilatation or fluid collection, which may prompt further evaluation of the biliary system to rule out obstruction or ongoing bile leak. Ultrasound is a very versatile, quick, noninvasive, and cost-effective means of imaging in the early period and should be used as a screening tool. The use of duplex ultrasound initially after liver transplantation is most often used to rule out hepatic artery thrombosis, which occurs in up to 9 % of the recipients [22]. Normal resistive indices (RIs) are usually between 0.6 and 0.9, but one should always review the ultrasound wave forms as they can be revealing, showing some compromise with normal RIs seen in the report. The intrahepatic arteries must be evaluated in order to be a complete study and if absent should warrant further imaging or exploration if concerned. RIs greater than 0.9 may be due to resistance within the liver, which may be from injury to the liver parenchyma post-reperfusion or edema. The portal flow should be evaluated to rule out portal vein thrombosis looking at velocity, which should be greater than 25 cm/s [21].",

MR angiography and venography can also be limited in the setting of AKI due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [23]. Due to the limitations of imaging in the setting of AKI, one might opt to explore the patient, as this is a more definitive means of assessing the vasculature. As for biliary complications, concerning findings might prompt either magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography.

Diagnostic criteria include the presence of the following: ascites, creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, no improvement of creatinine after 2 days of fluid or albumin challenge with withdrawal diuretics, absence of shock, withdrawal of nephrotoxic medications, and lack of intrinsic renal disease and a normal ultrasound [25]. Roughly 40 % of patients with cirrhosis and ascites will develop HRS. It is caused by a physiologic state that includes, hyper-dynamic cardiac function, decreased SVR, low arterial blood pressure, and renal vasoconstriction [26]. The gold standard treatment for this complication of liver disease is liver transplant as patients with HRS have only slightly worse long-term outcomes after LT than those without it. They do however have a higher incidence of postoperative morbidity, early mortality, and longer length of stay [27].",

In addition, other factors that affect the later onset of renal failure include infections, reexploration, and contrast-induced nephropathy, as imaging is common in the postoperative setting. Furthermore, drug-induced tubular injury is also a significant contributor to renal failure in these patients as calcinuerin inhibitors (CNIs) as well as aminoglycosides are commonly used for both immunosuppression and antibiosis, respectively [28]. Treatment of immediate renal failure in the post-transplant setting is multifaceted. Depending on the recipient, lowering or delayed use of CNIs may be the first step, along with management of blood glucose and blood pressure according to standard intensive care protocols. One must also rule out thrombotic microangiopathy, which can be difficult to diagnose etiology for ARF in post-transplant patients. One must recognize a hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia to make this diagnosis and initiate plasmapheresis if necessary. BK virus should also be ruled out as a cause of renal dysfunction in patients that undergo kidney transplant as well as simultaneous liver and kidney transplant [29].",

Creatinine has been a marker that has been variable in its reliability since many of these patients have reduced muscle mass, poor protein intake, hyperbilirubinemia, and reduced hepatic synthesis of creatinine.

In some cases, these rare infections may present within the first month post-transplant and should be considered if etiology remains unsourced. The clinician must be mindful that many of these infections are endemic to a specific geographic region, which is helpful in the diagnosis. Risk of these infections can be lowered by the use of prophylactic agents fluconazole and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole being some of the more common agents used [21, 37].",
