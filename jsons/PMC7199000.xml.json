            "text": "The appearance of new viruses with a high epidemic potential is often the result of complex dynamics involving animals, humans and the environment (Coker et al., 2011). Coronavirus can be considered as a paradigm of this phenomenon, in the last 18 years it has caused three new alarming diseases: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (WHO, 2020a). The family of Coronaviridae includes strains that infect humans with a wide range of clinical symptoms, from those associated with the common cold to potentially lethal respiratory syndromes. Other Coronaviridae strains infect birds and mammals (ICTV, 2012). The high variability of this virus makes cross-infections among species possible, potentially leading to spillover (Chan et al., 2015). In fact before the outbreak of the current virus, a number of authors addressing the environmental circulation of viruses had already highlighted the potential new pandemic threat posed by coronavirus (Wigginton and Ellenberg, 2015\n;\nMorse et al., 2012\n;\nSantos and Monteiro, 2013).",

In fact, the fecal elimination of coronavirus is well-known and has been confirmed for SARS-CoV (Yam et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005a; Petrich et al., 2006; He et al., 2007), MERS CoV (Drosten et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2017) and SARS-CoV-2 (Holshue et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The potential fecal-oral transmission was recently highlighted by Yeo et al. (2020). Moreover, possible transmission through bioaerosols from toilet flushing was demonstrated in Hong Kong for the SARS epidemic cluster in Amoy Gardens (Watts, 2003; Yu et al., 2004) and was recently suggested for SARS-CoV-2 (Ong et al., 2020). Finally, the involvement of fecally-contaminated food in coronavirus transmission is generally not considered but cannot be ruled out, given the survival of the human or animal coronavirus on vegetables (Mullis et al., 2013; Y\u00e9piz-G\u00f3mez et al., 2013).",

The problem of water pollution was also addressed in a technical brief of the WHO on water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management for COVID-19 (March 3, 2020).

Abd-Elmaksoud et al. (2014) analysed 20 L of dechlorinated tap water with different turbidities, spiked with BCoV (detected with PCR). They found highly variable virus recovery rates (18.1 \u00b1 20.1%). Results from the samples with low turbidity reported the highest recovery efficiency (25.8 \u00b1 21.3%). Blanco et al. (2019) optimized the glass wool filtration method using 50 L of surface waters spiked with TGEV (detected with cell cultures) by raising the pH of the buffer eluent to 11.0 (at 9.5 for non-enveloped viruses), by increasing the contact time from 10 to 20 min, and using a 20% concentration of PEG instead of 10%. The virus recovery thus improved from 0.40% to 5.1 \u00b1 1.4%. Although both studies used the same method, the results are not directly comparable because the studies differed in terms of coronavirus strain, type and volume of water samples, quantity of virus seeded and detection method.",

In tap water, coronavirus showed a 3 Log10 decrease in 10 days at 23 \u00b0C and over a longer period (estimated >100 days) at 4 \u00b0C. In addition, FIVP inactivation at 4 \u00b0C was faster compared to HCoV-229E. In wastewater (only at 23 \u00b0C) both coronaviruses survived for a shorter period: 2\u20134 days.

The survival was strongly prolonged at 4 \u00b0C: over 49 days, no reduction was observed both in reagent-grade and lake water for MHV, whilst a 1 Log10 reduction after 14 days was observed in lake water for TGEV. This study also demonstrated a faster decline in infectivity in wastewater: in particular a 2 Log10 reduction was observed after nine and seven days for TGEV and MHV, respectively, in pasteurized sewage at 23\u201325 \u00b0C (room temperature) and 2 Log10 and 1 Log10 reductions after 35 days at 4 \u00b0C.

Studying MHV and phage \u03d56 in raw sewage, Ye et al. (2016) compared the virus survival in pasteurized and unpasteurized wastewater. While in pasteurized sewage, they found a 2 Log10 reduction at 25 \u00b0C after 30\u201340 h for MHV and >50 h for phage \u03d56, in the unpasteurized samples, the inactivation time was reduced to 13 and 7 h, respectively, indicating the possible role of other microorganisms (bacteria and protozoa) in the viral inactivation.

They used an automated large-volume sample collection and virus concentration system based on pre-filtration and glass-wool filter. The virus eluates were then analysed using RT-qPCR for BCoV and various other viruses. Around 20-L composite samples were obtained mixing 5-L subsamples collected over time by the system in two different conditions (low-flow period and during runoff events) for a total of 63 samples. The eluates were analysed using RT-qPCR to measure both human (adenovirus, enterovirus, norovirus genogroups I and II, hepatitis A virus, and rotavirus) and bovine (adenovirus, enterovirus, rotavirus group A, polyomavirus, coronavirus, and bovine viral diarrhoea virus types 1 and 2) enteric viruses. During the study period, all the human viruses were detected in the samples, as well as numerous animal and bovine viruses except BCoV.",

However, current knowledge is very scarce and fragmentary. Prior to COVID-19, interest in this topic was very low owing to the common belief that enveloped viruses cannot survive for extended periods in water. However, the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 is not involved in environmental circulation cannot be accepted without better knowledge, as highlighted by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater by six different global research groups.",
