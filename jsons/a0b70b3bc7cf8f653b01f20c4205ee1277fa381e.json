The oral antidiabetic drug metformin is commonly used in the treatment of diabetes type 2 and increasingly in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS ) since it not only improves insulin resistance but also decreases gluconeogenesis and activates hepatic sex hormone binding globulin production. In humans, metformin is marginally metabolized and eliminated by the kidney. It is widely known that there is a great variability in the clinical response to metformin.

Pyruvate dehydrogense kinase isoforms inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase, which constitutes an important step in glucose metabolism. It is involved in various phenomena of aging and its expression changes with age, which is generally not well understood as yet. Cardiac metabolism of glucose is very tightly controlled in order to maintain the variable energy demand that is required by cardiac tissue. Energy metabolism of the cardiac myocyte can be regulated within seconds up to a few minutes or chronically regulated within the time frame of hours to days. Glucose metabolism is activated in early myocardial ischemia and in response to an increased need of high-energy-phosphate in the healthy heart during extreme physical activity. In myocardial ischemia, inhibition of PDK expression would be beneficial in order to shift myocardial metabolism from adult towards the fetal phenotype, thus metabolising more glucose than fat in order to preserve myocardial integrity.",

Consequently, CYP2C9 polymorphisms may also affect the extent of clopidogrel-mediated platelet inhibition.

Research of the last two decades tells us that \u03b2-blockers not only are excellent antihypertensive drugs but also successfully counteract deleterious spirals in CHF and ischemia. Recent data have suggested in this context that the return of AGATM expression from its elevated level to normal during recovery from ischemia may be a consequence of \u03b2 -blocker therapy. Here, we look at the expression of AGATM in experimentally normoxic and hypoxic human myocardial tissue derived from cardiac surgery the presence and absence of \u03b2-blockers in vivo. In microarray preliminary (Table 1) Using real-time PCR, we could confirm the above data: We found that, without the influence of betablockers, there is no significant regulation of AGATM-expression during myocardial ischemia. There was, however, a significant difference between the expression of AGATM during myocardial ischemia in the presence of atenolol (1.546 \u00b1 0.05) and nebivolol (1.10 \u00b1 0.04; \u00b1 SEM; P \u2264 0.05). As to myocardial ischemia, O 2 -consumption correlates with the amount of cytoplasmic creatine available. The synthesis of high energy phosphate and thus oxygen consumption will be decreased in myocardial tissue prone to a lesser creatine synthesis. Thus, down-regulation of myocardial AGATM by \u00df-blockers may partially explain cardioprotective effects of \u03b2-blockers and help to reduce cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients at risk for ischemic heart disease an CHF. Background: Myotonic dystrophy 1 (MD1) is an autosomal dominant disorder that is regarded as the most common muscular dystrophy in adults. Patients with MD1 are at high risk for arrhythmias and sudden death due to conduction defects as well as ventricular arrhythmias. Implantable cardioverters (ICD) and antibradycardic pacemakers (PM) are effective to prevent fatal outcomes of arrhythmias, and the proper selection of patients is crucial. Implantable loop-recorders (ILR) are developed to detect arrhythmias. Aim of the study was to present our experience with ILR in patients with MD1.",

Using PCR for validation, we find that during experimental ischemia, there is an up-regulation of MPO-expression. There is a differential regulation between different beta-blockers during myocardial ischemia, which warrant further investigation. We believe that there are complex pleiotropic effects of \u03b2-blockers on immunity. Such pleiotropic effects have received more attention recently. For example, in the JUPITER trial, in apparently healthy persons without hyperlipidemia but with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, rosuvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events by unfolding pleiotropic anti-inflammatory actions. (JUPITER Study N Engl J Med. 2008 Nov). Our preliminary results show that \u03b2-blockers inhibit the expression of T-cell immunity related genes during experimental hypoxia and we find that during experimental ischemia, there is an up-regulation of MPO-expression. There is a differential regulation between different beta-blockers during myocardial ischemia, which warrant further investigation. In the light of JUPITER and other recent publications on modulating inflammation by pleiotropic effects of cardiovascular drugs, the specific property of immune modulation by \u03b2-blockers in myocardial ischemia may warrant further attention. However, a further detailed exploration on both expression and molecular level is certainly needed.

The clinical picture caused by the R554L fibrinogen A\u03b1 chain variant is similar to that associated with the more prevalent E526V mutation. In the ongoing controversy whether specific forms of amyloidosis may be restricted to the kidneys, our data support the position that these rare fibrinogen mutations lead to a unique disease entity that is not accompanied by generalized vascular amyloid disposition. Background: Hypertonic citrate (46.7 %) instilled into catheters inevitably spills into the systemic circulation in exchange for blood entering the catheter and diluting the concentration of the lock solution. This process is driven by different densities of whole blood and lock solution. Hence, in a vertical catheter, intra-luminal citrate concentration ranges from 0 (at the tip in catheters with sideholes), 3 % (between the sideholes and the relativ highest point of the catheter) to 46.7 % (at the luer end) with potential differences in antimicrobial effects. We in vitro investigated the antimicrobial efficacy of pure citrate 46.7 %, citrate 46.7 % diluted with whole blood (= citrate 3 %) and of whole blood without citrate, mimicking in vivo conditions in different catheter compartiments.",

Auch respiratorisch zeigte sich der Patient kompromittiert, war jedoch zun\u00e4chst unter Insufflation von 4 L/min O 2 kompensiert. Die Angeh\u00f6rigen des Patienten berichteten, dass die ersten Symptome (Exanthem, Fieber, Husten und R\u00fcckenschmerzen) vor drei Tagen zu beobachten waren. Am Tag der Aufnahme kam es zu einer pl\u00f6tzlichen Bewusstseinseintr\u00fcbung. Wegen hochgradigen Verdachts auf eine Meningoencephalitis erfolgte eine Lumbalpunktion.

Aufgrund der erheblichen Unruhe des Patienten erfolgte \u00fcber einige Stunden eine Sedierung mit Midazolam. Eine in weiterer Folge durchgef\u00fchrte Magnetresonanztomographie des Gehirns zeigte unauff\u00e4llige Verh\u00e4ltnisse. Am 3.

Die Buschviper wurde etwa 4 Wochen zuvor in Afrika gefangen und zum Verkauf weiter nach Europa transportiert. Unmittelbar nach dem Biss kam es zu Allgemeinsymptomatik mit Schwindel und kurzer Bewusstlosigkeit. Etwa 5 Stunden nach dem Biss wurde er auf unserer Intensivstation aufgenommen. Bei Aufnahme war der Patient voll ansprechbar, neurologisch unauff\u00e4llig sowie kardiorespiratorisch stabil (RR 120/60 mmHg, SaO 2 95 %, Puls 100/min) und afebril. Im Bereich des linken Zeigefingers zeigte sich eine etwa 3 cm lange gro\u00dfe Nekrose. In den blutchemischen Befunden auff\u00e4llig ein nicht nachweisbares Fibrinogen, mit nicht messbarer PTZ und PTT, normales AT III, geringgradig verminderte Thrombozytenzahl, normale Erythrozytenzahl und eine erh\u00f6hte Leukozytenzahl bei normalem CRP. In der ROTEM Analyse zeigte sich eine verl\u00e4ngerte Gerinnungszeit (CT), Gerinnungsbildungszeit (CFT) sowie eine stark verminderte Gerinnselfestigkeit (MCF) im EXTEM und INTEM als Zeichen einer verminderten H\u00e4mostase Kapazit\u00e4t, im FIBTEM stellte sich eine Nulllinie als Ausdruck des nicht nachweisbaren Fibrinogen bzw. der St\u00f6rung der Fibrinpolymerisierung dar. Es erfolgte initial eine Schocktherapie mit Ringerlaktat bei Hypotension, eine schmerzstillende Therapie mit Paracetamol, Diclofenac und Sufentanil, eine Stressulcusprophylaxe mit Esomeprazol, eine konservative lokale Therapie mit Ruhigstellung, Armhochlagerung, t\u00e4glichen Verbandswechseln nach antiseptischer Wundbehandlung, sowie die Gabe von Fibrinogen zur Behandlung der Koagulopathie. In den ersten 24 Stunden wurden insgesamt 10 g Fibrinogen verabreicht um das Fibrinogen auf 72 mg/dl anzuheben. Es kam damit auch zu einer Normalisierung der PTT und PTZ. In den n\u00e4chsten 24 Stunden war nochmals 2 g Fibrinogen notwendig. Bei Fieber und steigenden Entz\u00fcndungsparametern wurde am 2.Tag eine Antibiose mit Sulbactam/Ampicillin begonnen und am 5. Tag um Clindamycin erweitert. Eine Tetanusauffrischung war bei bestehendem Impfschutz nicht notwendig.

Defekte in der Suppressionskapazit\u00e4t von regulatorischen T-Zellen in Patienten mit Diabetes mellitus Typ 1 sind altersabh\u00e4ngig B. Prietl 1 , G. Bock 1 , M. Tauschmann 1 , E. Fr\u00f6hlich-Reiterer 2 , W. B. Graninger 3 , T. R. Pieber 1 Grundlagen: CD 4 + CD25 hi CD127 low/neg FoxP 3 + regulatorische T-Zellen (Treg) haben eine zentrale Rolle in der Regulation der Immunabwehr. In der Pathogenese von Diabetes mellitus Typ 1 (DM1) werden eine reduzierte Zahl und Funktionsdefekte von Treg vermutet. Die Wiederherstellung der Treg-Funktion k\u00f6nnte die Erkrankung verhindern oder verz\u00f6gern. Ziel unserer Studie war es die Anzahl, Suppressionskapazit\u00e4t und das Apoptoseverhalten von peripheren Treg in Kindern und Erwachsenen mit DM1 im Vergleich zu Gesunden zu untersuchen. Jahren und Gesunden (11 Kinder, 51 Erwachsene) wurden mittels FACS Analyse untersucht. Messungen der Apoptose und Suppressionskapazit\u00e4t von Treg wurden in vitro mit FACS sortierten Treg und stimulierten autologen Effektor T Zellen durchgef\u00fchrt. Ergebnisse: Es wurden keine Unterschiede in der Anzahl der Treg im peripheren Blut von Patienten und Kontrollen gefunden. Apoptose von FACS sortierten Treg war in Kindern mit DM1 im Vergleich zu Gesunden signifikant erh\u00f6ht [1,04 % \u00b1 0,76 % vs 0,45 % \u00b1 0,46 %, p = 0,029] und die Suppressionskapapzit\u00e4t von Treg war signifikant erniedrigt [44,4 % \u00b1 19,7 % vs 59,4 % \u00b1 16,6 %, p = 0,033]. Die Apoptose von FACS sortierten Treg in Erwachsenen mit DM1 war im Vergleich zu gesunden Probanden erh\u00f6ht [Median + IQR: 2,0 % (0,8-3,6 %) vs 1,0 % (0,5-2,1 %), p = 0,007], jedoch zeigte sich kein Unterschied in der Suppressionskapazit\u00e4t [38,2 % \u00b1 21,1 % vs 39,8 % \u00b1 15,6 %, p = 0,721]. Schlussfolgerung: In Patienten mit DM1 ist die Anzahl der peripheren Treg nicht ver\u00e4ndert doch es bestehen Funktionsdefizite mit erh\u00f6hter Apoptose. Die Suppressionsf\u00e4higkeit von Treg scheint mit dem Alter abzunehmen und in Kindern mit DM1 ist diese Abnahme verst\u00e4rkt, was auf einen altersabh\u00e4ngigen Defekt der Treg Funktion in der Pathogenese von DM1 hinweist.",

Grundlagen: Der selektive Immunglobulin-A Mangel (IgA-M) ist der beim Menschen am h\u00e4ufigsten vorkommende, meist beschwerdefreier, angeborene Immundefekt. Im Rahmen des Screenings f\u00fcr Z\u00f6liakie bei Patienten mit Diabetes mellitus Typ 1 (DM 1) erfolgt routinem\u00e4\u00dfig die Bestimmung von Immunglobulin-A, wobei die Pr\u00e4valenz f\u00fcr IgA M bei DM 1 sowie dessen Auswirkungen auf die Blutzuckereinstellung in der Schwangerschaft nicht bekannt ist. Wir pr\u00e4sentieren zwei F\u00e4lle von schwangeren Patientinnen mit DM 1 und neu diagnostizierten bzw. bekanntem IgA M. Kasuistik: Patientin 1: Bei einer 34 j\u00e4hrige Frau mit DM 1 seit 27 Jahren sowie bekannter Hashimotothyreopathie wurde im Rahmen der 2. Schwangerschaft aufgrund eines ausgepr\u00e4gten Eisenmangels trotzt Substitution und steigendem Bedarf an Schilddr\u00fcsenhormonsubstitution ein Zoli\u00e4kiescreening durchgef\u00fchrt, wo sich erstmalig ein IgA Mangel zeigte. In der Schwangerschaft zeigten sich geh\u00e4uft Blutzuckerschwankungen, der Anstieg des Insulinbedarf war geringer als erwartet und es kam geh\u00e4uft zu Hypoglyk\u00e4mien, wobei schwere Unterzuckerungen ausblieben. Aufgrund zus\u00e4tzlich vorliegender Myome war mit einem erh\u00f6hten Blutungsrisiko bei Geburt zu rechnen, woraufhin auf der Blutbank gewaschene Erythrozytenkonzentrate bestellt wurden. Patientin 2: Eine 31-j\u00e4hrige Frau mit DM 1 seit 26 Jahren kam erstmalig zur Vorstellung bei 1. Schwangerschaft mit zus\u00e4tzlich bekannter Z\u00f6liakie. In den mitgebrachten Laborbefunden wurde ein IgA-Mangel beschrieben, eine erneute Kontrolle best\u00e4tigte den Befund. Auff\u00e4llig waren starke Blutzuckerschwankungen sowie Hypoglyk\u00e4mieneigung mit gro\u00dfem Risiko f\u00fcr schwere Unterzuckerungen, trotz guter Compliance mit der glutenfreien Di\u00e4t. Eine intensive Betreuung bzgl. des Blutzuckers war notwendig, um die BZ-Zielwerte in der Schwangerschaft bei DM 1 zu erreichen. Schlussfolgerung: Ein zus\u00e4tzlich vorliegender Ig A Mangel k\u00f6nnte einen Einflu\u00df auf die Blutzuckereinstellung in der Schwangerschaft von Frauen mit DM 1 zu haben, jedoch sind weitere Studien in einem gr\u00f6\u00dferem Patientenkollektiv notwendig um diese Hypothese zu untersuchen. von Neutropenie, niedrigen CD4+ Zellzahlen und Infektionen w\u00e4hrend einer antiviralen Therapie mit pegIFN/RBV bei HIV-HCV Patienten B.

Es musste aufgrund der Neutropenie keine Therapieverk\u00fcrzung gemacht werden. Schlussfolgerung: Die generelle Infektrate in diesem Patientenkollektiv war hoch. Da wir aber keine signifikante Korrelation zwischen Neutropenie oder niedrigen CD4+ Zellzahlen und aufgetretenen Infektionen gefunden haben, sollten Dosisreduktionen und Therapieverk\u00fcrzungen aufgrund einer Neutropenie oder CD4+ Zellzahlabfall sehr genau \u00fcberlegt werden. Die Rolle von Wachstumsfaktoren wie Filgrastim (GCSF) oder einer bakteriellen Prophylaxe muss jedoch noch genauer untersucht werden.",

Systematisch erhobene Daten zur H\u00e4ufigkeitsverteilung von Treg in der intestinalen Mukosa beim Menschen sind bis dato nicht verf\u00fcgbar. Methodik: Bei 13 gesunden Probanden (Alter: 25,35 \u00b1 4,73Jahre; MW \u00b1 STAB) wurden eine Gastroduodeno-und eine Koloskopie durchgef\u00fchrt. Es wurden Biopsien aus dem Magen (Antrum und Corpus), Duodenum, terminalem Ileum, Caecum, Colon ascendens und Colon descendens entnommen. Die H\u00e4ufigkeiten von CD8 + -, CD4 + -und Treg in der gastrointestinalen Mukosa wurden via FACS-Analyse erfasst.Ergebnisse: Die relative H\u00e4ufigkeit der CD8+ T-Zellen war im oberen Gastrointestinaltrakt verglichen mit dem unteren Intestinaltrakt am h\u00f6chsten (Magencorpus vs. Colon descendens; 39,2 \u00b1 14,1 % vs. 13,1 \u00b1 5,2 %, p < 0,001).

There is a need to investigate the influence of long-term thrombin-inhibition on rate and severity of infections.Grundlagen: Bisphosphonate sind als Antiresorptiva bei onkologischen Indikationen sowie zur Behandlung der Osteoporose etabliert. Die orale Osteonekrose stellt eine seltene, schwerwiegende Komplikation dieser Medikamente dar. Sie wird als Bisphosphonatinduzierte Kiefernekrose bzw. \"bisphosphonat related osteonecrosis of the jaw\" bzw. \"BRONJ\" bezeichnet. Fragestellung: Gesucht wird eine Methode zur Risikostratifizierung hinsichtlich des Auftretens einer BRONJ von Patienten vor Einleiten einer Bisphosphonattherapie. Methodik: Ausgehend von einer Literaturrecherche werden Risikofaktoren f\u00fcr das Auftreten einer BRONJ identifiziert und gewichtet. Eine Skala wird entworfen, die die Zuordnung zur einer konkreten Gruppe hohen, mittleren oder geringen Risikos f\u00fcr eine BRONJ erlaubt. Anhand einer Patientengruppe mit manifester oder stattgehabter BRONJ wird die neue Skala \u00fcberpr\u00fcft. Ergebnisse: Eine eindeutige Zuordnung der Patienten zu einer Risikogruppe ist in allen F\u00e4llen m\u00f6glich. Schlussfolgerung: Die neue Skala erweist sich somit als verl\u00e4sslich. Weitere Untersuchungen sind notwendig, um das Instrument hinsichtlich der Inter-Untersucher-Reliabilit\u00e4t zu beurteilen. Das Instrument k\u00f6nnte dann wertvoll f\u00fcr prospektive Untersuchungen, z. B. im Rahmen der Pharmakovigilanz angewendet werden.

Eine getrennte Auswertung der kardiovaskul\u00e4ren Mortalit\u00e4t sowie eine zus\u00e4tzliche Adjustierung auf die Parameter Alter und Geschlecht f\u00fchrte zu keiner relevanten \u00c4nderung der Ergebnisse. Schlussfolgerung: Die Daten zeigen, dass besonders vWF-AG, Faktor VIII und t-PA Antigen bei Patienten mit mittlerem bis hohem Risiko f\u00fcr eine koronare Herzkrankheit zur Absch\u00e4tzung des individuellen Mortalit\u00e4tsrisikos geeignet sind. Es ist daher in Erw\u00e4gung zu ziehen, diese Parameter in die Risikostratifizierung einzubeziehen.",

Siebert Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Br\u00fcder St.Veit/Glan, \u00d6sterreich Grundlagen: Synkopen sind ein h\u00e4ufiger Grund f\u00fcr eine Krankenhausaufnahme, die Ursachen zahlreich. Eine Sonderform der neural-reflektorischen Synkopen soll hier beschrieben werden. Fallbericht: Eine 88-j\u00e4hrige Patientin wird wegen 3-maliger synkopaler Zust\u00e4nde innerhalb eines Vormittags eingeliefert. Fremdanamn. seien die Synkopen jeweils nach einer Mahlzeit aufgetreten. Bei Aufnahme pr\u00e4sentiert sich die Patientin ohne neurologische Auff\u00e4lligkeiten, im klinisch physikalischen Status auffallend ein Systolikum sowie eine bradykarde Vorhofflimmerarrhythmie mit 52/min. Das Labor nicht wegweisend. W\u00e4hrend der Anamneseerhebung erbricht die Patientin einen vor 6 Monaten gelegten Pylorusstent, der wegen einer Magenausgangsstenose (V. a. Narbenbulbus bei neg. Histologie) eingebracht wurde. W\u00e4hrend des stat. Aufenthaltes wurden trotz regelm\u00e4\u00dfiger Essenszufuhr keine Synkopen mehr beobachtet, die Abkl\u00e4rung mittels 24 h EKG bis auf vorbekannte bradykarde Vorhofflimmerarrhythmie ohne signifikante Pausen unauff\u00e4llig. So wurde unsere Diagnose einer Situationssynkope aufgrund eines gastrointestinalen Reizes, bedingt durch die Stentdislokation, gestellt. Von einer neuerlichen Stentanlage wurde aufgrund der problemlosen Nahrungsaufnahme vorerst abgesehen. Schlussfolgerung: Neural-reflektorisch bedingten Synkopen liegt eine Fehlregulation komplexer autonomer Reflexb\u00f6gen zugrunde, die inad\u00e4quate Reaktion auf einen Trigger f\u00fchrt zu einem RR-Abfall, HF-Abfall oder beidem. Die h\u00e4ufigste Gruppe stellt die klassische vasovagale (neurokardiogene) Synkope dar, mit 12 % ist die Situationssynkope (Miktion, Husten, Schlucken\u2026) vertreten. Eine genaue Anamnese und weiterf\u00fchrende Untersuchungen je nach Krankheitsbild, Alter und Komorbidit\u00e4ten f\u00fchren meist zu einer Kl\u00e4rung des zugrundeliegenden Mechanismus. In dem hier vorgestellten Fall konnte die initial vermutete bradykarde Rhythmusst\u00f6rung als Synkopenursache durch alleinige klinische Beobachtung faktisch ausgeschlossen werden. loop recorders are useful to eventually indicate antiarrhythmic devices in myotonic dystrophy 1 C.

Fallbericht: chronische Dyspnoe mit ausgepr\u00e4gter Eosinophilie. Vom Symptom zur Diagnose D. Schmid, M. Ortner, H. P. Gr\u00f6chenig, F. Siebert Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Br\u00fcder St. Veit/Glan, \u00d6sterreich Grundlagen: Bei Eosinophilie und COPD soll eine seltene Differentialdiagnose, die allergisch bronchopulmonale Aspergillose (ABPA) ber\u00fccksichtigt werden. Fallbericht: Die Aufnahme des 73-j\u00e4hrigen Patienten erfolgte aufgrund seit 6 Wochen zunehmender Dyspnoe. Der Pat war bereits ausw\u00e4rts mittels inhalativer antiobstruktiver Therapie anbehandelt worden. Bei Aufnahme konnte ein pulmonales Infiltrat radiologisch ausgeschlossen werden. Auffallend jedoch eine deutliche Eosinophilie im Differentialblutbild von 22,8 %. Gesamt IgE war mit 192,4 U/ml deutlich erh\u00f6ht. (Normalwert bis 100 U/ml). Trotz Aussch\u00f6pfung der parenteralen antiobstruktiven und empirischen antibiotischen Therapie kam es zu keiner wesentlichen Besserung des Zustandsbildes. Aufgrund einer Verdickung des rechten Mittellappenbronchus sowie einer Bronchiektasie im CT-Thorax erfolgte eine Bronchoskopie. In der dabei gewonnenen Histologie zeigte sich eine Schleimhauteosinophilie, in der bronchoalveol\u00e4ren Lavage konnten Streptococcus pneumoniae sowie Aspergillus fumigatus angez\u00fcchtet werden Die weiterf\u00fchrende Therapie bestand nun aus einer antibiogrammgerechten Antibiose mit Clindamycin, einer antimykotischen Therapie mit Itraconazol f\u00fcr 14 Tage, sowie einer Kortisonsto\u00dftherapie mit Prednisolon 0,5 mg/kgKG/Tag. In der Verlaufskontrolle nach 1 Monat berichtet der Patient \u00fcber eine deutliche Besserung der Atemnot, die Eosinophilie als auch IgE Spiegel zeigen sich nahezu normalisiert, und auch die Bronchialwandverdickung war in der CT Kontrolle r\u00fcckl\u00e4ufig. 43. Jahrestagung der \u00d6sterreichischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Innere Medizin 585 Schlussfolgerung: Die Diagnose der ABPA basiert auf klinischen Kriterien, die je nach Krankheitsstadium unterschiedlich ausgepr\u00e4gt sind. Die Therapie umfasst stadienabh\u00e4ngig prim\u00e4r eine Kortisonsto\u00dftherapie mit 0,5 mg/kgKG/Tag f\u00fcr 2 Wochen. Typisch ist der Abfall des Gesamt IGE um 50-75 %. Stadien 4 und 5 erfordern h\u00f6here Dosen. Zunehmende Evidenz gibt es f\u00fcr den gleichzeitigen Einsatz von Itraconazol Grundlagen: Bei Patienten mit Lungenrundherden und maligner Tumoranamnese besteht meistens die Verdachtsdiagnose einer Metastase und der Prim\u00e4rtumor wird entsprechend stadiert. Ziel: In unserer Studie berichten wir \u00fcber die H\u00e4ufigkeit der Lungenmetastasen bei Patienten mit Lungenrundherden und Tumoranamnese. Methodik: Bei 70 Patienten mit Lungenrundherden (45 solit\u00e4re und 25 multiple) und maligne Erkrankung in der Anamnese wurde VATS-Resektion und histologische Abkl\u00e4rung der Herde durchgef\u00fchrt. Die Lungenrundherde bei Patienten mit bekannter Tumoranamnese sind nicht immer Metastasen. F\u00fcr die pr\u00e4zise Staging des Primarius sowie Ausschluss eines Bronchialkarzinoms m\u00fcssen die Herde immer histologisch abgekl\u00e4rt werden. Grundlagen: Bei der obstruktiven Schlafapnoe (OSA) handelt es sich um eine schlafbezogene Atemst\u00f6rung, die mit repetitiven Sauerstoffents\u00e4ttigungen und daraus resultierenden, v. a. das Herz-Kreislaufsystem betreffende, Sekund\u00e4rmanifestationen einhergeht. Ziel dieser Forschungsarbeit war zu untersuchen, ob sozial schw\u00e4chere Menschen gef\u00e4hrdeter sind, an obstruktiver Schlafapnoe zu erkranken, als sozial st\u00e4rkere Bev\u00f6lkerungsschichten. Methodik: Im Rahmen einer Telefonbefragung mit insgesamt 200 an OSA erkrankten und in Wien wohnhaften Patientinnen und Patienten des Schlaflabors des Herz-Jesu Krankenhauses Wien, wurden unter anderem Daten zum Sozialstatus, wie Bildungsstand, Nettoeinkommen und Erwerbsstatus sowie zu OSA pr\u00e4disponierende Risikofaktoren wie Nikotin-, Alkoholkonsum und K\u00f6rpergewicht erhoben. Die solcherma\u00dfen gewonnen Daten wurden mit entsprechenden Statistiken der Wiener Bev\u00f6lkerung (Statistik Austria, Sozialbericht der Magistratsabteilung 24) in Bezug gesetzt. Ergebnisse: Die Ergebnisse der Datenerhebung zeigen, dass die befragten Patientinnen und Patienten einem niedrigeren Sozialstatus, als der Gesamtbev\u00f6lkerung in Wien, zugeordnet werden k\u00f6nnen; dies gemessen an den Determinanten Bildungsstand, Nettoeinkommen sowie Erwerbsstatus. Entgegen der wohl mehrheitlichen \u00dcberzeugung, lie\u00df sich auch in dieser Arbeit nachweisen, dass vermehrter Alkohol-und Nikotinkonsum kein schichtspezifisches Ph\u00e4nomen ist. Nachweisen lie\u00df sich hingegen ein deutlich erh\u00f6hter Body Mass Index in sozial schw\u00e4cheren Schichten, und so auch in dem von uns befragten Patientenklientel. Schlussfolgerung: In Zusammenschau dieser Daten kann die Schlussfolgerung gezogen werden, dass sozial schw\u00e4chere Menschen gef\u00e4hrdeter sind, an OSA zu erkranken. Prim\u00e4r daf\u00fcr verantwortlich ist die h\u00f6here Pr\u00e4valenz von Adipositas in diesem Bev\u00f6lkerungssegment. Neue Methoden zur Inhalation von Antibiotika bei cystischer Fibrose und Bronchiektasen T. Hofmann 1 , R. Siekmeier 2 , G. Scheuch 1 Activaero GmbH, Gem\u00fcnden, Deutschland Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM), Bonn, Deutschland Grundlagen: Mukoviszidose (CF) f\u00fchrt \u00fcber rezidivierende Exazerbationen (insb. P. aeruginosa) zur progredienten Lungensch\u00e4digung. Eine Antibiotikainhalation erm\u00f6glicht hohe Atemwegskonzentrationen. Voraussetzung ist die ad\u00e4quate Verabreichung durch Inhalationssysteme, die eine gute Atemwegsdeposition erlauben, und eine Eignung der Substanz zur inhalativen Verabreichung. Ziel der Arbeit war die Analyse von Studien zur Antibiotikainhalation bei CF-Patienten. Methodik: Bisherige Studien zur Antibiotikainhalation bei CF-Patienten wurden fokussierend auf neuere Verfahren ausgewertet. Ergebnisse: Erste kontrollierte Studien erfolgten vor knapp 20 Jahren in den USA, meist mit zur oralen oder intraven\u00f6sen Gabe zugelassenen Antibiotika. Studien fanden sich meist f\u00fcr Tobramycinl\u00f6sungen verschiedener Hersteller zur Verabreichung mit verschiedenen Verneblern. Dementsprechend variieren einzusetzende Substanzdosen und -volumina sowie Anzahl t\u00e4glicher Inhalationen. Eine Neuentwicklung stellt die bereits zugelassene Tobramycin-Pulverinhalation dar. Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen zu Colistin umfassen meist die Fl\u00fcssigkeitsverneblung, ein Pulverinhalationsverfahren wurde j\u00fcngst zugelassen. Ebenfalls zugelassen und mit verschiedenen Verneblern untersucht ist die Inhalation von Aztreonam als Fl\u00fcssigkeit. In den Entwicklungsphasen 2 und 3 befinden sich Levofloxazin (Fl\u00fcssigkeit), Fosfomycin/Tobramycin (Fl\u00fcssigkeit), Amikacin (Liposomen in Fl\u00fcssigkeit) und Ciprofloxacin (Liposomen in Fl\u00fcssigkeit, Pulveraerosol). Schlussfolgerung: Verwendet werden oft Fixkombinationen aus Pharmakon und Verneblersystem. Einzelne Methoden basieren auf Verabreichung von Pulveraerosolen mit entsprechenden Devices. Neuere Methoden weisen gegen\u00fcber \u00e4lteren k\u00fcrzere Inhalationszeiten und oft geringere Dosierungen auf, was bei guter Vertr\u00e4glichkeit und Wirksamkeit die Anwendbarkeit verbessert. Neuere Methoden der Antibiotikainhalation k\u00f6nnten daher zur weiteren Prognoseverbesserung bei CF-Patienten beitragen.Sonoelastographie zur Einsch\u00e4tzung der Speicheldr\u00fcsensfunktion beim prim\u00e4ren Sj\u00f6gren-Syndrom C.

Methodik: 35 Patienten mit prim\u00e4rem Sj\u00f6gren-Syndrom wurden mittels dynamischer SDS untersucht. Die Resultate der SDS wurden mit Hilfe einer visuellen Skala von 2 Untersuchern unabh\u00e4ngig voneinander beurteilt. Weiters wurden die Exkretionsfraktionen(EF) der einzelnen Dr\u00fcsen berechnet. Eine Pilocarpinstimulation wurde zwischen der 11. und 12.Minute p.i. durchgef\u00fchrt. Der Saxon-Test wurde am selben Tag durchgef\u00fchrt. Der XI diente zur Evaluierung des subjektiven Gef\u00fchls der Trockenheit. Patienten, welche basierend auf der visuellen Skala keine Speicheldr\u00fcsenrestfunktion hatten, wurden in Gruppe A zusammengefasst. Patienten mit verbleibender Speicheldr\u00fcsenrestfunk-tion wurden der Gruppe B zugeordnet. Es wurde so vorgegangen, da bei Verwendung der visuellen Skala kein signifikantes Ergebnis vorlag.Ergebnisse: 11 Patienten hatten keine Restfunktion der Speicheldr\u00fcsen (Gruppe A) und 24 Patienten hatten mindestens eine funktionsf\u00e4hige Speicheldr\u00fcse (Gruppe B) basierend auf der visuellen Skala der SDS. Die durchschnittliche Speichelmenge, die f\u00fcr Patienten der Gruppe A gemessen wurde, betrug 741 ml \u00b1 347 im Vergleich zu Patienten der Gruppe B mit 2179 ml \u00b1 737 (p < 0,01).

In dieser Studie wurde der Wert der SElasto zur Untersuchung der Speicheldr\u00fcsendysfunktion beim prim\u00e4ren Sj\u00f6gren Syndrom (pSS) gepr\u00fcft.Methodik: Prospektive Studie an 37 pSS Patienten [mittleres Alter 59 Jahre; 92 % weiblich; Krankheitsdauer im Median 3.1 Jahre]. Das Ergebnis der Speicheldr\u00fcsenszintigraphie (Szinti) wurde als Goldstandard der Speicheldr\u00fcsenfunktion herangezogen und von 0 = normale Funktion bis 12 = schwere Funktionsst\u00f6rung aller 4 Kopfspeicheldr\u00fcsen bewertet. In der B-Mode Sonographie und in der SElasto wurden pathologische Ver\u00e4nderungen ebenso mit Hilfe von Scores (B-mode 0-48, SElasto 0-16) bewertet. Die Interobserver Variabilit\u00e4t wurde bei 30 % der Patienten getestet.Ergebnisse: Der mittlere Szinti Score betrug 6,0 (\u00b1 4,3). Ein Funktionsverlust von ein, zwei oder vier Kopfspeicheldr\u00fcsen wurde bei 5,3 %, 17,5 % bzw. 19,3 % der Patienten beobachtet. Der B-Mode (corr coeff 0,65, p < 0,001) und der SElasto Score (corr coeff 0,39, p = 0,02) korrelierten mit dem Szinti Score. Patienten mit Funktionsverlust in zumindest einer Speicheldr\u00fcse wiesen h\u00f6here B-Mode [Median 27,5 (Spannbreite 10,0-44,0) vs. 12,0 (2,0-6,9) p < 0,001] und SElasto Scores [7,0 (3,0-12,0) vs. 6,0 (2,0-7,0) p = 0,032] auf als Patienten mit funktionst\u00fcchtigen Dr\u00fcsen. In der ROC Kurvenanalyse wurde eine AUC von 0,91 (95 % CI 0,8-1,0, p < 0,001) und 0,73 (0,56-0,89, p = 0,03) f\u00fcr die B-Mode Sonographie und die SElasto zur Identifikation von Patienten mit funktionsgest\u00f6rten Kopfspeicheldr\u00fcsen gefunden.

F\u00fcr die Szinti wurde ebenso eine geringe Variabilit\u00e4t der Ergebnisse beobachtet (kappa 0,871).Schlussfolgerung: Strukturelle Ver\u00e4nderungen und eine erh\u00f6hte Gewebefestigkeit in der Sonographie sind mit der Funktionsst\u00f6rung der Kopfspeicheldr\u00fcsen beim pSS assoziiert.Sonoelastography zur Einsch\u00e4tzung der Speichelproduktion beim prim\u00e4ren Sj\u00f6gren-Syndrom Ergebnisse: Eine 52-j\u00e4hrige Patientin wurde wegen einer intensivpflichtigen Serum-Hypokali\u00e4mie (1,6 mmol/l) mit Muskelparalyse bei einem Serum-Kreatinin von 1,3 mg/dl nephrologisch vorgestellt. Zudem war Serum-IgG mit 20,6 g/l (normal 7-16) vermehrt. Eine metabolische Acidose (pH 7,21; BE-17,5) mit normaler Serum-sowie positiver Urin-Anionenl\u00fccke bei einem Harn-pH von 7,5 deutete auf eine distale renal tubul\u00e4re Acidose (RTA-I) hin. Die vorrangig tubul\u00e4re Proteinurie (0,5 g/24 h) mit IgG-Exkretion und massiver \u00df2-Mikroglobulin Ausscheidung (31500 \u00b5g/l; normal bis 300) wiesen auf eine interstitielle Nephritis hin. Ein pathologischer Schirmertest (re. 1 mm; li. 0 mm) und ein pathologischer Saxontest (1,0 g/2 min) sowie eine pathologische Speicheldr\u00fcsenszintigraphie erh\u00e4rteten bei subjektiv seit 15 Jahren bestehender Xerophthalmie und Xerostomie den Verdacht auf ein Sj\u00f6gren-Syndrom. Dies f\u00fchrte zusammen mit dem Nachweis von Ro-und La-Antik\u00f6rpern und einer pathologischen Speicheldr\u00fcsenbiopsie zur Diagnose eines prim\u00e4ren Sj\u00f6gren-Syndroms als Ursache der schweren Hypokali\u00e4mie. Unter t\u00e4glicher Zufuhr von Kaliumcitrat/-carbonat (117 mmol K + ) und oraler Glukokortikoidgabe konnte eine suffiziente Symptomkontrolle bei Normokali\u00e4mie erreicht werden.Schlussfolgerung: Bei Hypokali\u00e4mie, Harn-pH > 5,5, metabolischer Azidose mit normaler Serum-und positiver Urin-Anionenl\u00fccke als Ausdruck einer RTA Typ I sollte, insbesondere bei Vorliegen einer Sicca-Symptomatik, urs\u00e4chlich an eine interstitielle Nephritis im Kontext eines Sj\u00f6gren-Syndroms gedacht werden.Evaluierung des Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) anhand der radiologischen Progression Grundlagen: Die ankylosierende Spondylitis (AS) ist eine entz\u00fcndliche Wirbels\u00e4ulenerkrankung.

In dieser Arbeit wird untersucht, ob der neu entwickelte und auch die objektiven Entz\u00fcndungsparameter (CRP und BSG) enthaltende Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) die radiologische Progression der AS besser vorhersagen kann als der BASDAI.Methodik: Es wurden die Daten von 58 PatientInnen f\u00fcr die Auswertung verwendet. Die f\u00fcr die Berechnung des ASDAS notwendigen Parameter R\u00fcckenschmerz, Morgensteifigkeit, globale Beurteilung durch den Arzt, Anzahl geschwollener/druckschmerzhafter Gelenke, M\u00fcdigkeit, CRP und BSG wurden retrospektiv aus dem internen Dokumentationssystem (RCQM) extrahiert. Zudem wurden R\u00f6ntgen der Wirbels\u00e4ule, im Mindestabstand von zwei Jahren, von zwei unabh\u00e4ngigen Radiologen mittels modifiziertem Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS) analysiert und die Daten mittels Spearman-Korrelation statistisch ausgewertet.Ergebnisse: Das mittlere Alter der PatientInnen betrug 49,5 Jahre (SD = 10,8), der mittlere Beobachtungszeitraum 3,23 Jahre (SD = 1,19), der mittlere ASDAS-CRP 1,99 (SD = 1,03), der mittlere ASDAS-BSG 1,99 (SD = 0,97), der mittlere BASDAI 3,85 (SD = 2,12) sowie mittlere Anstieg des mSASSS pro Jahr 1,32 (SD = 1,26), 87,3 % waren HLA-B27 positiv.Die radiologische Progression (\u2206mSASSS) pro Jahr korrelierte signifikant mit dem ASDAS-CRP (r = 0,243; p = 0,036*) und dem ASDAS-BSG (r = 0,289; p = 0,015*). Keine Korrelation gab es zwischen dem BASDAI und dem \u2206mSASSS/Jahr (r = 0,220; p = 0,052).Schlussfolgerung: In dieser Arbeit wurde gezeigt, dass der neu entwickelte ASDAS besser in der Lage ist die radiologische Progression der AS an der Wirbels\u00e4ule vorherzusagen als der BASDAI. to Clostridium difficile infection Background: This prospective cohort study was performed to analyse the effect of CDI on the risk of pre-discharge all-cause death in all inpatients with CDI compared to all inpatients without CDI during the year 2009 in a single hospital.Methods: CDI was defined as by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Data were collected using medical charts in CDI patients and hospital discharge data in non-CDI and CDI patients. The effect measures of CDI on the risk of predischarge all-cause death computed were risk ratio, attributable risk, mortality fraction (%) and population attributable risk percent. Co-morbidity was categorized by use the Charlson's co-morbidity score. A stratified analysis and a Possion regression model were applied to adjust for effects of the risk factors sex, age and severity of comorbidity.Results Background: We describe two linked cases of botulinum toxin intoxication to provide the clinician with a better idea about how botulism cases may present, since early diagnosis and treatment is crucial in botulism.Botulinum toxin is the strongest neurotoxin known. Although in industrialized societies there is a very high standard of quality control in the industrial food production, this is not the case in homemade or imported products which thus can be a source of botulinum toxin.Methods: We review the available literature the compiled clinical data and observations. Results: After a slow onset of clinical signs a married couple living in Vienna presented with dysphagia, difficulties in accommodation, inability to sweat, urinary and stool retention, dizziness and nausea. The performed general laboratory screening did not reveal any significant findings. They suffered intoxication with botulinum toxin type B. Botulism is a rarely occurring disease in Austria. In the last 21 years there were only twelve reported cases, none of which took place in Vienna. We present the first case of botulism in 21 years.Conclusion: Both patients went to a general practitioner as well as several specialists before they were sent to and correctly diagnosed at our outpatient department. To avoid long delays between intoxication and diagnosis we think it is crucial to advert to the complex symptoms a non-severe intoxication with botulinum toxin can produce, especially since intoxications have become rare occurrences in the industrialized societies due to the high quality of industrial food production. Background: This prospective observational multicenter study was conducted to investigate the age dependent epidemiology of pneumonia with a special emphasis on potential risk factors for mortality.",

            "text": "Methods: The present data were derived from the Austrian Pneumonia Network (APNET), comprising 9 Departments for Internal Medicine with a total of 1011 hospital beds. All inpatients diagnosed with pneumonia during 2011 were followed until discharge. Identification of microorganisms was performed according to local standard methods. Data of the two age groups (< 65 years and \u00b3 65 years) of patients were compared by Mann Whitney test for continuous and the Chi-square test for categorical data. Risk factors for P86 P87 P85 abstracts 43. Jahrestagung der \u00d6sterreichischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Innere Medizin 591 hospital mortality were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results: Overall, 1956 patients were included. Older patients a higher incidence of dyspnoea, pleural effusion and confusion at presentation. The overall all cause hospital mortality was 10.4 %, and was higher in patients \u2265 65 (12.7 %) than in patients < 65 years of age (5.0 %; p < 0.001). Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae was the most important pathogen in both age groups. Enterobacteriacaeae were revealed significantly more often in patients \u2265 65 years. Age \u2265 65 years, chronic heart failure and neurological disease increased the risk of hospital mortality 1.96 (95 % CI 1.19-3.20), 1.59 (95 % CI 1.10-2.29), and 1.7 (95 % CI 1.19-2.41) fold, respectively.Conclusion: Pneumonia patients with chronic heart failure, neurological disease and age > 65 years could benefit from intensified care due to increased risk of in-hospital death. Risk factors of severity (need for surgical intervention, intensive care or fatal outcome) were analysed in hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in a 777 bed community hospital. In a prospective analytical cross-sectional study, age (\u00b3 65 years), sex, CDI characteristics, underlying diseases, severity of co-morbidity and PCR ribotypes were tested for associations with severe CDI. In total, 133 cases of hospital-acquired CDI (mean age 74.4 years) were identified, resulting in an incidence rate of 5.7/10.000 hospital-days. A recurrent episode of diarrhoea occurred in 25 cases (18.8 %) and complications including toxic megacolon, dehydration and septicaemia in 69 cases (51.9 %). Four cases (3.0 %) required ICU admission, one case (0.8 %) surgical intervention and 22 cases (16.5 %) died within the 30-day follow-up period. Variables identified to be independently associated with severe CDI were severe diarrhoea (odds ratio [OR]: 3.64, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-11.11, p = 0.02), chronic pulmonary disease (OR: 3.0, 95 % CI: 1.08-8.40, p = 0.04), chronic renal disease (OR: 2.9, 95 % CI: 1.07-7.81, p = 0.04) and diabetes mellitus (OR: 4.30, 95 % CI: 1.57-11.76, p = 0.004). The case fatality of 16.5 % underlines the importance of increased efforts in CDI prevention, in particular for patients with underlying diseases.",

H\u00f6nigl 1 , G. Schilcher 2 , W. Ribitsch 2 , J. Horina 2 , A. R. Rosenkranz 2 , R. Krause 1 Background: Acute Liver Failure (ALF) is a severe illness, which can lead to multiple organ failure and death. Current guidelines recommend not initiating renal replacement therapy (RRT) in ALF patients with renal failure without liver transplant option. However, clinical data are scarce.Methods: Binational study of patients with ALF admitted between 2005 and 2010. SOFA and SAPS II score on admission, as well as mortality after 28d were assessed. For subgroup analysis, patients were stratified for liver transplant listing status. ALF was defined according to international consensus criteria (INR > 1.5 and presence of hepatic encephalopathy).Results: 79 patients with ALF were included in the analysis. Main underlying causes of ALF were paracetamol intoxication(19 %), viral hepatitis(19 %), non-paracetamol drug toxicity (19 %), amanita (14 %) and other causes (29 %). 40 % of the patients were male, median age was 49 years. RRT was initiated in 48 % of the patients. Patients requiring RRT had significantly higher SOFA and SAPS II score on admission, higher rate of hepatic encephalopathy Grade 3/4 and mechanical ventilation. Mode of RRT did not influence outcome. Higher SOFA score on admission and higher lactate levels on admission were independent predictors for RRT during the course of the disease in multivariate regression. 28d mortality in patients requiring RRT was 45 %. In patients listed for LTX, 28d mortality did not differ significantly in patients with or without RRT (27 vs 15 %, p = ns). In contrast, necessity of RRT was associated with significantly higher mortality rates in patients not listed for transplantation (65 vs 16 %, p < 0.05). Multivariate regression revealed vasopressor use as only independent predictor for 28d mortality in patients requiring RRT.Conclusion: Advanced severity of disease is the main risk factor for necessity of RRT in ALF. Although outcome in patients requiring RRT not listed for LTX is worse, RRT should not kept back for these patients a priori. ",
