Avian gammacoronaviruses can cause major health problems with subsequent economic losses in several commercially kept bird species, predominantly chickens (Gallus gallus). The genus Gammacoronavirus comprises not only viruses of domesticated birds, but also two recently discovered cetacean coronaviruses (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008, Woo et al., 2014). In addition, avian coronaviruses belonging to the genera Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus have been detected in wild bird species (Chu et al., 2011, Woo et al., 2009, Woo et al., 2012), but details on their pathogenesis and host range are yet unknown. In this review we will focus on the avian gammacoronaviruses of poultry, in particular on the role of the spike protein in the outcome of infection.",

            "text": "The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes infectious bronchitis in chickens. It is to date the most important and best-studied Gammacoronavirus and is therefore considered the genus\u2019 prototype. IBV was the first coronavirus described, and was discovered in the Unites States in the 1930s (Schalk and Hawn, 1931). Currently, it is worldwide present in both industrial and back yard chickens (reviewed by Cook et al., 2012, Jackwood, 2012, Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011). IBV principally infects the epithelium of its hosts\u2019 upper airways, which leads to respiratory distress, and predisposes for secondary bacterial airway infections (Dwars et al., 2009, Matthijs et al., 2003). Several IBV strains additionally show a subtype-dependent tropism for other epithelia, including the renal tubuli, the oviduct and parts of the gastrointestinal tract (reviewed in Cook et al., 2012, Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2000, Raj and Jones, 1997). This results in variable morbidity, mortality, pathology and production losses in poultry. The great diversity of IBV strains worldwide makes it difficult to prevent infectious bronchitis in chickens. The presence of IBV-like and other avian coronaviruses in other bird species (including turkey, pheasant, quail, guineafowl, partridge, peafowl, duck, goose and pigeon) (Cavanagh, 2005), complicates the field situation for avian coronaviruses even more.",

The structural proteins of IBV include the spike protein S, the envelop protein E, the membrane protein M and the nucleocapsid protein N (Masters and Perlman, 2013).

The classical subtype causing respiratory disease, IBV Massachusetts 41 (M41), was isolated by Van Roekel in the United States in 1941 (reviewed by Fabricant, 1998). Subtypes other than M41 also cause respiratory disease, but with varying severity. Respiratory disease is often clinically characterized by dyspnea, coughing, rales and serous nasal discharge (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). It is caused by infection of the ciliated epithelium of the upper respiratory tract (mainly nasal cavity and trachea), resulting in loss of ciliary activity, degeneration, desquamation and loss of these cells. In addition, infected tissues shows hyperemia and inflammation (Fig. 1A), which is mainly characterized by the presence of heterophilic granulocytes and lymphocytes (Fig. 1B). IBV can also spread to the lower respiratory tract and cause aerosacculitis (Bezuidenhout et al., 2011). Usually, the epithelium is restored to normal within 2\u20133 weeks via a state of extensive hyperplasia (Dwars et al., 2009, Nakamura et al., 1991, Purcell and McFerran, 1972).",

While some of these IBV- or IBV-like viruses display high sequence similarity to IBV or IBV vaccine strains (Liu et al., 2005, Sun et al., 2007), others strains are much more divergent and may represent different virus species (reviewed in Cavanagh, 2005). For example, turkey coronavirus TCoV is very divergent in its spike gene, and causes in contrast to the respiratory disease observed for IBV, gastrointestinal disease in turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). Swollen and edematous intestines with frothy content are the result of the observed severe enteritis (Cavanagh, 2001, Guy, 2000, Maurel et al., 2011). Quail coronavirus, which has a high spike sequence identity to TCoV, also causes enteritis with subsequent diarrhea and reduced growth in young quails (Coturmix coturmix) (Torres et al., 2013). In guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), guinea fowl coronavirus results in acute enteritis and pancreatitis (Liais et al., 2014). Other IBV(-like) coronaviruses cause respiratory and kidney diseases in pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) (Cavanagh, 2005, Gough et al., 1996), and respiratory disease and pancreatitis in pigeons (Columba livia; Qian et al., 2006). In wild birds, avian gammacoronaviruses are detected, but without clinical signs in the respective hosts (Cavanagh, 2005, Chu et al., 2011).",

Despite this, several in vitro and ex vivo models, in addition to in vivo models, are available. IBV can be cultured in intra-allantoically inoculated embryonated chicken eggs. The virus infects epithelial cells of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) (Fig. 2A) and the chicken embryo. Infectious virus particles accumulate in the allantois fluid, from which they can be harvested. Morphological changes occur in both the CAM (thickening) and the embryo (curling, stunting, growth retardation) (Loomis et al., 1950). In addition, ex vivo organ explants have been developed, of which tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) are most commonly used (Darbyshire et al., 1976). As read-out parameter for infection a scoring system for ciliostasis has been developed (Cook et al., 1999). Oviduct organ explants (Mork et al., 2014) have been developed to study IBV strains with tropism for reproductive tract. Finally, most IBV field strains grow on isolated primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK) (Gillette, 1973) cells (Fig. 2B), although adaptation may be required.",

The spike protein monomer is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular mass of around 128 kDa before glycosylation (Masters and Perlman, 2013). A cleaved N-terminal signal peptide (Binns et al., 1985) directs the S protein toward the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), where it obtains extensive terminal N-linked glycosylation (Cavanagh, 1983a, Cavanagh, 1983b). Around thirty potential N-linked glycosylation sites have been predicted for the IBV spike protein (Binns et al., 1985), increasing its mass to about 200 kDa. After glycosylation in the ER, the monomers oligomerize to form dimers or trimers (Cavanagh, 1983a, Cavanagh, 1983b, Delmas and Laude, 1990, Lewicki and Gallagher, 2002).",

All mapped receptor-binding domains (RBD), including that of IBV (Promkuntod et al., 2014), are located at various positions within the S1 domain (Masters and Perlman, 2013). The S2 membrane fusion unit of the ectodomain contains two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2), which interact to form the coiled-coil structure of the stalk (de Groot et al., 1987), and a putative fusion peptide. After endocytosis, conformational changes in the S protein are triggered by exposure to acidic pH in endosomes (Chu et al., 2006), resulting in fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane. In contrast to some other coronaviruses, no endosomal proteases have been elucidate to contribute to the infection of IBV (see also Section 6.5). Although the S2 domain is not principally involved in binding to a host cell receptor, the interplay between S1 and S2 might synergistically determine the avidity and specificity of virus attachment (de Haan et al., 2006, Promkuntod et al., 2013).",

The five neutralizing antigenic sites on S1 co-locate within three hypervariable regions (HVRs) (Cavanagh et al., 1988, Cavanagh et al., 1992, Moore et al., 1997, Niesters et al., 1987), suggesting the HVRs to be involved in antigenicity and hence serotypical variation. The nucleotide sequence of (part of) the S1 subunit of the spike has traditionally been used for genotyping (OIE, 2013). For diagnostic purposes, genotyping of IBV isolates is usually limited to the hypervariable amino terminus region of S1. As a result of the great genetic variability of IBV variants, a definitive nomenclature and genetic classification system is, however, still lacking.",

The average rate of synonymous mutations in the genomes of coronaviruses is about 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions/site/year (Hanada et al., 2004). The reason for the high sequence diversity of the IBV spike is unknown, but probably includes selective pressure, high virus titers and high viral subpopulation diversity (Jackwood et al., 2012). Intrahost selection of specific IBV subpopulations may be the result of the chicken immune response, affinity for host receptors and microenvironmental differences between organ systems (Toro et al., 2012a, Toro et al., 2012b). The emergence of new IBV variants is subsequently facilitated by the high basic reproductive number, estimated to be 19.95 (de Wit et al., 1998). The wide-spread use of live-attenuated vaccine strains and the subsequent selective pressure induced by neutralizing antibodies against the spike may force the adaptation of the virus to escape immunity, and hence result in faster evolutionary rates (as discussed in Jackwood et al., 2012).",

The occurrence of recombination has been reported for many coronaviruses, with so-called recombination hot spots representing regions in the genome with higher recombination breakpoint incidence. Such hot spots have been mapped for IBV to nsp2, nsp3, nsp16 and immediately upstream of the spike gene (Thor et al., 2011). The last mentioned hot spot is of special interest, as the S protein contains viral neutralizing epitopes and determines tropism. Hence, recombination of the S gene may result in the emergence of new strains, new serotypes, or even new viruses infecting other hosts. It was hypothesized that a one-time double cross-over event between IBV and a yet unknown other (avian) coronavirus upon infection of a single host led to the emergence of TCoV (Jackwood et al., 2010).",

TCoV is thought to originate from a recombination of IBV with a gene from unknown origin (Jackwood et al., 2010). IBV and TCoV full genomes are about 86% similar, while the similarity for the S gene is less than 36%. Extensive genetic variation in the S gene suggests that North American and European TCoVs subsequently evolved differently (Fig. 3; Maurel et al., 2011), resulting in the creation of different serotypes (Jackwood et al., 2010). The genome of guinea fowl coronavirus aligns to the TCoV genome, suggesting a common ancestor, but a current separate evolutionary path (Liais et al., 2014). The S1 of quail coronavirus has \u223c80% amino acid identity with certain TCoV strains, and only \u223c17% aa identity with IBV. However, as the rest of the genome of quail coronavirus are yet to be determined, it is not known whether quail coronavirus evolved with guineafowl and turkey coronavirus or separately. S1 sequences from coronaviruses detected in some other poultry species, including that of pigeon, partridge and duck, are much less divergent from the S1 of IBV reference strains (Fig. 3). It is, however, unknown whether IBV has a broader host-range than currently thought, or that these various bird species were infected by a number of yet uncharacterized IBV-like viruses.",

These results are in line with the previously observed binding patterns of dimeric S1 of B1648 and QX to oviduct explants (Mork et al., 2014) and other IBV permissive cells, including tracheal epithelial cells and primary chicken kidney cells (Shahwan et al., 2013). Similarly, dimeric Beaudette S1 bound to chicken cells (Hesse et al., 2012), while trimeric Beaudette S1 was not sufficient for binding to trachea (Fig. 4A; Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) and CAM (Fig. 4B; Promkuntod et al., 2013).

The N-terminal 253 amino acids of the S1 of the IBV Massachusetts strain M41, but not the C-terminal domain (Fig. 6A) had bound to cells in an \u03b1-2,3-sialic acid dependent manner (Promkuntod et al., 2014). Using the differences in binding between M41 and Beaudette S1 proteins amino acids 38, 43, 63, and 69, partly overlapping with HVR1, were identified as critical residues for binding of M41 (Promkuntod et al., 2014). IBV M41 is the only Gammacoronavirus for which the RBD has been identified. Likely important binding properties also reside in this domain of other avian gammacoronaviruses. The contribution of domains outside the S1 became clear when studying Beaudette spike binding (Promkuntod et al., 2013). While Beaudette S1 was not sufficient for binding to chicken trachea (Fig. 6A), CAM (Fig. 4B) and BHK21 cells (Fig. 6B), extension of this protein with the S2 part of the spike ectodomain resulted in binding to BHK21 cells (Fig. 6B) and CAM (Promkuntod et al., 2013). Interestingly, extension of the M41 spike, now comprising the complete ectodomain, resulted in an increased affinity and extended binding profile to the chicken trachea (Fig. 6B), and thus S1 and S2 might work together to determine the avidity and specificity of virus attachment.",

While M41, recombinant Beaudette and BeauR-M41(S) had the ability to produce progeny virus on primary chicken kidney cells, the Vero, BHK-21 and CEF cells only supported infection and replication of Beaudette (Casais et al., 2003). A recombinant Beaudette in which the S1 gene of Beaudette was replaced by that of H120 was recently generated (rBeau-H120(S1e)) and retained its ability to grow on Vero cells (Wei et al., 2014), indicating that the prerequisites for infection of cell culture cells resides in S2 sequence of Beaudette.",

In addition, replacement of only the S1 domain of Beaudette by that of the vaccine strain H120 rendered nonpathogenic virus that could be isolated from tracheal swabs till day 6 (Wei et al., 2014), indicating that the recombinant virus had the ability to infect and replicate in the respiratory tract.

A recombinant IBV composed of the structural region of the virulent M41 and the replicase genes of the nonvirulent Beaudette (Armesto et al., 2009) did not show any clinical symptoms after inoculation in chickens, and tracheas of all birds had 100% ciliary activity, in contrast to M41. No virus or viral RNA could be detected in the trachea of birds infected with the recombinant BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2. It is of interest to elucidate whether this virus can replicate at the inoculation site, and to determine whether the lack of pathogenicity was due to reduced fitness. Further evidence on the role of the replicase genes in pathogenicity came from a study in which the genome sequences of virulent and avirulent ArkDPI IBV viruses were compared (Ammayappan et al., 2009). Next to the spike, most amino acid substitutions were located in ORF1a. The proteins encoded by this region in other coronaviruses are known to have an immune regulatory role and determine the viral replication rate. Thus, they might be involved in controlling the host response to infection, or the fitness of the virus. The replicase region is, however, not the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity as replicase gene sequences of IBVs recovered from infected chickens were identical to those of vaccine viruses, with a lack of correlation with the pathotype (Mondal and Cardona, 2004).",

Binding of alpha2,3-linked sialic acids to specific lectins corresponded with the susceptibility of these cells to IBV infection, and desialylation by neuraminidase hampered infection. Our lab (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) and others (Mork et al., 2014, Shahwan et al., 2013) demonstrated that binding of recombinant S1 proteins to chicken tissues ex vivo (including trachea, lung, intestine and kidney) also depended on alpha2,3-linked sialic acids (Fig. 7A). In particular, glycan array studies revealed that the S1 protein of the IBV Massachusetts M41 strain specifically bound the di-sialodated glycan Neu5Ac\u03b12,3Gal\u03b21,3(Neu5Ac\u03b12,3Gal1,4)-GlcNAc (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011). Abd El Rahman et al. (2009) suggested that the observed variation in tissue tropism between different IBV strains might be explained by a difference in preference for specific sialic acids. In this respect, no particular sialic acid could be identified in glycan arrays applying S1 proteins of other IBV strains, including H120, B1648 and QX (data not published). This suggests that either these proteins bind with much lower affinities to the same sialic acid, or that they recognize yet other unidentified host factor, including specific sialic acids which might be not present on this array. While the results of Mork et al. (2014) suggest that binding of recombinant dimeric S1 proteins of IBV strains with different pathogenicity to sialic acids is comparable, our studies using trimeric S1 proteins indicate that there might not only be differences in binding characteristics of different spikes (Fig. 4), but also differences in the attachment profiles of the spike protein to tissues from different animals. For example, binding of the same trimeric M41 S1 protein to oviduct of broiler and layer chickens (Fig. 7B) showed remarkable differences in binding patterns, suggesting differences in attachment factor expression.",

For the murine betacoronavirus MHV extended attachment to O-acetylated sialic acids has been shown to affect cell tropism, resulting in increased neurovirulence (Kazi et al., 2005). The alphacoronaviruses porcine respiratory coronavirus and related transmissible gastroenteritis virus both principally use a cellular protein receptor, but the extended ability of the latter to bind to sialic acid is linked to its enterotropism (Krempl et al., 1997, Schultze et al., 1996). Interestingly, IBV does not express a receptor-destroying enzyme (Winter et al., 2006), which is in contrast to avian influenza virus and certain betacoronaviruses (Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler, 2006). To compensate for the observed lower binding affinity of the IBV spike compared to the HA attachment protein of avian influenza (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) other host attachment factors might be involved.",

This is a well-known receptor for many different viruses (Liu and Thorp, 2002), including a murine coronavirus MHV mutant with extended host range (de Haan et al., 2005). Upon passage in cell culture, both IBV Beaudette (Madu et al., 2007) and MHV (de Haan et al., 2005) adapted by the acquisition of heparan sulfate-binding sites, which enabled the use of heparin sulfate as alternative attachment/entry receptor. The putative heparin sulfate-binding site of Beaudette overlaps with a second furin cleavage site in the S2 domain (Madu et al., 2007). Madu et al. showed that the infectivity of Beaudette could be inhibited in the presence of soluble heparin or in cell lines lacking heparan sulfate, and concluded that heparin sulfate had a role as attachment and entry factor for Beaudette. Replacing the proposed heparan sulfate binding sequence (RRKR/S) in S2 by the corresponding sequence of M41 (PRRR/S), however, suggested that the heparan sulfate binding site is not crucial for entry, as infectious viruses could be recovered from Vero cells (Yamada and Liu, 2009). Using our spike histochemistry assay we demonstrated that site was also not required for the attachment of Beaudette spike ectodomain to susceptible chicken tissues (Promkuntod et al., 2013) (Fig. 8\n).",

An additional furin-cleavage site in the S2 subunit of the Beaudette was suggested to be involved in the furin-dependent entry and syncytium formation in vitro (Yamada and Liu, 2009). This corresponded with the observation that a productiveness of IBV Beaudette infection correlated with cellular furin expression (Tay et al., 2012). Yamada and Liu (2009) hypothesized a novel XXXR/S cleavage site in the IBV spike, corresponding to the position of the additional S2 cleavage site in Beaudette, for cleavage by other yet unidentified host protease. Such a host protease might contribute to the tropism of IBV strain, as it has recently been observed that Beaudette entry, while being furin-dependent on Vero cells, depended on a yet unidentified protease in chicken kidney cells (C. Winter, personal communication).",

Attenuation is based on the adaptation of a virulent field isolate to chicken embryos, with the aim of generating viruses with reduced virulence in chickens, while retaining the ability to induce sufficient immune responses to protect against a challenge virus. In attenuated virus strains, most mutations are observed in the spike and in the region encoding for the replicase proteins (Ammayappan et al., 2009, Mondal and Cardona, 2004). It is, however, yet impossible to predict based on a genetic sequence whether the IBV strain is sufficiently attenuated, while potent enough to induce and effective immune response. In addition, the use of attenuated live-vaccines poses a risk of residual pathogenicity associated with vaccine back-passage in flocks (Abro et al., 2012, McKinley et al., 2011, OIE, 2013). Despite this, live attenuated IBV vaccines are still the golden standard to protect chickens from IBV, as immune responses are high.",

            "text": "Delivery of spike proteins through the use of DNA plasmids or viral vectors to chickens has resulted in variable levels of protective immunity (Cavanagh, 2007). DNA vaccine studies show that the immunization of chickens with genes encoding multiple structural proteins of IBV can increase the level of humoral and cellular responses compared to the use of individual genes (Guo et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2009). In contrast to vector vaccines commonly used in the poultry field to transport and present parts of other avian pathogens (including Newcastle disease virus, fowl pox virus, and herpes virus of turkeys/Marek's disease virus), no such vaccine is marketed for IBV. Delivery of the spike using attenuated strains of other pathogens, including Mycoplasma gallisepticum vaccine strain (Shil et al., 2011) and recombinant baculoviruses (Zhang et al., 2014) showed only partial protection against challenge with homologous IBV. Vector vaccines might be improved by addition of immune-related molecules, as these can reduce clinical symptoms and viral RNA levels (Chen et al., 2010, Shi et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2009, Zeshan et al., 2011). Importantly, when cloning into a DNA plasmid or viral vector, the particular sequence of the S1 domain has to be taken into account, as already one amino acid mutation can reduce the ability to confer protection against challenge considerably (Toro et al., 2014a, Toro et al., 2014b). While most studies only express the S1 domain, recently Toro and coworkers showed that the S2 protein can also contribute to the protection against heterologous IBV challenge (Toro et al., 2014a, Toro et al., 2014b). Despite promising developments, viral vector vaccines and DNA vaccines for IBV still perform less well than existing live-attenuated vaccines.",

Vaccination with recombinant IBV Beaudette with spikes of virulent M41 (BeauR-M41(S); Hodgson et al., 2004) and 4/91 (BeauR-4/91(S); Armesto et al., 2011) protected chickens against a challenge with IBV M41 and -4/91, confirming the importance of homologous spike proteins in the induction of protective immune responses. Moreover, the presence of the S1 domain of IBV vaccine strain H120 in a Beaudette background bone was already sufficient to significantly decrease morbidity after challenge with the serologically related virulent M41 (Wei et al., 2014). The recombinant virus induced IBV-specific antibodies to a similar extend as the live attenuated H120 vaccine, and could result in fewer histopathological changes. Recombinant IBVs as vaccines are promising, as in contrast to vector vaccines and DNA plasmids they gain comparable levels of protection as obtained by live-attenuated vaccines. Future research of these recombinant vaccines will likely focus on the quantification of protective immune responses and the ability to induce protection against multiple serotypes.",

While IBV is primarily a respiratory pathogen in chicken, coronaviruses of turkey cause predominantly gastrointestinal disease.
