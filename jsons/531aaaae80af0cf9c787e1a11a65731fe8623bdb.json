Being open-ended, it is sometimes conceptualized as continuous with the external environment at its proximal and distal termini. The gastrointestinal (GI) system/tract is attended by an interactive complex of glands, tissues, and other organs such as the liver and pancreas. Functions of the gastrointestinal tract include ingestion, propulsion, digestion, absorption, secretion, storage, and elimination of excreta. Proper digestion and assimilation of nutrients is critically important for health and requires carefully coordinated muscular, secretory, absorptive, neurologic, and endocrinologic events. Importantly, a healthy alimentary system requires maintenance of barrier function. These functions are choreographed by one or multiple structural/functional elements acting in concert. Damage to one or more of the components of the alimentary system or its regulatory chemicals may result in pathophysiologic effects.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Alimentary tract lumens are potential spaces lined by polarized epithelium that accommodates ingested substances. This mucus membrane is smooth and shiny (with the exception of the rumen) when intact and healthy. The gastrointestinal system and its ancillary glands are the first line of defense against ingested foreign substances and pathogens of all types. The anatomic, biochemical, physical, secretory, and endocrinologic properties of the alimentary epithelium, resident and blood-borne effector cells, microbiota, genetic polymorphisms, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) (comprising one-quarter of the body's total) must be physically or functionally altered for dysfunction such as ptyalism (hypersalivation), regurgitation, emesis (vomiting), abdominal pain, gas production, and/or diarrhea to occur. In most cases, homeostasis is quickly restored without medical intervention. As a result, our understanding of this complex system has been neglected compared to other less well, self-regulated systems. The average human ingests 700 t of antigens in their lifetime.

Caustic substances, some pathogens, heat and electricity may result in thermal and chemical erosions or ulcerations of the oral mucosa, but mucus membranes heal rapidly. At various locations throughout the tract, extraintestinal substances are added to the ingesta. These include saliva that contains electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate, and iodine, mucus, which serves as a lubricant, antibacterial compounds such as thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide, secretory immunoglobulin A, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the digestive enzymes a-amylase, lipase, and kallikrein. Antimicrobial enzymes secreted include lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, proline-rich proteins, acid phosphatases A\u00feB, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione transferase, class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase, and glucose-6phosphate isomerase. Saliva also contains a bacteria-rich flora and at least in humans, opiorphin, an analgesic. A partial list of gastrointestinal protective mechanisms is in Table 2 . The esophagus is a muscular tube that passes through the neck and thorax and connects the oral cavity with the stomach. It secretes a lubricating mucus to aid in the passage of ingesta. The lining epithelium is keratinized in swine, equids, ruminants, rats, and mice and nonkeratinized in carnivores and humans. The epithelial cell turnover rate is 5-8 days. The muscularis is striated in ruminants and dogs, smooth in equids (distal third) that are unable to vomit, and variably mixed in other species. Mice and rats, that have primarily striated muscle in their esophagus, are also unable to vomit (Treuting et al., 2011) . This is principally due to a limiting fold separating the nonglandular from the glandular stomach and diaphragmatic crura that cannot be contracted independently of each other to allow propulsion of contents. Submucosal mucus glands are present throughout the esophagus in swine, dogs, and humans and at the pharyngeal junction in cats, equids, and ruminants. A serosa is absent in all but the abdominal portion of the esophagus. Because the serosa is composed of collagen, it is crucial in holding sutures. Therefore, esophageal resection is seldom attempted and rarely successful. The strong muscular contractions of the esophagus, together with its poor blood supply and lack of serosa, mean that healing from caustic or penetrating wounds renders a poor prognosis for a functional return to normalcy. Insofar as therapy for caustic toxin ingestion what burns going down will also burn coming back up, so generally speaking induction of vomition is contraindicated (Gelberg, 2013) . The contracted musculature of the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes to permit movement of the swallowed bolus into the proximal portion of the esophagus. After the bolus passes, the sphincter regains its previous tone. Relaxation of the sphincter and subsequent restoration of tone require precise control by regulatory systems that may be disrupted by toxins. When the bolus has entered the upper esophagus, an aborally progressing front of contraction of the circular muscle layer begins at the top of the esophageal body, seemingly as a continuation or extension of the forceful contraction of the upper esophageal sphincter that follows its relaxation (Conklin and Christensen, 1994) . A ring of contraction above the swallowed bolus moves down the esophagus, propelling the bolus toward the stomach. While the bolus is still progressing through the mid-portion of the esophagus, the contracted ring of circular muscle that forms the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes and is completely relaxed by the time the bolus reaches the gastroesophageal junction. The bolus traverses the lower esophageal sphincter and drops into the stomach. The proximal stomach (fundus and upper corpus) often relaxes, while the swallowed bolus is still in the esophageal body and has not yet passed the lower esophageal sphincter (receptive relaxation). After the bolus has entered the stomach, the fundus and corpus muscles relax so that a large volume can be stored in the upper stomach without significantly increasing intragastric pressure (accommodation). As the volume in the stomach increases, a subjective sensation of satiation develops (Burks and Villar, 1980) . In view of the importance of loss of body weight as a sign of chemical toxicity, it is surprising that so little attention has been devoted to disordered sensory perception of gastric fullness as a mechanism of toxicity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1795, "end": 1818, "text": "(Treuting et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}, {"start": 2789, "end": 2804, "text": "(Gelberg, 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3464, "end": 3495, "text": "(Conklin and Christensen, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 4437, "end": 4461, "text": "(Burks and Villar, 1980)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1185, "end": 1192, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Oral Cavity"}, {"text": "The forestomachs in ruminants and camelids are esophageal dilations and modifications.

Equids and some rodents have stomachs that are divided into proximal stratified and aboral glandular portions. Swine have only a small stratified portion that directly surrounds the esophageal os.

The parietal cells produce rennin that coagulates milk protein, intrinsic factor for vitamin B 12 absorption, and HCL. Chief cells produce zymogen, pepsinogen, and gastric lipase. Mucus cells of the surface and gastric pits produce bicarbonate and an unstirred protective layer on the cell surface. Gastric gland output in humans is 2-3 L day \u00c0 1 . The low luminal pH destroys many ingested pathogens, but there is a resident bacterial flora that cannot be cultured by conventional methods.

Although the cause of ulcers, other than caustic agents and those caused by bacteria that can survive the extremely low pH of the stomach (Helicobacter spp.), is imprecisely understood, conditions necessary for ulcer development include local disturbances or trauma to the mucosal epithelial barrier, normal or high gastric acidity, and local disturbances to blood flow, including stress-induced and sympathetic-nervous-system-mediated arteriovenous shunts leading to ischemia. These physiologic changes allow pepsin and HCl into the submucosa where they cause chemical erosion of the protective epithelium. In addition, exogenous or endogenous steroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) depress prostaglandin (PG) E 1 and E 2 decreasing phospholipid secretions that are gastroprotective. Gastric ulcers induced by alcohol consumption are dose related with effects ranging from a decrease in mucus production and bicarbonate secretion to leakage of bicarbonate and electrolytes to vascular damage (Rousseaux and Haschek, 2010) . Anecdotal evidence suggests that a propensity towards ulcer formation may be hereditable (Gelberg, 2016) . A partial listing of ulcerogenic chemicals is in Table 3 . Tobacco products increase gastric reflux, pepsinogen-1, and basal acid output while decreasing mucus production and pancreatic bicarbonate secretion resulting in duodenal ulceration (Hojgaard et al., 1996; Maity et al., 2003) . Mucus secretion is reduced due to decreases in total mucus neck cell numbers and neck cell mucus volume. Nicotine elevations in vasopressin, platelet-activating factor (PAF), and endothelin and reductions in EGF, PGs, and ornithine decarboxylase-related repair mechanisms contribute to the severity of the ulcerations along with tobacco nitriles and aniline derivatives (Florin et al., 1980) . Gastric mucosa damaged by exposure to high concentrations of sodium chloride can be repaired over a period of 6 h by migration of epithelial cells from the glands (Svanes et al., 1982) . Rapid epithelial restitution of the superficial mucosa is one of the primary defense mechanisms of the stomach, small intestine, and colon (Feil et al., 1989) .

Chronic administration of alcohol is associated with enhanced expression of a number of growth factors, including EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-a). These growth factors are thought to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury and may explain the observation that adaptation of the gastric mucosa to chronic alcohol administration is associated with increased cell proliferation and increased expression of mucosal EGF and TGF-a (Tarnawski et al., 1992) . The ability of chronic alcohol exposure to lead to hyperregeneration of the gastric mucosa could be responsible for the suspected carcinogenic effect of alcohol (Simanowski et al., 1995) . Generation of acetaldehyde, in addition to elaboration of growth factors, has also been implicated suggesting a potential role of gastric mucosal alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the deleterious effects of alcohol on gastrointestinal mucosa.

Capsicum has been used globally in food for 7000 years (M\u00f3zsik et al., 2007) and is especially popular in hot climates where normal dietary intake may reach 1 mg kg \u00c0 1 daily (Szallasi, 1995) . The popularity of capsaicin-containing foods in hot climates has been attributed to its ability to cause profuse perspiration, termed gustatory sweating (Lee, 1954) . A related compound, resiniferatoxin, was first isolated from Euphorbia resinifera, an African plant, but rarely is ingested as food or condiment. Capsaicin activates small diameter sensory nerve fibers in the mucosa and wall of the gastrointestinal tract to induce, especially in the oral mucosa, the sensation of heat, and pungency associated with spicy foods. Activation of sensory neurons by capsaicin promotes release of neurotransmitters from both the central and peripheral terminals of these neurons. The neurotransmitters released are principally substance P and CGRP. The peptides initiate a cascade of proinflammatory events and transmit nociceptive information to the central nervous system (Buck and Burks, 1986) . Repeated exposure leads to diminished effects. In high concentrations, capsaicin and related compounds can produce disruption of neural function and eventual destruction of sensory nerves in sensitive species. (Buck et al., 1981 Miller et al., 1982a) .

Animal studies, on the other hand, indicate that intragastric capsaicin, even in moderate doses, can produce changes in gastrointestinal function. For example, intragastric doses of 0.1 mg kg \u00c0 1 of capsaicin in dogs produces pronounced excitatory effects on colon contractions (Shibata et al., 1995) . The contractile effects of intragastric capsaicin in the colon are inhibited by a muscarinic antagonist implying that a cholinergic neural pathway is involved.

Activated neutrophils produce large quantities of OCl \u00c0 by means of myeloperoxidase catalyzed oxidation of Cl \u00c0 . HOCl is a powerful oxidizing agent. ROMs and lysosomal enzymes cause direct damage to epithelial cells. Leukotriene B 4 released by neutrophils is a powerful chemoattractant for additional neutrophils.

COX, the first enzyme in the prostaglandin synthetic pathway, converts arachidonic acid to unstable intermediates, cyclic endoperoxides PGG, and PGH. PGG and PGH can be transformed to prostaglandins, such as PGE 2 , thromboxane A 2 , or prostacyclin. Blockade of COX reduces formation of these prostanoids and shifts metabolism of arachidonic acid toward the lipoxygenase pathway, resulting in the formation of leukotrienes, most notably leukotriene C 4 and B 4 . There are two major isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, which differ in their sensitivity to inhibition by individual NSAIDs . COX-1 is the constitutive form of the enzyme found in healthy tissues, while COX-2 is an inducible form that can be stimulated by several cytokines and inflammatory mediators (Mitchell et al., 1993) . Most NSAIDs inhibit activity of both COX isoforms. Inhibition of COX-2 is associated with most of the beneficial effects of NSAIDs, while inhibition of COX-1 is associated with many of their adverse effects. Drugs that preferentially inhibit COX-2 may have fewer side effects than those that inhibit both isoforms . Inhibition of COX by NSAIDs results in two significant toxicological effects: reduction of formation of prostaglandins and increased formation of leukotrienes. Prostaglandins protect the gastrointestinal mucosa against luminal acid and other aggressive factors (Leung et al., 1989) . The protective effects result from the ability of prostaglandins to stimulate secretion of mucus and bicarbonate (Eberhart and Dubois, 1995; Sababi et al., 1995) . Reduction in mucosal synthesis of prostaglandins, including prostacyclin, is associated with mucosal damage (Whittle and Vane, 1984) . Prostaglandin E 2 and prostacyclin are also vasodilators. Blockade of prostaglandin and prostacyclin synthesis may favor vasoconstriction and oppose prostaglandin-mediated tonic vasodilation. Increased metabolism of arachidonic acid by the 5-lipoxigenase pathway in the presence of inhibition of COX is thought to contribute to NSAID-induced gastrointestinal toxicity (Peskar et al., 1986) . Leukotrienes C 4 and D 4 are vasoconstrictors, and leukotriene B 4 is a powerful chemoattractant of neutrophils (Bjarnason et al., 1993; Eberhart and Dubois, 1995) . Leukotriene B 4 -stimulated attraction and activation of neutrophils lead to release of lysosomal enzymes and microvascular occlusion. Epithelial cell damage is exacerbated by reduction in mucosal blood flow via a combination of vasoconstriction caused by leukotrienes and occlusion of microvessels by neutrophils (Kitahora and Guth, 1987) . Thus, NSAIDs reduce production of protecting substances and increase production of damaging substances. The theoretical advantage of selective inhibitors of COX is their lack of effect on COX-1 and endogenously generated prostaglandins and prostacyclins (Levi and Shaw-Smith, 1994; Seibert and Masferrer, 1994; . Preservation of prostaglandin and prostacyclin production protects the mucosa via bicarbonate and mucus production, mucosal restitution, and regenerative repair and helps maintain mucosal blood flow. Prostaglandins also decrease secretion of gastric acid by direct effects on oxyntic cell prostaglandin receptors, and lower concentrations of acid at the mucosal surface enhance mucosal restitution (Allen et al., 1993) . However, reduction of acid secretion alone is not sufficient to counteract the damaging effects of NSAIDs (Ivey, 1988; Wallace et al., 1993) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 929, "end": 952, "text": "(Mitchell et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1552, "text": "(Leung et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1695, "text": "(Eberhart and Dubois, 1995;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1716, "text": "Sababi et al., 1995)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1851, "text": "(Whittle and Vane, 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF274"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2243, "text": "(Peskar et al., 1986)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2358, "end": 2382, "text": "(Bjarnason et al., 1993;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2409, "text": "Eberhart and Dubois, 1995)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2726, "end": 2751, "text": "(Kitahora and Guth, 1987)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3008, "end": 3035, "text": "(Levi and Shaw-Smith, 1994;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3036, "end": 3064, "text": "Seibert and Masferrer, 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF226"}, {"start": 3465, "end": 3485, "text": "(Allen et al., 1993)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3594, "end": 3606, "text": "(Ivey, 1988;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3607, "end": 3628, "text": "Wallace et al., 1993)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)"}, {"text": "Ingested substances can activate emesis by two mechanisms, locally at the gastrointestinal mucosa and hematogenously at central nervous system sites ( Table 5) .

The vagus nerve is dense with 5-HT 3 receptors and innervates most abdominal viscera, including the gastric and duodenal mucosae (Ireland and Tyres, 1987) . Toxic chemicals can act either directly or indirectly at 5-HT 3 receptors to activate sensory nerves or act at other (non-5-HT 3 ) sites on nerve endings.

Presumably, activation of the central 5-HT 3 receptors enhances release of proemetic substances, thereby activating the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema and the nearby emetic center. Several cancer chemotherapeutic agents, most notably cisplatin, appear to act at least in part by effects in the central nervous system that promote release of 5-HT and subsequent activation of 5-HT 3 receptors.

Probably the best characterized of such receptors is that for the heatstable enterotoxin of E. coli (Cohen et al., 1988) . The E. coli enterotoxin (St a ) receptor is a novel transmembrane guanylate cyclase with an extracellular toxin-binding domain. It is expressed primarily in the differentiated cells of the villus. Similarly, cholera toxin specifically binds to a GM 1 -ganglioside receptor located on the enterocyte luminal membrane. Vibrio cholerae enterotoxin is a highmolecular-weight protein complex that binds to receptors that produce ribosylation of the alpha subunit of the G s GTP-binding protein regulating adenylyl cyclase activity in epithelial cells (Helper and Gilman, 1992; Lai, 1980) . This ribosylation prevents the alpha subunit from hydrolyzing bound GTP causing protracted G s stimulation of adenylyl cyclase leading to sustained elevations in intracellular cAMP (Kimberg et al., 1971) . The elevated intracellular cAMP maintains activation of protein kinase A and protein phosphorylation that inhibit intestinal mucosal sodium absorption while stimulating chloride secretion into the intestinal lumen. The sustained activation of adenylyl cyclase results from enterotoxin-induced failure of the G s regulatory system. C cholera toxin also affects pathways in the enteric nervous system altering both mucosal transport of fluid and electrolytes and intestinal motility (Jodal and Lundgren, 1995; Nocerino et al., 1995) . Pharmacological agents that interfere with nerve activity (hexamethonium, lidocaine, and tetrodotoxin) produce marked attenuation of cholera toxin-induced fluid secretion (Jodal, 1990) . The enteric nervous system is involved in the mucosal secretory response that produces a large fluid load in the intestinal lumen. Moreover, cholera toxin elicits migrating clustered contractions (also known as migrating action potential complexes) that are also inhibited by drugs that block neural activity. Cholera toxin appears to activate a neuronal pathway from the small intestine to the colon that induces secretion of fluid into the colonic lumen (Nocerino et al., 1995) .

The two major isoforms of NO synthase are a constitutive enzyme that is calcium and calmodulin dependent and an inducible calciumindependent form. The constitutive form is in the endothelium, nerves, and brain. It seems to continuously generate small amounts of NO. The inducible form is in macrophages and probably other tissues such as gastrointestinal and vascular smooth muscle and vascular endothelium (Moncada and Higgs, 1993; Stark and Szurszewski, 1992) . When stimulated by appropriate endotoxins, lipopolysaccharides, or cytokines, the inducible isoform can remain active for many hours and large amounts of NO may accumulate. NO is lipophilic and readily crosses plasma membranes to interact with the heme iron of guanylyl cyclase to stimulate formation of cGMP. Increases in intracellular cGMP decrease cytosolic calcium levels, increase potassium conductance, and evoke membrane hyperpolarization in GI smooth muscle cells and nerves (Stark et al., 1991; Tamura et al., 1993) .

Once released, NO is oxidized successively to nitrite and nitrate. It is destroyed by interaction with superoxide; SOD is protective. NO avidly binds to oxyhemoglobin by interactions with heme iron. NO can be inhibited by interfering with synthesis, by binding to hemoglobin, and by blockade of guanylyl cyclase. A number of substituted analogs of L-arginine, L-ornithine, or guanidine are competitive inhibitors of both the constitutive and inducible isoforms of NO synthase (Burks, 1994; Laszlo et al., 1995) .

Enterotoxins and exogenous protein-derived peptides can generate antigens within endosomes of epithelial cells. Constitutively expressed class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules within these cells can present the antigens to lymphocytes. The class II MHC molecules that permit antigen presentation are expressed on well-differentiated villus enterocytes but not crypt cells (Elson and Beagley, 1994) . Antigen presentation by enterocytes is associated with production of cytokines, particularly IL-1, a chemotaxin for neutrophils that activates neutrophils and macrophages. Activation of macrophages results in generation of IL-8, LTB 4 , and PAF. These substances are strongly chemotactic for neutrophils. Leukotriene B 4 increases the number of neutrophils in the area of antigen stimulation and increases local myeloperoxidase activity, a marker for neutrophil infiltration (Mitchell et al., 1993) . IL-8 directs neutrophil migration and likely synergizes with IL-1 in mediating neutrophil chemotaxis.

These chemicals are rarely ingested as food components. More often they are ingested as a result of direct exposure to pesticides and most often manifest as toxic responses to drugs. Acetylcholinesterase is normally responsible for inactivation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at synaptic and neuroeffector endings of cholinergic motor and secretomotor neurons in the enteric nervous system. Inhibition of enzyme activity allows local buildup of acetylcholine at cholinergic sites of neurotransmission and produces classic signs cholinergic crisis. The principal signs of acetylcholine overactivity include excessive segmenting and propulsive contractions in all areas of the tubular GI tract. This increased motor activity is caused primarily by actions of acetylcholine at smooth muscle M 3 muscarinic receptors (Caulfield, 1993) . Acetylcholine also acts at M 1 and M 3 muscarinic receptors to increase salivary, gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal secretions. Toxic amounts of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors produce net secretion of large volumes of fluid and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen resulting in profuse, watery diarrhea frequently associated with severe cramping. Natural inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase include physostigmine, also known as eserine, found in the ripe seed of Physostigma venenosum (Calabar bean or chop nut). A number of chemicals that inhibit acetylcholinesterase have been synthesized ( Table 6) . These include neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine.

The gastrointestinal system has a number of structures and functions that are in a delicate balance to effect digestion. Because the alimentary route delivers most xenobiotics, it is exposed to high local concentrations of these agents or their biotransformed metabolites directly or after uptake and biliary excretion. The GI system is quite plastic in adapting to dietary or altered metabolic demand.

Enteric neurons (green) and glial cells (pink) produce soluble factors that have differential effects on different intestinal epithelial cell types (enterocytes in light brown, intestinal stem cells in blue; Paneth cells in red, enteroendocrine cells in violet, and goblet cells in light green), thereby regulating IEB proliferation, differentiation, healing, permeability, and protection. (A) Wound healing. Enteric glial cells can enhance wound healing via the release of proEGF, leading to increased activity and expression of FAK. (B) Barrier protection. During infection by pathogens such as Shigella flexneri, enteric glial cells release GSNO leading to reduced CDC42 expression, and enhanced intestinal barrier resistance. (C) Proliferation and differentiation. Neurons and glial cells release mediators (such as VIP, or TGF-b1 and 15dPGJ2, respectively) that inhibit intestinal cell proliferation. Conversely, neuromediators (Ach and SP) can increase intestinal cell proliferation. (D) Permeability. Enteric neuromediators can differentially regulate paracellular permeabilitydVIP reduces paracellular permeability, while Ach increases it. GSNO from enteric glial cells can also reduce paracellular permeability by increasing the expression of key tight junctions associated proteins such as ZO-1.

Decreases of the latter three compounds result in decreased vasodilation within the gastric mucosa, predisposing it to injury. With the COX pathway inhibited, the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway is favored, increasing production of leukotrienes (LTC 4 , LTD 4 ) that promote vasoconstriction; coupled with decreased vasodilation, there is decreased gastrointestinal mucosal blood flow.
