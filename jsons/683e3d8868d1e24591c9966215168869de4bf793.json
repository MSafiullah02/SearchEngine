To investigate their potential role in respiratory disease, we determined their frequencies of detection, clinical presentations and epidemiological characteristics among samples referred for diagnostic respiratory virus testing. Methods: Anonymised samples and accompanying study subject information were obtained from the Edinburgh respiratory specimen archive. Samples were screened by nested PCR using two sets of primers conserved between WUV and KIPyV, as well for other respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenoviruses [AdV], influenza A/B and parainfluenza viruses 1-3, human bocavirus, B19). Results and Conclusions: WUV and KIPyV were detected in 10 and 14 samples, respectively from 983 specimens (from 9 to 10 different individuals from 612 study subjects). Infections occurred in two types of study subject; those who were young (<2 years) with lower respiratory tract infections (n = 8), and almost invariably co-infected with other respiratory viruses (RSV, AdV), and a second, generally older group either without respiratory disease (n = 6) or with mild upper respiratory tract infections (n = 5) but who were generally clinically severely immunosuppressed from leukaemia or transplant therapy. Findings from either group do not support an aetiological link between infection with WUV or KIPyV and respiratory disease.",

            "text": "Virus discovery programmes based on molecular cloning have been increasingly successful in the identification and genetic characterisation of a wide range of novel viruses infecting humans and animals. Examples of viruses infecting humans discovered by such techniques include the parvoviruses, human bocavirus (HBoV) and PARV4 (Allander FI-00290 Helsinki, Finland. et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2005) , anelloviruses (Nishizawa et al., 1997; Jones et al., 2005) , hepatitis G virus or GB virus C (Linnen et al., 1996; Leary et al., 1996) , following on from earlier discoveries of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (Choo et al., 1989; Chang et al., 1994) . While in many cases their discovery could be directly linked to a specific disease syndromes (non-A, non-B hepatitis for HCV; Kaposi's sarcoma for HHV-8), others have much more tenuous links with human disease. Indeed, subsequent investigations of their epidemiologies, transmission routes and disease associations have often proven to be major challenges. There is an ongoing effort, for example, to determine precisely whether HBoV is a significant cause of childhood respiratory disease, why it is so often co-detected with other respiratory pathogens, and whether it exclusively a respiratory virus (reviewed in (MacIntosh, 2006; Mackay, 2007) . Disease associations of PARV4 are even less well defined (Simmonds et al., 2007) . Recently, two new human polyomaviruses, WU virus (WUV) and KI polyomavirus (KIPyV) were cloned out of respiratory tract specimens (Allander et al., 2007; Gaynor et al., 2007) . They are related members of a new group (or possibly sub-family) within the Polyomaviridae, small DNA viruses with circular, covalently closed double-stranded DNA genomes infecting a wide range of mammalian and avian species. Polyomaviruses show narrow host specificities, and frequently establish persistent, lifelong infections characterised by highly restricted or latent infection. Infections with the two known human polyomaviruses, BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV) are acquired through the respiratory routes at a young age, achieving seroprevalences of 75% or greater by adulthood (Stolt et al., 2003) . Both spread systemically and establish sites of persistent infection in the kidneys and the central nervous system in the case of JCV. Disease associations of BKV and JCV are rare and are almost invariably associated with immunodeficiency. Lack of immune control of virus replication and the consequent greater likelihood of acquiring mutations in transcription control regions (Ault and Stoner, 1993; Chatterjee et al., 2000) triggers unregulated replication leading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy by JCV, and renal disease by BKV (Coleman et al., 1978; de Silva et al., 1995) .",

Investigations to date have been based on large scale screening of respiratory samples referred for diagnostic testing from patients generally with moderate to severe respiratory disease. It is, however, difficult to assess the frequency of asymptomatic infection with these viruses, or indeed, whether WUV or KIPyV played an aetiological role in the respiratory diseases of patients from whom they were obtained. In the current study, we have screened an existing archive of respiratory specimens with accompanying epidemiological and clinical information to determine prevalences of infection with WUV and KIPyV. The archive also included a sub-group of samples from children and adults with no respiratory disease, thus providing a control group to assess more critically their aetiological role in respiratory disease.",

PCR was carried out using the same buffers, enzymes and cycling conditions as used for parvovirus PCR (Manning et al., 2006) with nested primers to enhance sensitivity and specificity of the amplification reaction. Because the original description of WU and KI viruses described primers capable of detecting WU and KI polyomaviruses individually, two new sets of primers hybridising to regions of sequence conservation between the virus groups were selected. Set A comprised (positions in the published complete genome sequence of KIPyV [NC 009238] shown in parentheses) sense outer (480) ATCTRTAGCTGGAGGAGCAGAG, sense, inner (507) RTCAATTGCTGGWTCTGGAGCTGC, antisense, inner (782) TCCACTTGSACTTCCTGTTGGG and antisense, outer (815) CCYTGGGGATTGTATCCTGMGG primers, yielding amplicon lengths of 336 and 276 bps for first and second round amplification reactions. Set B comprised sense outer (2260) ACTRTTGGATGAAAATGGCATTGG, sense, inner (2299) RGGWAGATTGTACATWACTTGTGC, antisense, inner (2710) YATGCAAATGAATGTAACMAATGG and antisense, outer (2737) WTATATAGGCCTTACT-GARTTTGC primers, yielding amplicon lengths of 478 and 412 bps for first and second round amplification reactions. The 983 study samples were screened for WUV and KIPyV by combined PCR using set A and set B primers to test pools of 10 specimens. The 22 initially reactive pools were split into individual components, yielding a total of 24 repeatedly positive samples. All but one sample was positive with both set A and set B primers, the exception was positive for set A primers only. Of the positive samples, 14 were identified as KIPyV by direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplicon, while 10 were WUV. All sequences were identical in the amplified region to published sequences of these viruses (EF127906-127908 and EF444549-444554, respectively). Positive samples originated from 19 different individuals (10 WU, 9 KIPyV), yielding an overall case prevalence of WU/KI infection of 3.1%. This compares with case frequencies of infection by RSV of 14.7% (n = 90), by influenza A and B of 0.7% and 5.0% (n = 4, 31), by PIV1-3 of 0.7%, 2.8% and 0.3% (n = 4, 17, 2), by adenovirus of 10.9% (n = 67), by B19 of 0.7% (n = 4) and by HBoV of 8.1% (n = 46).",
