            "text": "In recent years protection of healthcare workers from cross-transmission of infectious diseases, particularly blood borne viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis B, has become extremely urgent and important to medical professionals l-2. Medical protective gear for doctors and nurses including gowns, masks, and gloves are currently serving as barriers to the diseases and are insufficient in preventing the transmissions of the diseases. Recent outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) have further indicated that the barrier materials may not be able to provide sufficient protections against this disease since a large number of SARS patients are healthcare workers. In addition, researchers have revealed that textiles are good media for hosting microorganisms and therefore, are potentially responsible for the disease transmission 3. Moreover, spreading of multidrug-resistant bacteria in healthcare facilities is threatening not only safety of healthcare workers but also publics. One drug-resistant microorganism, mecicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was found not only existing but also surviving for a long period of time on all of textile materials in hospital environment 3\u20135. No doubts, textile materials are responsible for disease transmission and spreading of the new strains of the diseases from the main sources to elsewhere 3. On the other side, textile materials, as necessary materials for clothing and daily life, are possible means for prevention of infectious diseases and pathogens, if they become antimicrobial. Thus, the research and development of antimicrobial textiles, particularly the medical textiles for healthcare providers and patients are important and necessary.",

Due to the allyl structure, ADMH forms its own homopolymer with difficulty, making it a good choice in grafting polymerisation, where the formation of homopolymers, which could consume as much as 80% of the monomers added, should be minimised 16\u201319. By using radical initiators such benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and potassium persulphate (PPS), macroradicals could be generated on most synthetic and natural fibres. The macroradicals can then undergo radical addition reactions with ADMH. As a result, ADMH could be grafted onto cotton, cotton/polyester, nylon, polypropylene, and even high performance fabrics such as Nomex and Kevlar.",

These are polyallyl or polyvinyl compounds, which can introduce crosslinking effect to the fabrics. The overall grafting reaction is controlled by carefully managing a combination of radical initiation on polymers over monomers, addition of macroradicals to monomers, and crosslinking effects from the additives.

Due to hydrophobicity of several polymers, the active halamine structures could not be washed off easily. Table 4\nshows antimicrobial results of Nomex fabrics after repeated washing and recharge. The antimicrobial properties on the Nomex fabric survived fifteen times laundry with minimal reduction of efficacy. After 50 washes, a chlorine recharge can almost completely restore the lost chlorine on the fabric.",
