Additionally, this study does not include any longitudinal follow-up as several patients are still hospitalised. Some patients in the non-ICU group might yet require ICU admission. We acknowledge that the findings in our study might not be generalised to other centres depending on the clinical algorithm implemented for ICU admission and ICU capacity and recommendations for the intensive care management of COVID-19 should be considered in future research.10 Finally, the comparison of the prevalence of obesity with the general population is based only on our sample of patients with COVID-19, and a population-based study would be needed to precisely assess the demographics of patients with COVID-19 with respect to the general population.",

Further independent multicentre studies including longitudinal assessment of outcomes such as duration of hospitalisation and mortality are needed to confirm that obesity is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and further analyses are planned on our datasets once follow-up is complete. These findings can help clinicians to better identify specific populations with higher risk of severe disease, which could lead to an increase in protective measures, proposal of serological screening for immunisation, and recommendation of a vaccination once available for people with obesity.",
