For example, they are fecund and light can control their ovulation. Spawning takes place frequently and no limitation in their spawning season. Microinjection of fertilized eggs is easily accessible and relatively cheap. Their embryos are transparent, making it easy to monitor the dynamic gene expression in various tissues and organs in vivo without the need to sacrifice the experimental subjects. Their genome sizes are approximately 20 to 40 % of the mammalian genome, making them the only vertebrates available for large-scale mutagenesis. Their maturation time takes only 2 ~ 3 months, which is relatively less laborious and time-saving for generating transgenic lines. In addition, many routine techniques of molecular biology and genetics, including knock-in, knockdown and knockout, are well developed in the model fish. Therefore, zebrafish and medaka are new excellent animal systems for the study of vertebrate-specific biology in vivo.",

Generally, around 10\u201320 % of treated embryos have a chance to achieve germline transmission [1]. It has been reported that a foreign gene flanked with inverted terminal repeats of adeno-associated virus can be used to enhance the ubiquitous expression and stable transmission of transgene in model fish [2]. Meanwhile, transgenesis can be facilitated by using the Tol2 transposon derived from medaka [3]. Transposase catalyzes transposition of a transgene flanked with the Tol2 sequence [4]. The efficiency of Tol-2-mediated germline transmission could range from 50 to 70 % of injected embryos [4, 5].",

The TALEN system involves the DNA recognition domain of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) and a nuclease domain for generation of nicks on DNA sequences. The CRISPR/Cas9 system directed by a synthetic single guide RNA can induce targeted genetic knockout in zebrafish. The main difference between these two systems is based on their recognition mechanisms. Unlike the TALEs applied in the TALEN system, the CRISPR/Cas9 system recognizes its target DNA fragment by the complementary non-coding RNA. The development of the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 systems provides new genomic editing approaches for establishing genetic knockout fish lines [8].",

Using medaka \u03b2-actin promoter, Tsai\u2019s lab generated a transgenic line of medaka displaying green FP ubiquitously around the whole fish from F0 through F2 generations in a Mendelian inheritance manner [20]. This is known as the first transgenic line of glowing pet fish, which was reported by Science [21] and Far Eastern Economic Review [22] and honored to be selected as among \u201cThe Coolest Inventions of 2003\u201d by TIME [23].

            "text": "However, some genes require a longer regulatory DNA sequence, such as more than 20 kb, to fully recapitulate the characteristic expression profiles of endogenous genes. In that case, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and phage P1-dereived artificial chromosome (PAC) have been commonly used for this purpose [24]. For example, the zebrafish rag1 gene, flanked with PAC DNA containing 80 kb at the 5\u2032 upstream and 40 kb at the 3\u2032 downstream, can be expressed specifically in lymphoid cells. Instead of using the tedious Chi-site dependent approach, Jessen et al. reported a two-step method to construct a BAC clone [25]. Employing this protocol, Chen et al. constructed a BAC clone containing the upstream 150 kb range of zebrafish myf5 and generated a transgenic line Tg (myf5:gfp) [26]. This transgenic line is able to recapitulate the somite-specific and stage-dependent expression of the endogenous myf5 at an early developmental stage. In summary, all the above transgenic lines should be very useful materials for studying both gene regulation and cell development.",

Shu et al. reported that Na, K-ATPase \u03b11B1 and \u03b12 isoforms have distinct roles in the patterning of zebrafish heart [30].

Furthermore, Hami et al. reported that a second heart field is required during cardiac development [33].

For example, Myf5, one of myogenesis regulatory factors (MRF), plays key roles in the specification and differentiation of muscle primordial cells during myogenesis. The expression of myf5 is somite-specific and stage-dependent, and its activation and repression are delicately orchestrated. Using in vivo transient assay, Chen et al. found that a novel cis-element located at \u221282/-62 is essential for somite-specific expression of myf5 [35]. Lee et al. revealed that this \u221282/-62 cis-element is specifically bound by Forkhead box D3, and proposed that somite development is regulated by the Pax3-FoxD3-Myf5 axis [36]. Besides FoxD3, FoxD5, another protein in the Forkhead box family, is necessary for maintaining the anterior-posterior polarity of somite cells in mesenchymal-epithelial transition [37]. The expression of FoxD5 is regulated by Fgf signaling in anterior pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM), which indicates that Fgf-FoxD5-Mesp signaling takes place in somitogenesis [37]. Furthermore, analysis of the loci of adjacent mrf4 and myf5 revealed the complicated regulation mechanism of the MRF genes. It was also found that the biological function of Mrf4 is related to myofibril alignment, motor axon growth, and organization of axonal membrane [38].",

For example (Fig. 1a), a strong repressive element of zebrafish myf5 was found within intron I (+502/+835) [39]. This repressive element is modulated by a novel intronic microRNA, termed miR-In300 or miR-3906 [40]. When myf5 transcripts reach the highest level after specification, the accumulated miR-3906 starts to reduce the transcription of myf5 through silencing the positive factor Dickkopf-related protein 3 (Dkk3r or Dkk3a) for the myf5 promoter [41]. Itg\u03b16b is a receptor of secretory Dkk3a and that interaction between Itg\u03b16b and Dkk3a is required to drive the downstream signal transduction which regulates myf5 promoter activity in somite during embryogenesis of zebrafish [42]. Dkk3a regulates p38a phosphorylation to maintain Smad4 stability, which in turn enables the formation of the Smad2/3a/4 complex required for the activation of the myf5 promoter [43]. However, when myf5 transcripts are reduced at the later differentiation stage, miR-3906 is able to be transcribed by its own promoter [40] (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, increased expression of miR-3906 controls the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in fast muscle cells through subtly reducing homer-1b expression. The homeostasis of [Ca2+]i is required during differentiation to help maintain normal muscle development [40]. Nevertheless, it remains to be investigated how miR-3906 switches its target gene at different developmental stages.",

The functions of Myf5 in cranial muscles and cartilage development are independent of Myod, suggesting that Myf5 and Myod are not redundant. Thus, three possible pathways could be associated with the molecular regulation between Myf5 and Myod: (i) Myf5 alone is capable of initiating myogenesis, (ii) Myod initiates muscle primordia, which is subdivided from the myf5-positive core, and (iii) Myod alone, but not Myf5, modulates the development of muscle primordia [44]. Furthermore, the six1a gene was found to play an important role in the interaction between Myf5 and Myod [45]. In cartilage development, myf5 is expressed in the paraxial mesoderm at the gastrulation stage. Myf5 plays a role in mesoderm fate determination by maintaining the expression of fgf3/8, which in turn, promotes differentiation from neural crest cells to craniofacial cartilage [46]. This research on myf5 not only reveals that it has different functions between craniofacial muscle development and somitogenesis, but it also opens up a new study field for understanding craniofacial muscle development.",

One is located at \u221263 to \u221275, which is the carp neural retina leucine zipper response-like element; the other is located at \u221246 to \u221252, which is a carp-specific element crucial to reporter gene expression in medaka retinae. Intriguingly, immediate activation of early growth response transcriptional regulator Egr1 could result in the incomplete differentiation of retina and lens, leading to microphthalmos [49]. Another important factor for ocular development is the ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6 interacting protein 1 (Arl6ip1). Loss of Arl6ip1 function leads to the absence of retinal neurons, disorganized retinal layers and smaller optic cups [50]. Upon losing Arl6ip1, retinal progenitors continued to express cyclin D1, but not shh or p57kip2, suggesting that eye progenitor cells remained at the early progenitor stage, and could not exit the cell cycle to undergo differentiation [51]. Additionally, it has been reported that Arl6ip1 is essential for specification of neural crest derivatives, but not neural crest induction. Tu et al. found that Arl6ip1 mutation causes abnormal neural crest derivative tissues as well as reduced expression of neural crest specifier genes, such as foxd3, snail1b and sox10, indicating that Arl6ip1 is involved in specification, but not induction, of neural crest cells [52]. Furthermore, they found that Arl6ip1 could play an important role in the migration of neural crest cells because in the arl6ip1-knockdown embryos, crestin- and sox10-expressing neural crest cells failed to migrate ventrally from neural tube into trunk. More recently, Lin et al. found that Ras-related nuclear (Ran) protein is conjugated with Arl6ip1, and proposed that Ran protein associates with Arl6ip1 to regulate the development of retinae [53].",

Taking advantage of LAMP, scientists discovered that miR-3906 silences different target genes at different developmental stages, e.g., at early stage, miR-3906 targets dkk3a [41], while at late stage, it targets homer-1b [40] (Fig. 1).",

They are able to modulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor Aa (VegfAa) and serve as cross-tissue signaling regulators between muscle and vessels. Since miR-1 and miR-206 share identical seed sequences, Stahlhut et al. demonstrated that they can silence the same target gene, such as vegfaa, and considered them as a single cross-tissue regulator termed as miR-1/206 [61]. miR-1/206 reduces the level of VegfAa, resulting in the inhibition of the angiogenic signaling [61]. Surprisingly, using the LAMP assay system, Lin et al. reported that the target genes for miR-1 and miR-206 are different [62]. While miR-206 targets vegfaa, miR-1 targets seryl-tRNA synthetase gene (sars). SARS is a negative regulator of VegfAa. Although both miR-1 and miR-206 have identical seed sequences, the sars-3\u2032UTRs of zebrafish, human and mouse origins can be recognized only by miR-1 in zebrafish embryos and mammalian cell lines (HEK-293 T and C2C12), but not by miR-206 [62]. Conversely, the vegfaa-3\u2032UTR is targeted by miR-206, but not by miR-1. Therefore, Lin et al. concluded that miR-1 and miR-206 are actually two distinct regulators and play opposing roles in zebrafish angiogenesis. The miR-1/SARS/VegfAa pathway promotes embryonic angiogenesis by indirectly controlling VegfAa, while miR-206/VegfAa pathway plays an anti-angiogenic role by directly reducing VegfAa. Interestingly, they also found that the miR-1/SARS/VegfAa pathway increasingly affects embryonic angiogenesis at late developmental stages in somitic cells [62]. It remains to be studied how miR-1 increases in abundance at late stage.",

During definitive hematopoiesis, runx1 marks hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in both mouse and fish. Additionally, in differentiated populations, gata1, the erythroid lineage regulator, pu.1 and c/ebp, the myeloid lineage regulators, and ikaros, a mark of the lymphoid population, are in accordance with the hematopoietic hierarchy in zebrafish and mammals [68].

For example, it is well known that prostaglandin (PG) E2 increases the induction of stem cells in the aorta\u2013gonad\u2013mesonephros region of zebrafish, as demonstrated by increasing expressions of runx1 and cmyb, which, in turn, increases engraftment of murine marrow in experimental transplantation [71].

Thus, transgenic fish with heart-specific fluorescence could provide a high-through screening platform for drugs for cardiovascular disease. For example, the Tsai\u2019s lab established a transgenic line which could be induced to knock down the expression level of cardiac troponin C at any developmental stage, including embryos, larva or adult fish. The reduction of troponin C resulted in mimicry of dilated cardiomyopathy, and the incomplete atrioventricular blocking disease in humans.

Zebrafish is again an alternative organism for in vivo cancer biology studies. In particular, xenotransplantation of human cancer cells into zebrafish embryos serves as an alternative approach for evaluating cancer progression and drug screening [89]. For example, human primary tumor cells labeled with fluorescence have already been implanted in zebrafish liver, and the invasiveness and metastasis of these cells were directly observable and easily traceable [90]. To investigate the mechanism of local cancer cell invasion, human glioblastoma cells labeled with fluorescence were infiltrated into the brain of zebrafish embryos. It was observed that the injected cells aligned along the abluminal surface of brain blood vessels [91]. By grafting a small amount of highly metastatic human breast carcinoma cells onto the pericardial membrane of zebrafish embryos at 48 hpf, tumor cells were observed to move longitudinally along the aorta [92]. Similarly, highly metastatic human cancer cells labeled with fluorescence were injected into the pericardium of 48-hpf embryos. Afterwards, it is possible to visualize how cancer cells entered the blood circulation and arrested in small vessels in head and tail [93]. In another example, zebrafish embryos were injected with tumorigenic human glioma stem cells at different stages of metastasis, including beginning, approaching, clustering, invading, migrating, and transmigrating [94]. Thus, grafting a small number of labeled tumor cells into transparent zebrafish embryos allows us to dynamically monitor the cancer cells without the interference of immune suppression.",

Interestingly, the developmental processes and genes related to hematopoiesis are similar between zebrafish and humans, making zebrafish a feasible model for the study of leukemia. In addition, gene expression in zebrafish could be conveniently modified by several approaches, e.g., MO-induced gene knockdown, TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout, and DNA/RNA introduced overexpression [6, 7]. In the study of Yeh et al. [97], the zebrafish model was applied to screen for chemical modifiers of AML1-ETO, an oncogenic fusion protein prevalent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatment of zebrafish with chemical modifiers of AML1-ETO resulted in hematopoietic dysregulation and elicited a malignant phenotype similar to human AML.

            "text": "FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase which is normally expressed in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) [98]. Internal tandem duplication (ITD), which may occur at either the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) or the tyrosine kinase domain (TKDs) of FLT3, is observed in one-third of human AML. Zebrafish Flt3 shares an overall 32, 35, and 34% sequence identity with that of human, mouse, and rat, respectively. However, the JMD and the activation loops of TKD are highly conserved, implicating that the functions of FLT3 signaling are evolutionally conserved. Overexpression of human FLT3-ITD in zebrafish embryos induces the ectopic expansion of FLT3-ITD positive myeloid cells. If those embryos are treated with AC220, a potent and relatively selective inhibitor of FLT3, FLT3-ITD myeloid expansion is effectively ameliorated [99]. In another example, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 are involved in citric acid cycle in intermediary metabolism. IDH mutations are found in approximately 30 % of cytogenetically abnormal AML, suggesting a pathogenetic link in leukemia initiation [100, 101]. Injection of either human IDH1-R132H or zebrafish idh1-R146H, a mutant corresponding to human IDH1-R132H, resulted in increased 2-hydroxyglutarate, which in turn induced the expansion of primitive myelopoiesis [102]. Taken together, these reports suggest that the molecular pathways involved in leukemia are conserved between humans and zebrafish. Based on the aforementioned experimental evidence, zebrafish can be an exceptional platform for mimicking human myelodysplastic syndromes and establishing an in vivo vertebrate model for drug screening.",

Furthermore, since behavioral test of zebrafish for cognitive, approach-avoidance, and social paradigms are available, the identification of depression-like indices in response to physiological, genetic, environmental, and/or psychopharmacological alterations is feasible [110]. Actually, zebrafish display highly robust phenotypes of neurobehavioral disorders such as anxiety-like and approach\u2013avoidance behaviors. Furthermore, novel information of behavioral indices can be exposed, including geotaxis via top-bottom vertical movement [111]. Zebrafish behavior can also be monitored using automated behavioral tracking software, which enhances efficiency and reduces interrater variance [112]. Additionally, zebrafish offer a potential insight into the social aspects of depression [113] and may be suitable for studying the cognitive deficits of depression [114] and its putative etiological pathways [115].

These studies mainly focused on mortality and abnormality rates. However, the developing embryos may have already been damaged in a subtle way that would have precluded direct observation of morphology and detection of mortality. To overcome this drawback, transgenic fish can be used because they are designed to study (a) whether toxicants cause defective genes during embryogenesis; (b) whether pollutants affect the expression of tissue-specific gene; and (c) whether the impact of pollutants on embryonic development is dosage dependent. Pollutants can be directly detected by simply observing the coloration change of cells before or after the pollutants can cause morphological damage. Therefore, transgenic model fish are promising organisms for use as bioindicators to environmental toxicants and mutagens [120, 121]. In addition, Chen and Lu reported that the environmental xenobiotics can be detected by a transgenic line of medaka carrying a GFP reporter driven by cytochrome P450 1a promoter (CYP1A-GFP) [122]. Furthermore, the environmental xenoestrogenic compounds can be specifically detected by a hybrid transgenic line derived from crossing between line CYP1A-GFP and line VG-Lux whose Lux reporter activity is driven by a vitellogenin promoter [123]. Lee et al. reported another zebrafish transgenic line, termed huORFZ [54], as it has been described in pervious section . At normal condition, the translation of the transferred huORFchop-gfp mRNA in huORFZ embryos is completely suppressed by an inhibitory uORF of human chop mRNA (huORFchop). However, when the huORFZ embryos were under ER stress, such as heat shock, cold shock, hypoxia, metals, alcohol, toxicants or drugs, the downstream GFP became apparent due to the blockage of huORFchop-mediated translation inhibition. Therefore, huORFZ embryos can be used to study the mechanism of translational inhibition. Additionally, huORFZ embryos can serve a living material to monitor the contamination of hazardous pollutants [124]. Besides the universal huORFZ system, zebrafish could also be indicators for specific pollutants. For example, Xu et al. reported a transgenic zebrafish Tg (cyp1a:gfp) which can serve as an in vivo assay for screening xenobiotic compounds, since Cyp1a is involved in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway, and can be induced in the presence of Dioxins/Dioxin-like compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [125]. Additional advantages of zebrafish include the small size, abundant number, rapid development and transparent eggs. These features make this model fish more accessible for the studies of molecular toxicology.",

It provides a simple, yet effective, in vivo approach to identify regulatory DNA sequences, as well as determine gene function and molecular pathways. More importantly, an increasing number of papers have reported that (a) the defective phenotype of mutants of model fish can photocopy with known human disorders; and (b) drugs have similar effects on zebrafish and mammalian systems. Therefore, the transgenic fish model offers a useful platform for high-throughput drug screening in biomedical sciences.

First, unlike mammals, fish lack the heart septation, lung, mammary gland, prostate gland and limbs, which make the fish model impossible for studies of these tissues and organs. Additionally, fish are absent of placenta so that fish embryos are directly exposed to the environment (e.g., drugs or pollutants) without involving the placenta. Second, fish are poikilothermic and usually maintained below 30 \u00b0C, which may not be optimal for those mammalian agents adapted for 37 \u00b0C in evolution. Last, since the zebrafish genome is tetraploid, it is less straight forward to conduct loss-of-function studies for certain genes.",

When myf5 is highly transcribed, the intronic miR-3906 suppresses the transcription of myf5 through silencing the Dkk3a [39, 41\u201343]. b At the late muscle development, miR-3906 starts transcription at its own promoter and switches to silence homer1b to control the homeostasis of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in fast muscle cells [40]. Either miR-3906-knockdown or homer-1b-overexpression causes the increase of Homer-1b protein, resulting in an enhanced level of [Ca2+]i, which in turn, disrupts sarcomeric actin filament organization. In contrast, either miR-3906-overexpression or homer-1b-knockdown causes the decrease of Homer-1b, resulting in a reduced [Ca2+]i and thus a defective muscle phenotype [40]",

Both miR-1 and miR-206 are muscle-specific microRNAs and share identical seed sequences. However, they silence different target genes to affect the secreted VegfAa level through different pathways [62]. The miR-1/SARS/VegfAa pathway plays a positive role in angiogenesis since SARS, a negative factor for VegfAa promoter transcription, is silenced by miR-1, resulting in the increase of VegfAa. However, the miR-206/VegfAa pathway plays a negative role since VegfAa is silenced directly by miR-206. Dynamic changes of miR-1 and miR-206 levels are also observed [62]. The miR-1 level gradually increases between 12 and 20 hpf and significantly increases further between 20 and 32 hpf, while the miR-206 level is only slightly changed during this same period. Consequently, VegfAa increases greatly from 24 to 30 hpf, which might be responsible for the continuous increase of miR-1/SARS/VegfAa pathway, but not miR-206/VegfAa pathway. Therefore, temporal regulation of the expression of miR-1 and miR-206 with different target genes occur during embryonic angiogenesis in somitic cells of zebrafish",
