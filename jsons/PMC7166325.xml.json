In addition, CREB has been shown to regulate several target genes, including COX\u20102 [Desdouets et al., 1995; Ahn et al., 1998; Impey et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005; White et al., 2006; Klein et al., 2007]. Therefore, we first determined whether EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression was mediated through CREB signaling in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells.

To verify the transcriptional regulation of COX\u20102 gene in this context, SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter vector containing an exogenous COX\u20102 promoter, and the cells were then stimulated with EV71 (moi = 5) for 16 h. As shown in Figure 1E, EV71 infection stimulated COX\u20102 promoter activity which was attenuated by H89. To verify whether the CREB\u2010binding site CRE was required for these responses, the cells were transfected with a mutated COX\u20102 promoter. As shown in Figure 1F, EV71\u2010stimulated COX\u20102 promoter activity was decreased by transfection with a mutated CRE (Mt\u2010CRE) in the COX\u20102 promoter, suggesting that CREB was required for EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression. Moreover, EV71 stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB in a time\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 1G). In this case, a maximal response was obtained within 30\u201345 min and then declined to the basal level within 60 min (Fig. 1G). The phosphorylation of CREB was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with H89 (Fig. 1H). In addition, we compared the effects of EV71 and UV\u2010irradiated EV71 (EV71 was irradiated with 365\u2010nm UV light for 30 min in a 10\u2010cm dish) on these responses. UV\u2010irradiated EV71 could also induce the activation of CREB, indicating that CREB activation required virus binding and entry into the cell, while activation was independent of viral replication (data not shown). These results suggested that the expression of COX\u20102 and the production of PGE2 induced by EV71 infection required CREB signaling in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells.",

We had previously demonstrated that EV71 induced COX\u20102 expression and PGE2 production via MAPKs (p42/p44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and JNK1/2), thereby linking EV71 infection with the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB and AP\u20101 in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells [Tung et al., 2010]. However, CREB was also known to play an important role in COX\u20102 expression in various cell types [Desdouets et al., 1995; Ahn et al., 1998; Lonze et al., 2002; Impey et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005; White et al., 2006; Klein et al., 2007]. Previous studies have also reported that viral infection regulates CREB activation [Lallemand et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007b]. In the present study, our results demonstrated that EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression was mediated by a cascade implicating c\u2010Src/EGFR/p42/p44 MAPK/CREB in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells. Based on our findings, we propose a model for the activation of the signaling molecules implicated with COX\u20102 expression in response to EV71 infection in human neuron cells (Fig. 7).",

These processes could be illustrated by the observation that pretreatment of SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells with H89 attenuated EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression and PGE2 production. In addition, transfection with CREB siRNA also significantly reduced EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression (Fig. 1A\u2013D). We also used a CRE\u2010(MtCRE)\u2010mutated COX\u20102 promoter and demonstrated that mutants of CRE\u2010binding site significantly blocked EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 promoter activity (Fig. 1F). We also demonstrated that EV71 infection stimulated CREB activation, while this effect was diminished by pretreatment with H89, suggesting that CREB was involved in EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells (Fig. 1G and H). These results are consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that protein S from SARS\u2010CoV regulates COX\u20102 expression through the CREB pathway in HEK293T, COS\u20107, or A549 cells [Liu et al., 2007b].",

In the present study, the activation of CREB by EV71 infection was blocked by pretreatment with AG1478, suggesting that EV71 induced CREB activation in an EGFR\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Previous studies have reported that PP1 blocks EGFR transactivation stimulated by glucagon\u2010like peptide 1 in pancreatic \u03b2\u2010cells [Ohtsu et al., 2006]. Our results indicated that c\u2010Src was involved in EV71\u2010induced EGFR and CREB activation since pretreatment with PP1 attenuated the phosphorylation of these signaling proteins. In addition, we demonstrated that EV71 activated the association of c\u2010Src and EGFR, which was blocked by pretreatment with either AG1478 or PP1 (Fig. 2E and F). Therefore, transactivation of EGFR could represent one of the basic mechanisms underlying the mitogenic activity of EV71 in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells. Moreover, COX\u20102 protein expression, PGE2 production, COX\u20102 mRNA synthesis, and COX\u20102 promoter activity were induced by EV71 infection, which were inhibited by pretreatment with AG1478, an EGFR\u2010neutralizing antibody, PP1, or transfection with c\u2010Src siRNA (Fig. 3A\u2013F). These results suggest that EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression is mediated through a c\u2010Src/EGFR/CREB signaling pathway in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells.",

In the present study, pretreatment of SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells with AG1478 inhibited EV71\u2010stimulated p42/p44 phosphorylation, indicating that activation of EGFR was required for this cellular response (Fig. 4A). However, the phosphorylation of CREB induced by EV71 infection was blocked by pretreatment with U0126 (Fig. 4B), but not by treatment with other MAPK inhibitors, such as SB203580 (inhibitor of p38 MAPK) and SP600125 (inhibitor of JNK1/2) (data not shown). These results were consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that the total cell number of both Rat\u20102 fibroblast cells and BrdU\u2010positive cells increased following treatment with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) via a p42/p44 MAPK/CREB pathway [Kwon et al., 2009]. We suggested that activation of the p42/p44 MAPK signaling pathway was required for CREB activation. Nonetheless, we also demonstrated that EV71 induced the activation of Akt by using inhibitors of PI\u20103K (LY294002) or AG1478. In addition, pretreatment with LY294002 or transfection with Akt siRNA significantly attenuated the activation of Akt and COX\u20102 expression following EV71 infection in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells. However, pretreatment with LY294002 had no significant effect on EV71\u2010stimulated CREB phosphorylation (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression was dependent on CREB mediated through c\u2010Src/EGFR/p42/p44 MAPK, but not c\u2010Src/EGFR/Akt in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells.",

In this study, we demonstrated that EV71 replication in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells was increased by treatment with PGE2 or forskolin, which was significantly inhibited by treatment with H89 (Fig. 6A). Our data indicated that PGE2 might be essential for the replication of EV71 through cAMP signaling in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells, consistent with previous studies which report that increase of cAMP by PGE2 promotes viral replication [Dumais et al., 1998; Pyeon et al., 2000; Moriuchi et al., 2001]. Moreover, we established that the effect of PGE2 on EV71 replication was mediated through both EP2 and EP4 receptors, since pretreatment with either AH6809 or GW627368x inhibited PGE2\u2010induced viral replication (Fig. 6B). In this case, it is possible that the formation of cAMP following EV71 infection was lower than following direct PGE2 stimulation, and that the level of EV71\u2010induced cAMP was insufficient for viral replication.",

As depicted in Figure 7, EV71 stimulates the activation of EGFR through c\u2010Src and leads to phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK. The MAPK p42/p44 in turn promotes the activation of CREB. Furthermore, CREB associates with p300 and the resulting complex is recruited to the COX\u20102 promoter region to activate COX\u20102 promoter activity, mRNA accumulation, and protein expression. In summary, our findings suggested that EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression may be mediated through c\u2010Src/EGFR/p42/p44 MAPK/CREB signaling in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells. Based on our earlier findings [Tung et al., 2010], EV71 was shown to induce the expression of COX\u20102 and the production of PGE2 in SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells through the concerted action of c\u2010Src, EGFR, MAPKs, NF\u2010\u03baB, AP\u20101, and CREB. The production of PGE2 following EV71 infection further promoted viral replication through EP2/EP4 receptors\u2010cAMP signaling. Therefore, pharmacological approaches which target COX\u20102 and its upstream signaling components may provide useful strategies to limit the deleterious effects of CNS inflammation during viral infection.",
