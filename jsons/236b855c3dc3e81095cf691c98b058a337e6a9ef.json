During an average follow-up period of 11.5 months, a more than 25% improvement was noted in 14 of 19 patients. All those with purelyfocaldystonia and 9 of 10 patientswitha disease history of less than three years benefited from treatment, Side effects were insignificant and transient. Botulinum toxin is a very effective and safe method of treatment for spasmodic torticollis, (Med J Aust 1990; 152: 528-530) T he term \"dystonia\" was coined by Oppenheim in 1911 1 in describing six patients with alterations in muscle tone, sustained posturing and involuntary movements. Since then the definition of dystonia has undergone many modifications, and is now described as \"a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions, frequently causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures\" .2 Dystonia is classified according to age of onset, aetiology (symptomatic or idiopathic) and distribution. Thus, there are focal, segmental and generalized dystonias. Where a single area is involved, such as the eye (blepharospasm), face (oromandibular dystonia), neck (torticollis), or vocal cords (spasmodic dysphonia) the condition is called focal dystonia.\" The commonest form of focal dystonia is spasmodic torticollis (ST) with a suggested prevalence of three per 10 000. 3 When two or more contiguous parts are involved in the disease process, such as the face and the neck, for example, it is called segmental dystonia, and generalized dystonia when one or both legs and the trunk are affected. Hemidystonia involving half the body usually indicates symptomatic dystonia, with abnormality in the basal ganglia.",

            "text": "Spasmodic torticollis was first described by Francois Rabelais, the French humanist, author and physician, in the 16th century. The mean age of presentation is 40 to 50 years, and the female to male ratio is 3:2. 4 Various combinations of neck posture may occur, such as laterocollis, retrocollis and antecollis. The head may be tilted onto one shoulder, and one of the shoulders may be elevated and displaced anteriorly. Intermittent or continuous tremor or spasmodic movement may occur. The severity of the abnormal postures and movements can be aggravated by stress and an activity such as walking, while improvement may be achieved by the patient touching the chin, face or the back of the head. This is the so-called geste antagonistique, quite characteristic of ST but lacking an adequate explanation at the present time, The involuntary movements cease during sleep. Pain can be very severe, intractable and disabling. The onset may be sudden or gradual, the condition usually progressing for a few years and then becoming stationary. Remissions occur in 15% of patients, usually in the first few years after the onset. Many patients are unable to work, and even such activities as driving a car, eating, reading or watching television may become difficult or impossible. The obvious neck deformity causes a constant embarrassment, and the patient's suffering is increased by the lack of understanding and the ineffective therapies available. Medical treatment and psychotherapy are usually unsuccessful. 5-7 Surgical treatment may have adverse results,\" a significant morbidity and even a small mortality\" Botulinum-A toxin, a neuroparalytic agent, has recently been used in the treatment of focal dystonias. It was pioneered for the treatment of strabismus by Dr Alan Scott'? and has been shown to be effective for the treatment of blepharospasm, 11-14 oromandibular dystonias, IS spasmodic torticollis.v?? spasmodic dysphonia\" and focal hand dystonias.:\" Clostridium botulinum produces eight distinct neurotoxins, which cause widespread muscular paralysis, characteristic of the often fatal syndrome of botulism. When botulinum-A toxin is injected intramuscularly in minute quantities local denervation and muscle weakness occur, lasting for several weeks until the nerve endings regenerate. The toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine, probably by interfering with calcium channels.\"",

Objective measurements mirrored these subjective reports. Understandably, patients with focal dystonia responded best of all, and those with generalized dystonia had the least satisfactory results: nine of 10 patients with focal dystonia improved, while two of five individuals with generalized dystonia benefited from the treatment. Men responded less well than women. One of the reasons for this difference may be that the relativelylarger and stronger muscles of men require higher doses of botulinum toxin to produce a paralysis equivalent to that in women. We now attempt to adjust dosages according to body weight and muscle bulk. In 10 patients the duration of the symptoms was less than three years. Nine of these patients improved.
