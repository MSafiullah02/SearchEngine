Managing these emergencies and the threats they pose is part of the long-term government development plans in many countries, and expensive resources are being invested into preventing and responding to public health emergencies.1 In China, surge capacity is one of the most urgent problems regarding public health emergency response at the present time,2 along with the lack of equipment and the low efficiency of the public health emergency information system. Recognizing this, the Chinese Government carried out a series of emergency preparedness education and training programmes to improve the capability of public health staff to respond to emergencies nationwide. However, it remains unclear if these training programmes are feasible and effective in improving emergency preparedness.",

The analysis was limited to staff who were primarily engaged in disease monitoring and control, and epidemiological investigations in the CDC. In addition, evaluations were based on changes over time without the use of a horizontal comparison group. Thus, it was not possible to fully determine which changes were due to the emergency preparedness training programme and which were the result of other factors. These results, however, remained constant throughout, which provides support that these changes were due to the training programme.",

Immediate feedback with results analysis of the continuous monitoring and evaluation should be available to those involved so that necessary improvements can be made. The results of the evaluation suggested that the emergency training strategy was effective and feasible in improving the capability of public health staff to respond to an emergency.",
