RVAs are icosahedral, non-enveloped viruses and belong to the family Reoviridae. The rotavirus genome consists of 11 segments encoding six structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6 and VP7) and six nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP6) (Estes and Kapikian, 2007). RVAs are classified into multiple G and P types defined by the two outer capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4, respectively. To date, 27G and 35P genotypes have been determined, many of which have been identified in the last five years (Matthijnssens et al., 2011). The Rotavirus Classification Working Group proposed a new classification system using nucleotide sequences of all of the 11 genomic RNA segments, Gx-P[x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx representing VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5, respectively (Matthijnssens et al., 2011).",

Subsequently, three more lactating cows neighboring the two infected cows, started showing similar symptoms, and within a week, all adult cows on the farm were affected. The diarrhea feces were liquid and greenish yellow, but not bloody. All animals recovered within a week; however, a decrease in milk production on the farm was observed the day after the first finding of diarrhea and continued for two weeks. Preliminary diagnosis using Dipstick \u2018Eiken\u2019 Rota for RVA revealed that all fecal samples from five cows with diarrhea were positive. All fecal samples in the acute-phase were negative for BCV, BToV, RBV, RCV and BVDV by RT-PCR, and Salmonella species, E. coli K99, Coccidium species and Cryptosporidium species by standard techniques. Examination of paired sera from affected cows revealed no significant increase in antibody titers to BCV, BAV7 and BVDV-1 and 2.",

First, convenient genotyping of RVA was carried out using the CLC Genomics Workbench. Mapping sequence reads from five samples to VP4 and VP7 reference sequences of representative strains (Minami-Fukuda et al., 2013) revealed poor alignment with G6, G8, G10, P[1], P[5] and P[11] \u2013 the most common bovine genotypes. Near complete sequences of the 11 segments of RVA could be obtained from the resultant contigs generated by reads assembled from five samples. The sequences of all 11 segments of RVA were detected from all five samples and confirmed to be identical. The genotypes for each of gene segments of this strain (RVA/Cow-wt/JPN/Tottori-SG/2013/G15P[14] (Tottori-SG)) were determined using the online RotaC genotyping tool (Maes et al., 2009). A very rare G/P combination, G15P[14] was found. Applying the nucleotide-sequence-based complete genome classification system, the constellation of Tottori-SG was determined as G15-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M3-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 representing VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5, respectively.

Nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) of Tottori-SG showed 87.9\u201389.9% and 91.7\u201392.9% sequence identity to other G15 strains at nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) levels, respectively. The VP4 gene of Tottori-SG formed a cluster with RVA/Cow-tc/JPN/Sun9/2000/G8P[14] (Fukai et al., 2004) and RVA/Human-tc/THA/Mc35/XXXX/G10P[14] (Urasawa et al., 1993) (Fig. 1B). Tottori-SG had the highest level of nt and aa identity to strain Sun9 (95.8%, 97.2%) and Mc35 (89.7%, 95.6%), respectively. With regard to the VP6 gene segment, Tottori-SG clustered with the unusual Japanese bovine RVA strains G21P[29] and G24P[33], RVA/Cow-wt/JPN/AzuK-1/2006/G21P[29] (Abe et al., 2009) and RVA/Cow-wt/Dai-10/2008/G24P[33] (Abe et al., 2011), and Simian G3P[2] RVA strains (Mlera et al., 2013). The VP6 gene of Tottori-SG exhibited high nucleotide identity with AzuK-1, Dai-10 and RVA/Simian-tc/ZAF/SA11-N5/1958/G3P[2] (96.0, 96.6 and 95.2%), respectively (Fig. 1C). Phylogenetic analysis of VP1, VP2, VP3, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4 and NSP5 showed that Tottori-SG clustered with genes of bovine or bovine-like rotavirus (Fig. 1D\u2013F, H\u2013K). Similarly, NSP1, which clustered with simian G8P[1] and human G6P[14] strains, was thought to be the result of transmission from ruminant hosts (Matthijnssens et al., 2009, Matthijnssens et al., 2010) (Fig. 1G). Overall, the nucleotide sequences of the 11 genome segments of Tottori-SG had relatively high nucleotide identities to bovine or bovine-like RVA strains (Table 1). Furthermore, apart from the VP7 gene, the gene segments of Tottori-SG were highly homologous with those of Japanese bovine RVA strains (Table 2).",

            "text": "In Japan, G6 and G10 genotypes are predominantly distributed (Ishizaki et al., 1996), and G15 genotype has never been isolated. G15 genotype is very rare in nature. To date, only five RVA strains possessing this genotype are available in database. These including three Indian G15P[21] strains \u2013 Hg18, RUBV51 and RUBV117 \u2013 isolated in 1999 and 2005 (Ghosh et al., 2008, Rao et al., 2000), and two G15P[11] strains \u2013 B383 and RUBV051 \u2013 isolated from Argentina and India in 1998 and 2001, respectively (Ghosh et al., 2008, Matthijnssens et al., 2009). Tottori-SG is the sixth G15 strain and the first report of a G15P[14] combination strain worldwide. All G15 strains were isolated from cattle. VP7 of Tottori-SG demonstrated modest nucleotide identity with other G15 strains, suggesting that VP7 of Tottori-SG is novel and might have an independent ancestor. On the other hand, P[14] genotype has been found in rabbits (Ciarlet et al., 1997), humans (Cowley et al., 2013, Gerna et al., 1994, Matthijnssens et al., 2006, Matthijnssens et al., 2009, Mphahlele et al., 1999, Urasawa et al., 1993), goats, antelope (Ghosh et al., 2007), sheep (Ciarlet et al., 2008), guanacos (Parre\u00f1o et al., 2004) and cattle (Chitambar et al., 2011, Fukai et al., 2004). A recent study suggested that the human P[14] strains were related to RVA strains isolated from even-toed ungulates belonging to the mammalian order Artiodactyla (Matthijnssens et al., 2009). The P[14] VP8* protein has a high affinity to type A human histo-blood group antigens (Hu et al., 2012, Liu et al., 2012). The VP8* of P[14] also binds the A type antigen of bovine and porcine, which could be a reason that P[14] RVAs infect both bovine and human (Liu et al., 2012). In Japan, only one strain, Sun9, has been reported from calves (Fukai et al., 2004). However, the P[14] genotype has never been isolated from other species within Japan, including humans. Tottori-SG shared high nucleotide identity with VP4 gene of Sun9. Although Sun9 remains the only P[14] strain to have been isolated in Japan, it is of interest to examine whether the P[14] strains may be prevalent among Japanese cattle. Further analyses of genes other than VP7 and VP4 revealed that structural and nonstructural protein genes of Tottori-SG showed high identity with those of bovine or bovine-like RVA strains, suggesting Tottori-SG strain might adapt to cattle (Table 1). Furthermore, Tottori-SG shared a similar genetic background with Japanese bovine RVAs (Table 2). Interestingly, VP6 of Tottori-SG was closely related to unusual Japanese RVA strains, Dai-10 (G24P[33]) and AzuK-1 (G21P[29]), together with the Indian strain RUBV51 (G15P[21]), as well as Simian RVA strains. In regard to the NSP2 and NSP3 gene, Tottori-SG clustered with Dai-10 and P[14] guanaco RVA strain in NSP2, and with P[14] guanaco one in NSP3, suggesting relationship between Japanese bovine RVA and this guanaco strain. These data suggest that Tottori-SG might have derived from multiple reassortment events among RVA strains circulating among Japanese cattle.",

However, symptomatic infections of RVA in adult cattle are rare. In the present case, considering both the absence of viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens of diarrhea in the acute-phase fecal samples, and the detection of RVA antigen only during the acute-phase of diarrhea but not after recovery, it is suggested that Tottori-SG associated with the epizootic outbreak of diarrhea in adult cows. At least three cases of symptomatic RVA infection in adult cattle have been reported in Japan (Fukai et al., 2007, Onuma et al., 2003, Sato et al., 1997). In two out of three cases, two rare G and P genotype strains of RVA, BRV16, which belongs to G8P[1]genotype, and Tak2, which probably belongs to G21P[29] genotype, were isolated from fecal samples in adult cows with diarrhea (Fukai et al., 2007, Sato et al., 1997). One of the possible factors responsible for symptomatic infections by RVA in adult cattle is a lack of immunity in cattle against such rare genotype RVAs. The G15P[14] strain may efficiently transmit from infected cattle to immune-na\u00efve ones, causing unusual age pattern of RVA infection. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for epizootic diarrhea of adult cattle caused by rare RVA genotypes, further serological and pathogenic studies are needed.",

This feature provides the opportunity of bioinformatically detecting any other known RNA virus at the same time (Batty et al., 2013). We could not only generate near whole genome sequences of RVA, but could also give the opportunity of bioinformatically detecting any other known RNA virus at the same time. The resultant contigs generated by reads assembly were investigated using BLAST search. However no other RNA virus genome of cattle pathogen was detected within the sequencing reads, suggesting that epizootic diarrhea of adult cows caused by RVA.",
