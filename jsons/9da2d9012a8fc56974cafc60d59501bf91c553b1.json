Observations so far suggest a mean incubation period of five days [7] and a median incubation period of 3 days (range: 0-24 days) [8] . The proportion of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of infection has not yet been definitely assessed. In symptomatic patients, the clinical manifestations of the disease usually start after less than a week, consisting of fever, cough, nasal congestion, fatigue and other signs of upper respiratory tract infections. The infection can progress to severe disease with dyspnoea and severe chest symptoms corresponding to pneumonia in approximately 75% of patients, as seen by computed tomography on admission [8] . Pneumonia mostly occurs in the second or third week of a symptomatic infection. Prominent signs of viral pneumonia include decreased oxygen saturation, blood gas deviations, changes visible through chest X-rays and other imaging techniques, with ground glass abnormalities, patchy consolidation, alveolar *Both authors contributed equally.

Artificial intelligence predicts that drugs associated with AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) disrupting these proteins may inhibit viral entry into the target cells [13] . Baricitinib, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is an AAK1 and Janus kinase inhibitor and suggested for controlling viral replication [13] . Moreover, one in vitro and a clinical study indicate that remdesivir, an adenosine analogue that acts as a viral protein inhibitor, has improved the condition in one patient [14, 15] . Chloroquine, by increasing the endosomal pH required for virus-cell fusion, has the potential of blocking viral infection [15] and was shown to affect activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which is involved in replication of HCoV-229E [16] . A combination of the antiretroviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir significantly improved the clinical condition of SARS-CoV patients [17] and might be an option in COVID-19 infections. Further possibilities include leronlimab, a humanised monoclonal antibody (CCR5 antagonist), and galidesivir, a nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitor, both of which have shown survival benefits in several deadly virus infections and are being considered as potential treatment candidates [18] . Repurposing these available drugs for immediate use in treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infections could improve the currently available clinical management. Clinical trials presently registered at Clini-calTrials.gov focus on the efficacy of remdesivir, immunoglobulins, arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomisation, ASC09F+Oseltamivir, ritonavir plus oseltamivir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, mesenchymal stem cell treatment, darunavir plus cobicistat, hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone and washed microbiota transplantation [19] .",
