The incubation period of 5 to 10 days is followed by a sudden onset marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Approximately the fifth day after the onset of the symptoms, a maculopapular rash may manifest, after which the individual may experience nausea, vomiting, chest pain, sore throat, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea. Patients often develop severe hemorrhagic manifestations between days 5 and 7, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple sites. Symptoms become increasingly severe and can include jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging, and multiorgan dysfunction. The fatality rates have ranged from 25 to 80 percent, with higher rates occurring in outbreaks lacking effective case management.6, 15 In the case of the outbreak in Angola, WHO has reported a greater than 90 percent case fatality rate, rendering this outbreak the deadliest on record for this rare disease: the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1998 to 2000 had a case fatality rate of 83 percent.21\n",

Although the number of antibody-positive survey participants was small, these investigators were able to systematically identify and quantify several risk factors. The local mines were found to be a probable site of primary infection with the virus, most likely through exposure to the primary zoonotic reservoir; this conclusion was based on the preponderance of antibody in male miners without obvious evidence of person-to-person transmission, as well as other factors. Close contact with case patients with the disease or corpses was identified as a risk factor for secondary transmission of Marburg virus.
