BCV causes respiratory and enteric diseases in cattle (Cho et al. 2000; Niskanen et al. 2002). The enteric BCV attacks intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in diarrhea and in economic losses due to reduction in production of milk and lost weight (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al. 2001). A high rate of BCV isolation from nasal specimens of feedlot cattle with signs of respiratory tract disease has also been reported (Lin et al. 2000).",

The terminally differentiated cells of the epithelium are removed by a process of apoptosis occurring throughout the villus. Thus, the renewal process of the intestinal epithelium occurs along the crypt\u2013villus axis (Hall et al. 1994). It has been reported that propagation of some viruses that cause enteropathy depends on the stage of differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells (Jarvis et al. 1999; Ciarlet et al. 2001). However, it is still unclear whether BCV propagation depends on the stage of differentiation of the intestinal epithelium.",

They express disaccharidases, peptidases and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) found in cells of the small intestinal villi in vivo, and they form domes on impermeable substrates, transport ions and water, develop tight junctions that prevent the passage of macromolecules through underlying permeable membranes, and develop transepithelial electrical resistance typical of the polarized epithelium in in vitro cultivations (Eaton & Simons 1995). Thus, Caco\u20102 cells may be suitable for study of BCV propagation in the intestinal epithelia.",

ALP activities of brush\u2010border membranes obtained from 18 clones of 10 days post\u2010confluence were determined, and the two clones showing the highest and lowest levels of ALP activity were selected and named Caco\u20102/CA1 and Caco\u20102/CA2, respectively. A comparison of ALP activities in parental Caco\u20102, CA1 and CA2 cells showed that the activity levels of parental Caco\u20102 and CA1 cells in the brush\u2010border membrane\u2010rich fraction were markedly higher than those of CA2 cells over a period of 15 days post\u2010confluence (Fig. 2a). However, the level of cell proliferation activity of CA2 cells in the exponential growth phase was significantly higher than the levels of parental Caco\u20102 and CA1 cells (Fig. 2b). The results suggest that both parental Caco\u20102 and CA1 cells were in a more differentiated state than were CA2 cells.",

When CA1 and CA2 cells were infected with BCV at confluence, the intervals were 4 days postinfection for CA1 cells and 7 days postinfection for CA2 cells (Fig. 3a,b). Also, when CA1 and CA2 cells were infected at 3 days post\u2010confluence, the virus was detected at 1 and 5 days postinfection, respectively (Fig. 3c,d). Interestingly, virus in the supernatant of both CA1 and CA2 cells was detected immediately after infection when both cells were infected with BCV at 10 days post\u2010confluence (Fig. 3e,f). The results suggest that certain cellular factors that are expressed around 3 days post\u2010confluence in CA1 cells and around 7 days post\u2010confluence in CA2 cells control BCV propagation.",

Interestingly, Caco\u20102 cells have been shown to have high susceptibility to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV). In the case of SARS\u2010CoV, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 has been identified as a receptor (Li et al. 2003) and has been found to be the determinant of host cell restriction (Mossel et al. 2005). Although further studies are needed, it is possible that expression of cellular factors, including the BCV receptor, is responsible for BCV propagation in CA1 and CA2 cells. Thus, CA1 and CA2 cells showing different levels of ALP activity should be good cells for studying the BCV propagation mechanisms.",
