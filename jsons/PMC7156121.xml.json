There is no ciliated tissue in this area, and the virus cannot be removed. Therefore, the subpleural area is the most easily colonised area. The basic lesion of viral pneumonia is interstitial pneumonia.10 Virus invasion into the body initially causes alveolar septal capillaries to dilate and congest, and a small amount of fluid is seen in the alveolar cavity. The lesion is centred on the secondary lung lobules with lobular septal oedema. As the virus multiplies in the body, the alveolar interstitial phase of pneumonia occurs caused by further expansion of the blood vessels and increasing exudate in the alveolar cavity, cellulose exudation is seen in the lungs, and the lesion area increases. During the dissipative period, there is reduction in the oedema of the alveolar capillaries and lobular septum, alveolar exudation and absorption, the remaining lobular septum is thickened, and the bronchial wall is thickened or appears twisted into a cord.",

CT has shown that the extent of the lesion is enlarged and patchy; this is unlike some SARS lesions, which are migratory,18 NCP is enlarged in the original lesions or new lesions occur elsewhere. At the same time, in this study, the lobular interval of the lesion area was thickened, and the HRCT showed a \u201cgrid-like\u201d (Fig 2) or a \u201cpaving stone-like\u201d change. This is because the degree of pulmonary interstitial lesions was greater than that of alveolar parenchymal lesions, and the extent of lesions on the mediastinal window was smaller than that of lesions on the lung window. Exudation was obvious in some areas, and the lungs showed patchy consolidation and increased density. Pulmonary blood vessels and lesions could not be distinguished, but the \u201cair bronchus sign\u201d remained visible. From the lesion to the interlobular fissure, the spread across the lung lobe ceased, and clear interlobular fissures were visible, because the interlobular pleura prevented the spread of inflammation. Strand shadows were visible in the lungs when exudation was distributed along the bronchioles based on gravity. In severe cases, large ground glass or consolidation shadows can be seen in both lungs, showing \u201cwhite-lung-like\u201d changes.",

At this stage, the lesions show a reduction in the scope of the lesion, a decrease in the density of ground glass or consolidation, and a decrease in CT attenuation. Hsieh et al.\n20 suggested that SARS lesions in the lungs may vary depending on the patient's physique, treatment, and condition. Some patients absorbed lesions within 3 months, and long-term, patients still had a shadow within 1 year. The CT manifestations of the recovery period are related to the extent of the lesions. In patients with minor lesions, these can be clearly absorbed within 2 weeks. Residual patchy consolidation, thickened leaflet intervals, or twisted and thick bronchioles can be seen in moderately affected patients, suggesting the recovery of interstitial changes, which takes time. After 1 year of follow-up of severe patients, subpleural cord shadows can still be seen in the lungs, which are considered fibrotic lesions.",

This may be a characteristic manifestation of NCP, but it may also be related to the small number of cases or the stage of the disease. It is worth mentioning that in the present cohort, five patients had positive lung lesions, but the nucleic acid test was negative at that time. Patients are generally in good condition. Another patient had bacterial infection of the lung and a large patch of consolidation was seen in the lung, which was different from typical viral pneumonia.
