Four viral surface glycoproteins (gB, gD, gH and gL) are required. This review summarises the known structure and function of each of these essential viral envelope glycoproteins, and explores what is known about their close cooperation with each other in mediating cellular membrane fusion. It is suggested that, following gD binding to one of its entry receptors, membrane fusion is mediated by gB and the heterodimer gH/gL. Significantly, these four entry glycoproteins also play a key role in the interaction between HSV and the host immune system. The glycoproteins serve an important role as targets of adaptive immunity. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the same proteins also play a key role in initiating the early innate immune response to HSV. Understanding the complex functions of these HSV proteins may be essential for successful development of vaccines for HSV.",

Recent reports have suggested, however, that at least three diverse pathways are implicated in HSV-1 entry into different cell types that are susceptible to infection: via direct fusion with the plasma membrane, via fusion within an acidic endosome, and via fusion within a neutral endosome. Fusion at the plasma membrane is known to occur in Vero cells in a pH-independent fashion [2] . In most cell types virions entry is by endocytosis, but this is also variable. For example, in HeLa cells, primary human keratinocytes and CHO-K1 cells transfected with a gD-receptor, fusion with endosomal membrane requires a low pH environment [3, 4] . In contrast virus entry in mouse melanoma B78H1 cells, expressing a human gD receptor, also involves virion endocytosis, but fusion does not require low pH [5] . Furthermore, this virus internalisation in B78H1 melanoma cells is completely dependent upon the expression of the gD receptor. In each of these pathways, fusion requires gD, gB, gHgL and a gD receptor [6] . It is still unclear however, whether these glycoproteins act in the same way, or form a similar fusion complex, or whether other cellular components are involved in these different entry pathways.",

            "text": "The initial step in HSV-1 entry into mammalian cells is the attachment of the virus to the cell surface. gC and gB interact independently with heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans to promote the initial attachment [9] [10] [11] . Yet these glycoprotein-HS interactions, although important, are not absolutely essential for viral entry, at least not in the infection of cultured cells. A virus mutant at the gB polylysine sequence responsible for the gB-HS interaction is still infectious, although virus binding is reduced; a virus lacking the gC glycoprotein is also still infectious [10, 11] . If both gB and gC are absent, virus binding to cell surface is Figure 1 . Model for direct HSV-1 entry by fusion with the cellular membrane. Initially, although not mandatory (a), gB (together with gC) binds with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (b) or an unknown gB receptor, independent of HS (c) allowing virus-cell attachment. This is followed by gD binding to a cell surface receptor: HVEM, nectin-1 or 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate (d). gD undergoes conformational changes and transmits a signal gB and/or gH-gL. gB possibly interacts with an unknown cell surface component. gB and gH-gL form the fusion machinery that interact with the cellular membrane (e). gB and gH-gL mediate cell fusion and entry of the viral capsid (f). How gB, gH and gL work together to achieve fusion is unclear and steps 3 and 4 are drawn hypothetically severely reduced [10] . Infectivity is completely abolished in such virions, but this could be due to gB's critical role in membrane fusion, rather than to virion attachment at the cell surface. Recent data suggest however, that another receptor, independent of HS, may mediate interaction of gB with the cell surface, since a soluble form of gB was shown to interact with the surface of different cell types independent of HS [12] . The exact nature of this non-HS gB receptor is still unknown, and its role in attachment and/or fusion remains to be determined.",

The protein's ectodomain core is of a V-like domain of the immunoglobulin fold (residues 56-184) [22] . Within the N-terminal extension to the core, a 37 residue hairpin structure (bending at residue 21) forms the entire site which contacts the receptor-HVEM [22, 23] . In the absence of HVEM, the N-terminus adopts an extended and flexible conformation. Since the nectin-1 receptor binds to a different area and does not require the N-terminal hairpin of gD, it has been suggested that it interacts with gD when the N-terminus is in its extended unbent conformation [22, 24] .",

Similar to the N-terminal extension, the C-terminal is flexible, and this flexibility is necessary for correct gD function [25] . The C-terminus of the gD ectodomain, past residue 260, does not participate in a direct interaction with either receptor [24, 26] , but rather wraps around the gD core and blocks the formation of the HVEM binding hairpin, at the same time concealing the residues involved in nectin-1 binding [24, 27] . Mutagenesis of gD at the C-terminus has shown that residue 294 (Trp294) is the necessary anchor in bringing the C-terminus in close proximity to the N-terminus, hence interfering with receptor binding [25] . The structure of gD in its pre-receptor binding form suggests, that in order for the receptors to bind, the C-terminus must move. Furthermore, the movement of the C-terminus upon binding of a receptor is important for the function of gD in activating the mechanism leading to membrane fusion [25] .",

In the absence of gB, gH or gL, HSV cannot enter target cells [25, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Since gD does not have the characteristics of a fusion protein, it is assumed that the central fusion machinery involves gB and the heterodimer gH/gL. In many viruses the fusion process is preformed by specific proteins in the viral membrane. To date, two completely unrelated structural classes have been identified, designated type I and type II fusion proteins. In the type I model (identified in orthomyxoviruses [33, 34] , paramyxoviruses [35] , retroviruses [36] , filoviruses [37] and coronaviruses [38] ), the fusion proteins form homotrimers that are cleaved proteolytically into a surface (SU) subunit and a transmembrane (TM) subunit anchored to the viral membrane. These fusion proteins are extended to a rodlike structure in response to an activating trigger. A hydrophobic -helix fusion peptide at the N-terminus of the TM subunit is exposed and able to penetrate the target cell membrane. A further conformational change in the TM subunit brings together two heptad repeats (HR-1 and HR-2) located downstream of the fusion peptides, to form a coiled coil structure resulting a stable hairpin shaped conformation. This folding back of the fusion protein upon itself brings the viral and cellular membranes into close contact allowing the lipids in the outer membranes to mix [39] [40] [41] . In the type II model (applicable to flaviviruses [42, 43] and alphaviruses [44]), the fusion protein (which bears an internal fusion peptide) is folded flat on the viral surface, in tight association with a second protein as a heterodimer. The activating cleavage occurs in the second protein. Then receptor binding leads to an irreversible rearrangement of the fusion protein into a trimer protruding from the viral envelope. This allows the penetration of the exposed hydrophobic hairpin loop into the target cell membrane [39, 40, 45] . A fold-back movement of the fusion protein then brings the viral and cellular membranes together.",

It appears that these same four surface glycoproteins, as well as acting in viral entry into cells, also play a key role in the immune response to HSV-1, both as well-established targets of effector T-and B-cells, and also (as has been documented in recent studies from our own and other laboratories) in the initial induction of innate immunity and in modulation of dendritic cell (DC) function.",

HSV-1 specific neutralising antibodies were also obtained in response to the gH-gL heterodimer, although their protective efficiency against viral challenge varied considerably in published studies [65, 66] . It is likely that these antigen specific antibody Probably the most important component of the adaptive host immune response is due to CD8 \u00fe cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) responding to specific viral antigens. Various reports showed that gD, gB and to a lesser extent gH serve as a target antigens for CTLs during primary infection [63, [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . There are also HLA-DR CD4 \u00fe T-cells in the HSV-1 lesions that have cytotoxic activity, and these Tcells have been shown to recognise the gB, gH and gD glycoproteins [71] .

An interesting novel approach, thus far also only reported in mice, has been the development of synthetic lipopeptides, where the lipid moiety acts as an adjuvant via the DC, and the gD peptide is the specific antigen to which the T-cell response in induced [85] .

Despite this, as outlined above, the host is usually able to overcome the acute phase of infection by mounting a strong immune response. This is linked to the production of a range of immediate cytokines, which can both precede and control the evolution of the antibody and cytotoxic T-cell responses. Interestingly, at least one phase of this early response of cytokine production is dependent on viral glycoprotein interaction with the cell surface. The very same initial molecular interactions that are required for viral entry appear also to activate cellular signalling pathways responsible for an early burst of type I interferon (ifn) secretion [95] , which may be key to the capacity of the host to overcome infection [96] .",

There is partial DC maturation (as judged by surface phenotype), at the same time there is concomitant impairment of antigen presenting function and eventual apoptosis [92] [93] [94] . The exact pathway by which HSV-1 enters DC has not been characterised, although it likely occurs in a similar fashion to other cell types via the binding of gD to one of two entry receptors: HVEM and nectin-1, followed by gB and/or gHgL mediated membrane fusion. It is interesting that gD binding to HVEM triggers a direct signalling response, leading to NF-B activation [72] , in a similar way to which LIGHT, a known member of the tumour necrosis [97] [98] [99] [100] . In the monoblast-like cell line, U937 this is linked with the apoptotic pathway with inhibition of apoptosis [72] ; in primary cells, this is the process that is thought to lead to the secretion of type I IFN, responsible for the first wave of viral control [94, [101] [102] [103] . Studies have shown that type I IFN released by HSV infected DC, in addition to its anti-viral activity, also acts as a danger signal to bystander uninfected DC, inducing maturation, release of IL-12 and migration of DC cross-presenting antigen [96, 104] . This would promote a more effective Th1 immune response, and provide the link between the immediate and adaptive phases ( Figure 3 ). Thus interaction between viral glycoproteins and the DC surface may be critical for this process to occur [101] .",

Mutation or site deletion of the gH -helix results in HSV's inability to enter cells; its replacement with heterologous fusion peptide of HIV gp41 or of VSV-G partially restores virus infectivity and gH fusion activity[50]. Furthermore, disrupting the HR's capability in forming coiled coils, also affected the ability of gH to function in the infectivity and cell fusion of cultured cells[49,50]. Although gH/gL do not form trimers, these mutagenesis data suggests a function for gH as a fusion protein in viral entry.This being so, gH's function is dependent on forming a heterodimer complex with gL, which acts as a gH chaperone for proper processing and gH trafficking to the viral envelope. HSV-1 gL is a short (224 amino acids) glycoprotein lacking a transmembrane domain [51-53]. Upon expression in a complex with gH, gL is associated with the viral envelope; and, in the absence of gH, gL is secreted from cells [52]. However, HSV-1 virions lacking gL also lack gH, and although they bind to the cell surface, they do not penetrate the cellular membrane[53,54].Like gH, gB is conserved among the Herpesviridae family[48]. HSV-1 gB is a 904-amino acid type I membrane glycoprotein composed of a 696-amino acid ectodomain, a 69-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 109-amino acid carboxyterminal domain. The cytoplasmic domain of gB is the longest among HSV-1 glycoproteins[55]",
