            "text": "Distribution patterns, dispersion processes and permanence of species are some of the most studied topics by ecologists and biogeographers. The distribution of organisms is the basis of ecological studies and can be determined by biotic and abiotic factors (Hutchinson, 1957; Sober\u00f3n, 2007). For example, current patterns of species distributions are linked to historical and contemporary dispersals influenced by species characteristics and their specific functional traits (Baselga, Lobo, Svenning, Arag\u00f3n, & Ara\u00fajo, 2012; Carnaval, Hickerson, Haddad, Rodrigues, & Moritz, 2009; Carnaval & Moritz, 2008; Oberdorff, Hugueny, & Guegan, 1997; Ricklefs, 1987; Silva, Almeida\u2010Neto, & Arena, 2014; Svenning & Skov, 2007). On the other hand, habitat characteristics influence the spatial and temporal distributions of species (Campos, Trindade\u2010Filho, Brito, Llorente, & Sol\u00e9, 2014; Ferreira, Beard, & Crump, 2016; Figueiredo, Storti, Louren\u00e7o\u2010de\u2010Moraes, Shibatta, & Anjos, 2019; Hawkins, 2001). Thus, historical dispersal can be understood using environmental data of the localities at which species have been recorded and the geographical boundaries that restrict them (Gaston, 1991).",

Furthermore, the distribution of a species is often related to species characteristics, such as body size and local abundance (Brown & Maurer, 1989; Gaston, 1990; Lawton, 1993). For example, small ectothermic species can dehydrate faster than large species (MacLean, 1985), and many are prey to vertebrates and invertebrates (Toledo, Ribeiro, & Haddad, 2007; Wells, 2007). Thus, ectotherms rely upon their morphological and physiological adaptations to succeed in surviving and dispersing. In this sense, understanding functional traits (Jim\u00e9nez\u2010Valverde et al., 2015) may be key to understanding the potential distribution of ectotherms (D\u00edaz et al., 2007).",

The sites of high species richness can provide species for sites of low species richness (e.g. Baselga, 2010; Leibold & Mikkelson, 2002; Louren\u00e7o\u2010de\u2010Moraes, Malagoli, et al., 2018; Ulrich & Gotelli, 2007). Geographical distributions of amphibians are strongly affected by type of habit, as terrestrial and aquatic preferences of juveniles and adults, and their ability to disperse across the landscape (Patrick, Harper, Hunter, & Calhoun, 2008). Microclimate characteristics of habitat as forests and open areas can provide physiological and ecological constraints for many species because they influence foraging, reproduction, and survival (Huey, 1991). Such constraints strongly affect the causes and consequences of dispersal abilities as well as the nature of species interactions (McGill, Enquist, Weiher, & Westoby, 2006), including reproductive modes, activity time and antipredator mechanisms (Fahrig, 2001; Ferreira et al., 2019; Monkkonen & Reunanen, 1999). Given that short\u2010term impacts of habitat loss increase and with dispersal ability of amphibians (Homan, Windmiller, & Reed, 2004), there is a critical need to investigate the spatial mismatches between the distribution of species and environmental changes under functional traits approaches (Berg et al., 2010; Cushman, 2006). Forest isolation is a critical factor in biological community structure and fundamentally important in a habitat fragmentation context (Dixo, Metzger, Morgante, & Zamudio, 2009). Understanding beta diversity patterns and evaluating their different compositions (i.e. turnover or nestedness components) along a latitudinal and longitudinal gradient can be an important tool for understanding the dispersal processes of these species (Baselga, 2008, 2010).",

In this context, species typical of open areas can benefit from the alteration of forests due to the increase in their habitat area; and smaller species should be more associated with areas with milder temperatures (e.g. areas of high altitude) due to lower water loss rate to the environment. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that functional traits explain the current pattern of amphibian species composition in the Atlantic Forest. Depending on the functional trait (e.g. body size and ecological specializations) the species may have more ability to disperse and increase its distribution.",

The longitudinal range extends from the coast to 1,000 km inland, and the altitudinal range extends from 0 to 2000 m a.s.l. (Cavarzere & Silveira, 2012). Originally, this biome covered around 150 million ha with a wide range of climatic belts and vegetation formations (Ribeiro, Metzger, Martensen, Ponzoni, & Hirota, 2009; Tabarelli, Pinto, Silva, Hirota, & Bede, 2005). Currently only about 12% of the original biome remains (Ribeiro et al., 2009). This biome occurs across 14 states from the south to the northeast of Brazil (Figure 1). To test the hypothesis that functional traits explain the current pattern of amphibian species composition (see Appendix S1, Figure 1.1) and understand the pattern of beta diversity in each study site, we analysed differences in species compositions (richness and endemism) and mapped out potential dispersal routes. We delimitated the study sites in relation to: (a) geomorphological barriers (see Bittencourt, Dominguez, Martin, Silva, & Medeiros, 2007; Dominguez, Bittencourt, & Martin, 1981); (b) abiotic barriers (Worldclim database; see below); (c) forest composition barriers (see Olson et al., 2001); (d) names based in political divisions; and (e) size of area.",

We used the \u2018Spatial Join\u2019 ArcGIS toolbox to transform species' spatial occurrences in matrices, matching rows from the join features to the target features based on their relative spatial locations. Then, we combined vector files based on expert knowledge of the species' ranges and forest remnant polygons into an overall coverage for species distribution modelling. We only considered spatial occurrences by those species where the distributional data intersected at least a grid cell. We used forest remnant data to meet the habitat patch requirements based on visual interpretation at a scale of 1:50,000, delimiting more than 260,000 forest remnants with a minimum mapping area of 0.3 km2. Therefore, we considered a species present in a cell if its spatial range intersected more than 0.3 km2.

The matrix is decreasing for both columns and rows; columns ranked the areas according to their species richness and rows ranked the species from, the most frequent to the rarest. With this approach, we created and ordered study sites as major biota and its subsets biota. To perform this analysis, original matrices were submitted to 1,000 simulations.

Most Melanophryniscus, Scythrophrys and Lymnomedusa species of the genera occur in group 2. These genera tolerate colder areas of the Atlantic Forest (Frost, 2019). Moreover, the nestedness sites of greatest values were in group 1 and group 2a. This group has sites of warmer forests and more pronounced seasonality due to these species that occur at these points, especially in MS and WPR are mostly species of open areas. In the SMGM site, species that occur at this point are directly related to the Cerrado biome; many species of open areas and forest edges occur at this site.",

The species richness provided by these events reflects direct speciation and specialization with several functional traits, which depending on the specialization, will direct the dispersal of species in a current historical panorama. This process is a cycle that has been repeated for thousands of years, but the current change on the planet by human actions can be directly affected by mass extinction processes (Barnosky et al., 2011; Dirzo et al., 2014).",

            "text": "The current spatial composition and distribution of species are also related to anthropogenic actions and reflects the species most suitable for the new environment, whereas forest and restricted species of the Atlantic Forest are more endemic and endangered. Furthermore, anthropogenic actions can accelerate global warming causing total losses of functional traits (e.g. phytotelmata species, Louren\u00e7o\u2010de\u2010Moraes, Campos, et al., 2019). The strength of this study is its innovative approach to incorporating functional traits into species dispersal assumptions; we need to consider that deforestation has limited most amphibians to small and scattered fragments. In addition, the proximity of the fragments to urban environments affects the permanence of the species in the long term, even the species often found in open area (Louren\u00e7o\u2010de\u2010Moraes, Malagoli, et al., 2018). The maintenance of functional processes as a justification for amphibian conservation actions can be an effective strategy to reduce extinction risk and avoid species loss (Campos, Louren\u00e7o\u2010de\u2010Moraes, Llorente, & Sol\u00e9, 2017). In this context, our research highlights the importance of maintaining forest cover remnants in the Atlantic Forest, and may help to move forward the usefulness of functional traits approaches for other biodiversity hotspots.",
