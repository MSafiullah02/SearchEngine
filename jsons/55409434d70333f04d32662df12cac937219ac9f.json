It stabilizes critical derangements of oxygenation and ventilation, allowing time to diagnose, treat, and recover from the underlying cause of organ failure. This technology was first successfully employed by Hill et al. [1] in 1972, who used it to support an injured patient who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This was quickly followed by successful use of ECMO for cardiogenic shock (1973) and newborn respiratory failure (1975) [2] . Since that time, the technology has matured and been validated as an effective therapy [3] . It is currently used in more than 200 centers around the world to care for over 4,500 neonatal, pediatric, and adult cases per year ( Fig. 10 .1) [4] .",

Oxygen delivery (DO 2 ) is a function of arterial oxygen content (CaO 2 ) and cardiac output (CO) (Eq. 10.1). Arterial oxygen content, measured in mL/min, is dependent upon the hemoglobin concentration (Hgb), its oxygen saturation percentage (SaO 2 ), and the partial pressure of the oxygen dissolved in the plasma (PaO 2 ) (Eq. 10.2). Mathematical review of this equation reveals that oxygen content is largely driven by hemoglobin concentration in contrast to the amount of oxygen dissolved in plasma.",

Double lumen cannulae have been developed (Fig. 10 .2c) that drain from both the superior and inferior vena cava and reinfuse into the right atrium with only a single access site. Cannulation can be performed percutaneously or via cutdown, with percutaneous access being more common. When selecting a drainage cannula for the circuit, the largest appropriate internal diameter should be chosen. This is to maximize flow, which increases by a power of four with increases to the internal radius. In general, 60-80 mL/kg/min of blood flow is needed for 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 supporting for hypoxemia. Central cannulation of the great vessels is performed in some cases when cervical or femoral access is not possible; it also is utilized for patients that have failed to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass [5] . The gas exchange device, also known as the membrane lung or oxygenator, is the core of the circuit. The patient's deoxygenated blood is distributed onto membrane surfaces, on the other side of which sweep gas flows past; the membrane surface allows for gas exchange between the two flows via diffusion. Oxygenation is increased by increasing blood flood through the device. Carbon dioxide clearance, however, is a function of sweep gas flow: increased sweep gas flow rates remove more CO 2 from the blood. Typically 100 % oxygen is chosen as the sweep gas. Increases or decreases in sweep gas rate do not affect oxygenation except at extremely low sweep rates because of the efficiency of the membrane surfaces.",

The roller pump is simple in concept; it creates a positive displacement on the circuit tubing, forcing blood forward. It carries a risk of circuit rupture if there is an occlusion downstream of the pump. The centrifugal pump, in contrast, utilizes an impeller design that is coupled with an electric motor to generate flow in a nonocclusive manner that cannot over-pressurize, but can have heating in the pump head that leads to thrombus formation. An important characteristic of all active circulatory drivers is that excessive negative pressure placed on the drainage catheter increases the risk of endothelial damage or air entrapment. While neither type of pump has been shown to be superior to the other [6] , the smaller, lighter design footprint of centrifugal pumps has helped to facilitate patient transport on ECMO.",

Respiratory support can be considered for hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure, or as a temporary means to bridge-to-lung transplantation.

It can minimize or, in some cases, replace mechanical ventilation while maintaining gas exchange, allowing for \"lung rest.\" Cardiac support is used in acutely decompensated patients, including those with persistent shock despite volume administration, inotropes, and vasoconstrictors, failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass (postcardiotomy), acute myocardial infarction, and acute myocarditis.

These negative results restricted the use of ECMO to a few centers, which continued to find benefit in ECMO support when conventional measures had failed [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Brogan et al. [18] published a summary report from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry, which included 1,473 adult patients who received ECMO for respiratory failure between 1986 and 2006. This series had a median patient age of 34 years, median PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio of 57, and overall survival of 50 %. It was not until 2009, when a third randomized controlled clinical trial, the Conventional Ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR) trial [19] , was published. This study found a survival advantage for patients referred to a specialized center using a treatment protocol that included ECMO compared to those treated at alternate tertiary care centers (63 % survival without severe disability at 6 months versus 47 %). The study has been criticized, as only 75 % of patients randomized to the ECMO group actually received ECMO and because of lack of a control group receiving standardized mechanical ventilation and ICU care [20] .

The median age was 36.5 years, the median PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio was 54.9, and the overall survival was 72.5 %. They matched their patients with patients enrolled in a concurrent Swine Flu Triage study who were not referred for ECMO and found the relative risk of death was 0.45-0.51 in the ECMO-referred patients compared with the non-ECMO-referred patients.

Starting in the 1980s, Gattinoni showed that venovenous ECCO 2 R with minimal ventilator settings resulted in lower mortality in an observational study of ARDS patients [24] . Subsequent work was initially reassuring [25] but a randomized control trial in 1994 revealed no survival advantage to this technique [12] . The incidence of device-related complications was high in this study, with clotting seen in 20 %, resulting in discontinuation of therapy. Improvement in circuits and oxygenator design prompted continued ECCO 2 R study. Bein et al. used a pumpless system in a series of 90 ARDS patients and achieved rapid normalization of carbon dioxide levels, but most patients required vasopressors to support blood minimum flow through the device and 10 % developed lower limb ischemia [26] . A follow-up randomized trial (Xtravent Study) using ECCO 2 R combined with very low tidal volume mechanical ventilation (3 cc/kg) showed improvements in the overall complication rate (8 %) but failed to demonstrate advantage for ECCO 2 R in ventilator free days [27] . The SUPERNOVA (Strategy of UltraProtective lung ventilation with Extracorporeal CO2 removal for New Onset moderate to severe ARDS) study will further investigate the value of ECCO 2 R in ARDS mortality, morbidity, and ability to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury and is planned to start in 2015.",

Some have advocated for extubation of these awake patients [37] . Hemodynamics often improve after beginning ECMO support, allowing the discontinuation of vasopressors. Fluid shifts and blood product consumption may persist for variable periods, thought to be secondary to blood exposure to the nonbiologic extracorporeal circuit [51, 52] .

Oxygenation is primarily proportional to the blood flow rate and the surface area of the membrane lung; it is managed by titrating pump speed. Oximetric measurements from the drainage limb of the circuit may be used as a surrogate for mixed venous saturation and thus provide a measure of the adequacy of oxygenation. In VV ECMO, this measure may be falsely elevated by recirculation (oxygenated blood from the reinfusion cannula crossing directly into the drainage limb rather than entering the right heart). In VA ECMO, oxygenated blood returns retrograde through the aorta so flow dynamics must be monitored closely to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion. The native cardiac circulation may exceed circuit flow, causing only the lower half of the body to be perfused, which is referred to as the Harlequin or North-South syndrome. The retrograde flow may also result in significant venous admixture and lowered arterial oxygen saturations. In these cases, a high hematocrit target has been advocated to maintain oxygen delivery in the face of relative hypoxemia. Ventilation is managed by titrating the sweep gas flow through the membrane lung. CO 2 clearance can be accomplished at lower blood flow rates, permitting the use of lower flow arteriovenous ECMO or extracorporeal CO 2 removal for patients with hypercarbia.",

Investigations in the areas of ARDS, COPD, resuscitation, and inter-facility transport continue. In transplantation, one such approach is extracorporeal support-assisted organ donation after cardiac death. ECMO has been initiated after pronouncement of death to restore perfusion of abdominal organs in hopes of improving organ quality [72] and potentially increasing the number of organs available for transplantation. Additionally, researchers have used ECMO in ex situ perfusion of individual organs. The most progress has been made with pretransplant pulmonary perfusion; human lungs donated for transplant have been supported with a modified ECMO circuit for up to 6 h and then successfully transplanted [73] . Further research will be necessary before this technology becomes routinely incorporated into practice.",

Since it was first described in the 1970s, its use has grown rapidly and more liberal application has been considered. The components of the circuit have greatly matured, making the therapy more reliable and practical to implement. Complications are still common, and thus further advances, particularly in circuit thromboresistance to reduce the need for anticoagulation, will be critical in minimizing the inherent risks of ECMO therapy. Increased use has also spurred further considerations of optimal practice, credentialing, and regionalization of practice. Additional randomized trials are needed to clarify the appropriate indications and best practices for this lifesaving therapy.",
