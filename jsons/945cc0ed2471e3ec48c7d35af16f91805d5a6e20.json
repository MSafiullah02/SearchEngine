It has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions worldwide. Any technological tool that can be provided to healthcare practitioners to save time, effort, and possibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools practitioners currently use to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Computed Tomography (CT), which require significant time, resources and acknowledged experts. X-ray imaging is a common and easily accessible tool that has great potential for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel approach for Covid-19 recognition from chest Xray images. Despite the importance of the problem recent studies in this domain produced not so satisfactory results due to the limited datasets available for training. Recall that Deep Learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large datasets, such data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for Covid-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based classification (collaborative or sparse representation) might provide satisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they generally fall short in performance or speed compared to Machine Learning methods. To address this deficiency, Convolution Support Estimation Network (CSEN) has recently been proposed as a bridge between model-based and Deep Learning approaches by providing a non-iterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally sparse representation coefficient' support, which is critical information for class decision in representation based techniques.",

It has infected more than 3 million people, caused thousands of causalities and has so far paralyzed the mobility all around the World. The spreading rate of Covid-19 is so high that the number of cases is expected to be doubled every three days if the social distancing is not strictly observed to slow this accretion [1] . Roughly around half of Covid-19 positive patients exhibit also a comorbidity [2] , making difficult to differentiate Covid-19 from other lung diseases. Automated and accurate Covid-19 diagnosis is critical for both saving lives and preventing its rapid spread in the community. Currently, RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and CT (computed tomography) are the common diagnosis techniques used today. RT-PCR results are ready at the earliest 24 hours for critical cases and generally take several days to conclude a decision [3] . CT may be an alternative at initial presentation; however, it is expensive and not easily accessible [4] . The most common tool that medical experts use for both diagnostic and monitoring the course of the disease is X-ray imaging. Compared to RT-PCR or CT test, having an X-ray image is an extremely low cost and a fast process, usually taking only few seconds. Recently, WHO reported that even RT-PCR may give false results in Covid-19 cases due to several reasons such as poor quality specimen from the patient, inappropriate processing of the specimen, taking the specimen at an early or late stage of the disease [5] . For this reason, X-ray imaging has a great potential to be an alternative technological tool to be used along with the other tests for an accurate diagnosis.",

However, they use a rather small dataset (the largest containing only a few hundreds of X-ray images), with only a few Covid-19 samples. This makes it difficult to generalize their results in practice. To address this deficiency and provide reliable results, in this study the researchers of Qatar University and Tampere University have compiled the largest Covid-19 dataset, called QaTa-Cov19. Compared to the earlier benchmark dataset created in this domain, such as COVID Chestxray Dataset [10] or Covid-19 DATASET [11] , QaTa-Cov19 has the follow\u0131ng unique benchmarking properties. First, it is the largest dataset, not only in terms of the number of images (more than 6200 images) but its versa-tility i.e., QaTa-Cov-19 contains additional major pneumonia categories, such as Viral and Bacterial, along with the control (normal) class. Moreover, this is the most diverse dataset encapsulating X-ray images from several countries (e.g. Italy, Spain, China, etc.) produced by different X-ray machines. Finally, the images are in different quality, resolution and SNR levels as shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 : Sample Covid-19 X-ray images from QaTa-Cov19.",

Some sample images are shown in Fig. 2-(b) . Another fact which makes the diagnosis far more challenging is that inter-class similarity can be very high for many X-ray images as some samples shown in Fig. 2-(a) . Against such high inter-class similarities and intra-class variations, in this study we aim for a high robustness level. Our primary objective is to achieve the highest sensitivity possible in the diagnosis of Covid-19 induced pneumonia with an acceptable false-alarm rate (e.g. specificity > 95%). In particular, the misdiagnosis of a Covid-19 X-ray image as a normal case should be minimized whilst a small number of false negatives is tolerable.",

            "text": "An alternative supervised approach, which requires a limited number of training samples to achieve satisfactory classification accuracy is representation-based classification [12] , [13] , [14] . In representation-based classification systems, a dictionary, whose columns consist of the training samples that are stacked in such a way that a subset of them corresponding to a class, is pre-defined. A test sample is expected to be a linear combination of all points from the same class as the test sample. Therefore, given a predefined dictionary matrix, D and a test sample y, we expect the solutionx from y = Dx, carry enough information about the class of y. The two well-known representation based classification methodologies are sparse representation-based classification (SRC) [13] and collaborative representation based classification (CRC) [12] . Out of these two, SRC provides slightly improved accuracy by solving a sparse representation problem, i.e., producing a sparse solutionx from y = Dx. Then, the location of the non-zero elements ofx, which is also known as support set, provides us with the class of the query y. Despite improved recognition accuracy, SRC solutions are iterative solutions and can be computational demanding compared to CRC. In a recent work [15] , a compact neural network design that can be considered as a bridge between learning-based and representation-based methodologies was proposed. The socalled Convolutional Support Estimation Network (CSEN) uses a pre-defined dictionary and learns a direct mapping using moderate/low size training set, which maps query samples, y, directly to the support set of representation coefficients, x (as it should be purely sparse in the ideal case).",

Since the largest set of Covid-19 X-ray images ever compiled is used in this study, the proposed approach can be evaluated rigorously against a high-level of diversity to obtain a reliable analysis. The general pipeline of the proposed CSEN based recognition scheme is illustrated in Fig. 3 . In order to obtain highly discriminative features, we use the recently proposed CheXNet [16] , which is the fine-tuned version of 121 layer Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet-121) [17] by using over 100000 frontal view Xray images form 14 classes. Having the pre-trained CheXNet for feature extraction, we develop two different strategies to obtain the classes of query X-ray images: (i) using collaborative representation-based classification with a proper preprocessing; (ii) a slightly modified version of our recently proposed convolution support estimator (CSEN) models. The proposed CSEN scheme outperforms the competing methods and achieves over 98% of sensitivity and over 95% for specificity in this challenging dataset.",

In developing the dictionary, training samples are stacked in D with particular locations in such a way that the optimal support for a given query y should be the set of all points coming from the same class as y. Therefore, a solution vector,x of y = Dx is supposed to have enough information, i.e., the sparse support should be the set of location indices of the training sample from the same class as y. This strategy is generally known as representation-based classification. However, a typical solutionx of y = Dx is not necessarily a sparse one especially when its size grows with more training samples, which results in a highly underdetermined system of linear equations. Fortunately, if one estimates the representation coefficient vector with a sparse recovery design such as 1 -minimization as in Eq. (3), we can expect that the important non-zero entries of the solution, x, are grouped in the particular locations that correspond to the locations of the training samples from the same class as y.

Despite the good recognition accuracy performance of SRC systems, their main drawbacks is the fact that their sparse recovery algorithms (e.g., 1 -minimization) is iterative methods and computationally costly, rendering them infeasible in real time applications. Later, the authors of [12] introduced Collaborative Representation based Classification (CRC), which is similar to SRC except for the use of traditional 2 -minimization in the second step; x = arg min x y \u2212 Dx .

The authors have carried out the task of collecting and indexing the X-ray images for Covid-19 positive cases reported in the published and preprint articles from China, South Korea, USA, Taiwan, Spain, and Italy, as well as online news-portals (up to 20th April 2020). Therefore, these X-ray images represent different age groups, gender, ethnicity and country. Negative Covid19 cases were normal, viral and bacterial pneumonia chest X-ray images and collected from the Kaggle chest Xray database. Kaggle chest X-ray database contains 5863 chest X-ray images of normal, viral and bacterial pneumonia with varying resolutions [40] . Out of these 5863 chest X-ray images, 1583 images are normal images and the remaining are bacterial and viral pneumonia images. Sample X-ray images from QaTa-Cov19 dataset are shown in Fig. 6 .",

However, these techniques usually necessitates a large number of training samples (e.g., several hundred-thousand to millions depending on the network size) to achieve an adequate generalization capability. That is to say, the aforementioned problem of the data scarcity with the Covid-19 case prevents us from training a deep learning technique from scratch. Albeit, we can still leverage their power by finding properly pre-trained models for similar problems. To this end, we use a-state-of-the art pneumonia detection network, CheXNet, whose details are summarized in Section III-A. With the pre-trained model, we extract 1024long vectors, right after the last average pooling layer. After data normalization (zero mean and unit variance), we obtain a feature vector s \u2208 R d=1024 .",

On the other hand, even if the exact signal recovery is not possible in noisy cases or in cases wherex is not exactly but approximately sparse (which is the case in almost all the time in dictionarybased classification problems), it is still possible to recover the support set exactly [9] , [30] , [41] , [42] or partially [42] , [43] , [44] . However, many works in the literature dealing with SE problems tend to first apply a sparse recovery technique on y to first getx, then use simple thresholding overx to obtain a sparse support estimation,\u039b. Nevertheless, SSR techniques such as 1 -minimization are rather slow and their performance varies from one SRR tool to another [15] . In our previous work [15] , we proposed an alternative solution for this handcrafted sparse recovery approach which aims to learn a direct map from test sample y to the support set\u039b. Along with the speed and stability compared to conventional SSR based techniques, and recent deep learning based solutions to SRR problem, CSEN has a crucial advantage of having a compact design that can achieve a good performance level even over scarce training data.",

As can be easily observed from the Table I , the proposed approaches surpass all competing methods in Covid-19 recognition performance by achieving 98.5% sensitivity, and over 95% specificity. As shown in Table III , compared to MLP and ReconNet, the proposed CSEN designs are very compact, and computationally efficient. This is evident in Table IV where the computational complexity (measured as total computation, time over the 1257 test images) is reported. When compared against CRC in particular, CSEN-based classification has two advantages; computational efficiency and, a superior Covid-19 recognition performance. The computational efficiency comes from the fact that a larger size dictionary matrix (of size of 512 \u00d7 8832) is used in CRC and hence, this requires more computations in terms of matrix-vector multiplications. Furthermore, saving the trainable parameters (\u223c 16k) and a light dictionary matrix coefficients (\u223c 1280k) in the test device is more memory efficient compared to saving coefficients (\u223c 4521k) of larger size dictionary used in CRC. For further analysis, we also tested the CRC framework by using the light dictionary (of size 512 \u00d7 2500) used in CSEN based recognition. We called it CRC (light), and as it can be seen in Table V , the performance of CRC further reduced, and there was no significant improvement concerning the computational cost. When it comes to creating deeper convolutional layers instead of using CSEN designs, such as the modified ReconNet, the results presented in Table I shows us that compact CSEN structures are indeed preferable to achieve superior classification performances compared to deeper networks. Finally, Table VI presents the overall (cumulative) confusion matrix of the proposed CSEN-based Covid-19 recognition approach over the new QaTa-Cov19 Dataset. The most critical mis-classifications are the false-positives, that is, the misclassified Covid-19 X-ray images. The confusion matrix shows that the proposed approach has mis-classified 7 Covid-19 images (out of 462). The 3 out of 7 misclassifications are still in \"Viral Pneumonia\" category, which can be an expected confusion due to the viral nature of Covid-19. However, the other four cases are mis-classified as \"Normal\" which is indeed a severe clinical misdiagnosis. A close look to these falsenegatives in Fig. 9 reveals the fact that they are indeed very similar to normal images where typical Covid-19 patterns are hardly visible even by an expert's naked eye. It is possible that these images come from the patients who were in the very early stages of Covid-19.",

            "text": "The commonly used methods in Covid-19 diagnosis, namely Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction and Computed Tomogrophy have certain limitations and drawbacks such as long processing times and unacceptably high misdiagnosis rates. These drawbacks are also shared by most of the recent works in the literature based on deep learning due to the data scarcity from the Covid-19 cases. Although Deep Learning based recognition techniques are dominant in Computer Vision where they achieved state-of-the-art performance, their performance degrades fast due to data scarcity, which is the reality in this problem at hand. This study aims to address such limitations by proposing a robust and highly accurate Covid-19 recognition approach directly from raw X-ray images without any pre-or post-processing. The proposed approach is based on the CSEN that can be seen as a bridge between Deep Learning models and representationbased methods. CSEN uses both a dictionary and a set of training samples to train direct map from the query samples to the sparse support set of representation coefficients. With this unique ability and having the advantage of a compact network, the proposed CSEN-based Covid-19 recognition systems surpass the competing methods and achieve over 98% sensitivity and over 95% specificity. Furthermore, they yield the most computationally efficient scheme in terms of speed and memory. Finally, the largest dataset of X-ray images, QaTa-Cov19 will be released along with this study as a benchmark dataset in this domain. This will, henceforth, accelerate the research efforts globally and support the fight against Covid-19 worldwide.",
