In these settings, physical touching and toileting, crowding and shared rooms, and staff working in multiple settings may further increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. As discussed above, features of moderate to severe dementia such as severe memory impairment, and BPSD such as wandering, and agitation may thwart attempts to promote the actions recommended to reduce risk of transmission. In the other direction, imposition of increased hand hygiene, isolation, or restriction of visitors and activities may worsen cognitive symptoms or BPSD, increasing further care needs and risks.",

Over the past two decades, ADRD has become one of the most active areas of both basic and clinical research, attracting major industry, government, and philanthropic funding in the Western world. As of March 31, 2020, a search on clinicaltrials.gov (as of March 29, 2020) using the key words \u201cdementia\u201d or \u201cAlzheimer's disease\u201d reveals 592 active studies. A recent published study of the same registry identified 156 trials (including 42 phase-3 trials) investigating 132 agents for the treatment of ADRD, and another 33 trials of 15 different devices.35 Abrupt interruption of all these research studies would not only jeopardize a crucial investment society has already made, but it could also have long lasting consequences for the field of ADRD research. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic could be a welcome catalyst to accelerate the adoption of innovative design and methods in clinical research,33 fundamentally changing the way participants in trials for ADRD are recruited and assessed. The rest of this section discusses whether and how ADRD clinical research can continue during the pandemic.",
