First, we had to create ICU shift groups composed of physicians and paramedics coming from different ICUs of eight French military training hospitals. Some paramedics who did not usually work in ICU had to adapt quickly to a new and highly technical environment under challenging conditions, with the help of intensivists and experimented ICU nurses. Then, we had to be flexible and to adapt to face unexpected situations: pharmacy shortages, or unforeseen needs such as mechanical restraints for awakening patients. The access to the CT scanner was uneasy, and we had to plan intrahospital ambulance transports carefully. Ambient temperature was also challenging, because of negative temperatures outside down to -5\u00b0C during the nights and up to 33\u00b0C inside the EMRSSA during the day. However, air conditioning and heating were available. None of the equipment failed in the high or low temperatures, except the portable blood analyser that did not work at temperatures above 30\u00b0C.",
