The compounds in the garlic\nessential oil inhibit the ACE2 protein, leading the virus to lose\nthe host receptor and attacking the PDB6LU7 protein\u2014the main protease of SARS-CoV-2\u2014at\nthe same time. This prevents protein maturation of the virus and the\nspread of infection. Docking simulation suggests the active binding\nsite of most active compounds in garlic essential oil with the ACE2\nprotein and the PDB6LU7 protein. From the analysis of the docking data, it is revealed that\n17 (T1\u2013T17) out of 18 compounds of the garlic\nessential oil are capable of inhibiting ACE2 and resisting SARS-CoV-2\nand that the total content of these 17 compounds accounts for 99.4%\ncomposition of the garlic essential oil. The docking score (DS) energy\nof compounds for the ACE2 protein ranges from \u221214.06 to \u22127.89\nkcal\u00b7mol\u20131, and the DS energy of compounds\nfor the PDB6LU7 protein of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from \u221215.32 to \u221211.68\nkcal\u00b7mol\u20131. The order of active compounds inhibiting\nthe ACE2 protein is as follows: T5 = T11 > T1 = T2 > T4\n> T8\n> T9 > T12 > T13 > T14 > T15 > T3 > T7 > T10\n> T16 > T17 > T6. Meanwhile, the order of active compounds\nresisting SARS-CoV-2 is T2 = T1 > T5 > T4 > T11 >\nT15 > T8 > T16 > T9 > T12 > T13 > T3 >\nT6 > T7 > T10 > T14 > T17. The synergistic interactions\nof\n17 substances of the garlic essential oil exhibited good inhibition\non the ACE2 protein (host receptor of the virus) and the PDB6LU7 protein of the virus.\nThis study opens the door toward the use of the garlic essential oil\nin discovering and treating SARS-CoV-2 to prevent the current pandemic.",
