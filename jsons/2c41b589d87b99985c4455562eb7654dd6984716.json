We conducted a PubMed search, and 166 articles published between 2012 and 2018 on FDA-approved drug products were selected for further review. Qualifying publications were summarized according to therapeutic area, medication(s) studied, pharmacokinetic model type utilized, simulator program used, and the applications of that modeling. The results showed a 13-fold increase in the number of papers published from 2012 to 2018, with the largest proportion of articles dedicated to the areas of infectious diseases, oncology, and neurology, and application extensions including prediction of drug-drug interactions due to metabolism and/or transporter-mediated effects and understanding drug kinetics in special populations. In addition, we profiled several high-impact studies whose results were used to guide package insert information and formulate dose recommendations. These results show that while utilization of PBPK modeling has drastically increased over the past several years, regulatory support, lack of easy-to-use systems for clinicians, and challenges with model validation remain major challenges for the widespread adoption of this practice in institutional and ambulatory settings. However, PBPK modeling will continue to be a useful tool in the future to assess therapeutic drug monitoring and the growing field of personalized medicine.",

This allows providers to effectively communicate known reactions to patients and provide appropriate monitoring. An additional consideration for providers is the medication adverse effects which are provoked by a patient's comorbidities (e.g., renal and hepatic impairment) and interactions with other medications. Drugdrug interactions (DDIs) lead to changes in the pharmacokinetics of treatments, resulting in unintended ADRs, an increase in adverse effects, or reduced efficacy. This is especially important with narrow therapeutic index drugs such as warfarin, lithium, and digoxin, because even minimal changes in drug concentration or metabolism can lead to the drug not being effective or can cause toxic and potentially irreversible adverse effects. Conversely, exploitation of drug interactions may be beneficial in some treatment regimens; for instance, utilization of cobicistat (an enzyme inhibitor) to increase the exposure of atazanavir or darunavir in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) . Although the pharmacist acts as a late gatekeeper for drug efficacy and safety, utilization of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling tools may be helpful to facilitate the decision-making process in all levels of the patient-centered healthcare model.",

PBPK modeling is a mechanistic mathematical modeling technique that integrates drug (substance) and system (physiology) information that is used to predict pharmacokinetic characteristics and disposition for drugs [2, 3] . Differential equations are implemented in a number of commercial software packages (e.g., Simcyp\u00ae Population-Based Simulator, GastroPlus\u00ae, and PK-SIM\u00ae) [4] . PBPK models provide many advantages over static models, which typically use one or two in vitro parameters to predict specific human PK parameters, overall drug exposures, or magnitude of drug-drug interactions (DDI) without considering time-varying changes [5] . In contrast, PBPK models are able to assess complex clinical scenarios, such as potential DDIs due to time-dependent metabolism or transporter changes, pharmacokinetics in special populations with notable physiological differences (e.g., pediatrics, geriatrics, and pregnancy), bioequivalence, food effects, and pharmacogenomics [6] . By incorporating drug-specific and system-specific parameters from different sources, these models are able to estimate PK parameters, further our understanding of a compound's properties, and predict plasma and tissue concentration-time profiles.",

There are many individualized parameters that can alter a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) characteristics, including age, comorbidities, renal and hepatic status, genetic polymorphisms, and more. PBPK modeling is a predictive tool that can be used to influence drug choice, selection, and routes of administration in different ethnic populations as well as populations of various ages and with various disease stages. Some applications of PBPK models include examination of potential drug-drug interactions, pharmacokinetics within special physiological populations (e.g., pediatrics, pregnancy), and other pharmacokinetic differences based on internal (genetic polymorphisms) and external (food effect) characteristics. Through the use of modeling, clinical pharmacists can play a role in the management of complex drug regimens and may be able to avoid drugs with potential adverse effects in susceptible patients.",

The number of articles increased from 1 article published in 2012 to 16 articles published in 2018, representing a 16-fold increase. A likely reason for the increase in articles is due to increased concern about antibiotic resistance and the involvement of anti-infectives in clinically significant drug-drug interactions. According to the World Health Organization, antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today. Resistance to antibiotics has been attributed with the inappropriate use and overuse of antibiotics in humans and animals, and it has resulted in longer hospital stays, higher medical costs, and increased mortality. Drug-drug interactions are of particular clinical importance with antimicrobials, especially in patients who are receiving therapy for HIV. Roberts et al. e x a m i n e d t h e D D I b e t w e e n a n t i r e t r o v i r a l s a n d antituberculotic drugs in patients with HIV coinfected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis [13] . Resistance to antituberculosis drugs can occur when prescribers prescribe the wrong treatment or the wrong dose for an inappropriate length of time. The treatment of tuberculosis is especially critical in patients with HIV because patients are immunocompromised, which increases the mortality rate of infections. One of the common drugs used for tuberculosis in patients with HIV is rifampin, an antibiotic that acts as a strong inducer for many cytochrome P450 enzymes, which in turn can lower the expected concentrations of drugs which are hepatically metabolized. PBPK modeling to assess the DDI risk of antituberculosis drugs like rifampin when co-administered with other medications is incredibly important as resistance may develop with low drug concentrations.",

The number of articles in this area increased from 2 published in 2012 to 14 published in 2018, representing a 7-fold increase. According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that there will be 1,735,350 new cancer cases diagnosed and 609,640 cancer deaths in the USA in 2018. Per the National Cancer Institute, cancer is the second largest cause of mortality within the USA, following behind cardiovascular diseases, and approximately 38.4% of men and women are diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes. New research is constantly being done to create better treatments for a variety of cancer types, and PBPK models have the potential to play a major role in the approval of new drugs. Many oncologic medications have severe adverse effects, so it is unethical to treat healthy subjects in live clinical trials. In this application setting, PBPK modeling has been used to determine adverse effects, dosing strategies, and the potential for drug-drug interactions. In addition, it can be used to determine optimal dosing strategies based on comorbidities and other patient-specific factors. Several notable applications of PBPK modeling profiled here include determination of the dosing of etoposide in adults and children and systemic drug exposure of busulfan in children [7, 14] .",

As such, it was anticipated that this therapeutic area would have one of the highest proportions of articles.

This represents an increase from 1 article published in 2012 to 10 articles published in 2018, a 10-fold increase. Drugs which act on the central nervous system are of great interest in PBPK modeling, as their activity depends on adequate levels of drug within the target tissue (e.g., brain). Because of this, clinicians often rely on surrogate markers of plasma concentration in order to determine a dose- related exposure-response relationship [15] . The blood-brain barrier consists of tight junctions between capillary endothelial cells, which restrict diffusion into the central nervous system, which even once entered can be removed by efflux pumps (e.g., P-glycoprotein or MDR1, and breast cancerresistant protein) [16, 17] . The ability of a drug to penetrate this barrier is essential in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases including epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, drugs indicated for non-neurologic diseases, such as efavirenz (an antiviral) may have enhanced permeability into the CNS and produce serious adverse effects such as neurocognitive impairment. This creates marked importance on the utilization of quantitative approaches like PBPK modeling in order to predict drug disposition in both the plasma and target tissue. Figures 3 and 4 show the majority of articles about model applications pertained to drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction (34%). This was further classified into metabolism (23%), transporter (7%), and combination applications (4%). Assessment of DDI through modeling allows health care providers to examine the interaction potential of medications and interpret their clinical significance without causing patient harm. Other notable applications included pharmacokinetic predictions (26%) and simulations in special populations (30%). Special populations were broken into subgroups including renal impairment, pregnancy, pediatrics, and race/ethnicity. Other model applications representing altogether 9% of articles included cerebrospinal fluid distributions, impact of genetic polymorphisms, bioequivalence, and pharmacokinetic variability. PBPK was the most common model type seen in the literature search (93% of all articles); a drastically fewer percentage of models included a pharmacodynamic component as well (7%). Several articles were found with application extensions that included dose recommendations and patient package insert changes, simulation of challenging clinical scenarios (e.g., impact of a missed dose), and providing guidance for clinical trials which are currently underway, PBPK modeling offers distinct advantages over other types of mechanistically static models (i.e., utilizing one or two in vitro parameters to predict discrete human pharmacokinetics), which rely on steady-state presumptions. PBPK is dynamic in the ability to simultaneously model multiple drug disposition processes [18] [19] [20] . We have highlighted, within applications for each disease state, several mechanisms specific to PBPK modeling that enhance understanding of drug product mechanisms. These include (1) prediction of drug concentrations in specific target tissues, (2) generation of virtual clinical studies to demonstrate variation in outcomes in regard to genetic polymorphisms, (3) drug-disease modeling for high-acuity clinical situations, (4) prospective prediction of drug pharmacokinetics and dosing using in vitro to in vivo extrapolations (IVIVE), and drug absorption, especially for advanced drug delivery systems (i.e., controlled-or extended-release).",

Patients with HIV are often prescribed complex, multidrug regimens which present with a multitude of drug-drug interactions. Without clinical data, DDIs are often predicted based on preclinical data and knowledge of the disposition of individual drugs. Predicting drug interactions can be extremely difficult because some antiretroviral drugs induce and inhibit multiple cytochrome P450 isoenzymes simultaneously. This can present a significant challenge for clinicians, who are tasked with monitoring not only the patient's antiviral regimen but also providing appropriate prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Roberts et al. created a model to examine the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in patients with HIV-infected patients [13] . The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of cobicistat or ritonavir in modulating DDIs between darunavir and rifampin in a human hepatocyte-based in vitro model. Another study sought to predict the magnitude of the DDI between efavirenz, an inducer of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of CYP2C8, and dual CYP3A4/CYP2C8 substrates (repaglinide, montelukast, pioglitazone, paclitaxel) using PBPK modeling [24] . Another study used a PBPK model of the interaction between levonorgestrel and efavirenz in order to develop a dose-adjustment strategy for overcoming this interaction [25] .",

Regarding infectious diseases, a current example of this can be seen with Yao et al. and their development of PBPK models for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to evaluate oral dosing regimens for SARS-CoV-2 infection [26] . A permeability rate limiting model and high lung-to-plasma partition coefficient was used to imitate drug accumulation in lung tissue, the investigated site of action in COVID-19 to reduce potential for cytokine storm by IL-6 and IL-10 which results in multi-organ failure. Several clinical trials are investigating both drugs for use in SARS-CoV-2 infection and as such, the PBPK model provides the groundwork for an optimized dosing regimen for clinical trials due to evaluation of the unique pharmacokinetics (i.e., high accumulation in cells and long elimination halflife) to maximize lung tissue concentrations while minimizing the systemic adverse effect profile. The assessment of target tissue concentrations is an advantage specific to PBPK models as they are equipped to assess anatomic (e.g., volumes and tissue compartment connectivity) and physiologic (e.g., flows and clearance) characteristics of molecular entities while also considering the physicochemical properties of the drug [27] .",

Because agents used to treat cancer target rapidly dividing cells and thus have an unfavorable adverse effect profile, it may be unethical or impractical to treat healthy subjects in clinical trials, which increases the utility of PBPK modeling for this application. The therapeutic classes of oncologic medications investigated included topoisomerase I/II inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, alkylating antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and hedgehog pathway inhibitors. Understanding drug-drug interactions and special populations were the major applications seen with oncologic medications, reflecting the scenarios that clinicians most often encounter in practice. In addition to antineoplastic agents themselves, regimens frequently consist of \"comfort medications,\" including anti-nausea medications, appetite stimulants, etc., which are used to make the patient's chemotherapy regimen more tolerable but can also impact drug metabolism and result in adverse effects. Lastly, cancer patients may have other comorbid conditions or organ damage which can be due to the type of cancer or chronic consequences of the other medications they are taking. Several studies involving oncologic medications focused on interactions mediated through the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymatic network. Narayanan et al. studied CYP3A4 induction by enzalutamide via Simcyp, which is a therapy approved for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and is often dosed as a combination in clinical practice [4] . Einolf et al. examined the interaction between ketoconazole and rifampin with the use of sonidegib, a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma which is also a CYP3A4 substrate. [28] . Studies conducted by Budha et al. and Yamazaki on cobimetinib and crizotinib respectively explored the impact of drug-drug interactions involving CYP3A4 substrates and evaluated the results using Simcyp [29, 30] . In addition, Simcyp was utilized to examine the potential for drug-drug interactions involving renal organic anion transporters (OATs) in patients using pemetrexed [31] .",

In this method, each \"virtual subject\" is assigned a unique set of these properties while maintaining the distribution of genetic polymorphism, ethnic differences, and intra-and inter-individual variability for that population. An example of this is best depicted by Toshimoto et al. and their assessment of irinotecan administered intravenously using VCS to identify factors related to drug-induced adverse effects (e.g., neutropenia and diarrhea) [32] . Correlation between drug exposure and adverse effects of neutropenia and diarrhea was determined through simulated AUC values above a set AUC threshold in plasma and enterocytes, respectively, which were derived from in vivo studies. In this work, 1,000,000 virtual subjects were generated and AUC values of irinotecan and its metabolite (SN-38) were simulated in the context of 6 genetic polymorphisms, including UGT1A1*28 and SLCO1B1 c.521 T > C.

The VCS explores the impact of patient adherence, which is difficult and nearly impossible to assess prospectively in vivo as patients tend to declare their compliance greater than what is reality. The study results support the use of a fixed-dose combination of tamoxifen and endoxifen in CYP2D6 extensive-and intermediate-metabolizers in combination with therapeutic drug monitoring as drug holidays were found to tremendously decrease plasma levels despite the long half-life of tamoxifen.

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (also known as statins) are used to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by modulating levels of cholesterol in the blood. This class of medications is notable for its potential of serious adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity, and myopathy. Statins were the subject of a study by Tsamandouras et al., which predicted the concentration-time profiles of simvastatin in muscle (to assess toxicity) and in the liver (to assess efficacy) [37] . Another class of medications utilized in the literature is the angiotensin-receptor blocking agents (ARBs), which are commonly used for the management of hypertension and heart failure.

Rasool developed a PBPK model that incorporated hepatic and renal hemodynamic changes in patients using carvedilol for chronic heart failure [43] . Vogt developed a PBPK drug-disease model for milrinone in pediatric patients with and without low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) after open heart surgery in order to provide guidance on optimal dosing [44] . Age dependency of milrinone plasma clearance has been described utilizing nonlinear mixed effects modeling (non-MEM), which is not reflected by age-stratified dosing, and further does not consider differences in organ function between patients with and without LCOS. The study incorporated a drug model consisting of drug-dependent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and a system component for whole-body (i.e., multiple organ compartments) application of intravenous dosing. A disease model with pre-, intra-, and post-operative components associated with open heart surgery consisting of influential factors (i.e., LCOS, acute kidney injury, surgical trauma) was used to describe altered pharmacokinetics of milrinone with and without LCOS. These two models were integrated for simulation in a patient population with varied characteristics, such as age, race, sex, and bodyweight, organ growth, and maturation. The study results generated optimized dosing regimens for LCOS treatment and prevention for pediatric patients stratified into 6 age clusters and provide information that adult dose scaling attempts are inadequate. Furthermore, patients with LCOS vs. those without after surgery require lower maintenance infusion doses. This example of a drug-disease model demonstrates the importance that PBPK modeling can have in balancing harm with efficacy in context of clinical situations requiring higher acuity of care.",

Marsousi et al. demonstrated increased understanding of ticagrelor pharmacokinetics utilizing PBPK modeling to assess a clinically relevant drug-drug interaction and need for reduced dosing with ritonavir, an antiretroviral agent commonly utilized in HIV and major CYP3A4 inhibitor [46] . Part of this group's assessment was construction of a PBPK model for ticagrelor using intrinsic clearances obtained from in vitro assessments using human liver microsomes [47] . When applying these in vitro values to their model, oral clearance and the exact contribution of CYP3A4 to hepatic metabolism were not wholly accounted for. As such, these model features were refined and improved based on existing clinical literature using sensitivity analyses. The construction of the ticagrelor model coupled with DDI simulation in this example demonstrates how IVIVE can be used to prospectively assess drug disposition for clinically relevant situations to inform dosing decisions.",

Currently, about 60-70% of newly diagnosed patients have their seizures controlled effectively with AED monotherapy; however, the remaining 30-40% of the patients present with refractory seizures and inevitably need to be treated with AED polytherapy [51, 52] . Polytherapy with two or more AEDs and/or drugs used for other disease states dramatically increases the probability of DDIs and the risk of serious clinical consequences. Our group has developed PBPK models addressing DDIs of the commonly used AEDs, valproic acid, and lamotrigine [53, 54] . These models utilize UGT enzyme kinetics from in vitro literature, which have been scaled to fit the observed clinical data. Commonly encountered DDIs of these agents are evaluated such as UGT induction by concomitant administration of other AEDs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital), as well as the classic UGT inhibition of lamotrigine metabolism by valproic acid.",

Other studies examined the impact of DDIs on several medications which are major substrates of cytochrome P450 enzymes in children [58] .

All drugs have adverse effects, which can range from acute and mild (e.g., itching, headache) to severe and chronic (e.g., hepatotoxicity, druginduced lupus erythematosus). In order to minimize adverse effects and optimize clinical outcomes, healthcare providers must consider a drug's indication and clinical efficacy but must also identify potentially hazardous drug-drug interactions and engage in monitoring for drug-related toxicities. However, drug dosing is not straightforward, and patientspecific factors such as weight, age, renal/hepatic function, and genetic polymorphisms can lead to unanticipated drug effects, especially with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic window. Because many large clinical trials exclude patients with varying degrees of renal/hepatic dysfunction, extremes of age, and other distinguishing characteristics as a means to promote safety, providers who are involved in the care of special populations are often left to case reports and animal studies to assess the risks and benefits of therapy in their patients. Our review examined how simulated modeling of drug pharmacokinetics is also being utilized for this purpose, and our results show an increase in the utilization of PBPK modeling within the last decade, particularly for predicting the outcomes of drug-drug interactions and understanding how kinetics are altered in special populations of patients who are often times underrepresented in large-scale clinical trials.",

In addition, the therapeutic areas which experienced the highest proportions of growth during this time period were infectious diseases and neurology, experiencing a 16-fold and 12-fold increase in the annual number of publications, respectively. The increase in models within these therapeutic areas over the last several years is suggestive of efforts to maintain better safety and efficacy profiles for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices and/or difficult-to-predict doses. Our results show that the utilization of modeling for a particular disease state appears to be inversely proportional to the prevalence of that disease state, meaning that the number of published articles increases as the number of patients available to participate in clinical studies decreases. The abundance of oncologically focused studies is due in part to the challenges with feasibility of clinical studies involving these medications (e.g., low patient population, chronic disease progress which makes follow-up difficult), but also because patients with cancer have a variety of comorbidities which can influence drug disposition, such as renal/hepatic impairment, immune deficiency, GI absorption issues, etc. For patients with cancer, PBPK modeling offers greater control over patient parameters compared to clinical trials and can be used to guide dosing strategies in patients with a multitude of comorbidities.",

In this instance, the authors utilized Simcyp for the prediction of ribociclib exposure in the presence of CYP3A4 inhibitors. Based on their findings, they made a formal recommendation to amend the package insert to state that ribociclib should be avoided in the presence of CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers. Similarly, literature contributed by Arya and Shebley was used to recommend an update to the package labeling for dasabuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus's RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, due to their modeling efforts which showed a dangerous increase in drug exposure in the presence of CYP2C8 inhibitors [67, 68] .",

The guidance letter goes on to state that PBPK studies are permitted to be utilized in lieu of prospective DDI studies for investigational drugs and moderate-to-weak inhibitors of their metabolism provided that these models can be verified using human PK data and prospective DDI studies which investigated the effects of strong inhibitors or inducers.",

Another major barrier to use has been the challenges associated with model validation. Because PBPK modeling is geared generally towards utilization in difficult-to-predict clinical scenarios or situations where obtaining human data is unethical or impractical, there is a great deal of disagreement on the appropriate strategies for model validation. Currently, model validation is accomplished with data from animal studies, which is not always a reliable predictor of kinetics in humans or based on human data from pharmacokinetic studies on drugs which are similar to the study drug.",

Although we used the most generic search terms possible for our literature search, it is unlikely that we were able to pull and analyze all of the qualifying articles published from 2012 to 2018.
