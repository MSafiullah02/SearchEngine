            "text": "The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) swept across the globe, with reported cases in more than 30 countries. As of July 11, 2003 , the number of reported probable cases was 8437, with 813 deaths (1 ). A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was promptly implicated as the causative agent (2) (3) (4) . Macaques infected with SARS-CoV subsequently developed respiratory symptoms and pathology similar to SARS patients, thus fulfilling the Koch postulates (5 ) . Efforts in sequencing the viral genome promptly followed, and the genomic sequence revealed little homology to previously characterized strains of coronaviruses (6, 7 ) . The complete genomic sequences of several SARS-CoV isolates have since been made publicly available (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).",

In general, based on these sequence variations, the majority of the isolates can be segregated into two groups: isolates that were obtained from individuals who were epidemiologically linked to and those who were not linked to the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong (8 -10 ) . Ruan et al. (10 ) compared the genomic sequences of 14 SARS-CoV isolates and suggested that a haplotype comprising four nucleotide positions, namely, 9404, 17564, 22222, and 27827 [GenBank accession no. AY274119 (7 )], clearly defined two distinct genotypes. Isolates that were epidemiologically linked to the Metropole Hotel cluster have the configuration T:T:T:T, as opposed to the sequence C:G:C:C seen in the unassociated strains. (Note: The usage of the DNA-based code for the designation of SARS-CoV haplotypes does not imply that this virus possesses a DNA genome.) SARS was first reported in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002 (11 ) . Isolates that demonstrated the C:G:C:C haplotype were epidemiologically traceable to the early part of the epidemic (9 ) . On the other hand, SARS was first reported in Hong Kong when a cluster of cases was noted among visitors to the Metropole Hotel. This case cluster comprised international travelers who subsequently brought SARS to other countries, including Vietnam, Canada, and Singapore (11 ) . Epidemiologic investigations revealed that the cases were traceable to a nephrologist from Guangdong Province, China, who checked into the hotel on February 21, 2003 (8, 11 ) . These data suggest that since the emergence of SARS-CoV in Clinical Chemistry 50, No. 1, 2004 southern China, at least two strains of the virus had emerged (9 ) .",

It would be of interest to determine whether this strain is related to either of the reported groups. This patient, designated A, presented to a hospital in Hong Kong on February 17, 2003, with a 2-day history of fever, chills, rigors, dry cough, and intense malaise. She resided in the US, but before symptom onset, she had been visiting her ailing mother in Guangzhou, China. Her mother died on February 12, 2003, of a cause unknown to the family. After admission, patient A deteriorated rapidly and required intensive care. Her chest radiograph revealed patchy infiltration, and serologic testing subsequently showed markedly increased antibody titers against SARS-CoV. Four household members and two healthcare workers later developed fever and respiratory symptoms.",

Viral RNA was extracted from 280 L of the patient's serum with a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and eluted in 50 L of RNase-free water; 11 L of viral RNA was then reverse transcribed by Superscript III (Invitrogen) with reverse primers (PCR-R) targeting regions on the SARS-CoV genome that flank 20 selected polymorphic sites. Because polymorphisms seen in a single isolate could potentially be a result of culture or sequencing artifacts, we selected the target sites based on polymorphisms that were shared by at least two SARS-CoV isolates published in GenBank at the time of this study. The product was then amplified with use of 14 pairs of forward (PCR-F) and reverse (PCR-R) primers in a cDNA polymerase mixture (BD Clontech), with initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 min and 35 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 0.5 min, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 0.5 min, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 1.5 min, and a final extension at 68\u00b0C for 10 min. Seminested PCR was performed with the PCR-F and BSEQ-R series of primers with the same thermal profile. Primer sequences are available in the Data Supplement accompanying the online version of this Technical Brief at http://www. clinchem.org/content/vol50/issue1/.

This is particularly interesting in view of the epidemiologic history of patient A. She had a history of travel to southern China, whereas her presentation clearly predated the Metropole Hotel cluster.

Thus, there is both temporal and molecular evidence to suggest that CUHK-L2 and CUHK-W1 may represent two transitory strains of SARS-CoV that bridge the evolution between the earlier SARS-CoV strains and those that are linked to the Metropole Hotel. These data confirm that during the early part of the epidemic, the SARS-CoV was undergoing gradual evolution. However, at present, it is uncertain whether these cumulative changes contributed to the infectivity and propagation efficiency of the SARS-CoV and, thus, the development of the SARS epidemic. It remains to be seen whether this evolutionary transition of the SARS-CoV may have implications on a possible future reemergence of SARS.",
