The annual worldwide incidence of pneumonia in children <5 years old is estimated 120 million approximately, of which \u223c1.3 million cases lead to death [1]. The world-wide case fatality ratio is estimated to be around 8.7% for severe pneumonia. Most mortality occurs in the younger age group. Specifically, 81% of all pneumonia deaths occur in children <2< years old [2]. These figures have largely improved since the eighties, when childhood respiratory tract infections accounted for 4\u20135 million childhood deaths per year [3].",

Only a few countries do not vaccinate against HiB; in 2012, 180 countries introduced HiB-vaccine and 86 countries PCV [1]. The estimated reduction of the HiB- and PCV on radiologically confirmed (RC) pneumonia is \u223c18% and \u223c26% respectively [8].

However, 51% of these children had comorbidity (mainly asthma) thus this population cannot be fully compared with previously healthy children. This might also explain the low incidence of bacterial infection [26]. In a Chinese serological study aimed at determining viral and atypical bacterial respiratory infection in \u223c10,000 hospitalized children, Mycoplasma pneumonia was found to be the main causative agent, followed by adenovirus and influenza B-virus. However, since only serology was used, many viral and bacterial organisms could not be found [27]. These figures were confirmed by another study using serology and PCR that found that 17.5% of CAP cases were caused by atypical pathogens [28].",

This has been confirmed in prospective randomized observational studies in pediatric patients with proven lobar pneumonia looking at clinical, laboratory and radiological outcomes (penicillin vs. cefuroxime) [55]. For example, the PIVOT trial prospectively compared low dose oral amoxicillin (24 mg/kg/d; TID) with IV penicillin followed by low dose oral amoxicillin in 246 children hospitalized with RCCAP >6 months old in the United Kingdom. Oral amoxicillin was clinically equivalent to IV penicillin regarding the time to resolution of fever and hypoxia. The oral intervention was cost-effective [57]. However, children with most severe pneumonia were excluded. Naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were taken for viral PCR but no results were described [56]. In 104 children with very severe pneumonia, IV oxacillin/ceftriaxone combination therapy was prospectively compared with IV amoxicillin-clavulanic acid monotherapy (normal dose). The amoxicillin-clavulanic acid group did significantly better with respect to tachypnoea improvement and hospital length of stay [58]. The latter can probably be fully explained by the fact that IV amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was switched to oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid after 48 h in case of improvement.",

In under-fives with RCCAP in a region with low pneumococcal penicillin resistance, oral amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day) BD was as efficacious as TID dosing [63]. These results must be interpreted with caution, because of the impossibility to distinguish viral from bacterial pneumonia on chest radiograph. Twice daily normal dose amoxicillin was also used in comparative studies of amoxicillin with co-trimoxazole [32]. A pharmacokinetic study compared BD with TID dosing of 50 mg/kg/d amoxicillin in young children and concluded that the time above MIC was probably insufficient for higher concentration levels. Therefore, a 60\u201380 mg/kg/d dose should be considered in BD dosing [64].",

Pulmonary samples are hard to obtain, therefore surrogate markers from the upper respiratory tract are often used. The available etiologic studies are incomparable because of the different sampling methods, laboratory techniques, and definition of pneumonia among the studies. From the summarized studies, it seemed that in 15\u201325% bacterial etiology is probable, except for the study of Honkinen, who detected bacteria in the induced sputum of 91% of hospitalized children (culture and PCR) and the study of Pavia (40\u201360% nasopharyngeal bacteria, culture) [23], [25]. In the majority of children from the Honkinen study, the sputum was aspirated trough the nostrils, probably also retrieving nasopharyngeal pathogens. The positive predictive value of nasopharyngeal bacterial pathogens reflecting lower respiratory tract pathogens is not optimal. Therefore, it cannot be concluded whether nasopharyngeal pathogens are only colonizing the respiratory tract or also are the pneumonia-causing pathogen. Most etiology studies investigated clinical CAP-cases and might therefore not represent non-severe CAP. At a hospital level, there is a higher chance for a bacterial cause of CAP compared to the community level [6]. It is clear that viruses play an important role in the majority of childhood CAP, especially in the under-fives. Because viruses (mainly RSV, HRV and influenza) seem to play an important role in severe CAP, they might even play a more important role in non-severe CAP. However, respiratory viruses are also detected in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children, but with less frequency compared to cases [21], [26].",

But in an industrialized city setting, more experience and diagnostics are available to establish the severity of the clinical pneumonia. Unfortunately, a rapid and reliable test to distinguish viral- from bacterial pneumonia is still lacking in this setting; only then its treatment can be fully rationalized. Decision rules are currently being explored to decrease the number of children that are prescribed antibiotics in case of probable viral CAP (personal communication) [80].",

            "text": "In young children, cough and fast breathing without fever do not justify antibiotics. Watchful waiting with a return visit is suggested. It is impossible to distinguish pneumonia from bronchiolitis or viral wheeze based on the WHO criteria alone. In case of clinical severe pneumonia with fever or RCCAP, oral amoxicillin is proven to be effective in the majority of children and equivalent or superior compared to co-trimoxazole. Oral amoxicillin is equivalent to IV narrow-spectrum beta-lactam, and IV narrow-spectrum beta-lactam treatment is not inferior to broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics. The doses of amoxicillin used in the cited studies vary. Therefore, it is difficult to compare whether the clinical effect is depending on the dose. A normal dose (40\u201350 mg/kg/d; TID) would be sufficient in a setting with low levels of penicillin resistance. BD dosing is questioned because of failure of some patients to reach a concentration > MIC > 50% of time. In case of high-level penicillin resistance, BD dosing is not preferred. The duration for probable uncomplicated bacterial pneumonia should not extend 5 days. Based on small studies, macrolide antibiotics are not inferior to beta-lactam antibiotics, but also not proven to be superior, not even in older children. In addition, beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy was never shown to be clearly beneficial but there is a lack of good studies. Because of the rapid development of macrolide resistance; small-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics are preferred in case of CAP. There is no reason to initiate a second or third generation cephalosporin treatment in uncomplicated CAP in a vaccinated child without recent pretreatment. These might be indicated in case of suspected gram-negative or S. aureus after influenza infection, severe pneumonia or in children with a previous medical history. There is hardly evidence for adjunctive therapies in childhood CAP.",

For children with more severe CAP with fever, oral amoxicillin or narrow-spectrum IV beta-lactam therapy would be the first choice. There is no clear evidence for superiority of a macrolide-based regimen for all ages. Five days should be enough to treat uncomplicated pneumonia and the dosage will depend on local penicillin resistance rates. Broad-spectrum therapy covering beta-lactamase producing bacteria is warranted in the case of very severe disease or pre-treated children.",
