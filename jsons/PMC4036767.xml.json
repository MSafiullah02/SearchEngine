            "text": "Frederic Remington was an American painter, sculptor, illustrator, and writer whose works frequently featured cowboys, Native Americans, soldiers, horses, bison, and other iconic features of the rapidly vanishing American West. During his 25-year career, Remington produced \u22483,000 paintings and drawings, 22 bronze sculptures, a novel, a Broadway play, and more than 100 articles and stories. Remington was 48 years old when he died of peritonitis, a complication of an emergency appendectomy.",

Nancy Anderson, curator of American and British Paintings at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, wrote that \u201cIn these experimental, complex, and deeply personal paintings, Remington explored the technical and aesthetic difficulties of painting darkness. Surprisingly, his images are filled with color and light\u2014moonlight, firelight, candlelight.\u201d Many of those paintings also depict danger from humans, animals, or nature, as implied and real threats, sometimes revealed to the viewer and sometimes suggested by the posture or action of Remington\u2019s subjects.",

In this painting, four cowboys relax around a small outside a cabin. A plume of smoke rises toward the clear blue-green night sky flecked with a few stars, past a large skin hanging on the side of the cabin. The cabin does not overwhelm the painting but details such as the shadow under the roofline, the seams between logs, the softened edges of the structure, and the tautly stretched skin reveal Remington\u2019s deftness at rendering textures. His use of subdued colors punctuated by the reflected firelight underscores the quiet of the evening\u2019s respite following a long day\u2019s work.",

Despite a rifle standing within reach just to the left of the bunkhouse door, this painting does not suggest the foreboding sense of danger characteristic of many of Remington\u2019s other nocturnes. As the evening\u2019s ritual of cigarettes, coffee, and conversation plays out, the cowboy to the left squats and smokes, perhaps telling a story or swapping tales about days gone by.",

Crossing the plains and deserts by horseback, wagon, or train may have exposed settlers to airborne fungal spores that can cause coccidioidomycosis, commonly called \u201ccocci\u201d or \u201cvalley fever.\u201d As cabins, then towns, then cities were built, crowded conditions afforded more opportunities for exposures to pathogens from animal hosts, such as rodents and bats.",
