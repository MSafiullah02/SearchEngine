Several pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, and epidemic H1N1 influenza, have attracted widespread attention, and confer increased risk for ARDS.9 Additional patient risk factors include gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic silent aspiration, and drug exposures.5\n,\n10\n",
