            "text": "In the first twin study of autism (Folstein & Rutter, 1977), the concordance rate in monozygotic (MZ) pairs (36%) was significantly greater than that found in dizygotic (DZ) pairs (0%). If the phenotype was expanded to include a cognitive or a language disorder, the concordance rates were 82 and 10%, respectively. Two subsequent studies found an MZ/DZ concordance rate of 91\u20130% (Steffenburg et al., 1989) or 60\u20135% utilizing the specific phenotype, and 90% vs. 10% using the broader phenotype which included social or cognitive deficits (Bailey et al., 1995). Across twin studies of autism, the difference between MZ and DZ concordance rates is sizable, averaging roughly 10:1 (Pennington, 2009). This rate is greater than that for other psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (between 2:1 and 4:1), indicating a high heritability for autism (Pennington, 2009). On the other hand, there was great variability in IQ and clinical behaviors in the 16 MZ pairs concordant for autism in the (Bailey et al., 1995) study. In other words, there was no more similarity for these traits within MZ pairs than that between individuals picked at random from different MZ pairs who also had autism. As interpreted by Pennington (2009), this finding suggests that although autism is heritable, the genes may not dictate the exact phenotype. Nonadditive interaction among genes (epistasis) and nonshared environmental influences likely contribute to these differences in phenotypes. Further, the large disparity between the MZ and the DZ concordance rates has been attributed to epistasis (Pennington, 2009). Alternatively, rare gene variants causing a common disorder (autism), as described below, could contribute to this large MZ/DZ discordance.",

            "text": "Individuals with autism rarely marry and have children so that vertical transmission of the diagnosis from parent to child is rarely observed (Pennington, 2009). However, genetic transmission is still possible as parents can transmit genetic risk factors without having the diagnosis themselves. Family studies (cited in Geschwind & Konopka, 2009; Pennington, 2009) suggest that the risk of autism is 20\u201360% higher in siblings compared to the incidence of autism in the general population, and to that of other psychiatric disorders. Several studies have shown that a broad autism phenotype is transmitted in families of individuals with autism (Piven, 1999; Rutter, 2000). For example, first-degree relatives of individuals with autism were shown to be shy, aloof, and have problematic pragmatic language (Rutter, 2000). This pattern is consistent with the segregation of sub-threshold traits within these families (Abrahams & Geschwind, 2008).",

The predominantly male ratio has been attributed to an abnormality on the X chromosome (discussed below), or to sex linkage or genomic imprinting (Lintas & Persico, 2009; Marco & Skuse, 2006). Sex linkage involves a gene on the X chromosome transmitted from the mother to the son. As the son has only one X chromosome, this gene would be expressed. Since the mother\u2019s daughter has two copies of the X chromosome \u2013 one from her father and one from her mother \u2013 the daughter likely would not express the abnormal phenotype. The most well-known example of a sex-linked disorder is hemophilia, which is on the X chromosome. Genomic imprinting, on the other hand, is an epigenetic phenomenon wherein chemical modification of DNA that does not alter the basic DNA sequence or modification of the DNA-associated histone proteins determines whether the maternal or the paternal copy of a specific gene is expressed. Genomic imprinting has been determined for Prader Willi and Angelman\u2019s syndrome.",

            "text": "Abrahams and Geschwind (2008) write that two views underlie genetic autism research. The first is that rare variants involve an abnormality in a single molecule causing the clinical pathology in autism. Mendelian inheritance (autosomal dominant vs. recessive) takes this form. Technology compatible with this approach includes cytogenetics (including karyotyping and FISH), gene association studies (analysis of genes and protein system from less complex genetic syndromes similar to autism such as Rett and fragile X syndromes), linkage studies (including genome screens in affected sibling pairs), microarray technology, and CNV analysis. The second view involves the study of independent hereditary endophenotypes representing the core features of autism. An endophenotype is an operationally defined behavioral feature such as age of first spoken word. Although there is a general consensus regarding endophenotypes commonly seen in autism, the behaviors may not be specific to autism, as delay in language acquisition accompanies many developmental disorders. Ideally, endophenotypes represent discreet behaviors which do not overlap with other behaviors from the autism core domains (i.e., language, socialization, and rigid behavior). For example, poor eye contact, representing a deficit with socialization, is construed as being independent of repetitive behaviors, thought to represent the rigid behavior domain. Genetic study of these discreet endophenotypes, largely undertaken via linkage studies, narrows the scope of analysis (Losh et al., 2008; O\u2019Roak & State, 2008).",

This syndrome, associated with mental retardation and autistic features, is more severely expressed in males. FXS is caused by a deficiency of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), resulting from little or none of the disease gene fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) mRNA. The FMR1 gene mutation consisting of expanded CGG repeats of > 200 at chromosome site Xq27.3 is considered the origin of FXS. Autism, using the broad definition, has been reported in up to 30% of males with FXS, and FXS can be found in as many as 7\u20138% of individuals with autism (Muhle, Trentacoste, & Rapin, 2004). Later studies, using DNA measures of the fragile X mutation rather than cytogenetics and strict autism criteria, have found a smaller association between FXS and autism (Pennington, 2009). Two investigations, however, which studied carefully controlled groups of FXS-negative and FXS-positive males matched on intelligence, found higher rates of the following autistic symptoms in FXS males: gaze avoidance and hand flapping (Einfeld, Molony, & Hall, 1989) and stereotypic movements (including hand flapping, rocking, and hitting, scratching, or rubbing their own bodies), echolalia, gaze avoidance, and ritualistic behaviors (Maes, Fryns, Van Walleghem, & Van den Berghe, 1993). Studies of endophenotype behaviors rather than the strict autism criteria are more likely to uncover robust similarities between FXS and autism.",

FMRP has been shown to interact with multiple transcripts in repressing metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 (mGluR5) signaling activity which regulates long-term depression (LTD) associated with synaptic elimination. Without FMRP acting as a \u201cbrake,\u201d mGluR\u2013LTD is enhanced (Bear, Huber, & Warren, 2004). This favors an anabolic state which could contribute to the key features of FXS such as epilepsy, cognitive impairment, loss of motor coordination, and increased density of thin, long, dendritic spines in neurons (Bear, 2005). These observations have invited drug trials of glutamate receptor antagonists to reduce the expression of mGluR5 (Dolen et al., 2007) in individuals with FXS and in individuals with autism.",

            "text": "APP, which is encoded by a gene on chromosome 21, is a large (695\u2013770 amino acid) glycoprotein produced in several central nervous system (CNS) cell types including microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. After protein processing, mature APP is axonally transported and can be released from axon terminals in response to electrical activity. APP is believed to play an important role in neuronal maturation and in synaptogenesis as reviewed by Lahiri, Farlow, Greig, Giacobini, and Schneider (2003). APP is of great interest because processing products of APP can include the insoluble 40\u201342-amino acid amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2-40 and A\u03b2-42, respectively), the principal component of the cerebral plaques associated with memory and cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Alley et al., 2010). Recent research linking APP to autism illustrates how association studies enable the generation of new hypotheses about the biology of autism and ultimately advance our understanding of this disorder. Recently, we found evidence to support an association between autism and one of the APP pathways established for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In contrast to the upregulation of the amyloidogenic pathway as seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we found evidence that there may be an upregulation of the nonamyloidogenic (\u03b1-secretase amyloid precursor protein, sAPP\u03b1) pathway in a small sample of children with severe autism associated with self-injurious and aggressive behavior. That is, children with severe autism expressed total sAPP (representing the combined amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic pathways) at two or more times the levels of children without autism and up to four times the levels of children with mild autism (Sokol et al., 2006). Overall, there was a trend toward higher sAPP\u03b1 within the children with autism. One of the severely autistic children in this study had FXS. High levels of sAPP\u03b1 have also been found in a sample of children with autism from an independent laboratory (Bailey et al., 2008). High levels of sAPP\u03b1 imply an increased \u03b1-secretase pathway in autism (anabolic), opposite to what is seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This would be consistent with the brain overgrowth hypothesis attributed to autism, in contrast to the brain atrophy seen with the deposition of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Coincidentally, via animal studies, Westmark and Malter (2007) concluded that FMRP binds to and regulates translation of APP mRNA through mGLuR5, providing a potential link between neuronal proteins associated with AD and FXS. By way of mGluR5, FMRP provides the \u201cbrake,\u201d which if unchecked in conditions such as FXS would favor high levels of APP. Further, high levels of APP have been found in another study of FMR1 knockout mice (D\u2019Agata et al., 2002). These findings have led to enticing speculation that the APP gene may influence several neurodevelopmental disorders across the life span.",

One of these translocation breakpoints identified the deranged gene as RAY1/ST7 (FAM4A1), a putative tumor suppressor gene (Vincent et al., 2002), and work in this region is ongoing. Mutations leading to amino acid changes have been found on the WNT2 gene on 7q31 in two families with autism, and one affected parent transmitting the mutation to two affected children (Li et al., 2004; Wassink, Brzustowicz, Bartlett, & Szatmari, 2004). The FOXP2 gene on 7q31 was found to be disrupted in one family with an autosomal dominant form of specific language impairment (SLI) (Lai, Fisher, Hurst, Vargha-Khadem, & Monaco, 2001), and this was replicated in a larger study of SLI (O\u2019Brien, Zhang, Nishimura, Tomblin, & Murray, 2003), although initial studies failed to associate this with autism (Newbury et al., 2002; Wassink et al., 2001). Recently, FOXP2 differences in gene expression were found between chimp and human cell cultures (Konopka et al., 2009). Compared to chimps, in human culture, the FOXP2 gene affected transcription upregulation in 61 genes and downregulation in 55 genes. Further, the FOXP2 gene was shown to regulate downstream effects involving cerebellar motor function, craniofacial formation, and cartilage and connective tissue formation required for expressive language. As discussed in section \u201cEndophenotype,\u201d there is a suspected association between the chromosome 7q region and speech abnormality seen in autism.",

Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter and aberrant glutamate function has long been suspected to contribute to autism. Neuroligins induce presynaptic differentiation in glutamate axons. SHANK3 encodes for a postsynaptic scaffolding protein which regulates the structural organization of dendritic spines in neurons. Consequently, SHANK3 is a binding partner of neuroligins. Neurexin induces glutamate postsynaptic differentiation in contacting dendrites. Altogether, these genes appear to contribute to glutamatergic synapse formation.",

Derangement in cell adhesion could contribute to migrational abnormalities including brain overgrowth. Neuroligins are cell-adhesion molecules localized postsynaptically at both glutamatergic (NLGN1, NLGN3, NLGN4, NLGN4Y) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acidergic (NLGN2) synapses (Lintas & Persico, 2009). Neuroligins trigger the formation of functional presynaptic structures in contacting axons. As mentioned above, they interact with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins such as SHANK3 (see below). The NLGN3 and NLGN4 genes are located at chromosomes Xq13 and Xq22, 33, respectively, and mutations here have been associated with autism Jamain et al. (2003). Extensive genetic screens conducted by several research groups have confirmed the low frequency of neuroligin mutations among individuals with autism (Lintas & Persico, 2009). For example, Jamain et al. (2003) found a frameshift mutation in NLGN4 and a missense mutation in NLGN3 in two unrelated Swedish families, inherited from unaffected mothers. Laumonnier et al. (2004) reported a frameshift mutation in NLGN4 in 13 affected male members of a single pedigree. Lawson-Yuen, Saldivar, Sommer, and Picker (2008) found a deletion of exons 4\u20136 of NLGN4 in a boy with autism and in his brother with Tourette syndrome whose mother showed psychiatric problems and also carried the mutation. Neuroligin mutation carriers, however, display a variety of syndromes, such as X-linked mental retardation without autism (Laumonnier et al., 2004), Asperger\u2019s syndrome, autistic disorder of variable severity, and PDD-NOS (Yan et al., 2005). The symptoms may be slow, or abrupt and associated with regression. Despite intensive investigation, the low frequency of neuroligin mutations and the lack of similar phenotypes have led to the recommendation that neuroligins should not be included in widespread screens for individuals with nonsyndromic autism (Lintas & Persico, 2009).",

            "text": "The SHANK3 gene is located on chromosome 22q13.3 which encodes for a scaffolding protein found in the postsynaptic density complex of excitatory synapses binding to neuroligins. Recently, two studies have reported a correlation between mutations affecting SHANK3 and an autism phenotype characterized by severe verbal and social deficits (Durand et al., 2007; Moessner et al., 2007). Of the seven patients reported with the SHANK3 gene mutations, five were deletions, one was a missense, and another a frameshift mutation. In addition, rare SHANK3 variations were present in the autism group, but not in the control group. These variations were inherited from healthy parents and they were present in unaffected siblings, perhaps demonstrating incomplete penetrance. Another interesting observation is that in both studies (Durand et al., 2007; Moessner et al., 2007), the SHANK3 deletion was inherited via a paternal balanced translocation. Further, in both studies, siblings of the probands with SHANK3 abnormalities had partial 22q13 trisomy that resulted in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (Moessner et al., 2007) and Asperger\u2019s syndrome with early language development (Durand et al., 2007). Like neuroligins, SHANK3 mutations are very rare. However, because of the robust genotype\u2013phenotype correlation reported in two studies (Durand et al., 2007; Moessner et al., 2007), it has been recommended that children with severe language and social impairment obtain SHANK3 mutation screening (Lintas & Persico, 2009).",

Incomplete penetrance may explain these findings, or autism may be caused by neurexin acting synergistically with other susceptibility genes. Neurexin-1\u03b1 is being intensely studied in mice as deletion in this molecule resulted in increased repetitive behavior, whereas social behavior was relatively intact (Etherton, Blaiss, Powell, & Sudhof, 2009).

CNTNAP2 has been associated with an autism language phenotype in large studies of non-Amish individuals (Alarcon et al., 2008). Further, stage two of this investigation showed that CNTNAP2 was expressed in the language centers (frontal and anterior temporal lobes) of fetal brain (Alarcon et al., 2008).

This gene has been studied in children with autism, and MeCP2 mutations are considered to be rare (0.8\u20131.3%) in females with autism. Interestingly, autism and Rett syndrome share some similarities at the phenotypic and pathogenic levels, and both disorders were proposed to result from disruption of postnatal or experience-dependent synaptic plasticity (Zoghbi, 2003).

These markers are distributed within the entire genome rather than limited to specific gene regions such as in the sib\u2013pair method. This enables a more unbiased ascertainment of regions of interest (Losh et al., 2008). Several genome-wide scans of individuals with autism have been reported and evidence in favor of linkage has been determined for the majority of chromosomes (Gupta & State, 2007). The trouble with these studies is that the evidence has not reached statistical significance and there is lack of replication for many of these findings. Statistical significance is calculated by a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score. This score represents the logarithm of the likelihood ratio of observing the data under a model of linkage to observing the data under a model of free recombination (no linkage). An LOD score of 3.5 in a sib\u2013pair analysis is considered to be a significant linkage (Lander & Kruglyak, 1995). Suggestive linkage is an LOD score of 2.2, and a highly significant LOD score is 5.4. For replication studies, the replication threshold is considered to be 1.4 (Lander & Kruglyak, 1995). By chance, one would expect to see a suggestive linkage peak once every genome scan or a significant peak once every 20 scans (Gupta & State, 2007).",

AGRE is a publically available resource of phenotypic data and biomaterials. Genomic scan linkage analysis was performed on 109 autistic sibling pairs from 91 AGRE families together with analysis of those pairs from an independent sample of 345 families from the same AGRE cohort (Cantor et al., 2005). When families with autism were stratified into only those with affected males, there was significant linkage at 17q11-21 in both samples. The LOD score for this replicated work was at genome-wide level of significance (LOD score > 1.4). One positional candidate gene close to this region is the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) which codes for a protein controlling the reuptake of serotonin in the synapse. This was exciting as elevated levels of serotonin have been determined in 25\u201330% of cases of autism (Cook et al., 1990). Indeed, relationship between the SLC6A4 site and a repeat polymorphic region in its promoter region (5HTTLPR) recently has been independently investigated (Losh et al., 2008). The chromosome 17q locus, however, has not been uniformly observed in subsequent, large-scale studies (Schellenberg et al., 2006) which may be due to phenotypic heterogeneity.",

Equal amounts of DNA from patient and control are hybridized to known regions of the human genome pre-arrayed on a slide. If patient and control have equal copy numbers at a given locus, the color turns yellow, representing an equal measure of DNA.

            "text": "Specific language impairment (SLI) is defined as the failure of normal development of language without hearing loss, mental retardation, or oral motor, neurological, or psychiatric impairment. This affects approximately 7% of children entering school (Tomblin et al., 1997). Individuals with SLI perform poorly on phonologically based tasks and many go on to develop dyslexia (Stothard, Snowling, Bishop, Chipchase, & Kaplan, 1998). There appears to be neurostructural association between SLI and autism (Herbert et al., 2002; 2004), and there is an associated finding of language delay in relatives of probands with autism (Wassink et al., 2004). Several investigations have found strong linkage of SLI to chromosome 13q21 (Bartlett et al., 2002; 2004) and to chromosomes 16q and 19q (SLI Consortium, 2002, 2004). This finding is noteworthy as it directly overlies the 16q locus linked to autism (Wassink et al., 2004). A specific language marker, age of first word, has shown significant linkage to chromosome 7 observed by five separate investigators (Losh et al., 2008). The 7q region has been the subject of intense investigation, as described above, and may be the loci associated with autism language.",

(2003) identified two factors underlying RRB as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R): repetitive sensory motor actions and resistance to change. This is of interest as a genetic linkage signal has been reported for resistance to change on chromosome 15 (Shao et al., 2003).

The guidelines are dynamic rather than static and have been updated, for example, as aCGH has become more available. The stepwise approach was designed to balance cost with the expected yield of the tests. Further, there is a pyramidal effect so that \u201cearlier tiers have a greater expected diagnostic yield, lower invasiveness of testing, better potential of intervention, and easier overall practicality\u201d (Schaefer & Mendelsohn, 2008). Summarizing the diagnostic yields expected for the following investigations (high-resolution chromosome studies, 5%; aCGH \u2013 beyond that detected by chromosome analysis \u2013 10%; fragile X, 5%; MECP2, 5% women only; PTEN, 3% if head circumference >2.5 SD; other, 10%), it was predicted that utilization of these guidelines would lead to diagnosis in 40% of cases (Schaefer, Mendelsohn, and the Professional Practice and Guidelines Committee (2008). Finally, this stepwise approach has met the approval of third-party payers and families (Schaefer & Lutz, 2006).",
