Many people who are lucky enough to still have their jobs are working from home, often experimenting with video chats and virtual offices for the first time. Students are attending classes and visiting friends online, too. Covid-19 could change the internet as profoundly as it is changing our handwashing habits.",

People are using it to hold meetings with colleagues, teach university classes and have quarantine-compliant cocktail hours with friends. For those who don't want to be \u201cZoom-bombed\u201d, where an unwanted person joins the video call by exploiting bugs in the app, there are video features you can use in Skype, Google Hangouts and Discord.",

I used to set up extra chairs around the dining room table every Sunday evening, where my friends and I would spread out our maps, dice and snacks. Now most of the chairs are empty, and the table is covered in laptops instead: two for myself and my partner, and one for the Zoom session with our fellow adventurers.",
