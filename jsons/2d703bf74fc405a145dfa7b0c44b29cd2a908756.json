The disproportionate rate of case hospitalization and confirmed case decline between older and younger age groups is concerning. The shift from from older to younger population COVID-19 infection may mask a true decline in cases and the need for future health care capacity if the currently infected portion of the population is younger, less likely to report symptoms, and at less risk of a severe life-threatening disease requiring hospitalization.

Percent positive testing was variable over time and ranged from 12% (3/1/2020) to 5% (4/19/2020). Age distribution of persons tested changed by a small margin over time with an increase in testing among persons age 60 and older (+6%) and a decrease in testing among 0-19 and 20-39 year old (-3%) from the peak (3/22/2020) to the week of 4/19/2020, a statistically significant but small change [chi square = 263.87, p<.001]. Table 2. From the COVID-19 peak week (3/22/2020) to week 4/19/2020, COVID-19 hospitalization rate declined 49% for age 40 and older cases with a 54% decline in COVID-19 incidence. The hospitalization rate among age 20-39-year-olds declined 35% with 36% decline in confirmed positive cases from the peak. 3 Discussion Although morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection are highest among the infected population 60 years and older and those with underlying conditions, the percentage of 0-19 and 20-39-year-old cases in Washington State increased over time with no decline in cases age 0-19-year-old cases and a lesser decline among 20-39-year-old than observed in older age groups. Our results indicate a persistent high percentage of current infections in Washington State is among the age 0-19 and 20-39 population who may also be at highest risk of contracting and spreading the virus but not at high risk of hospitalization or mortality.
