DOCK8 is required for T lymphocyte, natural killer (NK) cell function and survival, dendritic cell migration, B-cell proliferation, immunoglobulin production, and antiviral cytokine production. [4] [5] [6] [7] Atopic dermatitis (AD), food allergy (FA), and wheezing are usually the initial symptoms of DOCK8 deficiency during the early infancy period. However, chronic or severe infections, autoimmunity, and cancer development may affect the course of the disease and survival. 8, 9 HSCT is the lifesaving therapy in DOCK8-deficient patients; it should be performed as early as possible, before the occurrence of malignancies and fatal infections. HSCT has been shown to cure nearly all clinical and laboratory manifestations of DOCK8 deficiency by reconstituting the normal function of the immune system. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Since the parental consanguinity rate is high (23.2%) in Turkey, DOCK8 deficiency has an important place among CIDs. Here, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical and immunologic features and treatment modalities of 20 patients with DOCK8 deficiency and follow-up results of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in 11 patients among them as a single-center experience.",

Circles show high values, squares show normal values, and triangles show laboratories' lower values according to the laboratories' was stopped in seven patients at a median of months (range: 6-14 months). One patient who was recently transplanted and three patients with cGvHD still continue to receive immunosuppressive treatment and IVIG replacement. As for laboratory results, eosinophilia disappeared in all patients during the post-HSCT period (median: 120/mm 3 , min-max: 0-330/ mm 3 ). Serum total IgE levels returned to normal or to near-normal levels in 10 patients [post-HSCT median: 40 kU/mL, min-max: 2-428]. Serum IgM levels were low in 8 of 11 and were normalized following transplantation in six patients. CD3+ T-cell counts were low in 6 of 11 patients, and CD4+ T-cell counts were low in 8 of 11 patients. After HSCT, all patients had normal CD3+ T, and CD4+ T-cell counts normalized in six patients. In two siblings with Omenn phenotype (P8 and P9), CD19+ B-cell levels reached normal levels after transplantation. In four patients, DOCK8 expression was examined by flow cytometry both pre-and post-HSCT. All patients had a significant increase in DOCK8 expression on T cells after HSCT. CD4+ CD45RA+ CD31+ T-cell (RTE) counts were low in eight patients based on age-specific normals at diagnosis (median: 71/ mm 3 , min-max: 42-1900/mm 3 ). RTE counts did not reach age-specific normal values but increased significantly (median: 179/mm 3 , min-max: 76-1200/mm 3 ).

Survival rates were higher in the patients receiving transplants before 8 years of age and receiving RIC (treosulfan based or reduced-dose busulfan) than those undergoing HSCT later than 8 years of age and receiving MAC. Of 73 patients with available chimerism data, 65 (89%) had >90% donor T-cell chimerism at the last follow-up.10 The outcome of HSCT even with different conditioning regimens, different GvHD prophylaxis, and different donors has been quite successful in all reported cases.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22] In our study, survival rate was 91% despite the fact that most of our patients had organ damage including severe inflammatory states and half of them had active infections at the time of HSCT.MAC consisting of busulfan 4 mg/kg/day and fludarabine 40 mg/ m 2 /day IV on days \u22125, \u22124, \u22123, and \u22122 was given to the first two patients transplanted with MRD as treosulfan could not be obtained at that time. Then, we preferred treosulfan-based RIC in patients who had a high risk of developing transplant-related toxicity, particularly SOS and infections. Complete chimerism was achieved in all patients except one (P13) who received RIC regimen and was transplanted from a haploidentical donor. OS was 91% in transplanted patients similar to previous studies.11",
