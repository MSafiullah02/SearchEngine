The N-acylbenzotriazole is an easy-to-handle acylating agent for advantageous N-, O-, C- and S-acylations.

In the first part of the twentieth century, the discovery and development of antibacterial drugs were major scientific achievements. Despite the investments in antimicrobial drugdiscovery, no new drug class has been found in the past 20 years [31]. Additionally, the difficulty to treat infections due to antibiotics resistance increase highlighted the urgency to develop new drugs [32]. For some decades, Sparatore and co-workers studied and characterized various nitrogen rings and reported that when BT is part of larger heterocyclic systems, it has biological activities, especially antibacterial [33], [34], [35]. In 1989 Sanna's research group also reported the relevance of benzotriazole moiety in triazolo[4,5-f]-quinolinone carboxylic acids (1) (Fig. 3\n), closely related to oxolinic acid. These acids showed encouraging in vitro antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values included between 12.5 and 25 \u03bcg/ml. Moreover, they demonstrated that annulations in different position of the triazole ring as in triazolo[4,5-h]-quinolinone carboxylic acids, induce a partial or total antimicrobial activity loss [36], [37].",

A simply substitution on BT generated 6-chloro-1H-benzotriazole (19, Fig. 16\n), a compound endowed with micromolar activity against Entamoeba histolytica. The biological behavior demonstrated that this scaffold, as indazole nucleus, is more active than metronidazole, the drug most commonly used in the treatment of anaerobic protozoan parasitic infections [27]. Pagliero's works demonstrated that compounds possessing the heterocyclic nucleus 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline linked to a benzenesulfonyle moiety showed protozoan antiparasitic properties [58], [59]. On this basis, through the fragment-based drug design strategy, Becerra's group designed and prepared a library of N1-benzenesulfonyl derivatives of BT [60]. Following the procedure reported by Katrinsky [61], all compounds were prepared by sulfonylation. The group determined the biological in vitro activity of N-benzenesulfonylbenzotriazole (20, Fig. 16) on the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Different concentrations of N-benzenesulfonylbenzotriazolewere tested on epimastigote and trypomastigote forms demonstrating that derivative had an in vitro growth inhibitory dose-dependent activity against epimastigotes. Particularly, after incubation for 72 h, the parasite number in epimastigotes form decreases of about 50% at 25 \u03bcg/mL and of 64% at 50 \u03bcg/mL. In the same conditions, BT, used as reference compound, did not show any anti-trypanosomal activity. Compound (20) appeared to be even more effective on trypomastigotes, the infective form of the parasite. Indeed, in earlier time points, a concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL of this compound induced a trypomastigotes dead 95% higher than in epimastigote forms. On the contrary, BT was less effective, causing only 21% of dead parasites at the same concentration [62].",

Unfortunately, in most cases a selectivity of action was not demonstrated [51], [54]. However, the structural model of the best-known antifungal drug fluconazole offers an interesting starting point for drug design studies. Indeed, the triazolic system can be replaced by a benzotriazole ring, in order to evaluate the effects of the bioisosteric replacement on the biological behavior. Concerning the mechanism of action, it is known that antimycotic drugs, such as fluconazole [66], itraconazole [67], voriconazole [68], ravuconazole [69] and posaconazole [70] exert their pharmacological action by inhibiting the fungal 14 \u03b1-demethylase cytochrome P450. Known as CYP51, this is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of sterols. In particular CYP51 removes the 14 \u03b1-methyl group of lanosterol using oxygen and NADPH by oxidation, transforming it into ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membranes [71]. These drugs act by displacing lanosterol from CYP51 binding site, causing a block in the biosynthesis of ergosterol and an accumulation of 14 \u03b1-methylsterols [72].",

Throughout drug-design studies, applying Autodock on MT-CYP51, the best in silico promising derivatives were synthesized and their antimycotic activity was compared to that of fluconazole and itraconazole, used as reference drugs [78].

Exceptionally, these compounds were endowed with activity against the dermatophyte Microsporum canis. Only some imidazole or 1,2,4-triazole derivatives appeared active compounds against all microbial species taken into account.

In particular fluoroquinolones, fluorine-containing derivatives of older quinolones such as nalidixic acid, are currently used as antitubercular agents in MDR-TB infections and, to a lesser extent, in case of severe adverse reactions to the conventional antituberculous regimen [118]. However, they are still classified as second-line drugs, since their use in tuberculosis treatment remains controversial [99]. This behavior is justified by the fact that the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in MDR strains is possible [119], even if it does not appear to be related to poor bactericidal activity but to rapid emergence of resistance at the doses used clinically, as seen for ciprofloxacin [120].",

Aiming to exploit the pharmaceutical peculiarities of this antibiotic class, Carta et al. created a new series of [1,2,3]Triazolo[4,5-h] and [4,5-f]quinolones with the purpose to obtain new more potent and selective agents against M. tb sensitive and resistant strains [37], [116], [117]. As reported by Milata review [125], the Carta's group discovered that only few triazolo[4,5-h]quinolone carboxylic acids exhibited interesting low MIC90 values (5.0\u20131.6 \u03bcg/mL), observing also that the activity was related to the length and position of the substituent at triazole-nitrogen. Compounds bearing methyl group at N3 showed the higher activity. This first observation prompted the group to focalize their work. They designed and selectively synthesized a series of 3-methyl-9-substituted-6-oxo-6,9-dihydro-3H-[1,2,3]-triazolo[4,5-h]quinolone-carboxylic acids (42) (Fig. 32\n). A variety of substituents on the quinolone nitrogen were introduced with the aim to improve the biological activity. All derivatives were tested against M. tb H37Rv and further 11 clinically isolated strains endowed with a wide spectrum of drug resistance. Derivative (42a) stood out as the most potent derivative, exhibiting MIC90 = 0.5 \u03bcg/mL against all tested strains.",

Human macrophages J774-A1 were infected with M. tb H37Rv strain and successively grown in the absence of antitubercular agent or in the presence of 0.5 and 0.25 \u00ecg/mL of lead compound. Both macrophage cultures were lysed 7 days after and the mycobacterial growth was estimated about 5000 and 8000 CFU/mL, respectively, while the untreated culture grew regularly. In addition, supplementary analysis reveled good antimycobacterial activity against several Mycobacterium avis paratuberculosis, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium bovis strains [126]. Further modifications of the substituents in N-3 and N-9 positions of the ring system with bulking groups do not improved the biological activity. Comparing new derivatives with previous series, methyl group was confirmed to be the most effective substituent in both positions [127]. Lastly, when MICs were determined against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as against Candida sp., all compounds resulted inactive (MIC = 64\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL). For this new class of quinolones these results suggested a specific antimycobacterial potential. This behavior was probably due to a different mechanism of action toward quinolones, leading them to be good candidates for further developments [128].",

Particularly, SAR studies demonstrated that the absence of substituents on benzotriazole position 5 caused a decrease in potency but not in efficacy. On the contrary, only a methoxy group adversely affected both properties. Furthermore, best results were reported for compounds bearing a simple methyl group. Experimental data suggested a potential relationship between the potency and steric hindrance in this position. Finally, the benzotriazole derivatives lacking the carboxamido group in position 4 of the triazole ring were totally powerless as vasorelaxing agents, demonstrating that the CONH2 group was an essential structural requirement to exert the vasorelaxing effect due to the potassium channels BK activation [131].",

The introduction of bulky and lipophilic groups, such as sec-butyl and phenyl, led to derivatives retaining equivalent potency, even if less potent than derivatives bearing a methyl group in the same position (Fig. 33, 43 series II). Alongside these derivatives was then prepared the 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-benzotriazole. This derivative showed good vasorelaxing activity, full efficacy and potency 10 times higher than the triazolyl benzotriazole derivatives bearing an H atom at position 5. The activity of the latter compound is significantly reduced by high levels of KCl (60 mM), suggesting a possible pharmacodynamic profile similar to that of drugs known as activators of potassium channels [132]. Finally, another series of 5-substituted-1-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzotriazoles (45), wherein the triazole group is replaced by a hydroxybenzoyl group, (Fig. 33, series III) was prepared. Thereby, thanks to the bridge determined by the carbonyl function, new molecules were ensured by greater degree of freedom and therefore flexibility between the two main parts. Biological analysis showed high vasorelaxing potency and efficacy for all derivatives. However, once again, the most potent derivative in this set was the one bearing a methyl group at 5position, which also showed t cardioprotective properties. In contrast, both the introduction of the 2-hydroxyphenyl group in benzotriazole ring position 1 and the replacement of the carbonyl bridge (an electron withdrawing group) with a methylene bridge caused a considerable decrease of the biological activity [133].",

Thereafter, these cells proliferate and form a clone of neoplastic cells, characterized by lack of control proliferation. Concomitantly cells lose potential replicative control and becomes immortal. Additionally, the mechanism for density-dependent inhibition, which usually allows the cells to multiply until they reach a finite cell density (point at which they become quiescent), is deactivated. Tumors are classified in benign and malignant, depending on the biological and morphological characteristics which determine a greater or lesser aggressiveness. The most common cancers are lung cancer (1.4 million deaths), stomach cancer (740.000 deaths), liver cancer (700.000 deaths), colorectal cancer (610.000 deaths) and breast cancer (460.000 deaths) [136].",

Previously it was reported that carbocyclic nucleosides (obtained by replacing oxygen with a sugar-CH2 group) were more stable to the enzymatic action of nucleoside phosphorylase and they were also equipped with anti-tumor activity [145], [146], [147]. On this basis, Zhan and Lou decided to further modify the nucleoside analogues structure, replacing the heterocycle base with various polynitrogen heterocycles. With this aim azole nucleoside analogues of D-pinitol (=3-O-methyl-D-chiro-inositol) (47a\u2013d) were synthesized passing through the key intermediate 3-O-methyl-4,5-epoxy-D-chiro-inositol (46). The different analogues of D-pinitol were tested on tumor cell lines derived from human lung and bladder, but only derivatives with triazole (46a) and benzotriazole (46b) substitution were active, albeit at micromolar level, as shown in Fig. 34\n.",

It is believed that the CK2 is involved in cell growth, both in healthy and cancerous cells [165], in the synthesis of tRNA and mRNA [166], as well as in apoptosis and in cell transformation. The CK2 has been described for the first time by Burnett and Kennedy [167] and different isoforms were identified [168], [169]. However, the CK2 conventionally exists either in form of tetrameric complexes, composed of two catalytic subunits (\u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032, or \u03b1\u2033) [170], [171], [172] and two regulatory subunits (\u03b2 and \u03b2\u2032), or as free subunits [173], [174]. There are also indications that tetrameric CK2 can be assembled into more complex structures. There are increasing evidences to suggest that different molecular forms of CK2 may be involved in different cellular activities. For instance, some substrates of CK2 can only be phosphorylated by tetrameric CK2, while others are phosphorylated exclusively by the free catalytic subunits [175]. Also, proteins able to interact with CK2 have been identified, and some of these discriminate between tetrameric CK2 and individual subunits [176].",

Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the CK2 shows oncogenic activity in transgenic mice and is frequently over-expressed in tumor and leukemia cells [179], [180], [181]. Finally, the high constitutive activity of CK2 is suspected to contribute to its pathogenic potential, since it is exploited by several viruses to exert the phosphorylation of proteins essential to their life cycle [182]. Furthermore, the catalytic subunit \u03b1 cooperates with other protooncogenes to promote cell transformation in different experimental models [179].

The three kinases inhibited by TBBt were CDK2 and GSK3L, belonging to the same protein kinase subfamily (named CMGC group), and PHK, belonging to the CaMK group. Moreover, within the same CK family, TBBt turns out to be more selective against CK2 (Ki = 0.4 \u03bcM) in comparison with CK1 (Ki = 47 \u03bcM) [183]. A third class of CK proteins, localized to the Golgi apparatus, was instead totally unresponsive to TBBt [184]. All this evidences suggested that TBBt possess a particular selectivity only towards CK2 as inhibitor agent. This behavior, combined with the molecular ability to penetrate inside the cell and the lack of evident short term cytotoxicity made the TBBt a promising lead to design new compounds with high therapeutic potential.",

They evaluated the influence on TBBt/TBBi inhibitory potency of TBBt/TBBi derivatives bearing alkyl substituents with different hydrophobic, steric and electrophilic features. Their research program was based on the evidence that water molecules, necessary for enzymatic activity, were coordinated at the binding site on CK2 [188], molecules that could be displaced by similar substituents. New N-hydroxyalkyl derivatives (65) were then tested on human CK2 holoenzyme (\u03b12\u03b22). Evidences demonstrated that the pharmacological activity depended on alkyl chain length. Some of the N-hydroxyalkyl derivatives showed IC50 values similar to that of the parent compounds, and best results were ensures by the propan-1-olic chain, with IC50 values of 0.48 \u03bcM [196]. In 2009, the group investigated the effects of bulkier alkyl chains, with both hydrophobic and polar properties. Once again, the 3-(4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)propan-1-ol (65a) appears to be the best of the series, with small differences from the N2-substituted derivative (65b) (Fig. 46\n). On the contrary, for derivatives bearing shorter or longer alkyl chains a drastic decrease in their activity was observed. Additionally they demonstrated that the four bromine atoms in the benzene ring seemed to be an essential requirement for biological activity. Indeed, the substitution of bromine with chlorine or CH3 groups leads to significantly lower inhibitory effect versus different forms of CK2, human and not. The relevance of the triazole system was finally underlined by its replacement with a phthalimide moiety, feature present in many biologically active compounds [197], [198], or with a phthalazine system. Indeed, the derivatives thus obtained resulted powerless [199].",

The derivative of substitution in 2 showed a potent in vitro SOD activity, with 0.06 \u03bcM IC50 value, comparable with data reported in literature for other mimicking SOD agents.

The group synthesized various benzotriazole compounds bearing substituted benzoic acids. Their antitumor activity was evaluated on three different human tumor cell lines. Compounds showed moderate antiproliferative activity with the exception for 1H-Benzo[d][1,2,3]triazol-1-yl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (71). This compound stood out with an IC50 value of 1.2\u20132.4 nM, very close to that of positive control doxorubicin. The SAR analysis emphasized the relevance of the OCH3 group for the antiproliferative activity. In fact, derivatives bearing such substituents at benzoic ring positions 3, 4 and 5 were the most powerful, while methoxyl substitution of benzotriazole group resulted in a drastic reduction of antiproliferative activity [217]. The HDAC inhibitory activity was determined using HeLa nuclear extract as the enzyme source, taking trichostatin (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (HSA) as reference drugs. Analyzing quantitative experimental results obtained it was clear that the more potent derivative was once again the trimethoxy derivative, in agreement with the antiproliferative activity results. This derivative was finally subjected to molecular docking studies to simulate its interactions with the HDAC using the AUTODOCK 4.0 software [218]. The analysis highlighted the hydrophobic interactions between the benzotriazole and phenyl moieties and Phe141, Tyr196, Leu265, Lys267, Tyr297 of the enzymatic binding pocket (Fig. 51\n). Three dimensional quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (3D-QSAR) and additional molecular docking studies on this class of compounds were performed to obtain informations for rational design of novel benzotriazoles endowed with more potent antiproliferative activity [219].",

Still, the introduction of a methylene (76\u201378e) or ethylene (76\u201378f) bridge between the aromatic ring and the piperazine nucleus led to an activity decrease due to steric and electronic effects, rather than hydrophobic effect.",

The experimental results showed that most of compounds possessed a high affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor, while none of them bore affinity for subtype 5-HT1D\u03b2. The bond to the 5-HT2A receptor was favored by groups Ph, 3-Cl-Ph or 4-Cl-Ph on the N-4 piperazine ring. Instead, about 5-HT1A receptor, the potency increased significantly when a substituent 2-CH3O-Ph was located at the N-4 piperazine ring. Finally, authors deduced that the different receptors binding affinity was due to the double effect of the R substituent and the type of carbon linker. These evidences were justified through a different modes of interaction between ligand and receptor, as postulated by Ismaiel et al. [156] The Caliendo's research group also compared the binding affinity and selectivity of derivatives for different receptor isoforms, expressing it as 5-HT2A/5-HT2C ratio. The best selectivity ratio was obtained when R was a Ph or a 4-Cl-Ph group. On the contrary, when R was a 2-CH3O-Ph group the derivative acted as a 5-HT1A antagonist [238].",

Later on, their antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated. The 3-acetyl-4-(1-benzotriazolyl)-5-(2-benzofuryl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)pyrazole (103a) stood out for its analgesic action, and SAR studies showed that the pyrazole nucleus was more effective than the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring. The results obtained in several animal models suggested that these derivatives exerted centrally and peripherally mediated antinociceptive properties. Almost all the prepared compounds also expressed anti-inflammatory activity, with a maximum for the 2-(5-acetyl-3-phenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylidene)-1-(2-benzofuryl)-2-(1-benzotriazolyl)-ethanone (104a). SAR analysis for 5-acetyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives demonstrates that such activity decreases with the modification on the phenyl side chain. Finally, studies on the mechanism of action showed that new compounds acted through a selective inhibition of COX-2 [262]. Anticonvulsant activity was checked for selected compounds. Similarly to reference drug valproic acid, derivatives (104a,b) were found to be active in subcutaneous metrazole (ScMet) test. However, only derivatives (103b) and (104c) were active in maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test similarly to the second reference compound phenytoin. None of them acted as the third reference compound carbamazepine, which was active both in MES and in ScMet tests [262]. Structures are depicted in Fig. 61\n.",

Benzotriazole helicase inhibitors represent an interesting class of drugs, and potent derivatives were identified during the course of random screening studies. Particularly, previously reported as CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBBt), and 5,6-dichloro-1-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl) benzotriazole (DRBt) displayed an antiviral activity, showing IC50 values of 20 and 1.5 \u03bcM, respectively [28]. (DRBt) and (TBBt) have been tested in four different HCV subgenomic replicon systems. Both of them resulted able to inhibit HCV replication (EC50\nDRBT = 10\u201353 \u03bcM, EC50\nTBBt = 40\u201365 \u03bcM) in a comparable way to the inhibition reported in the enzymatic essays, showing a property that has been detected only for a handful group of HCV inhibitors. Moreover, they were not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM [267]. Furthermore, N-alkyl derivatives of (TBBt) showed good inhibitory activity against HCV, WNV, and JEV NTPase/helicases, and less cytotoxicity [268]. The benzotriazole moiety relevance was finally demonstrated by replacing it with a benzimidazole in the 5,6-dichloro and 5,6-dibromo-1-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl) benzimidazole (DRB and DBRB), which was much less potent as HCV helicases inhibitors (Fig. 62\n).",

They demonstrated that a small hydrophobic alkyl moiety (methyl or ethyl) at TBBt position 2 could play a crucial role in the HCV NTPase/helicase inhibition. Finally, the introduction of a ribofuranosyl ring in both benzotriazole and tetrabromobenzotriazole improved the water solubility while led to an inhibitory activity decrease of the inhibitory activity against HCV and all the tested enzymes [28].",

Indeed, these compounds were protected by a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company patent [289], but a part of them were firstly disclosed by Pagani [247] and Paglietti [290], who found them to posses analgesic and antiarythmic activity. Lead compounds from this first series are depicted in Fig. 70\nas new RSV-inhibitors. Particularly, 2-(2-((2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazol-1/2-yl)methyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)-N,N-diethylethanamines (115\u2013116) stood out for their potent antiviral activity against both A and B RSV subtypes. A good cytotoxic profile was paired with EC50 values an order of magnitude lower than that of ribavirine (EC50 = 2.7, CC50 = 34 \u03bcM, data not shown) [291].",

There is an urgent need for new pharmaceuticals which have a broader spectrum of activity or act through novel mechanisms of action, i.e. to overcome the increasing incidence of microbial resistance observed for currently used drugs. Benzotriazoles are regarded as a promising class of bioactive heterocyclic compounds that exhibit a range of biological activities. Therefore, this nucleus appears a very interesting scaffold in the drug discovery and development processes. As proved in this paper, benzotriale is useful to wide develop SAR analysis on different classes of pharmacological agents.

However, despite the active, exhaustive and target based research on development of many compounds as antibacterial, antimycotic, antimycobacterial, potassium channels activators, etc. no molecule has made its way to the market and clinic. It can be probably due to lack of molecular targets knowledge through which most of those compounds exert their biological actions, but it can be also due to lack of a comprehensive compilation of various research reports in each activity capable of giving an insight into the SAR of the compounds. The present review, covering more than 310 references, is expected to provide a low-height flying bird's eye view of the benzotriazole derived compounds to a drug designer and medicinal chemist for a comprehensive and target oriented information for development of clinically viable molecules.",
