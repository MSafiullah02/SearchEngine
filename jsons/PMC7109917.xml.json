Most of the respiratory specimens tested were from hospitalized patients from the University of Minnesota Medical Center and the University of Minnesota Children\u2019s Hospital. Ordering guidelines stating that the assay was to be ordered only on hospitalized patients in respiratory distress and for the evaluation of severely immunocompromised or critically ill patients with respiratory symptoms were put in place to avoid misuse of the assay. The assay was discouraged in patients seen in the emergency department (ED) or in clinics, and respiratory viral cultures and/or rapid antigen tests for respiratory viruses were recommended as alternative testing. Despite this, some specimens were submitted from the ED and outpatient clinics per physician orders.",

Since the introduction of new technologies that have moved diagnosis abilities forward, the capability to detect more than one virus per specimen has greatly increased our understanding of the true incidence of viral coinfection. Viral codetection was seen in 72 (9.1%) of the 788 positive specimens in our study. HRV was the virus most commonly associated with other viruses. The clinical significance of such viral codetection and thus possible coinfection is unclear, and review of the literature is conflicting. Some studies link viral coinfection with more severe clinical outcomes, and some show no overall difference between single respiratory virus infection and viral coinfections.3,22\u201027 Also, as shown in our study (Table 3), viral codetection appeared to be more commonly seen in pediatric patients than in adults.24 The reasons for this difference are not known. Even though the impact of viral coinfection on severity of disease is unclear, the need for rapid and accurate detection of a wide spectrum of viral respiratory pathogens is desirable to understand their correlation with clinical illness and for epidemiologic and hospital infection control reasons.",
