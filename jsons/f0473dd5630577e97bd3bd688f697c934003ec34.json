To assess which step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle is affected 399 by suramin treatment, we performed a time-of-addition assay. We observed that pre-treatment with 400 suramin as well as addition during the first hour of infection resulted in a marked decrease of viral 401 RNA in the supernatant, while treatments initiated after the first hour of infection showed no 402 significant effect on virus replication, suggesting that suramin inhibits binding or entry. In addition, 403 SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was decreased in plaque assays, when suramin was present only in the 404 inoculum during infection, concordant with an effect on the early stages of infection (Fig. 3) . This is in 405 agreement with other studies that also reported on the inhibition of virus binding or entry by suramin 406 (15, 30, 34) .
