Its is clinically characterized by the sudden onset of excruciating pain in the involved site- usually the leg esp. if associated with abdominal involvement. The swelling is rapidly progressive, associated with purplish/bronze discoloration and blister formation- usually hemorrhagic. Involvement of underlying muscle is always more extensive than the evident skin involvement. The blister serosanguinous fluid will contain GPR, but inflammatory cells are infrequent [4]. Pathology: there is cell lysis and gas formation in connective tissue and muscle with minimal inflammation [4].The diagnosis of clostridial myonecrosis requires a high index of suspicion, since the infection spreads rapidly and death may occur within 24\u201348 h. Gram stain of a bulla allows for a timely diagnosis. Anaerobic cultures should be sent to determine appropriate antibiotic use. Imaging with X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan can demonstrate soft tissue gas (a late finding) and help determine the extent of infection [3].Spreading cellulitis with clostridial septicemia is a fulminant infection in neutropenic patients. A small area of purplish discoloration develops, often on the flank or abdominal wall. The lesion will expand rapidly over several hours, and more lesions appear in other areas. As it progresses, the lesions turn into brownish to blackish color with blister formation and crepitation. Clostridium can be captured in the fluid, but without inflammatory cells [4].Clostridium septicum has been associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis), which typically is a fulminant infection of the intestines in neutropenic patients [18].",

CMV disease is due to reactivation of latent virus following iatrogenic immunosuppression in organ transplantation, and cancer chemotherapy. Skin manifestations of CMV are rare in any setting, and very nonspecific (exanthematous, maculopapular, or morbilliform eruptions) and therefore diagnosis is often delayed. The cardinal manifestation of CMV infection in the skin is a chronic painful ulcer of the anal, perianal, or anogenital area. Although uncommon, oral manifestations of CMV infection have included painful erosions or ulcers of the tongue, buccal mucosa, and pharynx. Skin biopsy will confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating the characteristic large intranuclear inclusions with a surrounding halo, or \u201cowl\u2019s eye\u201d characteristic of CMV.

In patients with hematologic malignancies and stem-cell transplantation, non-albicans species predominate including C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis [32\u201336]. In solid tumors, approximately half of disseminated candidiasis is secondary to C. albicans [32]. The epidemiology of these infections is likely related to the choice of fungal prophylaxis and resistance patterns of non-albicans species [34]. The frequency of cutaneous manifestations in the setting of candidemia is reported to occur in 11\u201344% of cases [34]. The typical skin lesions are 5\u201310 mm pink papules, which rarely lead to eschar formation or skin necrosis. There are often numerous papules involving the trunk and proximal extremities [30]. Some lesions may be purpuric, especially if thrombocytopenia is also present [34]. Mortality associated with candidemia has been reported to be over 50%, therefore prompt recognition of skin lesions and initiation of empiric treatment is important [35]. Diagnostics can be challenging, positive blood cultures occur in less than 50% of the cases. It is important to consider obtaining tissue for histopathology and culture or using novel non-culture diagnostics. Histology typically shows fungal elements including pseudohyphae, hyphae and yeast within the dermis or blood vessels [34]. An echinocandin such as micafungin is recommended as empiric treatment in most patients [31] (Fig. 6).",

Cutaneous involvement can present as a localized infection by direct skin inoculation or via hematogenous dissemination. Blood cultures are typically negative in disseminated infection therefore it is recommended to obtain tissue biopsy with culture and histopathology. Skin manifestations are similar to Fusarium infections. Primary or localized lesions can present as cellulitis with focal erythema and swelling that can progress leading to the formation of bullae, necrotic ulcers and eschars. Invasive fungal sinusitis secondary to Aspergillus sp. can also extend to the skin leading to facial cellulitis; this is covered in further detail in the chapter about fungal infections. Disseminated infection typically presents as scattered erythematous papules or nodules [30, 41]. Histology will show septated narrow hyphae with 45\u00b0 branching and club-shaped pseudohyphae [43]. Treatment with triazoles such as voriconazole is the preferred anti-fungal unless there is a contraindication to this class and then liposomal amphotericin B would be recommended [44].",

Unlike other fungal infections, cutaneous mucormycosis most often occurs by direct inoculation rather than dissemination. Skin lesions may begin as a small erythematous macule but typically develop a black necrotic eschar with surrounding erythema and swelling. If there is concern for disseminated disease it is important to look for metastatic skin lesions [47]. Patients with rhinocerebral mucormycosis may present with orbital or facial cellulitis with a classic black necrotic eschar [45]. Obtaining tissue histopathology with culture is essential for diagnosis. Histologic examination will show broad non septate hyphae branching at 90\u00b0 [43].

SS can occur in the presence of an underlying malignancy such as AML, CML, MDS or myelofibrosis. It is also known to be drug-induced and can occur secondary to infections, classically it is described after an upper respiratory tract infection [60]. The skin lesions are often erythematous or violaceous papules, nodules or plaques which are tender. Vesicles or bullae can develop due to edema of the upper dermis [60]. A unique finding in SS is pathergy. Cutaneous findings may appear after trauma including venipuncture or biopsy [61]. Histopathology shows neutrophilic infiltrates of the dermal papillae without evidence of leukoclastic vasculitis. Unlike leukemia cutis, the neutrophils that infiltrate the dermis are typically mature [60, 62]. When considering SS it is important to rule out an underlying infection; an important differential diagnosis is pyoderma gangrenosum. Treatment of the underlying malignancy is necessary but steroids can also be utilized [63] (Fig. 11).",

It is typically a diagnosis of exclusion but is characterized by a rapidly developing, painful ulceration with undermined borders. Like Sweet\u2019s Syndrome it may exhibit pathergy [65]. The base of the ulcer is typically necrotic with a surrounding erythematous or violaceous halo [66]. The bullous subtype is characterized by bullae formation preceding the ulceration and is commonly associated with hematologic malignancies [58]. Skin biopsy from the border of the ulcer should be obtained although it is difficult to diagnose PG based on pathology due to changing histology with the evolution of the ulcer. Examination may reveal dense neutrophilic infiltrates with leukoclastic vasculitis or necrosis [67]. Treatment with steroids usually results in rapid improvement [66].",

SJS and TEN may begin with a prodrome which includes high fever. Skin findings may begin with erythematous macules or targetoid lesions progressing to the development of bullae and erosions [71]. Nikolsky sign is often positive. Many patients will also have mucosal involvement [72]. The two conditions are distinguished from each other based on body surface involvement; SJS involves <10% and TEN involves >30% with an overlap of disease characterization between 10\u201330% [71]. Many drugs have been linked to the development of SJS or TEN, particularly antibiotics. Sulfonamide antibiotics are most commonly associated with SJS or TEN however all antibiotics should be considered as an etiology [71, 73] (Figs. 12 and 13).\n",
