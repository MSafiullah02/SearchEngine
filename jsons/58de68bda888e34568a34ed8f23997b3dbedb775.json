During the past 50 y, tremendous advances in both clinical and basic sciences of zinc metabolism in humans have been observed. The major factor contributing to zinc deficiency is high phytate-containing cereal protein intake in the developing world, and nearly 2 billion subjects may be zinc deficient. Conditioned deficiency of zinc has been observed in patients with malabsorption syndrome, liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, and other chronic illnesses. Major clinical problems resulting from zinc deficiency in humans include growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. In the Middle East, zincdeficient dwarfs did not live beyond the age of 25 y, and they died because of intercurrent infections. In 1963, we knew of only 3 enzymes that required zinc for their activities, but now we know of >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors that are known to require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells, and intracellular free zinc in these cells participate in signaling events. Zinc has been very successfully used as a therapeutic modality for the management of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold and for the prevention of blindness in patients with age-related dry type of macular degeneration and is very effective in decreasing the incidence of infection in the elderly. Zinc not only modulates cell-mediated immunity but is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.",

In 1973, Barnes and Moynahan (19) reported a 2-y-old girl with severe acrodermatitis enteropathica who was being treated with diiodohydroxyquinolone and a lactose-deficient synthetic diet but was not showing any satisfactory response to this therapy. The serum zinc concentration was significantly decreased. They, therefore, administered oral zinc sulfate to correct this deficiency. Surprisingly, the skin lesions and gastrointestinal symptoms cleared after zinc supplementation. When zinc was inadvertently omitted from the child's regimen, the child suffered a relapse; however, she again completely responded to oral zinc therapy. The authors attributed zinc deficiency to the synthetic diet that the patient received. The authors, however, soon realized that zinc might have been fundamental to the pathogenesis of this rare inherited disorder and that the clinical improvement reflected correction of the zinc status in the patient. This original observation was quickly confirmed in other patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) throughout the world. The underlying pathogenesis of the zinc deficiency in these patients is due to malabsorption of zinc caused by a mutation in ZIP4, an intestinal zinc transporter (20) .",

The dermatologic manifestations of severe zinc deficiency in patients with AE include bullous pustular dermatitis of the extremities and oral, anal, and genital areas around the orifices, paronychia, and alopecia. Ophthalmic signs include blepharitis, conjunctivitis, photophobia, and corneal opacities. Neuropsychiatric signs include irritability, emotional instability, tremors, and occasional cerebellar ataxia. Weight loss, growth retardation, and male hypogonadism are also prominent clinical features. Congenital malformation of fetuses and infants born of pregnant women with AE has been commonly observed (22) . AE patients have an increased susceptibility to infections. Thymic hypoplasia, absence of germinal centers in lymph nodes, and plasmacytosis in the spleen are seen consistently. All T cell-mediated functional abnormalities are completely corrected with zinc supplementation. Abnormal chemotoxis is also corrected with zinc therapy in AE patients. The clinical course is downhill with failure to thrive and complicated by intercurrent bacterial, fungal, viral, and other opportunistic infections. Gastrointestinal disturbances are severe and include diarrhea, malabsorption, steatorrhea, and lactose intolerance. The disease, if unrecognized and untreated, is fatal. Zinc supplementation, however, results in complete recovery.",

LPS binds to Toll-like receptor 4 on DCs and initiates Myd88 and TRIF [a domain containing adapter-inducing interferon (IFN)-b]-mediated signaling (39) . TRIF-mediated signaling increases the ZnT (a solute carrier )-5 mRNA and decreases ZIP-6 mRNA, thus resulting in a decrease in the intracellular free zinc in DCs. Reduction in intracellular free zinc increases surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, which is important for the activation of CD4+ T cells (39, 40) .",

Zinc is involved in monocyte/macrophage development (41) (42) (43) and regulates its functions such as phagocytosis and proinflammatory cytokine production. LPS stimulation of zinc-sufficient monocytes results in downregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8 (37) (38) (39) . Zinc inhibits the membrane phosphodiesterase, leading to elevated levels of the second messenger guanosine 39,59 cyclic monophosphate, which is followed by a subsequent suppression of the nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)-dependent mRNA of TNF-a, IL-1b, and other inflammatory cytokines (40) (41) (42) . Additionally, zinc induces A-20, which inhibits NF-kB signaling via TNF receptorassociated factor pathways, resulting in downregulation of the mRNA of inflammatory cytokines (44) (45) (46) . Based on this, we propose that zinc is an important anti-inflammatory agent.",

The biochemical evidence of zinc deficiency in SCD patients was decreased levels of zinc in the plasma, erythrocytes, and hair; hyperzincuria; decreased activity of certain zincdependent enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase in erythrocytes, alkaline phosphatase in the neutrophils, deoxythymidine kinase activity in newly synthesizing skin connective tissue and collagen; and hyperammonemia (54, 55) .

Zinc supplementation in SCD patients resulted in significant improvement in secondary sexual characteristics, normalization of plasma ammonia level, and correction of dark adaptation abnormality. Zinc supplementation also increased zinc levels in plasma, erythrocytes, and neutrophils. The expected response to zinc supplementation in enzyme activities was also observed. Increased longitudinal growth and body weight in 14-to 18-yold SCD patients were observed.

First, zinc therapy must begin within 24 h of the onset of cold symptoms. Second, the total daily dose of elemental zinc should be >75 mg. Third, the chemical formulation should be optimal so that zinc is ionized in the oral cavity at pH 7.4. Zinc acetate and zinc gluconate are good salts to use; however, if citric acid, glycine, tartarate, and other binders are used, zinc is prevented from ionization. Thus, it is critical that the solution chemistry of the preparation is proper. Physicians and health practitioners must realize that one cannot treat common cold symptoms by swallowing zinc tablets, zinc syrup, or zinc lozenges. Zinc lozenges must be used orally and allowed to dissolve slowly in the mouth, which will then allow ionic zinc to be released, absorbed, and transported to the virally infected nose.",

The intestinal cells turnover rapidly and take the complexed copper into the stool for final excretion. Zinc not only blocks food copper but also the copper that is endogenously excreted via salivary, gastric, and other gastrointestinal juices. Thus, zinc is effective in producing a chronic negative copper balance. Fifty milligrams of elemental zinc (as acetate) is given orally 3 times a day for the management of Wilson's disease patients. Zinc is given in a fasting or postabsorptive state. The only side effect is that 10% of the subjects may have gastric discomfort.

Zinc is required for NF-kB DNA binding in purified or recombinant NF-kB p50 protein of the T helper cell line. Additional studies also showed that zinc decreased LPS-, ROS-, or TNF-a-induced NF-kB activation in endothelial cells and cancer cells (46) . We reported previously (44) that compared with controls, healthy volunteers who were supplemented with zinc (45 mg/d) had a significant decrease in TNF-a and IL-1b mRNA and TNF-a induced NF-kB DNA binding in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and zinc upregulated the expression of A-20 in HL-60 cells. In this study, we observed that zinc decreased oxLDL-induced generation of TNF-a, IL-1b, and VCAM-1, oxidative stress markers, and activation of NF-kB and increased A20 and PPAR-2 proteins in human monocytic and vascular endothelial cells. We propose that zinc inhibited NF-kB activation by inducing A20, a transactivating factor that played a role in reducing IL-1b-and TNF-a-induced NF-kB activation.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by many stimuli modifies LDL into oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in macrophages and vascular endothelial cells. oxLDL or ROS can activate the apoptotic pathway via activation of proapoptotic enzymes and the nuclear transcription factor kB (NF-kB) pathway via NF-kB inducible kinase (NIK) activation, which eventually results in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Zinc might have an atheroprotective function by the following mechanisms: 1) inhibition of ROS generation via metallothionein (MT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and inhibition of NADPH oxidase and 2) downregulation of atherosclerotic cytokines/ molecules such as inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), fibrinogen, and tissue factor (TF) through inhibition of NF-kB activation by A20-mediating TNF-receptor associated factor (TRAF) signaling and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPAR-a)-mediating crosstalk signaling.
