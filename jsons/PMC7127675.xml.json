            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease in humans. MS has prevalence rates between 50 and 100 per 100,000 Caucasians; other ethnic groups have somewhat lower prevalence rates and women are more afflicted than men by a 2:1 ratio (Kurtzke, 1997). The inflammatory demyelinating lesions characteristic of MS are limited to the central nervous system (CNS) (Dejong, 1970). In most instances, MS patients have oligoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)G bands in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and a mild mononuclear pleocytosis may also be present. Clinical features of the disease include vision loss, motor and sensory disturbances, and cognitive impairment. The clinical course of MS can include relapses and remissions and may be progressive in nature. MS has been proposed to be mediated by autoreactive CNS\u2010specific CD4+ T cells (Markovic\u2010Plese 2001, Noseworthy 2000). However, significant numbers of CD8+ T cells are found in MS lesions (Hayashi 1988, Sobel 1989) and are likely to be involved in pathogenesis.",

It is said to occur when peptides from viral (Fujinami et al., 1983) or bacterial (Zabriskie, 1986) proteins share sequence or structural similarities with self\u2010peptides. This similarity could stimulate autoreactive immune responses causing the production of self\u2010reactive antibodies. Fujinami, Oldstone, and colleagues (Fujinami 1985, Fujinami 1983) initially showed that a cross\u2010reactive epitope between the Hepatitis B virus polymerase and the encephalitogenic epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP) for the rabbit could induce an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)\u2010like disease when used as an immunogen. For EAE to occur, this cross\u2010reaction had to occur at the level of induction/activation of autoreactive CD4+ T cells. This was the first demonstration of autoimmune disease induced by a viral peptide (Fujinami and Oldstone, 1985).",

Additionally, peptide elution studies have found that MHC molecules can potentially bind hundreds of different peptides (Hunt et al., 1992). The work by Lang et al. (2002) suggested that molecular mimicry occurs rather frequently having shown that different peptides bound to class II molecules can lead to cross\u2010reactivity by the same TCR provided the complexes have similar charge distribution and overall shape. The flexibility of TCR recognition plays a major role in forming the T\u2010cell repertoire through thymic selection, and is highly important in protecting the host against potential pathogen\u2010derived antigens that are more wide ranging than the limited number of memory T cells (Casrouge et al., 2000). TCR degeneracy raises the potential for cross\u2010reactivity between pathogen\u2010derived and self\u2010antigens.",

            "text": "The Welsh and Selin laboratories have investigated molecular mimicry, or the sharing of immunologic cross\u2010reactive epitopes, between viruses, as opposed to between a pathogen and its host, using such viruses as Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Pichinde virus (PV), Vaccinia virus (VV), and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) (Brehm 2002, Chen 2001, Welsh 2000). They coined the term \u201cheterologous immunity\u201d to describe the protection provided by one infection against a different viral infection at a later time (Chen et al., 2001). This protection to the second infection was mediated by CD8+ T cells and the production of interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3 (Brehm et al., 2002). They also found that for CD8+ T cells, cross\u2010reactivity impacts T\u2010cell kinetics and the hierarchy of T cells responding to epitopes encoded by the infecting virus, which changes T\u2010cell responsiveness (Chen 2001, Selin 1998). Foreign proteins generally have several epitopes capable of being presented by MHC molecules; however, the cellular immune response is usually focused toward a narrow subset of these epitopes. This narrow response is known as immunodominance. When dominant epitopes have been deleted from a pathogenic organism, other epitopes emerge as dominant (Yewdell and Bennink, 1999). This phenomenon of immunodominance can be affected by prior infection with an organism encoding an epitope that generates T cells that cross\u2010react with a second pathogen (Brehm et al., 2002). The skewing of T\u2010cell immunodominance may be beneficial or harmful to the host. Additional examples of cross\u2010reactivity resulting in altered immune response include: primary infection with influenza virus followed by Epstein\u2010Barr virus (EBV), Human papillomavirus and Human coronavirus, and that which occurs between different strains of Dengue virus (Kim et al., 2005). For example, dengue virus serotypes encode subdominant epitopes that share sequence homology between them. When a host with prior immunity to one of these serotypes is infected with another viral serotype, the weakly shared epitope dominates the immune response resulting in better recognition of the first serotype. This is due to memory T cells specific for the shared epitope proliferating and expanding, giving the subdominant epitope a distinct advantage (Mongkolsapaya et al., 2003). Unfortunately, not all cases of heterologous immunity are as predictable. For instance, previous infection with LCMV has been shown to protect mice against VV infection resulting in reduced viral titers and a change in the T\u2010cell\u2010dependent pathology (Chen 2001, Selin 1998). In contrast, prior VV infection has little effect on LCMV immunity. It has been reported that VV infection of LCMV\u2010immune mice results in expansion of MHC class I\u2010restricted CD8+ T cells with different epitopes dominating the response (Chen 2001, Kim 2002, Kim 2005, Selin 1998). Following VV infection, LCMV\u2010immune mice had a reduction in the frequency of LCMV\u2010specific CD8+ T memory cells to some epitopes while others remained constant or increased (Kim et al., 2005).",

In support of this, a study by Rothwell et al. (1996) of patients with type\u20101 diabetes found that disease prevalence was higher in patients born in the spring and early summer than during the winter months. However, this hypothesis is still controversial as studies from Slovenia (Ursic\u2010Bratina et al., 2001) and Israel (Laron et al., 2005) had similar results with higher prevalence rates for type\u20101 diabetes in individuals born in the spring and early summer, but an analysis of data from Germany showed opposite results with fewer type\u20101 diabetes cases born between April and September (Neu et al., 2000).",

However, clinical and experimental research indicates that CD8+ T\u2010cell reactivity could be involved in the pathology of MS (Wekerle and Lassmann, 2005). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) could destroy oligodendrocytes leading to demyelination. In vitro experiments have shown that oligodendrocytes can be induced by IFN\u2010\u03b3 to express MHC class I antigen but not class II antigen (Grenier et al., 1989). In both MS and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, apoptosis of oligodendrocytes has been observed (Dowling 1997, Tsunoda 1996, Tsunoda 1999, Tsunoda 1997). TMEV belongs to the family Picornaviridae. Infection with TMEV causes an extensive demyelinating disease in the CNS of persistently infected mice (Tsunoda 1996, Tsunoda 1999). We monitored cytotoxic T\u2010cell responses in SJL/J mice, which are susceptible to TMEV\u2010induced demyelinating disease. We found that spleen cells and T\u2010cell clones from TMEV\u2010infected mice were highly cytotoxic to uninfected syngeneic cells, but not to allogeneic cells following stimulation with TMEV\u2010infected antigen\u2010presenting cells. These autoreactive cells were found to be CD3+CD8+ by flow cytometry and antibody\u2010blocking cytotoxicity assays (Tsunoda et al., 2005). Double chamber 51Cr release assays showed that direct cell\u2010to\u2010cell contact was required for lysis. It was also found that cell killing was mediated by the Fas\u2010FasL pathway (Tsunoda et al., 2002). Intracerebral adoptive transfer of activated TMEV\u2010induced autoreactive cells and T\u2010cell clones into naive mice resulted in degenerating lesions in the spinal cord, suggesting that these MHC class I\u2010restricted CD8+ T cells could play an effector role in CNS pathology in this model (Tsunoda et al., 2005). We went on to show that these CTLs could be efficiently induced by a recombinant VV encoding the TMEV viral capsid proteins (Tsunoda et al., 2006). We hypothesized that the autoreactive CTLs recognize TMEV capsid proteins that share molecular mimicry with CNS antigen. We are in the process of narrowing down the TMEV capsid epitope and characterizing the mouse CNS antigen that is the target of these CTLs.",

            "text": "Previous studies on memory CD8+ T cells suggested that these cells were a resting, nondividing population lying in wait until reexposure to the antigen that resulted in their initial differentiation (Jamieson and Ahmed, 1989). Other studies suggest that memory CD8+ T cells continuously undergo a low level of homeostatic division for a long period of time following antigen clearance (Kos 1993, Tough 1994, Zimmerman 1996). This homeostatic division can be augmented by type I IFN, interleukin (IL)\u201015, and IFN inducers such as poly (I:C) as well as viral infection (Tough 1996, Zhang 1998). One study used mice whose immune system had been reconstituted with labeled splenocytes from LCMV\u2010immune mice and examined the fate of these cells following poly (I:C) treatment or infection with LCMV, PV, and VV (Kim et al., 2002). Previous reports from this group indicated that LCMV\u2010immune mice were partially resistant to PV and VV and that LCMV\u2010immune splenocytes could provide resistance to both PV and VV following adoptive transfer into naive animals; however, this resistance was lost if CD8+ T cells were depleted (Selin et al., 1998). In the Kim et al. (2002) study, it was found that the heterologous viruses (PV and VV) had the capacity to induce several cycles of proliferative expansion of memory CD8+ T cells which altered the antigen hierarchy of T cells specific to earlier pathogens. LCMV infection resulted in a greater than 300\u2010fold increase in the number of CD8+ T cells with a majority of cells being LCMV specific. In contrast, poly (I:C) treatment only resulted in limited cell division without a net increase in cell number or changes in the hierarchy. This phenomenon is likely due to poly (I:C) induction of apoptosis, which offsets cell division (Kim et al., 2002). Therefore, it was concluded that memory cell division with a net increase in number is characteristic of antigen\u2010specific stimulation while division without an increase in cell number is a characteristic of cytokine\u2010induced bystander stimulation. Interestingly, it was also found that CTLs generated against either LCMV or PV were not capable of lysing cells infected with the heterologous virus, which indicated little cross\u2010reactivity between the viruses (Brehm et al., 2002). However, CTLs from PV\u2010infected LCMV\u2010immune mice were able to lyse cells infected with either virus (Selin et al., 1994). It was found that PV encodes a subdominant epitope that shares six of eight amino acids with an LCMV epitope (Brehm et al., 2002). The fate of memory cells was assessed following PV infection of mice reconstituted with LCMV\u2010immune cells (Kim et al., 2005). Results indicate heterologous infection caused an increase in the number of T cells specific for the subdominant PV epitope. In contrast, there were considerable differences between individual LCMV\u2010immune mice in terms of what epitope\u2010specific T cells were stimulated by VV infection. Even though these responses were unpredictable, patterns of epitope recognition did emerge, with three epitopes more likely to be dominant. These differences in epitope\u2010specific response are thought to be due to private specificities of the TCR repertoire generated in each mouse following random rearrangement of the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) TCR gene segments (Kim et al., 2005). Studies examining the composition, maintenance, and alteration of the T\u2010cell memory pool have important implications for MS, and may help to explain the low concordance rates seen in identical twins.",

            "text": "A novel transgenic mouse model was created by Oldstone and colleagues (Evans et al., 1996) to examine whether molecular mimicry to a protein expressed in the CNS could lead to autoimmune disease. In this model, mice were generated that express nucleoprotein (NP) or glycoprotein from LCMV under the control of the MBP promoter as self in oligodendrocytes (Evans et al., 1996). These mice were infected with the Armstrong strain of LCMV and monitored for clinical signs of disease. It was found that LCMV infected tissues in the periphery but not the CNS, and that a vigorous CD8+ CTL response cleared virus from all tissues by 7\u201314 days postinfection. At 3\u2010weeks postinfection, the transgenic mice had 150\u2013300 CD8+ T cells per sagittal section of brain while nontransgenic control mice had less than 30 lymphocytes per section. Perivascular cuffing was seen in the transgenic mice and lymphocytes were seen in the parenchyma, brain stem, and spinal cord. Interestingly, brains of the transgenic mice infected with LCMV were found to contain these elevated levels of CD8+ T\u2010cell infiltrates 1 year after infection. At 3\u2010months postinfection, a clustering of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was found predominately in the white matter of the CNS including the corpus callosum, internal capsule, fimbria hippocampus, brain stem, and spinal cord. Clinical signs, including ruffled fur, weight loss, and balance difficulties, were also evident in 75% of the transgenic mice at 3\u2010months postinfection. This study also investigated the effect of a second infection with LCMV or VV encoding the NP transgene on the transgenic mice 6 weeks after the initial LCMV infection. Stimulation of the memory response by these viruses resulted in enhanced pathology including an increase in the ratio of CD8+ to CD4+ T lymphocytes and a greater likelihood that these infiltrates would be localized to the white matter as shown by immunohistochemical staining (Evans et al., 1996). This enhanced disease pathology, characterized by demyelination and motor dysfunction, following secondary viral infection is similar to human CNS autoimmune diseases, and these results suggest that infection by a virus that shares immune determinants with a protein expressed in oligodendrocytes can induce a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS.",

            "text": "To further validate the role viruses may play in the induction of autoimmune disease, a molecular mimicry model utilizing an H\u20102Db\u2010restricted immunodominant epitope of LCMV, NP396\u2013404 was used to identify structurally homologous murine self\u2010proteins (Hudrisier et al., 2001). The MHC class I\u2010restricted CD8+ T\u2010cell response against the LCMV NP protein has been shown to be directed against this immunodominant NP396\u2013404 epitope. Typically in an LCMV\u2010infected mouse that has cleared the virus, there is activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells which stay at a high level throughout the animal's life despite the fact that there is no detectable virus or viral antigens. These CTLs represent a potential source of autoreactivity, especially if their cytolytic activity remains functional and intact. Six nonameric sequences from endogenous proteins which shared structural and functional homology with LCMV NP396\u2013404 were identified through a database search. Five of these peptides were shown to have high H\u20102Db\u2010binding affinity and shared the main TCR contact site with LCMV NP396\u2013404. Three of these five peptides also shared an auxiliary TCR contact residue and one of these, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor I302\u2013310, also shared a third residue with the LCMV peptide resulting in a marked functional similarity between the self and viral epitopes. Despite the presence of TCR contact residues, none of the epitopes identified were able to stimulate antiviral CTLs in cytotoxicity assays. However, these peptides did behave as antagonists of lysis by LCMV\u2010specific CTLs which indicated that they were capable of interacting with the TCR, though the affinity was relatively low. Low affinity recognition of self\u2010MHC promoted thymocyte survival, and cells cultured with peptides were maintained for more than 2 months, suggesting these epitopes were in fact low\u2010affinity molecular mimics. Importantly, these self\u2010peptides were shown to allow LCMV\u2010specific and potentially autoreactive CD8+ T cells to maintain their cytolytic function in the absence of viral antigens over a period of months (Hudrisier et al., 2001).",

Bacterial DNA was detected in 97% of these MS patients compared to only 18% of patients with other neurological diseases. They were also able to isolate C. pneumoniae from the CSF of MS patients in addition to identifying anti\u2010C. pneumoniae antibodies. This work inspired Lenz et al. (2001) to identify a protein from C. pneumoniae, Cnp0483, with similarity to MBP. Cnp0483, an MBP68\u201386 homologue peptide, was used to sensitize Lewis rats. Animals began showing signs of disease approximately 12\u2010days postsensitization. Pathologically, perivascular cuffing and mononuclear cell infiltrates were found in the spinal cords of Cpn0483\u2010immunized rats. Additionally, splenocytes from Cpn0483\u2010injected mice that had been cultured with peptide caused disease when they were transferred into naive animals. Interestingly, the Cpn0483 peptide shares only seven amino acids with MBP68\u201386.

They determined that this T\u2010cell clone, GP5F11, reacted with the immunodominant influenza hemagglutinin (Flu\u2010HA) epitope 306\u2013318. GP5F11 was found to be a high avidity pathogen\u2010specific T\u2010cell clone that had demonstrated cross\u2010reactivity against 14 Flu\u2010HA variants, 11 viral, 15 human, and 3 myelin\u2010derived peptides. Of the 11 viral mimics, it was found that equine influenza\u2010A HA peptide had greater than 70 times higher stimulatory potential than the human influenza peptide, suggesting that there is a high potential for cross\u2010recognition even for a T\u2010cell clone with a stringent (high avidity) TCR response.

This broad range of cross\u2010reactivity of a single TCR would assure protection against much more than the original infecting influenza virus with the potential side effect of autoimmune responses against self\u2010antigens having structural or sequence similarity to pathogenic peptides.",

The T\u2010cell clones used in this experiment were found to be expanded during exacerbations of MS and reduced during periods of remission. Biometric analysis was used to predict stimulatory peptides for the T\u2010cell clones and then peptides were selected from human infectious agents. Many peptides were identified using this method; however, following normalization only two related DNA viruses were selected. These viruses were TTV and TTV\u2010like mini virus, both of which are recognized as ubiquitous, nonpathogenic viruses in the human population. There were several stimulatory peptides identified from TTV, and surprisingly, the majority were mapped to a 74\u2010amino acid sequence in the N\u2010terminal region of open reading frame 1. This N\u2010terminal region is enriched in positively charged amino acids, mainly arginine. Other stimulatory peptides were also identified for the T\u2010cell clone from other human viruses, including adenovirus and papillomavirus. The adenovirus peptide was from the pVII protein which is enriched in arginine and performs a histone\u2010like function. The papillomavirus peptides were found in the minor capsid protein L2, which is enriched in basic amino acids. Human stimulatory peptides from the human CNS proteins adrenergic receptor \u03b1\u20101B, \u03b1\u20101A, and \u03b1\u20102C, arginine\u2010rich protein, and dopamine D2 receptor were also identified for the MN19 T\u2010cell clone. Interestingly, arginine\u2010rich domains are frequent in viruses as well as eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Sospedra et al., 2005). This recognition of an arginine\u2010enriched conserved domain may be involved in inducing and perpetuating autoimmune responses against arginine\u2010rich self\u2010antigens.",

EBV is a large DNA virus that causes mononucleosis in humans and has been shown to persist in B cells. Infection with EBV late in life has been correlated with an increased risk of developing MS. Lang et al. (2002) used a CD4+ T\u2010cell clone isolated from an MS patient with a relapsing\u2010remitting disease course to examine the TCR contact surfaces of a cross\u2010reactive TCR that recognizes both the MBP85\u201399 peptide and an EBV DNA polymerase peptide (EBV627\u2013641). They found that MBP85\u201399 was recognized in the context of DRB1*1501 and EBV627\u2013641 was recognized in the context of DRB5*0101 based on relative binding affinities (Lang et al., 2002). DRB1*1501, DRB5*0101, as well as DQB1*0602 are MHC class II alleles of the DR2 haplotype that have been shown to be risk factors for MS. Transgenic mouse studies determined that spleen cells from TCR\u2010DRB1*1501 double\u2010transgenic mice only responded in the form of proliferation and cytokine production to the MBP85\u201399 peptide, while spleen cells from TCR\u2010DRB5*0101 double\u2010transgenic mice only responded to the EBV627\u2013641 peptide. Spleen cells from triple\u2010transgenic mice with TCR\u2010DRB1*1501\u2010DRB5*0101 responded to both the MBP85\u201399 and EBV627\u2013641 peptides. These transgenic mice recognized the MBP and EBV peptides in the context of two different MHC class II molecules. Next, the crystal structures of both of these MHC\u2010peptide complexes were determined and compared. It was found that the TCR contact surfaces of the DRB5*0101\u2010EBV627\u2013641 and DRB1*1501\u2010MBP85\u201399 complexes were structurally very similar. The nature of MHC class II binding to peptide, with the peptide chain held in a highly conserved extended conformation, is thought to allow for structural mimicry in TCR recognition (Lang et al., 2002).",

The virus has a tropism for CD4+ T cells and can reactivate from its latent state following immunosuppression (Braun 1997, Salahuddin 1986). Challoner et al. (1995) found that oligodendrocytes from MS patients expressed HHV\u20106 virion proteins. A protein found in both the A and B variants of HHV\u20106, known as U24, has amino acid sequence similarity with MBP. Two 13\u2010mer peptides corresponding to residues 1\u201313 of the HHV\u20106 U24 protein and MBP93\u2013105 were synthesized and used to determine whether T cells would cross\u2010react with the two peptides or were specific for only one of the sequences (Tejada\u2010Simon et al., 2003). T\u2010cell cultures from PBMCs of MS patients were incubated with MBP93\u2013105 or HHV\u20106 U241\u201313 for 1 week, tested for specificity, and characterized as MBP or HHV\u20106 reactive or cross\u2010reactive.

The peptides in these libraries are referred to as mimotopes because it is not required for them to have sequence similarity, but rather they mimic binding properties or conformation of natural epitopes. There have been reports of mimotopes from RPL selection that were recognized by antibodies from the CSF of MS patients (Cortese 1996, Cortese 1998, Dybwad 1997). Interestingly, some of these antibodies were detected in sera from normal individuals as well as MS patients, suggesting that the mimotopes mimic common antigens (Cortese et al., 2001). One mimotope family, MS17, was chosen because of its reactivity with CSF antibodies and high frequency of reactivity with the sera of MS patients. Two CSF samples from MS patients that recognize MS17 were tested for reactivity in an enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to neurotropic viruses, including EBV, measles, mumps, rubella, HSV\u20101, and cytomegalovirus (Cortese et al., 2001). Both CSF samples tested positive against measles and HSV\u20101; however, only the reactivity to HSV\u20101 was competitively inhibited by MS17 phage. In addition, whole cell extract from an HSV\u20101\u2010infected cell line preincubated with CSF from the MS patients completely abolished recognition of the phage (Cortese et al., 2001). A consensus sequence profile was then derived from multiple alignments of all HSV\u20101 isolates, and this was used to search for homology between eight members of the MS17 family and HSV\u20101 protein sequences. The highest score from this profile came from the N\u2010terminal region of the HSV\u20101 envelope glycoprotein B (gB). The MS17 mimotope corresponds to the sequence of HSV\u20101 gB between amino acid positions 474\u2013482. Antibodies against MS17 were raised in rabbits, and extensive characterization of these antibodies demonstrated that the MS17 phage is both an antigenic and immunogenic mimic of the HSV\u20101 gB epitope. Using the anti\u2010MS17 antibodies in place of the CSF samples, the antibodies were found to specifically interact with an as yet uncharacterized protein present in protein extract from the brain of an MS patient (Cortese et al., 2001). These studies represent an important step in identification of the natural antigens that antibodies from MS patients recognize as well as providing an example of molecular mimicry between a viral and CNS epitope that is mediated through antibody. The RPL technique has the potential to aid in explaining the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.",

Studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies generated against viral proteins from measles, HSV\u20101, and VV react with host cell components (Dales 1983, Fujinami 1983); common determinants existed between viruses and cellular\u2010 or tissue\u2010specific elements (Srinivasappa et al., 1986). In another report, a monoclonal antibody, H8, to the TMEV Daniels (DA) strain reacted with both TMEV viral protein\u20101 and lipid\u2010like moieties including galactocerebroside, a major component of myelin (Fujinami et al., 1988). In mouse brain cultures, cells that bound the TMEV monoclonal antibody, H8, were also labeled with antibody to MBP (Yamada et al., 1990). This double staining indicated that the H8 antibody recognized epitopes on oligodendrocytes. When the antibody was injected into mice with EAE, H8 caused an increase in the area of demyelination within spinal cords. Furthermore, a competition ELISA for galactocerebroside and TMEV found that sera from mice contained antibody with the same specificity as H8. These results indicate that the immune response which generates antibodies specific for TMEV that cross\u2010react with myelin and oligodendrocytes could contribute to demyelination through an antibody\u2010mediated process (Yamada et al., 1990).",

Molecular mimicry has been found in antibodies that cross\u2010react with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1), a protein found in CNS neurons, and the HTLV\u20101 tax protein. Two core epitopes within the C\u2010terminal region of hnRNP A1, both functionally important regions, were found to react with antibodies purified from HAM/TSP patients. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies raised against HTLV\u20101 tax protein also reacted with the two core epitopes from hnRNP A1 (Lee et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Potentially, infection with viruses that have molecular mimicry with CNS antigens can prime autoreactive immune cells specific for the CNS in hosts. Our laboratory has explored whether a virus having molecular mimicry with self\u2010CNS antigens could induce an autoimmune disease in mice which had previously been inducible only by injection of CNS antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (Theil et al., 2001). Three recombinant VVs were constructed: encoding myelin proteolipid protein (VVPLP), encoding myelin\u2010associated glycoprotein (VVMAG), and encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein (VVGFAP). Mice infected with VVPLP, VVMAG, or VVGFAP showed no clinical or histological signs of CNS disease. This suggests that molecular mimicry alone cannot result in high enough numbers or activation of CNS\u2010specific autoimmune cells for induction of CNS disease. Thus, 5 weeks after the first infection, when VV was cleared, we challenged mice nonspecifically with CFA to activate CNS\u2010specific autoimmune cells (bystander activation). Clinically, some mice showed paralysis in the tail, similar to EAE, following the CFA challenge. At 1\u2010month post\u2010CFA challenge, mice were sacrificed and CNS tissues were examined for pathological changes. All mice (15/15) were found to have inflammatory lesions with CD3+ T cells in the CNS (Theil et al., 2001). As a negative control, mice were infected with VVSC11, a recombinant VV that encodes \u03b2\u2010galactosidase, which has no known molecular mimicry with CNS antigens; following CFA challenge, no inflammatory changes were seen in the CNS (Theil et al., 2001). These data indicate that infections with viruses encoding molecular mimics can substantially prime animals for autoimmune disease and at a later time a nonspecific immunologic challenge could initiate the disease.",

Therefore, we have tested whether VVPLP\u2010sensitized mice developed clinical disease following a second, unrelated viral challenge with MCMV. Preliminary findings suggest this to be the case. Five out of nine mice primed with VVPLP and challenged with MCMV were found to have meningitis and perivascular cuffing in the CNS. In contrast, mice primed with VVPLP and challenged with the wild\u2010type strain of VV were found to have no obvious lesions. In another experiment, mice primed with VVPLP and challenged with MCMV showed marked weight loss and had righting reflex disturbances, compared with mice injected with phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) or VVSC11 followed by MCMV challenge (Ikuo Tsunoda, Jane E. Libbey, and Robert S.Fujinami, unpublished data). Thus far, the definitive experiments to determine whether disease in this model is caused by MHC class I or class II cells have not been completed.
