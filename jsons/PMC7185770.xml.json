Although the majority of work in patient safety to date has focused on adult and inpatient care, there is growing awareness that ambulatory care is as paramount as inpatient care given the large volume of ambulatory care received by children. In this article, we will lay the groundwork for a patient safety research agenda for pediatric ambulatory care. In taking this first step, we will rely on and present an overview of patient safety in general, discuss issues related to pediatric patient safety, present an overview of what is known regarding ambulatory patient safety based on a systematic literature review, and finally present a framework for improving pediatric patient safety in the ambulatory setting relying on frameworks developed in other clinically relevant areas.",

The intent of this model and its applicability to patient safety efforts lies in the fact that the field of medicine does not come from a tradition of openly discussing and collecting information on safety events. This leaves present-day groundswells to improve patient safety subject to a trap of \u201cnot being able to fix what one does not know is broken.\u201d The epidemic notion, therefore, looks at errors not as a new phenomenon, like severe acute respiratory syndrome, but instead an \u201capparent\u201d new phenomenon based on the fact that the field of medicine is just coming on board with the idea of systematic reporting and collecting of error event data. Logistically this epidemic model and the relative paucity of information and research on medical errors lend themselves to an overarching long-term plan for safety solutions that follows the traditional stages of action for epidemic response as shown the Figure\n.6 This model helps prioritize among the list of research agenda topics developed at the national summit. As we develop a specific agenda for patient safety for pediatric ambulatory care, we will refer back to this overarching epidemic model given the universality of its applicability.",

To those health care providers immersed in children's health care, the rationale behind the need for targeted pediatric patient safety research is readily apparent. Children are unique in many ways related to the four Ds: developmental change, dependency on adults, different disease epidemiology, and demographic characteristics.10 Examples of how this plays out for children include the unique situation of weight-based dosing, compared with adults, whereby children can be subject to 10- to 100-fold dosing errors since children actually can come in size ranges from 300 grams to over 300 pounds, and the unique medical events such as birth.11, 12 In addition, children's health care providers are frequently separate in training and both divisional and departmental academic homes from health care providers for adults. Because both patient and provider factors combine in patient safety events, it is critical to understand how the obvious differences in pediatric patients and pediatric providers interplay with patient safety.",

Consistent with the IOM report To Err Is Human, patient safety in this article is defined as freedom from accidental injury because of medical care, which translates to medical errors. Such medical errors can be further defined using the definition from the federal response to To Err Is Human outlined in the report entitled Doing What Counts, as \u201cthe failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or of use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim. Errors can include problems in practice, products, procedures, and systems.\u201d1, 13 This definition excludes acts that did not achieve their desired outcomes (as long as that was not the result of negligence), outcomes caused by the intrinsic properties of the underlying illness or additional patient comorbidities, and outcomes known to be risks of specific procedures. Inherent in this definition is the idea that the causes of the vast majority of patient safety events are not sole individuals but instead are embedded in the organizations, processes, and systems within which individuals receive care. Perhaps more so than inpatient care, ambulatory care and the resultant patient safety issues depend heavily on patients, families, providers, and organizations, and how these interact. This definition of patient safety applies broadly to all ages.",

This translates to encounters that need substantial communication and coordination, with many hand offs and transitions. The ultimate management of ambulatory care is often difficult for patients and families, not to mention that ambulatory practices often have not kept up with the rapid development of medical science and diagnostic, therapeutic, and technologic capabilities.9\n",

For example, several thought-piece articles have been recently published talking about the broad picture of quality and safety in emergency departments in general, for children with special health care needs, and for medicine management in primary care.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 Taking random examples of articles one can find but not by systematic searches looking for medical errors, there are pieces that discuss the issues around conscious sedation for dentistry, examples of deaths from lipoplasty, concerns about diagnostic accuracy of pediatric echocardiograms performed in adult laboratories, and research on safe pediatric outpatient sedation.31, 32, 33, 34, 35 Likewise, the substantial body of literature on appropriate therapy and diagnosis of otitis media could also be considered a patient safety concern. Given that many articles like these do not specifically use terms such as medical errors or patient safety, a systematic identification and synthesis of these is not realistically feasible as we try to establish a research agenda for pediatric ambulatory care. Perhaps best known to most pediatricians is the wealth of information on immunizations. The clear take-home message from this body of work is that one cannot rely on vigilance and memory alone to ensure high quality care. As one recent review highlights, simplification with reminder systems and use of electronic information has been able to dramatically improve appropriate and maximal use of immunizations.36 Although it is easy to speculate on the lessons learned here and how they can apply to broader safety issues beyond immunizations, the reality is that this leap to global issues of safety in ambulatory care is not well examined in the literature.",

For example, one recent work on adult ambulatory patients suggests that medication errors are common. Because the rates of inpatient medication among adults and children are similar and alarmingly high, the high rates of medication errors in adult ambulatory patients should raise concern among pediatricians.11, 38, 39 In a recent study of Medicare enrollees,40 the overall rate of adverse drug events in adult ambulatory patients was 50/1000 person-years, with 14/1000 person-years considered preventable. Moreover, 38% of the adverse drug events were considered serious, life threatening, or fatal. These data highlight the need for similar studies in pediatrics. Although not in the peer-reviewed literature, recent efforts by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices have led to a new monthly publication to share lessons learned in medication safety for outpatient settings.41\n",

Although this pool of literature is larger, it is still relatively scarce for broad perspectives on inpatient errors as opposed to condition-specific inpatient errors. Recent work has shown us that children in inpatient settings experience high rates of medication errors because of all the unique vulnerabilities of children, compared with adults.11, 38 This more than likely is applicable to pediatric ambulatory care because of the high rate of medication prescribing in ambulatory settings. At least 2 studies are currently underway to examine the prevalence of ambulatory medication errors for children.42, 43 Beyond medication errors, several recent studies highlight the fact that children do experience other inpatient errors and that the rates are unacceptably high.44, 45 If nothing else, these studies compel us to proactively tackle patient safety in pediatric ambulatory care because it is most likely that these findings also hold true in this setting of care. Perhaps most poignantly in terms of inpatient care for children was the recent experience involving heart surgery on children at the Bristol Royal Infirmary between 1984 and 1995.46 A recent summary document on this experience47 details how to take the lessons learned and turn them into the reality of safer patient care by vital activities such as actively involving patients in their own care, a lesson clearly applicable to ambulatory care.",

These 3 steps involve first understanding the basics about the environment in which the epidemic is taking place (knowing the culture of safety in ambulatory care); second, identifying the prevalence of the epidemic (knowing the magnitude, risks, and types of errors seen in ambulatory care); and last, identifying strategies to curb the spread of the epidemic (knowing successful solutions to remedy safety concerns). As the literature review and the other broader research agendas attest, the bulk of work to date has been primarily focused on the most straightforward of these tiers to examine, namely the identification of the magnitude, risks, and types of errors seen.",

Any efforts to change practice will need the support of the providers and patients who will be much more likely to be actively involved and ensure success if they believe true and lasting improvements will result. Flowing directly from this is a need to be able to measure the culture and strategies to improve the culture. There is a growing literature base on how to assess and change an organization's safety culture.53, 54, 55, 56 This pool of literature has several common and recurrent themes: understanding of errors as systems problems, open and full reporting of all safety events, analysis of near-miss safety events, employee education on patient safety, and management tools to promote safety. It is likely very safe to say that these issues are universal for both care of adults and children. Different medical disciplines have their own cultures and acceptable behavior. How do providers trained to take care of children stand with respect to other peers in terms of awareness, acknowledgment, and acceptance of the reality of medical errors? Where do they stand in terms of ability and success at instituting changes meant to improve safety and their ability to critically evaluate these changes? Each ambulatory care setting brings with it a unique niche in which to date little is known about how patient safety factors into everyday discussions and care practices.",

To collectively think about and remedy medical errors, all providers need to understand basic definitions of errors and models for the analysis of errors in hopes of inducing systems changes. For example, providers need to be aware of decision-making processes that predispose one to errors such as concepts of sensitivity and specificity of tests, evidence-based medicine or a lack thereof, and the notion of inherent cognitive biases in care such as anchoring and prevalence bias. Comparably, we know little in terms of how working conditions affect ambulatory care in arenas such as sleep deprivation, visit time constraints, and patient-provider and provider-provider feedback and exchanges both proximal and distal to actual face-to-face visits to ambulatory care.",

Although the literature is not brimming with proven strategies in ambulatory care, substantial work does exist when one looks more broadly to other health care settings for guidance. Perhaps the largest synthesis of these solutions came from AHRQ as the evidence report entitled Making Health Care Safer: A Critical Analysis of Patient Safety Practices.58 Although the primary focus of this work related to in-hospital care, it is likely that some successful strategies from the inpatient arena will translate to outpatient care. It is also important to point out that little of this evidence comes from studies involving children and their health care providers. Although this coupled with the paucity of proven solutions in ambulatory care clearly is a significant gap and hurdle to improving safety in pediatric ambulatory care, some types of safety solutions are very likely to be generically applicable regardless of clinical setting or population. One of the most studied interventions that are likely to be generically applicable involve use of information technology. The research world is quickly accruing studies showing the benefits of information technology. For example, several evaluations of e-prescribing work have found that it creates substantial savings because of increased efficiency ($1.15 per practice member per month in pharmacy costs, $12 000 in practice savings per year because of increased operational efficiency, 30% reduction in physician to pharmacy phone calls, 1 h/d of pharmacists' time).",

This broad arena of solutions is the future of patient safety as we move to stage 2 of the epidemic. Given all the public and private focus on safety, institutions and systems are rampantly testing a wide range of solutions from low tech, no cost to high tech, high cost as the recent AHRQ report highlights. The difficulty here, however, is that many safety practices are never studied in the classical rigor of research and never published. This likely applies to both low-tech, low-cost interventions and interventions so obvious that one need not study them. Although at an institutional or health care system level this may be acceptable, this publication bias enormously hinders widespread dissemination and adoption of good safety practices. These issues are best captured in the summary document of the AHRQ report stating that \u201cthere are a number of methodologic reasons why research in patient safety is particularly challenging\u201d:\n\u2022Many practices (eg, the presence of computerized physician order entry systems, modifying nurse staffing levels) cannot be the subject of double-blind studies because their use is evident to the participants.Capturing all relevant outcomes, including near misses (such as a nurse catching an excessive dosage of a drug just before it is administered to a patient) and actual harm, is often very difficult.Many effective practices are multidimensional, and sorting out precisely which part of an intervention works is often quite challenging.Many of the patient safety problems that generate the most concern (wrong-site surgery, for example) are uncommon enough that demonstrating the success of a safety practice in a statistically meaningful manner with respect to outcomes is all but impossible.Establishing firm epidemiologic links between presumed (and accepted) causes and adverse events is critical and frequently difficult. For instance, in studying an intuitively plausible risk factor for errors, such as fatigue, analyses of errors commonly reveal the presence of fatigued providers (because many health care providers work long hours, late night hours, or both). The question is whether fatigue is overrepresented among situations that lead to errors. The point is not that the problem of long work hours should be ignored but rather that strong epidemiologic methods need to be applied before concluding that an intuitive cause of errors is, in fact, causal.58\n\n",

These solutions include ideas such as aviation-style preoperative checklists, crew resource management, and the use of simulators in training.
