Apparent clinical success is limited to a 200 few case reports and small series[13]. 201 Most of the drug options come from experience treating SARS, MERS or some 202 other new influenza virus previously[2,14], The combination of Arbidol and other 203 antiviral drugs, such as interferon, is currently a recommended antivirus regimen in 204 the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by 2019-nCoV (version 5) issued 205 by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China[10].While benefit 206 of Arbidol was suggested by preclinical studies. Arbidol is a synthetic antiviral drug to combat seasonal infuenza virus[15].Arbidol has been shown to inhibit viruses from 208 many diferent families[16], Arbidol were shown to have antiviral effect in early viral 209 replication in vitro for SARS-CoV[17], Arbidol have been found to be effective for 210 COVID-19 in vitro[18], previous studies reported that a combination of Arbidol and 211 LPV/r achieved further therapeutic effect than LPV/r only [19]. 212 Because Arbidol can induce interferon and immune cells, we hypothesized that 213 Arbidol combined with interferon has synergistic therapeutic effect in against 214 coronavirus. To test our hypothesis, we conducted this observational study. Our 215 retrospective multicenter cohort study analysis 141 general type patients[11] without 216 invasive ventilation, treated with Arbidol/IFN-\u03b12b, or IFN-\u03b12b.
