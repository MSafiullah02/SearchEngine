Design: a prospective, non-interventional, purely serologically based diagnostic study. Setting: a tertiary university hospital in southern Israel. Subjects: 133 elderly patients hospitalised for non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections. Methods: paired sera were obtained for each of the hospitalisations and were tested using immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassay methods to identify 13 different pathogens. Only significant changes in antibody titers or levels between the paired sera were considered diagnostic. Results: at least one infectious aetiology was identified in 77 patients (58%). At least one of seven viral aetiologies was identified in 52 patients (39%). A bacterial aetiology was identified in 27 patients (20%) including Streptococcus pneumoniae in 24 (18%). An atypical bacterium was found in 27 patients (20%) including Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 15 (11%) and Legionella spp. in nine (7%). More than one aetiology was found in 23 patients (17%). One hundred and twenty nine patients (96%) suffered from serious chronic co-morbidity. One hundred and twenty one patients received antibiotics during their hospitalisation, 106 (80%) with a beta-lactam and 42 (31%) with another antibiotic. Conclusions: non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infection is caused in hospitalised elderly patients by a broad spectrum of aetiological agents, primarily respiratory viruses with a significant, though lesser, prevalence of classical and atypical bacteria. Despite this distribution of aetiologies, most patients are treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. The indication for antibiotic therapy in these patients and the choice of antibiotic preparation should be addressed in further studies.",

            "text": "Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is very common in all age groups, especially in winter, and is usually treated in the primary care setting. This diagnostic category includes two principal diagnoses that have a different clinical and therapeutic significance. The more serious of the two is community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which necessitates hospitalisation for a minority of younger patients and many elderly patients [1] . The second is non-pneumonic LRTI, which is much more common than CAP but has a much more benign clinical course. Hospitalisation is rarely required for younger patients with this disease. However, non-pneumonic LRTI can cause a severe disease requiring hospitalisation in the elderly population. Although hospitalisation for this acute disease is not uncommon among elderly patients, we did not find a single article on this subject in a comprehensive literature search. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify the infectious aetiologies of non-pneumonic LRTI in hospitalised elderly patients, and to characterise the patients in terms of demographic, clinical and therapeutic variables.",

            "text": "The study consisted of 144 elderly patients hospitalised for non-pneumonic LRTI during the study period who met the inclusion criteria and gave their informed consent to participate. Since the aetiological diagnoses in this study were based on changes in antibody titre between the acute phase serum and the convalescence serum, we did not include in the data analyses four patients who died during the course of their hospitalisation and four patients from whom convalescence serum was not obtained. Convalescence sera were obtained from the 136 patients at a mean of 28.0\"4.9 (mean\"SD) days (range 21-39 days) after the first sample was drawn at admission to the hospital. Three additional patients were excluded from the data analyses because we found a polyclonal response to all of the pathogens tested. In all, 133 patients were included in the final data analysis. Table 1 presents the age and gender distributions of the study population together with data on hospitalisation rates in the previous year, current and past smoking habits, and immunisation rates for influenza and pneumococcus. Chronic co-morbidity is shown in the Table by type of illness. At least one serious chronic disease was found in 96% of the patients. The decision to hospitalise patients stemmed, in most cases, from a loss of control of the chronic disease due to the nonpneumonic LRTI, or because of the presence of the chronic disease per se. In addition to the LRTI symptoms that served as inclusion criteria, 30 patients (23%) had classic symptoms of URTI such as running nose, and/or sore throat, and/or hoarseness. During the course of hospitalisation patients had temperatures above 37.88C for a mean of 2.1\"1.1 days. Table 2 details the frequency and types of antibiotic therapy prior to and during hospitalisation and recommendations for treatment after discharge from the hospital. The low rate of antibiotic therapy prior to hospitalisation is striking in comparison to the high percentage of patients who received antibiotics in the hospital, particularly beta-lactam agents, most by the i.v. route. Table 3 presents the frequency distribution of the various infectious aetiologies identified for the 133 patients in accordance with the results of serological testing for the 13 respiratory pathogens. In 77 patients (58%) at least one infectious aetiology was identified, while in the other 56 (42%) no infectious aetiology was diagnosed. In 52 patients (39%) at least one of the seven respiratory viruses was found. In 27 patients (20%) at least one of the three bacteria was identified: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis. In 27 patients (20%) at least one of the following three atypical bacteria was identified: M. pneumoniae, Legionella spp. and C. pneumoniae. In the nine patients in whom Legionella spp. was found, the distribution of serogroups was: L. pneumophila 1 in none, L. pneumophila other than 1 in 6, and Legionella non-pneumophila in three patients. In 54 patients (41%) a single aetiology was identified, while in 15 patients (11%) and eight patients (6%), two and three infectious aetiologies were found, respectively.

We were very aware of the theoretical possibility that the antibody response upon which the diagnoses were based could be non-specific. In order to minimise this problematic possibility we diagnosed acute infection with a specific pathogen only in the presence of a significant change in the antibody titre or level between the paired sera in one of the specific immunoglobulins. This strategy increased our confidence that the identified pathogen was indeed the aetiological cause of the RTI, but at the same time it reduced the sensitivity of the tests and is responsible, at least in part, for the unknown aetiology in 42% of the patients in this study. Diagnosis by serology was preferred over the possibility of isolating pathogens from respiratory secretions. The isolation method suffers, for some of the pathogens, from low sensitivity and even when a pathogen is isolated from the secretion, an incidental contamination cannot be ruled out. In contrast, a change in antibody titre for a specific pathogen between paired sera usually indicates a significant association between that pathogen and the host, with a high probability that the association between the pathogen and the disease is causative.",

Despite the apparent similarity between that study and the present one, it is important to note that the previous study involved nonhospitalised elderly patients in the community and included patients with CAP. The pneumococcal aetiology was diagnosed in that study by the presence of the bacterium or its antigen in sputum, in contrast to the present study in which we purposely avoided this approach, as discussed above. The spectrum of aetiologies that was tested in that study did not include most of the Legionella spp. and the diagnostic methods for viruses and atypical pathogens were much less sensitive than those used in the present study.

This decision stemmed from the consideration that elderly COPD patients comprise a unique population in terms of level of risk and frequency of respiratory tract infections. Thus, it was reasonable to assume that the frequency distribution of infectious aetiologies for acute exacerbations in this population would not necessarily be similar to LRTI in elderly patients without COPD. This assumption was confirmed in another study of ours that was published recently, which specifically evaluated the frequency distribution of infections aetiologies in acute exacerbations of COPD [6] . A comparison of the results of these two studies reveals a degree of similarity between the frequency distributions of infectious aetiologies in the two populations, but not an identity. The frequency distribution for LRTI found in our study points to a clear dominance of viral aetiologies that were identified in 40% of the patients, and close to half of this rate for each of the other two groups of classic bacteria and atypical pathogens. The distribution is different from those quoted in the literature, namely that 'acute bronchitis is caused frequently by viruses, less commonly by M. pneumoniae and rarely by bacterial pathogens, namely Legionella spp. and Bordetella pertussis' [7, 8] . We believe that the difference between those versions and the results of the present study stems from the fact that we studied elderly hospitalised patients in contrast with the broad spectrum of community patients studied in the papers referred to above. The studies also differ in the diagnostic techniques used for the identification of the various pathogens, as discussed above.",

This percentage is low in both absolute and relative terms to the rate of infections with this pathogen reported in a previous study [9] . The reason for this low rate of C. pneumoniae infections in the present study is that we diagnosed acute infection with this pathogen only in the presence of a significant increase in antibody titre between the paired sera. This contrasts with earlier studies in which high antibody titers were considered diagnostic of acute infection even without change between paired sera. Today, high IgG and IgA titers for C. pneumoniae that did not change between acute and convalescence phase sera are viewed as evidence of chronic infection with this pathogen, at least in COPD patients [10] . Thus, patients with these titers were not diagnosed as acutely infected with this pathogen in the present study. If we had analysed the data using those criteria we would have identified 31 patients (23%) as serologically positive for acute C. pneumoniae infection.",

The principal reason for these differences between the present and previous studies is the number and type of specific serogroups included under the heading Legionella spp. In the vast majority of previous studies only L. pneumophila was identified, and in most cases only L. pneumophila 1. This serogroup of Legionella causes severe illness in a large percentage of infected patients that involves the lung parenchyma and is responsible apparently for reports of CAP that necessitates hospitalisation in intensive care units [11, 12] . In contrast, in the present study we tested 40 other serogroups of Legionella spp. in addition to L. pneumophila 1. In all nine patients there was a significant antibody response to Legionella spp. of serogroups other than L. pneumophila 1. The disease caused by these pathogens is usually relatively mild and it is not surprising that patients with these pathogens did not have radiologic evidence of CAP and their disease course was relatively benign.",

The prevalence rates of LRTI with positive serology for these bacteria in the present study were relatively low. This finding contrasts strongly in particular with the results of another previous study of ours that found a positive serological rate of 46-58% for S. pneumoniae in elderly patients hospitalised with CAP [14] . This 3-fold difference in positive prevalence rates for S. pneumoniae between the two populations was found even though the tests were done in the same laboratory using the same methods. This difference provides evidence for the high level of reliability of the tests and indicates that although S. pneumoniae is the most common aetiology among hospitalised CAP patients, its prevalence is much lower as the aetiology of non-pneumonic LRTI among elderly hospitalised patients.",

This requirement, which is explained above, increased the diagnostic specificity but apparently reduced the sensitivity leading to the classification of unknown aetiology in some of the patients. Second, there may be other viral aetiologies, such as rhinovirus and coronavirus, which are known to cause acute bronchitis [7] , but are technically difficult to diagnose serologically.

Two studies that used advanced serological techniques to assess the aetiology of CAP in hospitalised patients reported a high rate of 38% of patients with evidence of more than one aetiology [13, 16] . Those studies, like the present one, found all possible combinations of pathogens and not only an association between bacteria and viruses.

The explanation for this paradox appears to lie in the low predictive value of the clinical manifestations of LRTI for the specific infectious aetiology of the infection. The most striking example is purulent sputum, whose presence does not allow differentiation of viral from bacterial causes [17] . The vast majority of the ambulatory population, of whom only some are elderly patients, is treated with antibiotics even though this therapy is ineffective in most of them.
