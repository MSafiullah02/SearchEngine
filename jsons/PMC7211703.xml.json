            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Generally, coronavirus falls into four genera--\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures. \u03b1 and \u03b2 coronaviruses infect only mammals while the \u03b3 and \u03b4 coronaviruses mainly infect birds(\n22, 23, 24, 25\n). Among them, there are 7 species that can infect human beings, that is, common coronavirus including HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 that belong to \u03b1 coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and CoV-HKU1 that belong to \u03b2 coronaviruses, and three highly pathogenic viruses, SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 that all belong to \u03b2 coronaviruses17\n,\n26\n,\n27. The novel coronavirus was initially isolated from three patients and the complete genome sequences were obtained. The three SARS-CoV-2 genomes clustered together within the sarbecovirus subgenus, which shows the typical \u03b2-coronavirus organization: a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), replicase complex (orf1ab), S gene, E gene, M gene, N gene, 3\u2032 UTR, and several unidentified nonstructural open reading frames(\n1\n). Chinese researchers have found that a gene sequence of coronavirus carried by Chinese rhinolophine is 96% identical with that of SARS-CoV-2, thus rhinolophine is considered as the natural host of SARS-CoV-227\n,\n28. Unfortunately, the intermediate host has not been determined yet, although it is speculated that pangolin may be the intermediate host. Based on the results of gene comparison, it was showed that SARS-CoV-2 was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, and SARS-CoV (about 79% identity), but was more distant from MERS-CoV (about 50% identity)(\n29\n). Furthermore, according to the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as its receptor(\n30\n). Currently, more structural and functional studies confirmed that ACE2 acted as the receptor for SARS-CoV-231\n,\n32.",

            "text": "It is known that most of the current influenza vaccines are inactivated vaccines, which plays a very important role in protecting people from influenza virus infection. Some approaches, such as formaldehyde, UV light, and \u03b2-propiolactone have been applied in the preparation of inactivated vaccines against SARS-CoV, which generally induced robust serum-neutralizing antibody (Ab) response in different immunized animals(\n39, 40, 41\n). For instance, He Y. et al. showed that high-titer antibodies elicited by the inactivated SARS-CoV in the immunized animals could recognize S protein, especially the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit, and potently block SARS-CoV entry(\n42\n). Some groups evaluated the safety of the inactivated vaccine for SARS-CoV and the results showed that all vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody and significant reductions of SARS-CoV after viral challenge. However, challenge of mice given any of the inactivated vaccines led to occurrence of lung lesion based on th2-biased immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration(\n43, 44, 45\n). In addition, Fan Luo et al. intramuscularly immunized Chinese rhesus macaques with 2.5 \u03bcg beta-propiolactone-inactivated whole SARS-CoV Z-1 vaccine, and boosted the immunization on day 7. Although this study revealed no exacerbation of infection in the immunized macaques following the challenge with SARS-CoV NS-1, the authors suggested that an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay should be performed in vitro to examine whether the immune sera induced by inactivated vaccine would mediate ADE in some cell lines such as K562, THP-1, and monkey\u2019s peripheral blood mononuclear cells(\n46\n). Therefore, we should be cautious in using the inactivated SARS-CoV as a vaccine since it may cause harmful immune and/or inflammatory responses.",

            "text": "Historically and contemporarily, live-attenuated vaccines have been used successfully in controlling measles, mumps, rubella, polio, yellow fever, and chickenpox infections and outbreaks47\n,\n48. Some researchers constructed recombinant forms of the full-length SARS-CoV S protein or RBD of S protein that was encoded into the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)(\n49\n), recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)(\n50\n), or an attenuated parainfluenza virus (BHPIV3), respectively51\n,\n52. BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally or intramuscularly with MVA/S and neutralizing antibodies were induced. Moreover, MVA/S administered by either route elicited protective immunity, as shown by reduced titers of SARS-CoV in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of the mice after viral challenge. Du L.et al. evaluated the immune protection of a rAAV encoding RBD vaccine in mouse model by intranasal inoculation, which induced strong mucosal immune responses and provided long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection(\n53\n). Other groups reported that immunization of monkeys via the respiratory tract with BHPIV3/SARS-S induced the production of SARS-CoV-neutralizing serum antibodies. After the challenge with SARS-CoV, all monkeys inoculated with BHPIV3/SARS-S did not shed any SARS-CoV while monkeys in control group shed SARS-CoV for 5-8 days49\n,\n52. Weingartl H et al. immunized ferrets with rMVA-S and the immunized ferrets developed a more rapid and vigorous neutralizing antibody response compared with control animals; however, after challenge with SARS-CoV, they also exhibited stronger in\ufb02ammatory responses in liver tissue than control animals, suggesting that vaccination with rMVA-S is associated with enhanced hepatitis(\n54\n), which is not seen in the above infection model. It is suggested that we should not only use mice or monkeys as animal model, but also use ferrets as the infection model, because of its sensitivity to SARS-CoV. Thus, sometimes we do not observe the pathological damage caused by vaccine immunization, which may be that the animal model used is not representative enough.",

Graham et al. provided a proof that rewiring the transcription regulatory networks (TRNs) limited reversion in an live-attenuated coronavirus vaccine candidate which are effective against SARS-CoV(\n56\n). Some SARS-CoV vaccine candidates were tested in clinical trials, showing that they could elicit antibody responses and are safe57\n,\n58, although their long-term safety profiles have not been reported.",

The S protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion59\n,\n60 and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity61\n,\n62. Generally, the S protein of coronavirus is functionally divided into the S1 subunit, responsible for receptor binding, and the S2 subunit, responsible for cell membrane fusion(\n63, 64, 65, 66\n). By aligning SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence with those of SARS-CoV and several bat-SL-CoVs, we predicted that the cleavage site for generating S1 and S2 subunits is located at R694/S695(\n67\n). In addition, it has been reported that S protein has strong immunogenicity and can induce high titer neutralizing antibody(\n63\n). RBD of SARS-CoV S1 is located in S318-510 and the key RBM is S425-494, of which R453 is critical for the complex formation(\n68\n). Notably, N479 and T487 of the RBD are important for the high-affinity association of S protein with ACE2(\n69, 70, 71, 72\n). Residues 442, 472 and 480 also contribute to receptor recognition and host range of SARS-CoV, although not as much as residues 479 and 48725\n,\n73\n,\n74. Besides, a point mutation at R441 or D454 of the RBD of SARS-CoV disrupts the antigenic structure and binding activity of RBD to ACE275\n,\n76. By comparing the amino acid sequence of S protein between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS CoV, it was found that the similarities of primary sequence between SARS-CoV-2-S and SARS-CoV-S (isolated from human, civet or bat) are around 76%-78% for the whole protein, around 73%-76% for the RBD, and 50%-53% for the RBM7\n,\n30.",

We aligned the sequence of S protein between SARS-CoV (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_004718.3) and SARS-CoV-2 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2). As shown in Figure 3\na, the five key residues responsible for the binding of the SARS-CoV RBD (residues 442, 472, 479, 480 and 487; SARS-CoV numbering) to the ACE2 receptor were variable in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues 455, 485, 493, 494 and 501; SARS-CoV-2 numbering). Although the five critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBM were different with that of SARS-CoV, residue Gln493 provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with SARS-CoV-2's capacity for human cell infection. Other critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 has acquired capacity for human-to-human transmission. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that SARS-CoV-2 also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except for mice and rats), implicating that these animal species may act as intermediate hosts or animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infections(\n30\n). S2 subunit of coronavirus is divided into two domains, HR1 and HR2. We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 HR1 and HR2 regions are able to interact with each other to form six helix bundle (6-HB), which brings the viral and cellular membranes in close proximity for fusion64\n,\n77. As shown in Figure 3b, several amino acid residues in HR1 of SARS-CoV-2, which are concentrated from 922 to 943 were variable with SARS-CoV (residues 904-925), while HR2 is completely identical between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (not shown), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S2, especially HR2 is a conserved target for pan-coronavirus vaccine. Together, these results suggest that S protein plays an important role in the infection and immunogenicity of coronavirus which promotes some research teams to prepare a vaccine based on full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2.",

For example, the expression of full-length S protein and its trimer of urbani strain by recombinant baculovirus can induce adequate neutralizing antibody against human and palm civet SARS pseudoviruses that bears S proteins of homologous or heterologous SARS-CoV variants (such as Tor2, GD03T13, and SZ3 strains) in vaccinated mice(\n81\n). These reports suggested that the full-length S protein is highly immunogenic and able to induce protection against SARS-CoV challenge. Besides, the neutralizing antibodies alone may be able to suppress virus proliferation. However, the risk in safety and final protective effect of the full-length S protein-based vaccine should not be underestimated. Some groups reported that although full-length S protein of SARS-CoV elicited a neutralizing antibody response, it also induced harmful immune responses including triggered infection of human B cells or other immune cells by SARS-CoV, and enhanced SARS-CoV infection with anti-SARS-CoV-S immune-serum after challenge with homologous SARS-CoV(\n82, 83, 84\n). Last year, Liu L. et al identified that anti-S protein IgG, in productively infected lungs, caused severe acute lung injury by skewing inflammation-resolving response in SARS-CoV macaque models. Subsequently, these antibodies were injected into healthy macaques that were then challenged with SARS-CoV. Interestingly, the macaques receiving the antibodies showed more severe lung injury than the control group, indicating that Antibody induced by SARS S protein vaccine candidate may cause antibody dependent enhancement (ADE)(\n85\n). Thus, it is speculated that the S protein of SARS-CoV contains some epitopes, which may induce humoral or cellular immune responses that exacerbate the pathology in some coronavirus infections(\n86\n). Protein Science, an American biotechnology company, once spent tens of millions to make a full-length S-protein vaccine of SARS-CoV. However, the vaccine development was suspended because of the safety problems in the immunized animals. Exactly, Liu G. et al. found that peptide S597-603 of S protein induced antibodies that enhanced infection both in vitro and in non-human primates(\n87\n). Perhaps, S protein-based vaccines against SARS-CoV could be engineered to avoid ADE via elimination of the S597-603 epitope.",

More importantly, SARS-CoV RBD did not cause immune damage in the animal model while full-length S protein could do51\n,\n95, 96, 97. It is speculated that there are some super-antigens in the region beyond the RBD of the full-length S protein. In this way, after the full-length S protein enters the animal model, it will induce abundant non-specific antibodies and immune cell activation, subsequently eliciting a large amount of cytokines, which will lead to severe immune damage, just like the pathogenic course of SARS-CoV. But why the antibody titer induced by full-length S protein is not as high as that induced by RBD. It is speculated that the antigen competition might result in a lower level of neutralizing antibody induced by full-length S protein than that induced by RBD. Therefore, RBD-based subunit vaccine may be the ideal and safer alternative for the development of coronavirus vaccine.",

However, Guo et al. investigated the immune responses against the recombinant S2 fragment (residues 681-980) in BALB/c mice, and found that the S2 fragment could induce specific cellular immune response and a high level of total IgG but little neutralizing antibodies against infection by SARS-CoV(\n105\n). Additionally, Zeng F et al purified the total S1- and S2-specific IgG from mice immunized with recombinant S1 or S2 proteins, respectively, and found that anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgGs were able to abolish the binding between S protein and its cellular receptor(s), although anti-S1 IgG showed a significantly higher blocking efficiency(\n106\n). As shown in Figure 2B, the amino acid sequences of HR1 and HR2 are highly conserved and homologous between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In fact, these domains are also highly conserved in other coronaviruses(\n104\n), thus the S2 subunit has potential to be used as a target for the development of pan-CoV vaccine against divergent virus strains.

            "text": "Very recently, many research teams have launched the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The safety is a crucial issue that we need to be aware of when making vaccines. Meanwhile, there is another issue needs attention. The human and civet isolates of SARS-CoV nestle phylogenetically within the spectrum of SARS-CoV-like (SL-CoV) strains isolated from the bats, and the civets may have served as intermediate amplification hosts that enable SARS-CoV to cross species for animal-to-human transmission70\n,\n112, 113, 114, 115. Additionally, RNA virus might well mutate in ways that would make previously effective vaccines useless. Thus, development of a safe and effective vaccine against both human and animal SARS-CoV strains is highly important for preventing future SARS outbreaks. On the other hand, given the high prevalence and wide distribution of coronaviruses, increasing human\u2013animal interface activities, the large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of CoV genomes, novel coronaviruses are likely to emerge periodically in humans due to frequent cross-species infections and occasional spillover events. A broad-spectrum SARS vaccine that is effective against all the coronaviruses using ACE2 as their receptor can be applied immediately when we face the recurrent threat of coronavirus. Particularly, taken SARS-CoV-2 as an example, the virus might disappear before the vaccine is developed. Therefore, development of safe and broad-spectrum vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-CoV-related virus is of great significance for protecting human from CoV infection. Based on the above analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various vaccines against SARS-CoV, the modified S protein is expected to be a candidate for a cross protective vaccine against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-related virus. Notably, we have recently demonstrated that a vaccine based on RBD of S protein against SARS-CoV could effectively cross neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, several scientists have tried to design a vaccine against all \u03b2-coronavirus, especially these ACE2-associated ones.",

The choice of adjuvants also affects the efficacy of respiratory virus vaccines and adjuvant has also been applied in the R&D of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Lung is a complex organ, which is rich in immune cells, such as macrophages. The pulmonary epithelial cells (AECs) also have the characteristics of some immune cells, such as secreting a large number of pulmonary surfactant A, D (PS-A, PS-D). The PS layer forms a strong barrier to prevent nanoparticles and hydrophilic molecules from accessing them, so as to protect the AECs from pathological damage(\n116\n). Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are the chief immune mediators to protect the body from viral infections, and can be secreted by AECs as well as immune cells following viral infection. Therefore, the activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in these two cell types can effectively enhance the production of IFN-I, and recapitulate the immune responses provoked by viral infection(\n117\n). However, it is still a great challenge to delivery STNG agonists into the cytosol of AECs without destroying the integrity of PS layer. Recently, two research teams from China and the United States cooperated to ingeniously use PS-biomimetic liposomes (PS-GAMP) to encapsulated 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic guanosine monophosphate\u2013adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), a natural and effective STING agonist118\n,\n119. Because of its resemblance to PS, PS-GAMP disguises \"self\" and escapes from immune surveillance following intranasal immunization. Together with SP-A and SP-D, PS-GAMP enters the alveolar macrophages (AMs), from which PS-GAMP fluxes into AECs through gap junctions between AMs and AECs. Subsequently, the STING pathway in AMs and AECs was activated without breaching PS and alveolar epithelial barriers. Through this mechanism, the adjuvant PS-GAMP combined with inactivated H1N1 vaccine generated broad-spectrum cross protection not only effectively against H1N1, but also against heterosubtypic H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9 virus infection within two days after a single immunization. This cross protection lasted for at least 6 months and induced the persistence of lung CD8+ TRM cells in vivo. It is also showed that PS-GAMP could enhance the recruitment and differentiation of CD11b+ dendritic cells (DC) and CD8+ T cells, as well as the humoral response(\n120\n). Thus, PS-GAMP strategy is a promising \u201cuniversal\u201d mucosal adjuvant for developing broad-spectrum vaccines against betacoronavirus lineage B (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, SARSr-CoVs).",

            "text": "There was a significantly harmful immune response after immunizing animals with inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV following challenge with the homotypic virus, although no obvious safety problem was observed in animal model after immunization. In addition, the inactivated vaccine against one serotype of dengue virus (DENV) can enhance individual infection with other serotypes(\n121\n). These observations suggested that harmful response after immunization with inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might also happen. Even if the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine does not elicit serious harmful immune response, it may enhance the infection of the mutated and/or another novel coronavirus by ADE. The subunit vaccine based on RBD can avoid ADE. However, RBM cannot serve as a universal vaccine candidate because of its large variation among different virus strains. The biggest advantage of mRNA and DNA vaccines or vector vaccines that is currently under clinical trials in the United States is that they do not need adjuvants. However, there are still potential safety risks of these mRNA or DNA vaccines. Therefore, the modified RBD combined with T cell epitopes and effective mucosal adjuvants will be the best choice for the preparation of a broad-spectrum and safe coronavirus vaccine. Of course, it should be noted that the choice of vaccine depends on the mortality rate of the disease. For infectious diseases with high mortality, such as EBOV, the effectiveness of vaccines is more important than safety. However, for low mortality disease (such as COVID-19), the safety of vaccines is more important than effectiveness. Additional safety concerns relate to effectiveness and safety against antigenic variants of SARS-CoV and for safety of vaccinated persons exposed to other coronaviruses.",
