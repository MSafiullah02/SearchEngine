Moreover, there were no significant differences of the pulmonary sequelae in three generation patients (Table 3) .

Beginning in December 2019, Chinese health authorities have been closely monitoring the cluster of COVID-19 pneumonia cases in Wuhan. On January 23, 2020 at 10:00, travel restrictions was executed in Wuhan. From the analysis of data, we find that secondary infections of first-generation increased fast in Xi'an before 25 January, 2020, but quickly decreased during about ten days due to the interruption of transmission by travel restrictions (17) . Similarly, Shaanxi province has activated first-level public health emergency response since 25 January, 2020 (18). A series of measures which aim to restrict social contact such as home quarantine, traffic control and suspension of public places was announced and worked. Therefore, second-and third-generation infections increased to the peak in early February and followed with reduction during ten days. These results demonstrated that subsequent measures in Wuhan and Xi'an have reduce transmissibility effectively, such as the traffic blockage and population quarantine. All rights reserved.

There was no difference in clinical symptoms among patients of different generations. At the time of admission, some of the three generations of patients had leukopenia and hypolymphocytes. The incidence of increased percentage of monocytes in first-generation cases is higher than in second-and third-generation patients. Previous investigations suggested that lymphopenia might be a key factor related to the severity and lethality of COVID-19 infection, while the monocytes was unusually noted for this disease (21) . Monocyte is considered to be the precursors of macrophages. It has the functions of phagocytosis and elimination of pathogens, and participates in immune reactions. After phagocytosis of antigens, it carries the antigenic determinants to lymphocytes to induce specific immune responses of lymphocytes (22) .

Furthermore, recent investigations characterized predominant radiological manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia, including GGO, consolidative pulmonary opacities, peripheral and diffuse distribution, bilateral involvement, which overlapped with various virus pneumonia (28) . Lee put forward the pattern approach of classifying the viral pneumonia into three patterns: bronchopneumonia, organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage patterns, which had been recognized and characterized thoroughly in previous histopathological and radiological studies (16, 29) . This classification may help stratify viral pneumonic patients in terms of their prognosis. Prior studies retrospectively assessed the relationship of these CT findings with clinical outcome and they concluded that patients presenting with diffuse alveolar damage pattern were prone to show more severe clinical course and adverse outcome, while patients with bronchopneumonia and organizing pneumonia pattern tended to present the mild illness and longer survival (30, 31) .",
