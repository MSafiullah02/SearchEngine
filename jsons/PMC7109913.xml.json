            "text": "Since the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) between November 2002 and June 2003 [1], subsequent smaller outbreaks have occurred as a result of laboratory negligence or reemergence of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from the natural reservoir [2\u20135\n]. These incidences bear witness to the fact that reemergence of SARS-CoV infection in humans is a real concern. Experience from the Guandong outbreak (which occurred between December 2003 and January 2004) suggests that the clinical presentation of disease and the transmission behavior of the reemerged SARS-CoV strain can be different from what was known before [4]. When a SARS outbreak occurs again, it is mandatory that a serological survey be conducted, to define the epidemiological character of the outbreak. Since these outbreaks may happen in places where a proportion of the population was exposed to the virus during a previous outbreak of SARS, a reliable method for differentiating between recent infection and past exposure is vital if a meaningful interpretation is to result from such investigations [4]. The avidity (functional affinity) of an antibody is a measure of the overall strength of interaction between antibody and antigen. The avidity of virus-specific IgG antibody is low during primary viral infection and increases with time [6\u20138\n]. However, exceptions to this rule have been observed for some viruses [9, 10]. Here, we report the maturation pattern of anti\u2013SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein\u2013specific IgG antibody (hereafter, \u201canti\u2013SARS-CoV IgG antibody\u201d) avidity over the course of a 10-month period after primary infection and discuss the potential applications of our findings",

These patients presented with acute-onset fever that progressed to pneumonia, which was otherwise unexplained. Nine patients (14.8%) required intensive care, all of whom eventually recovered. All 61 patients fulfilled the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for SARS [11] and had serological evidence of SARS-CoV infection, as determined by the anti\u2013SARS-CoV IgG antibody immunofluorescence assay described elsewhere [12]. Forty-one patients (67.2%) seroconverted, and 20 (32.8%) developed a \u2a7e4-fold increase in antibody titer.

The first step was to assess the concentrations of anti\u2013SARS-CoV IgG antibody in samples, so that samples that required further dilution for testing during the second step could be identified. On the basis of our serial-dilution experiments, samples with ODs of >2.5 needed to be further diluted to provide a linear range for measurement of avidity during the second step. Concentrations of anti\u2013SARS-CoV IgG antibody were measured by a recombinant nucleocapsid protein\u2013based enzyme immunoassay, ELISARS (IgGENE), in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, samples were diluted to a concentration of 1:50 by mixing 22 \u03bcL of serum with 1.1 mL of sample diluent. An 100-\u03bcL aliquot of the prediluted serum was added to an antigen-coated well. After incubation at room temperature (\u223c25\u00b0C) for 30 min, the wells were washed 3 times with the washing buffer provided. Anti\u2013human IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were added and were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After a second washing step, 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine was added as a substrate for color development. Optical density was measured at 450 nm",

After the first incubation step, 300 \u03bcL of urea was added to one of the wells, whereas the same volume of washing buffer was added to the other well, which served as a reference. On the basis of our initial optimization experiments using 5 early and 5 late samples (collected <20 and >250 days after fever onset, respectively), a soaking step at room temperature for 10 min with 4 mol/L urea diluted in washing buffer was found to be most suitable and, thus, was used in the present study.

On the basis of this phenomenon, measurement of antibody avidity can be used to resolve certain difficulties that may be encountered in assessment of SARS-CoV infection. First, it can be used to differentiate between primary infection and reexposure. Although it was not possible to include patients who had been reexposed in the present study, on the basis of experience with other viral infections that have a similar pattern of antibody avidity maturation [13], it is reasonable to infer that patients reexposed to SARS-CoV will mount a humoral memory immune response that includes the production of antibodies with high avidity within a short period of time. Second, the presence of antibodies with low avidity could provide alternative evidence for demonstrating a primary infection when the IgM assay result is in doubt. This is important, given that viral serological testing based solely on the determination of the presence of IgM can lead to false conclusions, because IgM responses last for only a very short period of time and could be missed if serum samples are collected too early or too late [14]. On the other hand, IgM can persist for months or even years after primary infection and reappear during secondary infection [15]. When interpreting our IgM results, one should be aware that the IgM assay used in the present study was based on the indirect enzyme immunoassay format, the sensitivity of which might be inferior to that of the IgM capture format, and that our omission of the IgG antibody removal step might have decreased the assay\u2019s sensitivity. Nevertheless, our IgM assay results for the 45 samples collected \u2a7d50 days after fever onset support the view that low antibody avidity could be a valuable alternative marker for defining primary infection, in particular when serum sample availability is limited in terms of collection time points. Our data show that all 36 samples with an avidity index of <40% were collected before day 50, whereas all 39 samples with an avidity index of >55% were collected after day 65. Avidity indices between 40% and 55% could be considered to represent \u201cthe maturation zone,\u201d in which the correlation between avidity and time since infection is less strong. Third, our comparison of the avidity indices for the 26 paired samples indicated that this approach could provide a helpful alternative to the use of increasing antibody concentration as serological evidence of recent infection. This is particularly important if convalescent samples are collected when antibody concentrations are no longer increasing, as was the case for most of our paired samples. Other possible applications of measurement of antibody avidity to SARS-CoV infection include use of the technique to assess humoral responses to vaccine candidates and to discriminate between primary and secondary vaccine failures",
