            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly described viral disease that first appeared within the past 2 years [1], [2]. The pathogenic agent is the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that represents a new strain of coronavirus. To date, there is no effective treatment currently involving supportive therapy while the presumed anti-viral immune response develops. This appears to consist of neutralizing Ab, as well as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that can be detected after SARS infection. We have previously shown that a nona-peptide corresponding to a sequence of the S2 protein from SARS-CoV could induce interferon-\u03b3-producing lymphocytes using an ELISPOT assay [3]. DimerX HLA-A2:Ig fusion protein/peptide complex staining and evaluation via flow cytometry have shown CTL for specific viral epitopes [4], [5]. In this study, we present evidence for the presence ofanti-SARS-CoV-specific CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from SARS-recovered donors using a SARS S2 protein nona-peptide derived DimerX HLA-A2:Ig fusion protein.",

Briefly, PBMCs (1 \u00d7 105) collected from the donors listed above were plated in triplicate in round-bottomed 96-well plates. The cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcg/ml of either nona-peptide in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. After 18-h stimulation, the cells were thoroughly mixed and transferred onto flat-bottomed 96-well nitrocellulose plates (HA Multiscreen, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) coated with anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb (2 \u03bcg/ml, 1-D1K; diluted in pH 9.6 carbonate buffer). The cells were then incubated for an additional 20 h. The plates were washed and blocked with 10% human AB serum for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. The IFN-\u03b3-secreted spots were detected using a commercial kit (MABTECH, Sweden) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The colored spots identifying the cytokine-producing cells were counted using a dissecting microscope. The mean number of spots from the triplicate wells was calculated and expressed as the number of specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells/1 \u00d7 105 cultured PBMC cells [8].",

Briefly, nona-peptide concentration was calculated as noted below by the formula and dissolved at 20 mg/ml using DMSO (SIGMA, US) and then further diluted in sterile PBS to 2 mg/ml until use, was incubated BD DimerX reagent, and was then exposed to 5 volume equivalents of citrate-phosphate buffer (pH5.8) at 37\u00b0C for 1.5\u20132 h. The pH of the mixture then was adjusted to 7.4 and the mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 36 h to allow the protein to refold. PBMCs from SARS patients or controls were blocked with human AB serum for 1 h before staining. The cells were suspended in PBS at a concentration of approximately 1 million cells per 50 \u03bcl and incubated with 4 \u03bcg loaded BD DimerX at 4\u00b0C for 1 h.

S1203 is a nona-peptide with Leu and Val at positions 2 and 9 that anchor in the HLA-A 2 peptide binding groove and show a similar high affinity to HLA-A2 molecules during T2 cell binding assay [4]. In PBMC from SARS-recovered donors, specific CD8+ CTLs for S1203 were identified by DimerX staining as well as with ELISPOT assay using this nona-peptide (Fig. 1\n). Furthermore, the results of DimerX staining paralleled the results of ELISPOT and both identify a class I MHC-restricted CD8+ T cell response (Table 1). In this study, PBMC from HLA-A2\u2212 SARS-recovered donors and healthy HLA-A2+ donors were also assayed and none of these controls responded in either assay system (Table 1). This suggests that DimerX HLA-A2:Ig is a useful tool in the screening of CTL directed against specific epitopes from the SARS-CoV proteins.",

            "text": "DimerX staining as well as Tetramer staining [4], [10] provides a direct method using flow cytometry to identify the specific CD8+ CTL. Tetramer technology is technically difficult to produce and is useful for only one specific peptide. In contrast, DimerX can present a variety of antigenic peptides, which in this case were combined with HLA-A2. Thus, the DimerX-peptide complex technique can be easily adopted in a clinic immunology lab. The time course of anti-viral-specific CTL identified with these techniques can be relatively short following recovery from viral infection. This minimizes the utility of a complex technology such as a Tetramer because it requires identifying and preparing the appropriate antigen-specific epitope. In contrast, the DimerX:HLA-A2 fusion protein/S1203 method for staining antigen-specific C*+ CTL appears to be a readily adaptable method to detect viral-specific cells during the post-viral recovery phase. This method could prove to be valuable in understanding the normal immune response to SARS-CoV as well as potentially helping to explain the varied outcome associated with SARS infection.",
