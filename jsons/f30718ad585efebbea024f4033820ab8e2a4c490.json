            "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-theart performance.",

According to the global case count from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) [3] (updated 1 May, 2020), 3,257,660 identified cases of COVID-19 have been reported so far, including 233,416 deaths and impacting more than 187 countries/regions. For COVID-19 screening, the reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been considered the gold standard. However, the shortage of equipment and strict requirements for testing environments limit the rapid and accurate screening of suspected subjects. Further, RT-PCR testing is also reported to suffer from high false negative rates [4] . As an important complement to RT-PCR tests, the radiological imaging techniques, e.g., X-rays and computed , where the red and green masks denote the GGO and consolidation, respectively. The images are collected from [9] .",

            "text": "Compared to X-rays, CT screening is widely preferred due to its merit and three-dimensional view of the lung. In recent studies [4] , [10] , the typical signs of infection could be observed from CT slices, e.g., ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the early stage, and pulmonary consolidation in the late stage, as shown in Fig. 1 . The qualitative evaluation of infection and longitudinal changes in CT slices could thus provide useful and important information in fighting against COVID-19. However, the manual delineation of lung infections is tedious and time-consuming work. In addition, infection annotation by radiologists is a highly subjective task, often influenced by individual bias and clinical experiences. Recently, deep learning systems have been proposed to detect patients infected with COVID-19 via radiological imaging [6] , [15] . For example, a COVID-Net was proposed to detect COVID-19 cases from chest radiography images [16] . An anomaly detection model was designed to assist radiologists in analyzing the vast amounts of chest X-ray images [17] . For CT imaging, a location-attention oriented model was employed in [18] to calculate the infection probability of COVID-19. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed in [19] using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. A paper list for COVID19 imaging-based AI works could be found in [20] . Although plenty of AI systems have been proposed to provide assistance in diagnosing COVID-19 in clinical practice, there are only a few works related infection segmentation in CT slices [21] , [22] . COVID-19 infection detection in CT slices is still a challenging task, for several issues: 1) The high variation in texture, size and position of infections in CT slices is challenging for detection. For example, consolidations are tiny/small, which easily results in the false-negative detection from a whole CT slices.",

Our motivation stems from the fact that, during lung infection detection, clinicians first roughly locate an infected region and then accurately extract its contour according to the local appearances. We therefore argue that the area and boundary are two key characteristics that distinguish normal tissues and infection. Thus, our Inf-Net first predicts the coarse areas and then implicitly models the boundaries by means of reverse attention and edge constraint guidance to explicitly enhance the boundary identification. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we also provide a semi-supervised segmentation system, which only requires a few labeled COVID-19 infection images and then enables the model to leverage unlabeled data. Specifically, our semi-supervised system utilizes a randomly selected propagation of unlabeled data to improve the learning capability and obtain a higher performance than some cutting edge models. In a nutshell, our contributions in this paper are threefold:",

In practice, segmenting different organs and lesions from chest CT slices can provide crucial information for doctors to diagnose and quantify lung diseases [25] . Recently, many works have been provided and obtained promising performances. These algorithms often employ a classifier with extracted features for nodule segmentation in chest CT. For example, Keshani et al. [26] utilized the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to detect the lung nodule from CT slices. Shen et al. [27] presented an automated lung segmentation system based on bidirectional chain code to improve the performance. However, the similar visual appearances of nodules and background makes it difficult for extracting the nodule regions. To overcome this issue, several deep learning algorithms have been proposed to learn a powerful visual representations [28] - [30] . For instance, Wang et al. [28] developed a central focused convolutional neural network to segment lung nodules from heterogeneous CT slices. Jin et al. [29] utilized GAN-synthesized data to improve the training of a discriminative model for pathological lung segmentation. Jiang et al. [30] designed two deep networks to segment lung tumors from CT slices by adding multiple residual streams of varying resolutions. Wu et al. [31] built an explainable COVID-19 diagnosis system by joint classification and segmentation.",

The (unsupervised) anomaly detection/segmentation could detect the anomaly region [32] - [34] , however, it can not identify whether the anomaly region is related to COVID-19. By contrast, based on the few labeled data, the semi-supervised model could identify the target region from other anomaly region, which is better suit for assessment of COVID-19. Moreover, the transfer learning technique is another good choice for dealing with limited data [35] , [36] . But currently, the major issue for segmentation of COVID-19 infection is that there are already some public datasets (see [20] ), but, being short of high quality pixel-level annotations. This problem will become more pronounced, even collecting large scale COVID-19 dataset, where the annotations are still expensive to acquire. Thus, our target is to utilize the limited annotation efficiently and leverage unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning provides a more suitable solution to address this issue.",

Currently, there is increasing focus on training deep neural network using the SSL strategy [38] . These methods often optimize a supervised loss on labeled data along with an unsupervised loss imposed on either unlabeled data [39] or both the labeled and unlabeled data [40] , [41] . Lee et al. [39] provided to utilize a cross-entropy loss by computing on the pseudo labels of unlabeled data, which is considered as an additional supervision loss. In summary, existing deep SSL algorithms regularize the network by enforcing smooth and consistent classification boundaries, which are robust to a random perturbation [41] , and other approaches enrich the supervision signals by exploring the knowledge learned, e.g., based on the temporally ensembled prediction [40] and pseudo label [39] . In addition, semi-supervised learning has been widely applied in medical segmentation task, where a frequent issue is the lack of pixel-level labeled data, even when large scale set of unlabeled image could be available [36] , [42] . For example, Nie et al. [43] proposed an attention-based semisupervised deep network for pelvic organ segmentation, in which a semi-supervised region-attention loss is developed to address the insufficient data issue for training deep learning models. Cui et al. [44] modified a mean teacher framework for the task of stroke lesion segmentation in MR images. Zhao et al. [45] proposed a semi-supervised segmentation method based on a self-ensemble architecture and a random patchsize training strategy. Different from these works, our semisupervised framework is based on a random sampling strategy for progressively enlarging the training set with unlabeled data.",

In this work, we focus on patient scale applications [18] , [22] , [49] , [50] , [53] - [55] , especially those based on CT slices. For instance, Wang et al. [49] proposed a modified inception neural network [56] for classifying COVID-19 patients and normal controls. Instead of directly training on complete CT images, they trained the network on the regions of interest, which are identified by two radiologists based on the features of pneumonia. Chen et al. [50] collected 46,096 CT image slices from COVID-19 patients and control patients of other disease. The CT images collected were utilized to train a U-Net++ [57] for identifying COVID-19 patients. Their experimental results suggest that the trained model performs comparably with expert radiologists in terms of COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, other network architectures have also been considered in developing AI-assisted COVID-19 diagnosis systems. Typical examples include ResNet, used in [18] , and U-Net [58] , used in [53] . Finally, deep learning has been employed to segment the infection regions in lung CT slices so that the resulting quantitative features can be utilized for severity assessment [54] , large-scale screening [55] , and lung infection quantification [15] , [21] , [22] of COVID-19.",

As can be observed, CT images are first fed to two convolutional layers to extract high-resolution, semantically weak (i.e., low-level) features. Herein, we add an edge attention module to explicitly improve the representation of objective region boundaries. Then, the low-level features f 2 obtained are fed to three convolutional layers for extracting the high-level features, which are used for two purposes. First, we utilize a parallel partial decoder (PPD) to aggregate these features and generate a global map S g for the coarse localization of lung infections. Second, these features combined with f 2 are fed to multiple reverse attention (RA) modules under the guidance of the S g . It is worth noting that the RA modules are organized in a cascaded fashion. For instance, as shown in Fig. 2 , R 4 relies on the output of another RA R 5 . Finally, the output of the last RA, i.e., S 3 , is fed to a Sigmoid activation function for the final prediction of lung infection regions. We now detail the key components of Inf-Net and our loss function.",

However, Wu et al.

Inspired by this observation, we propose to only aggregate high-level features with a parallel partial decoder component, illustrated in Fig. 3 . Specifically, for an input CT image I, we first extract two sets of low-level features {f i , i = 1, 2} and three sets of highlevel features {f i , i = 3, 4, 5} using the first five convolutional blocks of Res2Net [67] . We then utilize the partial decoder p d (\u00b7) [66] , a novel decoder component, to aggregate the highlevel features with a paralleled connection. The partial decoder yields a coarse global map S g = p d (f 3 , f 4 , f 5 ), which then serves as global guidance in our RA modules.",

Inspired by this procedure, we design Inf-Net using two different network components that act as a rough locator and a fine labeler, respectively. First, the PPD acts as the rough locator and yields a global map S g , which provides the rough location of lung infection regions, without structural details (see Fig. 2 ). Second, we propose a progressive framework, acting as the fine labeler, to mine discriminative infection regions in an erasing manner [68] , [69] . Specifically, instead of simply aggregating features from all levels [69] , we propose to adaptively learn the reverse attention in three parallel high-level features. Our architecture can sequentially exploit complementary regions and details by erasing the estimated infection regions from high-level side-output features, where the existing estimation is up-sampled from the deeper layer.",

An overview of our semi-supervised learning framework is shown in Fig. 5 . Our framework is mainly inspired by the work in [74] , which is based on a random sampling strategy for progressively enlarging the training dataset with unlabeled data. Specifically, we generate the pseudo labels for unlabeled CT images using the procedure described in Algorithm 1.

Therefore, we extend Semi-Inf-Net to a multi-class lung infection labeling framework so that it can provide richer information for the further diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. The extension of Semi-Inf-Net is based on an infection region guided multi-class labeling framework, which is illustrated in Fig. 6 . Specifically, we utilize the infection segmentation results provided by Semi-Inf-Net to guide the multi-class labeling of different types of lung infections. For this purpose, we feed both the infection segmentation results and the corresponding CT images to a multi-class segmentation network, e.g., FCN8s [75] , or U-Net [58] . This framework can take full advantage of the infection segmentation results provided by Semi-Inf-Net and effectively improve the performance of multi-class infection labeling.",

Specifically, they yield segmentation results that are close to the ground truth with much less mis-segmented tissue. In contrast, U-Net gives unsatisfactory results, where a large number of mis-segmented tissues exist. U-Net++ improves the results, but the performance is still not promising. The success of Inf-Net is owed to our coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, where a parallel partial decoder first roughly locates lung infection regions and then multiple edge attention modules are employed for fine segmentation. This strategy mimics how real clinicians segment lung infection regions from CT slices, and therefore achieves promising performance. In addition, the advantage of our semi-supervised learning strategy is also confirmed by Fig. 7 . As can be observed, compared with Inf-Net, Semi-Inf-Net yields segmentation results with more accurate boundaries. In contrast, Inf-Net gives relatively fuzzy boundaries, especially in the subtle infection regions.",

The results are shown in Tables V. Despite containing non-infected slices, our method still obtains the best performance. Because we employed two datasets for semi-supervised learning, i.e., labeled data with 100 infected slices (50 training, 50 testing), and unlabeled data with 1600 CT slices from real volumes.

First, the Inf-Net focuses on lung infection segmentation for COVID-19 patients. However, in clinical practice, it often requires to classify COVID-19 patients and then segment the infection regions for further treatment. Thus, we will study an AI automatic diagnosis system, which integrates COVID-19 detection, lung infection segmentation, and infection regions quantification into a unified framework. Second, for our multi-class infection labeling framework, we first apply the Inf-Net to obtain the infection regions, which can be used to guide the multi-class labeling of different types of lung infections. It can be seen that we conduct a two-step strategy to achieve multi-class infection labeling, which could lead to sub-optimal learning performance. In future work, we will study to construct an end-to-end framework to achieve this task. Besides, due to the limited size of dataset, we will use the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [82] or Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) [83] to synthesize more samples, which can be regarded as a form of data augmentation to enhance the segmentation performance. Moreover, our method may have a bit drop in accuracy when considering non-infected slices. Running a additional slice-wise classifier (e.g., infected vs non-infected) for selecting the infected slice is an effective solution for avoiding the performance drop on non-infected slices.",

From Table IV, we observe that No.4 (backbone + RA) increases the backbone performance (No.1) in terms of major metrics, e.g., Dice, Sensitivity, MAE, etc. This suggests that introducing the RA component can enable our model to accurately distinguish true infected areas. 3) Effectiveness of PPD & RA: We also investigate the importance of the combination of the PPD and RA components (No.6). As shown in Table IV, No.4 performs better than other settings (i.e., No.1\u223cNo.4) in most metrics. These improvements demonstrate that the reverse attention together with the parallel partial decoder are the two central components responsible for the good performance of Inf-Net. 4) Effectiveness of EA: Finally, we investigate the importance of the EA module. From these results in Table IV (No.2 vs. No.1, No.5 vs. No.4, No.7 vs. No.6), it can be clearly observed that EA module effectively improves the segmentation performance in our Inf-Net.",
