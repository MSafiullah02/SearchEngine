This review details the evidence and emphasises the opinion from which the guidelines were developed and, by doing so, highlights where evidence is lacking or contradictory.",

It seems that other pathways and local modulatory signals are also important (Lang and others 1988 [2b], Sanger and Andrews 2006 [3a] ). Peripheral emetogenic triggers may be abrogated by bilateral vagotomy, effects which are enhanced when combined with ablation of the greater splanchnic nerves, suggesting more than one signal pathway (Fukui and others 1993b [2b] The 'chemoreceptor trigger zone' of the brainstem has been identifi ed as the area postrema which is located on the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata adjacent to the caudal end of the fourth ventricle (Chernicky and others 1980 [2b] ). This region, lacking a blood-brain barrier, is responsive to circulating emetogens. As well as inputs from peripheral, vestibular and area postrema triggers, stimulation from higher centres has been proposed, presumably co-ordinated in the nucleus tractus solitarius.",

The age is important because some diseases are more common in young dogs, e.g. ingestion of foreign bodies, foreign body induced ileus ( . There are many more breed predilections that can be mentioned. Some diseases also have a gender predilection e.g. hypoadrenocorticism is more commonly seen in female dogs (Kintzer and Peterson 1997 [3a] ) and some diseases exclusively affect one gender (e.g. pyometra, prostatitis). A full and complete history is essential for evaluation of a vomiting dog. Information which should be obtained is listed ( Table 6 ). The most important distinction is that between vomiting and regurgitation, because their aetiologies are very different and this will direct specifi c diagnostic testing. Regurgitation is passive, with undigested food or saliva returned under gravity, whereas vomiting is a refl ex, accompanied by signs of nausea, hypersalivation and activity of the abdominal musculature.",

Dogs with simple, mild, acute self limiting emesis do not need further workup, and can be treated symptomatically. Many of these animals are not seriously ill, and may need no treatment. A recent study suggests 95% of dogs with emesis do not present to the veterinary surgeon (Hubbard and others 2007 [4a]). Even in those that present to a veterinary surgeon, in most cases of acute self limiting emesis, the aetiology is never determined: dietrelated factors (dietary indiscretion), infectious agents and toxins are considered the most important causes. If the signs resolve after 1 to 2 days, with or without symptomatic and supportive therapy, the tentative diagnosis of acute self limiting emesis is considered correct.",

These authors showed that in 89% of dogs with signs of vomiting, signs resolved in less than two days. The clinician should judge the need for further investigation and treatment; a suggested approach is summarized in the algorithm ( Figure 2 ). Emesis may be a desirable outcome following toxic ingestion, and antiemetics, especially where there is also a pro-kinetic effect, are not indicated where there is gastrointestinal obstruction. To minimise the risk of anti-emetics masking signifi cant clinical signs it is important to initially identify those cases requiring further investigation and to ensure effective follow-up examinations are planned to reassess the progress of cases that are treated symptomatically. A risk benefi t assessment should be made of the likely success of a particular drug in preventing and treating emesis versus the likelihood of the drug inducing adverse effects. If the veterinarian considers initial treat ment unnecessary or institutes nonspecifi c, symptomatic management for suspected acute self-limiting vomiting, pet owners should be advised that, following initial assessment, there is no immediate need for a more specifi c diagnosis or treatment and that non-specifi c therapy is suffi cient in many cases (Hubbard and others 2007 [4a]). They should be advised of the benefi ts and effects of therapy and of what outcome measures to monitor (see 'Monitoring' below). The use of an antiemetic drug should not delay any necessary investigation or treatment if deemed necessary by the clinician. Supportive care of the patient with emesis may include fl uid and electrolyte therapy to correct or prevent dehydration and/or electrolyte and acid-base therapy. Though treating the symptom itself will often improve patient demeanour and comfort, it is no replacement for making a correct diagnosis. [OEG D].",

In many clinical situations e.g. uraemia, emesis may occur because of a combination of stimuli (central and peripheral). The relative importance of the different pathways may or may not be apparent from the clinical presentation or diagnosis. The ideal drug will, therefore, prevent both central and peripheral stimuli of the 'vomiting centre' (see section 'Causes of vomiting'). In addition, because persistent and/or severe emesis can result in signifi cant fl uid loss and electrolyte disturbances, the ideal antiemetic drug should be without effect on the cardiovascular system since actions here can upset the delicate haemodynamic balance in a dehydrated patient. Furthermore, a drug with a very wide therapeutic index would be desirable, particularly as emesis can be associated with kidney and liver disease, two major organ systems involved in the clearance of drugs from the body. Drugs with narrow therapeutic indices would be unsafe to administer to dogs with signifi cant kidney or liver dysfunction. In addition central nervous system side-effects, such as sedation, might be undesirable in drugs used treat emesis because changes in central nervous system (CNS) function may make diagnosis of the underlying cause of the emesis or assessment of the progression of the dog's condition diffi cult and, potentially, predispose to adverse events such as aspiration. Finally, a lack of direct effects of an antiemetic on GI motility would be desirable in most cases, although a prokinetic effect may be benefi cial in some conditions such as chronic gastritis.",

In contrast, the trend in human gastroenterology is to continue to feed in the face of gastrointestinal signs, and there is now clear evidence that continuation of feeding during gastroenteritis has advantages (Sandhu 2001 [2b] ). There are no equivalent published studies assessing the relative merits of food withholding and early feeding in veterinary medicine. Given that the majority of dogs with acute gastrointestinal signs are likely to have self-limiting disease, it is unlikely that there would be a dramatic benefi t or detriment for either method. Finally, published data examining what dietary characteristics are most appropriate for acutely vomiting dogs are lacking. In the absence of such information, a highlydigestible diet seems most appropriate.",

They should be advised to re-present the patient after a maximum of 48 hours if there is continued emesis or if there is no improvement in other outcome measures. Alternative outcome measures include appetite (which may refl ect associated nausea), general demeanour, and other associated clinical signs e.g. diarrhoea.

The applicability of diagnostic testing modalities and the merit of traditional approaches to management, such as dietary changes, are discussed. The role and usefulness of both traditional and novel anti-emetic drugs is examined, including in specifi c circumstances such as following cytotoxic drug treatment. The review also examines areas in which common clinical practice is not necessarily supported by objective evidence and, as such, highlights questions worthy of further clinical research. REVIEW C.

Direct projections from this region to motor nuclei such as the caudal part of the ventral respiratory group have been identifi ed (Koga and Fukuda 1997 [2b]). The refl ex has visible phases of hypersalivation, retching and expulsion (Figure 1). Efferent pathways controlling these processes include the vagal and phrenic nerves, parasympathetic nerves to the salivary glands and somatic motor nerves to abdominal muscles [OEG B].",

Stimuli which cause vomiting can also reach the CNS through the blood stream (e.g. toxinscentral emetogens; e.g. apomorphine) to stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Within the central nervous system, inputs are integrated and the relayed to the 'vomiting centre' a collection of neurones in the brain stem which are thought to be the origin of the efferent arm of the vomiting refl ex.

A complete discussion of this information is outside the scope of the current review, but broadly speaking, both techniques can provide benefi t to hospitalised in-patients, but are associated with various complications. Most notably vomiting and other alimentary tract signs are a common complication of the enteral method of feeding (Abood and Buffi ngton 1992 [4a]). Thus one potential benefi t of controlling nausea and vomiting in companion animals is that it may enable enteral nutrition to be administered at an earlier opportunity and with lower associated morbidity. Data from clinical studies directly comparing EN and PN in dogs with alimentary tract disease are, however, extremely limited.Experimental studies in dogsTwo experimental studies have assessed the effects of early EN on pancreatic pathological features and gut barrier function in dogs with experimental acute pancreatitis(Qin and others 2002 [2b],Xu and  others 2006 [2b]). The conclusion from these studies was that EN is preferred over PN for cases of acute pancreatitis. Clinical studies are, however, recommended to determine applicability in this setting.",
