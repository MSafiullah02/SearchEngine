Many existing systems collect and analyze infectious disease information from news or media sources and then present it on the web in text format [13], [20], [23], [24], [27], [30]. Some systems send infectious disease information via e-mail or text messages [11]\u2013[18]. Other systems also provide data in extensible markup language (XML), Excel spreadsheet (XLS), and comma-separated values (CSV) files and simply present the infectious disease information and corresponding risk levels utilizing a map or chart [19]\u2013[32]. In other words, existing infectious disease information systems are text-centric. They do not include or only partially include visualized data. Therefore, users cannot easily understand information regarding infectious disease outbreaks at a glance.",

We collect infectious disease outbreak data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC). Currently, the KCDC only provides text data on infectious disease outbreaks, which is insufficient for effective transmission of infectious disease information. Utilizing these data, DOVE provides various effective charts containing infectious disease outbreak statistics sorted by district, time, infectious disease, gender, and age according to user input. The main benefits of DOVE are as follows:\n\u2022Users can see current infectious disease statistics at a glance through DOVE.\u2022Users can identify the characteristics of infectious diseases.\u2022Users can predict outbreaks of infectious diseases by investigating disease trends because DOVE provides not only current, but also past infectious disease outbreak statistics.\u2022DOVE is currently available on the web at http://www.epidemic.co.kr/statistics. It provides valuable information regarding infectious disease outbreaks to end users and helps researchers to study the characteristics of infectious disease outbreaks academically.",

In 1994, the United States began providing infectious disease outbreak information for the first time through the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases mail (ProMED-mail) [14], [15]. ProMED-mail sends infectious disease outbreak information via e-mail and is now available on the web. ProMED-mail procures information regarding infectious disease outbreaks by analyzing e-mails from its subscribers. It then filters this information through a review process, sends it to ProMED-mail subscribers via e-mail, and posts it on a website. On the website for ProMED-mail, users can retrieve infectious disease information by searching for keywords associated with an infectious disease, dates, or locations. ProMED-mail analyzes infectious disease information and presents the risk levels based on three colors of red, yellow, and green. Red indicates high risk, yellow indicates moderate risk, and green indicates low risk. The Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) is a disease information system developed in Canada in collaboration with the WHO in 1997 [16], [17]. This system displays real-time data regarding various public-health-related information and diseases. The GPHIN collects articles related to diseases from the web and analyzes them. The GPHIN then delivers filtered information to users via e-mail. When the e-mails are delivered, the GPHIN provides customized information according to pre-collected user preferences. Additionally, the system provides web search functionality, allowing users to view article information collected by the GPHIN. The Medical Information System (MedIsys) collects infectious disease information from media sources and analyzes it. Users can receive the analyzed information via e-mail or SMS by searching for keywords or selecting countries. Finally, GETWELL is a system that provides disease information utilizing the search engine of a medical website [18]. GETWELL stores queries from the search engine in its database with search dates, analyzes the queries, and sends the resulting information to users via e-mail.",

HealthMap provides information regarding the occurrence of infectious diseases, primarily through geographic locations. This system collects infectious disease outbreak data in real time via Google, the news media, WHO, and infectious-disease-related websites. The filtered information includes the date of infectious disease outbreak, location where the infectious disease appeared, and other infectious disease information. The location of an outbreak is shown on a map. HealthMap calculates weights according to the date of occurrence, number of disease outbreaks, and location information, and it displays risk levels on a map. The aforementioned ProMED-mail also provides location information via the HealthMap in web-based systems. BioCaster also presents new keywords and information related to diseases filtered by month or week. Google Flu Trends analyzes influenza-related terms entered by users with regard to specific regions and then classifies influenza activity into five grades: intense, high, moderate, low, and minimal. The system then visualizes the grades on a map. Flunet is a web-based system implemented by the WHO to create a global influenza network. Flunet fetches weekly data from influenza centers in several countries, analyzes outbreak information, and fetches infectious disease information from national agencies and the media in real time. This system visualizes the risk of influenza in a country on a map. Finally, EpiSPIDER extracts subjects, dates, and location information related to diseases from data collected by news agencies and other sources. This system provides disease information for a year on a map.",

On the server side, we utilize jetty-9.0.6 for our web server and Spring Framework 4 [42] for our application server. Jetty is a JAVA web server and JAVA servlet container. Spring Framework is an open-source application framework for supporting JAVA. This framework provides a variety of functions for dynamic implementation of websites. Our system utilizes the Spring Framework to interact with the database and store or retrieve data. The framework then responds to requests from the web server in an appropriate form.

With recent advances in medical technology, humans have overcome many diseases by developing vaccines. However, vaccine development requires a considerable amount of time. Therefore, until vaccines are developed, a temporary method to help to prevent infectious diseases is necessary. Most existing infectious disease information systems display only text-centric information with regard to infectious disease outbreaks. Therefore, grasping infectious disease outbreak information at a glance is difficult for users. The infectious disease information system proposed in this paper provides infection outbreak information through various forms of charts. We described our system configuration and showcased various implementation results in this paper. Our system, DOVE visualizes statistical data by district, time, infectious disease, gender, and age through a web interface. Users can not only infer the characteristics of infectious diseases from various charts but also predict their occurrence based on district, time, gender, and age. We believe that DOVE can aid people in easily identifying and preventing infectious diseases. DOVE is currently live on the web at http://www.epidemic.co.kr/statistics.",
