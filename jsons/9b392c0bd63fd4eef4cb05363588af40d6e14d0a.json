The heterogeneity of the CT data 329 may affect the results of the study. Second, none of the patients underwent a lung biopsy or 330 autopsy, because of the comparatively better outcomes of the patients in this study. Therefore, the 331 CT findings of the lung could not be verified by histopathology. Finally, this was a retrospective 332 study with initial CT images during hospitalization, mainly demonstrated the early pulmonary 333 lesions in patients with COVID-19. A further longitudinal research was needed to focus on the 334 long-term follow-up, to provide dynamic CT evaluation for pulmonary lesions and to obtain the 335 data of long-term pulmonary function changes. 336",
