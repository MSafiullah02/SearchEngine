The closer it gets to their homes, the more people become worried. But what about people on the front lines? Nurses, doctors, healthcare workers, and other medical professionals who are testing for and treating patients with COVID-19 are at a higher risk of contracting it than the general public. What can they do to take care of themselves, physically and emotionally? (Magellan Health Insights, 2020) . As if exposure to the COVID-19 during the global pandemic was not enough, healthcare workers face another risk: burnout due to overstress in an increasingly burdened healthcare system. The combination of stress and possible exposure puts healthcare professionals, from physicians and nurses to specialists, at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 and potentially spreading it to others (Health Care Finance, 2020).",
