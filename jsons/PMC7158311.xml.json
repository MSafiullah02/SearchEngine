However, their use has declined sharply in recent decades. Approximately 191,000 were used in 2013 in biomedical research and teaching in the United States (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 2010), which is down from a high of 599,000 animals in 1985. Publications of research using guinea pigs have decreased from approximately 3500 per year in the 1980s to fewer than 1000 publications in 2011 (MEDLINE). Compared with other rodent models, they more closely model human vitamin C metabolism and some immunological responses, for example, airway reactivity in asthma. However, they have largely been overshadowed by rats and mice, which have a shorter life cycle, larger litters, have been successfully genetically modified, and are subject to fewer regulations in the United States. The guinea pig was the first laboratory animal species derived and maintained in an axenic state (Wagner and Foster, 1976). Guinea pigs have been used in a variety of studies, including anaphylaxis, asthma, delayed hypersensitivity, genetics, gnotobiotics, immunology, infectious disease, nutrition, otology, and pharmacology, and for research in space (Gray, 1998). They are used by the pharmaceutical industry for preclinical testing of cardiac safety of new drugs, and hairless guinea pigs are used for development and testing of topical drug preparations (Hauser et al., 2005.) Guinea pigs are also used extensively in the medical device industry for sensitivity testing (e.g., Beuhler and Kligman tests), and as a source of serum complement in laboratories using the complement fixation test to diagnose infectious disease.",

Small volumes (e.g., 100 \u03bcl) can be collected by jugular, saphenous, or cephalic venipuncture. Collection of more than a few drops of blood generally requires techniques that require anesthesia, e.g., retro-orbital bleeding, cranial vena cava puncture, or terminal cardiac puncture. Guinea pigs are also challenging to intubate or to dose orally due to their unique pharyngeal anatomy; an elongated soft palate covers the back of the throat, leaving only the small palatal ostium for access to the trachea and esophagus.",

However, the historical erythrocyte values reported were lower than those seen currently in young, specific pathogen-free (SPF) guinea pigs (Table 6.1\n). The historical mean white count was considerably higher, suggesting that underlying subclinical disease may have contributed to a relative anemia and leukocytosis. Table 6.1 gives both historical values from the literature and values reported in 2008 for young,\nna\u00efve laboratory guinea pigs; the latter data are probably a better representation of reference ranges in contemporary animal facilities. Lymphocytes are the predominant leukocyte in the peripheral blood. Neutrophils (heterophils or psuedoeosinophils) have distinct eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm (Schalm et al., 1975, Sanderson and Phillips, 1981). The Foa-Kurloff or Kurloff cell is an estradiol-dependent mononuclear leukocyte unique to the guinea pig. These cells are found primarily in the thymus and in the sinusoids of the spleen, liver, and lung, with increased numbers in the peripheral circulation during pregnancy. Large numbers are seen also in the placenta, where they may have a role in preventing the maternal rejection of the fetal placenta during pregnancy (Marshall et al., 1971). The Kurloff cell (Fig. 6.2\n) has a large mucopolysaccharide, intracytoplasmic inclusion body, which is metachromatic and periodic acid-Schiff positive, and contains proteoglycans (Landemore et al., 1994) and hydrolytic enzymes (Taouji et al., 1994), similar to the smaller intracytoplasmic granules found in natural killer (NK) cells. The Kurloff cell has NK cytotoxic activity in vitro and may be part of cancer resistance in the guinea pig (Debout et al., 1995).",

The incisors are normally white, unlike the yellow to orange incisors of other rodents. The upper incisors are shorter than the lower pair. The oral cavity is small and narrow, and the soft palate covers nearly the entire back of the pharynx, with only the small palatal ostium offering access to the esophagus and trachea. This makes the guinea pig an obligate nasal breather (Nixon, 1974) and makes intubation and oral gavage challenging.",

Behaviors in guinea pigs that may affect experimental outcomes or harm animals include hair chewing, skin biting, ear nibbling, trampling of young, boars climbing from pen to pen, and intermale aggression. In mixed-sex groups, a dominant male hierarchy and a less defined female hierarchy develop. Scent marking with urine, anal, and supracaudal gland secretions and vocalization and agonistic displays are used to assert dominance and defend territory. The presence or absence of barbering, ear chewing, wounds, and fighting are evidence of competition and social status. Research and breeding guinea pigs are typically housed in groups of sows only or of one boar with up to five sows. In harem breeding situations, a dominant female may be apparent by her lack of fight wounds or hair loss from barbering. Sexually immature males can be housed together, but mature boars may fight and group housing of adult males is not recommended. Shelters placed in a cage with several males reduce intramale aggression (Agass and Ruffle, 2005, Walters et al., 2012).",

The organism is a short, gram-negative rod or coccobacillus, aerobic, motile, and non-spore-forming. Growth in vitro is best at 30\u00b0C but is slow to poor at 37\u00b0C, with minute, circular, pearlescent colonies present at 24 h and maximum-sized colonies apparent at 72 h. Colonies embed in the media and are surrounded variably by a zone of \u03b2-hemolysis (Boot et al., 1994, Brabb et al., 2012). Immunologic studies (Wullenweber and Boot, 1994) and macrorestriction digestion of DNA techniques, as well as evidence of phenotypic modulation of surface components, provide evidence for serotypic variation within the species. Restriction enzyme analysis of chromosomal DNA demonstrated that diversity among isolates was striking even within a host species (Sacco et al., 2000). The organism variably dissociates in culture (isogenic mutation), and these isolates vary in hemolysin, dermonecrotoxin, proteases, adenylate cyclase, and hemagglutinin production, which may affect host specificity, virulence, and disease manifestation (Griffith et al., 1996).",

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) serologic testing are more sensitive than culture for detecting the organism, but various Bordetella antigenic variants should be used in serologic testing because of antigenic variations described earlier (Wullenweber and Boot, 1994).",

Infections may be subclinical. Signs may be limited to mild reddening of the eyelids, or can include conjunctivitis with serous to purulent exudate, rhinitis, and genital tract infections (Deeb et al., 1989). Abortions and lower respiratory tract infections are reported. The clinical disease is self-limiting, with complete recovery in 3\u20134 weeks. Historically, detection was based on demonstration of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in Giemsa- or Macchiavello-stained conjunctival epithelial cells. More sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are available and have been used to detect the organism in guinea pigs and other species (Everett et al., 1999, Lutz-Wohlgroth et al., 2006, Pantchev et al., 2009) Differential diagnoses include causes of bacterial conjunctivitis in guinea pigs: streptococci, coliforms, S. aureus, and Pasteurella multocida. The disease is self-limiting and typically does not require treatment. The conjunctival and genital infections in guinea pigs have served as models for the human disease (Rank et al., 1979, Deeb et al., 1989, Rank and Sanders, 1992).

Associated signs are central nervous system dysfunction and hindlimb paralysis. The virus may cause a lymphocytic infiltration in meninges, choroid plexi, ependyma, liver, and lungs. The liver is the best site for IFA detection of the virus, and antibodies can be detected by ELISA.

Probable primary roles of vitamin C are acting as a cofactor in hydroxylation and amidation reactions by transferring electrons to enzymes that provide reducing equivalents (i.e., protons) and scavenging both intracellular and extracellular superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen, whose activity results in tissue damage (Chakrabarty et al., 1992).

Alopecia in the absence of aggressive grooming and chewing by other guinea pigs may occur also in young animals at weaning, when the hair coat changes character, and when guinea pigs are on low-protein or low-calorie diets, and within social relationships (see Section III, C, 1).",

Failure of the fibrocartilaginous pelvic joint to separate adequately occurs most often in sows bred for the first time over 7 months of age, after the symphysis usually fuses and becomes resistant to relaxin. Signs of dystocia include a still-narrow symphysis as gestation nears day 73, straining, depression, and vaginal discharge. Prevention involves breeding first before 7 months of age, preventing obesity and fasting while pregnant, and removing animals with a known family history of dystocia. Young guinea pigs involved in a dystocia experience hypoxia, which is often fatal. Treatment involves digital removal of the fetuses from the tract, providing the sow calcium, glucose, and 1\u20133 units/kg oxytocin (only if public symphysis is confirmed to be open), or cesarean section (Martinho, 2006, Williams, 2012).",

Prevention and treatment of bumblefoot and hyperkeratosis involve provision of smooth wire or solid-bottom cage floors with bedding, good sanitation, reduction of obesity, and, in severe cases, antibiotic treatment, softening with lotion, and surgical debriding. S. aureus can also cause pneumonia, mastitis, conjunctivitis, cheilitis, and osteoarthritis. The bacterium has been associated with an exfoliative dermatitis characterized by alopecia, erythema, scabs, and epidermal cracks (Ishihara, 1980). Staphylococci apparently enter the skin through abrasions. The histologic lesion is parakeratosis with minimal inflammation (Percy and Barthold, 2007). Pododermatitis rapidly progresses to osteomyelitis so quick and effective treatment is essential. Amputation is not an option, even in pet guinea pigs, due to how their body weight is distributed.

Necropsy signs include a pitted subcapsular renal surface with pale streaks extending into the cortex and even into the medulla. This segmental to diffuse interstitial fibrosis causes the kidney to have an irregular surface.

Panoophthalmitis is usually due to an infection with Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (Kern, 1989). An upper molar root abscess may extend into a maxillary sinus and orbit, causing exophthalmos. Other causes of exophthalmos in guinea pigs are orbital trauma, foreign bodies, sialocele, lacrimal gland cysts or inflammation, and neoplasia (Grahn et al., 1995). Allgoewer et al. (1999) reported conjunctival lesions with lymphosarcoma.",
