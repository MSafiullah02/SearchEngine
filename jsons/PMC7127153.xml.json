            "text": "The lower molecular weight of thiol-containing molecules such as L-Cysteine (L-Cys), homocysteine (Hcy) and glutathione (GSH) are frequently involved in various biological actions due to its wide distribution in living organisms. In addition, thiols are playing important role in reversible redox homeostasis and cellular functions in the biological system [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Especially, L-Cys as a semi-essential thiol-containing amino acid, which is most important in peptide and protein synthesis, detoxification, metabolism, and neuronal tissues [[5], [6], [7]]. In addition, L-Cys can be easily cross-linked with bio-macromolecules via disulfide bonds and coupled with enlargement and hindrance of senility of the cells and tissues in the living system [[8], [9]]. However, a series of disorders could be associated with the problem of L-Cys such as slow growth, muscle and fat loss, hair depigmentation, weakness, edema, skin lesions, liver damage, lethargy, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and acquired immune deficiency syndromes [[10], [11], [12]]. Hence, there is an urgent demand for accurate and low-level detection of L-Cys with simple and highly sensitive analytical techniques. Thus far, L-Cys was quantified with various classical analytical techniques such as UV\u2013vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, gas chromatography and immunoassay, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), fluorescence-coupled HPLC and electrochemical methods [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. Among these traditional methods, herein the fluorescence method was used for detection of L-Cys by taking advantage of the merits of simplicity, high sensitivity, low cost, selectivity and versatility [[23], [24]].",

Particularly, reduced graphene oxide (rGO), a two-dimensional (2D) thin layer nanosheet with hexagonal honeycomb lattices of carbon sheet, has been widely used in various fields such as nanotechnology, materials science and biotechnology [31]. On the other hand, the noble-metal nanoparticles, especially gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), have attracted tremendous interest in biological applications due to its specific large surface area, superior biocompatibility, and excellent conductivity. In addition, they also act as an efficient catalyst for electron transfer process [[32], [33], [34]]. Accordingly, the Au NPs have been widely applied for ion detection, molecular identification, and chemical catalysis, while showing the prospects in bio-labeling and bio-sensing [22]. For instance, the biocompatible polymer and peptides conjugated with Au NPs could be used for biomedical applications during the decades. Specifically, Gelatin (GEL) is a helically structured biopolymer matrix, is most abundant in animal skin and bone. Moreover, GEL is a denatured product of collagen and utilized for the entrapment of biomolecules for the preparation of biosensors [[35], [36], [37]]. Zhang et al. adopted gelatin as reducing and stabilizing agent to immobilize Au NPs with carboxylic single-walled carbon nanotubes for use of cytosensing and drug uptake [38].",

The obtained rGO/Au nanohybrid shows excellent sensitivity and selectivity towards the detection of L-Cys. The fluorescence sensing of L-Cys was investigated based on the fluorescence turn-on process. When coordinated with Au NPs, the fluorescence of rGO was diminished due to the energy transfer from rGO to Au NPs. Then, the fluorescence recovery of rGO was obtained upon the addition of L-Cys owing to the strong interaction between Au NPs and L-Cys prevents energy transfer from rGO to Au NPs. For practical application, this nanohybrid based sensor was successfully demonstrated to detection of L-Cys in Colo-205 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) and MKN-45 (gastric carcinoma) cancer live cells by using confocal fluorescence microscopy.",

            "text": "Based on acquired fluorescence sensing results, a plausible mechanism was proposed for the fluorescence enhancement of rGO/Au nanohybrid on the addition of L-Cys. When the Au NPs are attached with rGO, the energy transfer takes place from rGO to Au NPs on the excitation. Consequently, the fluorescence intensity of rGO is diminished via the effect of energy transfer. This process was confirmed by the comparison of fluorescence intensity of rGO in the absence and presence of Au NPs. Indeed, the rGO exhibited strong fluorescence as compared to that of rGO/Au (Figure S-4), verifying the energy transfer occurrence from rGO to Au NPs. Similar FRET phenomena between Au nanocluster and GO were reported previously by Nguyen et al. and Xiaofei et al. [[64], [65]]. Then, upon the addition of L-Cys, the energy transfer process could be probably suppressed. The L-Cys may strongly interact with Au NPs because the presence of thiol group in L-Cys induces strong binding with Au NPs [[25], [63]]. Accordingly, the composite like L-Cys surrounded Au NPs may be formed via Au-S binding formation and thus affected the interaction between rGO and Au NPs to prevent the energy transfer between them. That is why the fluorescence of rGO was enhanced upon the addition of L-Cys. To demonstrate the fluorescence enhancement of rGO is caused by the block of energy transfer, and the fluorescence spectra of rGO (without Au NPs) were recorded with various concentrations of L-Cys (Figure S-5). The fluorescence intensity of rGO does not alter even in the presence of higher concentration of L-Cys (0.1 \u03bcM).",

The reason for the lower selectivity of GSH and Hcy might be mainly due to the steric hindrance effect of these thiol-containing biomolecules. For instance, GSH contains more functional groups such as amino, carbonyl and carboxylic groups around \u2212SH group causing strong steric hindrance effect. This effect weakens the interaction of \u2212SH group in GSH with rGO/Au. Consequently, rGO/Au nanohybrid exhibits lower selectivity towards GSH compared to that of Hcy and L-Cys. When compared to Hcy, the L-Cys exhibits lower steric hindrance due to its smaller structural size, which can feasibly allow for the stronger interaction between the rGO/Au and L-Cys.",

Then, the fluorescence images of incubated cells were recorded at the excitation of 405 nm, as shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6\n. For rGO/Au nanohybrid in the absence of L-Cys, the confocal fluorescence images of cells showed a very weak fluorescence signal (Figs. 5a\u2013c and 6a\u2013c). Then, the fluorescence signal became stronger with the presence of L-Cys as similarly observed in the steady-state fluorescence measurement. Figs. 5d\u2013f and 6d\u2013f show the confocal fluorescence images of rGO/Au in the presence of L-Cys (200 nM). This result reveals that the L-Cys was successfully detected in the live cells based on the fluorescence recovery of rGO/Au nanohybrid. At the same time, this rGO/Au nanohybrid sensor system showed good biocompatibility in both live cancer cells. Based on these confocal image results, we can conclude that the rGO/Au nanohybrid could be used as a superior sensor system towards the detection of L-Cys within live cells.",
