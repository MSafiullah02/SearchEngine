For nonasthmatics, a DI can reverse bronchoconstriction (bronchodilatory effect) [1,2], and when taken prior to bronchochallenge, DIs can attenuate the severity of airway narrowing caused by a subsequently administered constricting agent (bronchoprotective effect) [3]. These beneficial effects of DI are characteristically diminished or absent in asthmatics [3\u20135]. Lack of DI-induced bronchodilation and bronchoprotection are now recognized as consistent features of asthma, highlighting a basic difference between asthmatic and nonasthmatic airways, possibly as a result of asthmatic airways being stiffer than normal [6].",

We have shown that the development of passive stiffness is separate from the development of active force in ASM [7]. The stiffness related to tone can be reversed by the use of bronchodilators that relax ASM [8], but the stiffness related to the passive components of the airways, including that associated with the extracellular matrix and the relaxed ASM, remains. A different therapeutic approach is needed for targeting passive stiffness. Studies from our laboratory revealed that a component of the passive ASM stiffness likely stems from its cytoskeleton [7]. We showed that this component is calcium sensitive and can be regulated by intracellular signaling pathways, especially those associated with Rho kinase (ROCK) [7,9,10].",

The ASM functions in a mechanically dynamic environment. Oscillatory strain associated with tidal breathing and DIs is known to soften the cytoskeleton and reduce contractility in ASM [11]. The term softening refers to increased compliance. This mechanotransduction likely explains the long-recognized phenomenon that \u201cbreathing is good for breathing.\u201d Recently, it has been shown that superimposed pressure oscillation on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is more effective than standard CPAP in treating obstructive sleep apnea [12]. This study provided an example of combined mechanical/medical treatment for a breathing disorder by superimposing a second oscillation through a device on top of that due to breathing alone to achieve amplified therapeutic benefits. Similarly, it has been shown that superimposed length oscillation on isolated mouse tracheal rings is more effective than \u201cbreathing\u201d alone in inducing airway relaxation [13].",

We hypothesize that ASM relaxation can be synergistically enhanced by the combination of these interventions because drug-induced softening of the cytoskeleton enhances FO-induced relaxation which in turn facilitates further softening of the muscle. This may lead to the design of a new device that provides tolerable pressure fluctuations in the airways which then allows bronchodilators and/or ROCK inhibitors at low doses to achieve desired level of bronchodilation while minimizing their side effects.",

All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Care and the Biosafety Committee of the University of British Columbia and conformed to the guidelines set out by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Ovine tracheas were obtained from a local abattoir, transported in ice-cold physiological saline solution (modified Krebs solution) to our laboratory, and stored in fresh Krebs solution at 4 \u00b0C. The experiments were performed within 4 days of obtaining the tracheas. The composition of the Krebs solution was: 118 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 22.5 mM NaHCO3, 2 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, and 2 g/l dextrose at pH 7.4. Smooth muscle strips devoid of epithelium and loose connective tissue were dissected from the posterior membranous portion of the trachea while being maintained at the in situ length (taken as a reference length, Lref), i.e., the distance between the two insertion points of the muscle to the cartilage ring under relaxed condition. Aluminum clips were then attached to the ends of the muscle strip. Through these aluminum clips and silk thread, the muscle strip was attached to a force/length transducer (Duo mode, model 300 C, Aurora Scientific, Inc., Aurora, ON, Canada) with minimal passive resting tension and submerged in 37 \u00b0C Krebs solution aerated with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide.

The thickness was estimated to be 0.25 mm as the thickness of the muscle sheet in comparable sizes of tracheas is rather constant from our previous morphological measurements [7,10]. By considering the muscle strip wrapped around end to end to form a cylinder with the muscle strip width as the height (h), we could calculate the tension along the length of the muscle, or the circumference of the cylinder, given the pressure inside the cylinder. According to LaPlace law, the tension (T) per segment h in the wall of a hollow cylinder is directly proportional to the cylinder's radius (r) and the distending pressure (P) across the wall, i.e., T = Pr/h. We used values of the pressure across the wall as 5 cmH2O during tidal breathing and 40 cmH2O during DI [14]. We calculated for each muscle strip according to its dimensions what the tension would be during tidal breathing and during DI. This tension was compared with the amplitude of FO (6% Fmax). A representative example is shown in Fig. 2(a). When compared to the tension during tidal breathing and DI, the amplitude of the FO that we applied to the muscle strips was 560\u00b160% of the predicted tension during tidal breathing and 70\u00b18% of the predicted tension during DI.",

We chose 30% Fmax, which gives a relatively large amount of shortening and minimal relengthening in time control to maximize the resolution for the response due to interventions. When these interventions were applied alone, they each had no effect on muscle relengthening just like the time control.

However, it is known that regular use of long acting \u03b22-agonists could lead to tolerance [15], making them ineffective or less effective in treating asthma attacks [16]. Safety concerns for \u03b22 agonists include cardiovascular side effects and death [17\u201319]. Desensitization of the \u03b22-adrenoceptors and activation of phosphodiesterases, which break down cAMP, has been suggested as an underlying mechanism for the loss of effectiveness of \u03b22-agonists in long-term asthma treatment [20,21].

Therefore, one would expect that the combined effect of salbutamol and H1152 would be muscle relaxation and stiffness reduction. However, in the absence of FO, salbutamol and H1152 interventions, collectively or individually, resulted in no reduction in muscle stiffness (Fig. 5(a)). These surprising results could be due to the low concentrations of the drugs used. The synergistic effect of salbutamol + H1152 in causing muscle relaxation observed in our experiments, therefore, cannot be explained by mechanisms related to alteration of ASM stiffness.",

The authors suggested that the bronchodilator reduced the stiffness of the airway wall which then allowed the oscillation to induce greater relaxation. Our study first of all showed a trend for an increase in stiffness over time, which is not surprising. In chronically shortened ASM, we observed an increase in the muscle's ability to generate force, which we coined force adaptation [23]. The increase in stiffness with time may be related to this phenomenon. Second, compared to time control at equivalent time points, salbutamol at 10\u22127 M did not reduce muscle stiffness. This finding does not contradict that of Ansell et al. because we did not test the same bronchodilator nor at the same concentration. They used doses from 10\u22127 to 10\u22124 M isoprenaline, and it was only at higher end of the concentration spectrum that isoprenaline enhanced the effect of oscillation. In fact, they showed that the \u03b22 agonist at 10\u22127 M did not increase ASM strain during pressure oscillation.",

This suggests that the synergistic effects observed in combined interventions that involved H1152 and FO could stem from alterations in cytoskeletal stiffness.

A notable advantage of this type of therapy is that the low drug doses will likely reduce side-effects and the development of tolerance. To deliver the appropriate pressure oscillation to the lung, a device similar to the CPAP machine could be developed. The disease mechanisms are likely very different for obstructive sleep apnea and asthma, and the positive airway pressure used for treatment of sleep apnea [12] may not be necessary for treating asthma.
