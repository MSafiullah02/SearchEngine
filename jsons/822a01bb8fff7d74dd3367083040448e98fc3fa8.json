            "text": "Large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current Coronavirus pandemic. Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and define cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives. With the imperfect tests that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of seroprevalence and is usually corrected post-hoc to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use a likelihood-based inference method -previously called mixture models -for the estimation of the seroprevalence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that this likelihood-based method outperforms the methods based on cutoffs and post-hoc corrections leading to less variation in point-estimates of the seroprevalence and its temporal trend. We illustrate how the likelihood-based method can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test's ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the seroprevalence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to identify classes of case sera with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures that have not been used for test validation. An R-package with the likelihood and power analysis functions is provided. Our study advocates to using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods with post-hoc correction at exactly the low seroprevalence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in COVID-19 serosurveys.",

Rather than relying on dichotomized serological test data, i.e. a positive or negative test result for each individual in the cohort, and correcting post-hoc for the test's sensitivity and specificity, this method uses the quantitative test measures together with data on the distribution of these measures in controls and conformed cases. Such quantitative measures differ depending on the diagnostic techniques used. In ELISA-based serological tests, fluorescence is determined in units of optical density or \"arbitrary units\". Tests involving neutralization assays usually report the serum titers needed to achieve viral neutralization of a certain level, e.g. NT50. The method works irrespective of the type of assay that is used, and we refer to the assay results generically as the quantitative test measures.",

We show that, for the expected current seroprevalence of the Coronavirus pandemic and an optimistically high test accuracy of AUC-ROC= 0.95, approximately 150 control and case sera are required to adequately determine the distribution of their test measures that ensure for sufficiently reliable estimates of a seroprevalence. Again, the effort put into test refinement should be carefully weighed against the effort put into mapping the test accuracy thoroughly. Additionally, we provide a procedure to calculate a confidence interval of the estimated seroprevalence that appropriately accounts for the uncertainties arising from the lack of test accuracy as well as the lack of precision in the test measure distributions.",

This issue is crucial for a reliable estimation of the true extent of the current COVID-19 pandemic and still unknown. The likelihood can be easily extended to include more than two types of cases.

This likelihood is formally equivalent to the one presented in van Boven et al [19] , without the age-structure. We used the extended likelihood to estimate the total seroprevalence, the seroprevalence of mild cases and the shape parameter of the distribution of quantitative test measures of the mild case sera.",

We set the mean of the distribution of mild cases always to a lower value than that of the severe cases (see Fig S1) .
