Previous studies have suggested that novices primarily utilize a pathophysiologic analytical (i.e., causal) approach to diagnostic reasoning and rely less on the compare-contrast analytical approach or on pattern recognition, both of which are thought to develop only after trainees begin building robust illness scripts based on clinical experience [11\u201315]. However, the novices in published studies examining diagnostic reasoning approaches have been limited to intermediate (third year or fourth year) medical students, resident physicians, or nonmedical health professions students (e.g., massage therapy students, undergraduate kinesiology students, physical therapy students) [5, 8, 16\u201320]; little is known about the diagnostic reasoning approaches of early, preclinical medical students. Published studies involving preclinical medical students consist of intervention studies reporting results of knowledge-based testing or diagnostic accuracy rather than characterization of how these students formulate their differential or working diagnoses [9, 21\u201324]. Since clinical reasoning curricula now extend into the preclinical years for many medical schools, understanding these learners\u2019 approach to diagnostic reasoning from the beginning of their development is important for both curriculum development and learner assessment in these cognitive skills.",

With this in mind, we developed a collaborative, simulation-based learning activity for our first-year medical students requiring them to integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines in order to problem-solve during a simulated viral pandemic. In this study, we analyzed students\u2019 reports from this learning activity in order to (1) characterize how early preclinical students integrate new and existing knowledge as reflected in their written diagnostic justification tasks and (2) characterize early preclinical students\u2019 diagnostic reasoning approaches to this case.

Concurrently throughout the first year, these students also participated in longitudinal clinical skills, epidemiology, and bioethics courses. Prior to this simulation event, these students had learned how to collect a full history in their longitudinal clinical skills course; this included history-taking skills practice in numerous real and simulated patient encounters in each of the 11 clinical skills class sessions leading up to this event. These students had also participated in 24 sessions of a longitudinal, problem-based learning (PBL) course prior to this simulation event. The PBL course is case based and focused on differential diagnosis formulation using a causal approach, guided by a mnemonic (\u201cVINDICATEM-P\u201d) to systemically consider diseases in each pathophysiological category.

The video clips of frontline clinician reports provided clinical observations about infected patients from the perspectives of an emergency medicine physician, a neurologist, a pathologist, and a critical care physician (videos were 3 to 7 min, each). Links to ethics resources were also provided, including brief descriptions of a list of relevant ethical considerations (e.g., duty to care, fairness, transparency, etc.) as well as a brief video of an ethicist highlighting several ethical issues that have arisen during the simulated pandemic, including acting in patients\u2019 best interest, struggles with resource allocation, challenges in protecting frontline healthcare providers who are at high risk of infection, and mandatory quarantine (though specific strategies for addressing these issues were not provided).",

The second email provided students with electron micrograph images of the mystery pathogen, including captions providing clues to the viral structure.

In addition, previous studies on diagnostic reasoning among medical students indicate these novice learners tend to utilize a causal approach [11\u201315]. However, in our study, only a small proportion of student reports alluded to using a causal approach. These contrasting findings are likely in part due to the fact that most prior studies were conducted on students at more advanced stages of training than that of our learner group.",

Indeed, these students had not yet been exposed to much of the pathophysiology implicated by the signs and symptoms of the patients in the simulated case scenario (excessive bleeding and aggression). Our findings may be explained by the search-inference framework proposed by Aberegg et al., which is not unlike what patients often do to investigate their own symptoms [30]. In this framework, novice problem-solvers\u2014motivated by a specific goal\u2014develop a list of possibilities by seeking their memory or external sources and then use inference to compare and evaluate these possibilities by seeking evidence for and against each one, again using their memory or external sources. The problem-solver then selects the solution mostly likely to satisfy the goal, based on his/her evaluation of the evidence. However, as Aberegg and colleagues point out, such an approach\u2014though practical for the novice\u2014is susceptible to many types of cognitive biases that, left unchecked, could easily lead the clinician astray.",

In fact, understanding and connecting the underlying causal mechanisms to their corresponding clinical manifestations of disease has been shown to be beneficial to the diagnostic reasoning performance of novice learners, with improved long-term memory retention of diagnostic categories and superior diagnostic accuracy when solving difficult cases [5\u20137]. As novices\u2019 biomedical knowledge base continues to expand during their preclinical training, practicing diagnostic reasoning through challenging cases, such as the one presented in our simulated pandemic activity, has benefits for further developing their mental representations of disease. Chamberland and colleagues found that challenging cases appear to activate medical students\u2019 biomedical knowledge by stimulating pathophysiological inferences during self-explanation [18]. Other studies have demonstrated the benefit of self-explanation during diagnostic reasoning, resulting in improved diagnostic accuracy of complex cases, even without receiving feedback on one\u2019s clinical reasoning [17, 31\u201333]. Self-explanation is thought to improve learners\u2019 understanding of the learning material by activating cognitive processes that ultimately strengthen the cognitive connections between elements of the information learned [32].",

More recent studies have shown similar findings, with Google, Wikipedia, and social media being the information-seeking resources most frequently used by contemporary medical students, whereas online journals, scholarly databases, and medical texts are accessed relatively infrequently [37\u201339].
