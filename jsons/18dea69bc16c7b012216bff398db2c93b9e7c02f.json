Objectives: The objectives of this study were to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of the Rivalta test for FIP and to identify correlations between a positive Rivalta test and variables measured in effusion fluid and peripheral blood. Methods: In this retrospective study, medical records of cats with effusions were reviewed, and cats with conclusive results for the Rivalta test were included. The prevalence of FIP in this population was determined, and sensitivity, specificity, and PPV and NPV of the Rivalta test were calculated. Variables measured in effusion fluid and peripheral blood were compared between cats that had positive or negative Rivalta tests using the Mann-Whitney U-test and multivariate analysis. Results: Of 851 cats with effusions, 782 had conclusively positive or negative results for the Rivalta test. A definitive final diagnosis was made in 497 of these cats. Prevalence of FIP in cats with effusion and a conclusive Rivalta test result was 34.6%. The Rivalta test had a sensitivity of 91.3%, specificity of 65.5%, PPV of 58.4%, and NPV of 93.4% for the diagnosis of FIP. These values increased when cats with lymphoma or bacterial infections were excluded, or when only cats 2 years were considered. Increased effusion cholesterol concentration and specific gravity as well as decreased serum albumin:globulin ratio and hyperbilirubinemia were positively correlated with positive Rivalta test results. Conclusions: Sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of the Rivalta test for the diagnosis of FIP were lower than previously reported except when used in young cats. The components in effusions that lead to a positive Rivalta test remain unknown, but the positivity is not simply related to high total protein concentration.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common disease, especially in young cats. Clinical signs are variable, depending on which organs are affected, 1, 2 and it is often difficult to make a definitive diagnosis of FIP, even though there are many tests for evaluating blood and body cavity effusions. 3, 4 In Germany and many other countries, a simple assay termed the Rivalta test has been performed on effusions of cats suspected of having FIP. The test was developed by the Italian physician Fabio Rivalta, who published a report of the method in 1895, to differentiate exudates from transudates in human body cavity effusions. [5] [6] [7] Since then, the Rivalta test has been used mostly in Germany, Poland, Russia, and France. 8 The principle of the test is the formation of a precipitate when a sample of the effusion fluid is added to a solution of acetic acid. The test is inexpensive and can be performed quickly in a private practice setting. The test is no longer used in human medicine, because other analytical methods, including Light's criteria (pleural lactate Vet Clin Pathol 41/4 (2012) 558-567 \u00a92012 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology dehydrogenase [LDH] activity, pleural fluid:serum LDH ratio, and pleural fluid:serum protein ratio), have replaced it. For cats, the test was demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of FIP in 2 previous studies 3, 9 ; however, relatively low numbers of cats were evaluated. 3, 9 In dogs, the Rivalta test has not been demonstrated to have diagnostic value. 10 The objectives of this study were to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the Rivalta test to diagnose FIP in a large cohort of cats with a definitive diagnosis.

It is possible that when FIP is the primary differential diagnosis, cats are See text for definitions of transudates, modified transudates, and exudates based on specific gravity, total protein concentration, and total nucleated cell counts of effusions. and other causes of effusions are rare in such young animals. 30 The PPV of the Rivalta test for FIP was lower than the PPV of 84 or 85% reported in earlier studies 3,9 ; in those studies, cats in which the Rivalta test was positive rarely had diseases other than FIP. 3 In the present study, which included a larger number 31 Predictive values depend on disease prevalence, which may vary considerably from one clinical situation to another. 11, 12 Thus, the lower prevalence of FIP in this study explains the lower PPV of the Rivalta test, but predictive values reported in this study must be interpreted in light of the population evaluated and may not be assigned to other clinical situations. In cats 2 years, the PPV of a positive Rivalta test for FIP reaches approximately 90% owing to the higher prevalence of FIP in this population. 1, 3, [27] [28] [29] Although the sensitivity of the Rivalta test in the diagnosis FIP was also lower than previously reported (98 and 100%), 9, 32 it was still high. In addition, the NPV was also high, indicating that if the Rivalta test is negative, the likelihood of FIP as a cause for the effusion is low. The many significant differences among variables between Rivalta-positive and Rivalta-negative effusions reflected the large number of cats in the study. It was long assumed that a positive Rivalta test would depend on the TP concentration in the effusion 6, [33] [34] [35] ; however, in the present study, neither TP nor globlulin concentrations of Rivalta-positive and Rivaltanegative effusions were significantly different, and high and low TP concentrations were found in both Rivalta-negative and Rivalta-positive effusions. Thus, TP and globulin concentrations appear not to be the major factors correlated with the Rivalta test result, and other components might result in the formation of a precipitate. In a study of human body cavity effusions, several acute phase proteins in Rivalta-positive precipitates could be identified. 36 Therefore, it is possible that some protein fractions, eg, acute phase pro-teins, cause the positive reaction in feline effusions. In this retrospective study, neither electrophoretic analysis nor measurement of acute phase proteins was performed, but these analyses are warranted in a future prospective study. Cholesterol concentration was significantly higher in Rivalta-positive effusions and the OR was highest for this analyte. Cholesterol concentration has been found be useful in differentiating between transudates and exudates in human effusions, [37] [38] [39] possibly because of degeneration of cellular components, eg, WBCs and RBCs, in the fluid or because cholesterol can exit the vasculature due to increased capillary permeability in vasculitis. 38, 40 In the present study, more Rivalta-positive effusions were classified as exudates, and cholesterol concentrations are increased in exudates; thus, cholesterol concentrations may have been higher in these Rivalta-positive effusions. However, it remains unknown whether cholesterol causes or contributes to the precipitate formed in a positive Rivalta test. Interestingly, triglyceride concentrations were lower in Rivalta-positive effusions than in Rivalta-negative effusions. Triglycerides may not follow the same pattern as cholesterol, as it has been shown in mice fed cholesterol that high cholesterol concentrations actually decreased the production of triglycerides. 41 Formation of \"pseudochyle\", which typically contains cholesterol but not triglycerides, 42 can occur in long-standing effusions.
