            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the largest global healthcare crises in nearly a century. The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) crisis started in Wuhan, China in late 2019 1 and has spread worldwide. At the time of writing this paper, there were over 460,000 cases in 199 countries accounting for nearly 21,000 deaths (26 March 2020). 2 It causes clusters of fatal pneumonia. Healthcare workers particularly those exposed to aerosol generating procedures are at risk. Different countries have responded in different ways but social distancing, lockdowns and curfews, self-isolation are common across the world. Singapore instigated contact tracing of confirmed infections, and for health care workers mandatory two weeks leave for anyone who had travelled to the People's Republic of China, compulsory twice-daily temperature testing and a cessation of inter-hospital deployments, which served well in terms of disease containment. 3 Healthcare systems have been stretched to the limit with the building of temporary hospitals for example the NHS Nightingale 4000 bed, 2 morgue hospital at London's ExCel Exhibition Centre an example of how in a time of crisis resources can be mobilised. Companies such as Dyson have converted from manufacturing vacuum cleaners to ventilators in a matter of days. 4 In some quarters, both public and healthcare, there has been a relative dismissal of the severity of COVID-19. The attitude \"it is no worse than seasonal flu\" is common and has led to flouting of social distancing measures. It is only as the virus has taken hold that a more circumspect approach has been taken.",

However, testing is currently restricted to patients who require hospital admission. The majority of healthcare worker are young and healthy, and a significant number have young children. It seems that children are likely to be only mildly affected or asymptomatic carriers. But at this time of year, fever, coryzal symptoms and cough are common among young children, and may result in self-isolation of staff members who would otherwise be keen to return to work. We also know that virus is likely to cause minor symptoms for the majority (more than 80%) of people affected. As mentioned above, many healthcare workers are likely to fall into this category. On the other hand, majority of the patients we treat are frail and vulnerable. We also cannot put those patients at risk if there is doubt about diagnosis. Testing for staff allows them to stay in work, or to remain at home, both of which could be lifesaving at this time. Lessons need to be learnt from Italy in particular, where doctors were not routinely tested, and the death rate among medical personnel is now double that reported in china. Antibody testing is also being developed and is likely to be equally valuable. Testing for healthcare workers will allow return to work earlier at a time the workforce is significantly depleted. The option of deploying NHS staff who have tested positive, and have recovered, if assumed to develop immunity is not just ideal, but likely to become a necessity as the crisis progresses.",
