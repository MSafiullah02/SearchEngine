Approximately 60%\u201380% of HCV infections progress into chronic diseases, including steatosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.1 The standard of care for the treatment for HCV infection include pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), ribavirin, and IFN-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents. The recent use of DAA, including protease inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors, have advanced the efficacy of anti-HCV agents to almost cure for most HCV genotypes.2 However, DAA treatment is not suitable for patients with advanced infection that are with a high risk of liver failure, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, or death.2 In addition, patients with a prior history of hepatocellular carcinoma and who have been treated with DAA for HCV infection have an unexpected high recurrence rate of liver cancer than previously predicted, with the recurrence rate of >40% in some subgroups.3 In addition, the emerging resistance and high cost of DAA treatment is still a high barrier that hinders broad access to patients.4\n",

Drugs targeted at host factors, cellular components, or functions involved in viral life cycle are emerging as new therapeutic options for the management of HCV infection, especially potential agents to be used in combination with DAA.5 For example, small molecule inhibitors that inhibit the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins can suppress replication of HCV, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and coronaviruses.5 Our previous study suggested that heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) binds to the 3\u2032 untranslated region (NTR) and is involved actively in HCV replication.6 Allosteric regulation of the ATPase activity of Hsc70 by tylophorine analogs DCB-3503 and rac-cryptopleurine perturbed translation of HCV RNA, which lead to inhibition of HCV replication.6\nrac-Cryptopleurine analogs exhibited inhibitory activities against several diseases, including cancer,7, 8 arthritis,9 inflammation,10 and dysentery.11 We designed and synthesized a series of E-ring modified rac-cryptopleurine analogs,7, 10 which showed improved anti-cancer activity than the parent compounds.7, 10 We recently reported that tylophorine analog DCB-3503 perturbed translation of HCV RNA via disruption of the replication complex, especially the binding between NS5A, NS5B, HCV RNA, and heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70).6 Despite the potency rac-cryptopleurine exhibited, the selection index of this compound to HCV replication and cytotoxicity is low (IC50/EC50 is only <4 fold, Table 1\n). Modification of the E-ring of rac-cryptopleurine also changed the potency and inhibitory effect on NF-\u03baB, AP-1, and CRE signaling pathways.12 Therefore, modification on the E-ring has the potential to yield compounds with improved pharmacological profiles than rac-cryptopleurine. In this study, we determined the structural-activity relationship (SAR) correlations of E-ring modified rac-cryptopleurine analogs on anti-HCV activity and modulation of chaperone activity of Hsc70, aiming to provide insight into the structures that we could further modify to design new compound(s) having anti HCV activity with decreasing cytotoxicity.",

The modifications include addition of hydroxyl group with different configurations on the E-ring, enlargement of the E-ring, and heteroatom incorporation into the E-ring (Fig. 1\n). The anti-HCV activity was determined in Huh-luc/neo-ET cells harboring the HCV genotype 1b replicon. Among these analogs, compounds YXM-109, YXM-110, and YXM-140 maintained significant anti-HCV activity (EC50 1.4\u20134.9 nM) comparable or only slightly lower than that of rac-cryptopleurine (EC50 0.6 nM) (Table 1). However, the selectivity ratio of HCV activity (EC50) to cytotoxicity (IC50) increased for YXM-109 and YXM-140 (increased IC50/EC50 ratio, Table 1). A change of the 12-hydroxyl moiety from a beta- (YXM-140) to an alpha-orientation (YXM-139) led to significantly decreased anti-HCV activity and cytotoxicity (Table 1). On the other hand, the same change with a 13-hydroxyl group increased anti-HCV activity and cytotoxicity (compare YXM-109 with YXM-110).",

We transiently transfected FLAG-tagged CHIP plasmid or empty vector (EV) to Huh-luc/neo-ET cells with cryptopleurine analog treatment. Expression levels of HCV RNA, NS3 and NS5A proteins were downregulated by rac-cryptopleurine (Fig. 5\nA) or YXM-110 treatment alone (Fig. 5B). Overexpression of CHIP further enhanced the inhibition of HCV RNA, NS3 and NS5A protein levels, while the expression level of FLAG-CHIP was not changed (Fig. 5A and B). These results suggested that stoichiometric regulation of Hsc70 by cryptopleurine analogs was related to their anti-HCV activity.",

Cryptopleurine analogs with different hydroxyl groups (YXM-110, YXM-109, YXM-140) exhibited improved selectivity between anti-HCV activities to cytotoxicity. Analogs with heteroatom modification of the E-ring (YXM-66, YXM-82, and YXM-101) exhibited cytotoxicity, but lost anti-HCV activity. The selectivity of YXM-139 increased compared with rac-cryptopleurine; however, the effects against HCV replication and Hsc70 ATPase promotion were diminished. Changing the size of the E-ring (YXM-142, YXM-93) or heteroatom modification (YXM-82) led to total loss of activity. Among all cryptopleurine analogs, YXM-110 exhibited similar anti-HCV activity and allosteric regulation of the ATPase activity of Hsc70 as rac-cryptopleurine as well as selectivity against HCV but not HBV (Fig. 1). Therefore, in addition to rac-cryptopleurine, YXM-110 could potentially be used alone or in combination with other anti-HCV regimens to high-barrier-to-resistance HCV infection. Tylophorine analogs like rac-cryptopleurine, YXM-110, and DCB-3503 that inhibited proliferation of HepG2 cells could also be used for the treatment of HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.",
