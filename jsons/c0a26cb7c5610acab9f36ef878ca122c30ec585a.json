Furthermore, a recent case reported an asymptomatic COVID-19 patient who retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 despite being discharged after two negative consecutive respiratory nucleic acid tests at least 24 hours apart, raising concern for inadequate discharge protocol. Notably, he was found to have a weakly positive stool sample test during his observation.

Detecting extrapulmonary viral RNA does not necessarily confirm the presence of infectious virions, however, active infection cannot be excluded. Studies have found that viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces occurred even after testing negative by nasopharyngeal swabs, having lasted for approximately seven days 4,5 .

If COVID-19 patients were discharged home or to a nursing home facility based solely on two negative respiratory samples, it could put families, close contacts, and/or health care providers at risk because of the yet unknown full transmission potential of COVID-19. Health care providers should also exercise additional precautions when transferring COVID-19 patients within the hospital or deescalating levels of care. However, with current limitations in the supply of personal protective equipment, prolonged self-isolation may prove beneficial for adequate infection control while conserving resources. The consideration of testing for viral RNA with PCR in fecal samples, in addition to respiratory samples, to confirm recovery of active COVID-19, may offer clinicians guidance as to the duration of isolation precautions for patients upon discharge. 4 What recommendations should clinicians provide patients amidst the COVID-19 pandemic? Those exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms with high probability of COVID-19 infection should practice extended periods of contact precautions for at least 4 weeks, given the data that suggests that viral RNA sheds in feces beyond a month. They should also be educated on contact precautions and preventive measures to minimize fecal-oral transmission until further definitive evidence arises confirming or disproving such a route. Clinicians should emphasize education as a non-invasive means of infection control. Patients should be advised that close contacts are at high risk, and patients may be at risk of re-infection themselves. The World Health Organization recommends effective preventive measures in the community including frequent hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution or soap and water; avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth;",
