            "text": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), pathologically characterized by loss of myelin, oligodendroglial cells, and axonal degeneration [1]. MS is conventionally believed to be an autoimmune disease, mediated by anti-myelin T cells and autoantibodies. Although the etiology is unknown, indirect evidence such as the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) and abnormally increased levels of immunoglobulins (Ig's) in CNS tissue and cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid of MS patients suggest that viral infections play a role in triggering the disease process. Various experimental animal models of virus induced demyelination exist, including the demyelinating strain MHV-A59, and its recombinant demyelinating strain, RSA59 induced demyelination in C57Bl/6 mice [2], [3], [4], [5]. Upon intracranial inoculation, RSA59 causes a biphasic disease that mimics some MS pathology. In the acute phase, RSA59 causes neuroinflammation including meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and sparse demyelination. Myelin loss starts as early as day 5 post-innoculation (p.i.) but reaches its peak by days 25\u201330 (chronic disease phase), when infectious viral particles are below the limit of detection and viral antigen has resolved, but viral RNA persists [2], [6], [7]. Demyelination and axonal loss depend on the viral host-attachment spike protein, as RSMHV2, a closely related isogenic strain that differs from RSA59 only in the spike gene, can cause meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and occasional optic neuritis [8] but is unable to cause demyelination or axonal loss. Thus, spike plays a major role in MHV-induced myelin loss and axonal loss, but it is unknown how differences in spike affect gene expression in order to mediate different host tissue responses. Our recent studies using Affymetrix microarray analysis revealed that RSA59 induces IFN-gamma inducible genes and innate immune-activating pathway genes during the acute stage of infection [9]. Recent studies using a high-throughput RNA\u2013Seq approach also revealed expression of several genes involved in macrophage function, immune infiltration, and changes in cytokine expression levels in response to persistent MHV infection in mice [10].",

Both strains induced hepatitis (score 2\u20133 on a relative scale [11]) (Fig. 1B and C), and mock-infection induced none (score 0) (Fig. 1A). No encephalitis was observed by H&E staining of control mouse brains (Fig. 1D), but there was encephalitis, characterized by activated microglia/macrophages (stained for Iba-1) [12], [13] in olfactory bulb, basal forebrain (Fig. 1E and F), hippocampus, basal pons and deep cerebellar white matter at day 6 p.i. with DM and NDM strains. At day 25 p.i., DM strain induced myelin loss, evident by LFB staining (Fig. 1H), but NDM strain did not (Fig. 1I).

IPA Network analysis of these 22 genes identifies two important pathways: B lymphocyte activation and Ig Class switching. The most striking interactions were observed between CD3, CD45, and MHC-II, which in turn is able to promote B lymphocyte activation and Ig Class switching via CD40 signaling. Similarly, IPA Path designer network analysis demonstrates Ig isotypic molecules overexpressed in DM infection are interconnected in a B cell development network (Fig. 6\n). Because results show significant upregulation of genes involved in B cell development and Ig class switching, antibodies were used to detect proteins produced by specific genes (IgJ, IgA K-chain, IgHA1, Ighg3, IGHM, IgM and IgG) found to be upregulated only in DM strain infection during the chronic phase of infection (day 25 p.i.). Protein levels in CSF, where oligoclonal banding is seen in MS patients, was measured by immunoblotting, but only 10\u201315 \u03bcL of CSF could be collected from the infected mice which was insufficient to detect any binding (data not shown). Proteins levels were also not high enough in whole tissue lysates to detect meaningful expression above background (data not shown).

Results in DM strain infected spinal cord are consistent with prior studies of acute infection [9], with current data showing that most of these genes are upregulated to a similar level, and one to an even greater degree, by NDM strain infection. One possible explanation for the observed induction of innate immune system genes by both viral strains may be an anti-viral immune response, as opposed to being involved in mechanisms of demyelination; that is, observed responses in both strains may reflect host attempts to clear the virus from the CNS after acute infection. Higher levels of innate immune system genes in NDM strain infection, if detected, may provide an explanation for viral persistence of the DM strain, but not the NDM strain, as observed in previous studies [4], [14], [15] and reconfirmed in the current study with viral nucleocapsid specific primer probe set (data not shown). This supposition remains unclear, however, as only one gene (GBP10) was confirmed to be different by RT-PCR between strains, while several proteins (mKC, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12) did show significantly higher upregulation between strains. Cytokine analysis revealed upregulation of IL-12 that also promotes secretion of IFN-\u03b3, itself known for its anti-viral activity and role in viral clearance, supporting the possibility that these genes are induced specifically to control viral replication and infection. In contrast, the absence of significant differences in many other genes that are upregulated by both strains suggests that other mechanisms are likely involved in differential clearance; thus, our current mixed results imply that the degree of innate immune responses may only play a minor role in observed differences in viral clearance.",

Unlike acute innate immune response genes, genes involved in adaptive immune responses are upregulated only during the chronic stage of spinal cord infection, and only in mice infected with the DM strain. Specifically, significant upregulation of Ig genes occurs in the DM strain, and the top canonical pathways whose genes are implicated include the T helper cell signaling pathway, B cell development pathway, and communication between innate and adaptive immune cells. The upregulation of various Ig isotypic genes in DM strain infection only in the chronic phase suggests they may play a role in the chronic stage pathology, including a possible role in demyelination or axonal loss, although future studies will be necessary to determine if these genes are indeed involved in mechanisms of demyelination, or whether their expression merely changes as a consequence of the disease.",

Their presence has been cited as evidence of an infectious etiology [17], [18]. Though the antigenic targets of the IgG's have been difficult to confirm, various studies reported reactivity of intrathecal IgG's from MS patients to several myelin epitopes [19], [20] as well as to oligodendrocytes themselves [21], [22]. The current data is consistent with the possibility that viral infection may trigger CNS demyelination and induce Ig OCBs without leaving any markers to identify the specific underlying infectious agent. B cells can either be primed in the peripheral immune system with subsequent infiltration in the CNS by cytokines like CXCL13 or alternatively, they can be activated and maintained locally in CNS [23], [24], [25]. Histopathological analysis of DM and NDM strain infected mouse spinal cords, as seen in prior studies and again here, is consistent with observed patterns of viral RNA persistence and changes from innate to adaptive immune responses. In NDM strain infection, when infectious viral particles resolve in the chronic stage, activated microglia return to a quiescent stage, but in DM strain infection, viral RNA persists and inflammatory cells also remain in demyelinating plaques [26], [27]. Differences observed here in expression of adaptive immune response genes lead us to hypothesize that persistence of activated microglia/macrophages identified in prior studies may help initiate the adaptive immune response during chronic DM strain infection.",

Several groups have shown that the extent of MHV infection plays a critical role in inducing changes in cytokine expression, and rapid viral growth may suppress lymphocytic responses. While A59 and JHM strains have many similarities, JHM is highly neurovirulent and follows different kinetics of accumulation of virus-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Although activated microglia and macrophages make up the vast majority of early infiltrates, up to day 5 following infection in both strains, T cells are most abundant during peak of the inflammation and thereafter in MHV-JHM, whereas in RSA59 few T cells are present at the peak of inflammation [7], [8], [9], [26]. Thus, it was not clear whether MHV-A59 induced changes in immune response genes would be similar to those found in MHV-JHM infection, yet our current results suggests that there indeed may be similar time courses of innate and adaptive immune responses. Future direct comparisons may be useful to further examine their similarities and differences.",

The potential translation here is enhanced by the fact that the model used mimics many of the histopathological features of MS, and by some published evidence suggesting MS may be triggered by a viral infection [18], [37], [38]. Thus, it might be expected that similar changes in immune regulation as found in our studies could occur in the serum and CSF of MS patients in the early phase of the first attack of demyelination versus subsequent attacks in chronic MS. Thus, understanding the timing and progressive phases of immune responses may indeed lead to identification of potential points to target with both current and novel immunomodulatory therapies.",

Features include inflammatory cell infiltration of CNS predominantly in white matter, demyelination, and truncation and swelling of axons [26], [43]. The best studied virus-induced models of CNS demyelination in mice are the picornavirus TMEV and certain strains of the coronavirus MHV [2], [44], [45], [46], [47]. While these models demonstrate similar histopathology, the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelination probably differs from that in MS, where persistent viral infection of the CNS has not been demonstrated, as is seen with TMEV [44]. In contrast, some neurotropic MHV strains provide models in which viral infection of the CNS is cleared and controlled by remarkably well-defined mechanisms [3], [4], [26]. Notably, MHV encephalitis carries a sequela of inflammatory demyelination in the absence of detectable pathogen gene expression. The elucidation of this apparent \u2018hit and run\u2019 demyelinating event may hold lessons for understanding MS.",

The 40 genes that were differentially expressed in DM strain infection with respect to both NDM strain and mock infection (shown in Fig. 3B) were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software, and were found to be involved in six canonical pathways, including the B cell development pathway. The p-value associated with a Canonical Pathway is a measure of the likelihood that there is significant association between the 40 genes differentially expressed in DM strain infection with the known set of genes involved in that given pathway. The p-value is calculated using the right-tailed Fisher Exact Test. The p-value for a given process annotation is calculated by considering (1) the number of focus genes that participate in that process and (2) the total number of genes that are known to be associated with that process in the selected reference set. The more focus genes involved, the more likely the association is not due to random chance and thus the more significant the p-value. Similarly, the larger the total number of genes known to be associated with the process, the greater the likelihood that an association is due to random chance, and the p-value accordingly becomes less significant. The smaller the p-values are, the less likely that the association is random and the association is more significant. P-values < 0.05 indicate a statistically significant, non-random association and the threshold line representing the p value is 0.05. Canonical pathways are ranked according to their P value and represented as the blue bars. Ratio indicates the number of genes differentially upregulated in our data set that overlap with the particular pathway listed. B.
