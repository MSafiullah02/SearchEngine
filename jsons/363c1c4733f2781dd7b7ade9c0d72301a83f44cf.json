COVID-19-related case fatality is also rapidly increasing. COVID-19 is a new threat for populations [6] [7] [8] , and treatment options need to be evaluated [9] . Early monitoring of key indicators was an important basis to guide treatment strategies, and early assessment of the severity of patients' condition was of great value [10] . The main pathological changes of COVID-19 are lung and immune system damage [4] . Serous, fibrin exudate and clear membrane form in the alveolar cavity and congestion and edema appear in the lung [11] . CT dynamic monitoring may be used to identify the characteristic imaging of lung changes: multiple small patch shadows and stromal changes are observed in the early stage and the lung exudate is obvious [12] , which then develops into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrating shadows in both lungs [13] . CT scan examination, as a quick and simple method to screen for pulmonary infection, cannot only determine the presence of pulmonary infection but it can also provide a reference for determining the type of pathogen, with unique diagnostic advantages. According to Zhong Nanshan's latest research, the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis with CT scan alone was 76.4%, and the application of CT scan in COVID-19 was evaluated as useful [14] . A 50% increase in lung X-ray findings within 24 to 48 hours was considered an early warning indicator of impending conversion to critical disease. The CT scan can sometimes predict the prognosis of patients [15] . Studies by Chen Lin et al. all suggested the value of the CT scan in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19 [2] . Shortcomings of CT scan are the additional special protection required by medical personnel during examination of COVID-19 patients, the cost of protective equipment, and risks associated with the transportation and examination of critical patients.
