Such imposed home confinement restricts the freedom, routines and rhythm of conventional life and involves forced separation from family and friends that causes an increase in uncertainty about the unknown, as well as an overall feeling of loss of control 9 . The fear of stigmatization and financial loss may substantially enhance this emotional distress in the population 9 . Moreover, in today's age of digital information and social networks, the proliferation of fake news and conspiracy theories would contribute even further to increasing worry and social alarm 6 .",

The relationship between adult life events and subsequent 7 onset of psychosis has received little attention by researchers, although meta-analytical evidence suggests around a threefold increase in risk of psychosis in those experiencing stressful events 11 . The presence of these adverse psychosocial factors is also associated with higher frequency in the development of brief psychotic disorders than with schizophrenia or affective psychosis 1 . Along this line, emotional reactivity to stress constitutes the substrate underlying the concept of brief reactive psychosis 1 . Thus, in keeping with stress-diathesis models 12 , the emergence of psychotic symptoms in these individuals with reactive psychosis might be associated not only with the acute stress related to the COVID-19 crisis (which would act as a stressor or state-dependent characteristic) but also with preexisting psychological or biological abnormalities (that would act as susceptibility or trait-like diathesis).",

In this vein, acute stress has been significantly associated with an increase in risk of suicide in persons with short-lived psychotic disorders 13 , and suicidal behavior has also been reported under forced quarantine similar to what we are now experiencing 9 . Therefore, it is paramount to assess suicidal symptoms in this population with brief reactive psychosis, especially in emergency settings where this task can often be passed over because of the rapidly changing psychopathology in such clinical cases 12 .",

Although brief reactive psychoses have traditionally been considered clinical conditions with good prognosis, in almost half of such cases, their evolution over time is toward severe mental disorders, mostly schizophrenia or, to a lesser extent, bipolar disorder 1, 14 . The presence of hallucinations and schizophreniform symptomatology at the onset of psychosis, as well as later relapse, are factors associated with an increased risk of developing chronic psychotic disorders during follow-up 15, 16 . Moreover, long hospitalizations and the prescription of high dosages of antipsychotic medication seem to be predictors of poor prognosis in these short-lived psychotic disorders 17, 18 . It would therefore be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 necessary to prepare preventive approaches and close follow-up of this population with reactive psychosis when the COVID-19 crisis has ended, due to the abovementioned risk of recurrences and transition to long-lasting psychotic disorders of these individuals.",

In the context of home-confinement and concerns about losing his job because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the patient developed a paranoid psychosis in which he believed that his loved ones were being controlled by machines and that the end of the world was coming. The suicide is a 43-year-old divorcee with a previous history of two BPD episodes (both reactive to stressful life events) who was hospitalized due to a new psychotic relapse, this time related to distress caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Her symptoms, disorganized speech and behavior, emotional turmoil, marked irritability and delusions about her family being infected by coronavirus, had an abrupt onset and were triggered as a result of the enforced homeconfinement. The patient was given 30 mg/day aripiprazole and 4 mg/day clonazepam, and her psychotic symptomatology progressively improved until full remission three weeks later.",
