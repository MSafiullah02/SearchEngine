Networks with such intermittent device-to-device contacts are generally called delay-tolerant  [1] or opportunistic  [2]. Until recently, a variety of opportunistic social networks (OSN) have been studied, such as pocket switched networks  [3], publish/subscribe systems  [4], [5], and human contact networks  [6]. Many interesting phenomena have been observed, including the heavy-tailed distribution of contact times and node degree  [7], [8], the small world phenomenon  [9], the dynamics of epidemic spreading  [10], [11], the high clustering of aggregated social contact statistics  [12], etc.",

Therefore, when an infectious disease appears in a population (e.g., the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the H7N9 virus), designing effective immunization strategies has become very important. To achieve this goal, several immunization strategies have been recently developed, ranging from ring immunization  [13] to targeted immunization  [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. The targeted strategy has shown to be more effective than the ring strategy to delay the outbreak of epidemic. The basic idea of targeted immunization is that it first ranks importance of nodes and then removes them, from highest importance to lowest, to observe their impact on epidemic spreading speed. The importance of nodes is generally measured by node\u2019s degree, closeness or betweenness centrality in the network  [19]. To further improve the immunization efficiency, the authors of Ref.  [20] suggested that node importance should be recalculated after every step of node removal.",

            "text": "Previous work mainly concentrates on the global measures of nodes in a network, while ignoring the local importance of nodes in different groups. A number of recent studies indicate that opportunistic networks have a high clustered property  [10], [21] and show a temporal community structure  [22]. Networks with properties at the level of community are quite different from their properties at the entire network level  [23]. Studies thus paying more attention to the whole network topology and neglecting temporal community structure may miss many interesting features. For example, in real world it is found that people have different average number of contacts in different social cliques. The same person in one clique may be sociable, having many contacts with others, while in another clique he/she may be more taciturn. Such contact behaviors have also been seen in opportunistic social networks, where people are more frequently to contact their family or friends, while they meet accidentally with strangers  [24]. If one tried to characterize such a network by statistics of the mean number of contacts a person has, one would be missing the features of the network, such as the dynamics of epidemic, resulting in a biased understanding of the epidemic spreading process. As shown in Fig. 1\n, suppose an infectious disease occurs in a community C1, and unfortunately, Alice is infected. In order to delay the epidemic spreading, Bob should be protected first, because of his close contact to Alice and other people. In this situation, although Carl has a high social status in the whole network, the infectious disease would break out in the community and then spread to the entire network if he was immunized first.",

[14] first studied the targeted immunization strategy and found that immunizing nodes with strong connectivity is more effective than that of randomly selected nodes. Holme et al. considered a more challenging scenario, where only neighborhood information of nodes can be used. They observed that the most efficient strategy is to iteratively immunize the neighbor of nodes with big out-degree  [15]. Subsequently, Zhang et al.  [17] developed a more precise model by taking the immunization willingness of individuals into account. In addition, Schneider  [18] tested the role of node\u2019s betweenness centrality in epidemic spreading, and obtained the similar result.",

This method only characterizes the time-varying network at a coarse-grained level  [12]. Considering these facts, we model an OSN as a Decayed Aggregation Graph DAG=(V,E), where V denotes the set of nodes (|V|=n) and E denotes the set of edges.

We formulate the contact strength between nodes (i.e., the value of wuv(t)) as a Decayed Sum Problem  [34]. Decayed Sum Problem includes two components.

All of them are not applicable, due to the unknown number of neighbors (for degree measure) and vulnerable end-to-end path (for closeness and betweenness measures) in opportunistic social networks. For example, if we use the betweenness to measure node importance, we first need to collect the shortest paths for each node pairs in an offline way, and then count the number of times that each node appears in these shortest paths. Furthermore, the three methods have a bias towards a global measure of nodes.

Replace \u039bk with Eq. (5) and CW with WTW/(n\u22121), respectively, we have WkTWkn\u22121=PkTCWPk\u21d2WkTWkn\u22121=PkTWTWPkn\u22121. Multiply both sides by (n\u22121) and use the substitution of PkTWT=(WPk)T, we get (7)WPk=Wk. Hence, we conclude that the matrix Pk is the projection matrix.Let ci denote the principal direction of the ith eigenvector xi. Based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of Wk   [38], both ci and xi are satisfying: WkWkTci=\u03bbici,WkTWkxi=\u03bbixi. After some algebra, we obtain xi=WkTci/\u03bbi1/2, which shows that elements of xi are the projected values of nodes on the principal direction ci. Hence, |\u03b1ui| is the projection length of node u in community i. \u25a0\n",

We find that the spreading speed of epidemic within one community is faster than that from one community to another. At NCSU, the mean spreading time within one community is 19 min, and 45 min between communities. The SLAW traces show similar phenomena, especially at S(300), where the inter-community spreading time is almost four times of that of intra-community. This is mainly because there exist many small communities at this scenario (as shown in Table 4, the S(300) trace has the most number of communities and the community structure changes dramatically). The small communities are more effective to refrain the epidemic spreading than the big ones. This result is encouraging as it indicates that the outbreak of epidemic could be delayed, if one could break down the OSN traces into lots of small communities by removing some special nodes.",

This conclusion is somewhat inconsistent with our aforementioned results, since some central nodes have relatively low importance in communities and removing them does little damage to the community structure. Therefore, we conjecture that it may be inefficient to suppress the epidemic spreading by removing central nodes. To validate this, we classify nodes into different categories according to their global and local importance. Specifically, we select as High lOcal imporTance nodes (HOT) with the top 10% nodes that have the highest local importance with respect to a community, and the rest as Low lOcal imporTance nodes (LOT). In addition, we define a central node as a node that belongs to the top 10% nodes with the highest importance in the whole network, the remaining nodes are called non-central nodes (similar selection/definition has been used in Ref.  [43]). Our basic idea here is to understand the role of each kind of node in epidemic spreading.",

Fig. 6\npresents the results. The y-axis denotes the immunization efficiency compared to the base case (the case including all nodes), i.e., higher bar means higher efficiency. The first and counter-intuitive phenomenon is that HOT nodes, instead of the central, play a big role in epidemic spreading (as shown in Fig. 6(a)). Compared to removing the central nodes, the immunization efficiency increases 50% on average when the HOT nodes are removed. More interestingly, we observe that non-central HOT nodes are responsible for most of the epidemic spreading in opportunistic social networks (Fig. 6(b) and (c)). Removing them improves the immunization efficiency by 25%\u2013150% at all traces. In contrast, removing central LOT nodes shows a more limited improvement.

Let D(Ci) represent density of community i, we have the following theorem (see Appendix for proof).

Removing in rank order the most important to the least nodes in a community leads to a faster decline in community cohesion. In contrast, removing first the central nodes will shrink the community but with a slower speed. Taken together, HOT nodes appear to be crucial for implementing the immunization strategy, because of their large impact on community structure when removed.",
