Following the virus invasion, antibodies (Abs) are produced after a series of immune signaling and these Abs are able to recognize a diverse array of antigens (Ag) [2]. More specifically, the paratopes (Ag-binding sites) of Abs bind epitopes on virion-associated Ags. During an Ab response, B-cells which express Ag receptors are clonally expanded [3]. Antibodies structurally are composed of heavy (\u03bc, \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5) chains that are linked by disulfide bonds with light chains (\u03ba, \u03bb). In the progress of B-cell development, immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) chain gene recombination typically occurs before immunoglobulin light (IgL) chain gene recombination [4].",

Attachment is the first critical step blocked by Abs by interfering with the virion-receptor binding. Moreover, Abs may induce the aggregation of viral particles which cause a reduction of individual penetration. In post-attachment step, Abs on the virion possibly dampen virus endocytosis internalization leading to the lysosomal degradation. The Abs also block fusion of virion when they intercalate between viruses and cell membrane. The next stage of interference is to uncoat or appropriate intracellular localization of core or capsid. Lastly, Abs might bind virion surface then inhibit the metabolic events that blocks the replication of viruses even after internalization [3,5,6].",

The major challenges related to both sides were previously described: viral antigen and the generation of antibodies to these sites. In the detail, the antigen concerns are (1) epitope masking or shielding by glycans or protein loops; (2) transient exposure during the entry process or via other mechanisms such as viral \u201cbreathing;\u201d (3) the size of conserved epitopes is small resulting in the limitation of interaction, (4) epitopes are constrainedly accessible, (5) the mutability of epitopes. Regarding antibody production, (1) the need for extensive somatic mutations and focused evolution; (2) the use of specific germline allelic variants and HCDR3s of particular length and structure; and (3) the molecular mimicry of host molecules are mentioned [6].",

As these viruses were not very pathogenic and often associated with colds [8], this family of viruses attracted little interest from scientists until the 2000s. In November 2002, SARS-CoV, first reported in Guangdong province, China, became the first highly pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in the human population. This virus was responsible for an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndromes that started in China before spreading rapidly over the world with around 8000 infected people and with a mortality rate of around 10%, depending on patients' age [9]. However, this coronavirus from animal origin was initially unable to use the human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) as receptor [[10], [11], [12]]. It has been suggested that the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) may be an intermediate host in which the viruses have adapted to ultimately infect humans. A recent study suggests that Chinese Horseshoe bats in the family Rhinolophidae may be the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV. One of these two viral isolates in this study, WIV1, was able to recognize the human ACE2 receptor and to replicate in certain human cell lines, suggesting that this virus can directly infect humans without adaptation [13].",

The target epitope of 80R is not conserved in SARS-CoV-2 then it does not affect this novel virus [34]. Another nAb generated from a non-immune scFv library, named 256, could bind to an epitope of RBD but did not inhibit RBD binding. 256 is weak but specific to D480A-muted strains of 80R-escape variants. Some engineered broad nAbs, fm6 and fm39, also showed a high affinity to D480A-muted strains [33]. m396 (epitope aa 482\u2013491) from human antibody fab library was cross-reactive [35] and used the D95 of m396 to form a salt bridge with R395 or an electrostatic interaction with D408 of SARS-CoV RBD [34]. m396 potently neutralized GD03 strain isolated from the second outbreak which resisted neutralization by 80R and S3.1. m396 also neutralized isolates from the first SARS-CoV outbreak (Urbani, Tor2) and from palm civets (SZ3, SZ16) [36]. Another human monoclonal antibody from scFv libraries CR3014 (epitope aa 318\u2013510) showed potent effects on SARS-CoV neutralization; however, this virus can escape CR3014 upon P426L mutation in the S glycoprotein [37].

CR3022, always from scFv libraries, could bind noncompetitively the SARS-CoV RBD (epitope aa 318\u2013510) and had a synergistic neutralizing effect with CR3014 on SARS-CoV, even with the escaped P426L-muted variants [37].",

The weak cross-immunity against SARS-CoV-2 from others betacoronaviruses, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, could restraint the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but a resurgence is possible in the future [103]. Moreover, spike- and non-spike specific CD4+ T cell responses were detectable not only in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients but also in uninfected individuals. If there is an absence of antibody cross-reactivity, T lymphocyte cross-reactivity present in 50% of cases will be responsible for the epidemiological evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection [104].",

But it is not because of this urgency that we can license a vaccine when its benefits and side effects are not clear. Researching a vaccine for influenza viruses, HIV or SARS-CoV-2 is always challenging. Firstly, although the immunogen for protection of a virus, glycoproteins gp120 or gp41 of HIV or S protein of SARS-CoV-2 for example, can be quickly detected, but the immune response needs to be optimized with a good antigen design. Secondly, any drug has side effects immediately or in long-term, directly by the composition of the medication or indirectly by the response of the body to the medication. Pre-clinical experiences with vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are typical examples in aggravating lung disease, either directly or by antibody-dependent enhancement [[116], [117], [118]]. Thirdly, in natural acquired infection, the time point of the detection of nAbs can be easily observed, from 10 to 14 days post-infection in SARS-CoV-2 case for example [119,120], but the potential duration of immunity response is not clear. Therefore, the use of singe-dose or several doses of vaccines needs to be confirmed. Moreover, once a vaccine has been approved, that does not mean that virus research and monitoring can stop. Indeed, influenza and HIV viruses have been reported to have high mutations, making it difficult to find broadly neutralizing vaccines. In the actual pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, drift variants have been reported and that can affect COVID-19 vaccine development [114,115]. No vaccine is available against any coronavirus [121]. Monoclonal antibodies cocktails including multiple epitopes targeting Abs could be taken into account to broaden spectrum of therapy.",
