A new coronavirus, initially named 2019-ncov, was identified as the causative agent of pneumonia. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus \"COVID-19.\" At the same time, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that it was calling the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

SARS-CoV first occurred from November 2002 to June 2003 in Guangdong, China, and spread to many parts of the world. MERS-CoV was found in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Its main outbreak areas were in the Middle East and South Korea, and it occurred occasionally elsewhere.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The dynamics of SARS and MERS have made some progress. At present, there are two main mathematical models of epidemiological dynamics: the deterministic model and the stochastic model. Donnelly et al. (2003) measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients'age and the time from onset to admission. They estimated that the mean incubation period of the disease was 6.4 days, and that the mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic. Lipsitch et al. (2003) estimated that a single infectious case of SARS would infect about three secondary cases in a population that had not yet instituted control measures. Public-health efforts to reduce transmission were expected to have a substantial impact on reducing the size of the epidemic. Riley et al. (2003) analyzed the first 10 weeks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong, and presented that the epidemic was characterized by two large clusters initiated by two separate super-spread events (SSEs) and by ongoing community transmission. Excluding SSEs, they also estimated that 2.7 secondary infections were generated per case on average at the start of the epidemic, with a substantial contribution from hospital transmission. Li et al. (2004) used a logistic deterministic growth model to fit the data of some countries and regions, and some provinces and cities in mainland China, revealing the uneven infectious force of SARS in various regions, along with differences in prevention and control measures. Tan et al. (2003) established the SEIR epidemic model of SARS and a parameter identification system with incubation period and lifelong immunity, and demonstrated the main mathematical properties of the control model and the flow invariance and weak invariance of the system. Li et al. (2013) researched the problem of epidemic spreading dynamics on a multi-relationship network, proposed a kind of dual relationship network model (work-friends network), and studied the effect of multi-relationships on epidemic spread dynamics behavior. They also studied the outbreak threshold of epidemic spreading dynamics on complex networks (Li et al., 2016) , and summarized the similarities and differences of outbreak thresholds between the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models. Kim and Jung (2018) ) studied the dynamic development https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104306 of MERS in the inter-organizational public health emergency management network, and mapped the communication and response network patterns during the outbreak of MERS. Through retrospective epidemiological analysis, Nishiura et al. (2016) ) studied the determinants of the heterogeneous transmission dynamics of the MERS outbreak in South Korea in 2015. They used the transmission tree to identify the super spenders and estimated the reproduction number of different types of hosts, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single major case, and its changes over time. To identify super spreaders in a complex network, Chen et al. (2019) ) proposed a fusion index, called the degree of extension center, by extracting and synthesizing topology feature information of traditional centrality indices and spreading influence to identify nodes, and conducted simulation experiments on four real networks and node removal to verify the accuracy of the proposed centricity. The classical SIR model describes the transmission of infection. People's response to epidemics affects transmission, thus information transmission is also considered often in the literature. Lu and Liu (2019) ) analyzed how the operation of information transmission affects infected individuals and the transmission conditions of epidemics and proposed a susceptibility-recovery-activity (SIR-A) model that maps infection and information transmission to a two-layer network based on the hypothesis that community size and individual consciousness may have an impact on infection rates. Ning et al. (2020) ) used an evolutionary game model of complex networks to study the process of epidemic transmission. Ning et al. selected strategies by assuming that individuals would compare their own benefits with those of neighboring individuals in the process of disease transmission, updated strategies using four simulation principles, analyzed counterintuitive phenomena, and found that simulation principles will affect the scope and severity of counterintuitive phenomena. Through epidemiological SIS investigation involving independent disseminators, Ding et al. (2019) ) explained that complex systems in which the dynamics of diffusion occur often have many underlying relationships that can facilitate the process of infectious disease transmission. Huang et al. (2019) ) studied the impact of human behavior and contact heterogeneity on the spread of infectious diseases. Based on the consideration of fear levels of individuals with different potential contact times with others, a network-based SIRS epidemic model with a general feedback mechanism was proposed. Zhang et al. (2018) ) proposed a novel susceptible-infected-susceptible-recovered-susceptible virus transmission model based on partial immunity and immune inefficiency in complex networks and studied the epidemic dynamics behavior of this model in unified networks and scale-free networks based on mean field theory. Liu et al. (2018) ) simulated an infection transmission process on multiplex contact networks accounting for the natural history of influenza and found that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number was untenable in realistic populations, and it did not provide any conceptual understanding of the epidemic evolution. Based on the complex network theory, Fan et al. (2020) ) established the SEIR dynamic model of 2019-ncov epidemic with incubation period, and predicted the epidemic inflection point through model parameter simulation.Based on Wuhan migration data, Yang et al. (2020) ) estimated the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan by the number of confirmed people and found that the rate of confirmed patients in 15 cities in Hubei province was lower than that in 35 cities outside the province in terms of the mean and median. Lombardi et al.'s research (Lombardi et al., 2020) showed that isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which was presumed through respiratory droplets. A 14 days quarantine was applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases. Fanelli and Piazza (2020) ) analyze the temporal dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China, Italy and France in the time window 22/ 01-15/03/2020. A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple meanfield models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. These scholars studied the propagation rules of SARS and MERS from the aspects of deterministic models, stochastic models, and complex network propagation dynamics, but the propagation research of COVID-19 is just beginning.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 207, "text": "Donnelly et al.

The number of infectious cases is a function of time, expressed as N(t) at time t. When a new coronavirus occurs, people lack full understanding of its origin and route of transmission, which may lead to insufficient recognition of its prevention and control. Therefore, at the beginning, the growth rate of infections can be regarded as a constant r 0 . However, when the number of infected cases reaches a certain level, people will gradually devote increased attention to the epidemic disease and take measures such as disinfection and isolation. At this point, the growth rate of infected people decreases with the increase of their number N, i.e., the growth rate can be expressed as a monotonically decreasing function r(N). For simplicity, let us assume the growth rate r(N) is a linear function of the number of infected people N, r(N) = r 0 \u2212 sN, where r 0 is a constant indicating the growth rate of people doing nothing and letting the virus spread at will, and s is the infection inhibition constant, which reflects the effect of prevention and control measures taken to suppress infectious diseases. The larger s is, the more effective the prevention and control measures are. Moreover, it is assumed that under the combined effect of viral infectivity and prevention and control measures, the maximum number of infected cases is N max , i.e., when N = N max , the growth rate r(N max ) = 0.
