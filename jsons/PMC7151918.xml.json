The long spikes, which consist of the S (spike) glycoprotein, are present on all coronaviruses and give them their characteristic \u201ccorona\u201d appearance. The short spikes, which consist of the HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) glycoprotein, are present in only some coronaviruses.4,\n6, 7, 8 Based on antigenic relationships and genetic homologies, the coronaviruses are subdivided into three antigenic groups.1, 2, 3\n7,\n10 ECV is a member of the group 2 mammalian coronaviruses.7\n",

Virus replication in vivo can be either disseminated, causing systemic infections, or restricted to a few cell types, often the epithelial cells of the respiratory or enteric tracts and macrophages, causing localized infections. Coronavirus replication takes place in the cytoplasm of infected cells.6\n",

Serum antibody titers to coronavirus were evaluated by serum neutralization (SN) test using bovine coronavirus (BCV), which is closely related antigenically to ECV.7,\n14,\n15 Two horses were seropositive for BCV 1 month before transportation (dilution titers 1:10 and 1:40). These horses were transported in the same vehicle as four horses that were seronegative to coronavirus. The four seronegative horses seroconverted after transportation (titers between 1:10 and 1:20 within 1 month), but none developed clinical signs, and a direct relationship between disease and coronavirus infection could not be confirmed.14 This study suggests that ECV may spread among horses while they are stabled together or during transport. This conclusion is consistent with serologic evidence that BCV or its related virus is widely prevalent in horses in Japan.14,\n15\n",

The nucleocapsid has a tubular appearance with helical symmetry. The positive-sense RNA genome is estimated to be 20 to 25 kilobases in length with six open reading frames (ORFs). Four structural proteins have been identified: spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.",
