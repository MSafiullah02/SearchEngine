The technique was developed in Boston under the lead of Edwin Joseph Cohn (1892 Cohn ( -1953 and was made possible through the strong support of the US Department of Navy, the Office of Scientific Research and Development, and the wartime blood donor program of the American Red Cross (Cohn et al. 1944) . Gamma globulin was enriched at high purity in fraction II of the Cohn-Oncley cold ethanol fractionation method (Oncley et al. 1949 ). This \"standard IgG\" at increasing amounts became available from 1943 onward, a time point when the fractionation of albumin has been transferred to industry (Armour Pharma at Kankakee, IL, USA). Indeed, between 1944 and 1948, approximately 1 mio doses of \"standard IgG\" were applied in the USA.",

            "text": "From 1941 onward, therapies with protein concentrates from fractioned plasma were developed under contract between the Office of Scientific Research and Development and Boston Harvard University. Charles A. Janeway (1909 Janeway ( -1981 was put in charge. At that time, he was running the infectious and immunology laboratory at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and was member of the Harvard Medical School Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, and in 1940 he furthermore joined the laboratory of Edwin J. Cohn in the Harvard Medical School Department of Physical Chemistry (Geha 2005; Rosen and Janeway 1994) . After initial studies in 1941 in humans with bovine (fatal outcomes) and human serum albumin (successful), in 1943 he turned to study Cohn fraction II (+III), the plasma fraction(s) enriched in IgG. The initial studies largely remained restricted to the prevention or attenuation of viral infections, particularly of measles infections (Ordman et al. 1944) . The initial restriction to viral diseases probably was because from the late 1930s onward, the dawn of antibiotic treatment, Janeway built up an outstanding expertise in the treatment of bacterial infections with these emerging new drugs (Smith 1977) . The first human ever receiving an IgG concentrate was Janeway himself-with almost fatal consequences as the lot was contaminated with bacterial toxin (Rosen and Janeway 1994) . Aiming for rapid increase of antibodies in the circulation and pursuing the \"tradition\" set, the \"lot-release\" for intravenous application of toxin free preparations was a self-infusion to one or the other collaborators of Janeway. Repeated severe and one almost fatal adverse event let Janeway note: \"One mystery about normal serum gamma globulin which has defied explanation is its toxicity on intravenous injection. Although reactions have been practically nonexistent on intramuscular injection for measles prophylaxis, intravenous injection of the most highly purified preparations into normals in moderate doses and into patients ill with acute infections in much smaller doses has led to acute vasomotor reactions followed by severe chills and hyperpyrexia. This has occurred so regularly that one wonders whether it has genuine physiologic significance\" (cited from Janeway 1948). Therefore, intravenous application of \"standard IgG\" was given up in favor of the intramuscular route.",

Applying plasma electrophoresis to the serum of an 8-year-old boy, he realized an association between recurrent severe infections (starting at an age of four and a half years of age) and a very low gamma globulin in serum. In an attempt to reduce susceptibility to infections, he administered \"standard IgG\" subcutaneously and demonstrated an increase of gamma globulin in blood, clinically a decrease of infections. Some remarkable facts of Bruton's work have to be highlighted: (a) despite the overwhelming position of the Boston group, he selected the less painful subcutaneous route of administration for his young patient; (b) he detected a new disease; and (c) he provided the therapy. Although less painful, at that time, only low doses of \"standard IgG\" could be administered via this route, and the need for i.v. preparations allowing administration of larger doses became evident (again).",

This activation process generated anaphylatoxins like C3a and C5a and caused acute intolerance reactions if \"standard IgG\" was given intravenously. Thus, from the beginning of the 1960s onward, research focused on the reduction of aggregates as the cause of anticomplementary activity (ACA) in order to create preparations that were tolerated upon intravenous use.

However, keeping these goals in mind the different companies intensified their research heading for products that came as close to these requirements as possible. After a one and half decade of development, the first \"native\" 7S IgG concentrate came to the market in Switzerland: Ig-SRC (SRC = Swiss Red Cross). The clue to reach intravenous tolerability was the polishing of \"standard IgG\" at low pH and traces of pepsin. This step rendered remaining aggregates ineffective. Other manufacturers applied other techniques to get rid of IgG aggregates or to render them non-complement activating. Much progress in polishing steps was made leading to different products with lyophilized or liquid formulation needing different stabilizers (Cherin et al. 2016 ).",

Back in the early 1940s, an elevated risk for \"homologous serum jaundice\" was associated with the use of pooled serum (for stabilizing yellow fever vaccine). The same was true for the first product prepared from pooled plasma, albumin (Spurling et al. 1946) . Great efforts made already in 1945 available a virus inactivation method for albumin concentrates, pasteurization at 60 \u00b0C for 10 h (Gelli et al. 1948 ).

It became apparent that Cohn fractionation II of human plasma alone was limited in its capacity to inactivate transmissible viruses while products remained free from the threat of virus transmission, particularly those prepared by the Kistler-Nitschmann fractionation technique, most likely due to the low pH applied at polishing. Several patients infected by HCV experienced a severe course of infection and a few died (Bj\u00f6rkander et al. 1988; Razvi et al. 2001 ) making viral safety a crucial issue for IgG products (Cuthbertson et al. 1987) . Driven by the virus transmission risks of blood transfusion and the obvious elevated risk of virus transmission by coagulation factor concentrates, authorities always orient themselves to the highest risk level and require accordingly measures to guarantee product safety. IgG therapy on one hand comprises a particular set of risks, while on the other hand the fractionation technique and the polishing steps offer particular opportunities for virus inactivation/removal.

S.c. products are increasingly studied in chronic autoimmune/inflammatory conditions, e.g., chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), and various dermatological and collagen-vascular diseases. Results from clinical trials will be available soon. Whether or not ITP can be treated by s.c. route remains to be clarified.
