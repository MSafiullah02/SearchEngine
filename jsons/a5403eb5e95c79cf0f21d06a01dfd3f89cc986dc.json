The time it takes to produce a comprehensive echocardiogram, and the difficulty in decontaminating a full ultrasound platform needed to produce it, are likely to only increase the risk of sonographer infection further. While the visual and quantitative fidelity of comprehensive echocardiography is far superior, we believe that the information gathered in COVID-19 patients should be balanced against the risk produced by increased contact time and ultrasound platform contamination. We hypothesized that a handheld ultrasound platform utilized for a bedside limited echocardiogram would provide a safe, practical and adequate diagnostic alternative to standard echocardiography in these patients.

However, in the unique circumstances produced by the pandemic the advantages of the handheld device, it may be argued, thoroughly outweighed its limitations. Even the use of ultrasound enhancing agents injected with the tablet set to reduced output power was possible when indicated (Figure 1 ). Tablet based ultrasound proved sufficient to guide pericardiocentesis in the catheterization laboratory in a suspected COVID-19 patient with cardiac tamponade.

During this pandemic, ordering of diagnostic testing on COVID-19 positive patients is likely done with more prudence out of concern for staff. This may have led to less repeat echocardiograms in the COVID-19 population as compared to the control group. In facilities without proper integration of handheld ultrasound equipment to a PACS system a similar protocol may not be feasible. In the absence of the urgency produced by the pandemic, we would have preferred to study more patients, collect more data, and perform a validation study comparing tablet based and comprehensive echocardiograms on the same patients.",

These echocardiograms were performed using a traditional platform (Philips EPIQ, Philips IE33, Andover MA)(GE Vivid E9, Chicago IL) per guideline protocols. 7 For both the control and test group, the following variables were recorded: exam indication, length of exam, estimated ejection fraction, presence or absence of wall motion abnormalities, moderate or greater mitral regurgitation, presence or absence of pericardial effusion, and the occurrence of a follow up transthoracic echocardiogram. Variables were determined by review of the final clinical report. Missing interpretive fields or those deemed inadequately visualized for interpretation were categorized as such. Imaging time and number of clips were abstracted from review of the echo images including time stamps to identify time elapsed between first and last clip. Time spent in the patient's room and decontamination time were obtained by averaging time spent with 10 patients (5 per group).",

Further, the time required for the disinfection of a traditional sonograph in our study was 30\u00b13.5min, compared to 4\u00b10.9min for completing sterilization on the handheld system. The patients receiving UEA had a longer average imaging time of 9\u00b15min.Regarding echocardiographic findings, of those who had a limited handheld echocardiogram 80 (89%) had interpretations including the presence (n=22, 28%) or absence (n=58, 72%) of wall motion abnormalities. Ten interpretations (11%) did not comment on wall motion compared to 12% in the standard echocardiography group. In the limited handheld group all patients had color Dopplerperformed except 4 patients (4%) who had echocardiograms for function only at the request of the provider. In those 86 patients performed with color Doppler, there was assessment of the severity of mitral regurgitation in 80 (93%) while the control group included assessment of mitral valve function in all cases (p=0.012).
