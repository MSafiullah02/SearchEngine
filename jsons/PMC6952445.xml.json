            "text": "Colorectal cancer is a worldwide health problem. It is the 3rd most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the world and is also one of leading causes of cancer death1. Laparoscopic colectomy was introduced in 19912. Initially, it was not widely accepted for cancer treatment because of technical difficulties such as working in multiple intra-abdominal quadrants, ligation of vessels and re-establishment of intestinal continuity as well as oncological concerns including retrieval of lymph nodes, surgical resection margin and survival results3. These controversies gradually settled with the accumulation of experience and advance in technology. Through medial-to-lateral approach, the difficulty of multi-quadrant working was lessened. New energy devices such as bipolar sealers and ultrasonic shears made ligation of vessels easier. For oncologic concerns, laparoscopic colectomy was accepted as an alternative surgical approach for colon cancer after positive outcomes from several multi-center prospective randomized trials (RCTs)4\u20138. Since then, further evidence has accumulated to support the feasibility, safety, and benefits of the laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer9\u201311.",

It has been reported that hospital volume, surgeon volume, and the rate of laparoscopic surgery may affect the outcome of colorectal surgery. Higher hospital and surgeon volume and higher laparoscopy rates are generally associated with better outcomes after laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer15,16. In our study, the proportion of laparoscopic left-sided colon cancer resection was similar among hospitals of various statuses, indicating the high penetrance of this procedure. Under such circumstances, surgery performed in medical centers was associated with significantly lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes than surgery performed in metropolitan hospitals. This observation indicated that hospital volume and capability remained a significant determinant of clinical outcomes after colon cancer surgery.",

In our previous study, we demonstrated that patients undergoing open surgery for transverse colon cancer had higher risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation dependence, and hospitalization for pneumonia as compared to patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery14. The difference was attributed to the longer incision placed in the upper abdomen in the open surgery. In surgery for left-sided, especially the sigmoid colon cancer, the incisions were placed over the middle and lower abdomen for both open and laparoscopic procedures. The two groups of patients were also comparable with regard to the rates of underlying chronic pulmonary disease. Therefore the difference might be explained mainly in the size of the wounds. The consequence of larger wounds was also evident from the increased opioid usage in the group of open surgery. Both pain and the subsequent increased use of opioid may increase the risk of pulmonary complications26.",
