Even with the advent of laboratory automation and the integration of genomics and proteomics in microbiology, interpretation of results still depends on the quality of the specimens received for analysis. Prokaryotic microorganisms, while genetically less complex than multicellular eukaryotes, are uniquely suited to adapt to environments where antibiotics and host responses apply pressures that encourage their survival. A laboratory instrument may or may not detect those mutations, so a specialist in microbiology is needed to facilitate microbiology laboratory result interpretation. Clearly, all microbes grow, multiply, and die very quickly.

The microbiology laboratory needs a specimen that has been appropriately selected, collected, and transported to the laboratory for analysis. Caught in the middle, between the physician and laboratory, are those who select and collect the specimen and who may not know or understand what the physician or the laboratory needs to do their work.

This document illustrates this partnership and emphasizes the importance of appropriate specimen management to clinical relevance of the results.

Many body sites have normal microbiota that can easily contaminate the specimen. Therefore, specimens from sites such as lower respiratory tract (sputum), nasal sinuses, superficial wounds, fistulae, and others require care in collection. 4 . The laboratory requires a specimen, not a swab of a specimen. Actual tissue, aspirates, and fluids are always specimens of choice, especially from surgery. A swab is not the specimen of choice for many specimens because swabs pick up extraneous microbes, hold extremely small volumes of the specimen (0.05 mL), make it difficult to get bacteria or fungi away from the swab fibers and onto media, and the inoculum from the swab is often not uniform across several different agar plates. Swabs are expected from nasopharyngeal and viral respiratory infections. Flocked swabs have become a valuable tool for specimen collection and have been shown to be more effective than Dacron, rayon, and cotton swabs in many situations. The flocked nature of the swab allows for more efficient release of contents for evaluation. 5 . The laboratory must follow its procedure manual or face legal challenges. These manuals are usually supported by the literature. 6 . A specimen should be collected prior to administration of antibiotics. Once antibiotics have been started, the flora changes, leading to potentially misleading culture results. 7 . Susceptibility testing should be performed on clinically significant isolates, not on all microorganisms recovered in culture. 8 . Microbiology laboratory results that are reported should be accurate, significant, and clinically relevant. 9 . The laboratory should be allowed to set technical policy; this is not the purview of the medical staff. Good communication and mutual respect will lead to collaborative policies. 10 . Specimens must be labeled accurately and completely so that interpretation of results will be reliable. Labels such as \"eye\" and \"wound\" are not helpful to the interpretation of results without more specific site and clinical information (eg, dog bite wound right forefinger).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 293, "end": 294, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1114, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1247, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1428, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1559, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1671, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1855, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Tenets of Specimen Management"}, {"text": "The microbiology laboratory policy manual should be available at all times for all medical staff to review or consult and it would be particularly helpful to encourage the nursing staff to review the specimen collection and management portion of the manual.

Cultures for aerobic bacteria and detection of Chlamydia and viruses either by culture or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) are most commonly performed.

Appropriate transport media should be provided by the laboratory and available at the collection site for specimens submitted for Chlamydia and/or viral culture or NAAT [26] . Specimens for viral cultures should be submitted on ice, especially if specimen transport is prolonged. Specimens obtained from either the surface or the globe of the eye are almost always collected by ophthalmologists. Specimen types include swabs of ulcers, corneal scrapings, biopsies, or anterior chamber or vitreous aspirates. The volume of specimens is always limited. This specimen limitation makes it necessary for the laboratory to prioritize procedures depending on what organisms are sought, and this should always be done after discussion with the ophthalmologist who collects the specimen and the infectious disease consultant when appropriate. This is particularly important because all major pathogen groups-viruses, parasites, bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungican cause ocular infection. Both epidemiology and clinical presentation are used to narrow the organism(s) sought and the laboratory tests requested. Because of the limited specimen size seen with scrapings and biopsies, the laboratory and ophthalmologist may agree to inoculate these specimens onto media and prepare smears at the bedside.

The comparison of intraocular antibody levels in aqueous humor to that in serum has been found to be a useful means for diagnosing ocular toxoplasmosis but because the specimen needed for testing can only be obtained by a highly invasive procedure, it is unlikely that this technique will be used outside the research setting [54] .

These vary in terms of sensitivity and ease of use; the specific test employed will dictate the swab transport system used. In pediatric patients, if the direct antigen test is negative, and if the direct antigen test is known to have a sensitivity of <80%, a second throat swab should be examined by a more sensitive direct NAAT or by culture as a means of arbitrating possible false negative direct antigen test results [78] .

A convenient means of facilitating this two-step algorithm of testing for Streptococcus pyogenes in pediatric patients is to collect a dual swab initially, recognizing that the second swab will be discarded if the direct antigen test is positive. b Direct NAATs for Streptococcus pyogenes are more sensitive than direct antigen tests and, as a result, negative direct NAAT results do not have to be arbitrated by a secondary test.

Table VI-3 lists the organisms most commonly associated with pneumonia in the immunocompromised patient. Two diagnostic strategies have been recommended by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [92] . The clinical strategy is based on the presence of a new lung infiltrate plus the presence of 2 of 3 clinical features (fever, leukocytosis or leucopenia, and purulent secretions) [92] . Determining the cause of the pneumonia relies on initial Gram stain and semiquantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates or sputum. A smear lacking inflammatory cells and a culture absent of potential pathogens have a very high negative predictive value. Cultures of endotracheal aspirates, while likely to contain the true pathogen, also consistently grow more mixtures of species of bacteria than specimens obtained by bronchoscopic techniques. This may lead to additional unnecessary antibiotic therapy. The bacteriologic strategy uses quantitative cultures of lower respiratory tract secretions obtained either bronchoscopically or via endotracheal aspiration without a bronchoscope [92] . Quantities of bacterial growth above a threshold are diagnostic of pneumonia and quantities below that threshold are more consistent with colonization. The generally accepted thresholds are as follows: Endotracheal aspirates, 10 6 CFU/mL; BAL, 10 4 CFU/mL; protected specimen brush samples (PSB), 10 3 CFU/mL.

Table VI-4 summarizes the major pathogens. Any significant accumulation of fluid in the pleural space should be sampled by thoracentesis. Specimens should be hand carried immediately to the laboratory or placed into appropriate anaerobic transport media for transport. In some institutions, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles has become an established practice. This is acceptable providing that the manufacturer's guidelines are followed with respect to the volume inoculated and whether supplementation is required to enhance recovery of fastidious pathogens such as S. pneumoniae. If blood culture bottles are used, an additional sample should be sent to the microbiology laboratory for Gram stain and culture of nonbacterial pathogens when indicated. Fluid should be sent for cell count, pH, protein, glucose, and . These values assist with the determination of a transudative or exudative process and in the subsequent management of the syndrome. For example, the following parameters suggest the need for drainage: pH <7.28; glucose <40 mg/dL; LDH >1000 IU/L or the presence of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) [94] . Most infections result in an exudate or PMNs (empyema) within the pleural cavity. When tuberculosis or a fungal pathogen is thought to be the likely cause, a pleural biopsy sent for culture and histopathology increases the diagnostic sensitivity. Always notify the laboratory of a suspicion of tuberculosis so that appropriate safety precautions can be employed. An elevated adenosine deaminase level in the pleural fluid (>70 IU/L) in a patient with appropriate risk factors for tuberculosis has been shown to have a high sensitivity in high prevalence regions. A level <40 IU/L excludes the diagnosis. This marker of lymphocyte differentiation should be used in conjunction with hematologic and chemical parameters and other diagnostic tests such as NAAT, culture, and histology of a pleural biopsy.

A limited number of organisms have been implicated in chronic infections (Table VI-5) . Early in childhood, infections are caused by organisms frequently seen in the non-CF pediatric population such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus. At some point later in childhood or adolescence, P. aeruginosa becomes the most important pathogen involved in chronic lung infection and the concomitant lung destruction that follows. The P. aeruginosa strains adapt to the hypoxic stress of the retained mucoid secretions by converting to a biofilm mode of growth (mucoid colonies). Nosocomial pathogens such as S. maltophilia and Achromobacter xylosoxidans may be acquired during a hospital or clinic visit. Burkholderia cepacia complex is a very important pathogen in these patients. B. cepacia genomovar III (B. cenocepacia) is highly pathogenic and is responsible for rapid decline and death in a subset of patients who acquire the virulent clones. Special microbiological techniques are required to recover and differentiate B. cepacia complex from the mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. Less common gram-negative organisms that appear to be increasing in their frequency of recovery, but whose role in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease is still unclear, include B. gladioli, Ralstonia spp, Cupriavidus spp, and Pandorea [96] . As CF patients have survived into adulthood, opportunistic pathogens such as nontuberculous mycobacteria have been isolated with increasing frequency. There is evidence to suggest that both M. abscessus and M. avium complex contribute to lung destruction and should be treated when cultures are repeatedly positive. Mycobacterial culture should be added to the routine cultures obtained from patients older than 15 years of age who present with exacerbations, as the incidence of Mycobacterium species is likely underestimated due to failure to routinely assess patients for these organisms [96] . Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common fungus recovered from CF patients where it causes primarily allergic bronchopulmonary disease. Scedosporium apiospermum may cause a similar syndrome.

Culturing only urines that have tested positive for pyuria, either with a dipstick test for leukocyte esterase or other indicators of PMNs may increase the likelihood of a positive culture, but occasionally samples yielding positive screening tests yield negative culture results and vice versa [160] . The Gram stain is not the appropriate method to detect PMNs in urine but it can be ordered as an option for detection of high numbers of gram-negative rods when a patient is suspected of suffering from urosepsis.

Cultures of Foley catheter tips are of no clinical value and will be rejected. Collection of specimens from urinary diversions such as ileal loops is also discouraged because of the propensity of these locations to be chronically colonized. Chronic nephrostomy collections and bagged urine collections are also of questionable value.

Testing in special populations, such as pregnant patients, children and men who have sex with men (MSM) are noted where applicable but readers are referred to the more comprehensive guidelines referenced. There is considerable overlap in symptoms and signs for many genital infections and clinical diagnosis alone is neither sensitive nor specific. Thus, diagnostic testing is recommended for the following reasons: appropriate treatment can be focused, specific diagnosis has the benefit of increasing therapeutic compliance by the patient and the patient is more likely to comply with partner notification [167] . Providers should also recognize that despite diagnostic testing, 25%-40% of the causes of genital infections or symptoms may not be specifically identified, and that many infections are acquired from an asymptomatic partner unaware of their infection. In fact, patients who seem to \"fail\" therapy and continue to exhibit symptoms and/or have positive tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are most likely to have been re-infected by their sexual partner [168, 169] . Thus referral for partners for specific testing and treatment is essential to prevent re-infection and is especially true for patients who may be pregnant. Finally, because the vast majority of genital infections are STIs and communicable, they are a public health concern and patients and providers should note that positive tests for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC), syphilis, chancroid, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) require reporting in accordance with state and local statutory requirements by the laboratory and/or the provider.

For instance, while NAATs are the most sensitive, especially where suboptimal collection, or nonulcerative or vesicular lesions may be present, there may be limitations as to specimen source acceptable and patient age depending on the NAAT used. Culture is more likely to be positive in patients that have vesicular versus ulcerative lesions, specimens obtained from a first episodic lesion versus a recurrent lesion, and specimens from immunosuppressed patients rather than immunocompetent.

If a nontreponemal test is being used as the screening test, it should be confirmed, as a high percentage of false positive results occur in many medical conditions unrelated to syphilis.

This approach has introduced complexities in test interpretation that did not exist with the traditional sequence [174] . Specifically, screening with a treponemal test sometimes identifies persons who are reactive to the treponemal test but nonreactive to the nontreponemal test. No formal recommendations exist regarding how such results derived from this new testing sequence should be interpreted, or how patients with such results should be managed. To begin an assessment of how clinical laboratories are addressing this concern, CDC reviewed the testing algorithms used and the test interpretations provided in four laboratories in New York City [174] . Substantial variation was found in the testing strategies used, which might lead to confusion about appropriate patient management. A total of 3664 (3%) of 116 822 specimens had test results (ie, reactive treponemal test result and nonreactive nontreponemal test result) that would not have been identified by the traditional testing algorithms, which obviate additional testing if the nontreponemal test result is nonreactive.

However, the mode of transmission and/or acquisition is not necessarily that of an STI for BV or VVC, but it is for TV. A number of point-of-care tests (POCTs) can be performed from a vaginal discharge specimen while the patient is in the healthcare setting. Although POCTs are popular, the sensitivity and specificity of POCTs for making a specific diagnosis varies widely and these assays, while rapid, are often diagnostically poor. Some of the tests include a pH strip test, scored Gram stain for BV, wet mount for TV, and 10% KOH microscopic examinations for VVC. For BV, use of clinical criteria (Amsel's diagnostic criteria) is equal to a scored Gram stain of vaginal discharge. However, a scored Gram stain is more specific than probe hybridization and POCT tests (that only detect the presence of G. vaginalis as the hallmark organisms for altered vaginal flora). For VVC and TV the presence of pseudohyphae and motile trichomonads, respectively, allows a diagnosis. However, proficiency in microscopic examination is essential given that infections may be mixed and/or present with atypical manifestations. Unfortunately consistent microscopic exam of vaginal specimens and interpretation are difficult for many laboratories to perform and wide variation of sensitivities (40%-70%) for both TV and CVV using smear exam exists relative to NAAT and culture, respectively.

Infections of the skin and soft tissue are often classified as primary pyodermas, infections associated with underlying conditions of the skin, and necrotizing infections. Representative primary cutaneous infections of the skin include cellulitis, ecthyma, impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, and erysipelas and are commonly caused by a narrow spectrum of pyogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus pyogenes [Group A streptococcus]). Secondary infections are often extensions of pre-existing lesions (traumatic or surgical wounds, ulcers) which serve as the primary portal of entry for microbial pathogens and are often polymicrobial (mixed aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms) involving subcutaneous tissue. Diabetic foot infections (DFI) typically originate in a wound, secondary to a neuropathic ulceration. Anaerobic bacteria are important and predominant pathogens in DFI and should always be considered in choosing therapeutic options. The majority of DFIs are polymicrobial but grampositive cocci, specifically staphylococci, are the most common infectious agents.

Images are used to direct procedures that are performed with needles or other tiny instruments (eg catheters). Infections as a result of such procedures are rare but should be considered when evaluating a patient who has undergone interventional radiology which constitutes a risk factor for infection due to the invasive nature of the procedure. A variety of drainage devices are used to remove blood, serum, lymph, urine, pus and other fluids that accumulate in the wound bed following a procedure, (eg, fluids from deep wounds, intracorporeal cavities, or intraabdominal postoperative abscess). They are commonly used following abdominal, cardiothoracic, neurosurgery, orthopedic and breast surgery. Chest and abdominal drains are also used in trauma patients.

Throughout this section, the term NAAT generally refers to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR. Other specific techniques may be substituted with appropriate validation. [215] . Of note, tick-borne disease caused by Rickettsia parkeri is emerging; this organism has a similar clinical presentation as ATBF and MSF with fever, headache, eschars, and regional lymphadenopathy [217] . b Organisms are best detected in blood while a patient is febrile. With subsequent febrile epidsodes, the number of circulating spirochetes decreases. Even during initial episodes, organisms are seen only 70% of the time. c Special media and technical expertise is required for culture of Borrelia species that cause relapsing fever. A centrifugation-based enrichment method followed by Giemsa staining is a rapid and viable approach [218] . d Not valuable for an immediate diagnosis, however, serologic testing is available through public health and some private laboratories. An acute serum (obtained within 7 days of the onset of symptoms) and convalescent serum (obtained at least 21 days after the onset of symptoms) should be submitted for testing. Of significance, early antibiotic treatment can blunt the antibody response and antibody levels may fall quickly during the months after exposure. e To date, 18 genomic species are reported in the literature, three are confirmed agents of localized, disseminated and late manifestations of Lyme disease and are listed in the table. Another 9 species have been described with possible pathogenic potential [219] . A \"chronic\" or \"post\" Lyme disease syndrome after initial short-course antibiotic treatment has not been supported in a rigorous scientific study. Treatment of \"chronic Lyme disease\" is a controversial issue that has been addressed by IDSA in a guideline available on its website (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full#sec-36). f Erythema migrans (EM) is the only manifestation of Lyme disease in the United States that is sufficiently distinctive to allow clinical diagnosis in the absence of laboratory confirmation. Positive culture rates for secondary EM lesions, primary EM lesions, and large volume (\u22659 mL) blood or plasma specimens are 90%, 60%, and 48%, respectively [220] . If skin is biopsied, more than 1 biopsy sample should be taken for culture due to uneven distribution of spirochetes; disinfect the skin prior to collection and submit tissues in sterile saline. Culture is rarely performed outside of research settings. [221, 223] . Although Borrelia can be detected by NAAT in blood, biopsy specimens of infected skin, synovial tissue or fluid, or CSF, its usefulness for the diagnosis of Lyme disease is limited at this time. For example, Borrelia DNA is detected in the blood of fewer than half of patients in the early acute stage of disease when the erythema migrans rash is present, and if symptoms of Lyme disease have been present for a month or more, spirochetes can no longer be found in blood. Similarly, NAAT testing of CSF specimens is positive in only about one-third of US patients with early neuroborreliosis, and is even less sensitive in patients with late neurologic disease. The utility of testing synovial fluid and other specimen types is not well established and should be considered only under special circumstances and skin biopsy is not generally recommended because patients with erythema migrans can be reasonably diagnosed and treated on the basis of history and clinical signs alone. j Communication with the laboratory is of paramount importance when ehrlichiosis is suspected to ensure that Wright-stained peripheral blood smears will be carefully examined for intracytoplasmic inclusions (morulae) in either monocytes or neutrophils or bands. k A newly discovered Ehrlichia species was reported to cause ehrlichiosis in Minnesota and Wisconsin; this Ehrlichia is closely related to Ehrlichia muris [224] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 545, "end": 550, "text": "[215]", "ref_id": "BIBREF221"}, {"start": 749, "end": 754, "text": "[217]", "ref_id": "BIBREF223"}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1196, "text": "[218]", "ref_id": "BIBREF224"}, {"start": 1917, "end": 1922, "text": "[219]", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 2615, "end": 2620, "text": "[220]", "ref_id": "BIBREF226"}, {"start": 2876, "end": 2881, "text": "[221,", "ref_id": "BIBREF227"}, {"start": 2882, "end": 2886, "text": "223]", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 4287, "end": 4292, "text": "[224]", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "XIII.

Because of the time course of test positivity and the possibility of seronegativity, the laboratory diagnosis of primary (acute) HIV-1 infection is usually based on a high quantitative HIV-1 RNA (viral load) result (typically >10 5 copies/mL), or qualitative detection of HIV-1 RNA and/or proviral DNA; (Table XIV-1) [227] . Outside of the setting of acute HIV infection however, HIV viral load assays should be used with caution for diagnosis of HIV infection because of the possibility of false positive results.

Combined HIV antibody plus p24 assays (ie, fourth generation assays) are in widespread use as initial screening assays and the Association of Public Health Laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommend them as initial screening tests for diagnosis of HIV infection [225, 226] . The testing algorithm associated with their use does not require Western Blot. Instead, individuals with reactive results are further tested with an antibody immunoassay that distinguishes HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies. If the differentiation assay is negative, further testing with a qualitative or quantitative NAAT is recommended to rule out acute HIV-1 infection. If the differentiation assay is positive, viral load testing (and usually also CD4 determination) is recommended to direct management. An alternate approach is an initial HIV antigen/ antibody combination assay that discriminates detection of antigen from antibody; p24 reactivity is subsequently confirmed by NAAT and antibody reactivity by an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation assay. The traditional laboratory diagnosis of nonacute HIV-1 infection (Table XIV-1) begins with screening for HIV-1/-2 antibodies. When testing by the screening assay shows reactive results, confirmatory testing by Western blot is performed. (As an alternative, NAAT testing or a second antibody immunoassay-using different antigenic constituents or based on different principles-may be considered.) An initial positive HIV antibody immunoassay using an oral fluid specimen is followed by an immunoassay performed on blood, serum or plasma, a positive result of which is followed by NAAT or supplemental antibody testing to corroborate infection. A negative blood, serum or plasma result requires follow-up testing as previously described [225, 226] . Using the traditional algorithm, if the Western blot result is positive, the patient is considered to be infected with HIV-1. If negative, testing for HIV-2 antibodies is recommended to rule out the possibility of HIV-2 infection causing the reactive combined HIV-1/-2 antibody result. If the Western blot test is unreadable (ie, due to high background reactivity of the strip), testing with an HIV-1 antibodyspecific indirect immunofluorescence assay or qualitative or quantitative testing for HIV-1 RNA or for proviral DNA should be considered. According to Association of Public Health Laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an HIV-1 antibody Western blot result is interpreted as positive when at least 2 of the 3 following bands are present: p24, gp41, and gp120/gp160. If only one of these bands is present, the result is indeterminate, and additional supplemental testing with an HIV-1 antibody-specific indirect immunofluorescence assay, an EIA for HIV-2 antibodies alone, and a qualitative HIV-1 RNA and/or proviral DNA assay should be considered. Causes of indeterminate Western blots include evolving antibody profiles, specimen contamination, antibody decline with immune system failure (late stage infection), nonspecific reactivity due to viral or cellular protein components, other infections (eg, syphilis, other retroviruses, some parasites), immune-modulating conditions (eg, pregnancy), and infection with groups N, O, or P HIV-1, or HIV-2. High-risk patients with reactive serologic screening test results and indeterminate Western blots but negative supplemental tests should be considered for retesting two to four weeks later. If this does not resolve the issue, additional supplemental testing (eg, NAAT) may be considered. Western blot assay is less sensitive than third or fourth generation EIAs during seroconversion with up to three weeks following a positive fourth generation assay before a positive Western blot assay. Since as many as a third of healthy HIV-uninfected blood donors have indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot assays, they should not be ordered as the first test for HIV.

Positive ELISA results are considered evidence of active infection and would exclude potential blood/tissue donors who test positive from acting as donors, since the infection has been shown to be transmitted by transfusion and transplantation. A somewhat unusual situation has developed for serologic testing for American trypanosomiasis where the FDA has approved two commercial assays for blood or organ donor screening and a different commercial assay for patient diagnostic testing. Each assay cannot be used for the nonapproved purpose even though they are supposed to be detecting the same antibodies. An ELISA (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ) and an automated method (Abbott Prism Chagas, Abbott Park, IL) have been approved for blood, organ, cell, and tissue donor screening whereas a different ELISA test (Hemagen Diagnostics, Columbia, Md) is approved for diagnostic testing. Donor screening test positives may be tested by an FDA approved supplemental test (ABBOTT ESA Chagas) and/or submitted to a reference laboratory for confirmatory testing by a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA). The Hemagen assay measures IgG and does not require confirmatory testing.

Serologic testing represents the most common method for diagnosis of dengue infection. An acute-phase serum specimen should be collected within five days after onset of fever. Patients in the early stage of dengue fever virus infection may not have detectable IgG antibodies; IgG antibodies typically take at least six days after onset of symptoms to develop. IgG antibodies to dengue may persist for decades. If a negative test result is reported for a patient for whom dengue fever is strongly suspected, a second serum specimen should be drawn 7 to 10 days after disease onset and tested for IgM and IgG antibodies. While detection of dengue IgM may indicate recent infection, seroconversion of dengue IgG should also be demonstrated to confirm the diagnosis. Tests for anti-dengue antibodies may detect antibodies to other flaviviruses, including West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. Molecular testing for dengue virus is available upon special request from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and selected reference laboratories.N.
