M. pneumoniae pneumonia is typically mild and characterized by a persistent dry cough or self-limiting pneumonia that resolves with no medication [3]. However, respiratory failure and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occur in 0.5\u20132% of all M. pneumoniae pneumonia cases and primarily affect young adults [4\u201318]. The rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission of hospitalized M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients are reported as 10% in the US and 16.3% in Europe [19, 20]. The rate of ICU admission is even higher at 38.8% in patients older than 65 years, compared to 18% in patients older than 19 years [20]. In one retrospective study from our hospital, 4.1% of M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients needed ICU admission for acute respiratory failure in the setting of an epidemic [21].",

Case reports have also described using new forms of respiratory support for M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS, such as high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) [26], non-invasive ventilation (NIV) [27] and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [18, 24, 28].

Respiratory failure occurred a median of 9 days (range, 3 to 15 days) after onset of symptoms, similar to the previous descriptions [3, 29]. However, these clinical features are not specific for early recognition and diagnosis of severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Therefore, early and precise laboratory detection of M. pneumoniae infection is essential to prevent deterioration. Previous methods, such as mycoplasma culture and serological tests, which may require several weeks, are not practical. As presented in our study, early definitive diagnosis is now dependent on PCR or mNGS [25], which had high specificity and sensitivity. Thus, further development of these relatively new diagnostic tools is warranted, and should be applied in cases of severe CAP induced ARDS with suspected M. pneumoniae infection.",

Similar findings were also reported in a previous case report [24].

As ARDS is a clinical syndrome with many different causes and may induced by some less common pathogens, mNGS is used in our ICU for early detection of possible unknown etiology, and we found that mNGS had a good value in diagnosis for M. pneumoniae in our cases. However, in most cases mNGS is more appropriate to be used for patients with unknown etiology, and may not be suitable for routine examination of some common pathogens such as ADV, RSV, and M. pneumoniae. Thus, once commercial PCR kits are available for diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection, it is not necessary to detect M. pneumoniae using mNGS as a primary option.",

The isolated macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae were resistant to erythromycin, and also showed cross-resistance to clarithromycin and azithromycin. All isolates were sensitive to tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. Moxifloxacin was more active than ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin [33]. However, sequencing of macrolide resistance genes is not a routine test in clinical practice in our centers, and we did not perform sequencing for macrolide resistance genes in our cases.

However, two cases deteriorated to severe hypoxia despite anti-mycoplasmal therapy and invasive ventilation, eventually requiring ECMO support. In a recent case report and literature review for use of ECMO in M. pneumoniae associated ARDS, the mean ECMO run was 232 h/9.68 days [28], similar to that of our cases. The overall survival rate for 22 cases of M. pneumoniae requiring ECMO with reported outcome was 72.7%(16/22), demonstrating that ECMO may be safely and effectively used to treat severe ARDS caused by M. pneumoniae infection [28].",

However, in our study, we did not observe significant increases of cell or humoral immunity as demonstrated by T cell subset cell count or immunoglobulin levels in more severe disease. Most interestingly, we found that with appropriate respiratory support and anti-mycoplasmal therapy, all patients had a rapid clinical improvement. Therefore, no corticosteroids were given, and all patients finally recovered from ARDS without corticosteroid use. Prolonged or inappropriate use of corticosteroids may cause excess downregulation of cell-medicated immunity and result in immunosuppression, making individuals more susceptible to more severe M. pneumoniae infection or opportunistic infections. A recent case report revealed that M. pneumoniae associated ARDS had no elevated pulmonary vascular permeability, and was successfully treated using low-dose short-term hydrocortisone, suggesting that pulmonary infiltration in ARDS caused by M. pneumoniae does not match the criteria of permeability edema observed in typical ARDS [35]. Therefore, careful consideration is required when deciding whether to use high dose corticosteroid in the future cases similar to ours.",
