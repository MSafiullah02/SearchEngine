Antibodies to S. neurona were identified in 10 of 196 (5%) cats in Michigan for which sera were submitted for T. gondii testing.\n10\n Stanek et al\n11\n reported that 10% of cats presented to a mobile spay and neuter clinic had circulating antibodies to S. neurona. When feral cats on an equine farm known to have EPM were sampled, the prevalence was 40%. While these data support that a low to moderate percentage of domestic cats may have circulating antibodies to S. neurona, neurologic disease is rarely reported. Only 2 cases of clinical disease associated with Sarcocystis sp. in domestic cats have been reported to date. S. neurona encephalomyelitis was reported in a 4\u2010month\u2010old cat following routine castration.\n12\n In addition, Sarcocystis sp.\u2010associated meningoencephalitis was documented in a 3\u2010month\u2010old kitten after a history of trauma and in a Canada lynx.\n7\n, \n13\n In the latter cases, speciation was not performed; therefore, either S. neurona or S. felis could have been responsible for the infection.",

Further, the feeding of encysted armadillo muscle to opossums results in sporocysts identified as S. neurona.\n15\n Therefore, based on the high genetic similarity between these 2 species, the geographic restrictions of this case, and the known involvement of the domestic cat in the life cycle of S. neurona, clinical disease in this cat was attributed to S. neurona.",

Serologic cross\u2010reactivity may also exist between the classes of apicomplexan protozoans. Although rare, false positives to IFA\u2010IgG for T. gondii have been reported in S. felis\u2010infected cats.\n17\n Electron microscopy may provide an accurate diagnosis provided enough protozoal structures are intact. Specifically, the absence of rhoptries in merozoites and division by endopolygeny can differentiate Sarcocystis sp. from T. gondii.\n18\n Electron microscopy was not performed in this case due to a limited quantity of sample.",

With regards to Sarcocystis sp. the primers derived from the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (ssurRNA [JD26/JD37]) amplify the S. felis gene as well those of other species, thus requiring sequencing of the product for analysis. However, the ssurRNA gene sequence is highly conserved among Sarcocystis sp. and even sequencing may not allow for reliable differentiation. Primer pair JNB25/JD396, which amplifies a genomic fragment of unknown function,\n16\n does not amplify S. felis DNA; however, it does amplify DNA from the closely related species S. neurona and Sarcocystis falcatula\n\n8\n, \n19\n which may then be differentiated.",

However, when aligned with Sarcocystis partial gene sequences in the database and with published sequences not deposited in the database,\n14\n this difference was not definitive. Better speciation was then sought by comparing the ITS\u20101 sequence using the primer pair JD26/JD37, as this region in S. felis shares only 45% and 46% identity with S. neurona and S. falcatula, respectively.\n8\n Two clones of the ITS\u20101 region from the feline parasite shared 45% identity with S. felis and 99\u2013100% and 95\u2013100% identity with S. dasypi and S. neurona, respectively. Therefore, clinical disease was not due to S. felis and instead was the result of S. dasypi or S. neurona infection.
