One of the most important approaches adopted in antiviral therapy is the use of interferon inducers [2], [3]. Agents capable of stimulating interferon production range from viruses and bacterial cell walls to synthetic compounds or biopolymers [4] along with a small group of low-molecular-weight compounds (Fig. 1\n). Some of the compounds which have been reported to induce interferon include N,N-dioctadecyl-N\u2032,N\u2032-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)propanediamine 1\n[5], N,N\u2032-dihexadecyl-m-xylylenediamine 2\n[6], bis(diethy1amino)fluorenone (3, tilorone) [7], 1,5-bis[[(diethylamino)ethyl]amino]-9,10-anthraquinone 4\n[8] and nucleobase derived 9-benzyl-8-hydroxyadenines 5\n[9].",

Subsequent studies have demonstrated that the analogue of ABMP, 6-phenylpyrimidinones does not possess this toxicity and exhibits enhanced interferon-inducing antiviral potency and activity [12]. Further biological evaluation of an initial lead candidate in this second-generation pyrimidinone series, 2-amino-5-bromo-6-phenyl-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 7, revealed an intriguing spectrum of immunomodulatory activity which may be related to its antiviral [13] and antitumour activity [14]. In the present study, a highly regioselective and efficacious protocol to prepare C-6 elaborated 2-amino-5-bromo-4(3H)-pyrimidinones required for the elucidation of the structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) in this pyrimidinone series has been reported. In addition, a rather elaborated antiviral assay of this series of new compounds along with examination of their cytotoxicity has been carried out.",

In CRFK cell cultures, compound 14h presented activity against Feline Herpes Virus at a concentration well below its cellular toxicity threshold (Table S1, entry 3). However, none of the compounds presented any activity against HSV-1, HSV-2, vaccinia virus and VSV in HEL cell cultures (Table S1, entry 4). Compounds 14b, 14c, 14f and 14i possessing, respectively, a n-butyl, n-pentyl, 4-ClC6H4CH(OH)CH2 and 3,4-(OCH3)2C6H3CHCH substituents at C-6 positions showed activity against VSV in HeLa cell cultures with EC50 values of 10, 45, 45 and 45 \u03bcM, respectively. Although, compound 14c with an n-pentyl substituent at the C-6 position had presented pronounced antiviral activity (EC50 = 2 \u03bc\u039c), it was close to its toxicity threshold (Table S1, entry 5). Furthermore, the anti-VSV activity was not observed in HEL cell cultures, in which the toxicity of the compound was also lower. In Vero cell cultures, none of the compounds showed any activity against parainfluenza virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4 and Punta Toro virus (Table S1, entry 6). In MDCK cell cultures, all the compounds were found to be inactive against influenza virus (Table S1, entry 7).",

IR was recorded on FTIR Shimadzu 8400 Fourier-transform spectrophotometer in the range of 400\u20134000 cm\u22121 using KBr. The melting points were determined in open capillaries and were not corrected. For monitoring the progress of a reaction and for comparison purpose, thin layer chromatography was performed on pre-coated aluminium sheets (Merck; 60F254, 0.2 mm) using an appropriate solvent system. The chromatograms were visualized under UV light. For column chromatography silica gel (60\u2013120 mesh) was employed and the eluents were ethyl acetate/hexane mixtures.",

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or 100 or 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (for CMV or VZV, respectively) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds.
