            "text": "Humanity is facing an increasing number of highly virulent and communicable diseases such as influenza. Combating such global diseases requires in-depth knowledge of their epidemiology. The only practical method for discovering global epidemiological knowledge and identifying prophylactic strategies is simulation. However, several interrelated factors, including increasing model complexity, stochastic nature of diseases, and short analysis timeframes render exhaustive analysis an infeasible task. An effective approach to alleviate the aforementioned issues and enable efficient epidemiological analysis is to manually steer bio-simulations to scenarios of interest. Selective steering preserves causality, inter-dependencies, and stochastic characteristics in the model better than ''seeding'', i.e., manually setting simulation state. Accordingly, we have developed a novel Eco-modeling and bio-simulation environment called SEARUMS. The bio-simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS permits a human-in-the-loop to steer the simulation to scenarios of interest so that epidemics can be effectively modeled and analyzed. This article discusses mathematical principles underlying SEARUMS along with its software architecture and design. In addition, the article also presents the bio-simulations and multi-faceted case studies conducted using SEARUMS to elucidate its ability to forecast timelines, epicenters, and socio-economic impacts of epidemics. Currently, the primary emphasis of SEARUMS is to ease global epidemiological analysis of avian influenza. However, the methodology is sufficiently generic and it can be adapted for other epidemiological analysis required to effectively combat various diseases.",

Despite numerous advances in epidemiology and medicine many of these diseases, particularly zoonotic diseases, continue to defy human efforts to treat and control them (Flint et al. 2004 ). The source of such resistance to treatment and control is twofold. First, the incessant evolutionary processes such as genetic reassortment, recombination, and mutation induce changes to organisms, thereby constantly morphing their antigenic characteristics (Russell et al. 2008) . Second, the vectors of the diseases, such as birds and animals, often disperse the pathogens over wide areas (Hagemeijer and Mundkur 2006; Normile 2006) . The scenario is further convoluted due to complicated symbiotic processes between the vectors and other organisms including humans. Rapid changes in phylogeny and bio-diversity pose significant challenges in vaccine manufacturing (WHO 2007a) . In addition, socio-political restrictions and technological limitations further magnify the challenges involved in controlling intercontinental spread of infectious diseases (WHO 2007a) .",

One of the most powerful and widely used approaches for such an analysis is computerbased simulation. Simulations have gained significant importance epidemiology because they are the only practical approach to analyze large and complex epidemiological models (Epstein 2009; Ferguson et al. 2006; Halloran et al. 2008; Longini et al. 2005; Rao and Chernyakhovsky 2008) . Furthermore, the need to conduct a variety of multi-faceted analysis within short time frames necessitates the use of computer-based simulations. Moreover, simulation is a cost effective and non-destructive methodology from which results can be easily displayed in an intuitive form. More importantly, it enables effective explorations of policies and procedures associated with complicated control measures, such as: targeted layered containment [the main concept behind US government's containment strategies (Halloran et al. 2008) ], quarantine, social distancing, school closing, and targeted antiviral prophylaxis (Epstein 2009; Ferguson et al. 2006; Longini et al. 2005; Rao et al. 2007a ).",

One strategy is to seed the simulation, i.e., manually initialize the state to appropriately model the scenario being analyzed. However, such an approach is typically tedious, cumbersome, and error prone. Moreover, in stochastic models, accurately capturing temporal, causal relationships (Lamport 1978) between entities in the model can prove to be a greater challenge. These issues often lead to conspicuous inefficiencies when multiple scenarios have to be analyzed. An alternative approach is to commence simulations in a given, verified initial state and then steer the simulations to desired scenarios of interest. Strategies for steering simulations can be broadly classified into three main categories, namely: automatic, semi-automatic, and manual steering. Note that this taxonomy is based on the degree of human involvement in the steering process.",

Such HITL epidemiological biosimulations enable efficient generation of various scenarios to be analyzed. In addition, this approach preserves the causal inter-dependencies in a stochastic model. Moreover, simulating from a validated initial state minimizes modeling errors and reduces continued verification efforts. Last but not the least, HITL steering enables some degree of adaptation and modeling of unplanned or unanticipated scenarios that could occur in emergent epidemics.

Currently, SEARUMS is geared for analyzing the global epidemiology of avian influenza, with migrating waterfowl as the primary vectors for intercontinental spread of the disease. However, the methodology is sufficiently generic and can be easily adapted for other diseases. Accordingly, this chapter elucidates the modeling, HITL-simulation, and software design principles underlying SEARUMS so that the concepts can be readily adapted and applied to other diseases as well. Furthermore, SEARUMS is envisioned to serve as a global, multi-disciplinary environment that seamlessly integrates knowledge from various fields so that epidemiologists, economists, and disease control centers can collaboratively use it to combat global epidemics.",

The ecological interactions contributing to the transcontinental spread of the disease is illustrated in Fig. 8 .2. As shown in the figure, infected migrating waterfowl, in which the virus is endemic, are the primary vectors for causing intercontinental spread of the disease (Normile 2006) . The virus rapidly spreads from waterfowl to poultry and humans through contaminated water, feed, feces, and surfaces. Once infected, the disease has a devastating impact on poultry farms causing 100% mortality within 48 h (WHO 2007b) . In humans, the virus causes disease with a high mortality rate of nearly 60% (CDC 2006; Normile 2006) . Furthermore, it is known to induce primary viral pneumonia in the host (Normile 2006) . Researchers believe that avian influenza has significant potential to become one of the deadliest pandemics in human history (CDC 2006; WHO 2006c) . This inference has been drawn based on statistics from recent epizootic outbreaks and the highly pathogenic characteristics of H5N1. Moreover, manufacturing and distribution of vaccinations is facing multifaceted challenges (WHO 2007a). The aforementioned issues make it imperative the epidemiology of avian influenza is thoroughly analyzed in order to empower various national and international organizations with the knowledge to strategically combat the disease (Anderson and May 1992; Epstein 2009; Ferguson et al. 2006; Longini et al. 2005; GLiPHA 2007; Rao et al. 2009 ).",

A Markov process consists of a number of states (or values) through which the system may transition at any given time. Mathematically, a Markov process is defined as a sequence of time dependent random variables X 0 , X 1 , X 2 , ..., where X t is a random variable that describes the state of the process at discrete time t. The initial or starting state of the system is typically represented by X 0 . Transitions from one state to another are governed by the following three laws: (1) a Markov process may be in only one given state at any instant of time; (2) transition from one state to another occurs instantaneously in discrete time steps; and (3) the next state to which the process transitions is purely determined by the current state of the system and not its past. In other words, the past, present, and future states of a Markov process are independent of each other (Winston 1994) .",

First, such an approach is necessary to reduce the size and complexity of the model to more tractable scales. Aggregated models continue to provide the necessary fidelity as long as the aggregation is performed at a sufficiently fine granularity (Law et al. 2005) . Second, various real-world statistical data on population dynamics, seasonal migratory behaviors, and disease progresses are determined through random sampling of a large subset of the population. Such data is more meaningful and relatively straightforward to apply at an aggregate level. In our software system the three primary aggregate entities, namely: (1) flock of waterfowl; (2) poultry; and (3) group of humans have been modeled using the aforementioned Eco-modeling approach. The Markov processes have been suitably implemented using the modeling framework provided by SEARUMS. The Markov process for the waterfowl entity is shown in Fig. 8.3 .

During its inception, simulations were run purely as an offline or batch processing task without requiring any interaction with a human operator. However, the growing demand and diversification in needs in various disciplines have led to the development of simulations which involve interactions with a human operator (Rao et al. 2007b ). Such simulations, which permit or require a human to interact, are classified as HITL-simulations. The process of impacting the state of the simulation to divert the simulation to another state is called simulation steering. Simulation steering is similar to program steering, which is a more generic concept (Gu et al. 1994) .",

The batch mode is useful for The modules and subsystems constituting SEARUMS cooperatively operate on a shared, in-memory representation of the model called the Eco-description. The Eco-description is a centralized data structure that includes all the information necessary for modeling, simulation, and analysis.

As shown in Table 8 .1, our model includes the complete human population (approximately 6.646 billion) humans represented by 1,314 agents. On an average, each human agent models 5.058 million humans living in a contiguous circular region. However, the precise population represented by an agent varies depending on the density of the region it models. Agents modeling dense metropolitan areas have higher human populations while agents modeling rural areas of the world have lower population. In contrast, the radius of all the human agents in the model is equal. The radius was computed using the grid size of gridded human population data from SEDAC (2007).",

The Eco-description was interactively calibrated by suitably tuning the following attributes: start date for simulation, initial infection percentage, intra-flock disease spread rate, and inter-flock transmission mechanism. Note that we calibrated only the attributes that were indirectly derived from published statistics. We established validity of the Eco-description and SEARUMS by confirming that the timing and chronology of several outbreaks observed in the simulations correlate with the significant real-world incidents reported (WHO 2006a) as shown in Table 8 .2.",

The study was conducted using a number of bio-simulations with three different experimental groups of migrating waterfowl. The three flocks were chosen based on their close proximity to known primary sites of disease outbreaks (Rao et al. 2009 ). The initial infection in each experimental group was varied for analysis. Figure 8 .6 illustrates one of the trans-Atlantic transmission pathways to the continental US. We observed that the spread was determined by migratory pathways and timelines of different species of waterfowl rather than initial infection percentages (Rao et al. 2009 ). One of the interesting observations is that our experiments correctly predicted an outbreak in the UK (WHO 2006c). The graph in Fig. 8 .7 presents the impact of avian influenza outbreaks on poultry population in the continental US. Decrease in poultry population corresponds to H5N1 induced death and culling of birds to control the disease. Increase in poultry The data was recorded after the model was calibrated population reflects regeneration of poultry flocks after an outbreak. As illustrated by the graph, infections in poultry also follow a cyclic pattern that correlate with annual migration of waterfowl. The mortality figures can be translated to corresponding dollar figures for financial analysis. Additional case studies and experiments conducted using SEARUMS are discussed in the literature (Rao et al. 2009 ).",

As discussed in Sect. 8.1, epidemiology is a vital discipline with far reaching impacts on human health and economics. Specifically, the article discussed the conceptual mathematical models (refer to Sects. 8.2.1 and 8.2.3) and their implementation in a custom Eco-modeling and HITL bio-simulation environment called SEARUMS. The article also discussed the software architecture of SEARUMS and its design in Sect. 8.3. The procedure involved in utilizing SEARUMS for Eco-modeling and model calibration using HITL-simulation steering was discussed in Sect. 8.4. HITLsimulation steering played a vital role in enabling calibration of the model. The HITL infrastructure was developed because conventional approaches for suitably seeding the model were unsuccessful despite hundreds of attempts and simulation runs. Furthermore, the ability to create checkpoints using the HITL infrastructure enabled rapid analysis of various scenarios. The Eco-modeling and HITL-simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS has been used to model and analyze the global epidemiology of avian influenza. It must be noted that, even though the current emphasis of SEARUMS is on avian influenza, the underlying conceptual models and the software infrastructure are generic. Consequently, the concepts and software tools can be adapted for epidemiological analysis.",

It can be used to analyze other scenarios such as those simulated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (2006) . SEARUMS and our Eco-description provide an excellent foundation for further enhancements. Note that use of SEARUMS does not require any special computing infrastructure or programming knowledge. Consequently, experts from multiple domains can collaboratively use SEARUMS to perform various types of analysis on a global scale, assess threats, and measure effectiveness of countermeasures. Our methodology and HITL-simulation environment will enable mankind to strategically invest precious time and resources to combat avian influenza, minimize its impacts on human life and global economy thereby averting a pandemic.",
