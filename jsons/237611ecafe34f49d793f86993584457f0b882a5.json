            "text": "COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and over 3.3 million people worldwide have been infected as of May 1, 2020. Although most cases of COVID-19 are mild, disease can be severe resulting in hospitalization, respiratory failure, or death 1 . Early reports from Wuhan showed that 2-10% of COVID-19 patients had gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including diarrhea but a recent meta-analysis reported that up to 20% had GI symptoms [2] [3] [4] [5] . Studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 virus in anal swabs and stool samples in almost 50% of COVID-19 patients, suggesting that the digestive tract might be an extra-pulmonary site for virus replication and activity 6, 7 . Moreover, fecal calprotectin were found to be elevated in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea 8 , an indicator of inflammatory responses in the gut. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the host and this receptor is highly expressed in both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract 9, 10, 11 . ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and gut microbial ecology 12 . With trillions of diverse bacteria dwelling in our gut, the gut microbiome has a myriad of effects on gene regulation of immune response and metabolism. The commensal microbiota ecosystem in the gut is dynamic and can be regulated by invading viruses to facilitate a stimulatory or suppressive response 13 . Studies have shown that respiratory viral infections may be associated with altered gut microbiome, which predispose patients to secondary bacterial infections 14, 15 . Recent meta-transcriptome sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed that the microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was dominated by pathogens or oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria 16 . In addition, co-morbidities commonly associated with severe COVID-19 are known to be associated with alterations in bacteria taxa from the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes [17] [18] [19] [20] , which were reported to regulate ACE2 expression in rodents 21 . There is an urgent need to understand host microbial perturbations that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may impact response to infection and efficacy of various future immune interventions, such as vaccines 22 .",

Libraries were subsequently sequenced on our in-house sequencer Illumina NextSeq 550 (150bp paired-end) at Center for microbiota research, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

A total of 23 bacterial taxa were found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity, most of which (15 out of 23) were from the Firmicutes phylum (Table 3) Three bacterial members from the Firmicutes phylum, the genus Coprobacillus, the species Clostridium ramosum and Clostridium hathewayi, were the top bacteria positively associated with COVID-19 disease severity (Spearman correlation coefficient Rho>0.9, p<0.01, Table   3 ). Both Clostridium ramosum and Clostridium hathewayi have been associated with human infection and bacteremia 27, 29 . Importantly, Coprobacillus bacterium has been shown to strongly up-regulate colonic expression of ACE2 in the murine gut 21 . In contrast, two beneficial species Alistipes onderdonkii and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were top bacterial species to show a negative correlation with COVID-19 severity ( Table 3) . Alistipes species are indole positive, involved in the serotonin precursor tryptophan metabolism and in maintaining gut immune homeostasis 30, 31 , while Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has antiinflammatory properties 32 . Although we cannot assign a causative or preventive role of these bacteria in disease pathogenesis or severity, our data underscore a potential role for bacteria in determining response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and intensity of the infection in the host.",

Recently, a study provided direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to human ACE2 as host entry point 9 . ACE2 is highly expressed in the intestine especially in colonocytes of healthy subjects and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease 10 , and can regulate amino acid transport, microbial ecology and inflammation in the gut 12 (Figure 4) . Among them, Bacteroides dorei has been reported to suppress colonic ACE2 expression 21 and to calibrate host immune response 39, 40 . The highest SARS-CoV-2 mortality and morbidity has been reported in older patients and in those with underlying chronic diseases that are associated with inflammation such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease [41] [42] [43] . Interestingly, these subjects were also reported to have a lower abundance of Bacteroides species than healthy individuals [17] [18] [19] [20] . These findings altogether suggest that an individual's gut microbiome configuration may affect the subject's susceptibility and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Although assigning a causative relationship between COVID-19 and gut dysbiosis requires larger validation studies, this pilot study presents the first data to examine the influence of SARS-CoV2 infection on gut microbiome composition and dynamics. We attempted to adjust for factors, such as age, gender, therapy, comorbidities, which may explain the observed variance in the data. As we included only hospitalized patients with moderate/severe disease, such findings may not be generalizable to all COVID-19 cases, including those with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. Stool collected after hospitalization for microbiome analysis does not represent the bona fide baseline microbiome at COVID-19 onset, nor the baseline microbiome before disease onset. Further studies should prospectively include asymptomatic subjects, and if infected with SARS-CoV-2, followed up at disease onset, during disease course, and long term after discovery to delineate the role of microbiome changes in SARS-CoV-2 infection and post-infection recovery.",

SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by two consecutive RT-PCR test targeting different regions of the RdRp gene performed by the local hospital and Public Health Laboratory Service. Pneumonia controls were patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 PCR on two respiratory samples. COVID-19 patients and pneumonia controls were admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital or the United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong. Healthy controls were individuals with no past medical history or history of antibiotic intake in the past 3 months recruited via advertisement from the general population and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. All subjects were recruited between Feb 5 and Mar 17, 2020. Severity of COVID-19 infection was categorized as (i) mild, if there was no radiographic evidence of pneumonia; (ii) moderate, if pneumonia was present along with fever and respiratory tract symptoms ; (iii) severe, if respiratory rate \u226530/min, oxygen saturation \u226493% when breathing ambient air, or PaO 2 / FiO 2 \u2264 300 mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133 kPa); or (iv) critical, if there was respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or organ failure requiring intensive care 23 . This study was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committees (2020.076). All patients provided informed consent to participate in this study. Data including demographics, laboratory results, imaging results and medical therapy were extracted from the electronic medical records in the Hong Kong Hospital Authority clinical management system. Fecal samples from COVID-19 patients were collected serially 2-3 times per week until discharge. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.",
