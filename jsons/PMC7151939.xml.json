According to the OIE, risk analysis comprises hazard identification, risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication.4 Risk is defined in this context as the measure of the probability of the introduction of pathogens or other hazards to animals or animal populations. The hazard identification process seeks to establish which hazards (diseases) are of concern and how they may be introduced. Risk assessment is the process of estimating the probability or likelihood of hazard introduction, as well as the associated implications. The goal of risk management is to reduce both the likelihood and implications of the introduction of the identified hazards. The involvement of all potentially affected parties in the overall process (e.g., problem formulation, pathway and hazard prioritization, data collection and evaluation, result discussion and dissemination, management option evaluation, etc.) is the goal of risk communication. This is an important, but often overlooked, aspect of the risk analysis continuum and should take place throughout the entire process.",

In 2010, recognizing that the range of concerns in relation to wildlife disease had broadened well beyond those associated with animal movements, the OIE and IUCN sponsored the publication of the Manual of Procedures for Wildlife Disease Risk Analysis and its companion, the IUCN Guidelines for Wildlife Disease Risk Analysis.5, 6 The intent of these publications is to assist in the implementation of risk assessment and management when making decisions regarding biodiversity conservation, wildlife health and biosecurity, and domestic animal and public health, when wildlife disease is a critical factor. In an attempt to support interdisciplinary collaboration, encourage informed decision making, align language, and limit confusion, the IUCN adopted the terminology and framework of the OIE in regard to wildlife risk analysis.",

In this case, the implied priority criterion would be transmissibility or infectiousness (\u201cspreadability\u201d) once introduced, and its ability to cross species barriers and cause infection and/or illness. It is important to be very specific about the endpoint of concern because this is the equivalent of a research hypothesis in the risk analysis framework.

The risk assessment phase involves building a representative model of the process, collecting data and/or expert opinion, and characterizing the outcome in some way. Disease modeling has recently become all but an entire discipline in itself; thus, only the basic premise is highlighted here. A risk assessment model is a simplification of the real world and should help determine the likelihood or probability of adverse health effects associated with hazard exposure. This may be qualitative or quantitative depending on the needs of the users and the amount and type of data available. Often, it also must be informed by expert opinion in the wildlife community due to lack of hard data. There are scientific methods, such as the Delphi method, among others, for the collection and analysis of expert opinion that may be used to add rigor to this process.9\n",

This increases the potential spread and complexity of trace-back during investigation, should a negative scenario unfold. Quarantine procedures and regulations for wild ruminants are assumed to significantly reduce exposure risk when properly conducted, but there is great uncertainty surrounding this factor when quarantine occurs at non-USDA facilities, which was found to be a common occurrence.

Indeed, in assessing the consequences of disease introduction, for instance, a degree of subjectivity is almost unavoidable. While this may be less true for laboratory settings, it is more likely when assessing disease or environmental risks in free-ranging wildlife. Risk analyses are seldom truly objective, and for this reason transparency in declaring all assumptions made is essential.11 Most assessments go through several iterations, with data collection needs (gaps) highlighted, that are then either filled or augmented with gathered expert opinion. It is very important not only to cite the source of all data, but also to estimate the quality of the data as a contribution to an overall assessment of uncertainty surrounding results. Thus, risk analysis, although often policy driven, must be a scientifically honest evaluation of what we know and don't know. Transparency itself is a commitment to open communication.",

However, in our passion and excitement, we may convince managers and funders to move forward with little regard for potential implications if this is not discussed up front. On the other hand, health experts may unnecessarily throw up arbitrary barriers due to high perceived risk, which is unsupported by a lack of data and/or great uncertainty surrounding adverse outcomes.
