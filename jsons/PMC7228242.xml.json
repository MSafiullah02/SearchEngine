One male patient with COVID\u201019 found himself coughing. Unaware of the fact that he might have been infected with COVID\u201019 and in a hurry, he did not manage to get a face mask before he took the coach bus from the city back to his county. Many passengers did not wear face masks on the same coach bus. The duration of this bus was 2 hours and 10 minutes, and there were 39 other passengers on the same coach bus. According to epidemiological survey, 5 other passengers on the same coach bus were infected. Upon arrival in the county, this male patient bought a face mask and took a minibus to his final destination wearing the mask. The duration of minibus was 50 minutes, and there were 14 other passengers on the same minibus. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted an epidemiological investigation and close contact tracing management. The passengers on the minibus were screened and treated as suspected cases. A 14\u2010day medical observation period was conducted. During the observation period, passengers were taken temperature twice a day and and were asked whether they had respiratory symptoms such as fever and dry cough, or digestive symptoms such as diarrhea. All the passengers did not have fever, cough, or other abnormal symptoms, and two quantitative reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2010PCR) test results were negative. No passengers were infected COVID\u201019 in the same minibus.",

Previous news reported that The Australian Federal Government has released 500 000 face masks to general practitioners and other health workers across the country to protect them from infection by COVID\u201019.\n4\n Wearing face masks protects yourself and others. Use of face masks is therefore likely to play a vital role in mitigating disease spread.\n5\n\n",

Avoid the trip if any symptoms like fever or coughing are present and go to fever clinics as soon as possible, wearing a face mask. Wear a face mask during the entire trip. It is advised that you bring 1\u20102 extra face masks and wear a new face mask immediately if the old one is deformed or contaminated. Face masks are recommended for diseases transmitted through droplets and respirators for respiratory aerosols and may prevent infection in public settings.\n6\n The potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections and could be useful.\n7\n In the study\n8\n of attitudes of influenza\u2010vaccinated healthcare workers toward masks, 65.7% of the participants agreed with infection control recommendation \u201cwearing a mask\u201d to prevent influenza transmission. Due to the lack of research on face masks, further research should focus on assessing the efficacy of face masks against COVID\u201019, investigating reuse of face masks and assessing compliance.",
