A modified Hosmer-Lemeshow test was then used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the external risk scores across the risk groups defined by Model 1. The test assesses the agreement of the observed mortality rate to the expected mortality rate in subgroups of the model population. If the p-value of the test >0.05, there is no significant difference between observed and expected mortality rates, and the model is said to be well-calibrated. The discriminative abilities of the different models were compared pairwise applying Delong's method for non-parametric correlated AUCs [2] .",

These groups were defined by clinical discretion, as recommended by Altman and Royston [3] . The size of prognostic information was quantified by predicted separation (PSEP) methods; assessing the spread of probabilities in the lower-and higher risk group: The index was calculated as the difference between the predicted probability of dying for a patient in the group with the worst and best diagnosis, respectively. PSEP calculations are also useful for future external validation, as a reduction in separation in future study cohorts may indicate over-optimism in the predictive ability of the model [3] .",
