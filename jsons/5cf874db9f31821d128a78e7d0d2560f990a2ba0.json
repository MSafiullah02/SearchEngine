Due to the different patient populations, regions, and assessment methods across studies, one true effect size cannot be assumed; therefore, a random effects model (DerSimonian & Laird) was used to extract the pooled prevalence. Substantial heterogeneity was defined as I 2 >75%. Subgroup analysis was done in the following categories: gender, rating scales, severity of depression and anxiety and professional group. Sensitivity analysis was done by subtracting each study and calculating the pooled prevalence of the remaining studies, in order to identify studies which may severely affect the pooled prevalence. Our main outcomes were prevalence (p), confidence intervals (CI) and percentage prevalence (p x 100%).",

The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression appeared to be higher in females, which probably reflects the already established gender gap for anxious and depressive symptoms 33 . Again, nursing staff exhibited higher prevalence estimates both for anxiety and depression compared to doctors. These results may be partly confounded by the fact that nurses are mostly female but could be also attributed to the fact they may face a greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients as they spend more time on wards, provide direct care to patients and are responsible for the collection of sputum for virus detection 17 . Moreover, due to their closer contact with patients they may be more exposed to moral injury pertaining to suffering, death and ethical dilemmas. To this end, early, targeted interventions should be considered. Of relevance, another study performed in the original center of the epidemic, Wuhan, showed that a large proportion of HCW in Wuhan were affected and that mental health support was necessary even for mild psychological reactions 43 . Indeed, much can be offered in the current context, such as virtual clinics, remotely delivered psychological therapies and psycho-education, chat lines, digital phenotyping and technologies monitoring risk. Finally, alongside infected patients and HCWs, suspected cases, who are home isolated, and families and friends of affected people have to be supported, too 44 .",

In Hong Kong, medical and nursing staff were found vulnerable to burnout, anxiety and mental exhaustion 34 and in Germany doctors reported high levels of anxious and depressive symptoms35 . Moreover, the psychological impact of the crisis is not only felt by frontline respiratory and intensive care physicians and nurses but also by HCW of other specialties including, for example, surgeons and anesthesiologists36 . Sadly, there have been also reports of suicides, as health care professionals are faced with accumulated psychological pressure and intense fear of dying 37,38 ; this is particularly alarming given the fact that physicians are already at an increased risk of suicide compared to the general population39 . A study exploring factors related to HCWs' psychological difficulties found that infection of colleagues, infection of family members, protective measures and medical violence 40,41 were among the main concerns of HCWs in COVID-19 affected areas. Unsurprisingly, level of social support was found to positively correlate with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively with anxiety and stress 42 .",
