At this exposed position, they serve as receptors for sialic acid-recognising proteins and are consequently involved in wide variety of biological events, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic [1], [2], [3]. One of the most common modifications of sialic acids in mammals is O-acetylation. It occurs either at C-4 or at any position within the glycerol side chain of sialic acid and multiple acetylations are possible (Fig. 1\n) [4], [5].",

            "text": "Sialate-O-acetylation has attracted increased interest in recent years due its abundance and involvement in many, including pathological, biological processes. For instance, acetylation may promote or hinder recognition of sialic acid by proteins, cells or pathogens. O-acetylation may also slow down the activity of degradative enzymes such as sialate lyases or sialidases [3]. Related biological events include cell differentiation, tumor growth, immunity, apoptosis, microbial infections and in particular cancer where they are considered markers for certain skin tumors and a form of leukaemia [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Another important function of O-acetylation is masking of siglec binding sites. CD22, a siglec regulating the activity of the B-cell receptor, binds to \u03b12-6 linked sialic acids, and binding can be masked by 9-O-acetylation [8]. This masking is regulated by the cellular sialate-O-acetylesterase, which thereby also regulates B-cell receptor signal strength [9]. Loss of function of the esterase activity results in autoimmune disease [10], [11].",

Several RNA viruses which infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract utilize sialic acids as a receptor determinant. To facilitate release of progeny virus from infected cells, a number of viruses express \u201creceptor-destroying enzymes\u201d (RDE), which are targets for antiviral drugs. The best known are the sialidase-inhibitors Zanamivir (Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Besides sialidases, the haemagglutinin-esterases (HE) of influenza C virus, isavirus, betacoronaviruses and toroviruses represent another class of RDEs. They are sialate-O-acetylesterases (SOAE) hydrolysing O-acetyl esters of O-acetylated sialic acid derivatives (Fig. 1). Two main subtypes of HEs are known: sialate-4-O-acetylesterases (4-SOAE) and sialate-9-O-acetylesterases (9-SOAE).",

HCoVs account for 10\u201330% of respiratory infections, in particular, the common cold, but they can also cause gastroenteritis and neurological disorders [12], [13]. The infections are usually mild and subclinical, but strains related to OC43 and HKU1 were associated with severe human disease [14], [15]. Betacoronaviruses have attracted attention after the outbreak of SARS CoV in 2002/2003. This genus consists of human and animal viruses. Coronaviruses are able to cross the animal-to-human species barrier: bat-to-human in case of SARS CoV [16], [17] and bovine-to-human in case of BCoV leading to HCoV OC43 [18]. Toroviruses (ToV) are evolutionary related to coronaviruses [19]. ToV are associated with asymptomatic enteric infections in pigs [20]. Studies suggest that they are highly prevalent in swine populations [21], [22]. The closely related bovine toroviruses (BToV) are implicated with serious or even fatal infections [23], [24], [25]; they are found worldwide [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. ToV are also associated with human gastroenteritis. In fecal samples from children and adults with diarrhoea, torovirus antigens were detected by ELISA [31], [32], immunoelectron microscopy [33], [34], [35] and by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with primers covering a highly conserved region of the ToV genomes [35].",

Triethylamine (47 \u03bcL, 0.336 mmol) was added followed by a few minutes of stirring. Thiophenol (17 \u03bcL, 0.168 mmol) was then added and the solution was stirred overnight. Over the course of 4 days, a further 4 portions of triethylamine (47 \u03bcL, 0.336 mmol) and thiophenol (17 \u03bcL, 0.168 mmol) were added whilst maintaining the THF solvent volume (\u223c0.5\u20130.7 mL). Once TLC analysis had indicated that the reaction had progressed no further, the solvent was evaporated in vacuo and purified on a short silica plug (DCM:MeOH; 5:1 \u2192 2:1 \u2192 MeOH) to give the deprotected phosphonate intermediate which was lyophilised with dioxane/H2O (10.2 mg, 74%). The deprotected phosphonate intermediate (10 mg) was then treated with a 1:1 mixture of dioxane and 0.05 M NaOH (aq.) at approximately 4\u20135 \u00b0C for 2 h after which the solution was neutralised with ion-exchange resin Amberlite IR-120. After filtration, the solvent was removed and the residue was purified by gel permeation chromatography to afford compound 4 (9.6 mg, \u223cqu.) after lyophilisation.

Samples containing glycosidically bound sialic acids were first hydrolysed with 2 M propionic acid for 2 h at 80 \u00b0C. The further processing of the samples was described elsewhere [53].",
