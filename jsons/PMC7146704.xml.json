The substantial decreases in paediatric care access in Italy might reflect scarcity of available resources due to pandemic-related redistribution, or reticence on the part of parents and caregivers to risk exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a health-care setting, in addition to lower rates of acute infections and trauma. This reduced access to health care can be detrimental to paediatric health, and children with special needs (eg, due to cerebral palsy, epileptic encephalopathy, severe syndromic illnesses, or iatrogenic or disease-related immunosuppression) are potentially at higher risk of severe illness from not accessing health care than their healthy peers.",

Two children presented to the emergency department with acute-onset type 1 diabetes and severe ketoacidosis due to delayed access to hospital care, even though parents had recognised abnormal symptoms (eg, polydipsia, polyuria, and dyspnoea); both required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Of two children with acute-onset leukaemia, one arrived in the emergency department after 7 days of very high fever (>39\u00b0C) and the other presented with severe anaemia (haemoglobin 4\u00b72 mg/dL) and respiratory distress after emergency department access was delayed. One of these patients died several days after hospital admission. One child presented with long-lasting convulsions after three previous episodes of convulsions had been treated at home without medical assistance; the patient was eventually diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. A 3-year-old girl was admitted to hospital after 6 days at home with very high fever (>39\u00b0C), with a sepsis secondary to a pyelonephritis. A neonate was kept home despite vomiting for several days because of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and arrived in the emergency department in hypovolaemic shock. Another child, aged 2 years, had been vomiting for several days and unable to eat before presenting with severe hypoglycaemia. One child arriving in the emergency department having been unable to pass faeces for more than a week was diagnosed with an abdominal mass of 15 cm diameter, later diagnosed as Wilm's tumour; the diagnosis by telephone from his paediatrician had been functional constipation. An adolescent with cerebral palsy and severe malnutrition got in touch with the hospital after 10 days of fever at home with increased oxygen needs, and died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. The precise cause of fever and death was not ascertained but the adolescent was negative for COVID-19 infection. Another child with cerebral palsy, tracheotomy, and enteral nutrition died on route to the hospital after 3 days of bloody stools. A child with Mowat Wilson syndrome, in dialysis for chronic renal insufficiency, arrived at the hospital after 3 days of being \u201cless active than usual\u201d with capillary refill time of 4 s, heart rate of 50 beats per min, oxygen saturation level not detectable, mixed acidosis, and creatine 4 mg/dL; the child died after 4 days in the ICU.",

Furthermore, in five cases, the family had contacted health services before accessing care, but their health provider was unavailable because of the COVID-19 epidemic, or hospital access was discouraged because of the possible risk of infection. All cases were either negative for SARS-CoV-2 or had a clinical presentation (eg, diabetes) that did not justify a diagnostic test according to the national criteria. Notably, no death occurred in the same hospitals during the same period in 2019, and the total yearly number of paediatric deaths in these hospitals ranges from zero to three.",

However, since delay in access to care was not monitored systematically, this small case series might underestimate the problem. We believe that further monitoring of access to routine clinical care is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to prevent delays in accessing hospital care and to increase provision of high-quality coordinated care by health-care providers. Both of these aspects should be considered as part of the overall public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as evident in other epidemics,3, 4 and must be adequately monitored.",
