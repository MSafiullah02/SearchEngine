In the March 2020 issue of the MJR, the initiatives for two large registers sponsored by ERE-EPERE are presented. The first one is a contemporary, web-based and easy-to-use patient registry specifically for patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitides (AAV).12 The purpose of the project is to increase our understanding of AAV in our country, with a future prospect of contributing to and sharing data with other international registries. The second one is a pilot study of an electronic registry for monitoring Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients who are treated with novel/biologic therapies.13 The therapeutic armamentarium in SLE is expanding with the introduction of novel biologic and small-molecule agents. Registry-based studies with high external validity and long-term follow up of patients are needed. Moreover, data from registries can be used to identify disease phenotypes that best respond to biologic agents, and to correlate clinical response with parameters such as co-administered therapies and comorbidities. With regard to this, Kourti et al.8 provide insights into the regulation of microRNAs, namely miR-21 and miR-22 in SLE, and the preliminary results of this research indicate a potential role of these molecules in the assessment of disease severity.",

Lifestyle modification is now recognised as a major part of care in most rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases, and several of the concepts described here may be generic and transferable to other disease entities. A number of very interesting case reports are included in this issue. In a case-report by Dr Partalidou et al.,10 a rare case of rhombencephalitis in a patient with known neuro-Behcet\u2019s disease is described. It is known that Anti-melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (anti-MDA5) autoantibodies are associated with amyopathic dermatomyositis and in particular with rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease. Dr. Zohar et al.9 discuss the prognostic value of these autoantibodies and ferritin levels in the outcome. On the top of the case reports, a clinical image communication addresses the differences between diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) and spondyloarthropathies on radiological grounds; a very common dilemma in daily clinical practice.11",
