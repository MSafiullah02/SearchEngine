None of the patients was admitted to ICU, therefore; we tempt to 106 speculate that the inability to attain advanced intensive care support could have 107 influence the outcome of some patients who eventually died. However, a recent small 108 series reported variable outcomes in KT patients with COVID-19 that required 109 mechanical ventilation [11] . It is important to point out that results of our multivariate 110 analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. Of note, 111 treatment with hydroxychloroquine and prophylactic anticoagulation were more 112 commonly administered in kidney transplant survivors, suggesting a hypothetical 113 protective role in this group (Table 3) . However, due to the retrospective nature of our 114 work and the size of our study population, no causal relationships can be established. 115",
