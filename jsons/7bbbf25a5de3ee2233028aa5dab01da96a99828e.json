To achieve this level of detection, an on-going programme of 7,800 tests per million people per week for the NZ population would be required. The vast majority of this testing (96%) would be of symptomatic cases in primary care settings and the rest in hospitals. Despite the large number of tests required, there are plausible strategies to enhance testing yield and cost-effectiveness eg, (i) adjusting the eligibility criteria via symptom profiles; (ii) and pooling of test samples. Conclusions: This model-based analysis suggests that a surveillance system with a very high level of routine testing is probably required to detect an emerging or re-emerging SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within one month of a border control failure in a nation.",

We assumed that the initial undetected case could be at any stage of infectionto cover both failures of managing quarantine at the border, but also failures around the management of nonquarantined workers such as air-crew and ship-crew. Scenarios considered different levels of transmission with the effective reproduction number (Re) of SARS-CoV-2 to be 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 (Table A1) . Other scenarios considered the impact of 75% of symptomatic people seeking a medical consultation (eg, as the result of a potential media campaign); and another considered a possible school outbreak (eg, a border control failure involving a teacher or student returning from overseas).

In each simulation, the sum of all the rates that change the current state of the system is calculated as is chosen, and the first transition in the order whose cumulative rate is larger than 2 r is performed. If, for example, the event is an infection, one individual is removed from the group of susceptible individuals and added to the group of latent individuals of stage 1.

Of note is that modellers in the United Kingdom (UK) have used 4.4% (of all infected cases) [20] , and for modelling in the United States 3%, 5% and 12% have been proposed [21] . The length of hospitalisation was assumed to be 10 days which is similar to other modelling work eg, 10 There is uncertainty around this value but we used the same estimate as in recent UK modelling [20] . This has biological plausibility as while there is similarity in viral loads between asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients [24] , it would be expected that those who are fully symptomatic (with a cough etc.) would be more likely to transmit infection. Of note is an estimate from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, that 17.9% of COVID-19 infections were from asymptomatic individuals (95% credible interval 15.5-20.2%) [25] . But it is unclear how generalisable this finding is given the crowded cruise ship conditions and the typically elderly nature of the passengers. Latency period 4 days We used an average duration of 4 days as per Read et al [26] , with a standard deviation (SD) of 25% (1 day) (calculated using 16 stages; Erlang distribution).

For the first part of the delay we considered a study in Beijing, China, which reported the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days [32] . Another Chinese study of 710 patients with pneumonia [33] reported that those dying had a median duration from onset of symptoms to radiological confirmation of pneumonia of 5 (IQR: 3-7) days. For the testing delay we noted that the aim in NZ is to obtain the result of the tests in under 24-hours regardless of the primary care or hospital setting. But this may not always be the case for rural and small town settings. In our simulations, test results were available on average 5.94 days after symptom onset (SD: 1.36 days).",
