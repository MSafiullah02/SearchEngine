This is due to the fact that high earners can consume low productivity, non essential products, which allows everybody to remain employed even when the productivity of essential goods is high and producing them does not require everybody to work. We derive a relation between heterogeneities in technologies and the minimum Gini coefficient required to maximize global welfare. Stronger inequalities appear to be economically unjustified. Our model may shed light on the role of non-essential goods in the economy, a topical issue when thinking about the post-Covid-19 world.",

The rich are depicted as heroes or villain in a knee-jerk fashion, depending on which side of the political spectrum one speaks from. Is there a way to frame the debate in more neutral, rational terms? John Rawles, for example, famously argued that the income distribution should be such that the wage of the poorest households is maximized [11] . This, however, does not a priori constrain the Gini index in any way. Free market advocates believe that the whole debate is moot: whatever comes out of a free market economy is by definition optimal [12] . There is a growing literature on optimal taxes, in particular progressive, redistributive taxes and/or bequeath taxes, see e.g. [13] [14] [15] . A standard argument for limiting tax progressivity (and therefore keeping inequalities above a certain level) is a potential reduction of the incentives to work and to invest in skills. A stronger public sector, on the other hand, can be beneficial in terms of long term growth, through different channels such as health, education, public research, etc. [16] . However, crazy-looking initiatives launched by single individuals, which would never be decided collectively by any sensible public agency, can lead to ground-breaking innovations that are collectively beneficial.",

We argue that when the utility associated to the consumption of goods saturates (i.e. when further consumption brings no extra utility at all), then increased productivity can lead to unemployment, which is an extreme form of income inequality. For full employment to be maintained, the consumption of low productivity, expensive goods must be bolstered. In some cases, which we explore below within a highly simplified model, this is only possible when some households earn more than others. We derive the minimum value of the Gini coefficient for full employment (and hence maximum total utility) to be achieved. In a nutshell, our argument is based on the idea that if the productivity of a non-essential good is too low, its price is too high for any agent to afford in a strictly egalitarian society. Hence, this good is not produced at all. But if at the same time the essential good is easy to produce while its utility saturates, only a fraction of the labour force is needed and output remain low. In this case, global welfare is higher when the Gini coefficient is non-zero, i.e. in the presence of some degree of wage inequalities. These can be however partly compensated by some redistributive policies, since tax revenues can be increased.",

Region A corresponds to a \"primitive economy\" where all wages are equal, but good 2 is not produced. Region B corresponds to a developing economy, where productivity of the essential good is moderately large (\u0393 1 < z 1 < z * 1 , with z * 1 := z 2 \u0393 1 /(z 2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 )). Full employment can only be reached at the expense of wage inequalities. Region C, for large enough productivity z 1 > z * 1 , allows the economy to recover full employment with equal wages. Note that region B extends to z 1 \u2192 \u221e when z 2 < \u03b3 2 .",

So taking the derivative of with respect to r < and r > leads to, respectively:where \u039e <,> \u2265 0 andSince r < + r > \u2265 2 r < r > , one should separate two cases:\u2022 \u03b2 \u2264 1: in this case \u2202 U/\u2202 r < \u2265 0 and global welfare is maximized when r < = 1, and therefore f > = 0. A few high earners may exist, allow good 2 to be produced, but their number is so small that the utility is equal to 1 and the Gini coefficient is zero.\u2022 \u03b2 > 1: the optimal low wage is now given by the equationOn the other hand, since \u2202 U/\u2202 r > \u2264 0, the optimal high wage is given by its lower bound:The last solution however only makes sense provided r * < \u2264 1, i.e.In this case, the Gini coefficient isSummarizing: for a non-saturating, concave utility function, one still finds that there is a region of parameters where inequalities do improve global welfare, when quantisation effects are taken into account. The phase diagram is however a little different from the one shown in Fig. 2 . For fixed values of z 1 , \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 , one finds that when \u03b3 2 is below a certain threshold \u03b3 * 2 (equal to 0.033/\u03b8 2 2 when z 1 \u03b8 2 1 = 1), inequalities are never beneficial. When however \u03b3 2 > \u03b3 * 2 , there exists a region z 2 \u2208 (z \u2020 2 , z * 2 ) within which the optimal wage distribution has a positive Gini coefficient, i.e. when Eq. (48) leads to G > 0.",
