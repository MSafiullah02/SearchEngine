Current recommendations for extubation of COVID-19 patients include performance in an airborne isolation room and the advice that \u201cthe endotracheal tube be removed as smoothly as is feasible\u201d to avoid coughing and expectoration of virus-laden secretions [1]. For non-emergent operating room cases, extra precautions to minimize aerosolization of virus-containing droplets are warranted in case patients might be in an early, asymptomatic stage of infection. This advice has prompted renewed interest in the technique of deep extubation among American anesthesiologists and other physicians, many of whom (as opposed to colleagues in the United Kingdom) are accustomed to performing extubation only when a patient is fully awake and able to follow commands.",

While the technical definition of laryngospasm is generally understood as prolonged involuntary occlusion of the glottis, this narrow definition neglects the complex functional anatomy of the upper airways. Airflow may be blocked at levels other than the vocal cords, and positive-pressure ventilation paradoxically may worsen rather than alleviate laryngeal occlusion. Understanding the functional anatomy of the larynx is critical to the management of dynamic airway occlusion including laryngospasm. This paper reviews laryngeal function and outlines differential diagnostic considerations for acute airway obstruction following extubation. We review methods to achieve smooth extubation without coughing or agitation, and offer a clinical pathway to diagnose and terminate upper airway obstruction including laryngospasm promptly should it occur. The mastery of technique for successful and smooth extubation has the potential to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 to the benefit of operating room and intensive care unit personnel.",

Its primary purpose is to prevent aspiration of food into the trachea during swallowing; phonation evolved much later as a secondary benefit. The thyroid, cricoid, and paired arytenoid cartilages provide the skeletal framework, connected and supported by intrinsic laryngeal muscles, ligaments, and synovial joints. The paired vocal folds span the distance between the arytenoid cartilages posteriorly and the anterior angle of the thyroid cartilage. The term vocal \u201cfold\u201d is more precise than vocal \u201ccord\u201d because the lateral edge of the tissue is not free. Above these true vocal folds are the structures colloquially known as the false cords, also called the vestibular or ventricular folds.

The sensory fibers are most heavily distributed in the laryngeal inlet and epiglottis, but pharyngeal plexus sensory fibers also anastomose with laryngeal motor nerves in a reflex arc [5,6].

A similar but stronger laryngeal adductor reflex acts to protect the lower airways from noxious environmental stimuli such as inhaled smoke or chemicals [7]. In the setting of intensive care and/or anesthesia, this reflex glottic closure may occur following innocuous stimuli: secretions irritating the larynx, a rapid inflow of cold dry air as with an \u201coxygen flush\u201d from the anesthesia circuit, or a foreign body such as an endotracheal tube.",

            "text": "The reflex closure of the larynx is a primitive, hard-wired survival mechanism, and the vocal folds function as the last line of defense with a valvular effect to prevent entry of foreign matter. While the true vocal folds are passively relaxed and open during quiet breathing, it has been known since the 19th century that their tight adduction prevents the entrance of air or any other substance [8]. The true vocal cords abduct in response to pressure from below, as in coughing or laughing, not to pressure from above. The external pressure required to overcome the valvular closure of the true vocal cords approaches 140 mmHg or 190 cmH2O in adults and up to 50 cmH2O in infants and children [9,10]. To put these numbers in perspective, the default high-pressure setting on many anesthesia machines is 40 cmH2O and the high-pressure safety valve on the ventilator is typically set to release at 75 cmH2O. It would be difficult to obtain a seal with a conventional facemask sufficient to generate such peak pressures with manual ventilation. As Petcu and Sasaki have observed, \u201cThis protective arrangement can be especially appreciated by the difficulty experienced with overcoming laryngospasm by positive-pressure ventilation\u201d [9]. The powerful closure of the vocal folds in laryngospasm may continue well beyond the cessation of the stimulus that provoked it [9,11].",

Part of the answer is that standard anesthesiology references continue to advocate positive-pressure ventilation by mask as the first step in the management of laryngospasm even while acknowledging that often it fails [10,13]. Another part of the answer may be that eventually the patient in laryngospasm - pediatric or adult - will develop hypercarbia which depresses adductor activity, as will hypoxemia if the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) declines to less than 50 mmHg [11,14]. If hypoxemia and hypercarbia are the result of futile attempts at mask ventilation, these attempts may be falsely credited with success in \u201cbreaking\u201d laryngospasm. However, severe hypoxemia and hypercarbia cannot be viewed as desirable routes toward rescue, and may lead rapidly to bradycardia and cardiac arrest in infants and young children. In adults, negative-pressure pulmonary edema may result from a patient\u2019s strenuous efforts to breathe during prolonged airway obstruction [15-18].",

Some writers refer to \u201cpartial laryngospasm\u201d, which may be more accurately described as inspiratory stridor [19]. This phenomenon may be seen with vocal cord dysfunction or damage. In anesthesiology practice, stridor may be encountered immediately after extubation while the laryngeal muscles are still in a state of relaxation from the residual effects of inhalation anesthesia or sedatives, and the opening of the airway is incomplete. The Bernoulli effect causes increased velocity of airflow through the narrowed laryngeal inlet and glottis during spontaneous inspiration, resulting in a musical or whistling inspiratory stridor or \u201ccrowing\u201d. This effect typically will dissipate on its own as recovery from anesthesia continues. However, it may be improved with gentle positive-pressure assistance to increase airway diameter and neutralize the Bernoulli effect [12]. In contrast to stridor, complete laryngospasm is silent with no movement of air between the closed larynx and the lungs, and attempts at positive-pressure ventilation may serve only to aggravate the problem [9,12].",

The twin fears of aspiration and laryngospasm are the two reasons most often cited by anesthesiologists as reasons to extubate patients only when they are fully awake [22]. Certainly, appropriate patient selection is critical to prevent aspiration whenever the airway is unprotected, whether the setting is induction of general anesthesia or deep extubation at procedure end (appropriate patient selection is equally important in the decision to employ a laryngeal mask airway, or to provide deep sedation with an unprotected airway for endoscopy, angiography, or surgery under monitored anesthesia care). Contraindications include but are not limited to a non-fasted state, achalasia, difficult airway, gastric outlet or bowel obstruction, gastroparesis, ileus, impaired swallowing, morbid obesity, and pregnancy. Of note, the use of sugammadex instead of neostigmine to reverse muscle relaxation was associated with a 30%-50% lower risk of postoperative pneumonia and respiratory failure in a recent large multi-center study, suggesting that incomplete reversal of muscle relaxant may play a larger role than previously recognized in pulmonary complications including aspiration [23].",

It is an article of faith in anesthesiology education that extubation should be performed with the patient either deeply anesthetized or fully awake [10]. Yet in practice, many experienced physicians will extubate before patients have fully emerged from sedation or anesthesia [22]. Frost and colleagues have described success with the technique of \u201csedated extubation,\u201d in which the patient demonstrates return of protective airway reflexes prior to extubation but is not reacting to the endotracheal tube to the point of gagging or coughing [25]. There are no data to support the hypothesis that one method of extubation is conclusively better than another in preventing laryngospasm. In pediatric patients, a recent metanalysis concluded that deep extubation reduces the overall risk of airway complications, and that no difference was observed in the risk of laryngospasm or breath-holding regardless of extubation technique or airway device [26]. The major differentiating factor may be operator expertise in managing the airway.",

First, it must be noted that \u201cStage 2\u201d is defined as a \u201cdelirium\u201d or \u201cexcitement\u201d stage of light anesthesia, first described by Guedel in 1927 while using diethyl ether, and characterized by rapid eyeball activity, swallowing, variable respiration, and potential vomiting [27]. It is rare to see an \u201cexcitement\u201d phase with the balanced techniques of anesthesia in common use today. During inhalation induction, it is unwise to attempt to instrument the airway too early as the patient will react by coughing or moving, but overpressure with a high inspired concentration of sevoflurane quickly bypasses any excitement stage on the way to achieving the deeper stage of surgical anesthesia [10]. During emergence, today\u2019s anesthetics balance the use of intravenous sedatives and analgesics, less-soluble inhalation agents, antiemetic medications, and multimodal analgesia. The development of new anesthetic agents in the second half of the 20th century effectively eliminated diethyl ether - and with it, a prolonged excitement phase during induction or emergence - from modern practice. Extubation of a deeply anesthetized or sedated patient today routinely produces a smooth emergence without laryngospasm or an excitement phase that would be consistent with the traditional description of \u201cStage 2\u201d anesthesia. Excitement and uncontrolled behavior are more likely to ensue from awake extubation if vigorous suctioning, physical stimulation, and loud verbal commands precede removal of the endotracheal tube [25].",

The administration of intravenous lidocaine prior to extubation has been demonstrated to decrease airway irritability without depressing respiration or delaying emergence [30-32]. The selective use of propofol, fentanyl, remifentanil, hydromorphone, tramadol, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, or magnesium may smooth the course of extubation, whether the intent is to extubate the trachea with the patient awake, sedated, or deeply anesthetized [13,28,29,33,34].

Such cases may represent laryngospasm, or they may reflect supraglottic airway obstruction at the level of the tongue or the soft palate, as in obesity or obstructive sleep apnea. Other possible clinical diagnoses, summarized in Table 1, include airway edema, tracheomalacia, vocal cord paralysis, tetany due to hypocalcemia after parathyroidectomy, bronchospasm, pneumothorax, or inadequate reversal of muscle relaxant.",

In a patient of any age who is making vigorous effort to breathe spontaneously but is not achieving effective air exchange, immediate attempts to ventilate with positive pressure by mask may only make airway closure worse and risk inflating the stomach [9,12]. If laryngospasm is suspected, the better initial step is to proceed with maneuvers to open the airway, as Fink recommends, beginning with \u201cstrong pressure behind the angles of the jaw\u201d and optional insertion of a supraglottic airway [12,35]. An additional option is to apply firm upward pressure as described by Larson at the \u201claryngospasm notch\u201d just below the earlobe - bounded anteriorly by the condyle of the mandible, posteriorly by the mastoid process, and superiorly by the base of the skull - while lifting the mandible and delivering oxygen by mask without positive pressure, as demonstrated in Video 1 [36,37,38].",

In a vigorous adult, powerful negative inspiratory force against an obstructed airway can generate pulmonary edema in only two or three breaths [15-18]. Delaying the decision to take definitive action increases the risk of serious complications with each passing moment. The key is to induce sleep and relaxation, even if accompanied by brief apnea. Propofol alone may suffice if the patient has intravenous access, though a muscle relaxant such as succinylcholine may be required for the treatment of refractory cases. For infants and young children without intravenous access, intramuscular succinylcholine may be necessary to permit successful mask ventilation [19]. As the larynx relaxes and the airway opens, any secretions can be cleared, mask ventilation becomes possible, and the physician can decide calmly whether or not to intubate or reintubate, as outlined in the algorithm, Figure 3. Often, if recognition of laryngeal occlusion is prompt and successful treatment is employed, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and intubation may be avoided.",

It supports the conclusion that smooth extubation without active coughing - whether awake, sedated, or deep - may be accomplished with care but without fear once there is clear understanding of the functional anatomy of the larynx and of dynamic airway obstruction, which can occur at levels of the pharynx and larynx cephalad to the true vocal folds. There are many approaches to achieving smooth extubation with a variety of adjunct medications. Should upper airway obstruction occur after extubation, the steps toward successful management are straightforward. Even true laryngospasm should never be more than a nuisance, should rarely require positive-pressure ventilation or reintubation, and with vigilance should never result in tragedy. Smooth, well-controlled extubation reduces coughing, expectoration, and the unnecessary exposure of operating room and intensive care personnel to aerosolized, potentially infectious, airway secretions.",
