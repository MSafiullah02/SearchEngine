Although this syndrome affects the lung heterogeneously, mechanical ventilation is not guided by regional indicators of potential lung injury. We used electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to estimate the extent of regional lung overdistension and atelectasis during mechanical ventilation. Techniques for tidal breath detection, lung identification, and regional compliance estimation were combined with the Graz consensus on EIT lung imaging (GREIT) algorithm. Nine ALI/ARDS patients were monitored during stepwise increases and decreases in airway pressure. Our method detected individual breaths with 96.0% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity. The duration and volume of tidal breaths erred on average by 0.2 s and 5%, respectively. Respiratory system compliance from EIT and ventilator measurements had a correlation coefficient of 0.80. Stepwise increases in pressure could reverse atelectasis in 17% of the lung. At the highest pressures, 73% of the lung became overdistended. During stepwise decreases in pressure, previously-atelectatic regions remained open at sub-baseline pressures. We recommend that the proposed approach be used in collaborative research of EIT-guided ventilation strategies for ALI/ARDS.

            "text": "M ECHANICAL ventilation is an essential part of caring for critically-ill patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or its more severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Unfortunately, it has become clear after two decades of research that mechanical ventilation itself can exacerbate lung injury and, thus, increase the chance of death [1] , [2] . Multicenter trials attempting to reduce the mortality among ALI/ARDS patients by strategic selection of ventilation parameters have led to mixed results [3] - [6] . Their goal was to find a lung protective tidal volume ( ) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to measurements that characterize the lung as a whole. Advances in lung imaging research are now calling into question the presumption that whole-lung measurements are sufficient for identifying lung protective ventilation settings for ALI/ARDS. Computed tomography (CT) and, more recently, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) show that the mechanical properties of the ALI/ARDS lung are, in fact, very heterogeneous [7] , [8] . Furthermore, the percentage of collapsed, but potentially recruitable, lung throughout the patient population is highly variable [9] . In some patients, typical ventilator settings can lead to regional lung overdistension and atelectasis, which correlate with subsequent lung injury [10] , [11] . Consistent with these findings, a meta-analysis combining the data from multicenter trials has shown that only the subgroup of patients with ARDS showed a reduction in mortality to higher levels of PEEP [12] . Everything considered, ALI/ARDS affects lung mechanics in a heterogeneous manner. Therefore, a reduction in mortality among patients will most likely require a ventilation strategy based on regional indicators of lung mechanics.",

Our objective is to encourage multicenter collaboration by proposing a comprehensive software solution for all data processing stages: from data acquisition to physiological interpretation. The design criteria we have selected for this purpose are: currency of the techniques used, compatibility with most EIT systems, transparency of the software implementation, physiological interpretability of output, and automaticity of processing where possible. We implement and demonstrate a software solution according to these criteria, which is available to all investigators, and amenable to updates and improvements. We believe that the output from an EIT system utilizing such software would be physiologically interpretable by clinical staff and directly comparable with output from other centers.",

The data acquisition and image reconstruction algorithms used here conform to the Graz consensus on EIT lung imaging (GREIT), as described by Adler et al. [13] . GREIT provides the broadest consensus on EIT lung imaging techniques for electrode placement, stimulation and measurement patterns, as well as image reconstruction algorithms. Upon this framework, we develop an automatic filtering technique to attenuate nonrespiratory signals and to detect peak inspiratory and expiratory time points for the measurement of regional tidal volume. The corresponding filtered images are then used for lung region classification based on the functional EIT (fEIT) method of Pulletz et al. [14] . We embed the fEIT method within an algorithm to automatically determine the threshold parameter for lung classification and to aggregate lung regions identified over time. The tidal volume images and ventilator pressure measurements are combined into maps of regional respiratory system compliance. 2 We represent temporal changes in respiratory system compliance with a pair of images: the first quantifies the maximum compliance at each pixel, and the second indicates the ventilatory pressure when it was achieved. These results are used to estimate the percentage and location of lung overdistension and atelectasis using the method of Costa et al. [15] .",

In order to display the maximum regional compliance at every pixel and the pressure at which this compliance was achieved, we use a pair of images labeled and whose pixel values correspond to the quantities satisfying (6) and (7), respectively (Fig. 4) . Each row of Fig. 4 shows the regional compliance data for one patient. The first pair of images shows the maximum regional compliance at each pixel (i.e., map) and the corresponding plateau pressure needed for each pixel to reach its maximum (i.e., map) during lung recruitment. The second pair of images shows the and maps in the same format for the PEEP Titration stage with the exception that the map quantifies PEEP. Because the maximum respiratory system compliance achieved by each patient was highly variable, ranging from 0.1-0.9 cm , the color scale was set according to the individual. Regions of high compliance are bright, while those of low compliance are dark. For each patient, the same color scale was used for both stages. The map uses dark colors to show regions that reached maximum compliance at low pressures, and bright colors for regions that reached maximum compliance at high pressures. Again, because each patient ended either stage at different pressures, the map color scale was set according to the individual. Patient #4 met safety-related stopping criteria during lung recruitment and, therefore, did not undergo PEEP titration. These results suggest that a considerable degree of heterogeneity exists throughout the lungs of each patient. All maps contain a patchy distribution of regions of low and high compliance. In most cases, compliance throughout the whole lung is not maximized at a single pressure as shown by the mosaic pattern of the maps. This heterogeneity of compliance does not change significantly during the protocol, since the maps obtained from the lung recruitment and PEEP Titration stages are very similar. There is virtually no difference in the lung ROI between stages, and the locations of high compliance also do not change remarkably. A comparison of the maps for each patient shows that the dorsal region compliance values reached during the lung recruitment stage are maintained at much lower pressures during PEEP Titration stage. Similar results exhibiting this form of lung volume hysteresis have been shown in spirometry studies of the ARDS lung [24] . In order to examine how the lung mechanics evolved during the lung recruitment and PEEP Titration stages, we pooled the pressure and compliance data from all patients for each step of the protocol (Table I) . The fourth column of Table I shows the average over the entire lung ROI. As a result of increasing plateau pressure by 23 cm , the respiratory system compliance dropped from a baseline value of 0.3 cm to 0.1 cm during the lung recruitment stage. Upon transition to the first step of the PEEP Titration stage (\"T1\" in Table I ), the effects of hysteresis were already apparent. Respiratory system compliance returned to the baseline level at 0.3 cm , effectively tripling the compliance measured at comparable pressure during step \"R2\" of lung recruitment. Reduction in pressure during PEEP Titration further increased compliance, which exceeded baseline and reached a maximum of 0.5 cm at step \"T4.\" Reduction in pressure below values in step \"T4\" appeared to reduce compliance to levels smaller than baseline. The last column of Table I shows the percentage of pixels within the lung that met their maximum compliance during each step of the protocol. While pressure increased during the lung recruitment stage, the fraction of pixels at their maximum compliance fell from 52% to as low as 3% at step \"R3.\" This effect was reversed during the PEEP Titration stage, where as much as 46% of pixels became maximally compliant at step \"T4.\" This extent of maximal regional compliance was not sustained with the lower pressures in steps \"T5-T8.\"",

The maps for regional overdistension and atelectasis are demonstrated for one patient in Fig. 5 . The color of each pixel within the lung corresponds to the value from (8) . Each image answers the question of \"how much\" and \"where\" overdistension (blue) and atelectasis (red) takes place during each step of the protocol. Plateau pressure and PEEP are shown above each image, and pixel-averaged overdistension and atelectasis are shown below. In this patient, overdistension took place in as much as 82% of the lung ROI during the lung recruitment stage. The most severe overdistension was in the ventral lung regions. Interestingly, during the fourth and final step of lung recruitment, overdistension fell back to 78%, suggesting the aeration of novel regions. The effect of this regional opening can be seen as a retreat of the interface between ventral overdistension (blue pixels) and adequate aeration (black pixels). Before commencing the PEEP Titration stage, the nondependent lung is almost completely overdistended. The benefit of these high pressures can be seen in the reversal of atelectasis (red pixels) in the dependent lung. A cm was necessary to reverse atelectasis in 5% of the lung down to 3%. At the end of the protocol, atelectasis was confined to 3% of the lung utilizing cm and cm . This was less than half of the pressure required to achieve the same degree of atelectasis reversal during the lung recruitment stage.",

This recruitment strategy resulted in the resolution of atelectasis in of the lung [ Fig. 6(a) ]. During the PEEP Titration stage, while PEEP was reduced from 20 to 14 cm , overdistension was maintained within approximately 20% of the lung, and atelectasis was maintained within 10% of the lung [ Fig. 6(b) ]. The In summary, stepwise increases in pressure could reverse atelectasis within 17% of the lung, appearing primarily in the dorsal regions. During the highest pressures applied, 73% of the lung became overdistended, appearing primarily in the ventral regions. Overdistension subsided during stepwise decreases in pressure, and previously-atelectatic regions remained open at pressures below those at baseline. Together, these results suggest that the described ventilation strategy can effectively recruit the lung, and that EIT imaging can be used to guide the reduction of ventilatory pressures to avoid re-collapse of the lung.",

These studies provide important insights into how the EIT data stream can be interpreted physiologically. Most recently, the following methods have been proposed: an intra-tidal respiratory system compliance index [15] , fEIT changes between PEEP settings [30] , a respiratory system compliance percentile change from a scaled baseline value [31] , a regional lung state classification index based on changes between PEEP settings [32] , the dorsoventral center-of-mass coordinate of a spectral power EIT image [33] , an intra-tidal global ventilation inhomogeneity index [34] , and ventilator-calibrated regional distributions of end-expiratory lung volume and potentially-recruitable lung volume [35] . In addition to this variety of proposed indexes of lung mechanics, each assumes that a reconstruction algorithm has already computed the images from the voltage measurements. However, it is difficult to compare results obtained from arbitrary reconstruction algorithms, since the ill-posed nature of the EIT conductivity problem can cause different algorithms to generate rather divergent images from the same data [36] .",

The methods were chosen according to criteria that we deemed essential for developing EIT-guided mechanical ventilation within the critical care setting. The lung imaging methods conform to the GREIT specifications [13] , which are recognized by a large collaborative network of scientific and clinical experts as being the state-of-the-art in EIT lung imaging. Image reconstruction was essentially automatic, since only the regularization parameter occasionally required adjustments when working with a new patient. The subsequent steps performed individual breath detection, lung ROI classification [14] , and regional lung mechanics analysis [15] . We reasoned that this approach would be helpful in the intensive care unit, since very few parameter adjustments are required, and the variables quantifying lung mechanics are familiar to the clinician. Also, since our estimates of regional tidal volume are obtained from the average difference between images at end-expiration and end-inspiration, we do not anticipate a bias due to changes in pulmonary perfusion.",

First, lung recruitment studies using CT imaging have shown a heterogeneous distribution of lung density in ARDS [7] , where the dependent lung regions are predominantly collapsed. The respiratory system compliance data in our study also suggest that the ALI/ARDS lung in our patients consisted of a patchy distribution of high and low compliance regions, each requiring different airway pressures for maximizing regional compliance. The patients in our sample also exhibited a trend of progressive lung recruitment in the ventral-to-dorsal direction, supporting the proposition that dorsal regions are subject to the gravitational force from ventral regions and, therefore, require additional pressure to inflate. Second, hysteresis of the ALI/ARDS lung has been previously studied by comparing static pressure-volume data acquired during inflation and deflation [24] . We found that the regional and total respiratory system compliance data also indicated the presence of lung volume hysteresis, where improved compliance was achieved during the PEEP Titration stage at lower pressures than those used during baseline and the lung recruitment stage. Finally, the correlations between changes in respiratory system compliance measured by EIT and by the ventilator suggest that the anatomical landmarks for electrode placement are appropriate for monitoring the regional lung mechanics in patients with ALI/ARDS. Although lung CT imaging is the gold standard for anatomical recruitment, such measures were unjustified in our study. The risks associated with the transportation of critically-ill patients out of the intensive care unit as well as those from ionizing radiation exposure during childhood were unacceptable.",

            "text": "The proposed method, of course, has important limitations. First, the method is limited to detecting reversible atelectasis, since EIT image reconstruction is currently best-suited to measure impedance changes rather than absolute measurements. Consequently, only lung regions that exhibit some airflow during the ventilation protocol can be identified. We also assume that the transverse area occupied by the lungs does not change appreciably during recruitment. Although CT studies of lung recruitment support this assumption [7] , [10] , [17] , its falsehood in a special case could affect the estimates of overdistension and atelectasis. Second, the processing steps following image reconstruction are relatively new and need further validation involving a broader range of patients with ALI/ARDS and different EIT systems. Making the programming sequence available to all centers is perhaps the most effective way to evaluate and optimize EIT-guided mechanical ventilation strategies for patients in respiratory distress. Although advanced alternatives to fEIT thresholding have been proposed for lung detection, e.g., least-squares regression [37] (supplement), [33] , principal component analysis [38] , and fuzzy logic pattern recognition [39] , we reasoned that standard fEIT thresholding would serve as a good benchmark because its limitations are well understood, and it will challenge new methods remain as simple, automatic and fast as possible. The calculations for regional lung mechanics have only been demonstrated in two case studies of ARDS in adults [15] and, therefore, will also require further evaluation in both adults and children. Third, the method will systematically underestimate the \"true\" static respiratory system compliance, which is best obtained from the quasi-static pressure-volume curve, where pressure and volume measurements are made during the best practical approximation of zero flow [24] . Quasi-static pressure-volume maneuvers are unfortunately difficult to perform and require ventilator disconnect, making the risk-to-benefit ratio for ALI/ARDS patients unattractive.",

Therefore, the aforementioned challenges in data compatibility must be overcome before EIT-guided ventilation can be tested in terms of clinical outcomes, in particular, measures of morbidity and mortality. We recommend that the proposed approach be used as a framework for evaluating and improving each step of the sequence with the purpose of interactively guiding mechanical ventilation of the ALI/ARDS patient with EIT.",
