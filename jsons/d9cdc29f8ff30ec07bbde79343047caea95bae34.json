            "text": "Coronavirus (CoV) nucleocapsid (N) proteins are key for incorporating genomic RNA into progeny viral particles. In infected cells, N proteins are present at the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs), the sites of CoV RNA synthesis. It has been shown that N proteins are important for viral replication and that the one of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a commonly used model CoV, interacts with nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a component of the RTCs. These two aspects of the CoV life cycle, however, have not been linked. We found that the MHV N protein binds exclusively to nsp3 and not other RTC components by using a systematic yeast two-hybrid approach, and we identified two distinct regions in the N protein that redundantly mediate this interaction. A selective N protein variant carrying point mutations in these two regions fails to bind nsp3 in vitro, resulting in inhibition of its recruitment to RTCs in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild-type N protein, this N protein variant impairs the stimulation of genomic RNA and viral mRNA transcription in vivo and in vitro, which in turn leads to impairment of MHV replication and progeny production. Altogether, our results show that N protein recruitment to RTCs, via binding to nsp3, is an essential step in the CoV life cycle because it is critical for optimal viral RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE CoVs have long been regarded as relatively harmless pathogens for humans. Severe respiratory tract infection outbreaks caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, however, have caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in humans. These outbreaks highlighted the relevance of being able to control CoV infections. We used a model CoV, MHV, to investigate the importance of the recruitment of N protein, a central component of CoV virions, to intracellular platforms where CoVs replicate, transcribe, and translate their genomes. By identifying the principal binding partner at these intracellular platforms and generating a specific mutant, we found that N protein recruitment to these locations is crucial for promoting viral RNA synthesis. Moreover, blocking this recruitment strongly inhibits viral infection. Thus, our results explain an important aspect of the CoV life cycle and reveal an interaction of viral proteins that could be targeted in antiviral therapies.",

The characterization of this interaction has allowed us to experimentally block it and thereby to determine its relevance for the CoV life cycle. We found that N protein indeed is recruited to the RTCs by interacting with nsp3. Using an in vitro binding approach, we showed that regions in the N1b and N2a domains of MHV N protein mediate the binding to nsp3 in a gRNA-independent manner. Importantly, we identified and created specific N protein point mutations that block its binding to nsp3 in vitro, and we found that this association is necessary for N protein recruitment and function at the RTCs in vivo. At the RTCs, the nsp3-mediation-recruited N protein is required for the stimulation of gRNA replication and sgmRNA transcription. Indeed, inhibition of the N protein-nsp3 interaction severely impairs viral replication and egression. Altogether, our data demonstrate that N protein interaction with nsp3 is a critical step for MHV replication, and its targeting could represent a valid anticoronaviral therapy.",

For this purpose, the N protein of MHV and all 16 nsps were cloned into a vector carrying the activation domain (AD) or the DNA binding domain (BD), respectively, of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor (42) . Each plasmid encoding a BD-nsp fusion protein was transformed together with the one expressing the AD-N chimera into the Y2H test strain, and growth of the cotransformed cells on a medium lacking histidine was used to assess interaction. As shown in Fig. 1B , this approach revealed that MHV N protein bound mainly to nsp3, in agreement with the previous findings (40, 41, 43) , and to a far lesser extent to nsp4.

In those studies, however, purified nsp3 N was incubated with cell extracts from MHV-infected cells. As a result, this approach cannot exclude the possibility that N protein interacts indirectly with nsp3, i.e., via either a cellular protein or another viral protein, and thus a different factor could be involved in N protein recruitment to the RTCs. Therefore, we first examined whether the N protein and nsp3 bind directly, using in vitro binding experiments. The nsp3 N fragment was fused to glutathione transferase (GST), expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified using glutathione (GSH) conjugated to Sepharose beads. To prove that our purified nsp3 N fragment retained its overall conformation, GST or GST-nsp3 N was first incubated with cell extracts obtained from noninfected and MHV-infected LR7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C and consistent with the literature (41) , the N protein specifically bound to GST-nsp3 N but not to GST alone. We also tested whether association with RNA was influencing N protein binding to nsp3 N , because this parameter could be relevant for the follow-up in vitro studies with recombinant proteins. Therefore, cell extracts from infected cells were treated with RNase A or with this enzyme plus a specific RNase A inhibitor before being incubated with GST-nsp3 N or GST. Importantly, removal of RNA did not alter N protein interaction with nps3 N (Fig. 1C) .",

            "text": "between amino acid 233 and amino acid 250, which contains the SR-rich region. To elaborate further on this, we generated three truncated forms, i.e., N1a-N1b/NTD (amino acids 1 to 194), N2a (amino acids 195 to 257), and N2b-N3/CTD (amino acids 258 to 454) (Fig. 1A) . These truncated forms were fused with the 6\u03ebHis tag and expressed in E. coli before preparation of bacterial cell extracts, which were then incubated with either GST or GST-nsp3 N . As expected and as shown in Fig. 2B , none of the fusion proteins interacted with GST. In contrast, binding of GST-nsp3 N with 6\u03ebHis-N1a-N1b was detected, as suggested previously (45), but not with 6\u03ebHis-N2a or 6\u03ebHis-N2b-N3. Because interaction between nsp3 and N2a was reported previously (40, 41) and was shown to possess weak affinity (44) , we repeated the pulldown experiments with GST-nps3 N and 6\u03ebHis-N2a and exposed the Western blot membranes for a longer time (Fig. 2C ). This approach allowed detection of the binding between nps3 N and N2a, in agreement with our Y2H analysis of the truncated N proteins ( Fig. 2A) . This result shows that motifs in two different regions of the N protein, i.e., N1a-N1b and to a much smaller extent N2a, are mediating its binding to nsp3. In order to identify these motifs and to study their relationship, we aligned the amino acid sequences of the N1-N2a segment of the N proteins from different betacoronaviruses and examined their distribution on the three-dimensional structure of the MHV N1-N2a domain (24) . As highlighted in Fig. 3A , we found six stretches of amino acids that were both conserved and on the surface of the N1-N2a segment, thus making them available for interaction. Four of these amino acid stretches were localized in the N1 region and two in the N2a fragment. We changed the conserved polar and charged amino acids to alanines and the conserved nonpolar amino acids to aspartates in each one of these different sequences, creating mutated versions of the 6\u03ebHistagged N protein truncated forms, i.e., N2a m1 (amino acids 195 to 257, with L240E, V241E, and L242E substitutions), N2a m2 (amino acids 195 to 257, with S197A, R202A, S203A, and S205A substitutions), N1 m3 (amino acids 1 to 194, with T73A, Q74A, and K77A substitutions), N1 m4 (amino acids 1 to 194, with K101A, Y103A, and W104A substitutions), N1 m5 (amino acids 1 to 194, with R109A, R110A, and K113A substitutions), and N1 m6 (amino acids 1 to 194, with F128A, Y129A, Y130A, and T133A substitutions) (Fig. 3A ). Of note, the S205A change in the N2a m2 variant alters the priming site that is essential for SR-rich region phosphorylation by host cell GSK-3 (32, 46) . Cell extracts obtained from E. coli strains expressing these constructs were incubated with either GST or GST-nsp3 N . Although N1 m3 and N1 m5 bound GST-nsp3 N with the same affinity as wild-type N1, we found that the other mutated truncated forms displayed strong reductions in interaction with GST-nsp3 N (Fig. 3B ). We concluded that amino acids at positions 101 to 104 and 129 to 133 and at positions 194 to 202 and 240 to 242 play roles in the interaction of nsp3 with N1 and N2a, respectively (Fig. 3B ). This result also revealed that the SR-rich region that is phosphorylated in vivo is not important for N protein binding to nsp3.",

Thus, to determine whether the single mutations in N1 or N2a are sufficient to block the N1-N2a interaction with nsp3 N , we expressed the N1-N2a m1 , N1-N2a m2 , N1-N2a m4 , and N1-N2a m6 variants in E. coli before incubation of bacterial extracts with either GST or GST-nsp3 N . As shown in Fig. 3C , all constructs specifically bound GST-nsp3 N with the same affinity as wild-type N1-N2a. This finding showed that the binding of MHV N protein to nsp3 is not mediated by a single domain and thus the domains might be redundant in the binding function, as contemplated in the second scenario.",

This finding shows that two different regions mediate MHV N protein binding to nsp3. From here, we continued with the analysis of the N m4m1 and N m6m1 mutants to specifically study the N protein-nsp3 interaction. The nsp3 BDs of the N protein are not involved in its self-assembly and oligomerization. We and others recently showed that CoV N proteins form oligomers constitutively (22, 23) . Therefore, a possible scenario that could not be excluded a priori was that the introduced substitutions in the N protein were affecting its organization into oligomers, which might indirectly impair binding to nsp3. To investigate whether the mutated N proteins that showed reduced nsp3 binding, i.e., N m4m1 and N m6m1 (Fig.  4A ), had a defect in self-interaction, we analyzed their self-binding. Bacterial extracts from E. coli expressing 6\u03ebHis-tagged N, N m4m1 , or N m6m1 were incubated with GST or GST-N protein. As shown in Fig. 4B , 6\u03ebHis-N, 6\u03ebHis-N m4m1 , and 6\u03ebHis-N m6m1 proteins specifically interacted with GST-N protein.",

The distribution of the N m4m1 oligomer over the gradient differed slightly, compared to that of the wild-type oligomer, i.e., the signal was present mainly in fractions 6 and 7, suggesting that the protein assembled predominately in larger oligomers. Importantly, the oligomerization of the N m6m1 variant was similar to that of the N protein, as the oligomer was detected mainly in fractions 4 to 7 ( Fig. 4C and D) .

To establish whether the inability of the N protein to interact with nsp3 led to altered subcellular localization over the course of an infection, we first attempted to generate mutant MHV strains using two different approaches. First, we opted to generate recombinant MHV expressing an additional copy of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged N or N m6m1 by inserting the coding sequences of these two fusion proteins into the viral locus of the nonessential hemagglutinin esterase gene (39) . The N m6m1 mutant was chosen because it oligomerizes similarly to the wild-type N protein (Fig. 4D) . We tried three times to generate an MHV-N m6m1 -GFP chimeric strain using this approach but, although we obtained the control MHV-N-GFP strain each time, we were unable to recover the mutant virus. Second, we turned to a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetics system to introduce the N m6m1 mutation in the viral N locus (47) . With this approach as well, the wild-type strain but not the mutant strain was obtained in two attempts. Because genomic expression of N m6m1 appeared to be lethal for the virus, we decided to opt for a different strategy. We expressed mCherry, mCherry-N, or mCherry-N m6m1 fusion proteins in mouse LR7 cells before exposing the cells to MHV. mCherry, mCherry-N, and mCherry-N m6m1 were homogenously distributed in the cytoplasm in noninfected cells (data not shown). In contrast, MHV-infected cells displayed numerous distinct cytoplasmic puncta that were positive for both nsp2 and nsp3 (data not shown); these puncta were previously shown to represent RTCs (39) . Interestingly, wild-type mCherry-N but not mCherry-N m6m1 or mCherry alone was recruited to these nsp2/nsp3-positive RTCs (data not shown).",

Therefore, we decided to turn to the human HeLa-CEACAM1a cell line, which expresses the MHV cell receptor CEACAM1a and is highly transfectable (48) . As expected, the GFP, GFP-N, and GFP-N m6m1 constructs were efficiently transfected into HeLa-CEACAM1a cells, with around 80% of the cells displaying the fluorescent signal. In agreement with the results obtained with LR7 cells, GFP, GFP-N, and GFP-N m6m1 fusion proteins were homogenously distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A) and MHV infection caused a redistribution of GFP-N to the nsp2/nsp3-positive RTCs (Fig. 5A, fifth row) . This observation confirmed that ectopically expressed GFP-tagged N protein behaved like the protein encoded by the viral gRNA over the course of an infection. Surprisingly, we found that a large number of cells expressing GFP-N m6m1 did not display nsp2/nsp3- positive RTCs (Fig. 5B) , indicating that this construct has a dominant negative effect on viral replication. In a very few cases (approximately 4% of the cells expressing GFP-N m6m1 ), RTCs were present in the same number and had a similar size as in cells expressing GFP-N (data not shown) but GFP-N m6m1 was not recruited onto the RTCs ( Fig. 5A and C) . Altogether, these results show that N protein binding to nsp3 is required for its recruitment to the RTCs and possibly also for MHV RNA synthesis and replication.",

To determine whether blocking N protein recruitment to the RTCs led to a defect in the CoV life cycle, we performed a series of experiments to examine whether N m6m1 indeed had a dominant negative effect on MHV replication and/or assembly/egression. We took advantage of the MHV-2aFLS strain, which carries the genes encoding firefly luciferase and allows assessment of viral replication by monitoring the activity of this enzyme (49) . We transfected the plasmids expressing GFP, GFP-N, or GFP-N m6m1 fusion protein into HeLa-CEACAM1a cells for 48 h before exposing the cells to different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of MHV-2aFLS, i.e., MOIs of 2.5, 5, and 10, and measuring luciferase activity at 7 h postinfection (p.i.). As shown in Fig. 6A , expression of wild-type N protein promoted viral replication over time after exposure to different amounts of virus, as expected (26) (27) (28) (29) . Very interestingly, there was a significant decrease in luciferase expression in cells transfected with GFP-N m6m1 , compared to those expressing GFP-N as well as those expressing GFP alone, showing that GFP-N m6m1 cannot promote viral replication like the wild-type protein; on the contrary, it has a dominant negative effect. Using the same approach, we explored whether the presence of N m6m1 had a permanent negative effect on viral replication or was just retarding it. For this purpose, cells transfected with the various constructs were infected with MHV-2aFLS at a MOI of 5 and luciferase activity was measured at 5, 7, and 9 h p.i. (Fig. 6B and data not shown) . In this experiment as well, the GFP-N chimera stimulated replication over time and at all the examined time points, while GFP-N m6m1 had a pronounced inhibitory effect on MHV replication.",

An advantage of in vitro assays is that proteins and other components can be easily added, to determine their effects on viral RNA synthesis. First, osmotically lysed MHV-infected cells were centrifuged at 13,000 \u03eb g to separate dense membranes containing RTCs (13,000 \u03eb g pellet [P13]) from the cytosol (13,000 \u03eb g supernatant [S13]). As expected, the ER integral membrane protein VAP-A was found entirely in the P13 fraction, while cytoplasmic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was found mainly in the S13 fraction (Fig. 7B) . To confirm the enrichment of RTCs in the P13 fraction, we probed the samples with anti-N antibodies and, as expected (50), RTCs were exclusively detected in the P13 fraction. Next, we tested the best experimental conditions for detection of RNA synthesis by MHV RTCs in vitro. Similar to the protocol established for SARS CoV (50), the P13 fractions from MHV-infected and noninfected cells were mixed with nucleoside triphosphates, an ATP-regenerating system, and actinomycin D, a potent inhibitor of host cellular transcription. To assess the synthesis of both sgmRNA and gRNA, we employed quantitative RT-PCR instead of labeling using radioactive nucleoside triphosphates (50) . The IVRS assays showed that viral RNA was more effectively synthesized when the P13 fraction from MHV-infected cells (P13-MHV) was present in the reaction mixtures (Fig. 7C) . Since it was shown that host factors that are present in the S13 fraction are required for viral RNA synthesis in vitro (50), we added S13 from infected cells and compared the viral RNA synthesis rate with that of samples not containing S13 (Fig. 7C, column 2 versus  column 3) . Interestingly, we did not observe an enhancement of viral RNA synthesis in the presence of S13 from infected cells, indicating that the P13 fraction was sufficient to sustain IVRS (Fig. 7C ). Subsequently we explored whether adding different amounts of N protein to the IVRS assay enhanced viral transcription. As shown in Fig. 7D , we found that 1 g of protein extract from N protein-expressing bacteria provided the maximal stimulation of MHV RTC-mediated viral RNA synthesis. Smaller amounts of the bacterial extracts had less pronounced effects, while larger amounts had an inhibitory impact.",

            "text": "A few approaches have shown that nsp3 interacts with the N protein, but the molecular details of the binding between these two proteins remained to be clarified because of inconsistent conclusions. Hurst and colleagues exploited genetic approaches both to identify nsp3 as a binding partner of MHV N protein and to show that the cytoplasmic N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of nsp3 and the SR-rich region of the N2a domain of the N protein may be important for this interaction (40, 41) . They also provided in vitro evidence that N protein association with RNA is not relevant for its interaction with the N terminus of nsp3 (40, 41) . A solution study using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry found that the N1b-N2a fragment, but not N1b and N2a individually, bound nsp3 with high affinity (44) . Consistent with the other studies, this result indicates that at least one nsp3binding determinant is localized to the SR-rich-region-containing N2a domain of the N protein (40, 41) . This domain alone, however, is not sufficient to maintain high-affinity binding to nsp3, which suggests the presence of one or more interaction domains in the N1b-N2a fragment (44) . Using in silico modeling, it was recently concluded that two regions in the N1b domain of MHV N protein, containing the residues Lys113, Arg125, and Tyr127 and the residues Glu173 and Tyr190, are involved in N protein-nsp3 association (45) . Our detailed examination of the association between purified nsp3 N and different N variants using in vitro pulldown experiments confirms the previous observations, because it demonstrates that indeed both N1b and N2a interact with nsp3 N , with N1b having stronger binding affinity than N2a (Fig. 2) . In particular, we found that, when concomitantly mutated, two sets of amino acids in N1b (K101/Y103/ W104 and F128/Y129/Y130/T133) and two in N2a (S197/R202/S203/S205A and L240/ V241/L242) led to a defect in the interaction of these domains with nsp3 N . Interestingly, a single set of substitutions in either the N1b or N2a region did not yield a major defect in the association between the N1-N2a fragment and nsp3 N (Fig. 3C) , indicating a redundancy in the binding of the two protein domains. In agreement with this notion, the combination of substitutions in the N1b and N2a regions completely blocked the interaction between full-length MHV N and nsp3 N (Fig. 4A) .",

            "text": "What is the relevance of N protein-nsp3 interaction in the CoV life cycle? Cotransfection of MHV N protein mRNA and gRNA led to a significant increase in infectivity, compared to transfection with gRNA alone (41) . A similar beneficial role of N protein for infection has been shown for other CoVs as well (26, 27) . Despite these observations, the mechanism of how CoV N proteins stimulate CoV infections has remained unknown. To the best of our knowledge, our data are the first to reveal that the direct association of N protein with RTCs is a critical step for MHV infection, because the impairment of this interaction had negative effects on MHV replication and progeny production ( Fig. 5 and 6 ). This notion is also indirectly supported by the fact that it was not possible to generate MHV mutant strains expressing N m6m1 , using two distinct approaches. In particular, we found that N m6m1 expression in host cells has a dominant negative effect on the MHV life cycle. Our interpretation of this result is that ectopically expressed N m6m1 outcompetes the virus-encoded N protein, especially early during infection, when the first RTCs are formed. This leads to the formation of N protein oligomers that are principally composed of N m6m1 and thus are unable to be effectively recruited to RTCs. Furthermore, we show that wild-type N protein that is correctly recruited to RTCs promotes local viral RNA synthesis, i.e., gRNA replication and sgmRNA transcription, in vivo and in vitro ( Fig. 7 and data not shown) . In contrast, the nsp3binding mutant N m6m1 is not able to do so. This finding reveals that N protein recruitment to and association with RTCs are critical for the optimal functioning of these complexes in viral RNA synthesis and ultimately infection.",

As a result, a speculative idea is that phosphorylation of the SR-rich region, which is part of the N2a domain, triggers recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX1 (32) but also abrogates one of the interactions between the N protein and nsp3. The latter event could help to accommodate the RNA helicase DDX1 in the N protein-RTC complexes and/or to promote the transition into the transcription mode by influencing the ultrastructural organization of the N protein-RTC complexes.",

It remains unclear, however, how and why the N protein orchestrates viral RNA synthesis. A speculative idea is that the N protein-nsp3 interaction induces enzymatic activities and/or provides a more structured conformation of the complexes, positively influencing protein-RNA interactions at the RTCs. This could guarantee sufficient production of structural proteins necessary to efficiently encapsulate the newly formed ribonucleoprotein complexes into virions. Our current working model is that N proteins probably oligomerize in the cytosol and then are recruited to RTCs, which are present at the DMVs and convoluted membranes, through the binding to nsp3 (Fig. 8) . At the RTCs, the N oligomers stimulate viral RNA synthesis. While local production of gRNA and the presence of N oligomers may promote the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes, newly transcribed sgmRNA would guarantee sufficient synthesis of structural proteins. In contrast, N m6m1containing oligomers cannot be efficiently recruited to the RTCs, and viral RNA synthesis fails to be stimulated (Fig. 8) , resulting in strongly impaired CoV infection.",

To inhibit cellular transcription, 2 g/ml actinomycin D (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) was present in all solutions used for harvesting and washing of the cells. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM magnesium acetate [MgOAc 2 ], 1 mM DTT, 133 U/ml RNase A inhibitor [Promega] ) and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. Cells were disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer, with 30 strokes with a tight-fitting pestle. Isotonic conditions were restored by adding HEPES, sucrose, and DTT, which resulted in a final lysate containing 35 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 250 mM sucrose, 8 mM KCl, 2.5 mM DTT, 1 mM MgOAc 2 , 2 g/ml actinomycin D, and 130 U/ml RNase A inhibitor. Nuclei, large debris, and any remaining intact cells were removed by two successive centrifugations at 1,000 \u03eb g for 5 min, and the resulting postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was either assayed immediately for RTC activity or stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C. P13 and S13 fractions were prepared from the PNS by centrifugation at 13,000 \u03eb g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The P13 was resuspended in dilution buffer (35 mM HEPES [pH 7.4] , 250 mM sucrose, 8 mM KCl, 2.5 mM DTT, 1 mM MgOAc 2 , 2 g/ml actinomycin D, 130 U/ml RNase A inhibitor), in one-ninth of the original PNS volume from which the pellet had been prepared.",

Identical levels of expression of these two fusion proteins in bacterial extracts used for the IVRS assays were verified by Western blotting using an anti-6\u03ebHis monoclonal antibody. Pure proteins could not be used because they were unstable and thus were partially degraded during the purification procedure. The total volume of each mixture was adjusted to 75 l with dilution buffer, and two 25-l aliquots were made from this mixture; 5.6 l of 100 mM creatine phosphate (Sigma; final concentration, 20 mM) and 0.28 l of 1,000 U/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma; final concentration, 10 U/ml) were added to both of these aliquots. The IVRS assay was initiated in one of these aliquots (reaction sample) with the addition of nucleoside triphosphates (final concentrations of 1 mM ATP, 0.25 mM GTP, 0.25 mM UTP, and 0.18 mM CTP). The second aliquot served as a control (background sample), and dilution buffer was added instead of the nucleoside triphosphates. The IVRS assays were carried out at 30\u00b0C for 100 min before being stopped with the addition first of 30 l of lysis buffer containing DNase I at room temperature for 5 min and then of 3 l of stop solution for 3 min at the same temperature (both solutions from the Power SYBR green Cells-to-CT kit; Thermo Fisher). Reverse transcription of the RNA, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative PCR were performed in a CFX Connect thermocycler using appropriate primers. The expression levels of the S gene, which is part of the viral RNA (both sgmRNA and gRNA), were normalized to that of GAPDH in each sample, according to the comparative cycle threshold method used for quantification, as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. Finally, the value of each background sample was subtracted from the value of the corresponding reaction sample to determine the difference due to in vitro S gene synthesis.",
