The family Coronaviridae is organized into two subfamilies, Orthocoronavirinae and Letovirinae, with the former including four different genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. Canine coronavirus (CCoV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus and forms a unique species, Alphacoronavirus\u20101, along with feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV), and its derivative, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) (Decaro & Buonavoglia, 2008, 2011).",

In most cases pCCoV was found in association with co\u2010pathogens, including canine parvovirus (CPV) (Alfano et al., 2019; Decaro et al., 2012, 2013; Ntafis et al., 2012; Pinto et al., 2014; Zicola et al., 2012) and canine adenovirus type 1 (CAdV\u20101) (Alfano et al., 2019).",

At post\u2010mortem examination, the analysed dogs showed catarrhal or hemorrhagic enteritis (n = 137), enlargement of the mesenteric lymph nodes (n = 79), pneumonia or other pulmonary lesions (n = 70), and meningeal and/or encephalic hyperaemia (n = 49).

In this study, we examined 352 dogs and identified 35 putative pCCoV\u2010infected animals, thus showing a wide distribution of this emerging virus. Twenty\u2010eight of the putative pCCoV\u2010infected dogs displayed double, triple or quadruple co\u2010infections with other viral pathogens. Therefore, in most cases, the identification of other pathogens in the same animals does not allow a clear association between the detected pCCoV strains and the death of the animals. Even for 7 dogs (two juvenile dogs and five pups), in which no associations with other viral pathogens were demonstrated, there is no definitive evidence that pCCoV was the cause of their death. In fact, previous studies have demonstrated that this virus is frequently associated to subclinical infections and impairment of the lymphocyte counts, rather than to severe clinical signs and death of the infected dogs (Marinaro et al., 2010). Most of the pCCoV\u2010positive animals also displayed post\u2010mortem findings accounting for a systemic involvement, but at which extent those lesions were induced by pCCoV or by other co\u2010pathogens, including the highly pathogenic CPV, CAdV\u20101 and CDV, infecting the same dogs could not be assessed.",

As a consequence, only the detection of a CCoV\u2010IIa strain in extraintestinal tissues accounts for a possible pCCoV infection in dogs. This situation is similar to that observed in calicivirus infections in cats, where markers of pathogenicity have been not yet detected in highly virulent strains, so that diagnosis of systemic calicivirosis is obtained when the virus is detected in extrarespiratory tissues (Caringella et al., 2019).",

Surprisingly, 3 pCCoVs (98960\u20101, 98960\u20103, 98960\u20104) clustered with viruses detected in wildlife or domestic cats in Asia (Wang, Ma, Lu, & Wen, 2006). These strains were from dogs illegally imported from an unknown country, which highlights the role of illegal trade of dogs in the introduction of pathogens into Italy (Decaro et al., 2007; Mira et al., 2018).",

            "text": "An additional finding of the present study is the high frequency of co\u2010infections with pCCoV and other viruses. Enteric CCoV infections in dogs are very frequent (Decaro & Buonavoglia, 2008; Decaro et al., 2008; Pratelli et al., 2003; Priestnall, Pratelli, Brownlie, & Erles, 2007). Co\u2010infection by CPV and CCoV in dogs is known to enhance the severity of clinical signs (Decaro, Elia, et al., 2006; Evermann, Abbott, & Han, 2005; Pratelli, 2006), with fatal outcomes being frequently reported in pups (Decaro, Elia, et al., 2006). A high frequency of co\u2010infections with pCCoV and other pathogens has been previously reported (Alfano et al., 2019; Decaro et al., 2013; Ntafis et al., 2012; Pinto et al., 2014; Zicola et al., 2012). In the present study, we found a significant association of pCCoV with CPV and CAdV\u20102 infections. Pantropic CCoV is able to affect lymphocyte counts, thus causing a prolonged lymphopenia, so that it has been postulated that pCCoV infection may predispose to the increase in virulence of other pathogens by inducing immunosuppression in the infected dogs (Marinaro et al., 2010).",

Therefore, it is strongly recommended to vaccinate not only private\u2010owned dogs but also stray dogs whenever possible. In addition, the epidemiological risk related to the legal and illegal trade of carnivores from Asian countries must be taken into account, since this trade may represent a source of several emerging pathogens in domestic and wild canids (Mira et al., 2018, 2019).",
