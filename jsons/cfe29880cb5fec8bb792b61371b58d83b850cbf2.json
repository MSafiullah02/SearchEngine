Emergence that leads to successful host switching may be classifi ed into three stages: (1) initial single infection of a new host with no onward transmission (i.e. spillovers into 'dead-end' hosts), (2) spillovers that go on to cause local chains of transmission in the new host population before epidemic fade-out (i.e. outbreaks) and (3) epidemic or sustained endemic host-to-host disease transmission in the new host population (Parrish et al. 2008 ) .",

There is no doubt, however, that the latter has opened the fl oodgates since viral genomes can now be generated at lower cost and much more rapidly than was possible using conventional sequencing approaches. The number of viral genomes available in public databases continues to increase exponentially. This wealth of data has led to signifi cant progress in terms of rapid identifi cation and characterisation of emerging viruses, as well as knowledge about their biodiversity and evolution. In terms of evolutionary biology, the beauty of working in viral genomics lies in the ability to study evolutionary changes on the same time scales as the events that shape them. For several viruses, historical samples are available for retrospective study, and their analysis has contributed to our understanding of viral evolutionary and epidemiological factors/events accompanying their emergence, maintenance and spatial diffusion (reviewed in (Pybus and Rambaut 2009 ) ).",

Although disease emergence in other species can be of equal importance and ultimately impacts on human development, for the purpose of brevity, I concentrate primarily on diseases that have emerged in human populations and draw examples from those that have most deeply affected the developing world. While there is no apparent relationship between the tendency for new human pathogens to be reported and a country's geographic location or level of development (Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007 ) , inadequate public health surveillance and response systems in developing countries coupled with the existence of underlying disease conditions have meant that disease burden is usually greater in developing than developed countries (as well illustrated by the recent H1N1 pandemic, (Archer et al. 2009 ) ). Additionally, prevention and control strategies that are effective in more developed countries often fall short in resource-limited settings, which can then act as pockets of refuge where pathogens persist, and may serve as future source populations for outbreaks in other regions.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that preventing viral disease emergence in human populations begins with a systematic survey of viral diversity in animal populations (Wolfe et al. 2007 ) . Such knowledge would enable identifi cation of animal populations harbouring viruses that have previously infected humans or that are likely to do so by virtue of their relatedness to known human pathogens, or perhaps their ability to infect human cell lines . Zoonotic viruses generally cause little or no apparent disease in their original hosts; thus animal reservoirs are often not obvious. Since it is clearly impossible to survey all animal species, the focus of animal surveillance should be on species that are more likely to harbour potentially emergent viruses, for example species with large and/or dense populations, and in particular those that live in close proximity to and are more closely related to humans and their domestic mammals, such as rodents, bats and birds . Non-human primate populations (regardless of their size or population density) are also worth surveying because of their close evolutionary relationship with humans and the fact that a number of important human pathogens have emerged from them (e.g. dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV) and HIV). Finally, any other species having direct (e.g. bushmeat, livestock) or indirect contact (e.g. vector-mediated contact) with humans that could have led to human infections in the past should also be included (Wolfe et al. 2007 ) . Traditional approaches to virus discovery such as electron microscopy, cell culture, animal inoculation studies and serology (Storch 2007 ) have a number of limitations, the most important being that not all viruses can be cultured in the laboratory (Amann et al. 1995 ) . There are now a range of sensitive molecular approaches to virus discovery that circumvent this problem by relying on detection and characterisation of viral genomes rather than targeting viral particles, antigens or their cytopathic effects (reviewed in Bexfi eld 2011 ). These include hybridisation-, PCR-and sequence-based approaches that have varying levels of reliance on sequence information from known pathogens and thus differ in terms of the range of pathogens they would be expected to detect. For example, hybridisation-based techniques (such as microarray (Wang et al. 2002 ) and subtractive hybridisation (Lisitsyn et al. 1993 ) ) require sequence information from known pathogens to detect related pathogens and are unable to detect completely novel virus families. Likewise, PCRbased approaches using degenerate primers are limited to amplifi cation and detection of related viruses. However, there are also sequence independent PCR approaches that facilitate detection of completely novel pathogens. These include sequence-independent single primer amplifi cation (SISPA), degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR, random PCR and rolling circle amplifi cation (reviewed in Bexfi eld 2011 ). When these approaches are coupled with 'next-generation' sequencing technology (Margulies et al. 2005 ) such as 454 pyrosequencing (Roche), Illumina (Solexa) and SoLiD\u2122 (Applied Biosystems) for defi nitive identifi cation of amplifi ed fragments, they very effi ciently generate large amounts of sequence data that can then be analysed using bioinformatic tools.",

This approach involves deep sequencing of viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNA) produced by host immune machinery in response to infection. vsiRNAs are produced by cutting up viral genomes, so piecing their sequences together recovers the virus sequence. In addition to being a sequence independent approach, the process is expected to be more effi cient since only a small proportion of host small RNAs need to be sequenced and data-mined (Wu et al. 2010 ) . Additionally, since vdSAR assembles viral genomes from the products of an active host immune response to infection, only replicating and infectious viruses that induce the immune response are identifi ed by this approach (Wu et al. 2010 ) .",

In March 2003, traditional cell culture resulted in the isolation of a novel virus from patient specimens (Drosten et al. 2003 ; Ksiazek et al. 2003 ; Peiris et al. 2003 ) . Within days of this, the virus was identifi ed as a coronavirus through the use of a pan viral microarray and confi rmed by sequencing using two parallel approaches. The fi rst involved designing primers based on known coronaviruses and amplifying regions of the novel virus, and in the second, viral sequences were directly recovered from the surface of the microarray to which they were hybridised, cloned and sequenced without the need to design specifi c primers (Wang et al. 2003 ) . Comparison with previously characterised coronavirus strains demonstrated that the virus identifi ed was distinct from all known human pathogens (Wang et al. 2003 ) . Thus within 24 h, an unknown virus was identifi ed as a coronavirus and within days partial genome sequences had been generated. Comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses also played the major role in pinpointing bats as the source of the precursor to the SARS virus and the primary reservoirs for SARS-like coronaviruses (Dominguez et al. 2007 ; Gloza-Rausch et al. 2008 ; Lau et al. 2005 ; Poon et al. 2005 ; Tang et al. 2006 ; Tong 2009 ; Woo et al. 2006 ; Carrington et al. 2008 ) .",

            "text": "As sequencing costs continue to fall and computing capacity improves, metagenomic approaches to virus detection and characterisation will no doubt become more and more routine aspects of public health activities. Researchers have demonstrated the potential utility of high-throughput pyrosequencing for the detection of viruses in human clinical specimens such as stool (Nakamura et al. 2009 ) , nasopharyngeal swabs (Bogaert et al. 2011 ; Nakamura et al. 2009 ) , autopsy-derived liver and kidney tissues (Palacios et al. 2008 ) and serum (Briese et al. 2009 ) . This includes identifi cation of novel viruses associated with high mortality outbreaks of unknown aetiology (Briese et al. 2009 ) and in tissues from individuals who died following organ transplantation from the same donor (Palacios et al. 2008 ) . Others have demonstrated the potential usefulness of metagenomic sequencing in fi eld surveillance for arboviruses by applying the technique to mosquitoes experimentally infected with dengue virus (Bishop-Lilly et al. 2010 ) . It has even been suggested that metagenomic sequencing may be used for continual surveillance of large human populations for known and unknown viral pathogens (Anderson et al. 2003 ) . The suggestion is that large pooled samples of human serum and plasma (possibly discarded specimens from diagnostic laboratories) could be enriched for viral particles and then subjected to metagenomic sequencing on a routine basis. Such large-scale continual surveillance could allow identifi cation of viruses that have entered the human population even before the usual detection thresholds (which would normally depend on several people being infected) have been reached. According to the authors, this approach could be used to 'monitor the levels of known viruses, rapidly detect outbreaks and systematically discover novel or variant human viruses' (Anderson et al. 2003 ) .",

The barriers to onward transmission are primarily biological (Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007 ) . For example, tissue tropism or viral titres achieved might not allow for effi cient human-to-human transmission, or transmission might be restricted by reliance on a vector that does not commonly interact with humans or in which the virus does not achieve high enough titres to effi ciently infect humans.

VEEV, an arbovirus belonging to the genus Alphavirus , is usually maintained in an enzootic rodentmosquito-rodent cycle. An amino acid change (Thr \u2192 Arg) at position 213 in the E2 glycoprotein confers the ability to cause high titre viraemia in horses, whereas the wild type is either unable to replicate in horses or does so at very low titres (Anishchenko et al. 2006 ) . Likewise, the dramatic emergence of the CHIKV (another mosquito-borne alphavirus) in Asia has been linked to a single amino acid change in the envelope 1 glycoprotein (E1-A226V) of the Indian Ocean lineage responsible (de Lamballerie et al. 2008 ; Hapuarachchi et al. 2010 ; Kumar et al. 2008 ; Ng et al. 2009c ; Sam et al. 2009 ; Schuffenecker et al. 2006 ) .

The approach is based on a population genetic model known as the coalescent which describes the relationship between the shape of the genealogical tree of sampled sequences and the demographic history of the population from which they were sampled (i.e. rates of population growth and decline, extent of population subdivision and patterns of migration) (Kingman 1982 ; Griffi ths and Tavare 1994 ) . In the case of RNA viruses, exploiting this link between population dynamics and molecular evolution, i.e. exploring their 'phylodynamics', (Holmes 2009 ; Grenfell et al. 2004 ) is particularly attractive since their high mutation rates, short generation times and large populations sizes can result in signifi cant genetic differences between sequences sampled within years, months or even days of each other. Additionally, the relatively short time frames involved mean that evolutionary and demographic events may be temporally aligned with the immunological, transmission and ecological events that shaped them. Given date and location stamped sequences, and depending on the nature and spatiotemporal resolution of the sampling, it is then possible to estimate when and where a given epidemic began or particular lineages arose, the order and timing of transmission events, the timing of changes in population growth rates, and the pattern and rate of virus movement between geographic regions, epidemiological risk groups, individuals and even tissues within an individual (reviewed in (Pybus and Rambaut 2009 ) ).

While it may be the best estimate, the true genealogy is rarely, if ever, known with absolute certainty. One solution is to account for this uncertainty by using probabilistic models to estimate parameters over many, many plausible genealogies, thereby providing a more rigorous statistical framework. The most commonly used model is the Bayesian skyline plot (Drummond et al. 2005 ) incorporated into the BEAST software package (Drummond and Rambaut 2007 ) . This approach uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling procedure to derive a distribution of trees from which a distribution of population size estimates is determined at intervals going back to the most recent common ancestor of the gene sequences (Drummond and Rambaut 2007 ; Drummond et al. 2002 ) . The result is a plot of the estimated effective population size over time with credibility intervals that represent both phylogenetic and coalescent uncertainty (see Boxes 7.1 and 7.2 ). BEAST also jointly estimates substitution rates and divergence times (i.e. times to the most recent common ancestors of individual lineages and the genealogy as a whole) with credibility intervals and provides the option of using relaxed molecular clock models that allow",

DENV-4 was fi rst reported in 1981 and identifi ed as subtype II originating from Asia (Carrington et al. 2005 ; Lanciotti et al. 1997 ). In the same year, an Asian strain of DENV-2, distinct from the previously existing American subtype, was also reported (Deubel et al. 1986 ; Lewis et al. 1993 ; Twiddy et al. 2002 ) . Figure 7 .1 shows molecular clock phylogenies (top panel) and skyline plots (centre panel) estimated for the invading strains using sequences derived from DENV isolated from several countries in the Caribbean, South and Central America over about 20 years. Both skyline plots describe rapid exponential growth then maintenance of genetic diversity across epidemic peaks and troughs as estimated by the number of countries reporting DENV-2/-4 each year (bottom panel). This is likely a result of population subdivision, which is refl ected, for example, in the clustering of sequences from mainland (red) and island (blue) countries. Therefore, in this case, genetic diversity cannot be reliably interpreted as proportional to population size. The faster initial increase in genetic diversity for DENV-4 compared to DENV-2 may refl ect the immunological landscape, in that there was no herd immunity to DENV-4 in 1981, but another subtype of DENV-2 had already been circulating for many decades. The dates that the most recent common ancestors of each subtype existed are indicated by arrows along the x-axis of the skyline plot. They pre-date the fi rst epidemiological reports of each virus by about a year. This suggests that viruses remained undetected until the number of infections or disease incidence reached a detection threshold, which might be quite high given the inadequate surveillance in many countries. The y axes of the skyline plots represent relative genetic diversity, which is equal to the product of effective population size and generation length in the absence of population structure. For both viruses, the maximum a posteriori tree is presented on the same time scale as the skyline plot, with tip times corresponding to sampling times. The thick black lines are the median estimates, and the areas between the 95% CIs are shaded grey. Isolates on the trees are identifi ed by their country of origin; mainland countries are labelled in red and islands in blue, and the tips of the phylogenies correspond to their sampling times. The numbers of countries reporting DENV-2 and DENV-4 activity in each year are summarised in the histograms shown. In the case of DENV-2, this represents the activities of both subtype III and V, which are not distinguished in epidemiological reports (Figure reproduced ",

Figure 7 .2 shows (A) a skyline plot inferred from DENV4 sequences (~4,000 nucleotides) derived from viruses isolated in PR between 1981 and 1998. The pattern of cyclic epidemics described by the overlaid census data (number of confi rmed dengue cases) strongly correlates with the estimates of effective population size (derived using the Bayesian coalescent framework in the software package BEAST), with a 7-month lag (increases in population size precede outbreaks) that is adjusted for in Figure B . The reason for the observed time lag is unclear. It may be that increased diversity provides the variation from which more fi t, epidemic-causing strains are more likely to arise. Then during epidemics, diversity might be lost due to selection. Alternatively the discrepancy may be due to non-random and biased sampling in case counts and isolations (e.g. epidemiologic surveillance) (Bennett et al. 2010 ) .",

To address this limitation, a more realistic 'continuous trait' model that allows for diffusion over a continuous landscape was recently implemented ) . Box 7.3 illustrates the spatial spread of rabies virus amongst racoons in North America reconstructed using this model ) . In addition to those shown in , there are numerous other examples where a 'phylodynamic' approach to viral evolutionary analysis has been successfully applied. They include, for example, the reconstruction of the origin and global dissemination of HIV-1 (Gilbert et al. 2007 ; Korber et al. 2000 ; Vidal et al. 2000 ; Zhu et al. 1998 ) , reconstruction of the spread of rabies virus in North Africa with an investigation of factors underlying the patterns observed (Talbi et al. 2010 ) , inference of YFV and DENV spatial diffusion in the Americas (Auguste et al. 2010 ; Allicock et al. 2012 ) and investigation of the mechanism by which the YFV is maintained between epidemics (Auguste et al. 2010 ) and elucidation of the role of natural selection and global migration in infl uenza A epidemic patterns (Nelson et al. 2007 ; Rambaut et al. 2008 ; Russell et al. 2008 ) . Although this approach cannot replace good epidemiological data, it complements traditional epidemiological approaches and provides insights into the evolutionary dynamics underlying epidemic behaviour. The ability of the approach to recover information not available in census data (e.g. in the analysis described in Box 7.3 , the geographic area where the raccoon rabies virus is estimated to have spread by 1973 includes the location where the fi rst raccoon rabies case was reported in 1977 even though the data did not include a sequence for this case ) may be particularly useful in regions that have fl awed monitoring and surveillance systems, such as in the developing world.",

The data set consisted of 47 rabies virus genomic fragments (of 2,811 nucleotides in length) sampled from a 30-year epidemic (Biek et al. 2007 ) . Figure 7 .3 shows snapshots of the dispersal pattern at different time points as illustrated by a projection of the inferred rabies virus phylogeny onto a map. The shaded regions represent the uncertainty about the locations of the rabies. Interestingly the area contained in 1973 diffusion pattern includes the location of the fi rst raccoon rabies case reported in 1977 (green circle) even though the data do not include a sequence for this case. The changing tempo of the diffusion over time can be observed using the interactive animated visualisation available at www.phylogeography.org . Fig. 7 .3 Spatiotemporal dynamics of the rabies epidemic amongst North American raccoons. We provide snapshots of the dispersal pattern for August 1973 August , 1983 August , 1993 August and 2003 . Lines represent MCC phylogeny branches projected on the surface. The uncertainty on the location of raccoon rabies is represented by transparent polygons. These 80% highest posterior density regions are obtained by contouring a time-slice of the posterior phylogeny distribution and imputing the location on each branch in each phylogeny using the precision matrix parameters for the respective sample. The white-red colour gradient informs the relative age of the dispersal pattern (older recent). A green circle marks Pendleton County, WV, where the epizootic's fi rst case was reported in 1977. The maps are based on satellite pictures made available in Google Earth ( http://earth.google.com ). A dynamic visualisation of the spatiotemporal reconstruction can be explored at http://www.phylogeography.org/ ",

As described above, analysis of genomic data can provide valuable insights into virus evolution and epidemiology. The plethora of genomic sequence data being generated and the availability of rapid high-throughput sequencing technology therefore represent valuable resources that have already impacted on the way vaccine and therapeutic development is approached. In particular, they present the opportunity to understand the scope and distribution of the genomic diversity that must be tackled for a given virus and facilitate monitoring of the spatiotemporal dynamics of this biodiversity, thereby underpinning reverse vaccinology, pan-genomic and comparative genomic approaches to identifying vaccine and/or drug targets (Seib et al. 2009 ) (see Box 7.4 ) . Genomic approaches are also expected to accelerate the identifi cation of genetic and other molecular markers of prognostic and therapeutic relevance, such as markers of disease severity and drug resistance. Access to genomic data also enables researchers to go beyond genomics to transcriptomics, proteomics and other 'omics' approaches to studying emerging viruses.",

The current and potential impact of these and other dengue, HIV and infl uenza sequencing initiatives is well reviewed in Holmes 2009 . For dengue, in addition to the previously detailed insights into evolution and epidemiology, analyses suggest that some genotypes differ in virulence and/or fi tness (Armstrong and Rico-Hesse 2001 ; Bennett et al. 2003 ; Cologna et al. 2005 ; Cologna and Rico-Hesse 2003 ; Klungthong et al. 2004 ; Leitmeyer et al. 1999 ; Rico-Hesse et al. 1997 ; Sittisombut et al. 1997 ; Thu et al. 2004 ; Wittke et al. 2002 ; Zhang et al. 2005 ) and that immune-mediated natural selection may determine which genotypes survive (Adams et al. 2006 ) . Thus the fi tness of a given genotype may vary with the changing immunological landscape, which has major implications for vaccine development since tetravalent vaccines designed to induce immunity to all four DENV serotypes are unlikely to provide complete crossprotection (Whitehead et al. 2007 ) . For infl uenza virus, analysis of IGSP data has already altered basic concepts of infl uenza virus evolution and shed light on the evolution of drug resistance, identifi ed important source and sink populations and provided data on genomic diversity that will improve and accelerate the process of choosing which strains to incorporate into annual vaccines (reviewed in (Holmes 2009 ) ). HIV is perhaps the greatest disappointment in terms of our inability to arrive at a vaccine despite a wealth of genomic data on the virus. In this regard, the major lesson learned from viral genomics is that HIV is immensely diverse both within and between individual hosts ) and vaccines are likely to have to be location/population specifi c and require regular updating (Holmes 2009 ) .",

            "text": "The ability to generate viral genomes increasingly, rapidly and cheaply and the development of bioinformatic tools for analysing these data have transformed the study of emerging viruses. Metagenomic sequencing and evolutionary analyses will soon become routine diagnostic and surveillance tools, allowing us to detect and visualise viral emergence and spatiotemporal dynamics in real time. In addition to enabling rapid responses in terms of development of pathogen-specifi c screening tests, identifi cation of source populations and disease tracking, this will facilitate generation of hypotheses about evolutionary mechanisms and ecological factors underlying the patterns observed. However, despite the immense potential, addressing prevention and control issues of more direct clinical relevance such as the development of vaccines and therapeutics will only be possible if genomic data are accompanied by relevant clinical, immunological, phenotypic, host genomic and epidemiological data, with biological measures from In vitro and in vivo experimental studies incorporated as they arise. The development and maintenance of widely accessible and fl exible genomic databases is therefore key in this regard. Furthermore, if we are to avoid the limitations of past efforts, it is essential that data from across the clinical spectrum be included so that the all too common bias towards symptomatic and/or severe cases is avoided. An ideal database would also include viral genomic and corresponding metadata from animal reservoir and/or vector populations, particularly if our goal is to predict future viral emergence. In addition to traditional sources, these data might be derived from programmes and early warning systems such as the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative ( http://www.gvfi .org/ ), USAID PREDICT ( http://www.vetmed. ucdavis.edu/ohi/predict/index.cfm ) and the WHO/FAO/OIE Global Early Warning and Response System (GLEWS; http://www.glews.net/ ), which focus on identifi cation and control of potentially emergent pathogens through surveillance at the animalhuman interface. This is a tall order in terms of the level of coordination and collaboration required to bring all of these data together-public health practitioners, fi eld epidemiologists, clinicians, veterinarians and researchers would all have to work together. More important, however, is the computational challenge. There is no shortage of good ideas, but many of the analyses involved are very computationally intensive, and this is already a limiting factor. Bioinformatic and computational tools will therefore have to further evolve to handle the amounts of genomic and other metadata generated.",

In addition to providing a complete picture of viral biodiversity against the full span of existing host genomic backgrounds, this will ensure that needs are addressed where the burden of disease is often greatest. It will also reduce the number of surveillance and control 'blind spots' where viruses might take refuge and eventually re-emerge. It is therefore essential that developing countries be fully integrated into the genomic age, through collaboration, technology transfer and in-country capacity building. The availability of open source databases, computational tools and scientifi c literature also goes a long way in this regard.",
