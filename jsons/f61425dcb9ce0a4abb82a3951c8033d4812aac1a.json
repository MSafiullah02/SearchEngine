            "text": "In the present study, I propose a novel fitting method to describe the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China. The fitted data were selected carefully from the non-Hubei part and Hubei Province of China respectively. For the non-Hubei part, the time period of data collection corresponds from the beginning of the policy of isolation to present day. But for Hubei Province, the subjects of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were included from the time of admission to the Huoshenshan Hospital to present day in order to ensure that all or the majority of the confirmed and suspected patients were collected for diagnosis and treatment. The employed basic functions for fitting are the hyperbolic tangent functions tanh\u00f0:\u00de since in these cases the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic. Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV will initially expand rapidly and tend to disappear. Therefore, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical regions will initially increase rapidly and subsequently stabilize to a plateau phase. The selection of the basic functions for fitting is crucial. In the present study, I found that the hyperbolic tangent functions tanh\u00f0:\u00de could satisfy the aforementioned properties. By this novel method, I can obtain two significant results. They base on the conditions that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually. Initially, I can predict the numbers very accurately of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and parts in China, notably, in Wuhan City with the smallest relative error estimated to 0:021%, in Hubei Province with the smallest relative error estimated to 0:012% and in the non-Hubei part of China with the smallest relative error of \u00c0 0.195% in the short-term period of infection. In addition, perhaps I can predict the times when the plateau phases will occur respectively in different regions in the long-term period of infection. Generally for the non-Hubei part of China, the plateau phase of the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV will be expected this March or at the end of this February. In the non-Hubei region of China it is expected that the epidemic will cease on the 30th of March 2020 and following this date no new confirmed patient will be expected. The predictions of the time of Inflection Points and maximum NACP for some important regions may be also obtained. A specific plan for the prevention measures of the 2019-nCoV outbreak must be implemented. This will involve the present returning to work and resuming production in China. Based on the presented results, I suggest that the rigorous isolation policy by the government should be executed regularly during daily life and work duties. Moreover, as many as possible the confirmed and suspected cases should be collected to diagnose or treat.",

            "text": "In December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown reasons emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and one of the largest cities in the central part of China. Although the majority of them were cured, they led to respiratory failures and a few patient fatalities. This outbreak of pneumonia attracted significant attention in the world. The causative agent identified by the Chinese authorities was designated 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Heath Organization (WHO) on January 10 2020. On January 20 2020, the Chinese government classified the novel 2019-nCoV as a class A agent. A series of non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented, namely, isolation of symptomatic persons, strict restriction of travel in Hubei province and shutdown of the public transport in various cities. Although the number of the accumulative confirmed patients (NACP) in the non-Hubei Chinese regions have decreased continually for 7 days, the effectiveness and efficiency of these interventions is questionable. In addition, when the viral infection reaches its plateau phases several factors are affected including financial costs and work abstention. Therefore, it is very crucial to reduce the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV. So far, there are nearly 20,000 confirmed cases in Wuhan and more than 40,000 confirmed cases in China, whereas several exported cases have been confirmed in other countries including Japan, South Korea, Singapore, USA, Canada, Germany, France, UK and Spain. Mathematical models were employed to investigate the viral outbreak and interesting results were obtained. The mathematical modeling of the 2019 n-CoV outbreak has been previously investigated Tang et al. 2020; Rabajante 2020; Imai et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Fanelli and Piazza 2020; Peng et al. 2020; Toda 2020; Sameni 2020) . The reason of the outbreak has bee reported in previous studies (Chu et al. 2020; Khan et al. 2020a, b) . Its clinical characteristics and laboratory test results were also studied (Qian et al. 2020; World Health Organization 2020) . Its treatment and prognosis were presented in two recent studies (Chen and Du 2020; Chai et al. 2020 ). Its containment strategy was discussed in (Bittihn and Golestanian 2020; Hu et al. 2020) . The prediction of the tendency of 2019-nCoV and notably of the NACP and of the plateau phase is of great importance at present. These goals were achieved by fitting the data of the NACP in these regions. The 2019-nCoV outbreak could not be modeled accurately due to the weak knowledge of the reasons, transmission mechanisms, effect of control policies, treatments strategies and damages. The mechanism of 2019-nCoV infection is very unclear and was studied by several scientists. However, the data contains its much information and can disclose its many natures. Therefore, these data were fitted in order to conduct the outbreak prediction. Two significant features were stated in my novel fitting method as follows:",

For the China regions outside Hubei Province, i.e., the non-Hubei part, the medical conditions are sufficient and the isolation policy is well executed. All the confirmed patients can be collected and receive treatment, and the suspected cases can be collected for diagnosis and further treatment. Therefore, the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is just a general epidemic. For Hubei Province, which includes the Wuhan City, several cabin hospitals and the Leishenshan hospital were employed following initial completeness of the Huoshenshan Hospital. The majority of the confirmed patients can be collected for treatment and most suspected patients can also be collected for diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Therefore, the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City and Hubei Province are considered as a general epidemic and can be treated as such. The data were collected from the non-Hubei part of China from approximately January 20 2020, i.e., from the beginning of the policy of isolation to the present day. The data were collected from Hubei Province and from Wuhan City from February 6 2020, i.e., from the date of the initial establishment of the Huoshenshan hospital, to the present date. The data can be fitted to predict the NACP in the short-term duration and predict the initiation of the plateau phases. \u2022 The selection of the basic functions for the fitting model is crucial for the success of the prediction. Since in both the above cases, the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic, this suggests that it will initially spread rapidly and subsequently exhibit a tendency to disappear. Therefore, the numbers of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical locations will initially increase rapidly and subsequently remain constant when reaching the plateau phase of the viral infection. In the present study, the hyperbolic tangent functions tanh\u00f0:\u00de were used that can satisfy the aforementioned conditions. Therefore, the hyperbolic tangent function tanh\u00f0:\u00de was set as the basic function for fitting. It laid the foundation of the success of the fitting model and further enhanced the prediction success of the 2019-nCoV infection.",

Initially, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical locations in China were predicted very accurately in the short term period of infection. Moreover, the times of the plateau phases were determined in different places in the long-term period of infection. Generally, in the non-Hubei China part, the NACP of 2019-nCoV will tend to constant from approximately February 23 2020 and its maximum infectivity will be theoretically achieved by March 30 2020. Following this date, no additional infected patient will be expected to be diagnosed. Based on the present results, it is suggested that the rigorous isolation policy by the government should be executed continually. The remaining part of this article is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, the novel fitting method of the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China is proposed, and the selection of the data and basic functions is presented. The validation of this novel method was achieved in the data derived from the SARS infection in 2003 in China Mainland and Hongkong, which are presented in Sect. 3.

However, the data of the infectious diseases require a different set of basic functions. Despite fitting of the data, a usual fluctuation may be noted and consequently the tendency-like plateau phase can not be predicted. Therefore, the selection of the basic functions for this fitting is crucial. The infectious diseases are characterized by the numbers of the cumulative confirmed patients. They initially increase rapidly and finally stabilize. At that time period no confirmed patient presents. Following isolation and treatment, the majority of the confirmed patients will recover and a limited number will not survive the infection. At last, the infectious diseases are controlled and eradicated. It is well known that the hyperbolic tangent functions tanh\u00f0:\u00de exhibit two properties: an initial rapid increase and a final phase with constant. Based on these two properties, the functions are rearranged to: 1; tanh\u00f00:1x\u00de; tanh\u00f00:2x\u00de; tanh\u00f00:3x\u00de; . . . or 1; tanh\u00f00:2x\u00de; tanh\u00f00:4x\u00de; tanh\u00f00:6x\u00de; . . . as the basic functions for fitting the data of the NACP in these regions. The accuracy of the fitting by this novel method is excellent since not only it can predict the NACP in these regions in the next day with very small relative errors, but it can also plot the evolution curves of the NACP in the long-run period of infection and perhaps it can be used to estimate the days when the plateau phase comes.",

After this point, the infectious disease will be controlled and the majority of the confirmed patients will recover, whereas a low number of cases will succumb to the disease. The prediction of this point is of great importance to the inhibition of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. In the present study, the prediction of IPs in the 2019-nCoV outbreak in different regions of China is presented (Figs. 11, 12, 13 and Tables 6, 7, 8, 9) . These regions are usually important cities or the main affected regions around Hubei province. It is of great importance to investigate the date of the 2019-nCoV termination. It is very helpful for the prevention of 2019-nCoV outbreak to construct a plan for their daily life, returning to work and resuming production by the government. It can be deduced that the cities in the mainland China outside of Hubei Province should be able to control the outbreak of 2019-nCoV before March 30 2020 and after this date no confirmed patient should be reported. The nearby regions, especially the severe outbreak regions, such as Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui Provinces, the important industrial and financial regions, such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu Provinces and the important international Figs. 11, 12, 13 and Tables 6, 7, 8, 9. Since the medical conditions and curative efficiency are being improved, the NACP of Hubei Province and Wuhan City can not represent the real number of the infected subjects. Thus, the NACP or IP can not be predicted effectively. But in this paper, I have tried to predict the NACPs and IPs for Wuhan City and Hubei Province. The results of NACPs are excellent also and presented in Tables 10, 11 and 12. The results for IPs in these two regions are presented in Fig. 13 \u00f0y \u00c0 z\u00de and Table 6 . Based on the fact that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually, the results of the present study are very significant. Firstly, the numbers of the infected subjects can be predicted very accurately leading to the cumulative number of confirmed patients in different regions of China. Notably, Hubei Province exhibited the smallest relative errors (0:012%), followed by Wuhan City (0:021%). In addition, the non-Hubei Chinese region exhibited larger relative errors (\u00c00:195%) in the short-term period of infection. Moreover, it is possible to predict the time points when the plateau phases are developed in different regions in the long-run period of infection. It was generally shown for the non-Hubei Chinese region that the NACP of the 2019-nCoV infection would tend to reach a constant state of growth from February 23 2020. This evidence is considered very important for the fighting against the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China.",

The data were collected during different time periods of infection occurring in different regions of China to ensure that as many as possible confirmed and suspected cases could be collected for diagnosis or treatment. The hyperbolic tangent functions were used as the basic functions for the fitting method. Two significant results were obtained as follows: Firstly, the NACP could be predicted very accurately in different regions of China, notably in Wuhan City and Hubei Province with very small relative errors. In the non-Hubei region of China larger relative errors were noted in the short-term period of infection. Secondly, the time point at which the plateau phases occur can be predicted in different regions in the long-run period of infection. Generally for the non-Hubei Chinese regions, the plateau phase of 2019-nCoV was noted at approximately March 30 2020 and after this time period no new confirmed patients were identified. The predictions of the time of Inflection Points (IPs) and maximum NACP for certain important regions were also presented. These measures are very important for the prevention of the 2019-nCoV outbreak and for returning to work and resuming production in their daily life and work duties in China.
