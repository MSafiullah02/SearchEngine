Besides, many studies demonstrated that calpain mediates systemic inflammation response in vivo [1].

This point is supported by evidences from several studies focusing on different inflammation cells. In neutrophil, calpain participated in cell migration, adhesion, arrest and oxidative burst [22]. Calpain1 also contributes to IgE-mediated mast cell activation [23]. Calpastatin overexpression can impair post infarct scar healing in mice by compromising reparative immune cell recruitment and activation [24]. And in leukocytes, calpain deficiency reduces angiotensin II-induced inflammation and atherosclerosis [25].",

Although there might be some background levels of expression of the above factors, it is reasonable considering the wide spread of inflammatory cells even in physiology conditions without virus infection. Actually, a variety of inflammation factors whose production or secretion were regulated by calpain have been reported elsewhere including IL5 [26], IL6 [27], IL16 [28] and IL33 [29]. Combined what we have reported in this paper, we could conclude that calpain participates in the regulation of a wide spectrum of inflammation factor production. Researches from PENG's lab [30], [31] in the animal models of sepsis and myocardial infarction have demonstrated respectively that calpain induces myocardial NF-\u03baB activation, which might explain the mechanism that calpain regulates inflammation factors production. Data from another group of our lab also found the role of calpain in regulating NF-\u03baB activity in CVB3-induced myocarditis mice (unpublished data).",

[33] reported that calpain1 regulates MMP2 activity in vascular smooth muscle cells to facilitate age-associated aortic wall fibrosis. So we further observed the effect of calpain on myocardium fibrosis. As we have mentioned here that Smad3/MMP2 pathway was inhibited in the transgenic mouse indicating role of calpain in regulating this classic fibrosis pathway. This was coincided with what PENG's lab have demonstrates that calpain inhibition ameliorates myocardial remodeling after myocardial infarction [31] and myocardial fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy [34]. What's more, we also observed the role of calpain in regulating fibroblasts migration in vitro and found calpain inhibition hinders fibroblast migration in scratch assays. This might explain in a novel angle the mechanisms of calpain in mediating fibrosis.",
