Ultrasound should be performed to confirm the presence of a normal thyroid in its expected location. \u2022 The most common congenital lesion of the larynx is laryngomalacia; most children will outgrow the diagnosis by 24 months of age. \u2022 Cough, rhinorrhea, and diarrhea are more common with viral than with bacterial pharyngitis. \u2022 The diagnostic gold standard for bacterial pharyngitis is a throat culture. \u2022 Diagnosis of PTA is a clinical diagnosis based on history (double worsening, URI symptoms > 5 days prior to new symptoms) and physical exam (hot potato voice, trismus, uvular deviation) \u2022 The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for OSA by history (snoring, daytime symptoms) during well-child checks. Symptoms may include irritability, hyperactivity, daytime sleepiness, and nocturnal enuresis; this is a different constellation of symptoms than in adult patients. \u2022 Ankyloglossia often manifests as discomfort in the mother's nipples. \u2022 Children with cleft palate are at an increased risk of developing Eustachian tube dysfunction resulting in OME and recurrent AOM. \u2022 Eruption cysts present as blue or purple compressible cysts at the site of an erupting deciduous or permanent tooth. These are often self-limiting but may require treatment if they become infected or limit feeding. acknowledge the contributions of Josee Paradis, MD, Paediatric Surgery, London Health Sciences Centre-Victoria Hospital, London, Ontario, Canada, to the first edition of this chapter, many of which have been incorporated into this edition as well.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PEARLS AND PITFALLS"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Syndromic ear anomalies and renal ultrasounds", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Wang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Earl", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Ruder", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Graham", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2001, "venue": "Pediatrics", "volume": "108", "issn": "2", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "A meta-analytic review of the risk factors for acute otitis media", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Uhari", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Mantysaari", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Niemela", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1996, "venue": "Clin Infect Dis", "volume": "22", "issn": "6", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Lieberthal", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Carroll", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Chonmaitree", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Ganiats", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Hoberman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Jackson", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Pediatrics", "volume": "131", "issn": "3", "pages": "964--99", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Dosage error in article text", "authors": [], "year": 2014, "venue": "Erratum Pediatrics", "volume": "133", "issn": "2", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update)", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Rosenfeld", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Shin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Schwartz", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Coggins", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Gagnon", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Hackell", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2016, "venue": "", "volume": "154", "issn": "", "pages": "1--41", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Rosenfeld", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Schwartz", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Pynnonen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Tunkel", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Hussey", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Fichera", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg", "volume": "149", "issn": "1", "pages": "1--35", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Group on Update of Genetics Evaluation Guidelines for the Etiologic Diagnosis of Congenital Hearing Loss; Professional Practice and Guidelines Committee, et al.
