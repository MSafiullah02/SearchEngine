Yet the theoretical concept of drug targeting, first proposed by Paul Ehrlich more than a century ago (his \u201cmagic bullet\u201d theory), has run into numerous practical challenges1. Rapidly after injection, nanocarriers (NCs) inherently accumulate to very high levels in the liver and spleen, part of clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (RES)2. Due to this and other unfavorable factors, NCs are not able to accumulate in many organs of therapeutic interest, most notably the heart and brain, organs whose pathologies cause the majority of the world\u2019s deaths. For example, current nanomedicine formulations achieve at best 1% of the injected dose (%ID) accumulating in the brain3. Affinity moieties such as antibodies have been proposed to increase target accumulation, but they have their own challenges, including unintended effects on host defense (caused for example by IgG multiplexed on NCs), the common necessity of switching affinity moieties between each species, and eventually humanization of affinity ligands. Overcoming these challenges with a technically straightforward and translatable approach for organ targeting of NCs remains the raison d\u2019etre of nanomedicine research.",

RBCs are a particularly attractive vascular carrier4, due to their biocompatibility and clinical safety of transfusion and prior clinical successes using them as drug carriers5,6. The engineering of NC\u2013RBC complexes was inspired by the finding that antibodies or bacteria that naturally or artificially adhere to circulating blood cells such as RBCs are removed by specific organs, though usually the liver7,8. This provided a biological basis for attempts to deliver NCs to other target organs by shuttling the NCs on the surface of the super-carrier cells, including leukocytes and RBCs9,10.",

The RBC-bound NPs injected intravenously (IV) were serendipitously found to accumulate in the lungs, although to a very modest extent. The hypothesized mechanism was that when RBCs squeeze through the lung capillaries, they transfer the NCs to the pulmonary capillary endothelial cells. This prototype RH suggested an interesting mechanism of transfer, but had key liabilities: the NPs had no drug carrying capacity and caused dose-limiting toxicities to RBCs12; and the prototype RH achieved lung delivery of only 3% of the initial dose (ID) of NPs11, quite modest compared to the 30% ID achieved with lung-targeting affinity moieties identified decades ago, such as anti-PECAM antibodies13,14. However, the unique mechanism of delivery suggested a novel path forward for nanomedicine\u2019s organ-targeting challenges.",

Our goals were to move RH toward being a clinically useful platform technology by finding the optimal NC properties for RH, exploring the mechanism of the RH, determining if RH works in large animals and humans, and evaluating the safety of optimized RH. Perhaps more importantly, we sought to extend RH to not just target the lung, but any organ. In particular, we hypothesized that while IV-injected RH-NCs would accumulate in the lungs (the first capillary bed downstream of an IV injection), intra-arterially (IA) injected RH-NCs would accumulate in the immediately downstream organ. Such IA delivery of RH-NCs could treat two of the leading causes of cardiovascular death: heart attack and stroke.

Therefore, we sought to determine if RH could be injected IA, as an IA catheter would already be in place during heart attack and stroke treatment.",

We tested PS-NPs coated with anti-PECAM-monoclonal antibodies, as such targeting epitopes have led to higher lung uptake of this type of NP than any other affinity moiety published to date13,24. RH increased the lung uptake of anti-PECAM PS-NPs 2.6-fold, with concomitant marked reduction of hepatic uptake, resulting in almost an order of magnitude elevation of the lung-to-liver ratio. The combination of affinity moiety plus RH thus increased the lung-to-liver ratio 760-fold over free IgG-PS-NPs (Fig. 2a inset).

As described above, PS-NPs, the model NC used in the prototype RH studies11, causes severe RBC aggregation, on par with that caused by cross-species serum. In sharp contrast, RH-optimized NCs such as nanogels do not cause significant agglutination.",

As with thin smears, uncoated PS-NPs cause RBC agglutination at the maximum degree quantifiable by the assay. By contrast, no RBC agglutination is detectable for RBCs adsorbed with any of the PS-NPs covalently coated with protein (as used in Fig. 2), nanogels (\u00b1 IgG coating), or liposomes.

Clogging of the vasculature with RBCs could impede perfusion to the target organ, cause pro-adhesive activation of endothelium and a pro-thrombotic state, and in the case of clogging in the lung, cause increased pulmonary arterial pressures (PAPs) and subsequent right heart failure. To assay vascular clogging with RBCs, we labeled RBCs with Cr-51, injected them IV, and measured their biodistribution. As a positive control, we intentionally aggregated RBCs by incubating them with the monoclonal antibody Ter119, that binds to the glycophorin-A complex on RBCs, along with a secondary antibody that serves as a cross-linker. As seen in Fig. 4c, the positive control (Ter119) causes IV-injected RBCs to massively accumulate in the lungs. By contrast, RH NCs do not change lung uptake or blood levels at all, compared to the negative control (IV-injected RBCs without NCs).",

These PE model mice were also injected with either saline, free reteplase-NGs, or RH reteplase-NGs. As seen in Fig. 6c, the amount of clot in the lungs (I-125) is the same for mice receiving either saline or free reteplase NGs, but RH reteplase-NGs show 16 times lower levels of I-125 in the lungs. As would happen with clot dissolution, as opposed to dislodgement of clots, the blood levels of I-125 fibrin/fibrinogen were markedly higher in mice that received RH reteplase-NGs. We quantified the fraction of initial PE (clot in the lung) that dissolved over 1 h, and found that saline and free-reteplase had the same low level of clot dissolution (performed by endogenous mechanisms), while RH-reteplase dissolved nearly 100% of the initial PE (Fig. 6d). Thus, these experiments are proof-of-principle that RH can strongly localize therapeutics to the lungs and thereby ameliorate a severe disease model.",

Figure 7b shows that the right side of the brain receives significantly more delivery than the left, and that the distribution within the brain varies in correlation with defined anatomical substructures. To further localize the RH NC delivery, we performed a similar experiment to autoradiography, but injected RH NCs that were labeled with rhodamine and performed immunofluorescent microscopy. Numerous puncta were seen in the brain, again more on the right side of the brain than left (Fig. 7c). Finally, we performed H&E staining of those brain sections, which showed that the right hemisphere of the brain showed no morphological difference than the left, suggesting no major, acute toxicity (Fig. 7d). Therefore, collectively these data show that an IA injection can safely deliver NCs to the brain at levels markedly above prior technologies.",

We provided the first experimental support for this mechanism by showing via histological analysis that RH NCs are indeed found inside the capillary endothelial cells in the lungs. Surprisingly, we also found that in pathological tissue, RH also delivers NCs to intravascular leukocytes that reside in the capillaries. Consistent with this finding, in vitro macrophages in microfluidics arrested flowing RBCs and removed NCs coating them. It is likely that multiple types of intravascular leukocyte take up RH NCs, as eliminating only intravascular macrophages in healthy mice did not affect total lung uptake of RH NCs (Supplementary Figure 2). The lack of effect of eliminating macrophages could mean that other cell types take up RH NCs in the macrophages\u2019 absence, or simply that macrophages play a larger role in RH NC uptake in pathological lung tissue than in healthy lungs, consistent with our histology (Fig. 3a vs. Fig. 3b). In the lung pathology, RH is best suited for ARDS, both endothelial cells and local leukocytes are prominent targets for the treatment, so targeting both can have major advantages. Likewise, in the two acute illnesses which cause the most death and disability in the developed world, stroke and heart attack, the endothelium and homing leukocytes play a prominent role in pathology and thus serve as important drug targets35\u201337.",

For example, viruses or other pathogens may adsorb onto RBCs, as we observed with AAV, and then get taken up by the next organ to which they are presented. Notably, the NCs used here are in the same size range as most viruses (e.g., AAV is 25 nm and HIV 120 nm). Indeed, pathogens have been intentionally attached onto RBCs using specific antibodies, and these pathogens are then transferred to the liver8. The lung, as the first capillary bed after entry of a NC or pathogen into a vein, may have similarly evolved the function of taking up RBC-adsorbed pathogens as a defense mechanism to protect other downstream organs. Indeed, even though IA RH provides unprecedented delivery to the immediately downstream organ, the lung still gets a disproportionate amount of RH NCs after IA injection (Supplementary Figure 1). Such data intriguingly suggest that perhaps the lung has evolved to be especially adept at receiving RH pathogens and NCs. These data also imply that IA RH should focus on drugs that do not have pulmonary toxicity. Future studies can elucidate the role of RBC adsorption and RH in pathogen uptake into organs.",

RH\u2019s nano-micro-macro synergy provides tremendous target-organ specificity by focusing on delivery of NCs on the \u201cfirst-pass\u201d of the injectate through an organ. Such a system is now very practical for the most common acute, severe diseases. In severe heart attacks and embolic strokes, standard of care is to insert an IA catheter for removal of the flow blockage, thereby easily allowing IA injection of RH NCs. For the most common severe acute lung disease, ARDS, which accounts for 10% of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, only an IV catheter is needed, which all such patients have in place. That means RH is well poised to serve as the delivery modality for the three most important acute, severe illnesses. For these acute applications, there will likely not be time to cross-match the blood, so RH will utilize universal donor blood (O-negative), which is currently used for emergent bleeding standardly in all hospitals. Notably, such intravascular catheters are not practical for most chronic, outpatient-treated diseases, and thus RH development should focus on acute, critical illnesses. However, another major application, which also will utilize directing RH into macro-scale catheters, is delivery into transplanted organs to deliver ischemia-reperfusion-injury drugs. Thus, RH has the potential to provide a drug delivery platform for multiple common diseases that currently lack effective therapies.",
