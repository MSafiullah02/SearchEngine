This novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a national outbreak of severe pneumonia in China, and rapidly spread around the world. Spain is one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 210.000 cases (218.011) and 25.428 deaths confirmed, May 7th 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused the 2003 and 2012 epidemics, respectively. It has been shown that SARS-CoV targets the Central Nervous System (CNS) causing neurological manifestations. Thus it could be expected that COVID-19 follows the same trend as these virus are almost taxonomically identical.",

However, other routes should be considered such as cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone in proximity to the olfactory bulb (Wu et al., 2020) . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 isolation from Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) suggests that virus can directly invade the nervous system and cause nerve damage Recent papers have described acute CNS-associated symptoms in patients affected with SARS-CoV-2, specially neurological ones such as loss of smell and taste, strokes, delirium, viral encephalitis, toxic encephalopathy (Moriguchi et al., 2020) and acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy (Poyiadji et al., 2020) . From a psychiatric point of view, studies are focused on the influence of the coronavirus pandemic on health workers\u00b4 mental health, grief and emotional effects on general population. Unfortunately, less attention has been paid on the involvement of this virus in the development of new onset psychotic episodes (Vald\u00e9s-Florido et al., 2020) .",
