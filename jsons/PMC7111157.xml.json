The full-length N gene of the SARS coronavirus (Singapore isolate) was PCR-amplified from a genomic construct of clone NC_004718, and cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The full-length N gene was subjected to DNA sequencing, and the inserts were verified against the corresponding region of the SARS coronavirus complete genome NC_004718. The full-length N gene was excised from the pCR-XL-TOPO-N construct using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and ClaI, and ligated into the pGADT7 vector to generate an N-terminal in-frame fusion with the GAL4 activation domain (AD). To clone N in fusion with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, pGADT7-N was digested with NcoI and PstI, and the excised fragment was ligated into the pAS2 vector which was linearized with the same pair of restriction enzymes. HA tagged N was cloned into pSGI by digesting pGADT7-N with BglII and ligating into pSGI digested with the same enzyme. Myc-tagged N was produced by ligating the BamHI and ApaI fragment from pCR-XL-TOPO-N into pcDNA 3.1 vector digested with the same enzymes. All DNA manipulations were performed as described by Sambrook et al. [8]. All deletion constructs were generated by subcloning the full-length N gene as summarized in Table 1. All constructs were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing.",

The GAL4-based two-hybrid system, kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Elledge [6], contain pAS2 (DNA binding domain vector) and pACT2 (activation domain vector), together with the yeast reporter strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 (Table 1) were employed. The host strain containing pAS2-SNF1 and pACT2-SNF4 was used as a positive control [9]. The AH109 host contains integrated copies of both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of GAL4 binding sites. The AH109 yeast strain was transformed with the appropriate plasmids using the lithium acetate procedure, and grown on SD plates in the absence of Trp and Leu (SDTrp\u2212 and SDLeu\u2212, respectively). Protein interaction was tested on SD plates without Leu, Trp, and His (SDLeu\u2212Trp\u2212His\u2212). After incubation 30 \u00b0C for 3 days, individual colonies were streaked out and tested for liquid and filter-lift \u03b2-galactosidase activity, by 50 mM oft 3-amino-1,2,3-triazole (3AT) assay, and by the diploid His assay. The filter \u03b2-galactosidase assay, a parameter directly reflecting the strength of protein\u2013protein interactions, was performed by streaking doubly transformed yeast colonies onto filter paper and allowing them to grow for 2 days on selection medium. Yeast cells were permeabilized by freezing yeast-impregnated filters in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature. The filter was placed over a second filter that was pre-soaked in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) and 0.27% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Filters were left for 48 h to develop a blue color which indicated a positive protein-protein interaction. The liquid \u03b2-galactosidase activity was determined using the substrate CPRG as described previously [10], [11]. Relative enzymatic activity was determined for five independent transformants. Data for quantitative assays were collected for yeast cell number and are means \u00b1 SEM of triplicate assays. Appropriate positive and negative controls, and buffer blanks were used. The AH109 host strain containing pAS2-SNF1 and pACT2-SNF4 was used as a positive control [9].",

In order to confirm the reading frame and expression of the N protein, it was expressed in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte-based, coupled transcription\u2013translation system (Promega) and immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody (data not shown). S. cerevisiae AH109 (MATa trp1-901 his3 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 ade2 gal4 gal80URA3::GAL-lacZ LYS2::GAL-HIS3) cells were transformed with single plasmids, or cotransformed with the GAL4 BD- and AD-vectors containing SARS-CoV N. The AH109 host strain containing pAS2-SNF1 and pACT2-SNF4 was used as positive controls [9]. AH109 contains integrated copies of both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of GAL4-binding sites. The results of the two-hybrid assay are shown in Fig. 1\n. Single transformants used in this assay were AH109 yeast cells containing BD-N, and cells containing AD-N. Yeast host cells containing only BD- and only AD-vectors, were also used as negative controls (Fig. 1). All these transformants grew on the YPD non-selective media. The untransformed host cells were also plated as negative controls. Single transformants containing the BD-vector alone or as a fusion with N showed growth on the synthetic dextrose Trp\u2212 plate (SDTrp\u2212). Correspondingly, single transformants containing the AD-vector alone or as a fusion with N showed growth on the synthetic dextrose Leu\u2212 plate (SDLeu\u2212). The cotransformants were similarly plated on YPD and synthetic dextrose medium lacking Trp or Leu or both, and the resultant colonies were subsequently plated on His\u2212 medium (SDTrp\u2212Leu\u2212His\u2212) to test for His prototrophy. Growth of the cotransformants, containing the BD-N and AD-N constructs, in both SDTrp\u2212 and SDLeu\u2212 plates simply showed that both plasmids were present in the transformed cells. Growth of these clones on the SDTrp\u2212Leu\u2212His\u2212 media showed that the transcription of the HIS3 gene was switched on by the reconstitution of the GAL4 transactivator due to a specific N\u2013N interaction. Colonies were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters and a \u03b2-galactosidase filter assay was performed [12], [13], [14]. The cotransformants containing both the BD-N and AD-N constructs together with all positive and negative controls were tested by this assay. Results obtained from the \u03b2-galactosidase filter assay were in agreement with the results obtained from the SDHis\u2212 growth experiments.",

Lane 2 in Fig. 3\nshows a cotransfected sample immunoprecipitated using anti-myc antibody.

These results clearly demonstrate that the N protein is capable of homodimerization in a mammalian cellular environment. In order to form the capsid of SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein has to oligomerize. Hence our data provide a functional verification to earlier predictions regarding the N protein of the SARS virus.

However, the AD 1-830, AD 1-630, and AD 1-310, when cotransformed with their corresponding full-length N construct (BD-N), showed no reporter gene activation. However, the strength of interaction between 630-1260 and BD-N was found to be lower than that of full-length N\u2013N or AD N 310-1260 and full length N interaction. Hence, we mapped the interaction domain for the N protein dimerization to reside in C terminal one-third amino acids. Upon investigation of the predicted secondary structure model for N, we found this region to be helix-rich and contained the putative nuclear localization signal.",

            "text": "Self-association of the nucleocapsid protein has been observed in many viruses. This process leads to the formation of a viral capsid which protects the genome from extracellular agents. In this report, we have used two independent assays to establish a direct interaction between the nucleocapsid molecules. This dimerization process is likely to lead to multimerization of the N protein and to subsequent capsid assembly. While the functional relevance of this interaction in an in vivo context is unknown, our report nonetheless clearly proves a direct physical interaction between the SARS N protein molecules. Moreover, the strong capability to self-associate was demonstrated by the N\u2013N cotransformed yeast cells which exhibited the ability to grow at 50 mM concentration of 3AT in the yeast two-hybrid assay. However, the exact mechanism of interaction is not known. In a wide range of viruses disulfide bond mediated self-association of nucleocapsid has been observed [17], [18], [19], [20], but the N protein of SARS is unable to do so since it does not have any cysteine as observed from its amino acid composition. Observations have been gathered from N proteins of other RNA virus genomes (e.g., equine arthritis virus and simian hemorrhagic fever virus). The disulfide bond in the nucleocapsid protein has been proposed to enhance the stability of virions: e.g., hepatitis B virus [18] and human papilloma virus [19]. Interestingly, N proteins of other corona viruses contain cysteine residues, e.g., MHV N has 2 cysteine residues. Although it is not known whether cysteine plays a role in self-association of nucleocapsid in other corona viruses, the complete absence of cysteine residues in the N protein of SARS implies that it is unique among other corona viruses. It is quite possible that the SARS virus may have adopted an alternative conformational strategy to circumvent the problem of missing cysteine. In an in silico model for secondary predictions, both N proteins of MHV and SARS show a hydrophilic, helix rich C-terminal. This distinct secondary structure may be responsible for tight intramolecular self-association; however, the exact mechanism and forces driving the described self-association of the nucleocapsid proteins need further investigation. Further, since the N protein of SARS has been predicted to play other regulatory functions [21] besides capsid assembly, dimerization could be an activating switch for regulation of protein function. Moreover, in MHV, the RNA binding domain has been found to reside in similar locations between amino acids 163\u2013229 [20], which includes the C-terminal helix-rich region. We have identified the dimerization domain of the N protein of SARS to be localized to the C-terminal helix rich region thus suggesting a similar strategy by the SARS virus for nucleocapsid formation.",
