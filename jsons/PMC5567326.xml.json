Although the clinical manifestations of A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal H1N1 infections were similar2, many severe and fatal cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 occurred not only in patients with underlying diseases but also in healthy children and young adults3, 4. Some reports have shown that bronchial asthma was one of the most common underlying conditions in patients hospitalized with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection5, 6. Additionally, it has been reported that children with asthma showed increased susceptibility to A(H1N1)pdm09 viral infection7, and the incidence of A(H1N1)pdm09 viral infection was significantly higher in children with asthma than in children without asthma7.",

However, severe respiratory issues, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), have been reported in children and young adults with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection5, 8\u201310. Bronchial asthma increases the risk of hospital and intensive care admission in infants and children3\u20136, 10\u201314. We previously reported that A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, but not seasonal H1N1 infection, induces severe pulmonary inflammation in a mouse model of asthma 7 days after infection14, 15. However, we observed that the duration of the latent period for A(H1N1)pdm09 infection is shorter than 7 days, and patients present earlier progression of pulmonary disease and systemic conditions after infection. Since exacerbation was frequently observed in asthmatic patients after viral infection, we suspect that a cytokine storm, including inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6 and tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), anti-viral cytokines (interferon [IFN]-\u03b3), and helper T (Th) 2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), may occur in the lung following A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. However, little is known about the early host response against A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in patients with underlying bronchial asthma.",

The pulmonary cytokine storm at 3 days post-infection in asthma/A(H1N1)pdm09 mice may mirror the rapid exacerbation observed in asthmatic patients13. In contrast, the delayed peak in IL-10 levels and insufficient surge of IFN-\u03b3 levels in A(H1N1)pdm09 mice at 7 days post-infection could lead to ineffective exclusion of the viruses. The early potent inflammation associated with high viral loads in the lungs of asthmatic/A(H1N1)pdm09 mice may corroborate the rapid progression of asthmatic patients during outbreaks of pandemic virus infection. Because the dynamics of IL-1\u03b2 was different from those of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels, IL-1\u03b2 may play other roles after influenza virus infection. In addition, the IL-13 levels were increased in only the asthma/A(H1N1)pdm09 group after the infection. IL-13 may be involved in pathophysiology of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in asthmatic children. Although IL-2, IL-4, and IL-17A may be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and influenza infection, they were undetectable in the BAL fluid from mice in this study.

After A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, the viral loads in BAL fluid from asthmatic mice were higher than those from control mice, which was not typically observed after seasonal infection (Fig. 3). Immunostaining of the virus showed many InfA-NP-positive cells in the lungs of asthmatic/A(H1N1)pdm09 and control/A(H1N1)pdm09 mice since early phase after viral infection, but not in the lungs of mice from seasonal H1N1 groups, as shown in Fig. 5. Previous reports demonstrated that A(H1N1)pdm09 viral proteins were detected in damaged type II pneumocytes, epithelial cells, and infiltrated macrophages in the lung by immunohistochemistry16\u201318. In addition, at autopsy after A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, acute diffuse alveolar damage was observed19. Avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to SA\u03b12-3 Gal, which is expressed on distal bronchioles and type II pneumocytes in the lower respiratory tract19. In contrast, seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses bind to SA\u03b12-6 Gal, which is expressed on epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. A(H1N1)pdm09 virus binds to both SA\u03b12-6 Gal and SA\u03b12-3Gal19, 20. Predominant replication of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the lower respiratory tract, compared with that of seasonal influenza virus, could explain the distinct viral loads shown in Fig. 3. These findings suggested that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus may induce severe pneumonia in asthmatic patients, which is much less likely in seasonal influenza-infected asthmatic patients or non-asthmatic patients. We concluded that severe pulmonary complications are caused not only by the characteristics of the infecting viruses but also by factors in the host defence of asthmatic children during A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.",

The reasons for this discrepancy may be the lower affinity for the virus receptors present in the lower respiratory tract or some yet unknown properties of the polyclonal antibodies and/or viral strains used, although the reason remains unclear. Further research should be directed toward immunohistochemical studies of the upper respiratory tract along with lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness.",
