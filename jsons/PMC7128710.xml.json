Knowledge about illness in travellers contributes to the understanding of disease epidemiology in our interconnected world. In addition to their own ill health, travellers serve as sentinels of infectious diseases; moreover, they can also transmit and disseminate infections.2, 3, 4 Travellers have shown these important roles in emerging infections such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), dengue virus infection, chikungunya infection, and currently Ebola virus disease, and also in antibiotic resistance.3, 4, 5, 6 The GeoSentinel Surveillance Network, a collaboration between the International Society of Travel Medicine and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has described significant disease epidemiology in travellers, and has also identified emerging infections through travellers such as sarcocystis on Tioman Island and the ongoing dengue outbreak in Luanda, Angola, in 2013.7, 8, 9, 10\n",

The weakness, however, is that they are mainly descriptive and variations in disease patterns over the years might be attributed to evolving travel patterns including changes in destinations and itineraries. Thus, shifts in disease trends should be interpreted with caution because they might simply be related to changing exposure. Moreover, some diseases (eg, dengue fever) also occur in countries not reporting to GeoSentinel, simply because they are not tourist destinations.",

Further, the authors show the association between dengue virus and certain destinations and countries of origin, highlighting the popular destinations for various nationalities. Previous analysis of dengue from the GeoSentinel Network detected an increasing trend in travellers before national outbreak trends came to public recognition.11 The detailed information provided by the authors might help national health authorities to formulate optimum advice for their travellers.",

Nevertheless, this report on European travellers provides valuable information: an association of illness when travelling to sub-Saharan Africa and Asia; the potential of acquiring endemic infections even when travelling to other parts of Europe; an increased reporting of some vector-borne infections over time; the role of travellers as sentinels and disseminators of infections; and finally, the benefits of pre-travel health preparation.
