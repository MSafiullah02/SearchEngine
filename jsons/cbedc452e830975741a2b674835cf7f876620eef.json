At the DVT 57 diagnosis, anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 100 U/Kg twice daily 58 was started and patient 1 died 3 days later due to pulmonary embolism.Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may develop dyspnea and hypoxemia and often need HcPAP 61 support. Albeit a good knowledge has been gained on the correlation between DVT and acute 62 respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in which the coagulation cascade is activated in response to 63 several \"inflammatory storm\", less clear information has been provided between SARS-CoV-2 and 64 DVT 2,3 . In a case-control study on Whuan patients it was observed that on admission antithrombin 65 (AT) and PT values were found to be significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients than in controls,66 whereas the values of D-dimer (10.36 vs. 0.26 ng/L; p < 0.001) and fibrinogen (5.02 vs. 2.90 g/L; p 67 < 0.001) were higher and were associated with poor prognosis as in our series. No other differences 68 could be observed in values of aPTT and PT between the two groups (p > 0.05) 4 . Moreover, Tang et 69 al have suggested that early application of LMWH prophylaxis improves outcome only in selected 70 patients (severe SARS-CoV-2 infection) that meet sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria or 71 with markedly elevated D-dimer in which the dysfunction of endothelial cells with thrombin 72 generation, fibrinolysis shutdown and increased blood viscosity secondary to hypoxia 5 are known. 73 However, should be considered that, in our clinical series, long-term bed rest, severe dehydration 74 secondary to fever, tachypnea and sometimes diarrhea, and the compressive action on the axillary 75 veins by the hood straps of the HcPAP also increase the risk of DVT. The principal limitation of 76 this report included small number and single-center study. Our findings should be confirmed in an 77 adequately powered clinical study.",
