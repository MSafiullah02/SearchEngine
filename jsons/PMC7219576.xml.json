The results show that, by using the maximum Spread Factor (SF) and a bandwidth of 125 kHz in the 868 MHz band, the signal can reach the gateway from a 15 km distance on the ground and 30 km on water, with increments of the Packet Drop Rate (PDR) proportional to the distance. The authors of [16] have performed a similar analysis in a medium-density urban area, noting in this case, that the maximum range under the same conditions described in [15] is only 5.8 km, mainly due to the presence of obstacles in the line-of-sight. Moheddine et al. in [17] proposed the concept of flying gateways for enabling communication between IoT and UAV networks. Though their work used Raspberry Pi boards, they expected to improve the performance of the network using LoRa devices.",

The authors report that at a distance of 1.2 km from the gateway the PDR is already between 60% and 90%. The authors conclude that the presence of line-of-sight is particularly important and that LoRa is not suited for indoor environments if long-range and low PDR is required. The importance of line-of-sight is also outlined by Iova et al. [19]. In this case, the experiments were conducted in a forest environment in the presence of numerous trees between the transmitter and the receiver. In the experiment, the transmitter was moved further and further away from the receiver and at around 90\u2013100 m the signal was completely lost. The authors conclude that vegetation has a huge impact on LoRa signal propagation, in fact dropping the maximum achievable range by an order of magnitude. The use of the chirp spread spectrum, a variation of Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), makes the LoRa modulation very resilient to noise. This assumption is verified by Angrisani et al. [20]. In the experiment, different levels of white Gaussian noise are applied to the signal starting with a minimum signal-to-noise ratio of \u221210 dBm. As expected, the use of a smaller bandwidth and, more significantly, the use of a higher SF improves the performance of the modulation. The coding rate, on the other hand, has a less significant impact on the performance in noisy environments.",

Each end device has an associated class that models the behavior of a LoRa chip and tracks its state (standby, sleep, transmission or reception). The only difference is in the fact that their proposed scheme defines 8 parallel reception paths, each one of them able to lock on an incoming packet on a given frequency. Their results show considerable improvement using the developed LoRa module. Van den Abeele et al. in [22] proposed a model similar to the one previously described. The main difference resides in the way in which inter-device interference is computed. In this case, instead of using a signal-to-interference matrix, the authors performed a series of complex MATLAB baseband simulations to measure the Bit Error Rate (BER) of a set of LoRa configurations over a white Gaussian noise channel. The BER points are then used to determine the BER curve that is then used to decide if a packet is lost for interference or not.",

The swarm has also the additional requirement of keeping the connectivity to a ground base station. Two scenarios are studied by the authors: one in which the connectivity to the base station is permanent and one in which some disconnections are allowed for the purpose of extending the exploration. Di Felice et al. [24] propose a distributed approach similar to [23], but based on VSFs. The UAV mesh network described in the paper is used to give coverage to a set of partitioned ground nodes. The least visited cell in the visibility zone is then selected for exploration and an attractive spring force is computed between the UAV and the center of the cell. Chandrashekar et al. [25] study the problem of determining the minimum number of UAVs necessary to provide full coverage to clusters of isolated ground nodes and at the same time maintain connectivity between UAVs. The position of the UAV that covers this subset of clusters (supercluster) is determined by means of a convex minimization problem. The UAV to send to the new computed location is chosen by using a metric that minimizes the total travel distance of UAVs. Caillouet et al. [26] tackle the more challenging problem of optimally positioning the minimum number of UAVs, taken from the set of all available UAVs, in order to cover a set of targets on the ground, while maintaining the connectivity of the aerial mesh to a ground base station. An evaluation of the model performed by the authors proves that the algorithm always finds an optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time (1000 s). The authors also state that the impact of the connectivity constraint more than doubles, in some circumstances, the number of deployed UAVs.",

However, one of the main requirements of an LPWAN is its ability to scale to hundreds or even thousands of devices. Early attempts to assessing the scalability of LoRaWAN were performed by resorting to mathematical models. Mikhaylov et al. [31] assessed the scalability of a LoRa network in the presence of a single gateway. The authors modeled the LoRaWAN MAC as pure ALOHA and concluded that LoRaWAN can potentially scale to millions of devices in case of end devices generating only intermittent uplink traffic, but most of the devices need to be positioned very close to the gateway. The authors of [22] provided analysis for LoRaWAN. They performed simulation in ns-3 and analyzed the scalability and reliability of such networks. The authors of [32] performed measurements for received signal strength (RSS) for a LoRa network for indoor, suburban and urban environments. They concluded that for vertical transmitting antennas, the radiation pattern of UAV results in stronger RSS levels at the LoRa network.",

            "text": "The integration of UAVs and LPWAN protocols in disaster scenarios may offer a new cost-effective and energy-efficient way of tackling many problems arising during the operations of the rescuers. For instance, consider a forest in which a wildfire has been detected. Wildfires generally represent a worldwide problem, but America and Europe are the two continents where the incidence of forest fires is higher. The costs, in terms of economic losses and human deaths, are also considerable [13]. Wildfires typically affect rural or suburban areas where the network coverage of traditional communication networks (e.g., cellular networks) is scarce, intermittent or completely lacking. This situation is worsened by the huge propagation loss introduced by foliage and trees in the signal propagation path. In this situation UAVs can be used to establish a mesh network acting as a relay between the Base Station (BS) installed in the command post, the place where operations are managed, and the sensors carried by firemen, therefore providing more precise situational awareness to the rescuers. The mobility of the firefighters represents another huge challenge since the UAVs mesh network needs to adjust its position while maintaining the connectivity to the BS and to firemen on the ground. Unfortunately, the related literature on such works is still scarce, leaving many issues open to further investigation. In this work, our objective is to design and evaluate a UAV mesh network system, called UAV-enabled LoRa network. In this regard, the distinguishing aspects of our work and a brief comparison with the state-of-the-art solutions are given in Table 1. The main contribution of this work can be summarized as follows:A novel UAV-enabled LoRa network architecture is proposed for the disaster management network. The proposed solution is easy to deploy and does not incur much cost for the network.A decentralized topology control algorithm for the UAVs has been provided. The proposed topology control algorithm allows UAVs to preserve connectivity with the BS, despite the mobility of the Ground Nodes (GNs).Exhaustive performance evaluation of the UAV-enabled LoRa network has been performed in ns-3. The selected QoS metrics such as average packet reception rate, average buffered packets, and total delay have been used to assess the performance of the network.",

Like many other LPWAN technologies, LoRa uses unlicensed sub-GHz bands, therefore taking advantage of the good propagation properties of the spectrum. Since the LoRa modulation is proprietary, no official comprehensive description of the modulation exists as of today, but some attempts to reverse engineer the protocol have been made.

An altitude optimization procedure may be introduced seamlessly on top of the system at a later time. Moreover, all UAVs can move with constant speed in any direction. Drones are complex systems that require complex controllers to manage speed, acceleration, stability and heading along the six-axis. This work focuses on the performance of the networks and on the ability of the UAVs mobility algorithm to improve the coverage of GNs. UAVs also have access to the received power of neighboring UAVs and GNs or can estimate it based on their position. Routing messages can be used to collect the received power, which is necessary to determine the link budget of the links with neighboring UAVs. The received power of GNs can be collected when an uplink message is received. Eventually, the received power can be estimated by resorting to propagation models and the positions of the nodes.",

In its most simple form, the algorithm runs at fixed regular intervals \u0394T. At each time step, each UAV generates a set of virtual springs, having one end attached to the UAV that generated them and the other end attached to either a GN (AtG springs) or another UAV (AtA springs).

Choosing link budget measurements instead of physical distances is more meaningful for a communication system. The link budget gives a more direct indication of the quality of the link, e.g., LBreq based on application-specific QoS requirements. The total force Ftoti applied to UAV i is given by\n(2)Ftoti=\u2211j=0NFij\nwhere N is the number of springs originating from i.

However, for different UAV in the system, Nneighsmax can be approximated with the total number of UAVs currently operating in the system. The above equation allows scaling the magnitude of the attractive/repulsive AtA forces based on the relative number of neighboring UAVs. In this way, a UAV with few neighbors will have a higher tendency to stick to the formation, while a UAV with many neighbors will exhibit the opposite behavior.

This mechanism has the purpose of keeping the UAV in a stable position for some time and avoid further disconnections.

The above expression assigns a more conservative behavior to drones that are closer to the BS and, therefore, the ones that are more likely to cause the disconnection of a big part of the network. On the contrary, peripheral UAVs can move more freely, since it is less likely that their disconnection causes the partition of other parts of the network. The pause parameter is ignored only in one circumstance, that is when the load parameter is zero. This parameter measures the number of relayed packets during a time window of fixed length tload and it can, therefore, be used to select those UAVs that have been inactive for some time.

It is possible that a group of UAVs, covering almost the same set of GNs, gets separated from the rest of the swarm.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed solution, we compare our approach with that of [24]. In the figure, our proposed approach is shown as a solid line, whereas, the approach of [24] is illustrated as a dashed line. In general, it can be seen that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional approach of [24] in terms of improved AE-PRR. In addition to this, it can be noticed that the number of teams influences the range of Kp values that gives the best results in terms of AE-PRR. As an example, with only 4 teams and 12 UAVs, the best results are obtained with Kp in the range [20, 30], while with 5 teams and 12 UAVs the best range becomes [30, 40]. In general, we can observe that a bigger number of GNs requires bigger Kp values. Another immediate and obvious consequence of adding more GNs is the decrease of the maximum achievable AE-PRR, which passes from around 0.9 with one team to almost 0.65 with five teams. Furthermore, one can observe that the difference between the packet reception rate of the proposed solution and that of [24] grows for a larger number of UAVs in the network. This is one of the most critical aspects of the proposed solution is that the high packet loss might be too penalizing for a critical application.

The figure shows the AE-PRR of two simulation scenarios: one having 3 teams of 10 GNs and the other having 3 teams of 40 GNs. Compared with the results reported in Figure 5, in the scenario with only 10 GNs per team, the system behaves better with a lower Kp (range [5, 10]). On the contrary, in the scenario with 40 GNs per team, the system performs better with a higher Kp (range [45, 50]). This shows that a higher density of GNs moving in the same area requires bigger values of Kp to obtain the best AE-PRR results.",

Specifically, it is the sum of the delay experienced in the LoRaWAN network segment and in the WiFi network segment while it also includes the delay caused by buffered packets. In this regard, a plot is shown in Figure 7 for three teams of GNs. The ATD decreases with the number of UAVs and with bigger values of Kp. To understand this behavior, it is necessary to remember that the ATD is computed only on packets that are successfully received by the BS and it takes into account also the time that a packet eventually spends in the buffer. Therefore, in scenarios with few UAVs, the mesh is more subject to disconnections and the bigger number of buffered packets contributes in large part to the big delay.",

This is confirmed by the decreasing trend of the average percentage of buffered packets shown in Figure 8, which is an indication of the probability of disconnections in the mesh. Kp must, therefore, be chosen as a compromise between the desired coverage and delay. The analysis of the other QoS metrics produces some minor observations. In conclusion, Kp proved to be an important parameter that greatly influences the performance of the system. It has, therefore, to be chosen properly depending on the number of UAVs, the number of teams and the number of GNs per team. Configuring Kp might be complex in a real system, due to the numerous variables that must be taken into account. A future study of a Kp optimization routine is, therefore, necessary to simplify the configuration process.",

The main objective of the system is to extend the network coverage offered by a BS to a set of mobile GNs using relaying gateways installed on UAVs. This objective is achieved thanks to a double-layer network that consists of a LoRaWAN segment for the communication between the GNs and the gateways and a WiFi ad hoc network for all the communications between the gateways and the BS. The core of the system is the UAV-enabled LoRa network mobility algorithm, specifically designed to adapt as much as possible to the ever-changing position of the GNs. It is shown that the activation of all the UAV-enabled LoRa network algorithms (VSF + CRM + MP) allows us to obtain an AE-PRR above 0.9 in a representative scenario with three teams of GNs and 12 UAVs. An acceptable AE-PRR, between 0.8 and 0.9, is obtained with 8 or 10 UAVs. We anticipate that our work would be helpful in the practical realization of such disaster management networks.",

The developed algorithm may need to be modified to limit as much as possible unnecessary movements and transmissions. A future iteration of the system might also consider the usage of fixed-wings drones to increase the maximum air-time. Moreover, the impact of outdated channel estimation can also be investigated for practical systems. These challenging tasks are left for future studies.",
