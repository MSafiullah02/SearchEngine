For example, researchers have found that patients colonized with Candida sp. developed significantly more grade II to IV acute GvHD and GI GvHD than noncolonized patients (7). We previously found both the mouth and gut to be dominated by Candida albicans and Candida glabrata prior to mucormycosis during induction remission chemotherapy (8). Similarly, patients with a baseline microbiome community dominated by Candida and aciduric bacteria were more likely to develop oral candidiasis during antineoplastic treatment (9). Recently, variation in mycobiome composition was linked to treatment-related toxicities after autologous HSCT for multiple myeloma (10). Specifically, the composition of the baseline oral mycobiome was associated with vomiting as well as culture-negative neutropenic fever, while the fungal community on day 7 posttransplantion was associated with the incidence and severity of mucositis.",

            "text": "Patients with hematologic malignancy receive multiple types of drugs that may impact both fungal and bacterial communities. There is some evidence that the oral and intestinal bacterial microbiota in humans may be altered by cytotoxic chemotherapy (11), although the effects on the fungal microbiota are less clear. It has been previously shown that cytotoxic and cisplatin compounds have direct anti-Candida activity and also inhibit filamentation/conidation (12). More recently, investigators demonstrated that the oral microbiome is disrupted by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and doxorubicin chemotherapy, but they did not observe major changes in the composition of the mycobiome (13). Moreover, mice receiving both 5-fluorouracil and C. albicans had a loss of bacterial diversity and showed endogenous overgrowth of organisms such as Enterococcus and Stenotrophomonas in the oral mucosa (14). In addition to chemotherapy, antimicrobial therapy, a very common practice in this patient population, impacts mycobiome composition. For example, it was observed that antibiotics with antianaerobic activity affected the oral fungal community composition posttransplantion in multiple myeloma patients (10). Also, bacteremia with fluconazole-resistant Candida has been associated with exposure to several different antimicrobials, including carbapenems, clindamycin, and colistin (15). It has long been known that some antibacterial agents promote fungal growth via indirect effects (16), many of which promote Candida colonization (17, 18).",

Given the key role of Candida in the health of the oropharynx and because oral microaspiration is the most common pathological mechanism of bacterial pneumonia, the most severe infection during RIC in this patient population, we focused on the oral mycobiome and its connectivity with the oral bacteriome (20, 21).",

At the genus level, the most abundant genus observed across all time points was Malassezia, followed by Candida, Saccharomyces, Fusarium, and Cladosporium. This is very similar to the core set of oral mycobiome taxa previously identified among healthy individuals, which includes Candida, Cladosporium, Saccharomycetales, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Cryptococcus, and Malassezia (22, 23). Although Aspergillus was seen in at least one oral sample in over 70% of the patients, it had a detectable abundance in only 13% of all longitudinal samples. Additionally, among the samples which had a detectable abundance of Aspergillus, the median relative abundance was only 1.8% (interquartile range [IQR], 0.03% to 8.4%). This observation was interesting given that Aspergillus is the primary cause of invasive mold infection among patients with hematologic malignancy (24). The abundances of the top ten most abundant genera showed significant intrapatient and interpatient variability across time (Fig. 1). However, the \u03b2-diversity appeared to be more homogeneous within each patient across time, with the mean intrapatient Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between samples within the same patient being 0.649 among the cohort members versus an average interpatient \u03b2-diversity value of 0.745 for all samples across time points. This is consistent with another study that analyzed the oral mycobiome stability over 30 days, which revealed high interindividual diversity and yet indicated intraindividual stability (25). Using the results of principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) shown in Fig. 2, we found no distinct grouping by patient or time point based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. We next sought to describe the oral mycobiome changes over the course of RIC. Through mixed-effects models, we found that mycobiome \u03b1-diversity did not significantly change over time (Chao1, P = 0.4639; Shannon, P = 0.8049; Simpson, P = 0.6637) (Fig. 3), unlike what has been previously been noted for the bacteriome, where diversity decreased from baseline until neutrophil recovery among leukemia patients receiving RIC (2, 26).",

In this sampling of patients, 72% were on high-intensity chemotherapy, while 28% received low-intensity chemotherapy (Table 1). The majority of patients (44%) received fludarabine-based regimens, with the majority of the regimens being FIA (idarubicin, cytarabine, and fludarabine) or FLAG-Ida (fludarabine, idarubicin, and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor). Twenty-eight percent of patients received nonfludarabine high-intensity regimens, which typically included CIA (idarubicin, cytarabine, and clofarabine)-based, IA (idarubicin and cytarabine)-based, or CLIA (cladribine, idarubicin, and cytarabine)-based regimens. Patients also receive hypomethylator-based treatments (such as decitabine or azacitadine) (13%) or other low-dose therapies to include LDAC (low-dose antimetabolite cytarabine)-based regimens (14%). Given the uneven sampling time (time to neutrophil recovery) among patients, we evaluated the mycobiome structure and composition at the baseline (T1), a midpoint (T3), and a later time point (T6), common among most patients. At T6, patients who received low-intensity RIC had significantly higher mycobiome \u03b1-diversity than patients who received high-intensity RIC (observed operational taxonomic units [OTUs], P = 0.02; Shannon, P = 0.054) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Although Kruskal-Wallis tests indicated that the relative abundances of the five most abundant fungal genera did not significantly differ between the four different chemotherapy subtypes at any single time point (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), we did determine chemotherapy subtypes to be significantly associated with the relative abundance of specific taxa over time. Specifically, patients who received high-intensity chemotherapies experienced a decrease in Malassezia abundance over time (P = 0.003, Fig. 4). This effect was not seen in other taxa analyzed (data not shown). To our knowledge, the changes in the oral mycobiome occurring as a result of chemotherapy have been studied only in regard to their role in chemotherapy-induced mucositis in the setting of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in mice and humans (13, 14). In patients, although the authors expected chemotherapy to affect the oral mycobiome, no major changes in the composition of fungal communities were observed (13). Thus, our study would be the first to show specific changes in the oral mycobiome associated with chemotherapeutic intensity and type.",

We examined the three primary empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics received in this cohort, which were carbapenems, cephalosporins, and piperacillin-tazobactam, and found that 87% of the patients were administered at least one of these three broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Some patients received more than one broad-spectrum antibiotic prior to neutrophil recovery, with 67% receiving a carbapenem, 44% a cephalosporin, and 28% piperacillin-tazobactam. We also evaluated the three primary treatment antifungals, consisting of echinocandins, amphotericin B, and triazoles. All patients were administered at least one of these three antifungals, with 79% receiving an azole, 77% an echinocandin, and 15% amphotericin B. We analyzed the later time point during RIC (T6) given that all antimicrobials analyzed were administered by T6 and that it was the latest time point common among most patients. Surprisingly, there was no significant association between the relative abundance of the top 5 most abundant fungal taxa at time point 6 and receipt of specific antimicrobials (Tables S2 toS7). However, amphotericin B seemed to have a significant effect on the composition of the oral fungal community over time. Patients who received amphotericin B experienced an increase in the relative abundance of Fusarium over time (P = 0.034) (Fig. 5). There is biological plausibility to this observation inasmuch as Fusarium species are associated with high amphotericin B MICs (27). Amphotericin B had no significant effect on the relative abundance of other taxa over time.",

We also considered the 31% of patients who had a clinically defined infection, such a pneumonia or cellulitis, in the absence of positive culture in our analysis. In analyzing the three major time points (T1, T3, and T6), we found that the relative abundance of Candida at T3 was significantly higher in patients that contracted microbiologically or clinically defined infections prior to neutrophil recovery (P = 0.008), while there was a significantly higher relative abundance of Fusarium (P = 0.03) at T6 in those that did not develop an infection prior to neutrophil recovery (Fig. 6). These results were corroborated using the LefSe (linear discriminant analysis of effect size) algorithm, where Candida was more differentially abundant at T3 among patients who developed an infection prior to neutrophil recovery (Fig. S2) and Fusarium more abundant at T6 among patients who did not have an infection (Fig. S3).

Thus, the impact of fungus-bacterium interactions in the oral cavity and on overall health is not completely understood. Although this exploratory study had a relatively small sample size and assessed only oral samples, the data shown here still highlight the dynamic nature of mycobiome and bacteriome communities and their interactions over the course of RIC. Unfortunately, the study design did not include information on diet, the metabolic milieu (e.g., other relevant comorbidities such as diabetes), oral health information (including oropharyngeal candidiasis), or occurrence of mucositis. These clinical factors/outcomes could potentially account for the heterogeneity seen within the data or might also be associated with specific mycobiome or bacteriome compositions/relationships. Despite not including a comprehensive record of clinical covariates, we were able to determine that specific changes in the mycobiome community structure appear to have clinical consequences in terms of bacterial infections. Moreover, interkingdom dynamics are likely driven by changes in the mycobiome due to chemotherapy intensity and subtype, as well as bacteriome changes driven by antibiotic exposures. Although this report highlights the underappreciated complex and dynamic nature of the cross-kingdom interactions that occur over time and result from the stress of chemotherapy and antibiotic therapy, these data are limited by our having used only marker gene analysis (16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer 2 [ITS2] sequencing) to identify bacterium-fungus dynamics. Target gene analysis is limited in its ability to differentiate individual taxa, specifically to lower taxonomic levels such as the species level. Although the ability to assemble and differentiate fungal reads at the whole-genome level is currently restricted by the number of fungal genomes available in public databases, this information could be vastly improved in the future via shotgun metagenomics sequencing, particularly in regard to functional pathway analysis. An alternative approach would be to layer on metabolomics or metaproteomics to understand the functional consequences of bacterial and fungal changes as well as the interkingdom metabolic pathway interactions. Again, however, methods for data integration of shotgun metagenomic and metabolomics data, particularly in regard to cross-domain networks, are still in their infancy.",

These oral samples and accompanying 16S rRNA gene sequences were derived from a previously reported cohort (2). The study protocol was approved by the MDACC Institutional Review Board (PA13-0339), and the study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment. Buccal swabs were collected by swabbing the inside the cheek 3 times on each side using a Catch-All sample collection swab (Epicentre), and the swab tips were then placed in sterile 2-ml cryovials and maintained at \u221280\u00b0C until DNA extraction. Collection of samples from each patient was performed at baseline, continued approximately every 96 h, and stopped upon neutrophil recovery. Clinical data, including antibiotic and antifungal administration, chemotherapy subtypes, and infection status, were extracted from the electronic medical records. Infections prior to neutrophil recovery were classified as microbiologically defined infections (MDI) or clinically defined infections (CDI) using established guidelines (35). Patients were categorized as receiving (i) non-fludarabine-based high-intensity regimens, (ii) high-intensity fludarabine-containing regimens, (iii) low-intensity hypomethylating-agent-based therapy, or (iv) other low-intensity/low-dose cytarabine-based regimens.",

We performed ITS sequencing on a subset of patients (the first sequential 39 patients enrolled on study with available residual sample) in which we had previously characterized the microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (2, 37\u201339). The internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region was amplified from oral swab DNA using primers ITS3 and ITS4 as described previously (36). Each primer included an Illumina adapter and linker sequence, and the reverse primer (ITS4) also contained a unique 12-bp Golay barcode (40). Amplicons were sequenced by the use of an Illumina MiSeq platform with the 2 \u00d7 300-bp paired-end protocol. The ITS2 read pairs were demultiplexed based on the unique barcodes. Reads were merged and filtered using default settings in USEARCH v7.0.1090 (41). ITS2 sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a similarity cutoff of 97% using the UPARSE pipeline (42). Chimeras were removed using USEARCH v8.0.1517 and UCHIME (43). OTUs were aligned against sequences from the NCBI GenBank Plant and UNITE databases (44). Abundance data were recovered by mapping the demultiplexed reads to the UPARSE OTUs. A custom script developed at the Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research at Baylor College of Medicine was used to construct an OTU table. Unmapped (<80% identity or <95% coverage) OTUs were manually analyzed by BLASTN (37). After we performed filtering that included only the samples which had corresponding clinical and 16S data to match the ITS data, 290 samples were obtained for further analyses.",

A mixed-effects model was applied to determine if time was a significant predictor of \u03b1-diversity. A random intercept for patients was included. A Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to compare \u03b1-diversity and taxon abundance data between chemotherapy subtype groups. In association testing, we focused on the top five most abundant fungal genera based on average abundance: Candida, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Similarly, a Mann-Whitney test was performed to compare both alpha-diversity data and taxon abundance data corresponding to chemotherapy intensity (high versus low), use of amphotericin B (yes versus no), and infection status (yes versus no). The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm was used to test whether taxon abundance predicted infection status. The LEfSe algorithm was run using the Galaxy module with default settings. Mixed-effects models were used to determine whether taxon abundance significantly changed over time. Analyses based on these models were performed on the centered log ratio (clr) transformed relative abundance data to address the compositional characteristics of the data. Each model contained the following variables: time point, the variable of interest, and an interaction between the two. To account for repeated measures, a random intercept for patient was included in the model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) F-test was applied to determine whether time and the variable of interest were significantly associated. The statistical analyses performed as a part of this study were exploratory in nature. In general, P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant; for analyses across the mycobiome, we computed false-discovery-rate (FDR)-adjusted P values, which are provided in the supplemental tables. Data analysis and visualization were performed using R, mainly using functions from the R packages ggplot2 and phyloseq (26, 45).",

For the tables listing bacterial and fungal genera, the data corresponding to time points 1 (T1), 3 (T3), and 6 (T6) were separated (46). As statistically sound methods for longitudinal analyses/trends are underdeveloped for microbiome network analyses, we aimed at analyzing samples at baseline prior to chemotherapy and antimicrobial administration (T1), at a time point after chemotherapy administration (T3), and at a time point after antimicrobial administration (T6). As we had significant sample dropout after T6, and given our already small sample size, T6 was the last time point which retained most samples. In addition, all patients who received broad-spectrum antibiotics had received at least one type of broad-spectrum antibiotic by T6. For each OTU table, taxa are included in the network analysis if the mean abundance was greater than 0.01. T1 had 35 samples with 16 bacterial taxa and 13 fungal taxa. T3 was represented by 36 samples, with 22 bacterial taxa and 16 fungal taxa. T6 contained 31 samples with 21 bacterial taxa and 15 fungal taxa. The sparsity parameter \u03bb was set to 0.3, and the value corresponding to \u03bb was set to 50. We verified the stability of our results for a single value of \u03bb. We also examined sensitivity across multiple \u03bb values and found that the networks were not sensitive to the choice of \u03bb.",
