            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), an emerging swine enteric coronavirus (CoV), belongs to the newly identified genus Deltacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales (Ma et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019). Clinically, PDCoV infection causes severe diarrhea and intestinal pathological damage in nursing piglets (Jung et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016a; Zhang, 2016). PDCoV was first identified in 2012 during molecular surveillance of CoVs in mammals and birds in Hong Kong (Woo et al., 2012). In 2014, outbreaks of PDCoV were reported in some states of the United States (Chen et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2015; Marthaler et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Thereafter, PDCoV was also detected in farmed pigs with diarrhea in other countries, including South Korea (Jang et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2016), China (Dong et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015), Thailand (Janetanakit et al., 2016), Japan (Suzuki et al., 2018), Laos, and Vietnam (Lorsirigool et al., 2016; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017), causing great economic losses in the swine industry. Recently, Jung and co-workers reported that calves are also susceptible to infection with PDCoV (Jung et al., 2017), sparking an increased interest in studying this emerging virus.",

            "text": "PDCoV is single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with an envelope, and its full-length genome, approximately 25.4 kb, is the smallest genome among the known CoVs (Ma et al., 2015; Woo et al., 2012). The typical genome of PDCoV successively contains 5\u02b9UTR-ORF1a-ORF1b-S-E-M-NS6-N-NS7-NS7a-3\u02b9UTR, which encodes two viral replicase polyproteins that are predicted to be proteolytically processed to yield 15 replication- and transcription-associated mature nonstructural proteins (nsps), four structural proteins, and three accessory proteins (Fang et al., 2017, 2016; Woo et al., 2012). Based on studies of other known CoVs, the proteases from PDCoV nsps that are required for viral replication and transcription have been predicted, such as papain-like protease nsp3, 3C-like protease nsp5, RNA-binding protein nsp9, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12, helicase nsp13, and endoribonuclease nsp15 (Mielech et al., 2014; Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 2017a, b). Of these, the endoribonuclease, termed NendoU, is highly conserved among vertebrate nidoviruses (coronaviruses and arteriviruses) but is not conserved among other RNA viruses, making it a genetic marker of this virus order (Ivanov et al., 2004; Snijder et al., 2013). NendoU, reported to have similarities to XendoU, specifically cleaves RNA at the level of 5\u02b9 uridines to release a 2\u02b9-3\u02b9-cyclic phosphate end product in the presence of Mn2+, which is considered to be an integral component of the replicase-transcriptase complex of nidoviruses and plays a critical role in viral replication and transcription (Athmer et al., 2017; Nedialkova et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Besides their roles in viral replication and transcription, the nsp15 of some CoVs and its orthologue nsp11 in arteriviruses have been demonstrated to antagonize innate immune responses. Overexpression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp15 significantly inhibits type I interferon (IFN) production, and the possible mechanism is via inhibiting MAVS-induced apoptosis (Frieman et al., 2009; Lei et al., 2009). However, this mechanism appears not to be shared by other CoVs (Lei et al., 2009). Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp15 has been shown to suppress poly(I:C)-induced type I and type III IFN responses and the endoribonuclease activity appears to be not required for PEDV replication in IFN-deficient Vero cells (Zhang et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2019). A recombinant mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 with a mutation in the active site of endoribonuclease nsp15 can stimulate an early and robust induction of type I IFN in macrophages by activating host double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors, indicating that MHV A59 nsp15 may function as an IFN antagonist during MHV infection (Deng et al., 2017). Several studies have demonstrated that arterivirus nsp11 s inhibit innate immune responses and their endoribonuclease activity is required (Shi et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2016). Additionally, our previous studies showed that PDCoV infection suppresses RIG-I-mediated production of IFN-\u03b2 (Luo et al., 2016). However, whether or not PDCoV nsp15 is also a type I IFN antagonist remains unclear.",

The mRNA expression levels of IFN-\u03b2 were also decreased compared with the control group in both cell lines (Fig. 1\nB and D). To further verify the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production on protein level by PDCoV nsp15, the IFN bioassay was performed by using an IFN-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus expressing green fluorescent protein (VSV-GFP). As shown in Fig. 1\nE and F, the cellular supernatants from SEV-infected LLC-PK1 and HEK-293T cells notably suppressed the replication of VSV-GFP in both cell lines. However, the replication of VSV-GFP was partially restored by the presence of supernatants from cells expressing PDCoV nsp15 compared to that of supernatants from empty vector-transfected cells.

Western blot assays were performed on lysates of these cells to analyze the phosphorylation levels of IRF3 and p65. As shown in Fig. 2\nE and F, the phosphorylation levels of endogenous IRF3 and p65 were both markedly higher following SEV infection, compared with the levels in mock-infected cells. In line with our previous results from luciferase reporter assays, the SEV-induced p65 phosphorylation in nsp15-expressing cells was notably inhibited, but nsp15 failed to impede the IRF3 phosphorylation induced by SEV in both LLC-PK1 (Fig. 2\nE) and HEK-293T cells (Fig. 2\nF). The results of nuclear translocation assays of IRF3 and p65 also showed that nsp15 expression inhibited the SEV-induced nuclear translocation of p65 in both LLC-PK1 (Fig. 2\nG) and HEK-293T cells (Fig. 2\nH), but not that of IRF3 in both cell lines (data not shown). Overall, these results demonstrate that PDCoV nsp15 antagonizes SEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production mainly by inhibiting the activation of NF-\u03baB.",

We also analyzed the phosphorylation levels of endogenous IRF3 and p65 after the overexpression of nsp15 mutants in both LLC-PK1 (Fig. 4\nC) and HEK-293T (Fig. 4\nD) cells, and the results demonstrated that cells transfected with any of the three mutants, similar to the WT nsp15, markedly decreased p65 phosphorylation compared to the cells transfected with empty vector, while the expression levels of total IRF3 and p65 and the phosphorylation level of IRF3 were similar among all groups (Fig. 4\nC and D). Using the mutant H234A as a representative, we analyzed the nuclear translocation of endogenous IRF3 and p65 after the overexpression of a nsp15 mutant. Similar to the WT nsp15, when the mutant H234A was ectopically expressed, it also inhibited the SEV-induced nuclear translocation of p65 in both LLC-PK1 (Fig. 4\nE) and HEK-293T cells (Fig. 4\nF), but did not affect IRF3 translocation in both cell lines (data not shown).

            "text": "As a unique endoribonuclease encoded by nidoviruses, the functions of nsp15 of CoVs (nsp11 in arteriviruses) have been received more attentions. Previous studies showed that the nsp15 encoded by SARS-CoV (Frieman et al., 2009), MHV (Deng et al., 2017), PEDV (Zhang et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2019) and the nsp11 encoded by PRRSV (Shi et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2016) can antagonize antiviral innate immune responses. Our present study also found that the nsp15 of PDCoV antagonizes type I IFN production, suggesting that it may be a common property for the endoribonuclease of nidoviruses to antagonizes IFN production. However, it is appears that different mechanisms are utilized by the endoribonucleases from different nidoviruses. For example, the nsp15 s of MHV and HCoV-229E prevent the activation of IFN response by mediating the evasion of host recognition of viral dsRNA (Deng et al., 2017; Kindler et al., 2017); PRRSV nsp11, the orthologue of CoV nsp15, antagonizes type I IFN production by suppressing both MAVS and RIG-I expression (Sun et al., 2016). SARS-CoV nsp15 antagonizes type I IFN production by inhibiting MAVS-induced apoptosis (Lei et al., 2009), however, MERS-CoV nsp15 does not utilize this strategy although it also inhibits type I IFN production with a yet-to-be identified mechanism. More recently, PEDV nsp15 has been demonstrated to be involved in IFN antagonize through a possible mechanism similar to the nsp15 of MHV and HCoV-229E (Deng et al., 2019). Although different mechanisms are utilized by the endoribonucleases from different nidoviruses, it appears that all tested endoribonucleases inhibit the activations of both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB, the two critical transcription factors for induction of type I IFN production. In this study, we found that PDCoV nsp15 antagonizes IFN-\u03b2 production by impairing the activation of transcription factor NF-\u03baB, but not IRF3, which is a different strategy from other reported endoribonucleases of nidoviruses.",

            "text": "Although all tested endoribonuclease of nidoviruses have been demonstrated to antagonize IFN production, it is still inconclusive whether this function fully depends on its endoribonuclease activity. Several studies showed that overexpression of WT nsp15 s of CoV or nsp11 s of arterivirus significantly suppressed IFN production, while the mutants lacking endoribonuclease activity lost this capacity (Kindler et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2016). These evidences appear to indicate that the endoribonuclease activity is essential for nsp15/nsp11-mediated inhibition of IFN production. However, the WT nsp15 s or nsp11 s have been demonstrated to be extremely toxic to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, on the contrary, no cytotoxicity could be observed in cells overexpressing nsp15/nsp11 mutants lacking endoribonuclease activity (Deng and Baker, 2018; Sun et al., 2016). Thus, many researchers suspected that the suppression of IFN production by WT nsp15/nsp11 is due to its cytotoxicity (Deng and Baker, 2018; Shi et al., 2016). In addition, although MHV A59 mutant expressing a catalysis-deficient nsp15 induces robust type I IFN production compared to wild-type MHV in the infected macrophages, however, another mutant expressing an unstable nsp15 also exhibits similar property (Deng et al., 2017). Thus, no direct evidence for the linkage between endoribonuclease activity and type I IFN antagonism has been obtained. In this study, we found that PDCoV nsp15 antagonizes IFN production independent on its endoribonuclease activity. Both WT nsp15 and its mutants lacking endoribonuclease activity inhibited type I IFN production to a similar degree. These results indicated that PDCoV nsp15 has evolved a novel mechanism for the antagonism of IFN production in an endoribonuclease activity-independent manner, distinct from that reported previously for the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production by other CoV nsp15 s or arterivirus nsp11 s. The reason that results in these differences remains unclear. In terms of structure, the active form of endoribonuclease from PDCoV nsp15 is different from that of other CoV nsp15 s. PDCoV nsp15 is a mixture of dimers and monomers, while the nsp15 s of SARS-CoV, MHV, HCoV-229E, as well as MERS-CoV, function as a hexamer (Ricagno et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018). Whether these structure differences result in different mechanisms used to antagonize IFN production remains further study. In addition, it should be noted that this study involved the individual expression of PDCoV nsp15, outside the context of infection. However, we also compared the inhibitory effects of PEDV WT nsp15 and its mutant (nsp15 H226A) lacking endoribonuclease activity in overexpression system, and found that the PEDV WT nsp15 significantly inhibited IFN-\u03b2 production, while such an inhibitory effect was not observed in cells overexpressing mutant nsp15 H226A (data not shown). Because the reverse genetics system of PDCoV is not available nowadays, it is difficult to investigate the IFN antagonist activity of PDCoV nsp15 in the context of virus infection. We are now working to establish a reverse genetics system of PDCoV, which will allow the generation of mutant or deletion viruses to investigate the precise mechanism of PDCoV nsp15-mediated inhibition of type I IFN.",
