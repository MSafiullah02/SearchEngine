All influenza A viruses have antigenically similar nucleocapsid and matrix proteins. Concentrated virus preparations containing either or both of these antigens are used in the AGID test. The antigen preparation is added to a centre well in an agar\u2010gel matrix and the positive control sera and poultry test sera are added to surrounding wells. The agar plates are incubated overnight and if a serum sample is positive for antibodies to influenza A viruses, a precipitation line will generally form where the antigen and antibodies meet. However, not all species produce precipitating antibodies. For example, some avian species do not form precipitins to various antigens (Toth & Norcross, 1981; Higgins, 1989). While the AGID is a standard test in the poultry industry, it has not been validated for the use with any species other than domestic chickens and turkeys (OIE, 2008).",

Known subtypes of influenza viruses are mixed with serum samples and then added to chicken RBCs (OIE, 2008). If the serum in question contains antibodies specific to that influenza subtype, then the antibodies will bind to the virus and prevent the virus from agglutinating the RBCs. An HI titer is assigned based on the last dilution of sera that prevents hemagglutination. With the HI test, the HA subtype and antibody titer can be determined, although titers may differ slightly between laboratories.",

            "text": "Originally, it was hypothesized that AI viruses do not induce a humoral (antibody) response in mammals, because antibody detection in AI\u2010infected ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) was found to be lower than that in ferrets infected with mammalian\u2010derived strains of influenza A virus (Hinshaw et al., 1981). However, subsequent AI studies conducted on ferrets, ducks, pigs and mice suggested that the failure to detect mammalian antibodies specific to AI viruses was actually due to problems with the HI test (Lu, Webster & Hinshaw, 1982; Kida et al., 1994; Ninomiya et al., 2002). While mammalian antibodies to AI viruses frequently did not inhibit hemagglutination of homologous avian\u2010derived virions, these antibodies did inhibit hemagglutination of viral subunit antigens and/or mammalian\u2010derived viruses of the same subtype (Lu, Webster & Hinshaw, 1982). More recently, the HI test has been improved for detecting antibodies against AI viruses in humans by using horse RBCs in the assay (2003, 2004; Puzelli et al., 2005; Gill et al., 2006; Meijer et al., 2006; Traenor et al., 2006; Jia et al., 2008). Horse erythrocytes contain almost exclusively SA\u03b12,3\u2010Gal linkages (the cellular binding sites of AI viruses), whereas the traditionally used chicken or turkey RBCs contain a mixture of SA\u03b12,6\u2010Gal (the cellular binding sites for human\u2010derived influenza viruses) and SA\u03b12,3\u2010Gal linkages (Stephenson et al., 2003). While the horse\u2010RBC HI test has worked well for testing selected mammalian sera for most AI subtypes, problems in identifying exposure to the H7 subtype still have not been resolved (WHO, 2006b; Kayali et al., 2008).",

            "text": "VN tests are often considered the \u2018gold standards\u2019 of serology. In influenza testing, the VN test detects subtype specific circulating antibodies directed against the HA antigen (Stephenson et al., 2007). Briefly, infectious virus of a known subtype is combined with serum samples, allowed to incubate and added to a cell monolayer (usually MDCK cells) for 3\u20134 days. Results are often expressed as a titer based on cytopathic effect in the monolayer caused by viral infection. The MN test is a variation of the VN assay performed in microtiter plates with \u2018next day\u2019 results expressed as a titer based on an enzymatic reaction. The MN assay can therefore accommodate more samples at once and produce more timely results (Okuno et al., 1990; Rowe et al., 1999). Although considered equally (or more) sensitive and strain\u2010specific as the horse RBC HI tests, VN and MN titers can also differ slightly between laboratories (Stephenson et al., 2007; Kayali et al., 2008; Wood, 2008). Inter\u2010laboratory differences in sera preparation, quantity of virus added, neutralization time and dilution may all contribute to variability (Stephenson et al., 2007). To compare results between laboratories, suggested VN and MN protocols have been published by WHO for influenza surveillance in lower mammals and birds (WHO, 2002).",

These assays use antibody diffusion in agar gel and the hemolyzing property of influenza antigen\u2010antibody complexes to measure the antibody content of test sera (Morley et al., 1995). Influenza virus particles are attached to the surface of RBCs and combined with a source of complement (serum proteins that aid in immune response) and agar in a Petri dish. After the gel has cooled, heat inactivated serum samples are added to wells. As plates are incubated, antibody from serum samples diffuses from the wells into the gel at a rate proportional to the concentration of antibodies. HA\u2010specific antibodies attach to a homologous virus\u2010RBC complex causing complement mediated hemolysis as it diffuses through the gel. The size of the resulting zone of hemolysis is proportional to the amount of HA\u2010specific antibody contained in the test samples. The SRH test has sensitivity equivalent to the VN and horse RBC HI tests for detecting H5\u2010specific antibodies in human sera (Stephenson et al., 2003). Although the clarity of zones is sometimes variable, the test is rapid, convenient and can be performed with inactivated viruses (Wood et al., 2001).",

The cELISA has been evaluated for use with chickens, turkeys, game birds, ratitites and penguins (Shafer, Katz & Eernisse, 1998). In these avian species, the cELISA was more sensitive and more specific than the AGID test (Shafer, Katz & Eernisse, 1998), as sensitive and specific as the HI test (Shafer, Katz & Eernisse, 1998), and able to detect some antibodies earlier in infection than the AGID and HI tests (Zhou et al., 1998). While the cELISA has only been evaluated for use with avian sera, the bELISA has been used to assess exposure of some mammals to human and swine influenza viruses. The bELISA detected antibodies to influenza A viruses in naturally infected marine mammals, in ferrets experimentally infected with human influenza isolates and in swine experimentally infected with swine influenza isolates (De Boer, Back & Osterhaus, 1990).",

Because of their susceptibility to AI infection and their potential contact with domestic animals and/or humans (e.g. through overlapping habitats or feeding behaviours, or via \u2018wet\u2010markets\u2019 where livestock are sold alive), certain wild mammal species may be capable of transmitting AI viruses between wild waterfowl and domestic animals or humans (Clark & Hall, 2006). Increased interest in the role of wild mammals in influenza ecology has led to wildlife biologists entering the field once occupied only by poultry producers, human and veterinary diagnosticians, and primary influenza research laboratories. Studies are already underway to characterize seroprevalences in some wild mammalian species (2008a, 2008b; Marschall et al., 2008). While there is a need for these studies, researchers must choose diagnostic tests carefully to avoid underreporting influenza virus exposure. Table 1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages, potential pitfalls and necessary protocol adjustments when using traditional serological tests for wild mammal seroprevalence studies. However, even with protocol adjustments, a WHO working group on influenza research has expressed concern that some human seroprevalence studies may still be reporting false\u2010negative H5 and H7 results due to possible limitations and variability of serological tests (WHO, 2006b).",

It is also important that validation is not a \u2018one\u2010time\u2019 experiment, but that assays are continually reassessed for different species, pathogens and other conditions (Jacobson, 1998).
