Travelers can become infected and then infect others. In some instances, this can lead to multiple generations of spread or sustained transmission in a new area. Finally, diagnoses of travelers in resource-rich regions can yield knowledge about infectious disease agents acquired in resource-poor areas. This knowledge can be used to alert the global community to the presence or susceptibility patterns of pathogens in different regions; inform strategies that can be used to control infections in developing countries; and prepare travelers to those areas and guide the care of those returning. Travelers should be considered an integral part of the global surveillance network for emerging infections.",
