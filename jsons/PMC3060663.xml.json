            "text": "Enterovirus (EV) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The EV genus is part of the picornavirus family and includes such notable members as poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus (CV), and enterovirus-71 (EV-71). EVs have been associated with many human diseases, including myocarditis (Klingel et al., 1992), pancreatitis (Ramsingh, 2008), and chronic inflammatory myopathy (Tam and Messner, 1999). Diseases caused by EV are not restricted to the well-known scourge of mankind throughout history, recognized as poliomyelitis. Many non-polio human EVs are quite common, causing an estimated 10\u201315 million or more symptomatic infections in the US alone. Non-polio EVs are known to target the central nervous system (CNS) and are responsible for numerous clinical manifestations, including encephalitis, and meningitis (Michos et al., 2007). The long-term consequences of EV infection upon the CNS are largely unknown. However, these viruses are known to persist, and the presence of viral RNA by itself has been shown to be potentially pathogenic in some cases. Also, EVs have been linked to autoimmune-like diseases, including diabetes, chronic inflammatory myopathy, and chronic myocarditis, perhaps in part due to the long-term presence of viral material. Therefore, EVs may be able to persist within the CNS potentially causing lasting neuropathology.",

However, the significant level of phylogenetic overlap among the four groups has led to a new classification system of consecutive numbers for the more recently isolated viruses (such as Enterovirus-71, Enterovirus-72, etc.) (Oberste et al., 2002). Our review will cover the most common and more extensively studied types of enteroviruses. However, the large number of circulating strains in human populations alone suggests a potential role for these viruses for unknown or unappreciated human diseases (Victoria et al., 2009). Also, vaccine design against enteroviruses may be difficult based on significant EV genetic variability.",

Although the advent of polio vaccination has proven effective in greatly reducing the incidence of disease, some cases still occur and these cases appear to be on the rise; outbreaks following wild PV importations into previously polio-free countries continue to be an ongoing risk (MMWR, 2010). Over the years, basic research on PV has revealed the mechanics of protein translation and viral replication, immune activation, vaccine development, and viral population dynamics (Cameron et al., 2010, Pfeiffer, 2010). These discoveries have provided valuable information for the ongoing research of non-polio enteroviruses which continue to cause encephalitis and meningitis in humans.",

Infants infected with CV have been shown to be extremely susceptible to myocarditis, meningitis and encephalitis with a subsequent mortality rate as high as 10%. Also, a number of delayed neuropathologies have been associated with previous CV infection, including schizophrenia (Rantakallio et al., 1997, Suvisaari et al., 2003), encephalitis lethargica (Cree et al., 2003), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Woodall and Graham, 2004, Woodall et al., 1994).

Therefore, we have included relevant information on TMEV and CNS pathology in this review. Two main subtypes of TMEV are studied in animal models. The strain GDVII produces acute encephalomyelitis quickly in mice. The DA, WW, or BeAn strains persist within the CNS and induce demyelinating plaques similar to those seen in multiple sclerosis. More detailed reviews of TMEV tropism, immune response, persistence, and demyelination have been published by other research groups (Brahic et al., 2005, Lipton et al., 2005, Oleszak et al., 2004, Olson et al., 2005, Rodriguez, 2007).",

EVs consist of icosahedral, non-enveloped viruses of approximately 30 nm in diameter. These viruses generally have the proclivity to survive acidic environment, enabling their passage through the stomach following fecal/oral transmission and eventual invasion into the small intestine. The viral capsid contains the positive-strand RNA genome, ranging in size from ~ 7.2 to 8.5 kb. The viral genome includes several cis-acting RNA elements which play a role in replication and/or translation. These cis-acting elements include the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 nontranslated regions (NTRs), the cis-acting replication element (CRE) and the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail (Steil and Barton, 2009).",

            "text": "A single open reading frame (ORF) within the NTRs encodes a long viral protein which undergoes post-translational cleavage into the mature viral proteins. These viral proteins include the four structural proteins, VP1\u20134 which comprise the viral capsid, and seven non-structural proteins (2A\u2013C and 3A\u2013D) including the primer- and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3DPol) (Kitamura et al., 1981). In addition, one of the viral proteins 3B (also known as VPg) covalently attaches to the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome. VPg plays an essential role in viral replication by acting as a primer for RNA synthesis. Utilizing PV as a model, VPg has been shown to undergo uridylylation to VPgpUpU by 3DPol using adenosine residues in the stem-loop structure of CRE, located in the 2C region of the EV ORF, as a template (Goodfellow et al., 2000, Paul et al., 2003). Recent elucidation by NMR suggests that VPg undergoes a structural change upon uridylylation which allows viral replication to be more efficient and selective (Schein et al., 2010). Since uridylylation is not observed during host cell transcription, this process may be a unique therapeutic target against EV infections, given that point mutations that block uridylylation may prevent viral growth (Paul et al., 1998). While VPg plays a role in both positive- and negative-strand RNA synthesis, it is still unknown how approximately 40 to 70 copies of positive-strand genome are produced for every negative-strand genome during an EV infection (Novak and Kirkegaard, 1991). Intriguingly, this ratio decreases upon the establishment of CVB3 persistence within the CNS suggesting that a double-stranded RNA genomic structure might assist in virus stability during persistence (Feuer et al., 2009).",

For example, the well-characterized internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5\u2032 NTR directly interacts with host cell ribosomes to initiate translation of the viral genome upon entering the cell (Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988). Immediate translation is necessary in order to produce the primer- and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase needed for viral replication, as well as the other viral proteins that facilitate replication. The viral genome is translated into a ~ 250-kDa polyprotein, which undergoes a series of cleavages at predetermined cleavage sites carried out by the viral proteases 2Apro and 3CDpro. During proteolytic processing, several precursor protein intermediates also play important roles during viral infection.",

This complex associates with poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP1), which is bound to the poly(A) tail of the genome, and causes the genome to circularize during negative-strand synthesis (Herold and Andino, 2001). Further analysis of the crystal structure of 3CD has shown that the N-terminus is in close proximity to the VPg binding site, and that 3CD may be involved in the uridylylation reaction as part of the replication complex (Marcotte et al., 2007). Moreover, 3AB (also the VPg precursor protein) is a membrane bound protein (Fujita et al., 2007), thus providing a spatial link between viral replication on host membranes, viral priming and the replication complex.",

Additionally, the 3C protein of EV-71 has recently been shown to block polyadenylation of host mRNA by cleaving a critical factor needed for this process (Weng et al., 2009). In turn, viral protease 2A halts host cell cap-dependent translation by cleaving eIF4G, which in a clever twist also enhances the translation of viral mRNA by stabilizing polysomes (Etchison et al., 1982, Kempf and Barton, 2008).

Viral protein 2B is a highly efficient viroporin which can permeabilize the host cell membrane, as well as those of nearby cells (Madan et al., 2010). However, the pathways activated in the cell during infection can be somewhat contradictory. In what is thought to be an attempt by the virus to keep the cell alive long enough to complete viral replication and eventually escape its cellular confinements, EVs induce both anti-apoptotic (3A and 2B proteins) and pro-apoptotic effects (VP2, 2A and 3C proteins) on the host cell (Whitton et al., 2005). Furthermore, viral protein synthesis, which is boosted by 2A, has been shown to be necessary for apoptosis (Shih et al., 2008). With several reports demonstrating apoptosis in neurons after EV infection, and the role of 2A in regulating translation, it is interesting to speculate that shutoff of host cell translation by EVs may directly cause apoptotic cell death in neurons. We have shown that CVB3 induced apoptosis within pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (Feuer et al., 2003). In contrast, TMEV may indirectly induce apoptosis of nearby pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus in non-cell autonomous manner (Buenz et al., 2009).",

A recent study has shown a link between decreased CAR expression in differentiated primary neurons and a reduction in CVB3 infection, suggesting that susceptibility to infection may diminish as the level of virus receptor decreases during the differentiation process (Ahn et al., 2008). Similarly, PV infection and tissue tropism was largely found to be restricted by hPVR expression in the CNS of hPVR promoter-driven beta-galactosidase transgenic mice (Gromeier et al., 1995). Analysis of receptor distribution in hPVR promoter-driven beta-galactosidase transgenic mice during development showed high levels of protein expression in the spinal cord anterior horn motor neurons which are known to harbor infection in the mature CNS (Gromeier et al., 2000). Although some EV receptors may be widely expressed in tissues including the CNS, additional cellular determinants may ultimately control tropism. For example, CAR expression is relatively widespread in the murine neonatal CNS (Honda et al., 2000, Hotta et al., 2003, Venkatraman et al., 2005) and utilized by adenovirus \u2014 a DNA virus with substantial tropism differences as compared to CVB3. Yet, early CVB3 infection is largely restricted to neural progenitor and stem cells (NPSCs) (Fig. 1\n) or infiltrating myeloid cells during early infection (Feuer et al., 2005) (Fig. 2\n). The proliferative status of these cells may provide an additional level of susceptibility to infection (Feuer et al., 2002, Feuer et al., 2003, Feuer et al., 2005, Feuer and Whitton, 2008).",

Infection of NPSCs may assist in expanding the tropism of CVB3 upon their differentiation into the three neural lineages \u2014 neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Previously, we determined that CVB3 preferentially replicates within actively proliferating cells (Feuer et al., 2002). Hence, NPSCs may be considered ideal host cells for infection.",

Third, NPSCs might be altered upon their differentiation into neurons. Alterations in neuronal function may lead to behavioral modifications within the host, which may act to maximize virus transmission. Fourth, targeting of NPSCs might be a strategy of CVB3 to establish persistent infection with sporadic reactivation whenever quiescent stem cells become activated to generate downstream progenitor cells (Fig. 3\n). The majority of primary neural stem cells at any moment in time might be expected to remain within a quiescent state. Therefore, CVB3 replication may be temporarily arrested in the host cell until a later point in time when the production of virions may be of benefit to viral transmission, perhaps through the olfactory neuroepithelium. Finally, normal immune responses may be suppressed within neurogenic regions, either due to the immunoprivileged status of the CNS, or potentially reduced antiviral responses in these crucial neural stem cells.",

Instead, targeting of intrajunctional proteins such as CAR by CVB3 might be a sophisticated viral strategy to specifically infect migratory immune cells as they undergo diapedesis through the tight junctions. In this regard, we have recently shown the ability of CVB3 to infect nestin + myeloid cells upon their infiltration across the tight junctions of the choroid plexus epithelial cells comprising the blood-cerebral spinal fluid-barrier in response to early CNS infection (Tabor-Godwin et al., 2010).

Second, immune cells responding to inflammation or injury tend to be highly activated or undergoing proliferation, and each virus may induce unique chemokine profiles early after infection to attract their immune cells of choice. CVB3 has been shown previously to preferentially replicate within activated or proliferating cells. Third, virions carried internally by immune cells might temporarily shield the virus from neutralizing antibodies upon dissemination. Neutralizing antibodies are thought to play a major role in limiting EV infections, and hypogamma-globulinemic patients deficient in humoral immunity are highly susceptible to EV infection. Perhaps not surprisingly, other viruses have been shown to bind to intrajunctional proteins (Bergelson, 2009), suggesting that the proposed mechanism above might be a general feature of virus dissemination within the host. Therefore, rather than being a hindrance to virus entry \u2014 which might be expected for receptors sequestered within highly inaccessible areas \u2014 virus evolution may have optimized virion attachment to intrajunctional proteins to maximize viral spread using immune target cell \u201cTrojan horses\u201d which become infected during their migration across tight junctions. Supporting this hypothesis, evidence for viral targeting of lymphocytes or monocytes for spread into primary target organs and maximal viral replication has been described for CVB3 (Mena et al., 1999) and other viruses (Noda et al., 2006).",

The two main models of PV entry into the CNS both involve viremia, or the presence of virus in the blood, after the virus has replicated in the lymphatic tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. One hypothesis simply proposes the direct movement of the virus through the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in an hPVR-independent manner (Yang et al., 1997).

Of note, PV has been shown to infect monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells in an hPVR-dependent manner (Freistadt et al., 1993, Wahid et al., 2005). In addition, lymphocytes may play a role in monocyte infection by inducing their activation and facilitating viral replication (Eberle et al., 1995). Further investigation has revealed a possible link between PV pathogenesis in the CNS and monocyte infection, as neurovirulent strains were found to replicate more efficiently in monocytes (Freistadt and Eberle, 1996). As described above, CVB3 and also EV-71 have been shown to replicate in immune cells, B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes and cells of the myeloid lineage (Haddad et al., 2004, Vuorinen et al., 1996). Our laboratory has recently revealed the rapid infiltration of a novel population of nestin + myeloid cells into the neonatal CNS following CVB3 infection (Tabor-Godwin et al., 2010). These cells are highly susceptible to CVB3 infection and move into the brain parenchyma over time, suggesting a role in viral dissemination. The growing number of studies demonstrating EV infection of immune cells suggests that further investigation of the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d model of CNS invasion may be warranted.",

Other contributing factors during viral replication may also increase viral diversity.

Recent elegant work utilizing a PV variant encoding a mutation in 3DPol isolated during serial passage in the presence of ribavirin has revealed the critical nature of viral quasispecies in contributing to invasion of the CNS. The PV isolate (G64S) was shown to increase the fidelity of the viral polymerase and decrease quasispecies diversity (Vignuzzi et al., 2006). The G64S PV isolate was less neurovirulent than wild type virus, and CNS invasion failed to occur unless the isolate was co-inoculated in combination with a diverse quasispecies population. These intriguing results demonstrated that cooperation between variants within a viral population was necessary for CNS invasion and the ensuing neuropathology. Cooperation among viral genotypes might include evasion of the immune response simultaneously with CNS invasion.",

This antiviral genetic bottleneck effect, also referred to as the \u201cburned-bridge\u201d model, may contribute to the rare transmission of PV into the CNS which occurs in approximately 1 to 2% of cases (Gromeier and Wimmer, 1998). Later studies have added to the \u201cburned-bridge\u201d model whereby multiple barriers may contribute to genetic bottleneck effects of quasispecies. These barriers which may limit neurovirulence include the integrity of the gut, the induction of a protective innate immune response, and inefficiency in neuronal transport of virus (Kuss et al., 2008, Lancaster and Pfeiffer, 2010). Thus, EV entrance into the brain appears to be a complicated interplay not only between the virus and the host, but also among viral variants within the quasispecies population.",

In contrast, EV-71 induced only limited damage in both the extrapyramidal and pyramidal tracts, leaving many motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spine intact (Nagata et al., 2004).

Tropism at the cellular level can be viewed as an interplay of at least three general factors: the ability of the virus to infect and replicate in the specific host tissues; the capability of the host cell to clear the virus; and the capacity of the virus to avoid clearance by the host. Potential differences in the magnitude of the interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 response may greatly influence PV tissue tropism (Ida-Hosonuma et al., 2005, Yoshikawa et al., 2006). The tropism of PV for neurons has previously been shown to be also determined by the PV Internal Ribosomal Entry Site (IRES) (Kauder and Racaniello, 2004). Kauder et al. initially found that the tropism of PV towards nervous tissues could not be fully explained by organ-specific differences in IRES-mediated translation within age-matched samples. They investigated alterations in PV tropism by generating recombinant viruses engineered to contain the IRES from human rhinovirus (Kauder et al., 2006). In this manner, the investigators observed IRES-mediated, organ-specific translational differences between EVs in adult versus neonatal infection. They concluded that these differences might be attributed to IRES trans-acting Factors (ITAFs) differentially expressed in various cell types, including neurons.",

Neurons may be more susceptible to infection due to the availability of specific ITAFs needed to initiate IRES-mediated translation. Investigation of TMEV and FMDV IRESs suggested that cell-specific differences in ITAFs may explain why some viruses are able to replicate in neurons, while others cannot (Pilipenko et al., 2000). Furthermore, translation initiation of different EVs IRES may depend on a combination of different ITAFs and eukaryotic initiation factors which may have different cell-specific levels of abundance (Boussadia et al., 2003).

For example, PV can infect astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Couderc et al., 2002). Also, it has been known for some time that TMEV can infect astrocytes, yet persist in oligodendrocytes (Rodriguez et al., 1983). EV-71 has been found to readily infect and replicate in astrocytoma cultures (Kung et al., 2007) and cultures of rat brain astrocytes (Tung et al., 2010). We have shown that CVB3 preferentially infects NPSCs (Feuer and Whitton, 2008), and more recently, a novel population of nestin + myeloid cells infiltrating into the CNS (Tabor-Godwin et al., 2010). Parechoviruses (P-ECHO-Vs) are suspected to be taken up by microglia which leads to the activation of these resident immune cells (Volpe, 2008). Also, microglia, and glial cells may be potential sites of EV persistence. For example, macrophages and microglia have been found to be the main reservoir for harboring TMEV during persistent infection (Roussarie et al., 2007). Respiratory EV, including rhinoviruses (RVs), have not been historically found to infect the CNS. However, a recent study suggested that recombination of respiratory EV to genetically similar viruses, such as CV and PV, may eventually lead to respiratory EVs with tropism for the central nervous system (Tapparel et al., 2009). This possibility is not implausible, especially with the recent findings suggesting the contribution of viral variants or quasispecies to PV spread into the CNS (Vignuzzi et al., 2006).",

An informative review of chemokine induction in response to neurotropic infections has recently been published by Hosking and Lane (2010). These chemoattractant molecules may be especially critical to combating microbes within immunoprivileged sites, such as the CNS. We have demonstrated the induction of numerous chemokines in the CNS following CVB3 infection. One particular chemokine, CCL12, may play an essential role in the recruitment of nestin + myeloid cells that infiltrate across the blood-CSF-barrier and become infected upon their entry through the choroid plexus (Tabor-Godwin et al., 2010). \u201cBystander\u201d casualties suffered upon activation of cytolytic T cells during an adaptive immune response within the CNS may be potentially more devastating to neurons than a viral infection itself. Thus, the host may restrict or control immune responses in response to a viral infection within immunoprivileged sites; this restriction may partly explain why certain viruses may preferentially target the CNS.",

EVs have been shown to activate essential innate immune response molecules, including Toll-like Receptor 3 (TLR3), Retinoic Acid Inducible Gene I (RIG-I), and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated Gene 5 (MDA5). TLR3 is located on the membrane of endosomes or the plasma membrane and recognizes double-stranded RNA, a structure generally observed during viral replication of all RNA viruses. Recent studies suggest that TLR3 plays a strong role in cardioprotection against EV infections and may depend on autophagic processes (Gorbea et al., 2010). Studies of the recognition of EVs by cytoplasmic sensors of the innate immune response have largely centered on DExD/H-box-containing RNA helicases, such as RIG-I and MDA5. In examining encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) induction of the type I interferon (IFN) response in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Kato et al. concluded that MDA5, but not RIG-I, was critical for picornavirus detection (Kato et al., 2006). However, this does not mean that RIG-I is excluded from picornavirus detection. By utilizing MDA-5 knockout mice, Papon et al. observed that RIG-I was also useful in detecting EMCV (Papon et al., 2009). Both of these sensors may play important roles in EV detection by the host. EVs may circumvent the action of these molecules by encoding proteins that affect their signaling pathways.",

TLR-3, RIG-1, and MDA5 are all able to induce the type I IFN response. TLR-3 induces the production of type I IFNs by activating the transcription factors Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3), NF-\u03baB, and AP-I through the adaptor protein TIR-domain-containing Adapter Inducing Interferon \u03b2 (TRIF) (Matsumoto and Seya, 2008, Wilkins and Gale, 2010). The RIG-I and MDA-5 pathways are distinct and independent of the TLR-3 pathway. RIG-I and MDA-5 both interact with the adaptor molecule IPS-1 through their CARD domains. IPS-1 transfers the activation signal to downstream kinases, which in turn activate IRF-3 and other transcription factors involved in type I IFN induction (Kato et al., 2006). Malathi et al. determined that the helicase activity of RIG-I and MDA5 may have important autoregulatory roles and work in concert with Endoribonuclease L (RNase L) to produce small self RNA cleavage products that can interact with RIG-I or MDA5, thereby amplifying the signal (Malathi et al., 2007).",

Binding of type I IFNs to their receptor induces the transcription of antiviral miRNAs and IFN Stimulated Genes (ISGs) through the JAK/STAT pathway. Many of these ISGs encode antiviral products or serve to further upregulate the type I IFN pathway. For example, RNase L is an ISG that contributes to the amplification of the type I IFN response, but also cleaves viral RNA and inhibits their translation. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of RNase L has been found to have a protective role in the CNS against coronavirus-induced demyelination. In comparing wildtype and RNase L\u2212/\u2212 mice, Ireland et al. found that RNase L deficiencies increased demyelination and axonal damage in the brain following infection, and affected the regulation apoptosis (Ireland et al., 2009). Additional ISGs encode products that can inhibit specific viruses. Additionally, IFN-\u03b2 has been found to modulate the expression of antiviral microRNAs in response to RNA viruses, including hepatitis C (Pedersen et al., 2007). Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that type I IFN-induced antiviral miRNAs might play an important role in host defense against EVs in the CNS.",

EV and cardiovirus (such as TMEV) proteins may counter-act host defenses (Agol and Gmyl, 2010). The ability to evade the host antiviral response may be an important contributing factor not only for maximizing acute infection, but also for the successful establishment of viral persistence. PV, rhinovirus (RV), and EV have been found to reduce RIG-I levels and disrupt RIG-I mediated interferon signaling (Barral et al., 2009). A reduction in RIG-I levels has been attributed to the activity of the PV 3C protease. PV and RV type-1a have also been observed to cleave MDA5 through a caspase and proteasome-dependent mechanism (Barral et al., 2007). Since RIG-I signaling induces further RIG-I expression, and MDA5 provides secondary protection against viral infection in the host cell, EVs may also target the downstream signaling pathways for these molecules. The 3C protease of EV-71 has also been found to disrupt RIG-I signaling through a protease-independent fashion. Instead of cleaving, 3C protease binds to RIG-I and prevents the recruitment of IPS-1 (Lei et al., 2010). In contrast, RV-14 attenuates the type I interferon response by targeting the activation of IRF-3 upon identification by MDA5 (Kotla et al., 2008). Similarly, TMEV has been found to inhibit IRF-3 dimerization (Ricour et al., 2009).",

By altering the nucleus by degrading nuclear pore complex proteins, viruses can affect host mRNA and protein localization, and shut down host protective factors. The hyperphosphorylation of Nup98 by the L protein during TMEV infection has been shown to block host mRNA export from the nucleus (Ricour et al., 2009). Herpesvirus genomes have been found to encode miRNAs suggesting that they exploit the host miRNA machinery to regulate the expression of host and viral genes (Pfeffer et al., 2005). Although this mechanism has not been demonstrated for EVs, Pelletier et al. have found that cells exposed to and cured of PV using RNAi respond more quickly to RNAi treatment, as compared to cells never having been exposed to PV (Pelletier et al., 2010). These intriguing results suggest that cellular miRNA processing machinery plays an antiviral role during EV infections, as well.

The significant contribution of a neutralizing antibody response in controlling infection is also shown by studies describing individuals suffering from agammaglobulimia. The absence of neutralizing antibodies in agammaglobulimic patients results in an increased susceptibility to EV infections of the CNS that can lead to chronic neuropathies (Misbah et al., 1992). Experiments evaluating CVB3 infection in mice lacking B cells (BcKO mice) indicate that antibodies are critical for viral clearance (Mena et al., 1999). The role of B cells in controlling CVB3 infection may be more complex by evidence suggesting B cells may contribute to virus dissemination via the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d hypothesis. Early after infection in normal mice, high levels of viral RNA was observed in proliferating lymphocytes located within the marginal zone of the spleen.",

A highly detailed and informative review on TMEV-induced molecular mimicry model of multiple sclerosis has been published (Olson et al., 2005). Infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes within the CNS has also been shown following EV infection (Lin et al., 2009b). Exacerbation of virally-induced morbidity may occur in mice deficient in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, indicating that T cells are necessary to combat infection. In contrast, some EVs such as CVB3, have evolved ways to escape detection by CD8+ T cells via the inhibition of antigen presentation by the MHC class I pathway (Kemball et al., 2009). Therefore, activation of the T cell response may vary greatly, depending upon the EV genus (Slifka et al., 2001).",

EV persistence appears to be the product of the ongoing attempt of the host to eliminate or suppress virus replication, and the virus' struggle to remain intact in a hostile cellular environment. Under the selective pressures generated by a successful host immune response, sometimes the best defense for the virus is simply to mutate. As described above, errors in EV replication can lead to the existence of viral quasispecies (Domingo et al., 2008) which may broaden the tropism of EV (Vignuzzi et al., 2006), assist in evasion from the immune response, and lead to persistence.

In the case of TMEV, virus has been found to persist in oligodendrocyte cell cultures, but the main reservoir for persistent TMEV may be macrophages (Roussarie et al., 2007).

Indeed PV RNA could be detected in some patients with PPS, though the persistent virus may be very different from the wild type strain (Baj et al., 2007). The low viral load and the unclear mechanism of reactivation for mutated virus in PPS patients most likely fuel the controversy regarding the potential contribution of persistent PV material to recurring disease. Perhaps PV persists in an attenuated form in peripheral nervous tissues of the host at low replication rates; a reactivation event, such as injury, might trigger higher levels of viral replication with ensuing neurological sequelae. Injury-mediated retrograde axonal transport of PV has been demonstrated to carry PV into the CNS (Gromeier and Wimmer, 1998), and may be a mechanism by which PV can be transported from sites of persistence back to the CNS.",

            "text": "CV persistence in the heart has been the subject of much investigation, and its persistence in the CNS has only recently been described (Feuer et al., 2009). In the heart, CV persistence is associated with chronic myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy (Chapman and Kim, 2008). The host innate immune response, in particular the type I IFN response, is extremely critical for controlling CV infection of the heart (Deonarain et al., 2004). The type I IFN response might also create selective pressures resulting in viral genome mutations (Kim et al., 2005b), attenuation of CV, and persistence in the heart. Genome deletions in the 5\u2032 UTR of CVB3 were recently observed upon passage of CVB3 in primary heart cell cultures. These deletions were associated with a reduction in cytopathic effects (cpe) without reductions in viral titers (Kim et al., 2008). Similarly, persistent CVB3 RNA was detected in the CNS of mice following neonatal infection for up to 90 days post-infection (PI), as determined by nested RT-PCR, in the absence of infectious virus by plaque assay (Feuer et al., 2009). Our most recent results suggest that CVB3-infected neurospheres, or NPSCs grown in culture as free-floating structures, may support a persistent or carrier-state infection (manuscript submitted). Based on these results, we hypothesize that neurogenic regions of the CNS may be potential sites of CVB3 persistence in vivo. Perhaps CVB3 reactivation is induced upon occasional proliferation and asymmetric division of resting or quiescent type B neural stem cells harboring persistent virus within the CNS (Fig. 3), thereby leading to intermittent replication of virus.",

The GreeneChip pioneered by Ian Lipkin represents the technological forefront of pathogen identification, but has yet to be employed in the context of EV infections of the CNS (Hunter, 2008). Diagnosis via selective culture using transgenic cell lines is limited and hindered primarily by the absence of cell lines supporting strain-specific replication (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007). In contrast, molecular techniques, such as RT-PCR, represent a sensitive and precise methodology for identification of EV CNS infection. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from afflicted patients is the preferred source of clinical sample upon which these techniques can be performed. Genomic analysis using RT-PCR can be completed within 24 h of sample collection (Romero, 1999). RT-PCR diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis has been performed using primers recognizing a conserved region within the 5\u2032 UTR (Rotbart, 1990). While genus level identification of EVs is clinically relevant and can be used to guide antiviral regimes, strain-specific genotyping is required in some instances. RT-PCR characterization of the VP1 region has lead to strain-specific phylogenetic classification (Mirand et al., 2008). Sequencing of the VP4 and VP2 regions was performed in instances where molecular typing using the VP1 region was inconclusive. These studies indicate that RT-PCR is an effective and clinically feasible technique for the identification of the specific EV strain present in clinically obtained CSF samples.",

TUNEL staining showed colocalization of infection and apoptosis within the CNS following IC inoculation of our neonatal mouse model with a recombinant CVB3 expressing eGFP (eGFP-CVB3). A direct overlap of infection and activated caspase-3 protein revealed infected cells undergoing early stage apoptosis. Also, infection of virally-infected neuronal precursor cells contributed to the generation of lesions within the CNS. We also recently revealed the induction of apoptosis in the choroid plexus (Tabor-Godwin et al., 2010) following CVB3 infection. These results suggest that EV may compromise the function of the choroid plexus, an essential organ involved in CSF production and immune regulation. The observation of hydrocephalus in mice following CVB3 infection may be related to choroid plexus dysfunction following infection. Reports also indicate that PV infection may be associated with induction of apoptosis in the CNS (Girard et al., 1999). DNA oligonucleosomal laddering and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays performed upon CNS samples obtained from mice exhibiting paralytic poliomyelitis indicated the presence of cells undergoing apoptosis. These studies indicate that EVs are capable of inducing apoptosis within the CNS.",

Previous studies have suggested a link between EV infection early in childhood and the development of schizophrenia (Rantakallio et al., 1997, Suvisaari et al., 2003). EV infection of the CNS occurring during childhood is also associated with long term neuropathies including delayed neurodevelopment and reduced cognition (Chang et al., 2007). Clinical examination of placental samples from newborns exhibiting neurodevelopmental defects has revealed the presence of EV within the tissue (Euscher et al., 2001). EV-71 has specifically been implicated as the causative agent of developmental defects in the CNS (Huang et al., 2006). Infection of pregnant mice with polyinosinic\u2013polycytidylic acid, a compound that mimics replicating virus, may lead to inhibition of embryonic neuronal stem cell development (De et al., 2010). Therefore, developmental defects observed following EV infection of the CNS might be attributed, at least in part, to the abrogation of normal stem cell replication within the brain.",

PV escape variants against siRNAs evolve to incorporate a single nucleotide mutation located in the center of the targeted RNA (Gitlin et al., 2002). One strategy to combat this phenomenon may be the simultaneous administration of multiple siRNAs. The administration of a cocktail consisting of three distinct siRNAs may reduce the number of escape mutant progeny to extremely low levels (Merl and Wessely, 2007). Targeting receptors of viral entry with RNAi may be another strategy of effectively inhibiting EV replication. siRNAs directed against murine CAR (mCAR) decreased CVB3 titers in mice (Werk et al., 2005).

EV infections of the CNS rarely occur in the absence of infection of peripheral tissues outside the brain. Therefore, even if a therapeutic agent has not been demonstrated to hinder virus production within the CNS per se; by inhibiting replication in other tissues, an siRNA-based drug might impede virus growth and the eventual progression of disease into the CNS.

Currently under clinical development as a broad-spectrum antiviral, ribavirin has been shown to inhibit the replication of a variety of EVs. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, may act as a mutagen via incorporation into the viral RNA genome (Crotty and Andino, 2002, Crotty et al., 2000, Crotty et al., 2001). The presence of ribavirin may force the afflicted virus into \u201cError catastrophe\u201d by generating a highly variable noninfectious quasispecies swarm and thereby causing lethal mutagenesis (Vignuzzi et al., 2006). Ribavirin has been found to inhibit both in vitro and in vivo EV-71 replication (Li et al., 2008). Human neuronal and mouse neuronal cell lines treated with ribavirin showed decreased signs of cpe following EV-71 infection. Also, ribavirin-treated mice exhibited decreased mortality, morbidity, and paralysis rates when challenged with EV-71 (Li et al., 2008).",

Upon treatment of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a neurological disease caused by persistent measles infection, only direct intracranial (IC) and not IP administration of RBV diminished the effects of this virus (Honda et al., 1994). Combining the drug with the lipophylic carrier molecule, cyclodextrin, may increase the concentration within the CNS following IP injection (Jeulin et al., 2009). Ribavirin has also been combined with IFN-\u03b1 therapy to treat SSPE (Hosoya et al., 2001). Patients received intravenous (IV) ribavirin, as well as intraventricular IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Upon treatment with ribavirin (20 mg/kg), high performance liquid chromatography quantification indicated that the compound was present within the cerebral spinal fluid of one patient at a concentration of 7.5 \u03bcg/ml, a concentration shown to inhibit the replication of SSPE in both tissue culture and mouse studies (Hosoya et al., 1989, Ishii et al., 1996). Therefore, ribavirin may be capable of crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) in sufficient quantities and to inhibit viral replication. In our neonatal model of CVB3 infection, IP administration of ribavirin led to brain wet weight recovery (manuscript in preparation) indicating that the compound may cross the BBB in effective quantities to reduce CVB3 replication during persistent infection.",

Pleconaril is able to cross the BBB and remain within the CNS at concentrations that inhibit EV replication (Schmidtke et al., 2009). The mechanism of action for pleconaril against viral pathogens is two-fold; the compound inhibits both viral attachment to the cognate receptor and uncoating of the nucleocapsid during replication (Chen et al., 2008b). Pleconaril inhibits viral attachment by binding to the VP1 protein present in the canyon floor or \u2018pocket\u2019 of the nucleocapsid and inducing a conformational change in the protein. This conformational change synergistically inhibits the release of the viral RNA from the nucleocapsid, effectively hindering replication. Tissue culture and animal challenge studies testing the susceptibility of clinical EV isolates to the drug have demonstrated antiviral activity (Pevear et al., 1999). Also, numerous case studies evaluating the efficacy of pleconaril to treat clinically ill patients including immunocompromised individuals have been described (Desmond et al., 2006, Webster, 2005). A previous study has suggested that the Nancy strain of CVB3 may be resistant to pleconaril (Schmidtke et al., 2005). This resistance was found to be due to a point mutation at amino acid 1092 of the CVB3 open reading frame. Resistance was associated with a leucine at this position, whereas isoleucine and valine were associated with susceptibility to pleconaril. In summation, these studies demonstrate that pleconaril may be a valuable compound in the treatment of some EV infections of the CNS.",

Many effective vaccines stimulating both the innate and adaptive immune response have been designed to combat the remaining clinically relevant EVs. To combat EV infection, the adaptive immune response employs both T cells and antibodies in the clearance of the virus. Therefore, the most successful vaccines activate both humoral and cell-mediated immunity and induce lasting viral immunity. The administration of novel vaccines to patients comes with potential risks, extensive and costly clinical studies, and a potentially apprehensive public. Unfortunately, acceptance of EV-based vaccines to the public may not materialize unless the potential diseases caused by these pathogens become much more widely appreciated. That said, ongoing EV vaccine studies may help us improve the efficacy and safety of potential vaccine candidates, especially if EV transmission and/or disease manifestations increase in the general population in the future. Also \u201ctherapeutic vaccines\u201d, those vaccines given after initial infection, might be more readily accepted in patients suffering from EV-mediated disease. \u201cTherapeutic vaccines\u201d could be envisioned which may enhance or redirect an ongoing immune response in order to reduce viral load during early infection, or after the establishment of viral persistence.",

Another mutation that can cause CNS attenuation is located between the 5\u2032 NTR cloverleaf and IRES and reduces the binding of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (Guest et al., 2004). Other studies have made recombinant viruses that use the IRES from human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2) to attenuate neurovirulence in the Sabin vaccine strain of PV as well as in herpes simplex virus type 1 (Campbell et al., 2007, Gromeier et al., 1996).

The original formalin-inactivated form of the vaccine (IPV) was developed by Jonas Salk and licensed in 1955 (Salk et al., 1954). In 1963, an orally administered live attenuated PV vaccine (OPV) was formulated (Sabin, 1957). The usage of these vaccines and optimized versions has severely reduced the incidence of poliomyelitis, although the pathogen has yet to be eradicated worldwide. Preference for the administration of the IPV over the OPV is due to the discovery of circulating vaccine-derived PVs (cVDPV) associated with the OPV. cVDPVs are virulent PVs derived from the OPV that occur in a small minority of vaccine recipients. The reversion of cVDPVs from attenuation to virulence is a direct consequence of the genetic instability of the vaccine. In 2000, cVDPVs were responsible for a polio outbreak in the Dominican Republic and Haiti (Olen Kew 2002). Sequencing determined that the cVDPVs were recombinant viruses. The derivation of neurovirulent polio strains from the OPV has led to the \u201cOPV paradox,\u201d which is based upon the idea that complete eradication of poliomyelitis is contingent upon the elimination of the attenuated form of the vaccine (Dowdle et al., 2003).",

A formaldehyde-inactivated whole virus preparation has been shown to protect mice from encephalomyelitis caused by EV-71 infection (Ong et al., 2010). Histopathological examination using EV-71 specific antibodies revealed an absence of the virus within the brain stem of immunized mice. Plaque assays using brain stem and spinal cord homogenates confirmed the absence of infectious virus within these tissues. Using a unique strategy, transgenic mice were developed to secrete the VP1 capsid protein of EV-71 into milk secretions. When the milk from transgenic animals was fed to neonatal mice, these neonates developed serologically specific antibodies against EV-71 and did not exhibit weight loss when challenged with the virus (Chen et al., 2008a). Also, virus-like particles, which resemble EV-71 in capsid structure and protein composition, have been found to elicit a protective humoral antibody response in animals (Chung et al., 2008). In addition, passive immunization protected neonatal mice from EV-71 associated morbidity when confronted with a lethal dose of virus. A DNA vaccine coding for VP1 has also been developed (Wu et al., 2001). But in contrast to the aforementioned vaccines, the VP1-based vaccine was only partially protective, as shown by a 40% survival rate of mice inoculated with a lethal dose of EV-71 following vaccination.",

Progress has been made using a variety of vaccines strategies utilizing either DNA plasmids expressing viral proteins, inactivated virus, or live attenuated forms of virus. A safe and effective RNA vaccine against CVB3 that produces noninfectious virus has been recently produced (Hunziker et al., 2004). Genomic mutation via PCR mutagenesis of the 3CDpro cleavage site present between CVB3 proteins 2A and 2B resulted in an RNA viral genome incapable of producing infectious virions, yet conferring partial protective immunity. RNA-immunized mice exhibited lower viral titers within the pancreas and prolonged survival when challenged with CVB3. RNA-based vaccines are advantageous as compared to DNA vaccines due to their inability to integrate into host DNA.",

Two independent plasmids encoded the VP1 and VP3 capsid epitopes induced the production of virally specific antibodies following in vivo electroporation (Park et al., 2009). Although vaccinated mice displayed a reduction in virally induced heart injury, the induced antibodies failed to neutralize infectious CVB3 in culture.

Another original approach to vaccine design involved encoding a mutant PV that contained hundreds to thousands of under-represented codon pairs in the PV non-structural proteins (Coleman et al., 2008). This codon-altered PV had the same amino-acid sequence as wild-type PV, yet suffered from a decrease in the virus protein translation rate. Thus, the codon-altered PV could illicit a protective immune response despite its attenuation (Wimmer et al., 2009). Both of these approaches greatly decreased the ability of the attenuated \u201cvaccine strain\u201d to revert to wild-type PV.

Also, recombinant PVs designed by the Gromeier laboratory may be of clinical use for viral gene delivery into the CNS, or as oncolytic viruses to target glioblastoma cells and other tumorigenic cells (Goetz et al., 2010). Attenuated CV may also represent an attractive option; our laboratory and others have shown the feasibility of generating relatively stable recombinant CVs expressing such gene products as GFP, dsRED, and renilla luciferase (Feuer et al., 2005, Kim et al., 2009). Also with their particular stem cell tropism in mind, attenuated recombinant CVB3 may be of value as a viral gene vector specifically for delivery of stem cell modulators, such as transcription factors inducing differentiation, into neural and embryonic stem cells.

EVs are among the most common and medically important human pathogens, are a frequent cause of CNS disease (Muir and van Loon, 1997), and may preferentially cause harm in the very young. Much remains to be learned regarding factors influencing EV tropism, activation of the immune response following infection, infiltration of immune cells into the CNS to combat infection, mechanism of pathogenesis, and antiviral/vaccine development (Nathanson, 2008). The large number of EV strains circulating in nature hinders the promise of successful vaccine design against these viruses. The potential cessation of the globally administered PV vaccine, either due to the successful eradication of poliomyelitis, or due to dwindling World Health Organization resources, may lead to emergence of uncharacterized CVs and other related non-polio EVs previously restrained by cross-reacting antibodies generated through yearly immunizations. These uncharacterized, yet circulating EV strains with potential CNS tropism might constitute a new impediment in our control over a devious viral pathogen. Finally, the ability of EVs to persist in the CNS and target neural stem cells might suggest lasting effects on brain function. Future studies might be directed at inspecting possible behavioral alterations and memory dysfunction following recovery from these challenging, yet successful neurotropic viruses.",

Pleconaril, ribavirin, intra-venous immunoglobulins (IVIg) and RNAi each inhibit the production of infectious virions at different steps. Pleconaril induces a conformational change in the viral VP1 capsid protein that inhibits both genome uncoating and the binding of the virus to its cognate receptor, CAR. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, is incorporated into the viral genome. This incorporation results in viral genomic mutations that lead to \u201cerror catastrophe\u201d. Virus-specific IVIg may bind to virions extracellularly and inhibit the virus from entering the cell. RNAi molecules target the positive sense viral RNA strand leading to Dicer-mediated degradation of the viral genome. However, escape mutants may form that avoid the effects of RNAi. Positive-sense strand viral RNA is shown in black; negative sense strand viral RNA is shown in green. Antiviral compounds are shown in red. The replication complex is shown in blue.",
