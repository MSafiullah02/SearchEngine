The degree of wetting, or wettability, is determined by the balance of adhesive forces on the surface (free surface energy) and cohesive forces within the wetting phase (surface tension). The wetting phase will tend to spread on the solid surface, and a porous solid will tend to imbibe the wetting phase. In the case of immunoassays, it is important that the channels along which fluids pass have a high wettability for aqueous solutions. Wettability is determined by measuring the contact angle of a drop of the aqueous solution on the solid, which may be plastic, glass, or metal.",

Water molecules are attracted by hydrophilic surfaces on the inside of such media, causing the leading edge of a narrow tube of water to move along, even against the force of gravity. Capillary action occurs when the adhesion to the walls is stronger than the cohesive forces between the water molecules. The same attraction between water molecules that is responsible for surface tension causes the leading water molecules to pull the neighboring water molecules along behind them. Capillary forces are exerted at the contact perimeter of liquid and channel walls and therefore scale favorably with miniaturization. This is due to the perimeter becoming larger relative to the channel cross-sectional area upon downscaling. During capillary filling of microchannels, the meniscus proceeds with the square root of time based on the linearly increasing flow resistance of the filled channel segment, as described by the Lucas\u2013Washburn equation (Delamarche et al., 2005). However, this slowdown of passive filling in constant cross-section channels can be overcome by tailoring the device geometry and/or the surface hydrophobicity, effectively yielding \u201cprogrammable\u201d passive microfluidic circuits.",

EOF is based on the formation of ion layers on charged surfaces, for instance microchannels on glass, silicon, or plasma-treated plastic substrates. Here, sample constituents form static and mobile layers of counter ions on the charged surface. When an electric field is applied along the channel, the mobile counter ion layer will migrate toward the oppositely charged electrode. For microscale systems this will generate a bulk flow of liquid in the channel. EOF is convenient for manipulating fluid around a microchip via electric fields but does require charged surfaces, which are more difficult to obtain on injection molded plastic microfluidics.",

Unless the sample is excessively diluted by the assay reagents, the volume does not directly affect the chance of antigen and antibody coming into contact.

In solid-phase assays, one of the key reactants is immobilized. This reduces the speed with which the assay progresses as only the reactant in the liquid phase can freely move about. The use of very small volumes with associated shortened diffusion times in microscale assays therefore increases the reaction rate and decreases the time required to equilibrium, resulting in overall reduced analysis times.",

Electrokinetic separation assays can be further differentiated into the following categories: (i) affinity preparative: affinity-based binding occurring before or during separation, (ii) pre-equilibrated affinity assays\n: affinity reagents and sample mixed to equilibrium before chip-based separation, and (iii) on-chip equilibrated affinity assays: affinity reagents and sample mixed dynamically in a separation channel. The affinity preparative approach can be used for immunoenrichment or immunodepletion (Breadmore, 2007). This can help to lower the detection limits and widen the dynamic range of immunodiagnostic assays, in particular when performed in complex clinical samples (Mondal and Gupta, 2006). LOC-based microfluidic systems are well suited for on-chip equilibrated affinity assays, as multiple steps can be integrated onto a single chip, with parallel processing as an added option. The simultaneous determination of four hormones in blood, saliva, and urine after immunoextraction, labeling, electro-elution, and 2min electrophoretic separation has already been demonstrated (Wellner and Kalish, 2008). The immunoaffinity sample preparation has even allowed the analysis of skin biopsy samples for 12 inflammation markers, again with electrophoretic separation of all markers bound to a fluorescently labeled detection antibody (Phillips and Wellner, 2007). Other electrokinetic separation-based microfluidic immunodiagnostic systems include a device for measuring anti-inflammation drugs in plasma (Phillips and Wellner, 2006), a four channel system for monitoring insulin islet secretion (Dishinger and Kennedy, 2007), and a device for simultaneous quantification of four cancer markers in serum after a 50s electrophoretic separation (Yang et al., 2010).",

Micronics Inc., Redmond, WA, USA has developed a competitive homogeneous immunoassay in a T-sensor fabricated on a glass-Mylar-glass hybrid chip that comprises two fluid inlets that lead to two channels that merge into a single 100\u00b5m-deep \u00d7 1200\u00b5m-wide channel that connects to a fluid outlet (Kamholz et al., 1999, Hatch et al., 2001). Under laminar flow conditions, the two fluid streams (the antibody reagent and the sample spiked with fluorescein-labeled antigen) flow side-by-side, and the only mixing is by diffusion. Diffusion of antigen into the parallel stream is governed by the fraction that binds to antibody in the parallel flowing stream. Competition between sample antigen and labeled antigen for binding sites in the antibody stream provides the basis for antigen quantitation. An advantage of this assay is that diluted whole blood can be assayed without the need to remove red cells. An assay for phenytoin in whole blood (10- to 400-fold dilution) required less than 1 min and detected 0.43nM phenytoin (Hatch et al., 2001).",

The ideal antibody would be monoclonal and have very high affinity. Such antibodies are possible using phage display to generate high affinity antibodies (typically K\neq is 107\u2013109) from a large phage display library, followed by selective modification of the amino acid sequences of the complementarity determining regions using a sequencer to generate new phage DNA sequences.

Rather than using single dye molecules, beads carrying a large number of dye molecules are preferred, as they yield a stronger fluorescent emission. Recently, fluorescent beads with a large Stokes shift between excitation and emission light have become available that facilitate spectral filtration in integrated disposable immunodiagnostics devices. As an example, TransFluoSpheres\u2122, which comprise a cascade of dyes in a polystyrene bead matrix and generate Stokes shifts of up to 200 nm, are particularly useful and have been applied to immunodiagnostic chips with integrated head-on fluorescence detection (Ryu et al., 2011).",

Multichannel microfluidic immunoassays with simultaneous readout based on a scanning fluorescence detection system have also been developed (Cheng et al., 2001). More recently, an integrated portable LIF detection device for oral immunodiagnostics has been demonstrated, yielding nanomolar to picomolar sensitivity for saliva-based periodontal disease markers (Herr et al., 2007).

A compact integrated LIF immunodiagnostic system with picomolar sensitivities for a panel of biological toxins has been developed by Sandia National Laboratories (Meagher et al., 2008). The system is based on integrated electronics and miniaturized optics comprising diode lasers, mirrors, lenses, filters, and a photomultiplier tube (PMT). As a first step toward potentially fully disposable fluorescence detection systems, Ryu and coworkers have developed an integrated immunodiagnostic detection system based on inorganic LEDs and organic photodiodes with nanograms per milliliter sensitivities reported for cardiac markers myoglobin and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) isoenzyme (Ryu et al., 2011).",

In early work on a model mouse IgG immunoassay, HRP-labeled conjugate was detected on a capillary electrophoresis microchip using standard luminol/peroxide chemistry (Mangru and Harrison, 1998). An aluminum mirror fabricated onto the back side of the detection zone provided a reflective surface to enhance collection efficiency of the emitted light, yielding a linear range for mouse IgG of 0\u201360 \u00b5g/mL. More recently, chemiluminescence detection has been extended to a 10-channel capillary flow-through sandwich immunoassay for biological agent detection (Yacoub-George et al., 2007). Here, microperistaltic pumps were used to drive fluid in 10 parallel microchip mounted capillaries with HRP-based chemiluminescence detection on a multianode-photomultiplier array. A magnetic bead-based immunoassay for C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum has been demonstrated on a microchip with integrated pneumatically driven micropumps, microvalves, and micromixers (Yang et al., 2009). Chemiluminescence detection was based on an acridium ester label on the detection antibody and off-chip luminometer-based readout, yielding a detection limit of 0.0125 mg/L for CRP. A 0.1mg/L detection limit for an indirect CRP immunoassay has been demonstrated in serum on a multichannel injection molded cyclic olefin chip using HRP/luminol-based chemiluminescence generation and benchtop imaging system readout (Bhattacharyya and Klapperich, 2007). More interestingly, an onboard instant film module has also been tested which, when compared against reference films, could potentially be exploited in a qualitative POC setting. A magnetic bead-based immunoassay for insulin and interleukin-6 on a digital microfluidic platform has been demonstrated by Pamula and coworkers (Sista et al., 2008b). Here, HRP labels were reacted with PS-Atto substrate and read out on a PMT.",

In early work, TLM has been effectively applied to an immunometric immunoassay for determination of human secretory immunoglobulin A and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (Sato et al., 2000, Sato et al., 2001). Using capture antibody-coated polystyrene beads confined in a 100\u00b5m-deep \u00d7 250\u00b5m-wide glass channel, a 0.03ng/mL detection limit for CEA was achieved after 10min incubation. More recently, Kitamori and coworkers have applied high-sensitivity TLM detection to a microchip-based open-sandwich ELISA for human osteocalcin in serum (Ihara et al., 2010). Using a 658nm excitation, 785nm probe beam, and a photodiode detector, a sensitivity of 1.0 \u00b5g/L could be demonstrated for osteocalcin, equivalent to plate-based ELISA results.",

In more recent work, Lee and coworkers have demonstrated label-free determination of adenine on a polysilicon-coated glass wafer (Cho et al., 2009).

Notably, the SPR-based Biacore\u2122 system has found widespread use as a commercial immunoassay development platform (see Commercial Microfluidic Immunodiagnostics). Here, we only describe applications of SPR to microfluidics-based immunodiagnostic devices. In early work, SPR has been used in conjunction with a microfluidic unit in contact with a sensor surface to measure the kinetics of monoclonal antibody\u2013antigen reactions in real time. The antibody or antigen was immobilized in a dextran matrix that was attached to the sensor surface and binding events monitored by SPR (Karlsson et al., 1991). Over the last 20  years, this highly sensitive and reliable method for low molecular weight analyte determination in complex analytical matrices has seen considerable improvements, particularly in terms of more robust sensing surfaces and more compact instrumentation (Shankaran et al., 2007, Shankaran and Miura, 2007). Lee and coworkers have demonstrated automatic PDMS microchips with micropumps and valves for immunoassay arrays with two-dimensional SPR phase imaging detection based on the Kretschmann configuration (Lee et al., 2007b). To account for the temperature sensitivity of SPR measurements, a temperature control module comprising micro-heaters and temperature sensors was also incorporated, resulting in a preliminary detection limit for IgG of 0.67nM. As an important step toward POC applications, Davis and coworkers have developed a fully self-contained hand-held SPR device powered by a 9V battery (Feltis et al., 2008). To demonstrate efficacy of the system, 200ng/mL ricin has been detected in a plastic cylindrical sensor cell via an immobilized anti-ricin antibody immunoassay within 10min Similarly Yager and coworkers have built a compact SPR imaging (SPRi) instrument based on a diode light source, image detector, integrated digital signal processor, and passive temperature control (Chinowsky et al., 2007). Proof of concept was demonstrated with a competition immunoassay for phenytoin.",

More recently, Bakker and coworkers have demonstrated potentiometric detection in nanoparticle-based sandwich immunoassays (Chumbimuni-Torres et al., 2006). Following the catalytic deposition of silver on gold nanoparticle labels on the detection antibody, silver dissolution is potentiometrically detected using an Ag+-selective electrode, yielding a detection limit of 12.5 pmol IgG in 50 \u00b5L of sample. On-chip amperometric detection of an alkaline phosphatase label has been accomplished following separation of free antibody and antibody\u2013antigen complex in a post-column reaction of the enzyme label with a 4-aminophenyl phosphate substrate and downstream amperometric detection of the 4-aminophenol product (Wang et al., 2001). A detection limit of 1.7 amol was achieved in a model assay for mouse IgG conducted in 50\u03bcm-deep \u00d7 20\u03bcm-wide channels in a glass microchip. A bead-based microfluidic immunoassay for urinary hippuric acid determination in the range of 0\u201340 mg/mL has been demonstrated on a PDMS microchip with enzymatically amplified amperometric detection (Yoo et al., 2009). Whitesides and coworkers have demonstrated chronoamperometric analysis of glucose and square wave anodic stripping voltammetry measurements of heavy metal ions on microfluidic paper-based electrochemical devices (mPEDs) (Nie et al., 2010). The simple low-cost device comprising two printed carbon electrodes as the working and counter electrodes, and a printed Ag/AgCl electrode as the pseudo-reference electrode is inherently compatible with immunoassay-based analysis. A conductometric immunometric (sandwich) immunoassay for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum has recently been demonstrated with nanogold labels on a microcomb-type electrode yielding a limit of detection of 0.01 ng/mL (Liu et al., 2009).

Tothill and coworkers have applied this approach to the determination of cancer markers in 75% human serum, with a detection limit of 0.29 ng/mL, for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (Uludag and Tothill, 2010). The main drawback for POC immunodiagnostic applications is QCM\u2019s sensitivity to matrix viscosity, which necessitates the use of on-chip controls. In the cantilever approach, the surface stress generated by antigen\u2013antibody molecule recognition is measured (Hwang et al., 2009, Waggoner and Craighead, 2007). In early proof of concept work, the detection of CK and myoglobin has been demonstrated at <20 \u00b5g/mL (Arntz et al., 2003). Cho and coworkers have shown the detection of urinary PSA at picomolar concentration levels (Cho et al., 2005).

Typically, positive pressure to the microchip inlet is used to induce filling of the microfluidic circuit, with high precision syringe pumps most commonly used. Variants include the use of integrated micropumps or the application of vacuum to the microchip outlet. Electroosmotic flow on charged glass or silicon surfaces can also be exploited but requires the use of high-voltage power supplies. The above microchip flow control approaches all require support instrumentation, thereby limiting POC employment capabilities. To overcome current limitations, extensive research has been directed toward alternative flow control means (West et al., 2008, Arora et al., 2010), including CD-based systems (Ducree et al., 2007), digital microfluidics (Jebrail and Wheeler, 2010), and passive capillarity-based systems (Eijkel and van den Berg, 2006), and their application to immunodiagnostic POC testing (Gervais et al., 2011b). In the following sections, these more recent flow control approaches will be introduced, and the current technical status reviewed, with particular emphasis on their suitability for POC immunodiagnostic testing.",

This can be exploited to dispense, move, merge, mix, and split droplets, which are often suspended in immiscible oil to prevent evaporation and cross-contamination, and to limit NSB to channel surfaces. Open one-plate configurations can be used with droplets manipulated on a single substrate housing both driving and ground electrodes. For POC immunodiagnostic applications, however, enclosed two-plate systems are most commonly employed to facilitate device handling and limit fluid evaporation. While compatibility of digital microfluidics with physiological fluids, including whole blood, was first demonstrated by Srinivasan in 2004 (Srinivasan et al., 2004), immunodiagnostic applications have only recently emerged.

It is based on silicon capillary systems (CSs) that fill predominantly by capillary force. The integrated microfluidic systems comprise a filling port, a microchannel, and a passive \u201ccapillary pump\u201d outlet. The \u201ccapillary pump\u201d outlet comprises branching channels to increase surface area and promote fluid evaporation, which assists capillarity-based filling. Interactive flow control is afforded by controlling evaporation rates through Peltier element-based cooling. Bio-functionalization for immunoassays is performed on a separate PDMS substrate attached to the CS. The group has already demonstrated the detection of cytokine TNF\u03b1 with picomolar sensitivity in sub-microliter volumes (Cesaro-Tadic et al., 2004). Early work was based on serial manual pipetting of analyte and detection antibody into the inlet port. The group has subsequently focused on the implementation of an autonomous one-step immunodiagnostic format. With this process, the detection of 1ng/mL CRP in 5\u00b5L of serum has been demonstrated within 5min on a passive device comprising a sample collector, delay valves, flow resistors, reaction chambers, and CSs (Gervais and Delamarche, 2009, Zimmermann et al., 2009). A more versatile six-channel one-step immunoassay platform has recently been developed, which allows the adjustment and optimization of sample flow rate, sample volumes, and detection antibody concentration (Gervais et al., 2011c). As has been independently shown by other groups for pumped systems (Parsa et al., 2008), sample flow rate and the concentration and distribution of the detection antibody are critically important for achieving adequate sensitivity in on-chip immunoassays. For the passive CS platform, the reagent release has thus been optimized via controllable reagent integrators that enable programmable reagent pickup in one-step immunodiagnostic chips (Hitzbleck et al., 2011).",

As outlined above, microchip-based microfluidics can offer a variety of sophisticated solutions to POC immunodiagnostics but not necessarily at low cost or without ancillary equipment. On the other hand, lateral flow-based devices are easy to use, low cost, and stand-alone but lack precise quantification capabilities.

Proof of concept was demonstrated through the simultaneous color-change-based detection of glucose and protein in urine (Martinez et al., 2007). This photolithographic patterning approach has since been refined into a rapid prototyping method that is compatible with printed masks (Martinez et al., 2008c). Enhanced functionality was demonstrated through vertically stacked paper layers to enable sample distribution over arrays of reagent spots for multi-analyte assays (Martinez et al., 2008b) and a programmable 3D system to enable application-specific reconfiguration (Martinez et al., 2010a). While the above systems still require serial manual application of reagents, Yager\u2019s group has developed a paper-based system for automated multi-reagent delivery based on dissolvable trehalose barriers (Fu et al., 2010). More importantly, in the context of this discussion, a 96-zone paper plate has recently been demonstrated for ELISA-based HIV detection in serum (Cheng et al., 2010). In this work, human anti-HIV-1 antibodies were captured by immobilized HIV-1 antigen, with a secondary goat anti-human IgG with alkaline phosphatase label introduced for colorimetric detection with a desktop scanner. In addition to this reflectance-based colorimetric detection, other techniques used have included absorbance and fluorescence-based (Carrilho et al., 2009), and electrochemical (Dungchai et al., 2009) detection, which have been implemented with paper-based systems (Martinez et al., 2010b).

For instance, Linder and coworkers have developed a method to store a series of liquid reagent plugs in conventional polyethylene tubing, as needed for ELISA-based testing (Linder et al., 2005). To run the assay, the tubes were simply attached to the microchip inlet with a vacuum applied to the outlet, drawing in the reagent plugs one-by-one. Applying this approach to a PDMS microchip attached to a polystyrene substrate, HIV diagnosis in serum has been demonstrated within 13 min at nanomolar sensitivity with fluorescence microscope-based detection. While these reagents are stable during room temperature storage and transportation, efforts are underway to prove efficacy of this approach in field trials in the developing world (Chin et al., 2011). A dry reagent storage format for both the detection and capture antibody in a flow-through immunoassay system has been developed by Yager and coworkers for use in the developing world (Stevens et al., 2008). Dry reagent pads on polyester (detection antibody) and nitrocellulose (capture antibody) were prepared off-chip and inserted during assembly of the assay card comprising multiple layers of Mylar and PMMA. Using external syringe pumps to drive fluids, a robust malaria assay in serum has been demonstrated in 9 min with sub-nanomolar sensitivity on a flatbed scanner.",

Making the important transition to a readout compatible with low-resource settings, Whitesides and coworkers explored a telemedicine approach based on the use of widely available camera phones (Martinez et al., 2008a). Here, camera phones were used to digitize the output of colorimetric on-chip assays and for transferring digital information for off-site analysis by trained medical professionals. While this approach is very suitable for remote settings, technical difficulties remain with varying image intensities dependent on the camera phone and ambient conditions.

Over the last decade, a variety of different formats have been devised and have been extensively reviewed in the scientific literature (Hall et al., 2007, Simpson, 2003, Pollard et al., 2007, Hartmann et al., 2009a, Hartmann et al., 2009b, Yu et al., 2010). Arrays are typically classified into two types: forward-phase protein microarrays (FPPMs, subdivided into analytical antibody arrays and functional protein arrays) and reverse-phase protein microarrays (RPPMs).

Standard detection methods include fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and colorimetry. Such microarrays are typically used for profiling a complex mixture of proteins to measure binding affinities, specificities, and protein expression levels within a single sample. Antibody microarrays are the most common form of analytical microarray (Bertone and Snyder, 2005). While the technique is effective for well-characterized proteins for which good quality antibodies are available, this is often not the case. Avoiding the need for matched pairs of antibodies to each protein of interest, an alternative format simply labels all of the proteins in the sample with, e.g., a fluorescent tag, before incubating with the capture antibodies, an approach that has the advantage of allowing the direct comparison of two samples (e.g., Srivastava et al., 2006). One drawback of this method is that it is often difficult to label the low-abundance proteins with high efficiency, and it also suffers from reduced specificity through using a single antibody where cross-reactivity may be a problem.",

With equipment developed for DNA arrays being adaptable to protein microarrays, the selection of microscope slides as supports followed from the ready availability of robotic printers and laser scanners. Using a glass microscope slide as a supporting substrate, many different surfaces have been used including polyvinylidene fluoride (B\u00fcssow et al., 1998, Luecking et al., 1999), nitrocellulose, polystyrene (Holt et al., 2000), agarose (Afanassiev et al., 2000), PDMS (Zhu et al., 2000), and aldehyde-activated plain glass (MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000). These methods and others such as using a coating of poly-l-lysine or covalent attachment to the glass surface through silanes or epoxy derivatives, all generate a random orientation of the protein on the slide surface, which, in some cases, can adversely affect the proteins. Affinity tags can avoid such problems, providing a stable linkage in a reproducible orientation. Examples include the use of 6xHis tags on a nickel surface (Zhu et al., 2003), N-terminal GST tags and maltose-binding protein.",

Contact printers use metal pins to deposit nanoliter quantities of protein or antibody solution by directly contacting the slide, with pin dimensions determining the volume applied. Spotting by solid pins requires replenishment of the fluid for each application; using alternative quill pins with an internal reservoir filled by capillary action allows multiple applications from a single filling and the deposited volume is dependent on the contact time. Noncontact printers release a discrete amount of fluid through conventional ink-jet, piezoelectric pulsing, or electrospray deposition. These latter printers give more precise fluid delivery and hence improve spot-to-spot variation although they normally require a larger sample volume and can sometimes misplace spots (Hartmann et al., 2009a, Hartmann et al., 2009b).",

Microarrays with hundreds or thousands of deposited proteins are highly vulnerable to the degradation of each protein on an individual and uncontrolled basis. In contrast, nucleic acid-based arrays are extremely stable. Taking advantage of this, He and Taussig, 2001, He and Taussig, 2003 generated a protein in situ array (PISA)\u2014proteins were expressed directly from DNA and become attached to the array surface as they are made through recognition of a tag sequence or binding of histidine-tagged nascent proteins to the nickel-coated surface of a slide. Further improvements have been made by transcription and translation from an immobilized DNA template (rather than the solution used with PISA). The nucleic acid programmable protein array uses biotinylated cDNA plasmids encoding the proteins as GST fusions, printed onto an avidin-coated slide together with anti-GST antibody for protein capture (Ramachandran et al., 2004). The expressed proteins thus become immobilized in the same layout as the cDNA. In another advance devised by He and coworkers (He et al., 2008), protein expression is performed in a membrane held between two glass slides, one of which is arrayed with DNA and the other carries a reagent to capture the translated proteins. Tagged proteins are expressed in parallel and migrate to the second slide to be immobilized, forming the protein array as a mirror image of the DNA array. This approach has the advantages that the resulting array is free of the DNA itself and can be used repeatedly to generate copies of the array; at least 20 repeats have been reported.",

For the remainder, SPRi, carbon nanowires and nanotubes (CNTs), and interferometric and ellipsometric techniques have also attracted significant attention and offer both high sensitivity and a high level of multiplexing capability but are still presently at the research level.",

In both methods, proteins to be analyzed are co-crystallized on an array with UV absorbing compounds and vaporized by a pulsed-UV laser beam. The ionized protein fragments are then accelerated in an electric field and identified from the velocities, which are characterized by different mass/charge ratios. The two techniques differ in construction of the sample targets and analyzer design. These methods provide protein patterns for each sample and have been used extensively in the search for new biomarkers. Qualification and verification of candidate biomarkers have proved more of a challenge though and a further MS technique has emerged that offers significant potential for accelerating this process. In multiple reaction monitoring-MS (MRM-MS) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, parent peptide ions of target proteins selected by their mass/charge ratio are subjected to further collision-induced dissociation for monitoring of selected fragments. By using standards of synthetic, stable isotope-labeled versions of the signature proteotypic peptides in the sample (stable isotope dilution, SID-MRM-MS), it is possible to quantify the test and provide near-absolute structural specificity (Keshishian et al., 2007). A limitation of sensitivity of the method arising from sample complexity (serum) and the presence of high-abundance proteins can be overcome by incorporating immunocapture into the process: the SISCAPA\n\u00ae (stable isotope standards with capture by anti-peptide antibodies) method (Anderson et al., 2004) is effectively a conventional immunometric (sandwich) immunoassay, replacing the labeled antibody with an MS technique achieving a low nanograms per milliliter limit of quantitation and CVs <20%.",

Some examples of this very active area include studies on lung cancer (Gao et al., 2005) using an 84-antibody array to demonstrate discrimination between lung cancer patients and controls; breast cancer (Sebastiani et al., 2006) using 8 proteins on 149 carcinoma samples to evaluate survival correlations; breast cancer again (Sauer et al., 2008) using 54 proteins to identify a group of five that could be used to distinguish specific subgroups of patients; thyroid cancer (Linkov et al., 2008) where the plasma patterns of 19 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were used to identify five of these that could be used to discriminate between malignant and benign thyroid conditions; and bladder cancer (Sanchez-Carbayo et al., 2006) using an antibody array with 254 different antibodies to discriminate cancer patients from controls with a 94% classification rate. Many studies have been performed on patients with ovarian cancer, including studies on phospho-specific antibodies (Wulfkuhle et al., 2003); a 6-plex assay to screen patients with ovarian cancer that showed 95.3% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity within a population of 156 newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients and 362 healthy subjects (Visintin et al., 2008), and a study by Hudson et al. (2007) using a 5005 protein microarray to identify autoantibody sets capable of recognizing 94 antigens in the sera of patients with ovarian cancer and selecting two antigens that in combination performed better than CA125 alone in identifying ovarian cancer. Prostate cancer has also received considerable attention with many microarray studies performed including the use of reverse-phase protein arrays for following disease progression (Paweletz et al., 2001); a microarray of 184 antibodies used to examine 33 prostate cancer sera and 20 controls, identifying five proteins with significantly different levels in the two cohorts (Miller et al., 2003) and a study by Shafer et al. (2006) that indicated that thrombospondin-1 could differentiate between benign and malignant disease\u2014despite not correlating with PSA.",

The rate of introduction of new protein analytes into routine clinical use has averaged only 1.5 per year over the last 15 years (Anderson, 2010) with researchers offering explanations including a lack of effective technology platforms for verification in large sample sets, limited access to clinical samples, and an absence of a defined, coherent biomarker development pipeline (Rifai et al., 2006). An alternative view (Whiteley, 2008) suggests that the lack of new products available to the clinical laboratory is a reflection of industry risk avoidance, an academic focus on discovery and a lack of understanding by researchers of the high standards of robustness and reproducibility required to satisfy the regulatory agencies. This latter point has been accepted by the proteomics research community and in an effort to close the gap between candidate biomarker discovery and clinical utility, there have been several initiatives to try to remove the uncertainty among translational researchers as to the specific analytical measurement criteria needed to validate protein-based multiplexed assays. In this context, the US National Cancer Institute\u2019s Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer initiative (NCI-CPTC) (proteomics.cancer.gov) has proposed a preclinical verification stage in the biomarker pipeline, partnering with clinical laboratory organizations to develop common standards, and working closely with the FDA to educate the proteomics community with regard to evaluation requirements (Rodriguez et al., 2010, Boja and Rodriguez, 2011, Boja et al., 2011). As part of this process, members of the NCI-CPTC prepared two mock presubmissions of protein multiplexed assay descriptions to the Office of in vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety, US FDA, for feedback (Regnier et al., 2010). The guidance given included the need to give adequate attention to an understanding of potential failure modes that affect robustness and reliability and to take care in the selection of appropriate intended use populations relative to the collection and testing of specimens during validation.",

In the event of one (or more) analytes giving a response outside of the expected range, consideration has to be given as to how all the results of the other analytes should be handled. There are also issues to contend with regarding the release (or not) or unrequested results that have commercial, ethical, and legal implications\u2014all of which need to be addressed before tests can be commercialized.

However, ultimately success and the true measure of innovation are judged by the level of adoption into the application sectors for which the technology was intended. Ultimate success depends on clear definition of the problem being addressed, as well as the capability of the end-user organization to adopt the solution. At the present time, adoption of the LOC concept has been greater in the research setting than in any other setting. While clinical diagnostics have been highlighted in the foregoing discussion, there may be other arenas where application of both LOC and POC testing offers potential benefits, e.g., in environmental, food, and material authenticity testing. Speed, simplicity, and mobility are all desirable attributes, while financial and environmental issues are equally applicable to all modalities of testing. There is no doubt that it is in these markets that the greatest volume of applications are to be found. However, we know from the experience of POC testing (see Point-of-Care Testing) that adoption has been slow, and furthermore, barriers to the adoption of new technologies in health care have been acknowledged. One of the key barriers is a poor understanding of the unmet need that might be addressed by the new technology. While it might be self-evident that an analytical device should address an unmet need, it is recognized in clinical diagnostics that there is significant over-requesting of tests, which is probably encouraged by the predominance of the fee-for-service business model.",

This raised two issues. First, whether the patient (or the insurer) should have to pay for tests not required and second, a proportion of abnormal results were reported that were not relevant to the clinical condition being investigated. The consequence of this experience was the development of the discretionary analyzer, with a greater emphasis on \u201crelevant\u201d biomarkers or \u201cgroups of biomarkers.\u201d Consequently, while scope is a major attribute of the LOC concept, it presents a greater challenge to formulating the right \u201cgroup of biomarkers\u201d and demonstrating clinical utility. The ethical issues surrounding the generation of results not requested, referred to in the earlier discussion also has to be considered, as well as the growing demand for evidence of clinical utility as part of the patient demand for an improved quality of health care service.",

As a consequence, single analyte POC testing can begin to appear time consuming at the POC, when a small number of tests have to be performed sequentially on one patient. However, while the LOC solution might be the right answer, the challenge will lie in the choice of tests to be run in parallel, as many tests can appear in a number of clinically relevant menus; furthermore, these disease-related menus are not always limited to analytes measured using immunoassay principles.",
