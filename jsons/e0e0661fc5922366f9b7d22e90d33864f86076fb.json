In some cases (i.e. human immunodeficiency virus, HIV) [1] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [2] , coronaviruses (CoV) [3] , influenza virus (INF) [4] ), the envelope is extensively glycosylated. The gp120 envelope of HIV is among the most heavily glycosylated proteins known [5] . Protein glycosylation may serve multiple functions, including proper folding of the nascent peptide, avoiding peptide precipitation due to the presence of lipophylic amino acid domains in the protein, protection against breakdown by proteases, increasing molecular diversity, and last but not least, in some cases, escape of immune surveillance [6] . After the glycan building block (GlcNAc) 2 Man 9 Glc 3 has been added to asparagines of the native peptide that are part of a N-glycosylation motif (NXS/T), the N-glycans are processed by a-glucosidases to remove the terminal three glucoses in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). Then, ER and Golgi class I a1,2-mannosidases specifically hydrolyze a1,2-mannose residues, and catalyse the trimming of the high-mannose chains involving four a1,2linked mannose residues, and this process generates Man 5 Glc-NAc 2 . Subsequent action of GlcNAc transferase I initiates complex chain formation and yields the substrate for Golgi a-mannosidase II which trims the terminal a1,3-and a1,6mannose residues [7] . Further processing events in the Golgi apparatus eventually lead to glycans that consist of a wide variety of carbohydrates and combinations thereof [7] [8] [9] [10] . Since mammalian viruses use the host cell glycosylation machinery for glycan synthesis and modification of the glycans that need to be incorporated in their envelope glycoproteins, it has been suggested that it is possible to target the viral envelope glycoproteins by inhibiting certain host-cell glucosidases at low levels that do not affect host-cell viability [5] . The altered glycan structures on the viral envelope proteins may then result in decreased viral infectivity (fitness), virus assembly and/or virus particle release [5] . HIV infectivity has indeed shown to be suppressed in cell culture when the virus was propagated in the presence of the a-glucosidase inhibitor NB-DNJ [11] . The latter drug has been evaluated in phase II clinical trials as an anti-HIV therapeutic [12] . For hepatitis B virus (HBV), it was demonstrated that NN-DNJ (and also to a minor extent NB-DNJ) disrupted the proper folding and efficient release of the viral envelope molecules. It was shown that NB-DNJ could reduce virus levels in a dose-dependent manner [13] . Since the E1 and E2 transmembrane glycoproteins of HCV are important for host cell entry [14] , and since proper folding is calnexin-dependent [15] , glucosidase inhibitors may also be expected to affect HCV entry and infectivity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 146, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 173, "end": 176, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 199, "end": 202, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 227, "end": 230, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 356, "end": 359, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 707, "end": 710, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1410, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1565, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1569, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1573, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1578, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1945, "end": 1948, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2118, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2271, "end": 2275, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2368, "end": 2372, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2634, "end": 2638, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2730, "end": 2734, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2784, "end": 2788, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Recently, we have shown that carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) are able to force HIV-1 to delete part of the glycans on its gp120 envelope in an attempt to escape drug pressure [16] [17] [18] [19] .

As a result, the amount of high-mannose type glycan structures on the glycoprotein markedly increases in the presence of DMJ since further trimming/ processing of the high-mannose glycans to hybrid-or complex-type glycans has been largely prevented by the DMJ-mediated blockade of the a1,2-mannosidases I. Since the CBAs GNA and HHA are known to specifically bind to a(1,3)-and/or a(1,6)-mannose oligomer structures [23] , it could be reasoned that a higher amount of high-mannose type glycans on gp120 may allow these CBAs to concomittantly bind to a higher amount of glycans on the HIV-1 envelope. Consequently, they may exert a more pronounced antiviral activity in DMJtreated virus-infected cells. We observed indeed a potentiation of the anti-HIV-1 activity of HHA and GNA in the presence of DMJ concentrations that exerted themselves no antiviral activity when used as a single drug.

Whereas DMJ was not effective at all at 500 lM against parent wild-type virus it could indeed inhibit mutant virus infection at an EC 50 that ranged between 90 and 150 lM, that is at an at least more than 5-10-fold lower DMJ concentration. These mutant virus strains showed 7 or 8 glycan deletions at putative N-glycosylation sites in gp120 [22] , and the deletions preferentially occurred at high-mannose type glycan sites (Table 1) . Such glycan deletions in the mutant HIV-1 strains resulted in a marked phenotypic resistance to the HHA and GNA CBAs. It could be assumed that DMJ converts at least part of the remaining glycans of the mutant gp120 into high-mannose-type glycan structures, making them more vulnerable to interaction with the CBAs. Consequently, an increased antiviral activity would then be expected upon co-administration with DMJ, a phenomenon that we indeed observed to occur in the HIV-infected cell cultures. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon has been observed to occur when Pradimicin A, a high mannose-type glycan-binding antibiotic, was exposed to mammalian U937 cells that had been pretreated with DMJ [24] . Under these experimental conditions, the cells express high levels of high mannose-type oligosaccharides and become sensitive to PRM-A (resulting in apoptosis induction). No such apoptosis induction was observed in PRM-A-exposed cell cultures that were not pretreated with DMJ [24, 25] . Thus, the combined use of CBAs and the a1,2-mannosidase-inhibitor DMJ enabled partial restoration of the phenotypic sensitivity of the mutant HIV-1 strains against the CBAs. Our results argue for combined administration of CBAs and DMJ to wild-type virus, because phenotypic resistance development may be expected to slow down when DMJ is present during CBA treatment of HIV-1.
