A major problem is the simultaneous infection of a host by two or more pathogens (co-infection). We are continuously exposed to multiple potential pathogens; many people are chronically (e.g. HIV) or latently (e.g. herpes viruses) infected, and we all carry potential pathogens in our colonising microbial flora. This means that nearly every new infection is some sort of co-infection, and globally, co-infections are the norm rather than the exception [1].",

It generates a simple description of the data in the form of a combinatorial object called a simplicial complex, that captures topological and geometric information of the point cloud in high dimensional space. The algorithm uses a (combination of) function(s) that map the data to a metric space, and builds an informative representation based on the clustering of subsets (which are associated to the values of the function(s)) of the data set. In the simplest case, this method reduces high dimensional data sets to a network whose nodes correspond to clusters in the data and edges to the existence of points in common between clusters. The aim of this algorithm is not to obtain a fully accurate representation of a data set, but rather a low-dimensional image which can highlight areas of interest, possibly for further analysis and quantification.",

These previous approaches are based on differential equations constructed based on biological reasoning. While they are suitable tools to test different hypothesis, and have helped elucidate many of the details of the mechanisms of these intricate systems, these models are susceptible to bias by the designer and model complexity rapidly limits the reliability in the parameter fitting procedures [24].

Instead, here it is sufficient to think of simplicial complexes as a generalisation of networks that include higher dimensional elements. That is, simplicial complexes can be thought of as combinatorial objects consisting of vertices (0-d), edges (1-d), triangles (2-d), tetrahedra (\u201ctriangular pyramid\u201d) (3-d) and higher-dimensional (n-d for n>=0) convex polyhedra. Fig. 3\nillustrates this visually with a simple example. In practical terms, as described in [19], \u201cusing a single function as a filter we get as output a complex in which the highest dimension of simplices is 1 (edges in a graph). Qualitatively, the only information we get out of this is the number of components, the number of loops and knowledge about\u201d local and global component structure. \u201cOne natural way of building higher dimensional complexes is to associate many functions with each data point instead of just one.\u201d In particular, \u201cthe dimension of simplices which we use to construct the complex\u201d associated to two lenses \u201cwill be 4 or less\u201d (depending on the covering of choice).",

Biologically it makes sense that the simplicial complexes for the three infection groups have only one connected component. From the resulting list of simplicial complexes with one connected component, we ordered the simplexes in ascending order of epsilon value for the clusterer and the percentage overlap for the intervals for both lenses; choosing the smaller rather than the larger values for these parameters makes the simplicial complexes, as models of the system, simpler, which is desirable when working with models. Next, we chose simplicial complexes that had number of vertices at least half of the number of data points in the data set (for example, if the data set for the IAV infection group has 30 data points then we favour simplicial complexes that consist of only one connected component and at least 15 vertices); choosing this number gives a good resolution, not too simple, but also prevents the user from choosing simplicial complexes that have oversampling of data points. Finally, we visually inspected the simplest (in terms of small values for the parameters) 10, 20 or 30 simplicial complexes in that list. The visual inspection has two purposes: First, to give the user an idea of whether there is persistence in the global and local structures of the simplicial complexes generated.

Nodes are colored by the average value of their samples for the variables listed in the Figs\u2019 legends and color maps. Three types of parameters are needed to generate a topological model: First is a notion of similarity, called a metric, which measures the distance between two points in some space (in our case, the points are the rows in the data and the space is a multidimensional space that can be plotted using the quantitative measurements of disease symptoms as axes, such as the pathogen load or cytokine concentration, i.e. the features of the data set). The metric we used is the correlation distance. Second are lenses, which are functions that describe the distribution of data in a space. A lens is a mathematical mapping (function) that converts a data set into a vector, in which each row in the original data set contributes to a real number in the vector; i.e. a lens operation turns every row into a single number. Metrics are used with lenses to construct the simplicial complex output. Multiple lenses can be used in each analysis. In this case, Keppler-Mapper handles them mathematically by considering the Cartesian product. Third is the resolution, which controls the number of bin partitions that will be created within the range of selected lens values, known as the number of intervals, and the amount of oversampling between bins, known as the percentage overlap. Clustering then takes place within the bins, forming the final vertices of the simplicial complex; and clusters are connected with an edge whenever they share data points within the region that are over-sampled according to the percentage overlap. Therefore increasing the number of bins increases the number of vertices and increasing the percentage overlap results in an increased number of edges. The metric, lenses, resolution, and clusterer used to generate the topological graphs in Figs. 5\nand 6\nare as indicated in Table 1\n. K-Nearest Neighbour Analysis was implemented using the KNeighborsClassifier from the Scikit Learn Python library [29], with the correlation metric. T-tests were done using the ttest_ind function from the SciPy Python library.",

More specifically, using our semi-unsupervised algorithm, we tested the cosine, euclidean and correlation metrics, along with different epsilon values for the clusterer. Furthermore, all analysis was done using two lenses and we tested different combinations of the following: projections to the features of the data sets (i.e. the values of the pathogen load or the concentrations of the cytokines), the distance to the two nearest neighbours, the first two dimensions of various linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms and projections to (the image of) functions that reveal interesting geometric and statistical information about the data, such as density, eccentricity or centrality. We tested between 2 and 30 intervals for each lens and 10 different values for the percentage overlap of the lens\u2019 intervals and the epsilon parameter of the clusterer.

The boxplots clearly revealed that data points of IAV + T4 from 26 and 31 h post co-infection are separated by the simplicial complex from the earlier data points and that 18 and 26 hpc represent a transition point for the system, since at both time points there are data subsets that belong to both groups in the simplicial complex (the yellow and the teal/purple).

The bottom right panel, inside the orange dotted box, corresponds specifically to the data points of the co-infection group (IAV + T4). The data sets in this region can be divided into three groups: the early period (1.5 hpc), the transition period (6 hpc) and the later period (between 18 and 31 hpc). This is illustrated by the fact that within the orange dotted box, the data sets at 1.5 hpc are neighbours with only data sets at 1.5 and 6.0 hpc, the data sets in 6 hcp have neighbours in both the early and the later groups and data sets at 18, 26 and 31 hpc have neighbours only at 6 hpc and late time points. This can be seen more clearly in Fig. 8B which shows the correlation coefficients between data points in the co-infection data set. Data sets at 1.5 hpc are closely correlated to themselves, data sets at 6 hpc have close correlation to points in both the early and later periods, the later data sets (18, 26 and 31 hpc) are closely correlated to themselves only.

In other words, the early co-infection data sets are closely correlated with the data sets in the IAV single infection group and the late co-infection data sets are closely correlated with the data sets in the T4 single infection group. Putting these three observations together, we can conclude that the immune response in the co-infection inherits its early response from the primary viral infection but at 6 hpc it undergoes a shift and quickly shapes its response to defend against the secondary bacterial infection.",

Recently, in conjunction with experimental data, theoretical approaches have been able to uncover infection control mechanisms, establish regulatory feedback, connect mechanisms across time scales, and determine the processes that dictate different disease outcomes [30].

We call this phase 1 of the immune response. Subsequently, the system undergoes an abrupt transition at 6 hours post onset of the secondary bacterial infection as it quickly modulates itself and starts responding predominantly to the bacterial infection; this is phase 2 of the immune response. There is a second transition stage between 18 and 26 h post co-infection after which the immune response does no longer resemble the behaviour under a single viral or bacterial infection, but presumably shapes its response to the co-infection itself; this stage we call phase 3.",

It is to be expected that a topological approach to study infectious diseases where hosts recover would also reveal circular topological simplicial complexes. This is not the case for the data set we have used. For the three infection groups, the data sets do not contain information for the full course of the infections. More specifically, the data set of the single IAV infected group is based on data starting from day 7 post the onset of the viral infection. The data set for the co-infected groups is incomplete towards the end of the infection course because for ethical reasons the mice that developed a high morbidity had to be euthanized before the bacterial infection is resolved naturally. Nevertheless, we found hints of looping behaviour in the co-infection, as discussed in Section 3.1.",

For example, we speculate that the segregation of specific data sets represents striking changes in feature values - i.e. changes in concentration of cytokine of pathogen load from one time point to the others. This seems indeed to be the case as explained earlier in this discussion. However, for example, striking changes in bacterial burden and viral load in the co-infection are shown in Table 2, where the bacterial burden changes significantly between 1.5 and 6 hpc and between 6 and 18 hpc and the viral load changes significantly between 18 and 26 hpc. In this case, it is not clear exactly how these changes are represented in the simplicial complexes of Fig. 6. Therefore further quantification is required in order to understand in more detail the information that the choice of lenses provide in the biological context.",
