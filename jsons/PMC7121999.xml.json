            "text": "In the last decade a powerful quantitative proteomic approach has been developed in which proteins are marked using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). This technique was developed by Ong et al. [1] in 2002 and makes use of in vivo incorporation of stable isotopes allowing mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomic analyses. Typically, two cell pools are used for SILAC experiments: one with cells grown in normal medium (containing the \u201clight\u201d amino acids) and one with cells in medium in which one or two essential amino acids are replaced by the \u201cheavy\u201d isotope forms of these amino acids, allowing for the identification of peptides from each sample in MS-MS spectra. After a few cell passages, all proteins produced by the cells in the \u201cheavy\u201d medium have incorporated the \u201cheavy\u201d amino acids. Cells in the \u201clight\u201d and \u201cheavy\u201d medium can then be treated differently, e.g., treated versus non-treated or infected versus non-infected cells. The cells from both treatments are then combined in a 1 to 1 ratio and differences in protein abundance due to the treatment can be assessed and quantified by MS (Fig. 1) [2]. SILAC has become a powerful tool to investigate changes in the host cell proteome upon infection with an intracellular pathogen, allowing elucidation of host\u2013pathogen interactions [3\u20139].\n\n",

In this way, specific compartments of the host cell, such as the organelles that make up the secretory pathway, can be studied.",

After statistical analysis, 105 proteins were identified that were significantly changed in their abundance in the Golgi-enriched fraction upon Salmonella infection. This technique was also previously applied in our laboratory to investigate interactions of coronaviruses with the host secretory pathway [11].",

Before performing SILAC experiments, it must be ensured that cells are labeled completely and how many passages this takes to accomplish. Therefore, this should be tested using the protocol below. Upon complete incorporation of labeled amino acids, the protocol described here results in peptide mass shifts of 8 and 10 amu for each lysine and arginine in the peptide, respectively.\nFor the 13C15N-arginine- and 13C15N-lysine-labeling of HeLa cells, cells are cultured in specialized medium: DMEM lacking l-arginine and l-lysine, which is reconstituted with the heavy amino acids, l-arginine-13C6\n15N4 hydrochloride and l-lysine-13C615N2hydrochloride (referred to as heavy medium). As a control for the extent of labeling, cells are also cultured in medium with the normal, light amino acids, l-arginine-12C6\n14N4 hydrochloride and l-lysine-12C6\n14N2 hydrochloride (referred to as light medium) (see\nNote\n8).The heavy and light culture media are supplemented with dialyzed FCS and pen/strep (see\nNote\n9).Cells are passaged in fresh medium when 80\u201390 % confluency is reached. The extent and efficiency of the stable isotope labeling of the HeLa cells are checked using MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis as shown previously [8] (see\nNote\n10).When the mass spectrometry analysis shows that the incorporation of the 13C15N amino acids is complete (Fig. 2), the SILAC experiments can be performed. In our case, incorporation was complete after 1 or 2 passages, but for practical reasons, cells that had been passaged six times in the heavy medium were used in the SILAC experiments.\n\n\n",

Autoclave for 20 min and allow the solution to cool to 55 \u00b0C. Store the liquid LB broth at room temperature or 4 \u00baC. For agar plates, pour approximately 15 ml into petri dishes and let solidify at room temperature. Store the plates at 4 \u00baC.For 29 % w/w sucrose solution dissolve 65.08 g sucrose in 200 ml of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4; for the 35 % w/w: 80.60 g sucrose in 200 ml of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and for the 62 % w/w sucrose: 161 g sucrose in 200 ml of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4. Prepare the solutions in advance and dissolve with rotation ON at 4 \u00b0C. Sucrose solutions can be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.Medium is removed from the cells and cells are washed by rinsing them carefully with PBS, 2 ml of trypsin is added to the cells and the flask is incubated in the incubator at 37 \u00b0C/5 % CO2 for a few minutes. Cells are removed from the surface by carefully tapping the flask. Add medium (10 ml) and transfer the cells into a 15 ml tube (Corning). Cells are centrifuged at 500 \u00d7 g for 5 min. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml medium and the cell density is determined by cell countering under the microscope using a cell counter. A specific number of cells (see\nNote\n4) is transfered to new flasks or plates in medium and incubated in the incubator at 37 \u00b0C/5 % CO2.Different volumes of DMEM and number of HeLa cells are used, depending on the type of plate, indicated at the specific steps of the protocol.For overnight cultures, add 1 Salmonella colony (from a freshly grown agar plate) into 4 ml LB broth in a 15 ml tube (Corning) and incubate for 16\u201318 h at 37 \u00b0C with continuous shaking. Add 1 ml of the overnight culture to 32 ml of LB broth in a 50 ml tube (Corning) and incubate for another 3.5 h at 37 \u00b0C with continuous shaking to reach the exponential phase, as described before [13].HeLa cells are infected with Salmonella at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100. This means that 100 times more bacteria then HeLa cells are added to the cells. For this, the bacteria from the 33 ml culture are centrifuged for 15 min at 1,000 \u00d7 g after which the pellet is resuspended in 1 ml DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS (no pen/strep!). By performing a growth curve of Salmonella, we determined that after 3.5 h the concentration of bacteria in the 33 ml culture 3.5 h is 8.3 \u00d7 108 bacteria/ml. The growth curve of Salmonella should be repeated for the strain that is used in the experiments. Since the number of HeLa cells is known (specified in the specific steps of the protocol), the volume of bacteria that corresponds with an MOI of 100 can be calculated. HeLa cells are carefully rinsed with PBS and incubated in DMEM, supplemented with 10 % FCS (no pen/strep) and the right amount of bacteria. Cells are incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. During these 15 min, the Salmonella bacteria attach to the HeLa cells.After the attachment of the bacteria to the cells, the medium is removed from the cells and the cells are washed with PBS (adding and removing of 15 ml of PBS) to get rid of cell debris and any loose bacteria. Cells and bacteria are then incubated in medium containing 100 \u03bcg/ml gentamycin. The stock solution of gentamycin has a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Therefore, this solution should be diluted 1,000 times in DMEM/10 % FCS.The \u201cheavy\u201d amino acids l-arginine-13C6\n15N4 hydrochloride and l-lysine-13C6\n15N2 hydrochloride, or the \u201clight\u201d amino acids l-arginine-12C6\n14N4 hydrochloride and l-lysine-12C6\n14N2 are added to specialized DMEM lacking l-arginine and l-lysine, at a final concentration of 84 mg/L and 146 mg/L for arginine and lysine, respectively. Instead of using commercially available normal \u201clight\u201d DMEM, we choose to add the light amino acids to specialized DMEM lacking l-arginine and l-lysine. In this way, we prepared the heavy and light media in exactly the same manner.10 % Dialyzed FCS and 100 IU of penicillin/ml and 100 \u03bcg of streptomycin/ml are added to specialized DMEM. Dialyzed FCS is used because dialysis depletes FCS of small molecules such as amino acids, hormones and cytokines while avoiding the precipitation of serum proteins. In this way, \u201cnormal\u201d l-arginine and l-lysine remains absent in specialized DMEM.To check the incorporation of the \u201cheavy\u201d amino acids into the cells, MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis is performed as described [8]. For this analysis, cells passaged in light and heavy medium are trypsinized, centrifuged for 10 min at 500 \u00d7 g and pellets are resuspended in 1 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % nonidet P-40, 0.5 % NaDOC, 0.1 % SDS, 2 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 2 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, 1 \u03bcg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF). After an incubation on ice for 10 min, the nuclei are spun down by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 \u00d7 g at 4 \u00baC, and the supernatant is used for MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis.For the SILAC experiments 4 T175 flasks with 1 \u00d7 107 cells are infected with Salmonella at a MOI of 100. Therefore, 100 \u00d7 107 bacteria are needed per flask, which is 400 \u00d7 107 bacteria in total. Since the 1:33 culture contains 8.3 \u00d7 108\nSalmonella/ml, 400 \u00d7 107 bacteria corresponds with 4.8 ml of bacterial culture. This volume of bacteria is taken and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 \u00d7 g after which the pellet is resuspended in 40 ml of DMEM/10 % FCS. 10 ml is added per flask and infection is carried out as described in Subheading 3.2. The other 4 flasks are mock-infected. In that case, the same procedure is followed but instead of Salmonella bacteria, DMEM is used. The SILAC experiments must be repeated at least three times; 2 experiments in which the \u201cheavy\u201d cells are infected with Salmonella and 1 experiment in which the \u201clight\u201d cells are infected.After Salmonella infection, remove the medium from the cells, and wash the cells carefully with PBS. Add 5 ml homogenization buffer per flask. Using cell scrapers harvest the cells from the flasks and combine them in a 1:1 ratio in a 50 ml tube. Centrifuge the cells at 500 \u00d7 g for 10 min (4 \u00baC). In order to wash the cells, resuspend the pellet in cold Homogenization Buffer (HB) and transfer them to a 15 ml tube (10 min, 500 \u00d7 g, 4 \u00baC). Measure the volume of the pellet and add four times HB with protease inhibitors, incubate on ice.Carefully remove the HB as the pellet is loose after this step.It is important to estimate as good as possible the volume of the pellet and to add not more than 5 volumes (of the pellet estimated volume) of HB to ensure sufficiency and reproducibility of the homogenization.Check the homogenization efficiency at the microscope using a vital stain such as Trypan Blue after every 10\u201320 strokes. In general 50\u201360 strokes are needed to ensure disruption of about 90 % of the cells. However, the number of strokes are dependent of the pressure given by the operator. Be careful not to homogenize the cells excessively as too harsh conditions may affect the integrity of intracellular membranes and contaminate your preparation.If the sucrose concentration is out of the range 36.5\u201337.5 (w/w), adjust by adding either 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 7.4) or sucrose solution (2 M).

The interfaces have to be easily recognized after layering. Only then the floated Golgi-enriched fraction is easy to see and collect.After centrifugation carefully remove the tube from the centrifuge bucket. Use a syringe with a needle of 22G to puncture the tube and to collect the Golgi-enriched band (see Fig. 5).\n\nDetermine the protein concentration of the collected fraction (usually 0.15 \u03bcg/\u03bcl), aliquot the Golgi fraction into Eppendorf tubes, snap-freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen and then store at \u221280 \u00b0C.Protein concentration of the Golgi-enriched fraction is measured using the Bradford protein assay. The volume corresponding to 80 \u03bcg of protein is added to an Eppendorf tube, centrifuged at maximal speed for 10 min (4 \u00baC). Pellet is resuspended in 20 \u03bcl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 10 mM DTT and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C. Samples are cooled on ice.Adding a drop of sample buffer to un-used wells will help to form straight dye front during the electrophoresis.After Coomassie staining, each gel lane is cut into 24-equally sized pieced, using a razor blade. Cut around the edges of the complete lane and remove this lane from the gel. Next, equally divide the lane into 24 pieces (see Fig. 4). Transfer each piece into a Eppendorf tube.DTT is added to reduce cysteines and to disrupt sulfur bridges. Iodoacetamide is added to prevent the formation of new sulfur bridges. The cycle with AcN and Ambic dehydrates and rehydrates the minced gel slices for washing and absorbance of reagents and trypsin in the gel slices. During this cycle, the solutions have only to be added for a few seconds, after which the solutions can be removed again.In this step, the peptides derived from trypsin-digested proteins are loaded onto the trapping column. This step can be compared to the loading of proteins into the stacking gel when performing a SDS-PAGE gel. No separation takes place at this step.After loading of all peptides onto the column, valves are switched and the gradient from solution A to B starts running. More complex samples, e.g., samples containing peptides from various proteins, require longer run times. Peptides are eluted from the trapping column, with the most hydrophilic peptides coming off first, and the most hydrophobic peptides coming off last.In the identification of peptides, some room for error (incorrect measurements of peptide and peptide fragment masses) is allowed. The more accurate the mass spectrometer can determine peptide and fragment mass, the smaller the error will be, yielding higher confidence in identifications.During preparation of peptide mixtures, some peptide modifications can occur. As such modifications affect peptide (and fragment) mass, and mass changes have to be taken into account to deduce to identity of each peptide and fragment. All cysteine residues in the sample are reduced and subsequently alkylated using iodoacetamide, yielding a mass addition of 57.02146 amu on each cysteine. Oxidation, which can occur but does not necessarily affect all methionine, tryptophan or histidine residues, yields a mass change of 15.99491 amu.Nowadays, many programs for quantitative analysis of mass spectrometry are available. Many of them have the option to calculate differential quantities based on different labeling methods such as SILAC, iTRAQ or label-free quantitation. Also protein identification is integrated, generating a robust quantitative proteomics analysis pipeline.\n",

Cells from the two pools are combined to a 1:1 ratio, proteins are separated and digested in gel with trypsin. Subsequently, the peptides are applied to a mass spectrometer (MS), analyzed and quantified. Ratios are calculated between the \u201clight\u201d and \u201cheavy\u201d peptides, which reflect differences between protein abundance in the two cell pools. Adapted and modified from Oda et al.
