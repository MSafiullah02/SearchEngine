The first major change in the magnitude, location, and nature of practice occurred during 1914-1918 with World War I and the need to evaluate new recruits for potential military service, particularly with the deployment of the Army Alpha and Beta tests. Clinical psychology and clinical practice experienced a big growth in psychological testing (particularly IQ testing). Growth and range of practice in the 20 years after the war were modest, but not insignificant (VandenBos, Cummings, & DeLeon, 1992) .",

This more or less coincided with NASA's foray into telehealth through the use of physiologic monitors for astronauts (Nesbitt, 2012) .

Over 1,000 respondents provided commentary or requests. The top five mostfrequently mentioned topics were (a) how to do psychological testing online, (b) specific information and detail on billing and coding, (c) sample forms and recommendations on getting/receiving forms during the crisis, (d) recommendations about platforms (including features and security) to use for telepsychology, and (e) how to do online screening and intakes. Other requests included information on interstate practice, Medicare and insurance coverage for phone sessions, and training for conducting online supervision. The last group of notable requests included providing online services to children and youth, conducting group and family therapy online, and marketing/referral generation. Information on best practices (including ethics and risk management) for telepsychology was also requested. We are pleased to report that this content was provided in seven webinars hosted by the National Register and The Trust in April of 2020 (available at https://www.nationalregister.org/education-training/webinars; https://parma.trustinsurance.com/Resource-Center/COVID-19-Resources).",

Telepsychology practice went from 29% of users employing online platforms for a portion of their practice to over 80% conducting almost all their practice online. This is an amazing practice transformation that occurred in just 1-2 weeks. This rapid shift occurred because the technology was available, and some processes and procedures were already in place for telepsychology, including online practice guidelines (Joint Task Force for the  Development of Telepsychology Guidelines for  Psychologists, 2013) . Additionally, most psychologists had some level of exposure to telepsychology practice even if they were not doing it regularly.",

The medium and long-term consequences of this caseload reduction are not yet apparent, but we believe that dues-driven psychological organizations may see a reduction in their overall memberships, and organizations that provide services to psychologists, such as meetings and conventions, may also experience reduced attendance numbers.",

From the inception of service delivery to evaluation of outcomes of assessment or psychotherapy conducted via telepsychology, fundamental practical and risk-management differences exist. Psychologists may be unaware that a separate informed consent form is required when transitioning from in-person to telepsychology services. An explicit safety plan including emergency contacts and resources at the patient's location is likewise required, as are protocols to ensure patient privacy when receiving at-home psychological services (Alvord, 2020) .",

Providers who are deemed to operate in good faith will not be prosecuted for privacy or security violations, regardless of whether or not the services delivered are specific to COVID-19. This does not, however, render the psychologist immune from civil action resulting from inadvertent disclosure of protected health information, and individual jurisdictions may elect to pursue their own sanctions for such breaches. Also of concern is that some respondents used electronic service delivery platforms that may not have HIPAA required Business Associates Agreements (BAAs), such as WhatsApp. Although other platforms such as Doxy.Me or Zoom do provide BAAs, similar, less expensive platforms do not have privacy or security safeguards consistent with HIPAA standards. We did not query specifically as to BAAs associated with users' platforms. While it can be confusing and time-consuming to sift through the evolving changes, psychologists have an ethical and professional responsibility to ensure the protection of their client's welfare, which cannot be deferred. Consulting with others (always recommended even when there is no crisis) who have more experience practicing telepsychology or are aware of managing risk is critically important.",

Traditional methods for determining practice standards and ethical conduct of service provision during such times are insufficient.

In such times, consultation and sound clinical judgment based on the needs of the individual patient may become the best sources of guidance for the practitioner. Also, documenting the thought and decision-making process is as important as the decision itself.",

Much depends on state and federal laws and regulations as well as reimbursement decisions made by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and private thirdparty payers. Ultimately, however, patient and provider acceptance will determine the extent to which distance service provision becomes a more widespread component of the treatment repertoire. It is our belief that, by availing themselves of extant and developing resources such as those provided by the National Register, The Trust, and other organizations, psychologists will become sufficiently comfortable with this medium to create lasting change, and that both practitioners and patients will benefit from expanded access to mental health services.",
