Over the past decade, new knowledge has substantially enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis, outcome and natural history of AECOPD. The exacerbations not only greatly reduce the quality of life of these patients, but also result in hospitalization, respiratory failure, and death. The exacerbations are the major cost drivers in consumption of healthcare resources by COPD patients. Although bacterial infections are the most common etiologic agents, the role of viruses in COPD exacerbations is being increasingly recognized. The efficacy of antimicrobial therapy in acute exacerbations has established a causative role for bacterial infections. Recent molecular typing of sputum isolates further supports the role of bacteria in AECOPD. Isolation of a new strain of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae was associated with a considerable risk of an exacerbation. Lower airway bacterial colonization in stable patients with COPD instigates airway inflammation, which leads to a protracted self-perpetuating vicious circle of progressive lung damage and disease progression. A significant proportion of patients treated for COPD exacerbation demonstrate incomplete recovery, and frequent exacerbations contribute to decline in lung function. The predictors of poor outcome include advanced age, significant impairment of lung function, poor performance status, comorbid conditions and history of previous frequent exacerbations requiring antibacterials or systemic corticosteroids. These high-risk patients, who are likely to harbor organisms resistant to commonly used antimicrobials, should be identified and treated with antimicrobials with a low potential for failure. An aggressive management approach in complicated exacerbations may reduce costs by reducing healthcare utilization and hospitalization.",

Worsening of one or more chronic symptoms including dyspnea, cough, sputum production, or sputum purulence appears to be the most commonly accepted definition.

[17] Increased sputum purulence was previously thought to be associated with bacterial exacerbations. [29] Airway infection rather than colonization activate secondary host defenses and recruit neutrophils to the airways. [30] Therefore, an acute exacerbation will be associated with change of sputum color from mucoid to purulent (myeloperoxidase from neutrophil azurophil granules is green colored), which will reverse on resolution. [30] Stockley et al. [31] studied sputum characteristics in 121 COPD patients presenting with an acute exacerbation. A positive bacterial culture was obtained from 84% of patients who expectorated green, purulent sputum. White or clear sputum yielded a positive bacterial culture in only 38% of exacerbations. In contrast, on repeat sputum culture in stable state, the incidence of positive bacterial culture was similar (38% and 41%, respectively) with purulent and mucoid sputum. Furthermore, all exacerbations associated with mucoid sputum improved without antimicrobials. This study provides additional evidence that bacteria play an important role in causing acute exacerbations and that antimicrobial success can be predicted simply by recognizing sputum color.

Over a 3-year period, 173 patients with COPD developed 362 exacerbations; 180 exacerbations were treated with placebo and 182 with antimicrobial therapy. The exacerbations were classified according to the Winnipeg criteria based on symptoms of increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and increased sputum purulence. A type I exacerbation was defined when all three symptoms were present, type II when two symptoms were present and type III when there was only one symptom (table I) . Therapeutic success was defined as 'resolution' if all symptoms returned to baseline within 21 days, 'no resolution' if all symptoms did not resolve and 'failure with deterioration' when symptoms worsened. Considering all exacerbations, treatment with antimicrobials led to higher resolution (68.1%) compared with placebo (55%, p < 0.05) [ figure 2 ]. Deterioration occurred in 9.9% of those treated with antimicrobials, compared with 18.9% with placebo (figure 3). The rate of peak flow recovery was faster with antimicrobial treatment compared with placebo. Analysis according to the a priori subgroups showed that the exacerbations classified as type I achieved the greatest success with antimicrobial therapy (62.9% vs 43% with placebo, p < 0.05). In type II exacerbations, the antimicrobials were still associated with better outcome than placebo, whereas the success with antimicrobial therapy was not significantly better than placebo in type III exacerbations. Correspondingly, deterioration occurred less frequently on antimicrobial therapy in patients categorized as type I or type II exacerbations. Overall, the length of illness was 2 days shorter for the antimicrobial-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group.",

[98] levofloxacin, and H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were 100% susceptible. The incidence of penicillin non-susceptibility to S. pneumoniae remained similar to or higher than previously reported: France, 165 of 291 (56.7%); Germany, 46 of 506 (9.1%); Greece, 20 of 55 (36.4%); Italy, 45 of 364 (12.4%); Spain, 146 of 268 (54.5%); and the UK, 26 of 386 (6.7%). The \u03b2-lactamase production among H. influenzae isolates ranged from 6.2% to 33.1% per country. A higher resistance against Pneumococcus has been reported from Spain (53.4%) than in Italy (15.1%), whereas erythromycin resistance was higher in Italy (42.9%) than in Spain (28.6%). [91] Selective pressure from antimicrobial prescription appears to be the most important factor associated with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. Resistance is encountered more commonly in patients who have identifiable risk factors, including age >65 years, prescription of \u03b2-lactam antimicrobials during the past 3 months, previous hospitalizations, and nursing home residence. [86, 92] However, the majority of studies have not classified the exacerbations in detail and have not demonstrated a difference in clinical outcomes with newer or the older antimicrobial agents. [93] [94] [95] Grossman et al. [96] assessed safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin versus standard antimicrobial care in patients with moderate-tosevere bronchitis and at least four exacerbations in the previous year. A trend towards accelerated resolution with ciprofloxacin existed but the difference was not statistically significant in this open-label, uncontrolled study. A retrospective analysis performed by Madaras-Kelly et al. [97] concluded that the use of older versus newer antimicrobials did not independently predict either the outcome or the subsequent development of an exacerbation. ",
