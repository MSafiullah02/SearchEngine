            "text": "Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causative agents of various tumours such as cervical cancer. HPV binding to the cell surface of keratinocytes leads to virus endocytosis at tetraspanin enriched microdomains. Complex interactions of the capsid proteins with host proteins as well as ADAM17-dependent ERK1/2 signal transduction enable the entry platform assembly of the oncogenic HPV type 16. Here, we studied the importance of tetraspanin CD9, also known as TSPAN29, in HPV16 infection of different epithelial cells. We found that both overexpression and loss of the tetraspanin decreased infection rates in cells with low endogenous CD9 levels, while reduction of CD9 expression in keratinocytes that exhibit high-CD9 protein amounts, led to an increase of infection. Therefore, we concluded that low-CD9 supports infection. Moreover, we found that changes in CD9 amounts affect the shedding of the ADAM17 substrate transforming growth factor alpha (TGF\u03b1) and the downstream phosphorylation of ERK. These effects correlate with those on infection rates suggesting that a specific CD9 optimum promotes ADAM17 activity, ERK signalling and virus infection. Together, our findings implicate that CD9 regulates HPV16 infection through the modulation of ADAM17 sheddase activity.",

HPV high-risk types, including the most oncogenic type HPV16, are causative agents of cervical cancer. This kind of tumour is known as the most prevalent viral infection of the female genital tract with ranking as the fourth most frequent cancer in women [3, 4] .

A direct association of CD9 with the metalloproteinase ADAM17 was reported in monocytic and endothelial cells. Through that interaction, CD9 was shown to negatively regulate ADAM17 shedding activity, resulting in reduced release of its substrates, the tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) [31] . This functional interaction between CD9 and ADAM17 has been subsequently confirmed in other cell types and for additional ADAM17 substrates. In this regard, Tsukamoto et al. reported that CD9 negatively regulates the shedding of the substrate LR11, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family which has a key role in cell migration, adhesion, and drug resistance, in various leukaemia cell lines [32] . Furthermore, Liu et al. have recently shown the direct association of CD9 with ADAM17 in keratinocytes and confirmed that CD9 exerts negative regulatory effects on this metalloproteinase resulting in diminished shedding of its substrate heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) and reduced activation of EGFR/ERK signalling pathway, crucially affecting keratinocyte migration and wound healing [33] .",

As earlier described, control siRNA-treated HeLa cells showed prominent HPV16-CD63 colocalization in vesicular structures (Fig. 1b, upper panel) . By contrast, CD9-depleted cells showed only a minor colocalization of L1 and CD63 while viral capsids localized in the cell periphery (Fig. 1b,  lower panel) suggesting that HPV16 uptake and trafficking to MVBs are disturbed. To verify the crucial role of CD9 in regulating early HPV16 trafficking, a prerequisite for capsid disassembly, we examined the quantity of disassembled capsids in endosomes. Here, we used the disassemblyspecific monoclonal antibody L1-7 that recognizes a linear L1-epitope, which is only accessible after capsid disassembly [13] . CD9 knockdown led to a strong reduction of L1-7 positive pixels (Fig. 1c) again demonstrating the functional relevance of CD9 for HPV16 entry.",

Using equal protein amounts in the cell lysates and the same exposure times for all tested cell lines, we found that HaCaT cells exhibit a four-to ten-fold higher CD9 expression level, when compared to HeLa and NHEK cells, respectively. These results suggest that the contrary outcome in infection rates in HeLa and NHEK versus HaCaT cells is associated with the different intracellular expression level of CD9. Hereby, both a particularly high (HaCaT) and the absence of CD9 protein (CD9-siRNA depleted HeLa and NHEK) seemed to have a negative effect on the infection rate.

Furthermore, modulation of the CD9 amounts, both through its increase or decrease, led to a reduction of ERK1/2 activation in HeLa cells. These effects correlate with those on infection rates.

The sheddase activity of ADAM17 has been proposed to be also regulated through other factors, such as interaction with integrin \u03b15\u03b21 [57, 58] . Associations between the sheddase and this integrin resulted in the inhibition of both the adhesive capacity of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and the metalloproteinase activity of ADAM17 due to steric hindrance leading to the decreased accessibility of its catalytic site for the substrates. Moreover, the formation of tri-molecular complexes comprising CD9, ADAM17, and integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and interactions between laminin-binding integrins have been described [28, 56, 59] . Therefore, varying expression levels of CD9 could influence integrin localization and activity that might also contribute to the observed changes in HPV16 infection rates, as integrins are important proviral factors contributing to virus binding and signalling.",

Likewise, during influenza A virus (IAV) and coronavirus (CoV) entry, CD9 mediates the close proximity of a protease and the virus enabling the cleavage of viral proteins which is a precondition for infection [24, 60, 61] . Similar concepts of the regulation of signaling pathways by tetraspanins is summarized in Kummer et al. in this issue [62] . Therefore, we propose that CD9 might regulate the local distribution of the protease ADAM17 and its EGFR-activating substrates, which then influences the organization of the HPV16 entry receptor platform and eventually infection.",

As CD9 interacts directly with ADAM17 and with its EGFR-activating substrates, a high amount of CD9 in these microdomains would impose limitations in the movement of these molecules, restraining the accessibility of substrates to the catalytic site of ADAM17, thus resulting in their reduced shedding and EGFR/ERK activation required for HPV infection. Likewise, an almost complete loss of CD9 in the microdomain might enhance the free diffusion of both protease and substrates but at the cost of reducing their effective local concentrations on the plasma membrane required for the optimal accessibility of substrates to the catalytic site of ADAM17, again leading to impaired shedding. Only a low level of CD9 would then ensure the proper membrane composition for storage, diffusion, and accessibility of ADAM17 and its EGFRactivating substrates. Therefore, this low-CD9 expression level represents the CD9 optimum which enables efficient virus infection.",
