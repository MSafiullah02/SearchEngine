The porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) spiker gene used in this work was cloned from the Chinese isolate TH-98 (GenBank Accession No. AF494337). As shown in Fig. 1\n, the TGEV S protein is a typical type I membrane protein. The HR1 and HR2 regions were predicted by using the computer software of LearnCoil-VMF, freely available from the website (http://night-ingale.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/vmf)[19]. The predicted HR1 region covers amino acids 1045\u20131184, whereas the relevant HR2 includes the amino acids 1339\u20131378 (Fig. 1). Considering the feasibility of the soluble expression of the fusion core generated in this experiment, the HR1 and HR2 regions of TGEV were adequately truncated and extended, respectively, on the basis of the multiple alignment of TGEV with the other coronaviruses in the conserved regions. Finally, the TGEV fusion core (2-Helix construct) was made by linking the modified HR1 (1057\u20131119) and HR2 (1326\u20131383) with a flexible linker (SGGRGG, single amino acid abbreviation used here), and then was inserted directionally into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1(Pharmacia) via the restriction sites BamHI and XhoI (introduced by PCR primers). The acquired recombinant expression plasmid, which harbored the interested DNA fragment of the TGEV fusion core was verified by direct DNA sequencing.",

There is no doubt that it may result in an extremely enormous economic loss to piglet cultivation in the world every year, and thereby has attracted the attention of several virologists in the world to research the pathogenic mechanism of TGEV, and even interaction between TGEV and the host, porcine. In fact, so far, the only way used to prevent the disease is to inoculate ordinary vaccines, which are either inactivated or tissue culture ones with much disadvantages, such as high cost, low effectiveness, etc. Just due to lacking of effective vaccines or drugs, it seems to be very urgent and important to rationally design and eventually develop some genetically engineered vaccines or drugs specific for TGE [2].",

            "text": "Our results here showed a reasonable version of TGEV fusion core, which is a typical stable 6-helix coiled-coil bundle. Different experiment evidences all supported that TGEV belongs to Class I envelope virus, sharing the similar molecular mechanism of membrane fusion to those of both retrovirus and paramyxovirus. Moreover, a 3D structure of TGEV fusion core, with maximum likelihood, was proposed by the homologous model. The current knowledge has told us that HR1 or its derivatives of NDV [20], [21], HR2 or its derivative coming from HR2 (HIV, SARS-CoV, MHV, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, etc.) [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [15], [22], and even both HR1 and HR2 of hRSV [11], [12], [14] can inhibit the membrane fusion during the virus entry into its host, perturbing the successful infection of virus. It will be of interest to test whether HR1 or HR2 has the inhibitory activity in the next work. Anyway, it did first provide us the biochemical and biophysical basis of the TGEV fusion core, pointing out a novel direction to design the polypeptide or small molecule drugs, perturbing TGEV fusion with its host membrane, for the prevention and therapeutics of TGE.",
