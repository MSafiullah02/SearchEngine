Furthermore, new polymerase chain reaction and serological tests arise each week, often with limited performance information, which adds to the confusion about COVID-19 tests. 1 People with psychiatric conditions or substance use disorders, particularly those in residential treatment or inpatient facilities, are at increased risk of exposure to COVID-19, not only because of the difficulty in evaluating their medical symptoms and history, but also because of frequent patient turnover, limited space and staff, and general resource constraints in many facilities. Patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-the virus responsible for the development of COVID-19-pose a substantial threat of spreading the virus because they come in contact with other susceptible individuals given the close quarters and communal living environments. Furthermore, these patients are at higher risk for complications of COVID-19 because they frequently have underlying medical conditions that worsen their prognosis (eg, cardiac disease, history of smoking).",

Testing capacity has improved; however, access remains limited and test sensitivity is modest, which results in false negatives. 4, 5 Test performance is further compromised by variations in test quality, sample collection, and duration of symptom onset, increasing the potential for error. 6 For example, for a patient presenting with disorganised thinking or altered mental status, determining the date of onset of non-specific symptoms such as a cough might be difficult. Thus, the pretest probability of infection with SARS-CoV-2 could be hard to estimate. Fundamentally, when the sensitivity of a test is limited and the disease course for a patient is unknown, the test outcome could be unreliable and infectious patients could be placed erroneously in treatment facilities.",
