The routinely used realtime RT-PCR is sensitive, specific and able to process large batches of samples. However, turnaround time is long and in cases where fast obtained results are critical, molecular point of care tests (POCT) can be an alternative. Here we report on a multicenter evaluation of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test. Study design: The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated against the routine in-house realtime RT-PCR assays in three medical microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands. A sensitivity and specificity panel was tested consisting of a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and ten samples containing SARS-CoV-2 and a range of other seasonal respiratory viruses. Additionally, 58 samples of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with different viral loads and 30 tested negative samples in all three Dutch laboratories using an in-house RT-PCR, were evaluated using Cepheids Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges. Results: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point of care test showed equal performance compared to routine in-house testing with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.26 copies/mL. Other seasonal respiratory viruses were not detected. In clinical samples Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reaches an agreement of 100% compared to all in-house RT-PCRs Conclusion: Cepheids GeneXpert Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable addition for laboratories in situations where rapid and accurate diagnostics are of the essence.",

Since its emergence, the disease COVID-19 caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly with at the end of April worldwide more than 3 million cases and deaths reaching 200.000(2). Clinical symptoms range from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe bilateral pneumonia, with large numbers of patients being admitted to hospital, putting tremendous pressure on health care systems (3) (4) (5) . The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on a combination of clinical symptoms with or without radiological imaging, confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 PCR (6) . Currently, either an RT-PCR targeting the envelope (Egene) in combination with polymerase (RdRp-gene) is being used as described by Corman et al. (7) or targeting the nucleoprotein (N-gene) as described by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (8) . However ",

Current routine molecular diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 are able to perform high throughput processing, however turnaround time is relatively high which hinders patient management and infection control policies.",

The two samples with E-gene and N2-gene only results in Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 were retested in in-house RT-PCR, thus freeze-thawing, these turned out to be negative. This indicates that viral loads of these sample are at the limit of detection which for the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 was found to be around 8.26 cp/mL and that multiple freeze-thaw steps of samples understandably has a significant impact on detection.",

Additionally, a recent evaluation of multiple molecular point of care tests showed an LOD of 100cp/mL (11) (12) (13) . This discrepancy is most likely due to the different methods used for determining input concentrations. Digital PCR used to determine the number of copies per mL was performed on positive-strain genomic RNA. The RdRp PCR also detects negative strain genomic RNA and the Egene PCR additionally detects subgenome messenger RNA which is why the true number of target templates for the diagnostic PCR in the sensitivity panel is probably higher. This could explain the differences in LOD.",

Three of the samples containing different concentrations of heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus tested positive at all laboratories in both the in-house RT-PCR and the GeneXpert. One sample containing 8.26 cp/mL of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 SARS-CoV-2 gave an N2-only result in one out of three laboratories. The N2-gene only positive specimen was retested with Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 at lab 3 and was positive for both targets with E-gene at Ct 39.8 and N2-gene at Ct 42.2.(Figure 1).In the other two laboratories, this sample gave positive results in both the routine diagnostic test and the Xpress assay. Sensitivity panel Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 8.26*10 -1 cp/mL in all three labs. At this dilution all in-house RT-PCRs tested negative. The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a positive or 'presumptive positive'(E-gene only) at all three laboratories for this dilution(11). All three labs retested this specimen on a different day (implicating freeze-thaw step) in the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay with negative result for both target genes. Ct values reported by the individual in-house PCRs varied for similar dilutions of viral load, with laboratory one being able to detect samples at 8.26 cp/mL where the other two laboratories failed to detect SARS-CoV-2. (Clinical samples All samples both E-gene and RdRp gene positive in the in-house PCR were positive in the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (figure 3). All samples negative in the in-house SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR were negative in the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Seven of the SARS-CoV-2 negative specimens selected by lab 1 were positive with considerable viral load for influenza virus A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 or B/Victoria, RSV-A, RSV-B, rhinovirus or enterovirus D68 and thereby providing additional information about the specificity of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. For the panel consisting of E-gene positive and RdRp-gene negative samples, most but not all were positive in the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Two samples in laboratory 1 showed an N2-gene only and E-gene only result (figure 4).",

From a technical point of view, the process is time consuming with sample RNA extraction and PCR run-time of approximately 6 hours and a turnaround time of 12-24 hours. Since providing fast results is of critical importance in a time of shortage of medical personnel, protective materials and beds onisolation wards and to insure timely and adequate treatment for patients, developing high quality rapid point of care diagnostics is essential. Antigenic tests have the potential in providing quick diagnosis, however sensitivity thus far has been lacking which makes them unreliable. Molecular point of care tests reduce the time to result from a couple of hours to less than an hour but with the same performance as real-time RT-PCR in the laboratory(9, 10).
