As the continuous growth of world population, the constant changes of human life style and the continued deterioration of natural environment, higher requests for food safety are put forward by human society. Therefore, we should not only ensure the safety of quantity, but also to ensure the safety of quality in the food safety field by 2050. New concepts and technological means should be adopted to ensure the constant production and supply of the \"green\" and safe agricultural production to meet the people's great need for food safety, nutrition and health.",

Biological toxins come in a wide variety and some of them such as the aflatoxin and Aspergillus varsicolor toxins in maize and peanut have been proved to be the main inducers for the regional liver, stomach and esophagus; the tetrodotoxin, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning and neurotoxic shellfish toxins in the aquatic products can have enormous influence on physiological functions of the human body. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by fungi and more than 200 kinds of them have been known at present. The intake of agricultural and livestock products contaminated by mycotoxin may make human or animals suffer from food poisoning. More seriously, many fungal toxins that have carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic function will cause chronic damage to the human body. The treatment and pollution control of biological toxin poisoning is still a worldwide problem today. (1) Build the standard production model of planting Agricultural standardization refers to the use of the standard principles of \"unification, simplification, coordination and preference\" depending on the advanced agricultural science and technology achievements and experience to make agricultural produce antenatal, medium and postpartum processed standardly, to ensure the quality and safety of agricultural products. In developed countries, the agricultural products basically have achieved the standardization, and have established a relatively complete support system of agricultural standardization. At present, the green food standardization is the most influential one. For the green food production, firstly, it emphasizes the best ecological environment; secondly, it emphasizes the full-process production management. It proves that the agricultural standardization is playing an increasingly important role in the quality and safety of agricultural production.",
