A few days later, the same virus was detected in a Qatari patient receiving intensive care in a London hospital, highlighting the role of air travel in early spread of disease, as was the case in SARS in 2002. Since its discovery in 2012, MERS-CoV has reached 26 countries affecting approximately 1,300 people, including a dozen children, and claiming nearly 500 lives. 17 Most MERS-CoV cases (>85%) reported thus far have a history of residence in, or travel to, the Middle East, predominantly confined to six countries: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, and Kuwait, although travel-related cases have been identified in Tunisia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy. The zoonotic vector and reservoir of MERS-CoV are dromedary camels, with bats as another possible vector for transmission to humans. 18 Surveillance With our current level of medical knowledge and the existing global political and economic situation, we cannot realistically hope to prevent new pathogens from emerging, as is demonstrated by the emergence of a second highly patho-genic coronavirus within a decade, MERS-CoV. The best opportunities to prevent global spread of a new pathogen are rapid and early identification systems to allow control measures to be put in place to prevent its spread.",

It assists with selection of future vaccine strains and monitors for the emergence of viral resistance. Since the reemergence in 2004 of the highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1, GISRS also has a role in the identification of novel influenza or other viruses causing Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI, defined as a fever of at least 37.8 or self-reported fever, and either a cough or a sort throat, and hospital admission) 21 and in the identification of a potentially new pandemic pathogen. The importance of early identification of a pathogen with pandemic potential in increasing the capability for effective control measures is self-evident. For early warning systems to work, specific triggers are needed for immediate reporting of possible occurrence of a single or multiple cases that might be the first indicators of the emergence of a novel respiratory virus. To assist with this and as part of the global public health response after the SARS epidemic, the WHO established the international health regulations in 2005 22 (see below). These internationally binding regulations require all countries to report all cases of human influenza cause by new viral subtypes to the WHO. 23 Other important signal events in early recognition of respiratory viral infections with a pandemic potential are SARI or pneumonia in health care workers that indicates the development of human-to-human transmission (as occurred in the SARS epidemic) and clusters of SARIs in social or occupational connected individuals. Other surveillance triggers are a shift in age distribution, increase in mortality, or increase in number of cases. 24, 25 ",

Following the global threat of an infected physician traveling from China to Hong Kong in February 2003, 12 Chinese authorities received international criticism for not revealing the extent of the epidemic earlier, prior to SARS spreading internationally, when it could have potentially been contained. 26 The delay in the Chinese communicating the extent of the epidemic to the international community was a combination of political considerations as well as significant deficiencies in the structure of its public health service that severely limited its ability to recognize and track potential epidemics. 27, 28 The SARS pandemic highlighted that few countries possessed the necessary surveillance and response capacities to rapidly detect and control emerging infectious diseases. 29 The deficiencies of the 1969 International Health Regulations (IHR) at the global level had been acknowledged, and attempts to revise them were ongoing before 2003, but the SARS outbreak added new urgency and momentum for change. These were updated in close consultation with WHO member states, international organizations, and other relevant partners, and were adopted by the 58th World Health Assembly on May 23, 2005 and the adoption began from June 15, 2007 .

Limited resources in most countries have resulted in investments in surveillance capacity predominantly in those countries affected by major outbreaks, such as the case with an outbreak of influenza A H5N1 virus infection in Thailand, China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. 35 The response to the H7N9 infection by the Chinese authorities in 2013 demonstrates the substantial improvements made in international surveillance compared with the SARS outbreak in 2002. On March 31, 2013, China notified the WHO of the first recorded human infections with avian H7N9 virus. The poultry markets were rapidly identified as a major source of transmission of H7N9 to humans and were quickly closed down in the affected areas. The health authorities collaborated with the WHO in risk assessments and communication, with heightened surveillance in humans and poultry and prompt reporting of new cases. As a result, the infection was contained to China with 139 cases (82% had a history of exposure to live animals, including chickens) and 34% death rate. 36 The Global Health Security Agenda 37 launched in the United States in 2014 is a program to link the U.S. government, other nations, international organizations, and public and private stakeholders.

In Australia, for example, just 20 days after quarantine measures were enacted for H1N1, public health authorities conceded defeat in the face of widespread infection in the general population. 48 The difference in effectiveness of control measures in containing SARS and H1N1 are due to the differences in the infectivity of the viruses and the speed of onset of infectivity after initial exposure. The fact that SARS continued to be viewed as a serious mortality threat whereas H1N1 rapidly became regarded as a predominantly non lethal disease may also have reduced public compliance with public health measures for the latter. 49, 50 Unfortunately, many countries are more focused on preventing new cases of infection from entering their borders rather than preventing established cases from leaving. As this is the more commonly adopted approach, the WHO suggests that entry screening should be considered in passengers arriving from countries where there are concerns about the presence or thoroughness of exit screening. 41",

Unfortunately, no cases were detected for over 35 million travelers screened. 53 There was a similar story with H1N1 where IRT was found to be both ineffective and inaccurate. 54 IRT may be influenced by several confounding factors including age and outdoor temperature, and in addition, results from studies looking at IRT as a tool to detect fever tend to have small positive predictive values due to the small prevalence of febrile passengers. 25 The use of quarantine and entry screening at international borders is costly and in some countries its use has created considerable debate about the legality and ethical basis for this approach. [55] [56] [57] [58] The IHR 2005 specifically addresses issues of human rights related to quarantine and travel restrictions, 22 stating travelers' dignity and fundamental freedoms should be respected as well as minimizing any discomfort or distress and providing food, accommodation, and interpreter services. A review of experiences from the H1N1 pandemic revealed that compliance with these sections was far from universal. 59 The cost and time taken for additional screening measures are also predicably not popular with airlines. 60",

            "text": "A controversial area with viral epidemics is the extent to which air travel itself is responsible for infecting passengers. Modern high-efficiency particulate air filters in aircraft recirculate air within very localized cabin areas, 60 in theory containing most of the risk to within two rows of the infective individual. Of course, pathogens vary in their innate infectivity; however, even for a highly contagious virus like H1N1, there is considerable debate. Modeling from Wagner et al based around a single individual infected by H1N1 suggested that in long-haul flights from 7 to 17 people may be infected during the flight. 61 Analysis of a group of students suffering inflight exposure to H1N1 found the risk to be approximately 3.5% for those seated within two rows of the index case. 42 It is not safe, however, to assume that there is no risk beyond the two-row limit, with one case of SARS leading to infection of 22 of 120 passengers and crew dispersed throughout the aircraft. 62 In an ideal world, passengers should be responsible and not travel when symptomatic, which, combined with effective exit screening, should significantly reduce the risk to fellow passengers. However in practice, many people fly while actively infected with respiratory tract infections and airlines seldom refuse to allow them to board, possibly due to the many practical and potentially legal issues that would ensue, over complex issues such as who has responsibility for their care, who pays for additional accommodation, canceled flights, medical expenses, etc. Again the extent to which airlines and airline crew are prepared to act to prevent passengers with active respiratory tract infections from boarding is likely to be highly influenced by the level of threat they perceive the circulating epidemic poses to them. In the event of a highly lethal infection, we can expect substantial reductions in airline traffic including possible complete prohibition of travel between countries. In the event of infections of less perceived threat, such as with H1N1, there was virtually no limitation placed on air travel.",

Early information with respect to MERS has shown that the transmission of MERS-CoV among family contacts remains relatively low but that the infection causes a spectrum of disease from asymptomatic to severe and that, compared with SARS, MERS-CoV appears to kill more people (40 vs. 10%) more quickly and is especially more severe in those with preexisting medical conditions. 17",

            "text": "Another lesson from H1N1 in 2009 is that our pandemic plans need to be flexible and the public health response needs to be able to adapt quickly to nuances of individual pathogens. Virtually all pandemic influenza plans were based around an assumption that the vast majority of infected individuals would be febrile, leading to initiatives such as fever clinics and quarantine of febrile patients until a diagnosis was established. 41 With H1N1, many infected individuals were not febrile, nor were there any specific clinical characteristics that made it possible to define infected versus noninfected patients. Well after it was recognized by clinicians that fever was often not present with H1N1, public health officials were still discussing establishing fever clinics in Australia. These types of communication breakdowns between clinicians and public health officials are another area that needs to be improved so that the whole process of responding to epidemics is substantially more flexible. 65 Isolation SARS highlighted the central role of health care facilities as hubs of dissemination. Most cases of SARS outside of China were acquired in a health care setting, 66 health care workers representing 21% of cases with a mortality rate of 9.6%. 45 In the hospital setting, it is critical to treat all patients with respiratory tract infections as contagious and have appropriate protective measures in place to protect staff and other patients. The psychological impact on health care workers of dealing with an epidemic should not be underestimated and needs to be addressed as part of any response plan. 67 While SARS severely tested the quarantine capacity of most hospitals, H1N1 overwhelmed them. Few, if any, hospitals have been built with the capacity to isolate all patients individually, which led to cohorting of suspected cases and potentially spread between them to originally uninfected individuals. Again the capability to be able to rapidly make a diagnosis is critical to managing the quarantine situation. Basic measures such as limiting or preventing visitors, keeping the number of hospital staff having contact with infected patients to a minimum, strict infection control with basic measures of handwashing, and proper fitting masks that are fit for purpose are all critical. 68, 69 All public health pandemic plans advise that where possible infected individuals should be kept at home. Infected individuals need to be told not to go to work or other public areas and employers need to be educated to enforce these guidelines. This is particularly important with hospital staff, with some health authorities instigating regular temperature checks of staff during the SARS epidemic. 70 ",

These policies vary regarding not only the choice of product used, but also the application and specifications, reflecting the relative lack of level-one evidence available to inform policy development. For the health care worker, the availability of conflicting guidance about mask use from different sources (such as the WHO and in-country guidelines) is confusing and reflects the major gaps around the modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, the efficacy of cloth masks, and the impact of extended and reuse of masks/respirators. 77",

Due to the low number of cases worldwide, pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to pursue vaccine production as the costs of clinical trials are high.

Experience from previous pandemics has taught us that health care institutions are major foci of disease transmission and all institutions need to have the facility to isolate infected patients as well as have maximal protection for staff. There is no doubt that personal protective measures such as handwashing and avoidance behaviors are effective, and the general public also needs to act responsibly by staying at home when unwell and not traveling when potentially infective. Mechanisms for early international communication around clinical features such as infectivity, disease course, and treatment responsiveness are becoming more robust, with trust improving between countries.",
