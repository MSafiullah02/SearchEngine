However, different levels of skill and a wide range of contributions are needed if public health programmes are to make the most impact. The different domains of practice help to construct a basis for understanding the necessary elements of the public health system and the still mix needed. They are a dynamic concept not meant to rigidly demarcate territory but to promote greater understanding of public health practice.",

The relevance of the public health approach not only to primary care but also to the hospital-based sector becomes apparent, as does its relevance to communities, the voluntary sector and local government. Integration of the three domains, a common definition and the framework for the public health system will support effective delivery of health improvement.",
