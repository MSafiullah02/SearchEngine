            "text": "Successful biomedical relation extraction can provide evidence to researchers and clinicians about possible unknown associations between biomedical entities, advancing the current knowledge we have about those entities and their inherent mechanisms. Most biomedical relation extraction systems do not resort to external sources of knowledge, such as domain-specific ontologies. However, using deep learning methods, along with biomedical ontologies, has been recently shown to effectively advance the biomedical relation extraction field. To perform relation extraction, our deep learning system, BiOnt, employs four types of biomedical ontologies, namely, the Gene Ontology, the Human Phenotype Ontology, the Human Disease Ontology, and the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, regarding gene-products, phenotypes, diseases, and chemical compounds, respectively. We tested our system with three data sets that represent three different types of relations of biomedical entities. BiOnt achieved, in F-score, an improvement of 4.93% points for drug-drug interactions (DDI corpus), 4.99% points for phenotype-gene relations (PGR corpus), and 2.21% points for chemical-induced disease relations (BC5CDR corpus), relatively to the state-of-the-art. The code supporting this system is available at https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/ BiONT.",

Typical examples describe diseases that are associated with mechanisms that originate phenotypic abnormalities as a result of modified gene expression, as well as the action of drugs on those diseases [4] , among others. One significant step to fully understand biological systems mechanisms is to extract and classify the relations that exist between the different biomedical entities, namely chemicals, diseases, genes, and phenotypes. In literature, authors classify this problem as a Relation Extraction (RE) task. Biomedical RE aims to extract and classify relations between biomedical entities in highly heterogeneous or unstructured scientific or clinical text.",

Thus, a structured representation of the semantics between entities and their relations, an ontology, allows us to use it as an added feature to a machine learning classifier. Some of the biomedical entities structured in publicly available ontologies are genes properties/attributes (Gene Ontology (GO)) (45003 terms) [1, 23] , phenotypes (Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)) (25810 terms) [12] , diseases (Human Disease Ontology (DO)) (18114 terms) [21] , and drugs/chemicals (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI)) (133104 terms) [8] 1 .",

[13] . These knowledge-bases provide not only relevant characteristics about the respective entities but also about the underlying semantics of the relations they establish. This information is not expressed directly in the training data but usually reinforces a relation between two entities in the text. The novelty of our system is that expands the previous work done by Lamurias et al. [13] by using four types of domain-specific ontologies, and combine them to extract new types of relations, along with word embeddings [19] and WordNet hypernyms [5] . BiOnt successfully replicates the results of the BO-LSTM application, using different types of ontologies. Our system can extract new relations between four biomedical entities, namely, genes, phenotypes, diseases, and chemicals. Figure 1 shows how these four types of biomedical ontologies can be combined to aid the relation extraction of ten different combinations of biomedical entities. The BiOnt system also explores the use of entities that are not direct entries in an ontology (e.g., genes), linking each entity to their most informative annotation concept within a corresponding ontology (e.g., GO). Our method incorporates more ontologies than the previously mentioned systems and is evaluated using three state-of-the-art data sets. The BiOnt system can be used to effectively populate knowledge bases regarding gold standard relations. Ultimately, it can be used to explore new experimental hypotheses providing evidence to researchers and clinicians about possible unknown associations between biomedical entities. Fig. 1 .

The latter represents the relations between the ancestors for each ontology concept corresponding to an entity (Fig. 2) . The model assumes that the input data already has the offsets of the relevant entities identified and their respective concept ID, the Named-Entity Recognition and Linking tasks. However, while most entities already corresponded to an ontology concept ID, some entities, such as genes do not have a direct entry in an ontology. BiOnt matches these entities to their most representative concept in the Gene Ontology [1] . To match the gene to their most representative GO term the priority was given to concepts inferred from experiments, for having a more sustained background and usually be more descriptive. For tie-breaking, if we have several GO terms inferred from experiments, the choice is the term that is the most specific (i.e., with the longer ancestry line). As stated previously, our system expands the work done by Lamurias et al. [13] by using four types of domain-specific ontologies, and combine them to extract new types of relations. Therefore, to allow this diversity of relations, we adapted the BO-LSTM model common ancestors and the concatenation of ancestors channels. Since the common ancestors' channel could only be used for relations between the same type of biomedical entities, we only use the concatenation of ancestors channel for the relations between different biomedical entities.",

            "text": "The Phenotype-Gene Relations Corpus (PGR) [22] is a corpus that describes human phenotype-gene relations, created in a fully automated manner. Due to being a silver standard corpus is not expected to be as reliable as manually annotated corpora. Nonetheless, the authors show the system efficiency by training two state-of-the-art relation extraction deep learning systems. The PGR corpus combines 4283 human phenotype-gene relations. Relations (3) . The BioCreative V CDR Corpus (BC5CDR) [16] is a corpus of chemical-induced disease (CID) relations. The BC5CDR corpus consists of 3116 chemical-disease interactions annotated from PubMed articles. To use the BC5CDR corpus, we had to preprocess the documents linking the annotations of the relations to their sentences. We assumed that if two entities share a relation in the document, they will continue to share that relation if present in the same sentence of that document. Table 1 presents the relation extraction results of our system, BiOnt, for each data set. For all three data sets, our system performs better using the ontological embeddings layer (+ Ontologies), than just using the word embeddings and WordNet classes layers (State-of-the-art), by an average of 0.0404. The most relevant contribution for this metric was an increase in recall for the DDI and PGR corpus, and in precision for the BC5CDR corpus. The ontology embeddings contribute to the identification of more correct relations, with a small trade-off in precision, for the DDI corpus. For the other two data sets, the ontological embedding layer does not damage the precision, while more correct relations are identified. For the DDI corpus, the BiOnt system, due to the inherent variability of the preprocessing phase (by randomizing the division between training and test sets), when comparing with the BO-LSTM system, performed slightly worse (0.7246 in F-score) than the previously reported results (0.7290 in F-score). The paper supporting the PGR corpus [22] reported some deep learning applications results, including with the BERT [7] based BioBERT [14] pre-trained biomedical language representation model (0.6716 in F-score). Our system outperformed those results with an F-score of 0.7941. Regarding the BC5CDR corpus, our system outperformed the best system (0.5703 in F-score) in the challenge task chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction of BioCreative V, by 0.0693 [24] , with 0.6396 in F-score. The differences in F-score, for the distinct data sets, are mostly due to how they were built, and the completeness and complexity of the respective ontologies. For instance, the PGR corpus is a silver standard corpus, therefore, could have entities that were poorly identified, not identified at all, or not linked to the right identifier. The BC5CDR corpus was annotated for documents, not regarding the offsets of the entities that shared a relation in each document, which is also a possible limitation.",
