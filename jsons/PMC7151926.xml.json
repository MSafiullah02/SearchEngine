Many cases of acute diarrhea are self-limiting, even if mucosal damage is severe, because intestinal epithelial cell turnover is rapid and new, normal epithelial cells will quickly restore normal intestinal function. Treatment need only be supportive and symptomatic, since most animals that die from diarrhea do so not as a result of the underlying cause of diarrhea but from the loss of water and electrolyte imbalance, with subsequent dehydration, acidosis, and shock. In many cases, extensive diagnostic workups are not needed.In contrast, chronic diarrhea is rarely self-limiting and a diagnosis is needed for optimal treatment. In many cases, biopsy of the GI tract is indicated. Supportive care is less likely to be needed in cases of chronic diarrhea.7.\nWhat are the principles of symptomatic management of acute diarrhea in the dog?\nMany dogs with acute diarrhea do not require symptomatic therapy. In those cases, however, when the dog is visibly ill or dehydration is present, it is advisable to initiate more aggressive supportive care.8.\nWhat dietary modification is indicated with acute diarrhea?\nFood should be withheld in most cases for 24 to 48 hours; this will be especially effective in dogs with osmotic diarrhea. After this time, a bland diet fed frequently in small quantities is recommended. Then the normal diet is gradually added to the bland diet to allow return to a normal diet.9.\nIs fluid therapy indicated with acute diarrhea?\nMaintaining fluid balance is vital because diarrhea causes dehydration and the resultant changes in electrolyte and acid-base balance can cause death, especially in puppies. In dogs that are drinking, adequate fluid balance can be maintained by providing them with water. Oral rehydrating solutions can also be used; these combine water with glucose or glycine. The glucose or glycine helps to increase sodium absorption, which in turn increases water absorption.In dogs that are debilitated, are dehydrated, are vomiting, or have major electrolyte disturbance, intravenous fluid therapy is preferable. In many dogs the subcutaneous route will not provide adequate amounts of fluid. If intravenous fluids are to be used, a minimum laboratory database is indicated to help tailor fluid therapy optimally.10.\nWhen do I use motility modifiers for managing diarrhea? What drugs do I use?\nMotility-modifying agents are most appropriate for cases of large-bowel disease, when the dog is not ill and the diarrhea is more of a hygiene problem (e.g., leads to accidents in the house). Narcotic analgesics (loperamide, 0.1 mg/kg every 8-12 hours, diphenoxylate, 0.1-0.2 mg/kg every 8-12 hours) can be effective in treating diarrhea. These medications delay bowel transit time by increasing nonpropulsive contractions and muscular tone of the gut while decreasing propulsive activity. Opiates also influence the transport of water and electrolytes through the intestine and reduce intestinal fluid accumulation, stool frequency, and stool weight (volume). Anticholinergic agents generally are not indicated for the treatment of diarrhea, because they induce ileus.11.\nAre locally acting protectants and absorbents indicated for diarrhea therapy?\nBismuth-subsalicylate, kaolin, and activated charcoal are some of the medications that have been recommended for treatment of diarrhea. Salicylate-containing products can be useful in managing secretory diarrhea. Other agents are generally thought not to be efficacious.12.\nWhat should I look for to support the use of antimicrobials in a case of acute diarrhea?\nThe use of antibiotics with diarrhea is not routinely indicated. However, when extensive damage to intestinal mucosal is suspected, an antibiotic should be used. Mucosal damage is thought to allow penetration of the intestinal wall by bacteria, which are subsequently released into the systemic circulation. Antibiotics are also justified in cases of symptomatic bacterial infection when a known pathogen is diagnosed.\nEvidence of extensive mucosal damage includes the following:\n\u2022Fever\u2022Leukocytosis/leukopenia\u2022Hemorrhagic diarrhea\u2022Very sick animal\u2022Positive blood culture\n13.\nWhat are the clinical signs of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE)?\nThe term hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE) refers to a collection of clinical signs. The cause of HGE is variable; often the syndrome is idiopathic. In some cases Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin is suspected to be the underlying cause. The dogs show hemorrhagic diarrhea and frequently hematemesis. Marked hemoconcentration may also occur. The onset is acute and dramatic. Hypovolemia is often seen.14.\nHow is HGE diagnosed?\nThe appropriate clinical signs, together with a PCV greater than 60%, are consistent with HGE, although this is not an etiologic diagnosis. In most cases when the PCV is elevated, total protein will be normal.15.\nHow is HGE treated?\nAggressive fluid therapy is vital in these animals; many require initial resuscitation with high dose fluids. After fluid therapy hypoproteinemia may develop, and colloid therapy may be needed. Antibiotics are often used because of the compromised intestinal barrier.\n",

The virus is related to feline panleukopenia and mink enteritis virus. The virus attacks host cells that are rapidly dividing.17.\nWhat clinical signs are associated with parvovirus infection?\nClinical signs are variable, and in some cases, none are apparent. In most cases vomiting, profuse diarrhea, pyrexia, anorexia, and depression are noted. This disease can progress to shock and sepsis. The diarrhea is often hemorrhagic, because the intestinal crypts are destroyed, which leads to the villi being denuded of epithelial cells. Marked hypoproteinemia can occur, as can neutropenia due to the virus attacking rapidly dividing cells in the bone marrow. In the past, myocarditis leading to sudden death was seen in puppies after in utero infections, although this phenomenon is no longer seen.18.\nHow is parvovirus infection diagnosed?\nAppropriate clinical signs in a young dog with inadequate vaccination should always raise concern about parvovirus infection. Neutropenia is a highly suggestive sign; not uncommonly, the neutrophil count is less than 1000/\u03bcl. In many cases this infection can be definitively diagnosed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) performed in-house on feces. Usually this assay will demonstrate viral antigen. A weak positive reaction is possible in recently vaccinated dogs. Electron microscopy is an alternative diagnostic tool.19.\nHow is parvovirus infection treated?\nGiven the severe fluid losses in these animals, aggressive fluid therapy is required. Hypoglycemia develops frequently and when present, is an indication to add glucose to the intravenous fluids. Antibiotic therapy (ampicillin or cephazolin in uncomplicated cases, ampicillin with an aminoglycoside in cases with sepsis or severe neutropenia) is indicated in all dogs. If vomiting is persistent, use of an antiemetic would be of benefit. Some studies have shown that early enteral alimentation may be a consideration as well. In severely hypoproteinemic dogs, plasma administration can be helpful.20.\nWhat sequelae can occur with parvovirus infection in dogs?\nWith the marked disruption of the GI barrier, sepsis or endotoxemia can develop. Damage to the intestine can also lead to intussusception.21.\nWhat is the prognosis with parvovirus infection?\nIf aggressive supportive care is provided, the prognosis is generally good. Concurrent GI tract disease (corona virus infections, GI parasites) leads to a worse prognosis.22.\nWhat clinical signs are seen with corona virus infection in dogs?\nThe diarrhea with this disease is variable and usually self-limiting.\n",

            "text": "\n23.\nWhat role do bacteria play in canine diarrhea?\nBacteria are known to be a common cause of diarrhea in all species. There are, however, difficulties determining if a given bacterial species is causing diarrhea in a dog. Many of the pathogenic bacteria are also found in dogs that do not have diarrhea. In some cases there is genetic variability in the bacterial species that can lead to virulence, for instance, the presence of enterotoxigenic Clostridia. This genetic variability usually cannot be determined by simple cultures.24.\nWhat role do Campylobacter species play in canine diarrhea?\n\nCampylobacter spp. can be pathogens in dogs, predominantly Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter helveticus, and Campylobacter upsaliensis. These species are considered to have zoonotic potential in dogs, even though most human cases of Campylobacter infection are contracted from contaminated food, especially poultry. Diarrheic and nondiarrheic dogs can harbor these bacteria, and in many studies isolation rates were similar (up to 50% positive, especially in young kenneled dogs).25.\nWhat are the clinical signs of Campylobacter spp. infection?\nSigns are variable. Watery to mucoid to hemorrhagic diarrhea can occur, as can an asymptomatic carrier state.26.\nHow is a Campylobacter infection treated?\nEither macrolide antibiotics or fluoroquinolones can be used, though most cases would resolve without resorting to antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy is indicated given the zoonotic potential, however. Erythromycin is considered the drug of choice, though it can cause GI upset. Fluoroquinolones can be used, but resistance can develop rapidly.27.\nWhat role do Salmonella spp. play in canine diarrhea?\nSalmonella is a potential pathogen, although inapparent carrier states commonly occur. This is a potential zoonotic infection. Prevalence rates vary, but in the typical dog population about 1% of dogs will have the bacteria. Higher rates are seen in kennel populations, racing Greyhounds, racing sled dogs, and dogs fed raw-meat diets.28.\nWhat clinical signs are associated with salmonellosis?\nSigns are variable, from inapparent carrier state to severe diarrhea/septicemia. Diarrhea can be watery, mucoid, or hemorrhagic. In more severely affected animals, fever, abdominal pain, and sepsis can occur. These animals will often also show changes on CBC such as a neutrophilia with a left shift and evidence of toxic change.29.\nHow is salmonellosis treated?\nFor sick animals, supportive care is indicated. Antibiotics should be reserved for more severely affected animals. Antibiotics should probably be given to all dogs that have hemorrhagic diarrhea. Fluoroquinolones are the drugs of choice for this infection.30.\nWhat role does E. coli play in canine diarrhea?\nIt is difficult to ascertain the role that E. coli plays in diarrhea, because this organism is often cultured from dogs without diarrhea. Some strains of E. coli have virulence factors that can lead to disease developing. Some strains thought to cause diarrhea include enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC).31.\nWhat role does C. perfringens play in canine diarrhea?\nAs with other bacteria, C. perfringens is commonly isolated from dogs with or without diarrhea. It is thought that the production of enterotoxin by some strains leads to diarrhea, although nondiarrheic dogs can also have enterotoxin-producing strains of C. perfringens. The enterotoxin is released during sporulation of the bacterium.32.\nHow is C. perfringens diarrhea diagnosed?\nIt is not possible to definitively determine if C. perfringens is causing diarrhea. Neither detection of enterotoxin nor large numbers of spores are limited to dogs with diarrhea.33.\nWhat is meant by small-intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)?\nBacteria can be found in the small intestine, and under certain conditions they can begin to proliferate. The abnormal proliferation results in malabsorption and diarrhea. However, there is no universally accepted upper limit for the number of bacteria normally found in the small intestine, and therefore it is impossible to determine the level that represents SIBO.34.\nHow is SIBO diagnosed?\nQuantitative bacterial cultures are necessary to establish a diagnosis, although this is controversial. Elevations in serum folate concentration and decreased serum cobalamin concentration are also suggestive. Response to antibiotic therapy may also allow a presumptive diagnosis, although its diagnostic value is tentative at best.35.\nHow is SIBO treated?\nA variety of antibiotics are used, including amoxicillin, metronidazole, and tylosin.\n",

With time, vomiting, anorexia, and progressive weight loss occur. The bowel walls become markedly thickened and obstruction can result.When possible, surgical excision of affected tissue should be undertaken. Medical management with itraconazole or amphotericin B can be successful, although response rates are low.39.\nWhat is the prognosis with pythiosis?\nThe prognosis is generally guarded to poor unless affected tissues can be surgically excised with good margins.40.\nWhat GI signs are seen with histoplasmosis?\nHistoplasmosis can affect many organs; GI tract involvement is common. The disease results in weight loss, lethargy, and anorexia. Diarrhea is often seen; usually its characteristics indicate large-bowel involvement. Other clinical signs will depend on what other organs are affected.41.\nHow is GI histoplasmosis diagnosed?\nClinical signs, together with cytologic evidence of Histoplasma capsulatum organisms, are diagnostic. A rectal scrape can often be diagnostic in those cases of large-bowel diarrhea. Serologic results are considered unreliable.\n",

It is, however, important to remember that a negative fecal float test result does not rule out an infection and should never be a reason to not treat with a deworming agent.43.\nWhat roundworms are commonly found in dogs and how are they acquired?\nThe most commonly found roundworm is Toxocara canis. This can be acquired through the fecal-oral or transmammary route or in utero. Toxascaris leonina can also be found. It is acquired through the fecal-oral or transmammary route.44.\nWhat clinical signs are seen with roundworms?\nClinical signs are seen almost exclusively in puppies. Severe infestations can result in diarrhea, vomiting, poor nutritional status, and a potbelly. Obstruction can occur.45.\nAre roundworms a zoonotic concern?\nThe ingestion of roundworm eggs by humans can result in visceral larva migrans. This often does not lead to clinical signs, although in some cases blindness can occur.46.\nWhat hookworms are commonly found in dogs and how are they acquired?\nThe most common hookworm is Ancylostoma caninum. Additionally, Uncinaria stenocephala can be found. Hookworms are acquired either by the fecal-oral route or the transmammary route.47.\nWhat clinical signs are seen with hookworms?\nDiarrhea can occur with this disease. Significant blood and protein loss can also occur, resulting in weight loss, anemia, and hypoproteinemia.48.\nAre hookworms a zoonotic concern?\nHookworms can penetrate skin, resulting in dermal larva migrans. There also have been sporadic reports of intestinal disease in humans infected with canine hookworms.49.\nWhat role does Giardia play in canine diarrhea?\nThis parasite can be seen in dogs, though it occurs in dogs with and without diarrhea. Most infections are subclinical. In some cases severe diarrhea can develop.50.\nHow is Giardia diagnosed?\nThe Giardia cysts can be identified on a fecal float test. Motile trophozoites can be seen on fresh fecal smears. There are also highly sensitive fecal ELISA tests available that detect Giardia antigen.51.\nHow is Giardia treated?\nMetronidazole can be used to treat Giardia (25 mg/kg every 12 hours for 5 days). Prolonged use of the drug can result in central nervous system (CNS) disturbances. Fenbendazole is also highly effective in treating this parasite (50 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3 days). Albendazole is also effective; however, bone marrow toxicity has been seen with this drug. Bathing the dog is also recommended to help prevent reinfection.\n",

Food intolerance is based on a nonimmunologic reaction.53.\nWhat clinical signs are seen with adverse reactions to food?\nThe most common sign, especially with food intolerance, is vomiting or diarrhea. Food allergies can result in non-GI-tract signs such as pruritus and urticaria.54.\nHow is a food allergy diagnosed?\nTo diagnose a food allergy, an allergic reaction needs to be documented. This is generally clinically not possible.55.\nHow is an adverse reaction to food diagnosed?\nAn adverse reaction to food (allergy or intolerance) is diagnosed by means of an elimination diet and challenge. A diet is fed that does not contain elements that the dog has been previously exposed to. This is fed for a period of at least 12 weeks to see if symptoms subside. If the diet is successful, the dog is challenged with the previous diet to see if signs recur. If they do, the elimination diet is started again.\n",

The distribution can be focal or generalized. Many diseases can cause GI tract inflammation; however, with IBD, the inflammation is considered idiopathic.57.\nWhat clinical signs are seen with IBD?\nSigns will vary with the severity of inflammation. Diarrhea is the most common sign with intestinal IBD. Depending on where there is inflammation, the characteristics may be those of small-bowel, large-bowel, or mixed diarrhea. In severe cases anorexia and weight loss can occur, as well as excessive protein loss.58.\nHow do you diagnose IBD?\nIBD is diagnosed by means of intestinal biopsy.59.\nHow do you treat IBD?\nTreatment will vary somewhat depending on the type of inflammatory cells that predominate and the severity of clinical signs. Dietary modification is commonly used. In some cases food allergy is suspected, and in such cases it is common practice to use antigen limited diets. Alternatively, hydrolyzed diets can be used.Antibiotics such as metronidazole and tylosin are often used. This can help to treat SIBO (a common condition seen with IBD), which may be partly responsible for the clinical signs. Antibiotics may also change the flora of the GI tract, which might be beneficial if bacterial antigens are responsible for the inflammation.With IBD it is also common to give antiinflammatory or immune suppressive medications. Corticosteroids are among the most common therapies for IBD. In severe cases azathioprine or cyclosporine can also be considered. In cases of colitis, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) can be given. When combined with sulfapyridine, it is called sulfasalazine. In the colon bacteria split the sulfa from the 5-ASA, which can then have a local antiinflammatory effect in the colon.60.\nWhat is meant by eosinophilic enteritis?\nThis form of IBD is associated with an eosinophilic infiltrate or occasionally with peripheral eosinophilia. This form of IBD is generally more severe and its treatment is more difficult. Given the participation of eosinophils, parasites or allergies could be underlying causes.61.\nWhat is lymphocytic/plasmacytic IBD?\nThis is the most common form of IBD, with lymphocytes and plasma cells being the predominant intestinal infiltrate. In many cases it can be difficult to determine if a pathologic infiltrate is present because this type of change can be seen in many dogs without clinical signs of IBD. Severity of signs does not have to correlate with how marked the infiltrate is.62.\nWhat is histiocytic ulcerative colitis?\nThis is a form of IBD in which histiocytes predominate in the intestinal infiltrate. This form of colitis is especially severe and can result in significant weight loss. Ulcers are common, both macroscopically and microscopically.63.\nHow is histiocytic ulcerative colitis treated?\nPreviously, immune-suppressive drugs and sulfasalazine were used in treating this disease, although results were not consistently good. Recently treatment with enrofloxacin has resulted in a good response and long-term resolution of clinical signs.\n",

            "text": "\n64.\nWhat is a protein-losing enteropathy (PLE)?\nProtein-losing enteropathies are a diverse group of chronic intestinal disorders characterized by excessive loss of proteins into the GI tract. The most common causes are inflammatory bowel disease and lymphangiectasia, although protein loss can be seen with other GI tract diseases as well, such as neoplasia, parasitism in juvenile animals, and histoplasmosis. Protein loss can also occur acutely with severe exudative enteritis, for instance, with parvovirus infection. The loss of proteins is nonselective; so that both albumin and globulins will be decreased. Other differentials for hypoalbuminemia, such as protein-losing nephropathy or liver disease, usually are not associated with a dramatic decrease in globulins.65.\nWhat is lymphangiectasia?\nWith lymphangiectasia the lacteals and lymphatic vessels in the mucosa and or submucosa are dilated and can rupture. Proteins and other lymph components are then lost into the GI tract rather than being resorbed. Breeds with predispositions to lymphangiectasia include the Yorkshire Terrier, Norwegian Lundehund, and Soft-Coated Wheaten Terriers. The cause of this dilation is not always known; rare congenital cases do occur. In most cases the changes are acquired as a result of inflammation, which leads to obstruction of lymph flow. More severe cases will also have dilation of the mesenteric lymph vessels. Lymphangiitis, lymphadenitis, and lipogranulomas are often seen in more advanced cases.66.\nWhat laboratory abnormalities are seen with PLE?\nMany changes are nonspecific. Panhypoproteinemia (low globulin and low albumin concentrations) are often present. Decreased serum cholesterol concentrations and lymphopenia are also seen. Fecal concentrations of alpha1-protease can be helpful in documenting PLE.67.\nHow is a PLE treated?\nIn those cases where an underlying cause is found, this should be treated. Often if the cause of a PLE is inflammatory bowel disease, the response to glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications is good. If lymphangiectasia is present, treatment centers on dietary intervention. A highly digestible, low-fat, high-calorie diet is optimal. Reducing fat content decreases lymph flow. At one time supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) was recommended because it was thought that MCTs bypassed the lymphatics. Some recent work suggests that this is not the case. In addition, MCT oil generally is poorly palatable.\n",

The most common tumor in dogs is adenocarcinoma. These can occur in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Smooth-muscle tumors (leiomyosarcomas and leiomyomas) are the next most common tumors; they usually are located in the intestine.69.\nWhat is the prognosis for intestinal tumors?\nThe prognosis for adenocarcinomas is generally poor because surgical resection is rarely curative. On average, survival time is 6 months, though some dogs live longer. With smooth muscle cell tumors, the prognosis is better. Leiomyosarcomas are slow growing, so even if the tumor metastasizes, the survival time may be close to 2 years.\n",
