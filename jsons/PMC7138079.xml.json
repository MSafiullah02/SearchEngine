The gene order is 3\u2032 leader, nucleoprotein, virion protein (VP) 35 (VP35), VP40, glycoprotein, VP30, VP24, polymerase L protein, and 5\u2032 trailer.3 Four of these proteins\u2014nucleoprotein, VP30, VP35, and the polymerase L protein\u2014are associated with the viral genomic RNA in the ribonucleoprotein complex. The L protein and VP35 make up the polymerase complex, which transcribes and replicates the EBOV genome. The L protein provides the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the complex. This protein is an ideal target for antiviral interventions not only because its suppression should lead to a nearly complete loss of all RNA synthesis, but also because of the absence of similar proteins in mammalian cells. VP24 and VP35 are also promising targets for antiviral interventions since both have been shown to have inhibitory effects on the host type 1 interferon response. Specifically, VP35 functions as a type 1 interferon antagonist by blocking the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 and possibly preventing transcription of interferon \u03b2.4 Consistent with these findings, mutations of ZEBOV VP35 rendered an adapted virus avirulent in guineapigs.5 VP24 expression interferes with type 1 interferon signalling,6 and mutations in VP24 have been linked to adaptation by ZEBOV to produce a lethal infection in mice7 and guineapigs.8\n",

RNA interference represents a promising intervention for the treatment of diseases, including those caused by viruses. Indeed, RNA interference has been used in cell culture systems and rodents to inhibit the replication of several pathogens that cause disease in human beings. However, its usefulness as an effective treatment in non-human primate models of human infectious diseases has been assessed in only two studies.9, 10 Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) inhibited the replication of hepatitis GB virus B in a non-lethal marmoset surrogate model of human hepatitis C.9 siRNAs against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus inhibited the virus replication in a non-lethal rhesus monkey model.10 However, unmodified immune stimulatory siRNAs were used in both of these studies, potentially confounding the interpretation of the results. Until now, the usefulness of RNA interference as a postexposure treatment has not been assessed in a lethal model of a human infectious disease in non-human primates.",

Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Berthold luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany) were used to measure Renilla luciferase (fused to ZEBOV VP24 or ZEBOV VP35 transgene) and firefly luciferase signals.

The ZEBOV cocktail was not immune stimulatory at the limit of sensitivity of the assays used. These data and the 5\u2032RACE PCR data suggest that the antiviral effects in non-human primates are the result of specific RNA interference in reticuloendothelial cells and not due to immune stimulation or other off-target effects. Additionally, the death of the macaque given control Luc mod on day 10, which was within the normal range of expected time to death for historical untreated controls, also suggests that the ZEBOV-mediated protection was specific to the siRNAs and not related to off-target effects. When the immune toxicities associated with the siRNA component of SNALPs were abrogated through the use of selective chemical modification, the major remaining toxicity in mouse and non-human primate models was hepatotoxicity associated with the SNALP lipid components (MacLachlan I, unpublished). Preliminary tolerability studies in mice showed that seven daily doses of up to 4\u00b73 mg/kg (30\u00b70 mg/kg cumulative) of SNALPs containing ZEBOV siRNAs were well tolerated, corroborating the lack of hepatotoxicity (measured as increases in liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) in the treated macaques that survived infection.",

The rhesus macaque model that we used represents a worse-case scenario such as an accidental needle stick exposure of a laboratory worker or first responder to a high infectious dose of ZEBOV, which has occurred several times during the past 5 years.28, 29, 30 ZEBOV infection in human beings normally progresses slower than in macaques with case fatality rates in man ranging from 70\u201390%,1 suggesting that the therapeutic window could be larger than in experimentally infected macaques. Nonetheless, the focus in future studies will need to be on investigation of whether anti-ZEBOV siRNAs will be beneficial if administered at the onset of symptoms. Here, we show a substantial progress in the treatment of ZEBOV infections in non-human primates compared with previously described postexposure methods that afforded only partial protection of non-human primates against ZEBOV.19, 21, 22 To progress to license, studies will be done in guineapig and non-human primate models of ZEBOV infection in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration's guidelines for the assessment of treatments for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention category A threats (number 21CFR314.610). Additionally, studies will need to be done to obtain data about pharmacology, dosing, and toxicology in uninfected non-human primates.",
