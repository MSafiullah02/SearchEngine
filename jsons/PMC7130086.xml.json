Variables with P\n < 0.30 in the univariable analysis were considered for inclusion in multivariable logistic regression. Variables were selected for inclusion in the final model if they significantly improved the fit (likelihood ratio \u03c7\n2 statistic P\n < 0.05). Cross-tabulation and a Fisher's exact test were used to examine the association between presence of osteolysis on MRI and the diagnosis of neoplastic disease. Results of logistic regression and cross-tabulation are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis was performed to estimate median survival time (MST) with 95% CIs. Survival was determined from the date of diagnosis to the censor date of 15 November 2006. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to evaluate the effects of potential explanatory variables on survival. Variables with P\n < 0.30 in the univariable analysis were considered for inclusion in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Variables were selected for inclusion in the final model if they significantly improved the fit (likelihood ratio \u03c7\n2 statistic P\n < 0.05). Results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs. Significance was set at P\n < 0.05 for all final models. The proportionality assumption was checked for the Cox model and the residuals were examined as an assessment of the fit of the final models to the data.",

There were two independent predictors of survival: identification of abnormalities on MRI (P\n = 0.003) and speed of onset of clinical signs (P\n = 0.008). Cats with abnormal MRI findings had a greater hazard of death compared to cats with an unremarkable MRI, and cats with chronic or peracute onset of clinical signs had a significantly lower hazard of death compared with cats with an acute onset of clinical signs. Ten of the 11 cats that underwent euthanasia on the day of MRI had an abnormal MRI. When these cats were excluded from analysis, the same two variables were associated with survival: identification of abnormalities on MRI (P\n = 0.01) and speed of onset of clinical signs (P\n = 0.03) with similar HR.",

This finding is similar to those of the two previous studies that did not involve the use of MRI.12, 13 There are several pathological processes that may be undetectable on MRI, including inflammatory, vascular or degenerative diseases. This group of cats presents a tremendous diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic challenge. Further information on the cause(s) of spinal disease in this group of cats is evidently required. It is possible that the cats with abnormal CSF analysis, mainly the ones with pleocytosis, had underlying inflammatory diseases that remained undiagnosed. Some of these cats improved with antibiotic therapy, others with corticosteroid therapy, others deteriorated despite different treatment attempts and a last group improved without treatment. This suggests different underlying aetiologies that could not be diagnosed through the routinely available diagnostic procedures. In the cats with normal CSF findings, almost half of these cases (n\n = 6) had a history of trauma and most of them recovered without treatment raising the possibility of subtle lesions that could not be visualised on MRI. Another section of these cats deteriorated slowly over a period of months despite different treatment attempts, suggesting possible degenerative disease. Finally, the possibility of erroneous neurolocalisation and subsequent inappropriate diagnostic evaluation cannot be ruled out. None of the cats that did not improve was re-evaluated to investigate this possibility or to assess if the progression of the clinical signs could aid in the diagnostic process.",

This contrasts with previous studies that found inflammatory disease to be most common.12, 13 This may be related to geographic differences as both previous studies were performed in the USA, the fact that several of the feline inflammatory diseases can be diagnosed through serum titres and, therefore, these cats do not undergo advanced imaging or that a proportion of the cats with unremarkable MRI and abnormal CSF (n\n = 11) had inflammatory diseases that remained unidentified. Lymphoma was the most frequent neoplastic process diagnosed and this agrees with what has been previously reported.1, 2, 3, 15 A positive FeLV status has been implicated as the most important factor associated with feline lymphoid tumours.1, 2 In our study, although all 55 of the cats tested for FeLV were negative, only three of the seven cats diagnosed with lymphoma were tested. Due to this small number, no conclusions can be made about the relationship between FeLV and spinal lymphoma. Nonetheless, it is possible that the widespread use of the FeLV vaccination over the past decade could account for a suspected reduction of FeLV associated lymphoma cases.",

However, cats with severe clinical signs and the ones presenting with spinal pain were more likely to have abnormalities on MRI. Spinal pain is often caused by extradural compression of the spinal cord (eg, degenerative intervertebral disc disease), vertebral (eg, discospondylitis) or paraspinal lesions (eg, soft tissue abscess). Most of these lesions are easily identifiable on MRI and this may explain why abnormalities were more commonly found in the cats presenting pain. It also seems intuitive that animals with more severe clinical signs have a higher probability of having abnormalities detectable by MRI, wherever the causative lesion is located.",
