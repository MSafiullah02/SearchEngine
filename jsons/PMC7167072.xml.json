MERS CoV, OC43 CoV, HKU1 CoV, 229E CoV, and NL63 CoV have the same rhythm of average docking scores ranking. They show priority for IDX\u2010184, followed by MK\u20100608 and Ribavirin. On the other hand, SARS CoV shows priority for both MK\u20100608 and Ribavirin followed by IDX\u2010184. The average docking scores for SARS CoV and MERS CoV are better than that of HCV, suggesting potent inhibitory performance of IDX\u2010184 and MK\u20100608 against MERS CoV and SARS CoV as reported for HCV.",

Both HCV and MERS CoV polymerases forms coordination bonds through Mg+2 with GTP and this facilitates the binding.
