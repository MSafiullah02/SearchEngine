The homogeneous Poisson process was used to approximate the related processes between arsenic exposure and influenza-associated lung function exacerbation risk. We found that (i) estimated arsenic-induced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) reducing rates ranged from 0.116 to 0.179 mL/\u03bcg for age 15-85 years, (ii) estimated arsenic-induced A (H1N1) viral load increasing rate was 0.5 mL/\u03bcg, (iii) estimated A (H1N1) virus-induced FEV 1 reducing rate was 0.10 mL/logTCID50, and (iv) the relationship between arsenic exposure and A (H1N1)-associated respiratory symptoms scores (RSS) can be described by a Hill model. Here we showed that maximum RSS at day 2 postinfection for Taiwan, West Bengal (India), and the United States were estimated to be in the severe range of 0.83, 0.89, and 0.81, respectively, indicating that chronic arsenic exposure and A (H1N1) infection together are most likely to pose potential exacerbations risk of lung function, although a 50% probability of lung function exacerbations risk induced by arsenic and influenza infection was within the mild and moderate ranges of RSS at day 1 and 2 postinfection. We concluded that avoidance of drinking arsenic-containing water could significantly reduce influenza respiratory illness and that need will become increasingly urgent as the novel H1N1 pandemic influenza virus infects people worldwide.",

(20) reported that chronic arsenic poisoning from drinking arsenic-contaminated water was associated with pulmonary diseases in West Bengal (India), indicating that lung functions measured as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were averagely reduced 16.73%, 9.58%, and 19.91%, respectively, compared to controls. Von Ehrenstein et al. (18) reported that consumption of arsenic-contaminated water was associated with a high risk (odds ratios (ORs): 2.8-3.8) of respiratory symptoms and reduced FEV 1 and FVC based on a population-based investigation. Emerging evidence showed that long-term ingestion of inorganic arsenic may also lead to nonmalignant respiratory effects, implicating a strong inverse association between urinary arsenic and predictive FEV 1 , FVC, and FEV 1 /FVC. (21) Influenza epidemics pose a serious threat on morbidity and mortality on a global scale, with nearly 3-5 million cases of severe illness and a quarter to one-half a million deaths annually worldwide. (22) A number of influenza-related treats, showing evidence of seasonality, to both elderly and children in tropical and subtropical regions were identified. (23\u221226) The recent outbreak of novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza first emerged in Mexico in April 2009 and then spread worldwide, resulting in more than 130,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and 800 deaths in over 100 countries by mid-July of 2009. (27) The WHO reported that many areas around the world utilize drinking water supplies with arsenic levels in excess of 10 \u03bcg/L, including the United States, Mexico, and Southeast Asia. (28) Many geographic areas with confirmed human cases of avian flu or H1N1 include populations that also have elevated arsenic exposures. Therefore, it implies that arsenic exposures may exacerbate health outcomes related to influenza infections.",

Kozul et al. (36) revealed that mice ingesting arsenic in their drinking water on a daily basis at levels of 100 \u03bcg/L were initially unable to initiate a strong immune response to A (H1N1) influenza virus. They found that the arsenicexposed mice exhibited a significant 10-fold increase in viral loads (measured as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL)) compared with normal ones at day 7 postinfection. Therefore, it appears that arsenic exposure leads to increased susceptibility and severity of respiratory influenza A (H1N1) infection.",

Unlike the aforementioned epidemiological approaches, here we examined the linkage between exacerbations risk of respiratory influenza infections and chronic arsenic exposure from a riskbased mechanistic point of view. The current available data, however, do not provide detailed information of the association between arsenic exposure and influenza infection. The resulting uncertainty in arsenic-associated influenza infections thus poses a fundamental challenge to quantifying and modeling the linkage of arsenic and influenza. Researchers commonly account for uncertainty or lack of information through stochastic models. In this study, we addressed this challenge using the well-established statistics methods.",

A remarkable data set covering arsenic epidemiology of gender-specific and age-adjusted prevalence of arsenic-related respiratory symptoms in West Bengal (India) gave us the opportunity to test all theoretical considerations of arsenic exposure effects and quantify its strength. (14) The study by Guha Mazumder (14) is the first large population-based study with individual exposure data, providing critical information to characterize arsenic exposure-respiratory effect relationships. The data set was reanalyzed based on the cross-sectional survey conducted between April 1995 and March 1996 to reconstruct quantitatively the pooled arsenic epidemiological data of gender-and age-specific cumulative prevalence ratios. Water arsenic levels were obtained from 7,683 of the participants (4,093 females and 3,590 males). The 6,864 participants with nonsmokers (4,042 females and 2,822 males) were used to comprise the study populations for consideration of respiratory signs and symptoms (n = 6,864). Guha Mazumder and co-workers (14) used a standardized questionnaire to collect information, including sources of drinking water and sociodemographic characteristics. A physician interviewer also was involved in the investigation concerning the presence of respiratory problems. The outcomes analyzed included participant-reported cough, shortness of breath, and weakness, and the presence of chest sounds recorded by the examining physician. Each outcome was examined based on arsenic levels in the tubewell drinking water source used by each participant. The tubewells were categorized based on arsenic concentrations of <50, 50-199, 200-499, 500-799, and \u2265800 \u03bcg/L. The age groups of the participants in the survey ranged from \u2264 9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and \u2265 60 years.",

In their study, influenza infection was defined as nasal stuffiness, cough, sore throat, huskiness, throat injection, and headache with fever of >38 \u2022 C for at least 2 days during an influenza epidemic. Kondo and Abe (30) found an insignificant difference in the time course of FEV 1 of acute stage between influenza A and B infections, showing that 15 of 20 patients had a decrease in FEV 1 more than 20% from baseline during acute stage. Kondo and Abe (30) indicated that there were no significant differences in the timecourse of FEV 1 after different types of influenza infection. Therefore, the data of influenza A and B were used to represent influenza A (H1N1) infection. Meanwhile, previous studies (36, 37) showed that only influenza A (H1N1) data were available. Here, we focused only on the infection due to influenza A (H1N1) virus.",

Fig. 6 shows the synoptic predicted risk profiles for five representative regions of Taiwan, West Bengal (India), the United States, Mexico, and Brazil. The published data on arsenic concentrations in drinking water (40) and published viral loads at day 0, 1, and 2 postinfection (37) were adopted to generate the probability distributions. The probabilities of day-postinfection-dependent lung function exacerbations risk based on the estimated dose-response profile (Fig. 5(A) ) can then be estimated (Fig. 6 ). Here we used the difference between maximum and minimum RSS ( RSS = RSS max \u2212RSS min ) to indicate the potential exacerbations risk of lung function induced by chronic arsenic exposure and A (H1N1) infection (Table III) . It is not surprising that the regions of Taiwan, West Bengal (India), and the United States subjected to relatively higher arsenic levels in drinking water had larger changes in RSS at day 2 after infection compared with Brazil and Mexico. Meanwhile, RSS values in West Bengal and the United States ranged from 0.21 to 0.29 compared with Brazil and Mexico, which had less change in RSS of 0.07 and 0.12, respectively (Table III) .",

When combined with projections of exacerbations risk profiles and arsenic exposure scenarios, this arsenic exposure effect provides a coherent and alarming picture of increase in A (H1N1)-associated respiratory symptoms under chronic arsenic exposure through arseniccontaminated drinking water consumption.

            "text": "Many studies (14, 17, 18, 21) indicated that skin lesions and tobacco smoking might be affecting factors to arsenic-induced lung function decrement. So far we still do not fully understand the underlying mechanisms of how the other infectious respiratory diseases (like tuberculosis) affect the lung functions. Therefore, we recommended that the future research could focus on more evaluations of the interaction of arsenic with other interference factors or infectious respiratory diseases (like tuberculosis) commonly found in the arsenic prevalence areas. Looking forward, it is a vital health need to identify environmental risk factors that exacerbate influenza and possibly other respiratory infections, helping to minimize the impact of potential pandemic outbreaks in the future. It is thus needed to conduct more studies to determine the causal relationships of viruschemical interactions in water and human disease and to assess the role of other waterborne chemical carcinogens related to infectious diseases manifestation. (42\u221244) Our findings suggested that avoidance of drinking arsenic-containing water could reduce influenza respiratory illness and that need will become increasingly urgent as the novel H1N1 pandemic influenza virus infects people worldwide. (45, 46) In the present study, data gaps are the limitation of the model. The major assumption was that RSS estimates were strongly associated with FEV 1 decrements, viral loads, and arsenic exposure levels. The epidemiological data used in this study only considered arsenic-contaminated drinking-water-associated respiratory effects. However, people exposed to arsenic contaminations were also related to ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact pathways. The prediction might be underestimated in the present study. Furthermore, the different ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and food habits might be the plausible factors for RSS and arsenic accumulation capacities. Based on our model findings, the area-specific RSS could be predicted. Therefore, area-based disease impacts could be predicted and even forecasted. Therefore, we could effectively control the plausible impacts due to arsenic and viral infection. The implications of our proposed model might be initiated for risk management. First, our model concept could be used as a paradigm for heterogeneous stress co-exposure issues where the stress might include heavy metals and/or infectious virus. Second, our model structure might be useful for infection risk estimation if arsenic-associated infection probability is available. Last, our results might improve the current vaccine and chemoprophylaxis layout (or deployment).",

Input age (mean value) and stature, stature-and age-related predicted FEV 1 could be calculated accordingly. In the empirical formulas, we assumed that the stature of male is 1.70 m, and the FEV 1 of health participants is 100%. After arsenic exposure, one of the lung function indices, FEV 1 , would decline subsequently; thus the percent predicted FEV 1 could be obtained as FEV 1 (t, 0)/ FEV 1 (t, C)\u00d7100%.",
