The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 721,800 health care-acquired infections occurred in the United States in 2011, equating to about 1 hospital-acquired infection in every 25 inpatients.1 Organisms that are common causes of health care-associated infections are known to survive on surfaces for days to months.2 Environmental contamination has also been demonstrated to play a role in the transmission of pathogens, including viruses such as norovirus,3, 4 coronaviruses, and influenza,5 as well as bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.6, 7 Evidence indicates that contamination of environmental surfaces is linked with contamination of health care personnel hands and that improved terminal cleaning and disinfection practices lead to decreased infection rates.8, 9 Improving environmental cleaning and disinfection in health care settings therefore is a critical practice in reducing the incidence of health care-associated infections.",

Between 1997 and 2007, outpatient office visits increased by 25%.10 Between 1996 and 2013, outpatient care spending increased by $324.9 billion, whereas inpatient care spending increased by $259.2 billion,11 and in 2016, hospital care spending increased 4.7%, whereas outpatient services spending increased 5.4%.12 As more care is provided in outpatient facilities, it is increasingly important to understand the potential for disease transmission and study the practices that ensure infection prevention in this setting. Although disinfection interventions have been quantitatively evaluated in hospitals13, 14 and workplaces,15, 16 studies have not been published measuring their effect in health care facilities beyond hospitals, despite evidence of environmental contamination in outpatient care sites.17, 18 Understanding the dynamics of transmission and reservoirs of contamination in an outpatient setting can help inform effective infection control guidelines and practices. Previous studies in home and office environments demonstrated that human viruses and virus surrogates spread rapidly throughout a facility and may contaminate more than half of the surfaces within 4 hours.16, 19 Ethanol-based products, particularly those targeting hand hygiene, play a strong role in infection control because of rapid, broad-spectrum efficacy and ease of use. For surface disinfection, however, ethanol-based disinfectants have required high levels of alcohol (\u226550%) for antimicrobial efficacy, which led to concerns with fast dry times and material compatibility.9 The aim of this study was to quantify pathogen contamination potential and assess the impact of a high-touch point cleaning intervention with a 29.4% ethanol spray disinfectant on reducing the spread of a virus tracer in an outpatient clinic.",

Initial contamination of only 2 high-touch point surfaces (patient sign-in pen and common examination area exit door handle) resulted in spread to hands and fomites in both patient and restricted staff areas. Frequently touched surfaces, such as bathroom faucets, and patient room examination table sides and door handles had higher levels of contamination compared with less frequently touched items, such as canisters storing cotton swabs and other medical supplies in patient rooms. Contamination levels did decrease on sampled fomites and hands over the course of the day. Possible explanations for the decrease are that the tracer continues to be transferred to fomites not included in sampling and is transported out of the facility on the hands of exiting patients, reducing the numbers on the sampled areas. Additionally, the sampling itself at each time point reduces the available virus for transfer. In reality, it is likely that as patients who are ill or colonized with a pathogen visit the facility throughout the day, they will continually shed pathogens and contaminate surfaces.",

CDC guidelines for prevention of Clostridium difficile, for example, include the supplemental use of specific EPA-approved, spore-killing disinfectants where patients with C difficile are treated.

Thus we recommend that site staff be more intentional about surface disinfection practices throughout the workday.
