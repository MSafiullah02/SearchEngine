The conditioning regimen consisted of 3.2 mg/kg busulfan for 4 days and 30 mg/m2 fludarabine for 5 days. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of 0.03mg/kg tacrolimus and short\u2010term methotrexate. Rapid engraftment was observed, and chimerism analysis demonstrated that 89% of whole blood cells were donor derived by Day +29 after BMT. Marrow aspiration on Day +53 revealed no blasts, confirming complete remission. No acute GVHD signs or symptoms were observed.",

Concurrent lineage\u2010specific chimerism analysis demonstrated that only 10.5% of CD3+ cells were donor\u2010derived cells, although 73.5% of CD3\u2013 mononuclear cells (MNCs) and more than 95% of granulocytes were donor derived. Based on these findings, tacrolimus was tapered off and then discontinued; however, neither recovery of donor\u2010derived CD3+ cells nor GVHD symptoms were observed. Approximately 1 month after discontinuation of the immunosuppressant, DLI (CD3+ dose of 4.5 \u00d7 106/kg recipient body weight) was performed from the same donor on Day +193 after allo\u2010BMT. On Day 14 after DLI, the patient complained of spontaneous itchy and dry skin, with eruption on the face suspected to be GVHD. The skin eruption continued until Day 42 without progression and improved without treatment by Day 50. On Day 56, the patient complained of very mild dyspnea with a low\u2010grade fever, which gradually worsened until Day 60. Chest radiography on Day 62 showed diffuse shadows in both lower lung fields. Chest computed tomography (CT) on Day 63 revealed diffuse, bilateral, ground glass opacity and reticular appearance predominantly in the lower lung fields (Fig. 1A). Pulmonary function tests showed a decline in forced vital capacity, from 3.21 L to 1.98 L, as well as in percentage of vital capacity from 128% to 80% and almost no change (78% to 80%) in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), indicating restrictive lung dysfunction. On Day 78, fiber optic bronchoscopy and a bronchoalveolar lavage were performed. Due to the small sample, histologic findings of the transbronchial lung biopsy only showed trivial alveolar edema without evidence of leukemia infiltration; the specimen did not include bronchiole for differential diagnosis of COP/BOOP or for identification of the BO as chronic GVHD. Analysis of the BALF showed a total cell count of 3.4 \u00d7 105 cells/mL, with differential cell counts of 36% macrophages, 63% lymphocytes, and 1% granulocytes. Of the lymphocytes, 98% were CD3+ T cells, and the CD4/8 ratio was 1.72 (CD4, 62.4%; CD8, 36.3%). Bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures of the BALF were negative. A cytomegalovirus antigenemia test was also negative. The BALF was also shown to be negative for influenza A (including subtypes H1 and H3), influenza B, RSV A and B, HMPV, PIV 1\u20104, coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus by a respiratory viral panel fast assay (Luminex xTAG, Luminex Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada). Based on these findings, we diagnosed NIPC induced by DLI. On Day 88, prednisolone (PSL) was administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day, which led to rapid clinical improvement. The follow\u2010up CT 12 days after initiation of PSL treatment showed remarkable improvement of the abnormal shadows (Fig. 1B). The PSL dose was tapered off and discontinued 9 months after onset, without recurrence of NIPC.",

On the other hand, DLI may induce severe adverse effects, including severe GVHD. When our patient complained of dyspnea with fever, we suspected that the complication was pulmonary GVHD by alloreactive donor T cells recognizing alloantigens. Previous studies have suggested that infused lymphocytes lead to lung injury in murine GVHD models, although the lungs have not been generally considered a classic target organ of acute GVHD.12, 13, 14 To clarify whether NIPC of the patient was pulmonary GVHD induced by infused donor lymphocytes, we performed chimerism analysis of T cells in the BALF and demonstrated that the cells recruited to the patient's lung were not exclusively derived from donor T cells. These results suggested that the pathogenesis of DLI\u2010induced NIPC was not due to attack by donor\u2010derived cytotoxic T cells directly recognizing the patient's pulmonary tissue, but by migrated patient T cells that were activated after DLI.",
