In fact, job affect and job satisfaction have been linked to various indicators of physiological functioning such as blood pressure, cortisol, cholesterol, and cytokines (Amati, 2010; Ilies et al., 2010; Matthews et al., 1987; Shirom et al., 2009). Impaired worker SWB, through its influence on physiological processes and subsequently on individual and societal health, produces a huge physical and financial burden for individuals and societies. Growing evidence that SWB influences health and other societal outcomes has led the United Nations to establish an International Day of Happiness to emphasize the importance of societal SWB as a key public policy objective (Diener and Tay, 2012; The United Nations, 2013).",

Historically, these two traditions have employed distinct but complementary theoretical models to understand the antecedents of SWB and physiological functioning. Occupational stress models (e.g. the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model; Demerouti et al., 2001) have historically emphasized the disease model of health, highlighting the effects of negative job conditions on strain and impaired physical and psychological health, and positive psychology models (e.g. the Broaden-and-Build theory of positive emotions; Fredrickson, 2001) have focused on the health-enhancing role of positive emotions and positive resources such as social support and resilience. As such, the combination of these two traditions can generate complementary insights on the linkage between SWB and physiological health outcomes. However, to date, no theoretical framework has integrated the complementary perspectives from these two traditions on the relationship between worker SWB and physiological health outcomes. This article fills this gap by providing a broad integrative framework on the relationship between worker SWB and physiological outcomes, drawing primarily from the Broaden-and-Build theory of positive emotions and the JD-R model.",

Growing concern about employee health has energized a search for modifiable antecedents of the proximal processes (i.e. physiological functioning) influencing employee health. Highlighting the need for research on employee health, the Center for Disease Control recently reported that \u201cproductivity losses related to personal and family health problems cost U.S. employers $1,685 per employee per year, or $225.8 billion annually\u201d (Stewart et al., 2003). These losses manifest in a variety of forms, including absenteeism, reduced performance, turnover-related training costs, disability losses, and high health insurance costs (Goetzel et al., 2003, 2004; Stewart et al., 2003). Lost productivity can exert tremendous social and financial burdens on society as a whole. As a result, large-scale programs such as the Total Worker Health initiative have emerged, focusing on integrative approaches to improve employee health (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2013).",

Theoretical approaches to measure worker SWB reflect the model used in the broader psychological sciences. In the organizational sciences, measures of job satisfaction are typically understood to capture primarily the cognitive aspects of SWB, whereas measures of job affect primarily capture the affective aspects of SWB (Kaplan et al., 2009). Multi-dimensional measures of job satisfaction include dimensions such as satisfaction with work, supervisor, colleagues, pay, communication, and promotion (Job Descriptive Index (JDI); Smith et al., 1969). Indices of affective well-being at work include measures of frequent positive emotions and infrequent negative emotions in the work context. Popular measures include the Positive and Negative Affective Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988) and the Job-related Affective Well-Being Scale (Van Katwyk et al., 2000). Evidence that measures of job affect and job satisfaction are related but distinct comes from recent meta-analytic findings showing moderate correlations between measures of worker affect and job satisfaction, ranging from an uncorrected magnitude of .26 to .34 (Kaplan et al., 2009).",

Compelling evidence for the influence of evaluations on feelings comes from the cognitive behavioral tradition, which holds that cognitive reactions to or interpretations of events drive affective reactions and subsequent behaviors. By learning to change default interpretations or evaluations of events, individuals are able to reduce undesired emotions and behaviors. The documented effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy in modifying a range of undesirable emotions (e.g. anger; Beck and Fernandez, 1998; anxiety; Hofmann and Smits, 2008) provides support for positing a causal path from cognitive SWB (i.e. job satisfaction) to affective SWB (i.e. feelings).",

Endocrine functioning is indexed by different hormones such as catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine), cortisol, and prolactin. Higher levels of such hormones are often diagnostic of poorer health. Immune functioning is indexed by circulating concentrations of immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and T cells; by the functional capacities of those cells; and by proteins produced by immune cells known as cytokines. Generally, greater numbers of immune cells are related to better immune response and more robust protection against diseases (Herbert and Cohen, 1993). High levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines can also indicate better immune function (Herbert and Cohen, 1993). Given these specific physiological indicators, if SWB at work is related to better physiological functioning, we would generally expect that SWB would be negatively related to cardiovascular and endocrine indicators, but positively related to most immune indicators.",

A key goal of research in the occupational stress tradition is to identify important negative work conditions and to advance theory explaining how and when these conditions harm worker health and well-being with the goal of developing and promoting interventions that protect workers against these negative conditions. Some of the most prominent theories in this tradition include the Demand-Control Model (Karasek, 1979), the person-environment fit model (French et al., 1982), the Transactional Model of Stress (Lazarus, 1999), and the Job-Demands Resources Model (Demerouti et al., 2001).",

Research in the positive psychology tradition is relatively new compared to research in the occupational stress tradition, and fewer theoretical frameworks have developed. Currently, a leading theoretical framework relevant to the current topic is the Broaden-and-Build theory of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 2001), which delineates health-enhancing benefits of positive emotions and positive resources such as social support and resilience. Because research in the occupational stress tradition and the positive psychology tradition both provide important findings relevant to the link between SWB and physiological functioning, yet do so through the distinct approaches of protecting workers from negative work conditions (in the case of occupational stress) and promoting positive emotions and resources (in the case of positive psychology), they represent complementary perspectives, which can be integrated to form a more holistic understanding of the relationship between SWB and physiological functioning.",

Because positive emotions generate opposite effects on awareness than negative emotions, which are known to narrow rather than broaden awareness, they serve as an antidote to the cardiovascular effects of negative emotions. Negative emotions are known to increase cardiovascular reactivity, which, if experienced frequently, can lead to heart disease and cardiac events (Kubzansky and Kawachi, 2000). An important determinant of whether frequent cardiovascular reactivity becomes harmful is how quickly individuals return to baseline levels of cardiovascular functioning after events that increase reactivity. Research has shown that individuals experiencing positive emotions have a speedier recovery from the cardiovascular effects of negative emotions than individuals who do not experience positive emotions (Fredrickson and Levenson, 1998). This benefit of positive emotions is referred to in the Broaden-and-Build framework as the undoing hypothesis. The key point of the undoing hypothesis is that positive emotions protect physiological health by undoing the effects of negative emotions.",

However, because of the proposed bi-directional relationship between job satisfaction and job affect, we do expect a link between job satisfaction and physiological functioning. As shown in the model, evaluations of one\u2019s job likely influence feelings in the workplace and, as such, have a distal influence on physiological functioning via positive and negative feelings.

Research has also found that stressful work characteristics are related to negative job evaluations and feelings, including job dissatisfaction and emotional exhaustion (Dollard and Winefield, 1998). Experience sampling research using worker samples has demonstrated that stressful events are related to experiences of greater negative feelings (Teuchmann et al., 1999; Van Eck et al., 1998; Zohar, 1999).

Much of the research in the occupational stress tradition has emphasized the link between job conditions and physiological functioning\u2014with work stress being the posited, but often not explicitly measured, link between these conditions and physiological outcomes. Research has shown that job conditions such as high job demands and low job control influence physiological outcomes such as cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure (Gallo et al., 2004; Kunz-Ebrecht et al., 2004). Despite the relatively low number of studies documenting the link between work stress and measures of worker physiological functioning (e.g. Almadi et al., 2012), compelling evidence for the influence of stress on SWB has been shown by employee stress management interventions. A meta-analysis on the effectiveness of employee stress management interventions revealed that such interventions enhance physiological functioning (d = .29; Richardson and Rothstein, 2008). Furthermore, the effects of work stress on the disease endpoints proximally influenced by physiological functioning, and the biological processes by which poor physiological functioning leads to diseases, have been clearly documented (Miller et al., 2007).",

A central tenet of the JD-R model is that negative job conditions (i.e. job demands) cause stress (Link 4), which subsequently harms well-being and health (Links 5 and 6), whereas positive job conditions (i.e. job resources) generate personal resources (Link 9), which enhances well-being and protects health (Links 7 and 11). These two predictions have garnered strong support (Schaufeli and Taris, 2014). Negative job conditions, specifically job demands, evoke negative employee reactions, particularly in the form of job dissatisfaction and negative feelings, whereas positive job resources lead to positive reactions, including job satisfaction and positive feelings. For instance, workers who reported job demands in the form of high safety risk perceptions were less satisfied with their jobs than workers who did not report high safety risks. In contrast, workers who reported positive job resources in the form of a positive safety climate had higher levels of job satisfaction than workers who did not report a positive safety climate (Nielsen et al., 2011).",

Feelings of stress and anxiety are characterized by high activation and negative valence (Russell, 1980). While such feelings are a common response to negative job characteristics, they are likely not the only affective response evoked by negative job characteristics and work events (Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996). For instance, interpersonal conflict at work or role overload may cause individuals to feel sad or disappointed, in addition to feeling stressed. Such low-activation negative emotions reflect a possible linkage between job conditions and SWB that is not mediated by stress. Link 12 in Figure 1 shows the direct influence of job conditions on SWB that is prompted by job conditions that evoke low-activation negative emotions.",

This integration is crucial because examining the relationship from only one of these perspectives omits important causal paths and potential confounding factors. For instance, the occupational stress perspective focuses on the effects of work conditions and the personal and organizational factors that mitigate the effects of those job conditions on both SWB and health. However, by omitting the direct influence of SWB on physiological functioning, the effects of factors such as job conditions and work stress may be overestimated. In contrast, by focusing primarily on the mechanisms linking positive emotions and health, the positive psychological perspective is limited because of a lack of consideration of the broader factors confounding the relationship between SWB and physiological functioning such as job conditions and work stress. Our model provides a framework for incorporating the important perspectives of each approach such that no key confounding factors are omitted.",

Because of this risk, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (2013) has emphasized the importance of approaches that seek to simultaneously address organization-level and individual-level causes of negative experiences. Furthermore, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (2013) has provided compelling evidence that workers are most likely to benefit from individual health-promotion interventions when the relevant organization-level features are simultaneously addressed.

Initial research appears to support the matching principle, particularly for emotional and physical stressors (De Jonge and Dormann, 2006). Because personal resources, as conceptualized in our article, are largely emotional, personal resource interventions may be most effective when used in contexts involving emotional stressors (e.g. emotional labor). As such, future research should examine whether the type of stressor is a boundary condition on our integrative model or whether personal resources can buffer the effects of stress on the SWB and health of workers even when the stress is primarily cognitive or physical in nature.",
