However, the role of adaptive immune cells in this disease is less well defined. It has been suggested that T lymphocytes, especially CD4+ T cells, contribute to the progression of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases13. Recently, lymphocytes have drawn increased attention, and there is accumulating evidence indicating that CD4+ T lymphocytes play important roles in the development and progression of ALI/ARDS.

            "text": "CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Treg is a critical sub-population of CD4+ T cells that is essential for maintaining self tolerance and preventing autoimmunity, for limiting chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease, and for regulating homeostatic lymphocyte expansion27. A recent report by D\u2019Alessio and coauthors15 investigated the role of lymphocytes in lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI. Their study showed that Treg depletion in wild-type mice delayed recovery, whereas Treg transfer into lymphocyte-deficient mice corrected the elevated levels of alveolar proinflammatory cytokines and increased the diminished transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and neutrophil apoptosis. In this study, we observed that CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Treg in peripheral blood was markedly decreased at 24 h after smoke inhalation. Our result is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that mice with chronic cigarette smoke exposure showed significant decrease in Treg prevalence in peripheral blood and Treg-related cytokine such as IL-1028. Generally, Tregs are supposed to play an anti-inflammatory role mainly by contact-dependent suppression, consumption of limiting T cell growth factors such as IL-2 or releasing inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 on other immune cells, including CD4+ T cells1329. Similarly, we found that CD4+ T cells were increased in peripheral blood of rats in response to smoke inhalation, which is consistent with lower percentage of Tregs. Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells differentiate into distinct functional subsets according to the local cytokine environment. The development of both Tregs and Th17 cells requires TGF-\u03b2, whereas IL-2 and IL-6 are key regulators interfering with differentiation of Treg and Th17 from naive T cells3031. TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2 are essential for the development of Tregs32. IL-2 maintains Foxp3+ Tregs33 and inhibits the polarization of Th17 cells34. IL-6 suppresses Treg differentiation35; in contrast, Th17 differentiation is initiated by IL-6 together with TGF-\u03b236. From our study, we found that gunpowder smog inhalation decreased IL-2 level in BALF and serum of rats. This result can explain the lower percentage of Tregs and the higher percentage of Th17 cells observed in rats with smoke inhalation. Moreover, Treg may attempt to resolve inflammation by producing IL-10, which is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the synthesis of many inflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b237. As a novel identified inhibitory cytokine, IL-35 is specifically produced by Tregs and is required for maximal suppressive activity38. Our results showed that both IL-10 and IL-35 were decreased in BALF and serum of rats after smoke inhalation, which are consistent with lower percentage of Tregs after smoke inhalation. Notably, research showed that Th2 responses inhibit TGF-\u03b2-induced Foxp3 expression and the formation of Tregs394041. We found that gunpowder smog induced the Th1/Th2 imbalance favoring a Th2 shift. Thus, the decreased Tregs in rats with smoke inhalation are partly attributed to decreased level of IL-2 and enhanced Th2 immunity. Inconsistent with our study, an earlier report has shown that Treg percentage in peripheral blood was significantly higher in patients with ARDS than in control group21. The difference may be largely due to different study groups, limited scale of ARDS subjects, the course of the disease and methods for detecting Treg. Indeed, ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome that can occur as a result of multiple insults and diseases. Despite of a common end state, it is noteworthy that ARDS between pulmonary and extrapulmonary may differ in morphology and respiratory physiology as well as response to therapeutic interventions42.",

            "text": "As a more recently discovered effector subset of CD4+ T cells, Th17 cell plays a key role in defense against extracellular pathogens, and promotes many autoimmune inflammatory diseases13. A recent study showed that the peripheral circulating Th17 cells and their associated cytokines increased in patients with early ARDS and may conduce to ARDS21. In our study, Th17 cells in peripheral blood were increased in rats with smoke inhalation, implying the possibility that Th17-mediated immune response is involved in the pathogenesis of smoke inhalation-induced acute lung injury. We also found that the changes of IL-17A were consistent with the change tendency of Th17 cells. As a predominant product and key effector molecule of Th17 cells, IL-17A appears to play a pivotal role in promoting activation and recruitment of leukocyte such as neutrophils and macrophages at lung or airway inflammation4344454647. In addition, IL-17-deficient mice have an impaired neutrophilic response to allergen48. It may partly explain the increase of neutrophils and macrophages in BALF from rats with smoke inhalation in our study. The differentiation and development of Th17 cell are determined by the microenvironment. TGF-\u03b2, IL-6, IL-23 and IL-1\u03b2 are all involved in the differentiation of human Th17 cells but IL-1\u03b2 is not needed in mouse4950. TGF-\u03b2 alone induces the differentiation into Tregs, but in an IL-1- and/or IL-6-rich inflammatory milieu, the Th17 generation is enhanced while the Tregs are suppressed51. In the present study, both TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 were increased in serum and BALF of rats with smoke inhalation, which may inhibit the generation of TGF-\u03b2-induced Tregs and promote a pro-inflammatory T-cell response predominated by Th17 cells. IL-23 appears to be essential to expand and maintain Th17 cells and plays a crucial role in the establishment and maintenance of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Research has shown that IL-23 was increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease52. In this study, the concentration of IL-23 was increased in serum and BALF of rats with smoke inhalation. Taken together, gunpowder smog inhalation promotes pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-23, thereby promoting differentiation, development and maintenance of Th17 cells.",

Moreover, certain proinflammatory milieu could convert differentiated Tregs into Th17 cells51. Thus, the balance between Th17 and Treg may be critical for maintenance of immune homeostasis. In fact, the balance between Th17 and Treg response has been suggested as a new paradigm for a number of inflammation and autoimmune diseases13. In the present study, the Th17/Treg ratio was markedly increased in peripheral blood of rats after smoke inhalation, indicating that the proinflammatory environment in rats with smoke inhalation was in favor of the generation of Th17 cells relative to Tregs. Moreover, a recent study revealed a previously unexpected role of adaptive immune responses that increase alveolar permeability in ARDS53. Similarly, our findings suggest that Th17/Treg imbalance contributes to increased alveolar epithelial permeability. Histological findings also showed that interstitial inflammation and lung injury were more severe in response to smoke inhalation. Taken together, these findings indicate that Th17/Treg imbalance in favor of a proinflammatory Th17-response is likely to be involved in the immune pathogenesis of smoke inhalation-induced acute lung injury. Further studies on the functional link of Th17/Treg imbalance to the disease pathogenesis using knock-out strategies or neutralizing antibodies may be beneficial for clinical management of smoke inhalation-induced acute lung injury that accounts for extensive morbidity and mortality.",

To determine the phenotypes of Th1/Th2/Th17 cells in whole blood and lung tissue of rats, 20 ng/mL PMA and 500 ng/mL ionomycin in the presence of 2.5 \u03bcg/mL brefeldin A (BFA; ENZO Alexis-Biomol, USA) were used to stimulate cytokine expression of Th1/Th2/Th17 cells for 5 h. CD3+ CD8\u2212 T cells were used to delimitate CD4+ T cells as CD4 is down-modulated when cells are activated by PMA. The cells were surface-stained with PerCP-eF710-labeled anti-rat CD3 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-rat CD8 antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) for 30 min, and then fixed and permeabilized using Fix&Perm Reagent (Invitrogen, USA).
