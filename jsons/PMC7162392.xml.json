            "text": "To ensure efficient replication, influenza viruses hijack factors of the host cell signalling machinery that are actually activated by the cell as a defence mechanism to fight the invader (Ludwig et al., 2006; Ludwig, 2007). With regard to antiviral events, signalling pathways that control induction of antiviral cytokines such as type I interferons (IFN \u03b1/\u03b2) are induced, providing a first line of defence to viral infections. One way to counteract these responses is the expression of the viral non\u2010structural protein 1 (NS1) that suppresses the IFN response by both, interfering with signalling inducers and mediators (Garcia\u2010Sastre, 2004; Wolff et al., 2008), and by inhibiting processing of cellular pre\u2010mRNA (reviewed in Krug et al., 2003). Thereby, the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and cytokine induction is kept in a tolerable limit (reviewed in Hale et al., 2008a). Based on these functions A/NS1 is primarily known as a signalling blocker. Influenza B viruses also express an NS1 (B/NS1). While A/NS1 and B/NS1 share less than 20% sequence identity, they fulfil similar but not identical functions. B/NS1 also acts as an IFN antagonist (Talon et al., 2000; Garcia\u2010Sastre, 2004) and inhibits the IFN inducible protein kinase R (Dauber et al., 2004; 2006). In contrast to A/NS1, B/NS1 is not capable to inhibit polyadenylation, splicing and nuclear export of cellular mRNA (Wang and Krug, 1996).",

PI3K was initially described to act in an antiviral fashion (Sarkar et al., 2004; Ehrhardt et al., 2006). However, later it became obvious that PI3K/Akt signalling is also actively induced by the viral A/NS1 protein to support efficient replication (Ehrhardt et al., 2006; 2007a; Hale et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2007a; Zhirnov and Klenk, 2007).",

Recently, the mTOR kinase associated with rictor (rapamycin\u2010insensitive companion of mTOR) and the small G\u03b2\u2010like protein G\u03b2L have been identified to build the mTORC2 complex that is responsible for phosphorylation at Ser473 (Sarbassov et al., 2005). Although Akt is not phoshorylated directly by PI3K, these post\u2010translational modifications occur strictly dependent on PI3K activity.

In general, PI3K regulates various cellular events, such as cell metabolism, proliferation and survival (reviewed in Neri et al., 2002; Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2005). Here, only some regulatory key players involved in PI3K signalling are discussed (Fig. 1). A vivid cross\u2010talk between PI3K/Akt\u2010mTOR and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling is crucial to regulate cell differentiation and survival (Carracedo and Pandolfi, 2008). Regulation of endocytosis and vesicular trafficking via Rac1 activation are further functions described for PI3K that are required for ligand internalization (Saeed et al., 2008). PDK1 activates, in addition to Akt, several other AGC protein kinase family members (cAMP, cGMP, Ca2+\u2010dependent), such as p70 S6 kinase and protein kinase C to control vesicular transport and translation (Kikani et al., 2005). Regulation of apoptosis is also an important function ascribed to PI3K/Akt. Activated Akt has been reported to inactivate proapoptotic factors such as BAD, caspase\u20109 and glycogen synthase kinase\u20103\u03b2 (GSK\u20103\u03b2) by phosphorylation. Akt also acts as a co\u2010regulator of transcription factors, such as NF\u2010\u03baB, leading to the synthesis of antiviral acting proteins, such as IFN regulatory factor I and MHC class I proteins or anti\u2010apoptotic Bcl\u20102 family members (Bcl\u20102 and Bcl\u2010XL) (Cooray, 2004).",

Among the phosphatases, PTEN (phosphatase of tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is likely to be the most important enzyme to control the PI3K pathway activity (Fig. 1). PTEN harbours protein as well as lipid phosphatase activities. It dephosphorylates phosphoinositides in position 3\u2032 of the inositol ring (Maehama and Dixon, 1998). The levels of PTEN and its activity are positively and negatively regulated on transcriptional, as well as on post\u2010translational level by phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, oxidation and acetylation (reviewed in Tamguney and Stokoe, 2007). The most prominent PI3K/Akt\u2010induced feedback regulator is the mTOR kinase, which forms complexes with raptor (regulatory\u2010associated protein of mTOR) \u2013 mTORC1 (Hara et al., 2002) and rictor (rapamycin\u2010insensitive companion of mTOR) \u2013 mTORC2 (Sarbassov et al., 2004). Hyperphosphorylation of mTORC1, for exmaple, by loss of PTEN, results in repression of PI3K whereas inhibition of mTORC1 leads to PI3K activation (Carracedo and Pandolfi, 2008).",

Thus, the role of PI3K was studied in the context of survival during chronic and latent infections (Cooray, 2004). The viral LMP1 protein of Epstein\u2010Barr virus regulates B\u2010cell survival, the viral E5 protein of Papillomavirus functions as an apoptosis supressor in epithelial cells and the viral HBx protein of Hepatitis B viruses inhibits TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells (Cooray, 2004).

HCV belongs to the family of Flaviviridae. The virus has a single\u2010stranded RNA genome with positive orientation (Lemon et al., 2007). Initially, the non\u2010structural protein 5 A (NS5A) of HCV was shown to induce p85 phosphorylation by complex\u2010formation with Grb2\u2010associated binder 1 (He et al., 2002), a substrate of the epidermal growth factor receptor. These results have been extended by observations that NS5A directly binds to the src homology (SH) 3 domain of p85. Binding is mediated by a proline\u2010rich motif in the NS5A protein and results in activation of the kinase (Street et al., 2004). Investigation of downstream factors of Akt indicated a NS5A\u2010induced regulation of the Forkhead transcription factor FKHR and GSK\u20103\u03b2 and accumulation of cellular beta\u2010catenin. This results in stimulation of beta\u2010catenin\u2010responsive transcription, which is probably involved in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (Street et al., 2005). Furthermore, the induction of the PI3K/Akt\u2010mTOR signalling upon HCV infection was reported to control cell survival, and thereby also determines apoptosis (Mannova and Beretta, 2005).",

The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) manipulates PI3K activity to ensure virus replication by prevention of apoptosis, although a viral product responsible for PI3K induction has not been specified (Cooray, 2004). First, RSV was shown to regulate NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010transcriptional activity dependent on PI3K/Akt. In addition, RSV infection caused enhanced apoptosis upon PI3K inhibition (Thomas et al., 2002). Recent investigations showed that RSV decreases p53 expression, thereby extending survival of the infected cells (Groskreutz et al., 2007). P53 is a tumour suppressor and induces expression of pro\u2010apoptotic factors. The murine double minute protein 2 is a p53 antagonist, which is phosphorylated by Akt upon RSV infection and leads to p53 degradation (Groskreutz et al., 2007). In influenza virus\u2010infected cells p53\u2010dependent apoptosis is induced at late stages of infection, but murine double minute protein 2 upregulation was not detected (Zhirnov and Klenk, 2007).",

Inhibition of PI3K/Akt suppressed infection by Ebola virus at an early step during virus replication (Saeed et al., 2008).

Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K or blocking of its effector PIP3 results in a misphosphorylation of IRF\u20103 and impaired transcriptional activation of the IFN\u03b2 promoter (Ehrhardt et al., 2006). These results corresponded with earlier findings that PI3K is involved in phosphorylation and activation of IRF\u20103 in response to TLR3 engagement upon double\u2010stranded RNA stimulation (Sarkar et al., 2004). Interestingly, this occurred independent of the IRF\u20103 kinases, Tank\u2010binding\u2010kinase\u20101 or I\u03baB kinase epsilon. Thus, it was suggested that coactivation of IRF\u20103 most likely is mediated by phosphorylation of a different target phosphorylation site on IRF\u20103 (Sarkar et al., 2004). Consequently, these observations indicate for an alternative PI3K\u2010dependent signalling mechanism besides the canonical RIG\u2010I/Tank\u2010binding\u2010kinase\u20101/I\u03baB kinase epsilon/IRF\u20103 signalling module that is required for full activation of IRF\u20103 in influenza virus\u2010infected cells.",

Initially, it was not clear which cellular or viral components activate PI3K late in the infection cycle. First evidence on the activating mechanism resulted from observations that PI3K is barely activated at later stages of infection in cells infected with the deltaNS1 virus, a virus mutant that lacks the IFN antagonistic A/NS1 protein (Ehrhardt et al., 2006). This was a surprising finding, as signalling pathways usually were found to be hyperactivated upon infection with deltaNS1. Hence, it was suggested that the A/NS1 protein acts as an efficient and broad signalling suppressor. The absence of PI3K activation in deltaNS1\u2010infected cells led to the intriguing conclusion that A/NS1 itself may induce PI3K\u2010mediated signalling (Ehrhardt et al., 2006). This hypothesis was subsequently verified by four independent studies, which showed that the A/NS1 protein is required and sufficient for activation of the kinase (Hale et al., 2006; Ehrhardt et al., 2007a; Shin et al., 2007a; Zhirnov and Klenk, 2007). Furthermore, it was demonstrated by different technical approaches that A/NS1 is complexed with the regulatory subunit p85, an event that probably leads to activation of PI3K (Hale et al., 2006; Ehrhardt et al., 2007a; Shin et al., 2007a).",

Thus, p85\u03b2 is most likely the only direct binding subunit of A/NS1. Within p85\u03b2, its SH3 domain and to a lesser extent the C\u2010terminal SH2 domain appeared to be required for interaction with the viral protein (Shin et al., 2007a).

This second SH3 binding motif is conserved in NS1 proteins of a number of avian influenza A viruses but with a few exceptions, not in human influenza A virus strains. Binding\u2010disruption of Crk and A/NS1 resulted in reduced PI3K activity (Heikkinen et al., 2008), indicating that Crk or CrkL are crucial cofactors for A/NS1\u2010mediated PI3K activation, at least in the case of avian influenza strains. While the formation of a large \u2018signalosome\u2019 of Crk/CrkL\u2010p110/p85\u2010A/NS1 was hypothesized (Heikkinen et al., 2008), the precise role of the complex\u2010formation between avian A/NS1 and Crk/CrkL in PI3K induction is not resolved and PI3K\u2010independent functions of the interaction should also be considered (Hale et al., 2008a).",

The kinase fulfils several functions in the infected cell (summarized in Fig. 2). An early and transient peak of activity is observed during viral attachment to cells. Later in the infection cycle the kinase is activated in a more persistent manner due to expression of the viral A/NS1 protein. With regard to the virus supportive function of PI3K, there is an early requirement of the kinase for efficient viral entry. Similar mechanisms have already been observed for Ebola virus infection (Saeed et al., 2008). At later stages, PI3K seems to suppress premature apoptosis, most likely mediated by binding to the A/NS1 protein. Finally, the kinase also exhibits antiviral functions by regulating the IRF\u20103 transcription factor during type I IFN induction.",

In this context it is crucial to elucidate the sorting mechanisms of A/NS1. Other analysis may comprise additional interaction partners of A/NS1, such as Crk/CrkL and their regulation. A major challenge is also to unravel the activation mechanism and function of PI3K during virus entry.
