The community 169 spread of the infection has infected several medical personnel, sometimes unknowingly and 170 sometimes in the line of duty even after donning the full PPE. To that effect, the 171 government regulations have been clouded in ambiguity. Several hospitals were asked to 172 close down completely after exposure to an infected patient. Then, there were instances of 173 FIR being filed against the doctors after they got infected during their outpatient clinic 174 work. Although the recent orders under the ESMA (essential services maintenance act) 175 indicated that all clinics and hospitals should remain open, the private hospitals were instructed not to ask for COVID testing for surgical patients. But the Orthopaedic 177 surgeons are still looking after trauma work and will extend their services to active COVID 178 care as needed. As doctors we have learned to always care for the sick, and as surgeons we 179 are conditioned to be in leadership positions, but the fact remains that anxiety, 180 apprehension and stress about the right course of professional action in light of the above 181 information, continues to increase. However, we do hope that maybe if we have support 182 groups, occasional conversations, a lot of these burdens and stress will be shared and hopefully 183 lessened. We may be asked to work on the frontlines in due course of time, and we agree with 184 Dyer et al that this would be a privilege to help the society (12) . These are the times when close 185 cooperation, collaborative efforts, teamwork and open communication lines will be needed 186 among the colleagues, with greater support to be extended to the younger members. Hopefully, 187 soon enough we will all come out of the lockdown and the pandemic and would have endured its 188 effect with resilience and vigor. 189 We recognize certain limitations in our study. The number of Orthopaedic surgeon surveyed 190 (611) may seem an inadequate representation of the total 12000 orthopaedic surgeons in India 191 (according to IOA membership) (17) , however all the recently published COVID surveys that 192 represented a much bigger population have had 600-650 responses (11,18) . Hence, not only, is this 193 an adequate number for representing the relative smaller community of Indian Orthopaedic 194 surgeons, but also, our strength of survey is bigger than any other published recent surveys of 195 Orthopaedic surgeons. Another limitation is that the non-response rate could not be 196 calculated, and it is possible that people who were experiencing psychological symptoms 197 were more likely to respond to the survey. The number of orthopaedic surgeons who are 198 stressed out may change as the lockdown extends further than 3 weeks and the pandemic spreads 199 wider. We only examined how stressed the orthopaedic surgeons were through online surveys 200",
