In the context of research mice, this means using animals that are genetically appropriate for the specific investigation and free of the variability induced by infections. From a genetic perspective research scientists address animal quality issues by testing their mice for consistency of genetic background, and in the case of genetically engineered mutant mice (GEM), for direct evidence that specific genes of interest are present (or absent in the case of knockouts). It is prudent to do this testing prior to embarking on an expensive research project (Fahey et al., 2013). Similarly, it is prudent to verify the health status of research mouse colonies to exclude mice compromised by infections. Even in the absence of clinical signs of disease, infections in mice are well known as a source of variability that can have adverse effects on research or may present a health hazard to laboratory staff (i.e., zoonotic infections of mice) and thus should be avoided when doing research.",

The species and prevalence of the agents (viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi) established in these surveys were dependent on the geographic areas and institutions under study. Nonetheless, these data point out that despite efforts taken at many research institutions worldwide to eliminate infectious agents and elevate the health status of their animal facilities, infectious agents of mice still persist. Moreover, novel infectious agents of mice are being discovered more frequently now as genome sequencing methods become faster and less expensive. Murine astrovirus (MuAstV) is such an example. The virus was first identified in 1985 by electron microscopy following an outbreak of diarrhea in a colony of nude mice and not further characterized until 2013 by use of viral metagenomics (Kjeldsberg and Hem, 1985; Ng et al., 2013). The availability of sophisticated molecular diagnostic techniques, the increased use of immunodeficient, transgenic, and humanized mice, and the increasing exchange of research animals and animal products among laboratories nationally and internationally guarantee that this trend of emerging/re\u2010emerging infectious agents will continue.",

A survey of animal health professionals at research institutions across the U.S. (Carty, 2008) reported that routine HM programs afford the optimal means of detecting disease outbreaks in animal facilities. The Federation of European Laboratory Science Associations (FELASA) regularly emphasizes this fact by meticulously outlining rodent HM guidelines for research animal facilities (M\u00e4hler et al., 2014). HM programs are generally based on long\u2010established standardized lists of target organisms (Tables 1 and 2) as well as recently discovered microorganisms. Yet, it is common for institutional laboratory animal veterinarians to tailor HM programs to meet their facilities\u2019 specific needs in a cost\u2010effective manner, since the prevalence of murine pathogens varies by institution. Understanding HM programs is essential to the well\u2010being of one's animals as well as the preservation of data integrity. For this reason, it is important, especially for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, new investigators and others with limited experience in dealing with infections in mouse colonies that they become familiar with the HM programs at their own institutional animal facilities. In addition to discussions with animal health professionals at your research institution, further resources on this subject are available at a number of laboratory animal associations (see Internet Resources below) and at professional mouse vendors to assist scientists in understanding the vagaries of health surveillance.",

Viral infections of mice are the greatest concern to laboratory animal veterinarians and animal facility personnel because of their potential for spread across a facility, the diseases they can cause and their impact on research. There are seventeen viral species in Table 1 many of which have substrains or additional serotypes that infect mice. However, the prevalence of these viruses varies greatly, with some no longer found in research animal facilities. Some viral infections, such as murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), mouse thymic virus (MTV), murine polyomavirus (MPyV), ectromelia virus (ECTA), reovirus (REO) have declined significantly since the 1990's and have become rare or nonexistent in mouse colonies. Based on serological or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data from the past fifteen years (Weisbroth, 1999; Prichett\u2010Corning et al., 2009; M\u00e4hler et al., 2014), the most prevalent viral agents in contemporary mouse facilities are mouse norovirus (MNV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), mouse parvovirus (MPV), and mouse rotavirus (MRV, known as epizootic diarrhea of infant mice, EDIM). Agents such as MNV and MPV are shed in mouse feces for as long as 2 months, even by immunocompetent mice. Additionally, small non\u2010enveloped viruses (i.e., MPV, MNV, MRV) are very resistant to chemical or environmental inactivation. In contrast, although MHV does not remain active for long periods in the environment, it is highly contagious and thus continues to be a major infectious agent in mouse facilities, especially in conventionally housed mice. It is likely that some agents may be prevalent simply because they are newly recognized (i.e, MNV, MuAstV; Kjeldsberg and Hem, 1985; Karst et al., 2003; Ng et al., 2013). A recently discovered murine virus, murine astrovirus (MuAstV; Ng et al., 2013) has not yet been the subject of widespread surveillance so the prevalence of this virus in research animal facilities is unknown at this time.",

Laboratory animal veterinarians often classify murine viruses into risk groups according to the significance of interference with research, infectivity and potential for spread and difficulties with detection and elimination. In Table 1, a simple classification scheme of A to D is based on these criteria. Viruses in groups A and B are more likely to adversely affect research and for group A, present the risk of human infection. Viruses in group C have minimal impact on research and are not common whereas those in group D are recently discovered viruses whose impact on research is not well known. For example, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and hantavirus are at risk level A because of their zoonotic potential, that is, their ability to infect humans as well as mice. A few other viral agents, including murine adenovirus\u20101 (MAdV\u20101), ECTA, MHV polytropic strains, and Sendai virus (SV), are also classified as risk level A because they are capable of causing clinical illness in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient adult mice. Viruses at risk level B may interfere with specific experiments involving the host immune system (parvovirus, MCMV, MTV, lactate dehydrogenase\u2010elevating virus [LDEV], MHV enterotropic strains), central nervous system (Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, TMEV), or gastrointestinal systems (MAdV\u20102, MRV).",

Regarding bacterial infections, the actual species of bacteria isolated from infected mice vary to a great extent depending on the genetics and phenotype, age, and immune status of the mice, as well as environmental factors such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), human traffic flow, husbandry practices (e.g., bedding type, caging system), preparation of animal supplies (sterile versus non\u2010sterile), and human contact with mice. For example, virtually all mouse strains are susceptible to infection with opportunistic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Proteus mirabilis and Helicobacter spp. and these species are commonly found in many mouse facilities (Prichett\u2010Corning et al., 2009; Treuting et al., 2012). Yet, taking certain precautions in mouse\u2010housing facilities can substantially reduce the prevalence of opportunistic bacterial infections. This topic will be discussed below under disease prevention. The preponderance of bacterial infections of mice is non\u2010lethal, subclinical infections. Asymptomatic mice may only be identified at the time of health monitoring when microbial cultures or PCR yield positive results. In a number of animals, however, infections with bacterial opportunists can present as clinical cases, such as bite\u2010wound and retrobulbar abscesses, conjunctivitis, otitis, rectal prolapse and other overt signs of infection (Treuting et al., 2012).",

The existence of parasitic infections in research mouse facilities may be the result of unidentified or untreated enzootic infections of existing mouse colonies; most mice infested with endo\u2010 and ecto\u2010parasites are asymptomatic and may harbor a low parasite burden that is difficult to detect via standard HM methods. Other factors that may contribute to the continued presence of parasites in some research colonies may include unregulated movement of mice between institutional animal facilities and a lack of proper quarantine procedures that allow for ample time for testing or treatment of imported mice. Additionally, pinworm infections may be particularly problematic due to treatment failure, persistence of eggs in the environment and diagnostic inefficiencies. Although parasitic infections do not typically cause clinical signs in either immunocompetent or immunodeficient mice, there is evidence that these infections do cause physiologic changes that may significantly impact research studies (Beattie et al., 1980; Bugarski et al., 2006; Michels et al., 2006).",

The benefits of serologic testing are that it is relatively inexpensive, yet provides information about current and previous infections that have occurred in a mouse colony because serum antibodies generally persist in mice for months after resolution of an infection. Additionally, current serologic test platforms such as the enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplexed fluorometric immunoassay (MFI, Luminex) enable the detection of multiple infectious agents from a single serum sample. Both assay platforms can also be used as high throughput systems and are the most cost\u2010effective diagnostic systems for large\u2010scale surveillance. Another serology test, the indirect immuno\u2010fluorescence antibody (IFA) assay is often used to confirm equivocal results of ELISA or MFI because of its sensitivity and specificity. However, performing IFAs is labor intensive and highly dependent on the technical expertise of the observer, so it is not used as frequently as ELISA or MFI.

Sample source and properties of bacteria being monitored determine types of medium (selective or differential) and incubation conditions (aerobic or anaerobic; Fox et al., 2006; Percy and Barthold, 2007). Microbiologic culture and identification of bacteria and fungi is labor, equipment and expertise intensive.",

Endoparasites such as Trichomonas can be identified in cecum and colon tissues minced in saline. The same is true for other protozoan parasites. Identification of pinworms and pinworm eggs can also be done microscopically. To enhance this process the eggs can be concentrated by pre\u2010treatment of gut content samples with zinc or sodium sulfate whose specific gravities enable the eggs to \u201cfloat\u201d on top of the medium after centrifugation. The eggs are then adhered to a glass cover slide, attached to a microscope slide and observed under a microscope. Ectoparasites such as fur mites are also identified by direct microscopic evaluation of mice or of plucked fur samples from their head and neck. In all cases, expertise in microscopic identification of parasites is required to reliably confirm the presence of parasites. Currently, the trend in parasite diagnostics is leaning towards the use of PCR as the preferred method of detection.",

For example, P. murina is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen that in immunocompetent mice produces a clinically silent infection controlled by a T\u2010cell mediated immune response. However in many immunodeficient mouse strains, Pneumocystis produces lethal pulmonary infections (Weisbroth, 2006). Since many GEM strains are \u201cimmunovague\u201d (Treuting et al., 2012), that is, have an unknown or variable capacity to mount an effective acquired immune response, these strains should be considered potentially susceptible to lethal Pneumocystis infections. Currently, the best method of identifying Pneumocystis in mice is via PCR on a sample of lung tissue from potentially affected animals. This requires that the mice be humanely euthanized and a piece of lung submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. Ideally, for routine health surveillance of immunodeficient mouse colonies, mice taken directly from immunodeficient stocks or immunodeficient sentinel mice should be tested regularly for the presence of Pneumocystis in a mouse room.",

Examples of biosecurity applied at the building level are high\u2010efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration of room air, room access controls for personnel so that only approved individuals can enter a mouse room, detailed procedures for movement of personnel and mice from room to room, use of construction materials that can withstand repeated chemical disinfection, and physical separation of areas where clean, sterilized caging materials are prepared and handled away from mouse waste and dirty cages. Generally speaking, research investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students are not involved in the oversight or use of biosecurity measures at this level.

IVC caging systems are considered very secure with regard to exposure of mice to adventitious infectious agents. Though IVC caging offers greater protection of mice to inadvertent exposure to infectious agents, for both cage types, IVC and conventional, the real risks are associated with handling of mice during cage changes, experimental use, and other handling that present opportunities for exposure of mice to infectious agents.

Direct human contact with mice is inadvisable as it increases the risk of transmission of human opportunistic bacteria to the mice by exposure to human skin, breath, nasal or oral secretions.

The specific combination of personal protective equipment (PPE) varies with the institution and is in most cases chosen by the animal facility and veterinary staff; however, in general, personnel that routinely work with mice should always wear gloves and a clean lab coat or scrubs. Mask, bonnet, and shoe covers or dedicated mouse room shoes should be worn in higher health status rooms. Immunodeficient and GEM mice housed in high level barrier rooms generally require more stringent PPE, such as sterilized PPE that may also include face shields or powered air\u2010purifying respirators (PAPRs) to further prevent inadvertent exposure of the mice to infectious agents.

Therefore, physical separation of mice based on health status and regulation of mouse movement and human traffic is another biosecurity measure that is employed at many institutions. For this reason, movement of mice between mouse rooms is inadvisable unless it is a controlled move sanctioned by the veterinary staff. Additionally, each mouse room may have its own environmental microflora as well as that present in the mice.
