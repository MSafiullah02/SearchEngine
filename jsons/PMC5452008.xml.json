            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are a major cause of liver\u2010related morbidity and mortality. An estimated 160 million persons are chronically infected worldwide and are at risk to develop liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Lavanchy, 2011). Because of their substantial impact on human health, HCV infections have been extensively studied. HCV is now one of the most widely used model systems to investigate host\u2013virus interactions (Colpitts et al, 2015). HCV is transmitted through blood and infects and replicates in hepatocytes. Due to the lack of a small animal model and of the difficulties inherent to working with human samples, HCV\u2013host cell interactions have been mainly studied in a cell culture system, specifically in Huh7\u2010derived hepatoma cells infected with the JFH1 isolate of the virus (Lindenbach et al, 2005; Wakita et al, 2005; Zhong et al, 2005; Walters et al, 2009; Colpitts et al, 2015). Experiments in this in vitro system have identified a large number of host factors that are required for viral replication or that have antiviral properties (Colpitts et al, 2015). This experimental system also brought important insights into the virus\u2013host interactions that may contribute to pathogenesis, for example, revealing cell cycle perturbations in HCV\u2010infected cells (Walters et al, 2009). However, few of these findings have been evaluated in the human liver.",

            "text": "Studying HCV infections in vivo presents important challenges. An intrinsic difficulty comes from the immune response, which is a strong confounding factor in analyses of human liver biopsies. Gene expression differences between HCV\u2010infected and uninfected livers are the result of direct HCV\u2010induced cell\u2010autonomous adaptive responses in infected cells and of more global changes that result from the immune response in the liver. The chronic phase of HCV infections is characterized by a largely ineffective cellular immune response combined with a highly variable interferon\u2010lambda\u2010mediated innate immune response (Heim & Thimme, 2014). A significant proportion of patients are characterized by an endogenous activation of the interferon (IFN) system, in which hundreds of classical IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs) are strongly induced (Heim & Thimme, 2014). The presence of the endogenous IFN system activation can mask more subtle changes that occur as a direct consequence of viral infection and replication in HCV\u2010infected cells. The confounding effect of the immune answer is aggravated by the fact that the percentage of HCV\u2010infected hepatocytes rarely exceeds 50% and often is below 20%, whereas ISG expression can be observed in up to 95% of cells (Wieland et al, 2014). To better understand the molecular consequences of HCV infection in vivo, it is thus important to disentangle the direct cellular response to viral infections from the transcriptional signature of the immune response, and in particular of the endogenous IFN system activation.",

            "text": "The endogenous activity of the IFN system is also highly relevant for therapeutic choice in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Until the recent introduction of direct antiviral drugs for the treatment of CHC, recombinant pegylated IFN\u2010alpha 2 (pegIFN\u2010\u03b1) had been an essential component of the standard of care for CHC for over 25 years, and it is still used in many parts of the world. Treatment with pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 and ribavirin achieved cure rates between 30 and 80%, depending on the viral genotype, pre\u2010treatment patient history, and stage of liver fibrosis (Heim, 2013). The success of the treatment is also highly dependent on the genetic background of the patients. Genome\u2010wide association studies revealed significant associations between polymorphisms in the IFNL4 gene and response to pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin (Bibert et al, 2013; Prokunina\u2010Olsson et al, 2013; Terczynska\u2010Dyla et al, 2014). The recently discovered IFNL4 protein has strong antiviral properties and stimulates ISG production through binding to the IFN\u2010lambda receptor (Hamming et al, 2013; Prokunina\u2010Olsson et al, 2013). The IFNL4 gene harbors several genetic variants in human populations, including a frameshift mutation that abrogates the production of the IFNL4 protein (Terczynska\u2010Dyla et al, 2014). Paradoxically, the IFNL4\u2010producing genotype is associated with poor response to pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin, whereas mutated alleles coding for an IFNL4 variant with strongly reduced biological activity or even a complete loss of function are associated with very good spontaneous and treatment\u2010induced resolution rates (Terczynska\u2010Dyla et al, 2014). These observations are consistent with earlier findings that patients who have a strong endogenous induction of ISGs during the chronic phase of HCV infection do not respond to therapeutically injected pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 (Chen et al, 2005; Asselah et al, 2008; Sarasin\u2010Filipowicz et al, 2008). It is presently not known why the activation of the endogenous IFN system in the liver in patients with the IFNL4\u2010producing genotype is ineffective against HCV, whereas pegIFN\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced ISG expression results in viral eradication in so many patients.",

With this objective, we generated and analyzed high\u2010throughput transcriptome sequencing profiles from liver biopsies derived from different categories of HCV\u2010infected and non\u2010infected patients, prior to and during treatment. First, to unveil HCV\u2010induced cell\u2010autonomous effects and to separate them from IFN\u2010induced changes in the transcriptome, we selected liver biopsies from CHC patients without hepatic ISG induction, and compared them with uninfected control biopsies. Second, we examined the transcriptomic changes associated with the endogenous activation of the IFN system in a subset of CHC patients. Finally, we analyzed the gene expression changes resulting from pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin treatment, by comparing transcriptome data from liver biopsies obtained before treatment and at different time points during the first week of therapy. We found that the transcriptional profiles associated with endogenous IFN activation and with pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin treatment share a core set of IFN\u2010stimulated genes, although quantitative differences can be found in gene activation levels.",

In particular, we evaluated the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of the hepatocellular and immunological host response to HCV infection. Interestingly, we found that the primary transcripts of several miRNAs [including miR\u2010122, which is required for HCV replication (Jopling et al, 2005)] are down\u2010regulated following pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment in the human liver. Consistently, we observe a subtle up\u2010regulation of the corresponding miRNA target genes, indicating that the expression changes observed for the precursor transcripts are reflected in the mature miRNA levels. Although these findings warrant further validation, we propose that the down\u2010regulation of miRNA primary transcripts, in particular for miR\u2010122, may contribute to efficiency of HCV clearance by pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin treatment.",

This distinction between two categories of CHC patients is highly relevant when seeking to determine the molecular consequences of HCV infection in the human liver, which otherwise can be confounded by the endogenous activation of the IFN system. We thus analyzed the expression levels of ISGs in the examined CHC patients. To do this, we mined a previously published dataset of ISGs (Dill et al, 2014) and extracted a set of genes that are strongly up\u2010regulated in the human liver upon pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment, requiring a minimum expression fold change of 2 across all studied time points. We thus obtained a set of 20 strong ISGs and we assessed their expression levels in 28 liver biopsies (including control non\u2010infected samples, termed hereafter non\u2010CHC) in our dataset (Fig 1A, Dataset EV1).",

The first group, characterized by overall low\u2010ISG transcript levels, comprised 21 samples, including all six non\u2010CHC liver biopsies and 15 of the CHC samples. Importantly, no clear distinction was found between the non\u2010CHC and the CHC samples in this group. The second group, consisting of seven CHC samples, displayed higher expression levels across the 20 analyzed ISGs (Fig 1A). Importantly, we note that this separation between two groups of patients cannot be explained by the HCV genotype carried by the CHC patients, as all four genotypes were found in the seven patients with high\u2010ISG levels (Fig 1A). Similarly, analysis of the inflammation and fibrosis METAVIR scores (Bedossa & Poynard, 1996) and of the HCV viral load indicated that these factors cannot explain the patient grouping (Fig 1A and B). To verify that the clustering of CHC samples was not dependent on the set of genes used as markers, we performed a principal component analysis on 360 genes associated with Gene Ontology (GO) categories related to response to interferon (Materials and Methods). This analysis confirmed that our sample sub\u2010classification is robust with respect to the choice of the ISG input dataset (Appendix Fig S1).",

Experiments in Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells recently showed that HCV functionally sequesters miR\u2010122, thus reducing its binding to endogenous target genes and leading to their up\u2010regulation (Luna et al, 2015). To assess whether this observation also holds in vivo, we analyzed the expression fold change of predicted miRNA targets in CHC low\u2010ISG samples compared to non\u2010CHC samples (Fig 2D). We analyzed a set of microRNAs expressed in normal and/or HCV\u2010infected human livers (Hou et al, 2011) and a set of evolutionarily conserved miRNA targets predicted computationally with TargetScan (Agarwal et al, 2015; Dataset EV4; Materials and Methods). We found that miR\u2010122 targets had significantly higher fold changes (median 0.045) than targets of other expressed miRNAs (median \u22120.025, Wilcoxon rank sum test, P\u2010value 1e\u20103) and than genes not targeted by this set of liver miRNAs (median \u22120.15, Wilcoxon rank sum test, P\u2010value < 1e\u201010; Fig 2D). These observations are compatible with the reported subtle de\u2010repression of miR\u2010122 target genes in the presence of HCV infection (Luna et al, 2015). However, we also found that miR\u2010122 targets have comparable expression fold changes with the targets of other highly expressed miRNAs, such as miR\u2010192, let\u20107, or miR\u2010199 (Fig 2D). Similar conclusions were reached when analyzing a set of miRNA targets identified in Huh7 cells using high\u2010throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (Luna et al, 2015; Appendix Fig S2B, Dataset EV4). Overall, the fold expression change was positively correlated with the number of distinct miRNA families that are predicted to target each gene (Appendix Fig S2C). This observation cannot be simply explained by the previously reported sequestration of miR\u2010122 by HCV, but may reflect the expression or functional characteristics of genes targeted by multiple miRNA families. Our results thus reveal a potential confounding factor in the up\u2010regulation of miR\u2010122 targets following HCV infection.",

We found numerous genes with significant expression changes, including 176 protein\u2010coding genes and 21 lncRNA candidates (Appendix Fig S4).

Although our unsupervised gene ontology analyses did not reveal enrichments for cell cycle\u2010associated categories among the genes differentially expressed in CHC samples (Dataset EV3), we found significant intersections between the sets of genes that are differentially expressed following HCV infection in vivo and in vitro. Specifically, out of 698 protein\u2010coding genes differentially regulated in HCV\u2010infected Huh\u20107.5 cells (Materials and Methods), we found that 25 (3.6%) were differentially expressed between control and CHC low\u2010ISG samples and 48 (6.9%) were differentially expressed between control and CHC high\u2010ISG samples (FDR < 0.1, Dataset EV5). The extent of the overlap was significantly higher than expected by chance given the total number of differentially expressed genes, in both cases (chi\u2010square test, P\u2010value < 1e\u20109). The common differentially regulated genes included several genes associated with cell death and cell cycle, such as UBD, TNFRSF9, BIRC3, JUN, and FOS (Dataset EV5). Differentially expressed genes shared between HCV\u2010infected Huh\u20107.5 cells and high\u2010ISG liver biopsies include classical ISGs, such as MX1, ISG15, and IFIT1 (Dataset EV5), as expected given the previously reported induction of interferon\u2010stimulated genes in these cells (Walters et al, 2009).",

As previously reported (Dill et al, 2014), most differentially expressed protein\u2010coding genes were observed at 16 h post\u2010treatment, followed by the 4\u2010h time point (Fig 5A).

Interestingly, three lncRNAs were found to be significantly up\u2010regulated at all time points (Dataset EV8, Appendix Fig S5F\u2013H).

To investigate the molecular differences between these two modes of IFN system activation, we compared the transcriptional response to pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment with the one elicited by the endogenous IFN system activation. We first extracted the genes that are significantly up\u2010 or down\u2010regulated following pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment, at each time point, and analyzed their expression differences between CHC low\u2010ISG and CHC high\u2010ISG patients (Fig 6, Dataset EV9). We found that the vast majority of genes that are up\u2010regulated upon pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment are also induced in high\u2010ISG patients (Fig 6, Dataset EV9). In numerous cases, these differences were also statistically significant (FDR < 10%) in the comparison between low\u2010ISG and high\u2010ISG patients (Fig 6). However, the level of gene induction was significantly stronger in the pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment analysis (Fig 6A), as were the absolute levels of gene expression in the corresponding samples (Fig 6C). In other words, the ISG expression levels reached after pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin treatment are higher than the ones observed in patients with high endogenous ISG levels. In contrast, genes that were down\u2010regulated upon pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment were only rarely down\u2010regulated in high ISG compared to low\u2010ISG patients (Fig 6B and D). Similar conclusions were reached when extracting genes that are significantly differentially expressed between low\u2010ISG and high\u2010ISG patients and analyzing their expression patterns following pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment (Appendix Fig S6). We analyzed the global similarity in expression patterns between high\u2010ISG samples and post\u2010treatment samples, using a principal component analysis and a hierarchical clustering analysis applied to pegIFN\u2010\u03b1\u2010affected genes (Appendix Fig S7). Both clustering methods indicated that high\u2010ISG samples are globally similar in expression patterns to the later time points in the pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment (48, 96 and 144 h). Taken together, these observations suggest that the endogenous IFN system activation and its external stimulation with pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin treatment have qualitatively similar effects on the gene expression patterns on the human liver transcriptomes. However, numerous quantitative differences in the two transcriptional responses can be observed, with stronger ISG induction levels following pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin treatment.",

However, a number of these candidate ISGs were indeed significantly more stimulated by pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 than by endogenous IFNs in high\u2010ISG patients (Fig 7A, Dataset EV10). In particular, six genes (IRF1, IRF2, IRF7, IRF9, OASL, IFITM3) that were reported as antiviral effectors in at least two publications (Schoggins et al, 2011; Metz et al, 2013) did not differ significantly between low\u2010ISG and high\u2010ISG samples. However, with the exception of IRF2, all of them appeared to be induced in high\u2010ISG patients compared to controls or low\u2010ISG patients, albeit at weak levels. Thus, we could not identify ISGs that are exclusively induced by pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 and that could be bona fide anti\u2010HCV effector genes.",

We thus assessed the expression levels of mature miRNAs using qPCR, for three miRNAs whose primary transcripts were down\u2010regulated upon pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment: miR\u2010122\u20105p, miR\u2010146a\u20105p, and miR\u2010331\u20103p (Materials and Methods). For all three miRNAs, this data indicates that the mature miRNAs are indeed down\u2010regulated after pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment at the 16\u2010h time point (also at the 96\u2010h time point for miR\u2010122\u20105p and miR\u2010146a\u20105p; Appendix Fig S10, Dataset EV12). To further test this hypothesis (albeit indirectly), we reasoned that a decrease in mature miRNA expression levels should positively affect the expression of their target genes. We thus analyzed the behavior of predicted miRNA target genes in response to pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin treatment, at the 16\u2010h time point (for which most miRNA host down\u2010regulation events were observed; Fig 8A). As above, we analyzed microRNAs expressed in normal and/or HCV\u2010infected human livers (Hou et al, 2011) and their conserved targets predicted computationally with TargetScan (Agarwal et al, 2015; Materials and Methods). Strikingly, out of 79 miRNA families with at least 100 conserved target genes, the three highest median expression fold changes at the 16\u2010h time point were found for miRNAs whose precursor genes were down\u2010regulated following treatment: miR\u2010122, miR\u2010331, and miR\u2010146a/b (Fig 8C). High median fold changes were also observed for miR\u201022, as well as for miR\u201024, miR\u2010214, and miR\u2010192 to a lower extent (Fig 8C). We note that this pattern is specific to the 16\u2010h time point; that is, the miRNAs whose primary transcripts are down\u2010regulated do not stand out from the bulk of liver\u2010expressed miRNAs at other time points (Appendix Figs S11 and S12). This result is consistent with our analysis of the temporal dynamics of interferon\u2010induced gene expression, as the strongest changes following pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment were also observed at the 16\u2010h time point, for most gene categories (Fig 5).",

Adaptive changes were described in lipid biosynthetic pathways, endoplasmatic reticulum stress response, autophagy, and cell cycle regulation. However, due to the difficulties inherent to human liver tissue sampling, few of these findings have been validated in vivo. To investigate whether the observations obtained in cell culture systems can be confirmed in the human liver, we have collected and analyzed transcriptome data from liver biopsies derived from control and chronic hepatitis C patients, in the absence of and during treatment with pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin.",

In experimentally infected chimpanzees, transcriptome analysis revealed a strong induction of hundreds of ISGs in all animals (Bigger et al, 2004). Due to a genetic polymorphism in the IFNL4 gene, ISG induction in humans is variable (Prokunina\u2010Olsson et al, 2013; Terczynska\u2010Dyla et al, 2014). In this study, in order to reduce the strong confounding influence of the endogenous IFN system, we analyzed gene expression patterns separately for patients with or without endogenous IFN activation. We found that gene expression changes between uninfected liver samples and low\u2010ISG samples mainly reflect the presence of immune cell infiltrates in the latter group. However, even in biopsies from patients without ISG induction (low\u2010ISG patients) we could not detect expression changes of genes involved in cellular responses to HCV described in cell culture. For example, a previous large\u2010scale analysis of differential gene expression in HCV\u2010infected Huh\u20107.5 cells revealed that numerous genes involved in cell death, cell cycle, and cell growth/proliferation are mis\u2010regulated following viral infection (Walters et al, 2009), while our differential expression analyses did not reveal enrichments for these functional categories of genes. We therefore used a targeted approach and specifically analyzed genes previously reported to be changed in HCV\u2010infected Huh\u20107.5 cells (Walters et al, 2009). Specifically, we could identify a core set of 25 genes that are differentially expressed following HCV infection both in Huh\u20107.5 cells and in liver samples from patients without IFN system activation. This common gene set included several cell cycle\u2010associated genes, such as UBD, ITIH1, and BIRC3 (Dataset EV5; Walters et al, 2009). Thus, we were able to identify a significant number of genes that respond to HCV infection both in vivo and in vitro.",

It is thus conceivable that some of changes described in cell culture are due to the high viral concentration and do not occur in vivo. However, it is also possible that our analysis was underpowered to detect HCV\u2010induced cell\u2010intrinsic changes in gene expression. Changes in infected hepatocytes could be masked by unchanged gene expression in non\u2010infected hepatocytes and non\u2010parenchymal liver cells (endothelial cells, biliary epithelial cells, stellate cells, fibroblasts, and Kupffer cells). Non\u2010parenchymal cells provide about one\u2010third of the liver mass, and the number of infected hepatocytes can vary from 1 to 55% (Wieland et al, 2014). To minimize the information dilution from uninfected cells, we preferentially included in our study samples from patients with high viral load, because the proportion of infected cells significantly correlates with serum viral load (Wieland et al, 2014). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that because of these limitations we could not detect some genuine HCV\u2010induced cell\u2010intrinsic changes of gene expression.",

            "text": "We also addressed a long\u2010standing conundrum in the field regarding the inability of the endogenous IFN system activation to eradicate HCV infections. Ever since the discovery that a substantial proportion of patients with CHC have a strong induction of hundreds of ISGs in the liver (Chen et al, 2005; Asselah et al, 2008; Sarasin\u2010Filipowicz et al, 2008) it remained unclear why the endogenous IFN system is ineffective against HCV, whereas therapies with recombinant (pegylated) IFN\u2010\u03b1 were curative in many patients. Two alternative explanations were discussed: Either some critical ISGs are exclusively induced by pegIFN\u2010\u03b1, or pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 induces the same ISGs but at a higher level than the endogenous IFNs. At first sight, our results indicate that the number of significantly changed ISGs is much higher after pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 compared to those induced by endogenous IFNs (in high\u2010ISG samples), suggesting that pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 indeed induces additional ISGs that are not stimulated by endogenous IFNS. However, most of these \u201cadditional\u201d genes were up\u2010regulated in high\u2010ISG samples as well, albeit to a lesser degree and therefore not passing the significance threshold. Such quantitative differences were also observed for a number of candidate anti\u2010HCV effector ISGs identified in large screens (Schoggins et al, 2011; Metz et al, 2013). Most of them were significantly stronger induced by pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 compared to endogenous IFNs, but their expression levels were highly positively correlated between samples treated with pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin and samples with high endogenous ISG levels (Fig 7, Dataset EV10). We present six candidate antiviral effectors [IRF1, IRF2, IRF7, IRF9, OASL, IFITM3, reported in both publications cited above (Schoggins et al, 2011; Metz et al, 2013)] that do not differ significantly between low\u2010ISG and high\u2010ISG patients. However, with the exception of IRF2, these genes also appear to be slightly induced in high\u2010ISG samples compared to low\u2010ISG or non\u2010infected samples, although at lower levels (Fig 7). Of note, IRF2 stands out because it is induced by pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 at the 4\u2010h time point, but appears to down\u2010regulated by endogenous IFNs (Fig 7). However, IRF2 is unlikely to be an antiviral effector sensu stricto. IRF2 is a transcriptional regulator involved in IFN induction and in IFN signaling (Ikushima et al, 2013). Our in vivo analysis therefore could not reliably identify a set of ISG effectors uniquely up\u2010regulated by pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 that could be responsible for the superior antiviral efficacy of the treatment. Thus, our current analysis for the first time provides strong evidence that quantitative rather than qualitative differences in gene induction are responsible for the failure of the endogenous IFNs and the success of pegIFN\u2010\u03b1 in viral eradication.",

The fascinating role of the highly abundant miR\u2010122 in HCV replication and virus\u2013host interaction has recently been enriched by the observation that binding of miR\u2010122 by HCV can regulate host gene expression by reducing (sponging) the amount of miR\u2010122 available for gene repression (Luna et al, 2015). Detailed functional experiments in Huh7 cells brought evidence that HCV infection leads to significant de\u2010repression of miR\u2010122 target genes due to this sponging effect (Luna et al, 2015). At first sight, our in vivo transcriptomic analysis appeared to confirm this observation, as miR\u2010122 target genes had higher expression levels in HCV\u2010infected compared to control biopsies, more so than genes targeted by all other miRNAs and than genes that are not targets of miRNAs (Figs 2 and 3). However, a closer look revealed the same pattern for other miRNAs highly expressed in the liver (e.g. miR\u2010192, let\u20107). Because HCV does not bind these other miRNAs, this observation cannot be simply explained by a sponging effect.",

Nevertheless, this observation indicates that the expression changes observed for the primary transcripts are reflected in the mature miRNA levels, as also indicated by our qPCR analysis for three candidate miRNAs. This finding is in agreement with previous evidence that IFN\u2010beta treatment decreases mature miR\u2010122 levels (Pedersen et al, 2007) and that miR\u2010122 levels are lower in patients with endogenous IFN system activation (Sarasin\u2010Filipowicz et al, 2009). Interestingly, besides miR\u2010122, several other miRNAs whose host genes are down\u2010regulated have been associated with HCV infections and/or interferon treatment. For example, miR\u2010146a was previously reported to inhibit type I interferon production (Hou et al, 2009; Ho et al, 2014). Its down\u2010regulation following pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/treatment might thus allow for a sustained activation of ISGs and thus more effective antiviral response. Another example is miR\u2010192, which was previously proposed as a predictor for the response to IFN treatment (Motawi et al, 2015). Finally, it is tempting to speculate that the down\u2010regulation of miR\u2010122 levels might contribute to the efficiency of the pegIFN\u2010\u03b1/ribavirin treatment in eliminating HCV infections.",

The patients agreed to participate in the study and written informed consent was obtained (approved by the ethics commission of the cantons Basel\u2010Stadt and Basel\u2010Land; approval number EKBBM189/99). All patients with CHC were screened for potential response to treatment using a previously published classification method based on the expression values of IFI27, RSAD2, ISG15, and HTATIP2 (Dill et al, 2011). Patients with high probability of achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) were identified, and in case of planned IFN\u2010based treatment, they were asked to undergo a second liver biopsy. Both biopsies were performed in the morning. Nineteen patients agreed to undergo a second biopsy, as follows: after 4 h (five patients), 16 h (three patients), 48 h (three patients), 96 h (three patients), or 144 h (five patients) of the first therapeutic injection of pegylated interferons (pegIFNs). PegIFNs/Ribavirin doses were set according to HCV genotype and body weight based on standard recommendations. PegIFNs were administered subcutaneously once weekly at the initial dose of 1.5 \u03bcg/kg body weight of pegIFN\u2010\u03b1\u20102b (Essex Chemie) or 180 \u03bcg of pegIFN\u2010\u03b1\u20102a (Roche). Serum HCV RNA was quantified using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test and the COBAS Amplicor Monitor from Roche. Diagnosis of control patients was based on clinical, laboratory, and histopathological assessment.

For the CSF approach, to determine the codon substitution frequencies expected for coding and non\u2010coding regions, we aligned Ensembl\u2010annotated protein\u2010coding sequences and intronic regions, for 9,000 1\u20101 orthologous gene families for 42 vertebrate species extracted from the Ensembl Compara database (Vilella et al, 2009).

We then extracted all genomic regions with positive CSF scores. As positive CSF scores can appear spuriously on the opposite strand of protein\u2010coding regions (Cabili et al, 2011), for regions with positive CSF scores on both strands we considered only the strand with the highest score. Gene models were classified as potentially protein\u2010coding if had positive CSF scores over at least 90 bp or 25% of their exonic length. In addition, we searched for sequence similarity between exonic sequences and known proteins from and protein domains from the SwissProt (UniProt, 2015) and Pfam\u2010A (Finn et al, 2014) databases, using blastx (Altschul et al, 1990).

Equal amount of input total RNA was used in each reaction. RNA was diluted to 4 ng/\u03bcl in water and cDNA was generated from 8 ng of total RNA using TaqMan\u2122 Advanced miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Applied Biosystems\u2122 cat# A28007) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, mature miRNAs were first extended on both ends via 3\u2032 polyA tailing and 5\u2032 RNA\u2010adaptor ligation. Next, a reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed using universal RT primers (supplied with the kit) that recognize the universal sequences present on both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 extended ends of the mature miRNAs. One\u2010sixth of RT reaction product was then used to pre\u2010amplify the cDNA using the universal primers (supplied with the kit) that recognize the universal sequences added to all mature miRNAs on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Expression of mature miRNAs miR\u2010122, miR\u2010146a, and miR\u2010331 was then analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using TaqMan\u00ae Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems\u2122, cat# 4444556) and corresponding TaqMan\u00ae Advanced miRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems\u2122, cat# A25576): hsa\u2010miR\u2010122\u20105p (assay ID: 477855_mir), hsa\u2010miR\u2010146a\u20105p (assay ID: 478399_mir), and hsa\u2010miR\u2010331\u20103p (assay ID: 478323_mir). For qPCR, pre\u2010amplified cDNA was diluted 1:10 with water and 5 \u03bcl of the diluted product (corresponding to 800 pg of input RNA) was used per reaction. An RT reaction without any template, RT reactions without the reverse transcriptase enzyme and qPCRs without any template served as negative controls. All qPCRs were performed in triplicate.",
