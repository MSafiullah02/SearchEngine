They have long been recognized as important pathogens of livestock and companion animals, and coronaviruses are a common cause of respiratory tract infections in man [1], [2]. In 2003, a coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of a new human disease, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3], [4], [5]. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spread within few months to more than 30 countries and caused the first epidemic of the new millennium. This event not only highlighted the potential of coronaviruses to seriously affect human health, but also gave a strong impetus on coronavirus research. Since then, bats were identified as a possible reservoir species of SARS-CoV [6], and a wealth of knowledge about coronavirus replication and pathogenesis has been gained [7], [8], [9].",

            "text": "The family Coronaviridae comprise two genera, Coronaviruses and Toroviruses, and is grouped together with two other families, the Arteriviridae and the Roniviridae, into the order Nidovirales [1], [10]. Although Nidoviruses differ in their genome sizes, structural proteins and morphology, they share a common genome organization and common mechanisms of RNA replication [1], [8], [9], [10], [11]. The name Nidovirus (from the Latin \u201cnido\u201d - nest) refers to the ability to transcribe a so-called \u201cnested set\u201d of subgenomic mRNAs [12]. Coronaviruses have genomes of approximately 30,000 nt, a length that is unprecedented amongst RNA viruses. The extreme genome size requires complex and only incompletely understood mechanisms of RNA replication, transcription, modification, and recombination, which are conducted by a multi-enzyme complex encoded by the replicase gene and the nucleocapsid gene [13], [14], [15]. It is speculated that coronaviruses have evolved this complex replication machinery to stably maintain their large genomic RNA and to encode additional functions that impact on virus\u2013host interactions [10]. Furthermore, the unique transcription strategy involves a discontinuous step during negative strand RNA synthesis that mechanistically reflects similarity-assisted RNA recombination. Thus, coronaviruses are well equipped for high frequency RNA recombination which facilitates rapid adaptation to new hosts.",

Later, this grouping has been confirmed by phylogenetic analyses based on genome sequencing data [8], [10], [16]. Soon after SARS-CoV has been recognized as a coronavirus, phylogenetic analyses revealed a relationship to group 2 coronaviruses, for which the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is the prototype. However, SARS-CoV also has unique features, suggesting that SARS-CoV represents an early split-off from the coronavirus group 2 lineage [8], [16].",

MHV, a natural mouse pathogen, has been extensively studied in the context of host immune responses and pathogenesis [2], [17], [18]. There are many different and well-characterized strains of MHV which, depending on organ tropism, virulence and host strain, can cause a wide array of diseases ranging from hepatitis, respiratory symptoms and gastroenteritis to CNS infection, demyelination, and acute meningitis [2], [17], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. Therefore, by using appropriate combinations of virus and mouse strains, MHV infections provide suitable models for a number of diseases that are of medical importance, such as encephalitis, immune-mediated demyelination (e.g. multiple sclerosis), hepatitis and acute respiratory infections (e.g. SARS).",

            "text": "IFN induction in fibroblasts occurs mainly by an intracellular pathway (Fig. 1A). Hallmark molecules of RNA viruses such as double-stranded (ds) RNA and 5\u2032-triphosphorylated single-stranded (ss) RNA trigger a signaling chain which activates IFN-\u03b2 gene expression [40], [41], [42], [43]. Two RNA helicases, RIG-I and MDA-5, are the main intracellular receptors of viral RNA [44], [45], [46], [47]. RIG-I and MDA-5 recognize different and non-overlapping sets of viruses, suggesting a degree of specificity in RNA recognition [45]. Indeed, it was recently found that RIG-I has the unique ability to bind the triphosphate groups on the 5\u2032-end of uncapped viral ssRNA [40], [41], [42]. MDA-5, by contrast, is apparently more dependent on dsRNA structures since it is required for the IFN response against picornaviruses which have genomic RNAs with a protein-protected 5\u2032-end [45], [48] and produce high levels of dsRNA [43]. The binding of a viral RNA to RIG-I and MDA-5 induces a signaling chain which eventually results in the phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF-3 [49], [50]. IRF-3 is a member of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family [51], [52] and plays a central role in the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter [53]. Phosphorylated IRF-3 homo-dimerizes and moves into the nucleus where it recruits the transcriptional coactivators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) to initiate IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis. This first-wave IFN triggers expression of a related factor, IRF-7, which in fibroblasts is only present in low amounts [54]. IRF-7 can be activated the same way as IRF-3 [55], [56], leading to a positive-feedback loop that initiates the synthesis of several IFN-\u03b1 subtypes as the second-wave IFNs [37], [54]. In addition, the transcription factors NF-\u03baB (activated by RIG-I, MDA-5 and the dsRNA-dependent kinase PKR) and AP-1 (activated by stress-induced Jun kinase) are triggered by viral replication [57], [58] to enhance IFN-\u03b2 gene expression.",

Activated TLRs signal through different intracellular adaptor molecules to induce IRF- and NF-\u03baB-dependent IFN transcription [61] (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, in contrast to other cell types, pDCs contain considerable amounts of constitutively expressed IRF-7 [62], [63]. IRF-7 is further upregulated in response to IFN and generates a positive-feedback loop for high IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 production [64], [65].

Binding of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 leads to conformational changes in the intracellular parts of the receptor which activate the so-called JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors which become phosphorylated by the Janus kinase (JAK) family members JAK-1 and TYK-2 [68], [69]. Phosphorylated STAT-1 and STAT-2 recruit a third factor, IRF-9 (also called p48), to form a complex known as IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF-3). The ISGF-3 heterotrimer translocates to the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoter regions of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby inducing their transcription.",

IFN-induced proteins include enzymes, transcription factors, cell surface glycoproteins, cytokines, chemokines and a large number of factors with unknown function. Up to now, only a few proteins with antiviral activity have been characterized in detail. These are the Mx GTPases, the protein kinase R (PKR), the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetases (2-5 OAS)/RNaseL system, the RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR 1), and the products of the ISG56 (p56) and ISG20 genes. Mx proteins belong to the superfamily of dynamin-like large GTPases and have been discovered as mediators of genetic resistance against orthomyxoviruses in mice. The human MxA protein blocks replication of the infecting virus soon after cell entry by targeting and missorting viral ribonucleoprotein particles [71], [72], [73], [74]. PKR, 2-5 OAS and ADAR are constitutively expressed in a latent, inactive form. Basal mRNA levels are upregulated by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and these enzymes need to be activated by viral dsRNA. PKR is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 [75], [76], thus blocking translation of cellular and viral mRNAs. The 2-5 OAS catalyses the synthesis of short 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates [77] that activate the latent endoribonuclease RNaseL which in turn degrades both viral and cellular RNAs [78]. ADAR 1 catalyzes the deamination of adenosine on target dsRNAs to yield inosine. As a result the secondary structure is destabilized due to a change from an AU base pair to the less stable IU base pair and mutations accumulate within the viral genome [28]. P56 binds the eukaryotic initiation factor 3e (eIF3e) subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3. It functions as an inhibitor of translation initiation at the level of eIF3 ternary complex formation and is likely to suppress viral RNA translation [79], [80]. ISG20 is an IFN-induced 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease that specifically degrades ssRNA in vitro. In cell culture, expression of ISG20 leads to a reduction of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza virus and retrovirus replication [81], [82], [83].",

Moreover, SARS-CoV [43] as well as MHV [100] were shown to generate substantial amounts of the IFN inducer dsRNA during infection. This implies that coronaviruses somehow avoid or inhibit the production of IFN in a manner similar to other viruses [27], [29], [101]. Indeed, in fibroblasts productively infected with SARS-CoV or MHV no detectable induction of IFN-\u03b2 occurs [102], [103], [104]. Human macrophages, which become only non-productively infected with SARS-CoV, are also unable to launch an IFN response [105], [106]. In fibroblasts, a lack of transcriptional induction was also observed for IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03bb, RANTES and IL-6 [107], suggesting that SARS-CoV-infected tissue cells are severely impaired in the production of a wide range of cytokines. In line with this, we have recently shown that in cells infected with SARS-CoV, no phosphorylation, dimerisation or CBP-binding of IRF-3 occur [102].",

            "text": "One possible mechanism that may at least in part account for the absence of IRF-3 activation and type I IFN expression is impaired sensing of coronaviruses by host cell-encoded pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as TLRs and the intracellular RNA sensors. Cytoplasmic viral RNAs could be recognized by RIG-I, MDA-5, or PKR (Fig. 2\n). As RIG-I is triggered by 5\u2032-triphosphates on ssRNA, it might not recognize the 5\u2032-capped genomic and subgenomic mRNAs. However, like all positive stranded RNA viruses, coronaviruses replicate their genome via negative-stranded RNA intermediates containing (most likely) 5\u2032-triphosphate ends. Moreover, the dsRNAs which are detectably formed during virus replication [43], [100] should be recognized intracellularly by MDA-5 and PKR and extracellularly by TLR-3. Coronaviruses may escape cellular RNA sensing by creating a microenvironment that is not accessible to cytoplasmic PRRs. Indeed, it has been shown that infection induces formation of double membrane vesicles (DMV) at perinuclear sites within the cytoplasm where RNA synthesis takes place [108], [109], [110], [111] (Fig. 2). It is tempting to speculate that dsRNA replication intermediates containing 5\u2032-triphosphorylated negative strands are located within DMVs and therefore protected from PRR sensing. In line with this, unimpeded IFN-\u03b2 mRNA production is observed in co-infections with Sendai Virus (SeV) and MHV or SARS-CoV [100], [112]. Similar findings were reported for MHV-infected cells treated with the IFN inducer poly I:C [104]. Apparently, the sensing of SeV RNA or poly I:C results in the transcription of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, and coronaviruses are unable to interrupt this process. Noteworthy, despite significant IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription, only markedly reduced levels of IFN-\u03b2 protein are secreted from in SeV/MHV-infected cells [112]. This indicates that MHV (and possibly other coronaviruses) counteract IFN-\u03b2 mRNA nuclear export and/or translation or affect downstream events such as IFN-\u03b2 protein stability and secretion.",

The mechanism of IFN signaling suppression by the SARS-CoV ORF6 gene product has been characterized in detail and it was shown that it tethers karyopherin alpha 2 and karyopherin beta 1 to the ER/Golgi membrane to disrupt nuclear import of STAT1 [114]. Additionally, the ORF7a protein has been shown to inhibit cellular protein synthesis [115], and the nsp 1 gene product has been suggested to promote host cell mRNA degradation [116]. The role of nsp1 in counteracting host innate immune responses was further studied in the MHV system [117]. A mutant virus containing a deletion in nsp1 was shown to replicate like wild-type virus in vitro but was strongly attenuated in mice, demonstrating that nsp1 is a major pathogenicity factor. In type I IFN receptor-deficient mice, however, replication of the nsp1 mutant virus was restored almost to the level of wild-type virus. Detailed phenotypic analysis revealed that nsp1 mutant replication was particularly reduced in IFN-\u03b1-treated macrophages, indicating that nsp1 mainly affects IFN signaling or downstream events of the type I IFN response.",

Active mechanisms include functions provided by the ORF3b, ORF6, N, nsp1 and ORF7a gene products.

Whereas mDCs infected with SARS-CoV or MHV have no detectable IFN synthesis (similar to fibroblasts), pDCs secrete substantial amounts of IFN in response to these coronaviruses [92]. For MHV it was further shown that this response was dependent on the presence of TLR-7 and MyD88, which induce IFN-\u03b1 expression via constitutively expressed IRF-7. Apparently, in contrast to the ubiquitous IRF-3 signaling chain, the pDC-restricted TLR-7/IRF-7 pathway is not affected by the virus. TLR-7 is located in endosomes of pDCs and may sense the viral genome during virus entry, or sense viral RNA that has been shuttled to endosomes by autophagosomes [120]. The TLR-7-dependent activation of pDCs most probably provides an important protective mechanism from coronavirus infection. Indeed, depletion of pDCs in mice significantly reduced serum IFN-\u03b1 levels, and led to increased virus replication, virus spread to multiple organs, and severe clinical signs of disease [92]. Thus, a weak type I IFN response early during coronavirus infection may explain why the prognosis for SARS worsens with increasing age, and it is feasible to suspect that the functionality and responsiveness of these professional IFN producers plays an important role in the protection from severe coronavirus-induced disease.",

Moreover, it is well known that the virulence and IFN resistance of MHV strains correlate [121]. In line with this, a recent study using SARS patient materials suggests the presence of high levels of type I IFNs which might be responsible for the recovery of the majority of patients [122]. Thus, the degree of IFN escape by coronaviruses may be host-specific as well as strain-specific and determine viral pathogenesis in a manner similar to what was observed, for e.g. Ebola virus [123], [124].",

            "text": "IRF-3 is not only crucial for IFN induction, but also participates in transactivation of the genes for RANTES [125] and IP-10 [126]. It could therefore be expected that coronaviruses also suppress production of these chemokines (which are also termed CCL5 and CXCL10, respectively). Recent data indicate that RANTES transcripts are indeed absent in tissue cells productively infected with SARS-CoV [107], [127] or MHV [103]. IP-10 transcription, however, is upregulated in some SARS-CoV-infected fibroblast cell lines [107], [127] and in macrophages [105]. Similarly, MHV induces a strong IP-10 response in mouse brain [128], mDCs and in pDCs [92], whereas type I IFNs are only produced in pDCs [92]. This suggests that transcription of IP-10 is (i) less dependent on IRF-3 than RANTES and IFN-\u03b2 are, and (ii) therefore largely unaffected by coronaviral inhibition mechanisms. Transactivation of the IP-10 gene is not only triggered by IRF-3, but also by the important transcription factor NF-\u03baB [126]. There are some reports that SARS-CoV [127], [129] and MHV [103], [130] trigger an NF-\u03baB response, although other groups could not verify these finding in their systems [104], [131]. Moreover, the SARS-CoV N protein is a strong antagonist of NF-\u03baB [113] and the NF-\u03baB-dependent proinflammatory TNF-\u03b1 is suspiciously absent in the SARS cytokine profile (see below). Activation of NF-\u03baB may therefore not be the final explanation for the upregulation of the IP-10 gene in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Indeed, recent reports indicate that IRF-5 can be activated by virus infection in a manner similar to IRF-3 [132], and that IRF-5 participates in induction of proinflammatory cytokines rather than type I IFNs [52], [133]. It can be speculated that IRF-5 is involved in the prominent upregulation of the IP-10 gene by SARS-CoV.",

Expression of IL-8 is dependent on the transcription factor AP-1, and molecular analyses revealed that SARS-CoV and MHV strongly activate AP-1 [103], [129], [135].

Interestingly, however, a recent study investigating immune responses of 40 clinically well-defined SARS cases revealed high levels of plasma IFN-\u03b1 (but not IFN-\u03b2) and an untypical ISG expression profile in pre-crisis patients, but not in the crisis patients [122].

Given the cell culture results for SARS-CoV, at least for IL-8 and IP-10 a direct production by virus-infected cells is conceivable. IL-6, however, is not or only weakly induced in productively infected tissue cells [107], [127], [154], [155] but moderately upregulated in abortively infected macrophages and DCs [156]. Interestingly, IL-6 induction by SARS-CoV could be strongly boosted by priming of macrophages with bacterial LPS [157]. Thus, it can be speculated that IL-8 and IP-10 in SARS patients are directly produced by virus-infected cells, whereas upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 is more likely a secondary response due to an activation of the immune system.",

It is debated whether the disease is caused by the virus or is the result of a dysregulated immune response. After primary infection, SARS-CoV grows at a fast rate and spreads to different organs, including the lungs [161], [164], [167]. Autopsies from deceased patients revealed severe damage of the lungs and lymphatic tissues, accompanied by infiltrations of monocytic cells [168], [169], [170]. This may indicate that immunopathogenesis is involved in the severe outcome of the disease, providing the rationale for SARS therapy with immunosuppressant corticosteroids [171]. On the other hand, cell damages could have been directly caused by the virus, as SARS-CoV is cytolytic [172], and high titers of virus have been found in several organs of deceased patients [160], [161], [173]. In addition, signs of necrosis were found besides virus particles in affected tissues [170], and high viral loads are predictive of adverse clinical outcome [174].",

In the initial phase of infection, dampening and misregulating the antiviral IFN response may allow the virus to grow rapidly and spread to different organs, including the lungs [161], [175]. The early IFN-\u03b1 detected in patients before the onset of disease [122] may be derived from pDCs which are capable of responding to SARS-CoV [92], whereas IFN-\u03b2 production by tissue cells is suppressed [102]. Thus, the virus buys time during the initial, critical phase of infection in order to establish itself in the host. At the same time, the virus-induced chemokines IP-10 and IL-8 attract immune cells. These invading cells can themselves be infected [161] and might produce even more chemokines and cytokines such as the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 [142], [156] and possibly also IFN-\u03b3 (which can induce even more IP-10) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-\u03b2 [139], [140], [146], [176]. This mixture of high-level virus replication followed by the invasion of activated immune cells and production of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may result in a cytokine storm which leads to organ destruction and exhaustion of the immune system, eventually culminating in the severe and often fatal respiratory distress, the hallmark of full-blown SARS.",

Characteristic by-products of virus replication such as dsRNA or 5\u2032triphosphorylated ssRNA lead to activation of the transcription factor IRF-3. Cooperative action with NF-\u03baB and AP-1 is required for full activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. IRF-3 is phosphorylated by the kinases TBK-1 and IKK\u025b (not shown) which in turn are activated by the RNA-sensing molecules RIG-I (recognizing 5\u2032 triphosphorylated ssRNA) and MDA-5 (recognizing dsRNA). PKR, which also recognizes dsRNA, is important for activating NF-\u03baB. AP-1 is activated by the stress-responsive kinase Jun. (B) Endosomal pathway. TLR7/8 and TLR3 recognize viral ssRNA and dsRNA, respectively, and activate IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 transcription via the transcription factors IRF-7, IRF-3, and NF-\u03baB. Only those parts of the pathways are depicted which are relevant for the discussion of coronaviral interactions (see main text).

Coronaviruses enter their host cells either on the plasma membrane or via endosomes where they could be recognized by TLR 3, 7, or 8. Note that MHV is shown to be recognized by TLR7 in pDCs [92]. Upon uncoating the capped viral ssRNA is released into the host cell cytoplasm and could be sensed by MDA-5 or PKR due to secondary structures containing dsRNA domains. Viral RNA synthesis takes place in or at double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and involves the appearance of dsRNA [43], again potentially recognized by MDA-5 and PKR. The negative-sense RNAs arising as an intermediate of DMV-associated genome replication and transcription are possibly 5\u2032-triphosphorylated and thus could be recognized by RIG-I. Finally, a nested set of viral mRNAs are released into the cytoplasm (putative sensors: MDA-5 or PKR) where they are translated. The full-length genomic RNA can also be translated and is eventually packaged into progeny virus particles which are released from the host cell via the exocytosis pathway.",
