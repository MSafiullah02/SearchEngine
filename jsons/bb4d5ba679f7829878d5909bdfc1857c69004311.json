Also, doping with metallic or non-metallic elements has an impact on the antibacterial and photocatalytic activity of these coatings. Although there are many studies in this field, the effect of co-doping with Cu and N and their concentrations on the antibacterial properties of TiO 2 coatings against the E. coli and S. aureus bacteria has not been studied. In the present investigation, the sol-gel method was employed to deposit both undoped and Cu-N co-doped TiO 2 photocatalytic coatings on glass surface, which are expected to degrade bacterial and chemical contaminants in water while exposed to visible sunlight wavelengths. Before the coating process, an appropriate heat treatment was applied on the samples and the quality of coatings, band gap energy, and also photocatalytic and antibacterial properties were evaluated. Results showed that, in the presence of dopants, the band gap become narrower and the absorption spectrum is transferred from the ultraviolet to the visible light range. Also, it was demonstrated that, under the visible light radiation, all of the co-doped samples show higher photocatalytic activity than the undoped ones. Meanwhile, the antibacterial characteristics of TiO 2 coatings was enhanced by increasing the dopant concentration when exposing to sunlight.",

Later in 1991, the Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology funded a project to evaluate SODIS as a solution to eliminate the household water impurities and to avoid diarrhea especially in developing countries [3] . It was recommended to expose bottles of water to sun waves for 6 h in sunny or 2 days in cloudy days. Illness-causing organisms would be deactivated as a result of ultraviolet (UV) light, thermal inactivation, and photo-oxidative destruction by this method [4, 5] . The photocatalytic activity of silver nanoparticles was investigated by Memon and his coworkers [6] . They indicated that the synthesized silver nanoparticles with and without the presence of sunlight demonstrates significant antimicrobial activities. They also suggested that the green synthesis of Ag nanoparticles can be alternative to the chemical methods and suitable for developing an easy process industrial production. Other similar works were also conducted by Memon and his coworkers regarding the photocatalytic activity and antimicrobial properties of different engineering materials [7] [8] [9] . The oxidizing effect of photo-generated holes in TiO 2 combined with its low price and relative physical and chemical stability make it a desirable option to be used in a plenty of applications such as a photocatalyst where degrading the organic pollutants into more eco-friendly chemical species occurs. Hence, TiO 2 is considered as a high-potential photocatalyst for water and air purification in addition to self-cleaning surfaces [10] . Besides, thanks to its high oxidation activity and superhydrophilicity, it can be used as an antibacterial agent [11] .",

            "text": "According to previous findings, undoped TiO 2 photocatalysts has shown relatively high photo-reactivity and self-sterilization properties under UV radiation. Moreover, it is desired to apply photocatalysts with high quantum yields under visible (Vis) light (>400 nm) in order to be able to trap the rest of the solar spectrum and obtain more efficient chemical contaminant degradation. A possible solution could be the doping of TiO 2 nanostructures to reach better photocatalytic properties under the sunlight. Doping TiO 2 would lead to higher photocatalytic properties if it could be applied on the surface with metals and/or nonmetal elements [12] [13] [14] . The increment on the surface-to-volume ratio in nanostructured layers results in higher reactive surface. Therefore, the surface adsorption and interfacial redox reactions can be empowered by applying nanostructured semiconductor coatings [15] . Substitution doping plays an important role to reduce the band gap of TiO 2 nanostructures and to absorb the higher fraction of solar radiation. Compositional doping is introduced to narrow the TiO 2 band gap. Considering the crystal structure of TiO 2 , it seems that replacement of Ti 4+ with any cation is easier than to substitute O 2\u2212 with any other anion due to the charge states and ionic radii difference [16, 17] . To exemplify the nonmetal doping of TiO 2 in anionic sites, doping by anionic species (N, S, C, B, P, I, or F) have been done [18, 19] . More precise calculations demonstrate the bandgap narrowing, which derives from the electronic perturbations caused by the deformation of lattice parameters and/ or by the presence of the trap states within conduction and valence bands of TiO 2 [20, 21] .",

In order to enhance either photocatalytic or antibacterial properties of TiO 2 nanoparticles, in the present work we prepared double doped TiO 2 with copper and nitrogen. We have investigated the effect of different concentration of dopants on the photocatalytic activities and antibacterial properties of the produced nanoparticles under Vis light and UV irradiation. Furthermore, the optimum amount of copper and nitrogen dopants was determined. For this reason, after preparation of TiO 2 coatings using sol-gel method, the different characteristics of coatings such as antibacterial properties, photocatalytic activity, the present phases, and crystallite sizes were evaluated.",

In order to apply undoped TiO 2 coating, the required sol, including tetrazinopropyl orutylateate dissolved in ethanol and chloridric acid as a catalyst, was prepared with a weight ratio of 1/30/1, respectively. For the main coating process, tetra-isopropyl ortho-titanate (C 12 H 28 O 4 Ti, as a titania precursor), tetrahydroethyl octosilicate (C 8 H 20 O 4 Si, as a SiO 2 precursor), copper nitrate (Cu 3 (NO 3 ) 2 , as a nitrogen precursor), and urea (CH 4 N 2 O, as a copper precursor) were used with 98% purity. The solvent was ethanol with 99.6% purity and the applied catalyst was HCl. Copper and nitrogen doping of the sols was achieved using copper nitrate and urea as dopant precursors. To synthesize N-Cu-TiO 2 , tetraezopropyl ortho-ethyl acetate, ethanol, and hydrochloric acid were weighed with 1/35/1 ratio. Then the precise amounts of copper nitrate and urea with different values (0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt% of TiO 2 ) were measured. Finally, half of the measured amount of ethanol was mixed with tetra-isopropyl ortho-titanate and hydrochloric acid, which was stirred and homogenized for 30 min by a magnetic stirrer (solution A). Half of the ethanol residue was mixed with copper nitrate and urea and dissolved with a magnetic stirrer for half an hour (solution B). Then solution A was added to this solution drop by drop and allowed to dissolve for a period of 3 h in the stirrer. Finally, the coatings were applied on the glass surface after keeping the prepared sol at room temperature for 24 h.

This temperature is about 480\u00b0C in undoped samples (Table 1) . So, by adding 0.5% dopants to titania, a big fall in crystallization temperature occurs, but by increasing the dopant concentration from 0.5% to 1% this change is not very significant. Considering the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2 , it is deduced that the only present phase in the coatings is anatase. Moreover, by increasing the dopant's concentration, the intensity of XRD peaks increases. Comparing the coating grain sizes obtained by Sherer's equation, it is concluded that the grain size is decreased by increasing the dopant concentration in the coating. The reason could rely on the blocking role of dopants during the grain growth in titania structure. Dopants' ions can substitute titanium and oxygen ions in the structure of titania and consequently cause a tensile stress, which could block the grain growth. Moreover, dopants can prevent the loss of anatase phase and its transformation into the rutile phase (according to XRD patterns). SEM micrographs of undoped and 1% Cu-N-doped samples clearly confirm the grain size reduction in co-doped coatings (Fig. 3) .",

In order to have more precise examination on the band gap energy, the tangent line on the absorption diagrams as a function of wavelength is plotted at the absorption edge (Fig. 4) . The first achieved result is that, in the presence of dopants, the absorption spectrum is transferred from the UV to the Vis light range (wave lengths >372 nm). The second fact is that, by increasing the dopants' value, the band gap energy is reduced, so the band gap becomes narrower ( Table 1 ). The reason is the creation of a subsidiary quantum level by dopant ions at the bottom of the conduction band and above the valence band in the titania structure. As a result, the relevant gap between the valence band and the conduction band and consequently the band gap energy is decreased.",

By drawing the C/C 0 as a function of time (as explained before), the amounts of removed colors caused by the photocatalytic activity of the coatings were obtained in different test durations. According to Fig. 5a , it is detected that, under the Vis light radiation, all of the co-doped samples show better photocatalytic activities than the undoped one, since the C value decreases with co-doping of TiO 2 coating with N and Cu atoms. Amazingly the 0.75% Cu-N sample has the best photocatalytic property, even better than the 1% Cu-N one. So a constant decreasing trend cannot be defined for this property. The suggested reason is that, by doping the coatings, the band gap gets narrower and the grain size becomes smaller, so the expected result is the improvement of photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, in 1% Cu-N sample, the recombination of electron-hole couples may speed up, which leads to lowering the photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, owing to shifting the absorption edge of co-doped sample to Vis region, the adverse trend occurs in the samples exposed to UV waves. It means that the co-doped samples show weaker photocatalytic activity compared to the undoped one (Fig. 5b) . Among all of the tested coatings, 0.5% Cu-N shows the best photocatalytic activity, which comes from its closest band gap energy to UV region.",

Examining the S. aureus diagram, the results obtained for samples exposed to methane halide (Fig. 6a) confirm the previously achieved results in photocatalytic activity tests in . 2 The X-ray diffraction patterns for TiO 2 pure film a and codoped coatings containing 0.5% b, 0.75% c and 1% d of Cu/N which 0.75% Cu-N coating shows the highest quality, while this trend is not seen in E. coli bacterial colonies (Fig. 6b) . It means that, by increasing the dopants' concentration, the relative activity in E. coli medium increases constantly. Also a small jump could be seen when switching from 0.75% Cu-N to 1% Cu-N point. In order to recheck the obtained results for S. aureus bacteria, once again the test has been done under the direct natural sunlight. The specimens were exposed to sunlight for 2 h from 12 to 2 p.m. with an average ambient temperature of 30\u00b0C. The UV radiation level was 9 (very high) and the sky was all clear during the whole test time. The specimens were then incubated for 24 h and finally bacterial colonies were enumerated to plot the relative activity graphs. As is seen in Fig. 6c , although the increasing trend was obvious, there was not much difference between the 0.75% Cu-N and 1% Cu-N points (the specimens of grown S. aureus bacteria are shown in Figs. 7 and 8) . The suggested mechanism to describe the antibacterial behavior is as below: the outer membrane of some bacterial structure is surrounded by a hydrocarbonate gelatinous layer, which protects the bacteria from environmental attacks to keep its pathogenic potential. If the bacteria lose this layer, it becomes harmless and acts like normal hydrocarbon contaminations in the air. While exposed to sunlight, the protective layer weakens and its molecular bonds get looser, so the bacterial colonies get disordered. Over time, the bond is completely broken, and the protective layer and membrane structure totally get destroyed. Finally, it is worth to note that photocatalytic oxidation, which generate superoxide (O 2 \u2212 ) and hydroxide radical (OH \u2212 ), could be harmful for human physiological system. Also, the use of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanoparticles has been reported to have led to pregnancy complications in mice and neurotoxicity in their offspring. Therefore, urgent evaluation of nanoparticles and their risk to human health is important, particularly in cosmetic and industrial areas where materials such as titanium dioxide are in regular use [32, 33] . There are methods for improving the performance and reducing toxicity of nanoparticles in medical design, such as biocompatible-coating materials or biodegradable/biocompatible nanoparticles. Most metal oxide nanoparticles show toxic effects, but no toxic effects have been observed with biocompatible coatings [34] .",

It means that by adding 0.5% dopants to titania we would have a big fall in crystallization temperature, meanwhile by increasing the dopant concentration (from 0.5% to 1%), this change is not very significant. -By evaluating the XRD patterns, the only detected phase in the coatings is anatase. Moreover, the grain size decreases with increasing the dopant concentration. -Comparing the band gap energies shows that, in the presence of dopants, the absorption spectrum is transferred from the UV to the Vis light range, and by increasing the dopants value, the band gap energy is reduced, so the band gap becomes narrower. -Considering the C/C 0 vs. time graphs, it is concluded that, under the Vis light radiation, all of the co-doped samples have higher photocatalytic activities than the undoped one, while the 0.75%Cu-N sample has the best photocatalytic activity, even better than the 1% Cu-N one. However, the adverse trend occurs in samples exposed to UV waves. -The number of colonies in samples exposed to the radiation of methane halide lamp confirms the obtained results of photocatalytic tests, in which 0.75% Cu-N coating shows the highest quality. However, this trend is not observed in E. coli bacteria colonies.",
