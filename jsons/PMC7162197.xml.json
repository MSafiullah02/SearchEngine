Outbreaks of H7 viruses have been reported in Galliformes in Australia (Selleck et al., 2003; Bulach et al., 2010), Germany (R\u00f6hm et al., 1996), Italy (Capua et al., 2002), Canada (Hirst et al., 2004; Pasick et al., 2005; Berhane et al., 2009), China (Li et al., 2006), the United Kingdom (Nguyen\u2010Van\u2010Tam et al., 2006), Chile (Spackman et al., 2006), the United States (Suarez et al., 1999; Spackman et al., 2003; Belser et al., 2009), and Pakistan (Abbas et al., 2010).

Viral molecular evolution associated with pathogenicity can occur via point mutations or intersegmental recombination (Hirst et al., 2004). Many suggest that three or more polybasic amino acid inserts 5\u2032 of the HA proteolytic cleavage site serves as a biomarker for pathogenicity (Chen et al., 1998; Steinhauer, 1999). However, recent studies have shown that this model is not universally applicable (R\u00f6hm et al., 1996; Senne et al., 1996; OIE, 2009; Uchida et al., 2011). While acknowledging improvements in molecular understanding of viral pathogenicity, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE [Office International des Epizooties]) uses animal testing to assess pathogenicity. Pathogenic viruses are classified as such when they cause 75% mortality in chicks that have been inoculated with a strain of interest (Alexander, 2003; OIE, 2009).",

Supramap is distinct from tree visualization systems because we use POY (Var\u00f3n et al., 2010), which can search for alignments and/or trees, diagnose trees, and output data on mutations and/or phenotypic changes. As a result, users from around the world have used Supramap to investigate such diverse topics as the biogeography of plant pathogens (Lokossou et al., 2010), the integration of biodiversity and evolutionary biology (Hendry et al., 2010), ecogeographic genetic epidemiology (Sloan et al., 2009), and human cultural evolution (Wheeler et al., 2011).",

Sequences were aligned with ClustalW (Larkin et al., 2007) and both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends were trimmed manually to remove sequencing artefacts. The resulting dataset had 878 pre\u2010aligned sequences. We used the oldest isolate, A/chicken/Brescia/1902, as the outgroup.

Second, another web method uploads each file. Third, a method submits the job via the scheduler on the HPC resource via qsub (a command of portable batch system). Fourth, a method is provided for the client to call periodically to see if the job completes. Fifth, a method is used to retrieve the output files. There is a sixth, optional method that serves to clean up after a run by deleting the directory created during initialization. The initialization method can be modified such that alternative resources (e.g. a scheduled supercomputer or dedicated cluster) can be selected as a parameter.
