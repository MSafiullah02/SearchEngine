A common keystone property is the presence of a threshold behavior defining the transition between a macroscopic-level spreading regime and one characterized by a null or negligibly small contagion of individuals. Known as the epidemic threshold in the realm of infectious disease dynamics [1], the concept is analogous to the phase transition in nonequilibrium physical systems [7,8], and is also central in social contagion processes [5,9\u201313].",

The recent availability of data on time-resolved contacts of epidemic relevance [19] has, however, challenged the time scale separation, showing it may introduce important biases in the description of the epidemic spread [19\u201333] and in the characterization of the transition behavior [31,34\u201337]. Departing from traditional approximations, few novel approaches are now available that derive the epidemic threshold constrained to specific contexts of generative models of temporal networks [22,32,35,38\u201341] or considering generic discrete-time evolving contact patterns [42\u201344]. In particular, the recently introduced infection propagator approach [43,44] is based on a matrix encoding the probabilities of transmission of the infective agent along time-respecting paths in the network. Its spectrum allows the computation of the epidemic threshold at any given time scale and for an arbitrary discrete-time temporal network. Leveraging an original mapping of the temporal network and epidemic spread in terms of a multilayer structure, the approach is valid in the discrete representation only, similarly to previous methods [17,18,35].",

Most importantly, the two representations\u2014continuous and discrete\u2014of a temporal network remain disjointed in current network epidemiology. A discrete-time evolving network is indeed a multilayer object interpretable as a tensor in a linear algebraic representation [49]. This is clearly no longer applicable when time is continuous, as it cannot be expressed in the form of successive layers. Hence, a coherent theoretical framework to bridge the gap between the two representations is still missing.",

Formally, we show that the dichotomy discrete time\u2013continuous time translates into the separation between a linear algebraic approach and a differential one, and that the latter can be derived as the structural limit of the former. Our approach yields a solution for the threshold of epidemics spreading on generic continuously evolving networks, and a closed form under a specific condition that is then validated through numerical simulations. In addition, the proposed novel perspective allows us to cast an important set of network classes into one single rigorous and comprehensive mathematical definition, including annealed [4,50,51] and activity-driven [35,52] networks, widely used in both methodological and applied research.",

The SIS model constitutes a basic paradigm for the description of epidemics with reinfection [1]. Infectious individuals (I) can propagate the contagion to susceptible neighbors (S) with rate \u03bb, and recover to the S state with rate \u03bc. The temporal network is described by the adjacency matrix A(t), with t\u2208[0,T]. We consider a discretized version of the system by sampling A(t) at discrete time steps of length \u0394t (Fig. 1). This yields a finite sequence of adjacency matrices {A1,A2,\u2026,ATstep}, where Tstep=\u230aT/\u0394t\u230b, and Ah=A(h\u0394t). The sequence approximates the original continuous-time network with increasing accuracy as \u0394t decreases. We describe the SIS dynamics on this discrete sequence of static networks as a discrete-time Markov chain [17,18]: ph+1,i=(1-ph,i)[1-\u220fj(1-\u03bb\u0394tAh,jiph,j)]+ph,i(1-\u03bc\u0394t),(1)where ph,i is the probability that a node i is in the infectious state at time step h, and \u03bc\u0394t (\u03bb\u0394t) is the probability that a node recovers (transmits the infection) during a time step \u0394t, for sufficiently small \u0394t.",

It is important to note that the limit process leading to Eq. (4) entails a fundamental change of paradigm on the representation of the network structure and contagion process, where the linear algebraic representation suitable in discrete time turns into a differential geometrical description of the continuous-time flow. While network and spreading dynamics in discrete time are encoded in a multilayer adjacency tensor, the continuous time description proposed in Eq. (5) rests on a representation of the dynamical process in terms of a manifold whose points are adjacency matrices (or a rank-2 tensor in the sense of Ref. [49]) corresponding to possible network and contagion states. The dynamics of Eq. (5) is then a curve on such a manifold, indicating which adjacency matrices to visit and in which order. In practice, we recover that the contagion process on a discrete temporal network corresponding to an ordered subset of the full multilayer structure of Ref. [49] becomes in the limit \u0394t\u21920 a spreading on a continuous temporal network represented through a one-dimensional ordered subset of a tensor field (formally the pullback on the evolution curve). The two frameworks, so far considered independently and mutually exclusive, thus merge coherently through a smooth transition in this novel perspective.",
