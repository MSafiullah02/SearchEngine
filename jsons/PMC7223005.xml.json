            "text": "Sepsis is a major cause of mortality in critically ill patients, including severely burned patients (Manning 2018; Nitzschke et al. 2017). The diagnosis of sepsis in such patients is a limiting step in successful treatment. In severely burned patients, this diagnosis is particularly difficult, since the common clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis are masked by a baseline hypermetabolism (Nunez Lopez et al. 2017; Parent et al. 2016; Peltz et al. 2015), as well as an inflammatory immune response (Bortolotti et al. 2018). Laboratory testing for substantiation of sepsis is based on a combination of host reactants that are elevated during the acute phase immune response, which can be caused by infectious or immune inflammatory diseases, cancer, or trauma; and blood cells and metabolites that are altered during sepsis, septic shock, and/or organ dysfunction caused by sepsis (Biron et al. 2015; Bortolotti et al. 2018). Tests for the acute phase reactants C-reactive protein and procalcitonin have been standardized and are widely used for diagnosis of inflammation related to infection and predicting progression to sepsis, respectively (Biron et al. 2015; Fleischmann-Struzek et al. 2018; Markanday 2015). Similarly, levels of the metabolite lactate have been standardized for indication of sepsis and septic shock (Rhee et al. 2015). Levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which stimulate the production of the acute phase reactants, offer potential for additional markers to diagnose sepsis (Sun et al. 2015). The use of Fc-gamma receptor-1 (CD64) and high-mobility group box 1 protein are undergoing research for feasibility in assessment of sepsis in humans, but are not currently available (Hatada et al. 2005; Livaditi et al. 2006; Markanday 2015). Although blood cultures are recommended for diagnosis of the etiologic agent of sepsis, their results are negative in at least 50% of patients with sepsis (de Prost et al. 2013). Failure to recover a microorganism could be due to low microbial load in the bloodstream, prior treatment of the patient with antibiotics, or presence of an organism that cannot be grown in conventional blood culture (virus, parasite, or fastidious, slow-growing bacterium). However, sepsis can also be diagnosed by confirming an infection in the urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, a surgical site, or other body fluid (CSF, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, etc.) in a patient with signs and symptoms of sepsis (Comstedt et al. 2009; Heffner et al. 2010). Additionally, a noninfectious etiology, such as pancreatitis, cancer, autoimmune inflammatory disease, or burns or other trauma including surgery, is found for 18\u201338% of patients presenting with sepsis symptoms (Comstedt et al. 2009; de Prost et al. 2013; Heffner et al. 2010), a diagnosis often referred to as the noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (niSIRS) (Cabrera et al. 2017; Mearelli et al. 2018; Watt et al. 2015). Thus, identifying specific biomarkers for sepsis is an area of significant research interest. This will help differentiating between the various agents and conditions associated with sepsis, since numerous microbial species can be the cause (Gauer 2013). Also, the rise in multidrug resistance in certain species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa makes it harder to empirically treat infected patients prior to knowing the cause; yet delay in initiating appropriate antibiotic treatment can substantially increase mortality in patients suffering from sepsis (Liu et al. 2017; Micek et al. 2005).",

P. aeruginosa can spread systemically from localized infections at different body sites, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or wound infection (Bassetti et al. 2018). We used a murine model of thermal injury and metabolomic analysis of serum to search for biomarkers specific for sepsis caused by dissemination of P. aeruginosa from infected burn wounds. We hypothesized that during sepsis, P. aeruginosa affects the metabolome of the blood by either consuming specific metabolites, thus decreasing their concentration; or by producing other metabolites, consequently increasing their concentration. These metabolites would be indicative of P. aeruginosa bloodstream infection and could represent potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of sepsis caused by P. aeruginosa. In this study, we identified a set of 26 metabolites related to amino acid and protein metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyrimidine metabolism, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, including two unique to this study \u2013 trans-4-hydroxyproline and glycerol-3-galactoside, that have the potential to serve as novel biomarkers for P. aeruginosa causing sepsis in severely burned patients.",

Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 5% sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal; Diamondback Drugs, Scottsdale, AZ) at 5 mg/mL and their backs were shaved. The mice were placed in a template that exposes approximately 15% of the total body surface area and the exposed surface was placed in 90 \u00b0C water for 8 s. Such an injury is nonlethal but results in a full-thickness burn. Mice were immediately resuscitated with fluid replacement therapy. For those mice to be infected with PA14, 100 \u03bcL of PBS containing approximately 200 CFU was injected directly under the injured skin. Four groups of mice were used in these experiments: thermally injured and infected (B\u2013I), the experimental group; and three control groups \u2013 non-injured and non-infected (NB\u2013NI), the sham control; non-injured but infected (NB\u2013I); and thermally injured but not infected (B\u2013NI). After 24 h, mice in all groups were anesthetized and approximately 1 mL of blood was collected via cardiac puncture. Livers and spleens were harvested from the exsanguinated mice.",

Thus, the B\u2013I group, the 24-h time point represents early or uncomplicated sepsis as the animals had BSI with dissemination to internal organs but were not yet moribund or dead. Without intervention PA14 has been shown to cause 100% mortality from sepsis at 48 h (Dzvova et al. 2018; Rahme et al. 1995). In contrast, the B\u2013NI control group represents the effect of trauma without infection (similar to niSIRS).",

To define the metabolomic changes caused by P. aeruginosa-related sepsis following thermal injury, we used PCA and HCA, two forms of multivariate analysis. The PCA showed good separation between the samples from the B\u2013I (Pa-sepsis) group and the control groups (Fig. 1a). The NB\u2013NI (sham) and NB\u2013I (infection without trauma) groups overlapped almost completely. This overlap is most likely due to the fact that uninjured mice do not become infected with PA14 following subcutaneous inoculation (Online Resource 1). Repeat PCA without the NB\u2013I group showed that it may be possible to also identify metabolites that separate the B\u2013I (Pa-sepsis) and B\u2013NI (niSIRS) groups from each other (Fig. 1b). These results were confirmed by HCA, which showed two main branches on the dendrogram, with one branch representing the B\u2013I experimental group and the other branch representing the control groups (Fig. 1c).",

We then narrowed the pool of candidate biomarkers by focusing only on those that distinguished the B\u2013I group (Pa-sepsis) from the B\u2013NI group (niSIRS) resulting in a pool of 35 potential biomarkers.

Due to the small number of samples in our study, we applied a cut-off of \u2265 0.96 for the AUC. For 25 metabolites, the AUC were determined to be 1 (1.0) (95% confidence interval calculated using 500 bootstraps), indicating these metabolites could be considered predictive of Pa-sepsis (Table 1). Two metabolites not selected in our first analysis \u2013 tagatose and taurine (Table 1)\u2014were included in the 25. Taurine had been selected as statistically significant in subsequent analyses of the data (Figs. 2 and 3b), but tagatose was shown not to be useful for discriminating Pa-sepsis from niSIRS (Online Resource 5). The AUC for five metabolites was 0.96 (glycerol-3-galactoside, fructose, phosphoenolpyruvate, tyrosine, and 5-methyltryptamine), suggesting that they might also be predictive (Fig. 3, Online Resource 5). However, as for tagatose, statistical analyses did not support 5-methyltryptamine as a potential biomarker for Pa-sepsis. Five of the original metabolites (glycolate, lactate, oxalate, p-tolyl glucuronide, and conduritol-\u03b2-epoxide) were eliminated by their AUC (Table 1). One metabolite with an AUC of 1.0, 3-ureidopropionate, had produced variable results in statistical analyses of the relative peak intensity data. Further analysis of the peak intensities without the NB\u2013I group and using the B\u2013I group as comparator revealed significant differences similar to those of uracil and uridine (Table 1). Interrogation of the Human Metabolome Database showed that 4-methylbenzenesulfonamide and 3,6-anhydro-D-galactose (as well as conduritol-\u03b2-epoxide) have been found in mice but not in humans. These metabolites were removed from consideration. The final set of 26 metabolites for consideration as potential diagnostic biomarkers of sepsis from P. aeruginosa included nine amino acids and their metabolites; seven sugars, sugar phosphates, and sugar acids; five pyrimidines and derivatives; three fatty acid and lipid metabolites; and two intermediates of the TCA cycle (Table 1).",

Pathway enrichment analysis for the metabolites revealed seven pathways with significant changes \u2013 six related to carbohydrate metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4a). To further discover any possible metabolite-metabolite interaction, we used the network explorer function within MetaboAnalyst followed by application of NetworkAnalyst software (Zhou et al. 2019). This analysis supported the previous results, showing that the pathway for pyrimidine metabolism (metabolites thymidine, thymine, uridine, and uracil) was the most notable pathway (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4b).",

We demonstrated that only thermally injured mice infected with P. aeruginosa developed sepsis within 24 h (Online Resource 1). The GC-TOF-MS analysis of murine sera showed a difference in the abundance of numerous metabolites during P. aeruginosa-related sepsis compared to control groups. Similar to previously reported studies, we found differential abundance of amino acids, metabolites of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, pyrimidines, fatty acids and lipids, and the TCA cycle (Figs. 2 and 3) (Hoerr et al. 2012; Lin et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2010; Ludwig and Hummon 2017; Wei et al. 2016). Differences in models, including the protocol used to induce sepsis (infection of burn wound, intraperitoneal injection, or cecal ligation and puncture [CLP]), the organism(s) used (P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli, or mixed infection from CLP), timing of harvest of samples (4 h post infection, 12 h, or 24 h), and methods used to detect metabolites (LC/MS versus 1H NMR versus GC/MS) makes it difficult to directly compare the entire sets of results from these different studies. In several studies, the majority of reported metabolites constituted acylcarnitines and lipid molecules best discovered by LC/MS (Lin et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2010; Wei et al. 2016), which makes it difficult to compare the metabolites we detected by GC-TOF/MS. However, Hoerr et al. (Hoerr et al. 2012), who used 1H- NMR, found 43 metabolites differentially abundant in mice infected with P. aeruginosa by intraperitoneal injection compared to the 56 we found in mice with P. aeruginosa burn wound infections (Fig. 2) (Hoerr et al. 2012). We found 35 metabolites in common with their study, but only 10 were similar in levels; notably, glucose was reduced in both studies and amino acids and protein metabolites were found in similar abundance: 2-hydroxybutyrate, creatinine, taurine and phenylalanine were elevated while asparagine was reduced and isoleucine, alanine and glutamine were detected but levels were the same in sepsis and controls (Online Resource 4) (Hoerr et al. 2012). Thus, comparison of functional groups of metabolites or even individual metabolites provides a way to determine which metabolites might be used for the diagnosis of sepsis related to P. aeruginosa.",

            "text": "Among the metabolites that were increased in the blood of thermally-injured mice septic with P. aeruginosa were thymidine, thymine, uridine, and uracil, which are involved in pyrimidine metabolism (Fig. 3a). These nucleobases and nucleosides serve fundamental roles in the replication of genetic material, gene transcription, protein synthesis, and cellular metabolism. Thymine and uracil are incorporated into DNA and RNA, respectively, during their synthesis. Uracil was among nine metabolites identified by Liu et al. that were changed when thermally injured rats became septic (Liu et al. 2010). While we did not identify all nine of their markers, two \u2013gluconate and uric acid \u2013 followed the same pattern of increase in the septic animals and decrease in the animals that were thermally injured only (Online Resource 4) (Liu et al. 2010). It has been demonstrated that uracil influences quorum sensing and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa by enhancing transcription of quorum sensing genes with subsequent increase in biofilm formation (Ueda et al. 2009). Since uracil was only increased in the B\u2013I group, PA14 dissemination preceded the increase in uracil. Whether the increase in serum uracil would then help those PA14 organisms remaining in the wound to establish biofilm, leading to more dissemination, is not known at this time. P. aeruginosa can also utilize pyrimidines as a carbon and/or nitrogen source (West and Chu 1986). Interestingly, 3-ureidopropionate, which is a metabolite of uracil, was identified by ROC analysis as a distinguishing marker in septic mice (Table 1, Online Resource 3).",

While the release of trans-4-hydroxyproline could occur with tissue injury, the level was reduced in the B\u2013NI group compared to the NB\u2013NI group (Online Resource 4). P. aeruginosa is known to be able to degrade collagen (Hao et al. 1999). The increase in trans-4-hydroxyproline in the B\u2013I group, compared to all control groups, is most likely a result of the collagen degradation happening when P. aeruginosa invaded the tissue and disseminated. Werth\u00e9n et al. (2004) showed that P. aeruginosa degrades the collagen in skin biopsies within hours of inoculation (Werth\u00e9n et al. 2004). Moreover, P. aeruginosa, which can use trans-4-hydroxyproline as a carbon and nitrogen source, has an uptake system for it that is induced by the presence of the molecule (Li and Lu 2016).",

They found some compounds such as cyclopentanone were produced by both organisms individually and in co-culture; some were produced by P. aeruginosa alone and in co-culture (1-undecene, pyrrole, methyl 2-ethylhexanoate) and some by E. cloacae alone but greatly reduced in co-culture (2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-phenylethanol) (Lawal et al., 2018). Other compounds were found elevated only in co-culture\u2014methyl 2-methylbutyrate, isoamyl butyrate, 2-methylbutyl acetate (Lawal et al. 2018).

The TCA cycle is used by aerobic organisms to release stored energy. Meylan et al. (2017) showed that TCA cycle activity drives the lethality of the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin in P. aeruginosa (Meylan et al. 2017). They found that supplementation of media with fumarate and succinate, components of the lower part of the TCA cycle, sensitized stationary-phase cells to killing by tobramycin (Meylan et al. 2017). In contrast, components of the upper TCA cycle such as citrate had little effect (Meylan et al. 2017). Numerous metabolites found as components of the TCA cycle were detected in our metabolomics profiles, including significantly increased levels of succinate and malate (Figs. 2 and 3), as well as the presence of citrate, isocitrate, cis-aconitate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, and fumarate (Online Resources 2 and 4). Besides serving as markers for sepsis, the increased levels of specific TCA cycle metabolites might be useful in predicting alterations in tobramycin susceptible phenotype.",

It was recently shown that the mannose level also increases in the blood of trauma patients and that P. aeruginosa can sense that increase and upregulate its mannose transport system to use the sugar as a carbon source (Elmassry et al. 2019). Compared to controls, fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) were found at significantly higher levels in B\u2013I mice, 4.7-fold and 18-fold, respectively; while glucose was found to be significantly lower (\u2212 2.3-fold). Moreover, the average ratio of glucose to G6P in septic mice was 1:23, a drop of 47-fold compared to the average ratio of 1:1090 in the three control groups.

            "text": "Interest in, and understanding of, the fluidity of the human metabolome in response to different conditions has led to analyses looking for changes in metabolite abundance related to general demographics such as age, sex, and race (Lawton et al. 2008) as well as studies focused on specific metabolic responses present in a specific disease; such as examination of the metabolome to study pathophysiology of oxidative stress in cancer (Andrisic et al. 2018). Because of the lethal nature of sepsis and the rapidity with which it can kill, and because current markers such as serum lactate, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin have been shown to be insufficiently discriminating (Mann et al. 2011; Rhee et al. 2015), there has been much interest in metabolomics as a means to identify markers that could better predict which patients with sepsis are likely to progress to severe sepsis, septic shock, and/or succumb (Ferrario et al. 2016; Holder et al. 2016; Langley et al. 2014, 2013; Seymour et al. 2013; Su et al. 2014). Additionally, analysis of the metabolome has been used to determine which patients with signs and symptoms of sepsis are truly septic or are suffering from noninfectious SIRS (Schmerler et al. 2012). As with the studies in animal models, differences in types of infections (bloodstream versus pneumonia), timing (< 4 h post admittance to 24 h to 3\u20137 days), and methods of detection of metabolites make comparison of the studies difficult. Comparing sepsis survivors and nonsurvivors to patients with niSIRS, Langley et al. (Langley et al. 2014) found that patients who survived sepsis had lower levels of malate, phosphate, and ketogenic amino acids, while nonsurvivors had higher levels of lactate, malate, phosphate, and glucogenic amino acids and lower levels of glucose. In our study the B\u2013I mice will become sepsis nonsurvivors while the B\u2013NI mice represent the niSIRS group. Compared to B\u2013NI mice, the B\u2013I mice had significantly higher levels of malate and lactate and lower levels of glucose, but the phosphate levels were elevated in both over sham (normal) controls similar to the nonsurvivors (Fig. 3, Online Resource 5). Levels of the ketogenic amino acids leucine and tyrosine were significantly reduced as were levels of the glucogenic amino acid methionine (Fig. 3, Table 1), similar to their survivors (Langley et al. 2014). Whether testing at 48 h (near the usual time of death in the model) would result in a shift in the levels of phosphate and amino acids closer to those observed in the nonsurvivors is not known at this time. Although Langley et al. (Langley et al. 2014) reported no differences in metabolomic profiles for the types of pathogens present in their sepsis patients, it is also possible that the changes in amino acid levels could reflect the growth of P. aeruginosa in the B\u2013I mice. Ferrario et al. (2016) also compared sepsis survivors at day 7 to their profiles on day 1, and nonsurvivors at day 7 to survivors at day 7. We detected three of the metabolites considered significant in the survivors at day 7\u2014 \u201csugars,\u201d serine, and creatinine\u2014with the exact opposite results; sugars and serine were reduced while creatinine was elevated in the B\u2013I mice (Figs. 2, 3, Online Resource 4) (Ferrario et al. 2016). Amino acids were the major metabolites significantly different in the nonsurvivors at day 7 (Ferrario et al. 2016). We detected all six of the amino acids, but the levels for the two amino acids that were significantly different in our septic mice (asparagine and tyrosine) were opposite \u2013 reduced rather than elevated (Figs. 2, 3, and Online Resource 4) (Ferrario et al. 2016). Since there was no mention of specific pathogens isolated from the septic patients, the levels of metabolites we observed may reflect the growth of P. aeruginosa. Unfortunately, many of the metabolites reported in the human metabolome studies on sepsis were detected by LC/MS and constitute phosphocholines, glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins, and acylcarnitines, which are not detected by GC/MS, the method we used (Ferrario et al. 2016; Schmerler et al. 2012; Su et al. 2014). Despite the similarity of methodology within those studies, it is interesting that few, if any, of the metabolites identified as potential biomarkers were the same from one study to the next (Ferrario et al. 2016; Schmerler et al. 2012; Su et al. 2014). What we found in common with these studies is that, despite the differences in approaches, we identified metabolites from the same metabolic pathways.",

Additionally, 24 intermediate metabolites within these pathways were also detected among the 148 identified metabolites, although the changes in their levels were not found to be significant enough to be considered among the diagnostic biomarkers (Fig. 5). Certainly, a substantial disturbance in metabolism occurs during sepsis from dissemination of P. aeruginosa from local infection, which emphasizes the value of this approach to identify new potential markers of sepsis.",

This unique group, together with selected metabolites from pyrimidine, glucose, and fatty acid metabolism and the TCA cycle (e.g., uracil, glucose-6-phosphate, nonadecanoic acid, malate, and succinate (Fig. 3) that were the most discriminatory for Pa-sepsis from niSIRS may have the potential to serve as diagnostic biomarkers for sepsis caused by P. aeruginosa in severely burned patients.",

Among the analyzed metabolites, 26 metabolites were shown to have high predictive power for P. aeruginosa sepsis following thermal injury. It is very clear that these changes in the metabolome occurred only with thermal injury plus infection. Examination of sepsis following infection of burn wounds by other microbes such as the Gram-positive coccus S. aureus and the Gram-negative bacillus Acinetobacter baumannii would help establish the specificity of these metabolites as markers for bacterial sepsis in general, Gram-negative bacterial sepsis, or for the individual organism. The latter would be most helpful in early diagnosis as it would assist in the determination of appropriate antibiotic therapy. While we used an untargeted metabolomics approach to detect as many metabolites as possible, once a set of markers is established and validated in humans, shifting to a targeted approach of identifying just those specific \u201cP. aeruginosa sepsis\u201d metabolites would be the next step. Alternatively, should a specific pathway be confirmed as predictive, such as the pyrimidine metabolic pathway, then detection and quantitation of those metabolites could be sufficient.",
