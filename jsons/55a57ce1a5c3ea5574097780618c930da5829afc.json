Candida albicans is part of the normal oral flora, but in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with low numbers of CD4 + T cells, C. albicans causes thrush and esophagitis. Similarly, virtually all immunologically normal individuals chronically infected with human cytomegalovirus (CMV) are asymptomatic, but CMV can cause colitis and pneumonia when the immune system is suppressed. It has been suggested that chronic infection with highly prevalent viruses, including herpesviruses, may play a protective role against bacterial infection by boosting innate immunity, implying a complex, three-way relationship that defies easy classification. 27 Thus, the host and its indigenous microflora maintain a delicately balanced relationship that, when disrupted, may lead to the development of infectious disease.

Several viral proteins may be required to mediate attachment, viral fusion and entry into the cell. For example, the HIV gp120 protein first attaches to the CD4 molecule on the cell surface, exposing an area of gp120 that interacts with a seven-loop transmembrane protein co-receptor, triggering fusion via a portion of the gp41 transmembrane protein. In rotavirus, too, different viral proteins interact with membrane carbohydrates, integrins and a heat shock protein to mediate attachment and entry. 37 For some viruses (typically enveloped viruses, including measles and mumps viruses 38 ), attachment proceeds via direct fusion with the cell plasma membrane. These virions have a transmembrane fusion protein that induces contact between the viral and cellular lipid bilayers. Alternatively, attachment may trigger endocytosis, proceeding through clathrin-coated pits, frequently involving acidification of the vesicle to trigger structural changes in viral proteins that result in exceptions. Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which causes pharyngitis, and Bordetella pertussis, which causes whooping cough, produce their illnesses via locally released toxins. Some strains of Staph. aureus carry a gene on a mobile genetic element that encodes a super-antigen (TSST-1) that can be absorbed from a mucosal surface and precipitate 'toxic shock' .

S. enterica and Shigella spp. are examples of bacteria that induce their own engulfment using type III secretion systems to rearrange the host cell cytoskeleton by injecting proteins that mimic host enzymes through the host cell membrane, resulting in actin rearrangement so that the bacteria are carried into the cell (Figure 2-7) . The bacteria inject additional enzymes that restore the cytoskeleton to its original shape and restore cellular integrity.

There are both intraepithelial lymphocytes and localized lymphoid follicles that are covered by membranous cells (M cells) that play a prominent role in intestinal immunity because they are specialized in the transport of antigens. Enteroinvasive viruses, protozoa and bacteria adhere to M cells and exploit their transport functions to invade the host.

Membranous cells produce glycocalyx containing distinctive lectin-binding sites. Diversity in lectin-binding sites between different locations of the gut may account for the tropism of enteric pathogens, such as the preferential colonization of colonic mucosa by Shigella spp., versus the terminal ileum for Salmonella spp. Following adherence, the interactions with the M cells vary according to the pathogen (Figure 2-8) .

Recent influenza A pandemics occurred in 1957 (the H2N2 'Asian Flu'), 1968 (the H3N2 'Hong Kong Flu') and most recently in 2009, when an unanticipated, novel H1N1 influenza A virus originating from circulating seasonal influenza, avian, and classic and Eurasian swine strains emerged. 75 In 1997, avian influenza A/H5N1 caused 18 human deaths; a different strain of A/H5N1 has circulated in domestic birds throughout Asia, causing 387 cases and 245 deaths between 2003 and 2008. In the past decade, human infection by H7N2 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses had raised concerns, and H7N9 virus caused severe respiratory infections and death in China in 2013, posing the threat of a future pandemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 807, "end": 809, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Shift and Drift in Influenza A Viruses"}, {"text": "African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei) are flagellated protozoa, transmitted to humans by several species of Glossina (tsetse flies).

(b) A switch mechanism is responsible for the (mutually exclusive) production of type A and type B flagella in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Phase variation depends on the orientation of a DNA fragment adjacent to the type A flagella gene. When A is expressed (i) from the promoter in the invertible fragment, the repressor for the type B flagella is expressed at the same time.As a consequence the type B flagella gene is repressed. Inversion of the DNA fragment abolishes expression of the A-repressor gene and the B-repressor gene (ii). In this situation type B flagella are produced. (c) Antigenic shift by gene reassortment results from infection of a single cell by two different virions.

Other proteins encoded by the sap locus (SapB, SapC and SapD) are required for the transport of the SapA-antimicrobial peptide complex into the cytosol where the antimicrobial peptide is degraded.

L. pneumophila provokes entry in mononuclear phagocytes by accumulating the opsonin C3bi on the outer membrane. Macrophages ingest the bacteria via the receptor CR3. Following uptake, Legionella remains in phagosomes, which do not fuse with lysosomes thus providing a refuge for the bacteria. Alveolar macrophages are host cells for M. tuberculosis.66 S. enterica are ingested by intraepithelial dendritic cells and carried into regional lymph nodes and the systemic circulation by those cells.
