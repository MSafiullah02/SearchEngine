Until 2003, human coronaviruses were responsible for only mild respiratory diseases, mainly common colds. This changed with the emergence of a highly pathogenic coronavirus associated with a severe respiratory syndrome, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In 2012, a new deadly human coronavirus emerged in the Arabian Peninsula, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) responsible for severe pneumonia that can be associated with additional clinical symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea or renal failure (Alhogbani, 2016, Zaki et al., 2012). The MERS-CoV epidemic is still ongoing, and so far more than 1700 laboratory-confirmed cases have been diagnosed with a mortality rate of approximately 35%. There are neither clinically approved antivirals nor vaccines available against MERS-CoV and therapeutic options for MERS-CoV infections are limited to palliative and supportive care.",

            "text": "The MERS-CoV spike protein is a main determinant of virus entry into host cells as it mediates both binding to the DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4) receptor and fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membrane (Millet and Whittaker, 2014, Raj et al., 2013). It is a type I fusion protein and is highly glycosylated with 19 predicted N-glycosylation sites. One option to block MERS-CoV infection is to take advantage of the highly glycosylated nature of its spike protein by using lectins in order to inhibit MERS-CoV entry and thus virus propagation. Griffithsin (GRFT) is a 121 amino acid long lectin that was isolated from the red marine alga Griffithsia sp. Griffithsin has been shown to have antiviral activity against HIV-1 within the picomolar range (Mori et al., 2005). Characterization of griffithsin structure has demonstrated that it is a domain-swapped homodimer with three carbohydrate binding domains on each monomer that bind to terminal mannose residues linked on HIV envelope protein gp120 N-glycans (Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska et al., 2006). Griffithsin has also been identified as a potent inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and SARS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo with minimal toxicity (Meuleman et al., 2011, O'Keefe et al., 2010). Therefore, we evaluated the anti-MERS-CoV activity of griffithsin.",

Huh-7, MRC-5, and Vero-81 cells were infected with strain EMC/2012 of MERS-CoV at an m.o.i. of 10 in presence of increasing concentrations of griffithsin (0\u20132 \u03bcg/mL). The infected cells were fixed at an early infection time point (9 h) and assayed by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis (Fig. 1C) followed by quantification of the percentage of infected cells for each concentration (Fig. 1D). Griffithsin significantly decreased infectivity by MERS-CoV, with a clear, dose-dependent inhibitory effect in all cell lines tested (Fig. 1C and D). Even at the most diluted concentration of 0.125 \u03bcg/mL tested, the inhibitory activity of griffithsin on MERS-CoV infection was significant, with a minimal drop of 44.7% in infectivity for Huh-7 cells and a maximal drop of 63.2% for Vero-81 cells compared to the condition without the lectin. At 2 \u03bcg/mL, griffithsin inhibited viral infectivity by more than 90% in all cell lines tested. Because we have performed our assay using high m.o.i. and a short infection time, these results show the strong inhibitory activity of griffithsin on early steps of the MERS-CoV viral cycle.",

To confirm the results obtained with MERS-CoV and determine the activity of this molecule on entry mediated by MERS-CoV spike protein, MERS-CoV pseudotyped virions (MERSpp) were produced and used to infect Huh-7 cells. A dose-dependent inhibition of MERSpp infection was observed in the presence of griffithsin (Fig. 3\nA) suggesting that this compound is able to inhibit MERS-CoV entry. As expected, griffithsin was also able to inhibit HCVpp infection and had no effect on VSV-Gpp infection as previously described (Meuleman et al., 2011). Griffithsin is known to interact with N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides. The antiviral effect of this compound was shown to be due to the interactions of griffithsin with the mannoses linked to the viral envelope protein (Moulaei et al., 2010). To confirm that the inhibition observed is specific of griffithsin activity, a competition assay using N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides mannonose-di-(N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) (Man-9 Glycan) was performed. As shown in Fig. 3B, incubation of MERSpp with griffithsin preincubated first with Man-9 Glycan significantly restores the infectivity of pseudotyped particles which suggests that griffithsin interacts with mannoses of MERS-CoV S envelope and impairs its functions during entry. To further confirm that griffithsin interacts with MERS-CoV spike protein, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Soluble MERS-CoV spike proteins were incubated in presence or absence of griffithsin. The presence of spike proteins complexed with griffithsin was analyzed by Western blot after immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-griffithsin antibody (Fig. 3C). Western blot analysis revealed that spike protein could be coimmunoprecipitated only in presence of griffithsin.",

In this experiment, viral entry steps were divided into attachment at 4 \u00b0C, further binding at 4 \u00b0C, internalization at 37 \u00b0C. In the control conditions, griffithsin was either not present during entry steps (a) or present during all entry steps (e). In the latter condition, griffithsin had a significant inhibitory effect on infectivity compared to control condition (a), a result which recapitulates well the dose-response results (Fig. 4B and C). We do note however that the infectivity in condition (a) (31.7%) is lower than observed in the non-treated control of the dose response experiments (84.3%). We attribute this drop to differences in the infection assays used, such as shorter inoculum contact time and multiple PBS washes. In condition (b), where griffithsin is only present during the first attachment step, a significant decrease in infectivity was measured (Fig. 4C). Such significant inhibition was not observed for conditions (c), and (d), where griffithsin was present only at later steps in entry (further binding without inoculum, and internalization, respectively). Taken together, these data reveal that griffithsin acts on very early stages of virus entry, probably by directly interacting with the glycosylated part of MERS-CoV spike protein and inhibiting its binding function.",

In the case of MERS-CoV, person-to-person transmission has occurred, however transmission is not sustained, with a basic reproduction number below 1. MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, and camels and bats are its most likely reservoir. SARS-CoV-like viruses have been isolated in bats and it is likely that bats are the reservoir of a SARS-CoV ancestor. Considering the increasing number and diversity of coronaviruses identified/isolated in bats and the proven propensity of coronaviruses to cross the species barrier and infect new hosts, it is likely that new coronaviruses causing severe diseases in humans may emerge in the future. Currently, there are no drugs with proven efficacy to treat MERS-CoV or any other coronavirus infection. Treatments are limited to supportive care for respiratory and circulatory functions and preventive care to protect renal, hepatic and neurological functions and to prevent secondary infection. As a consequence, new therapies are urgently needed. Virus features conserved among the coronavirus family are attractive targets for the development of antiviral therapy to fight current and future emerging coronavirus infections.",

By using particles pseudo-typed with the MERS-CoV spike protein, we have shown that griffithsin acts during MERS-CoV entry. Among the 3 viral proteins anchored in the MERS-CoV envelope, in addition to the spike protein, only the M protein harbors a potential N-glycosylation site in its short N-terminal domain. For MHV, it has been shown that the M protein may be an additional target for lectins and enhance its antiviral effects. Griffithsin inhibits MERS-CoV pseudotyped-particles to the same extent than MERS-CoV infection, suggesting that the spike protein is the main target of griffithsin for its antiviral effect. Indeed, our results indicate a direct interaction of griffithsin with MERS-CoV spike protein. For HIV, griffithsin binds to the terminal mannoses of the N-glycans of gp120, this binding slightly interferes with CD4 binding and likely prevents conformational rearrangement required during entry (Mori et al., 2005). For SARS-CoV, it has been shown that griffithsin does not affect ACE2 binding and it has been suggested that griffithsin acts at a post-binding step during entry (O'Keefe et al., 2010). Other plant lectins, Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Hippeasttrum hybrid lectin (HHA) and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) have also been shown to prevent MHV entry at a post-binding step probably by interfering with the conformational rearrangements of the spike protein that drive the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane (van der Meer et al., 2007). For MERS-CoV, our results show that griffithsin inhibits infection with a different mechanism. In fact, we found that griffithsin interferes with infection as early as during the attachment step, likely by preventing interaction between spike and DPP4, but is not able to prevent MERS-CoV infection when added at a post-binding step. Indeed, a similar mechanism of receptor binding interference has already been observed for HCV (Meuleman et al., 2011). Crystal structures of MERS-CoV receptor binding domain (RBD, residues 367 to 606) have been resolved in combination with DPP4 or in its absence. The MERS-CoV RBD contains a core domain with an accessory subdomain lying on the edge of the core structure (Chen et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2013). Both subdomains contain N-linked glycans on N210 in the core domain and on N487 in the accessory domain. The contributions of these sugar moieties to the virus-receptor interaction are unknown, but one can imagine that any involvement of one of these N-glycans in receptor binding could be impaired by griffithsin. In conclusion, griffithsin has a low cytotoxicity, likely interacts with any coronavirus spike proteins because of their highly glycosylated nature and is able to hamper coronavirus spike protein functions. Griffithsin should be considered as an interesting drug candidate to develop for the treatment and/or prevention of current but also future emerging coronavirus infections.",

(A) Huh-7 cells were inoculated with MERSpp in the presence of griffithsin at given concentrations. In parallel, Huh-7 cells were inoculated with HCVpp or VSV-Gpp in the presence of griffithsin at 1 \u03bcg/mL. Intracellular firefly luciferase signal was measured 48 h post infection and normalized to untreated cultures. (B) Griffithsin (0.5 \u03bcg/mL) and Man-9 at the indicated concentrations were pre-incubated for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C before being added to the MERSpp for infection of Huh-7. Intracellular firefly luciferase signal was measured as described above. Experiment was performed three times in duplicate or triplicate. Error bars represent SEM. Data were statistically analyzed using two-tailed Student's t-test comparing results with non-treated condition with the following convention for p-value significance: not significant (n.s.), significant (*) p > 0.05; highly significant (**) p \u2264 0.01, very highly significant (***), p \u2264 0.001. (C) Soluble MERS-CoV spike protein was incubated in presence or absence of 2 \u03bcg/mL griffithsin. Then griffithsin was immunoprecipitated and MERS-CoV spike protein was detected in Western blot.",

            "text": "Fig.\u00a04: Inhibitory activity of griffithsin at early stages of MERS-CoV infection. (A) Schematic of experimental time course. Infection of Huh-7 cells was divided into four steps: the initial viral inoculation (attachment) step was performed at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h in presence (conditions b and e) or absence (PBS in a, c, and d) of 1 \u03bcg/mL griffithsin, using an m.o.i. of 10. During the second step, the viral inoculum was removed and cells were washed three times with cold PBS and kept at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, enabling further binding of virus to cell surfaces, in presence (c and e) or absence (a, b, and d) of 1 \u03bcg/mL griffithsin. For the third step, the cells were placed at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h allowing for internalization of virions to occur, in presence (d and e) or absence (a, b, and c) of 1 \u03bcg/mL griffithsin. The infection was left to proceed in a last 8 h step at 37 \u00b0C in absence griffithsin. (B) Immunofluorescence assay of MERS-CoV-infected Huh-7 cells with griffithsin present at different stages of infection. Cells were infected and treated as described in (A) then fixed, immunolabeled and analyzed as described previously in Fig. 2. (C) Quantification of MERS-CoV-positive Huh-7 cells for each condition tested. Cells were analyzed as described in Fig. 2. Results are expressed as percentage infected cells, with error bars representing SD from the average of three independent experiments. Data were statistically analyzed using two-tailed Student's t-test comparing results with non-treated condition (a) with the following convention for p-value significance: not significant (n.s.), p > 0.05; very highly significant (***), p \u2264 0.001.",
