The results show that using mouth covering by the infected person can reduce the co-occupant's inhalation greatly by interrupting direct spread of the expelled droplets, and best performance can be achieved under DV since the coughed air is mainly confined in the microenvironment of the infected person.

Meanwhile, the effects of mouth covering and desk partition are also studied under MV. There are two people working there, sitting face to face with a roughly 1.5 m distance between their nose-tips. The one on the right is assumed to be the infected person who emits pathogen-laden droplets and the other is called the co-occupant. In front of the infected person, a rectangular slab (0.20 m (length)\u00d7 0.12 m (height)) is set to represent mouth covering and located at about 0.03 m ahead of the mouth. There are desk partitions in the middle of the two people to build a private environment for each and the upper level of the partitions is 1.5 m above the floor. Boundary conditions for the computer, desk, window, human body, and walls are listed in Table 1 . Three ventilation methods, including MV, UFAD and DV, are investigated. The temperature of inlet airflow is set to be 16 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C, respectively, with the same air change rate of 6.4 times per hour. The swirling diffuser under UFAD is simulated by eight small square cells [13] Although a normal respiration process follows a sinusoidal cycle, steady inhalation for the co-occupant is assumed in this simulation. The breathing rate for the steady respiratory process is 8.4 L/min through nostrils, and the direction of inhaled jet is 45\u00b0 upward. As to the infected person, a horizontal pulsating jet from the mouth at a velocity of 22 m/s [14] lasting 0.5 s, is assumed to simulate several consecutive coughs.

The pathogen-laden droplets from the infected person could reach the co-occupant directly when there is no covering, while the coughed air will be redirect to the region behind the infected person by using mouth covering. Fig. 2 clearly shows that mouth covering can reduce the co-occupant's inhalation by avoiding the direct exposure. The normalized inhaled concentration of the co-occupant under three ventilation systems is shown in Fig. 3 when the infected person coughs directly and in Fig. 4 when coughs with mouth covering. Since the coughed air can approach the co-occupant immediately when there is no blocking, the exposed contaminant concentration is quite higher. Due to the mainly upward air movement under DV which hampers the horizontal transportation of the coughing air, the inhaled concentration reaches its peak at the first stage about 1 s later compared with MV and UFAD. With the time elapsing, this higher momentum coughing jet dissipates, and ventilation system distributes the dispersed droplet residuals gradually, leading to the decreasing inhaled concentrations. In the situations with mouth covering, the expelled air is thwarted and cannot reach the co-occupant directly, as shown in Fig. 2 .
