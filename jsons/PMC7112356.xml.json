            "text": "Mathematical models are increasingly used to guide public health policy decisions and to control infectious disease. Epidemic dynamics is an important method of studying the spread of infectious disease qualitatively and quantitatively. The research results are helpful to predict the developing tendency of the infectious disease, to determine the key factors of the spread of infectious disease and to seek the optimum strategies of preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. Mathematical models have a long history in infectious disease ecology starting with Bernoulli\u2019s [1] modelling of smallpox and including Ross\u2019s [2] analysis of malaria. The earliest attempt to provide a quantitative understanding of the dynamics of malaria transmission was that of Ross [2]. Ross models consisted of a few differential equations to describe changes in densities of susceptible and infected people, and susceptible and infected mosquitoes. Based on his modelling, Ross introduced the concept of a threshold density and concluded that \u2018in order to counteract malaria anywhere we need not vanish Anopheles there entirely we need only to reduce their numbers below a certain figure [3]. Classical papers of mathematical modelling of infectious disease was constructed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927 [4], 1932 [5], and 1933 [6]). These papers had a major influence on the development of mathematical models for disease spread and are still relevant in many epidemic situations. Aim of ecological modelling is to understand the prevalence and distribution of a species, together with the factors that determine incidence, spread, and persistence (Anderson and May [7]; May and Anderson [8]; Bascompte and Rodriguez-Trelles [9]). Now we have models for many of the most important human emerging infectious diseases e.g., HIV (May and Anderson [10]), malaria (Aron and May [11]; Macdonald [12]), SARS-coronavirus (Anderson et al. [13]), rabies (Murray and Seward [14]), and influenza (Ferguson and Anderson [15]). Mathematical models are also being used to explore wildlife disease dynamics (Grenfell and Dobson [16]; Hudson et al. [17]) and possible routes of zoonotic disease emergence. Understanding disease dynamics across hosts is an essential first step in understanding and articulating those conditions under which new diseases can emerge from wildlife reservoirs [18]. A predator\u2013prey system with infected prey in polluted environment is proposed by Sinha et al. [19]. Anderson and May [20] were probably the first who considered the disease factor in a predator\u2013prey dynamics and found that the pathogen tends to destabilize the predator\u2013prey interaction. In Rosenzweig prey-predator model, Hadeler and Freedman [21] determined a threshold above which an infected equilibrium or an infected periodic solution appear. Chattopadhyay and Arino [22] considered a three species ecoepidemiological model and studied local stability of equilibrium points, extinction criteria of species and found condition for Hopf-bifurcation in an equivalent two-dimensional model. Haque and Chattopadhyay [23] studied the role of transmissible diseases in a prey dependent predator\u2013prey system with prey infection. Haque and Venturino reported the influence of transmissible disease in prey taking Holling\u2013Tanner predator\u2013prey model [24]. The dynamical behaviour of the predator\u2013prey system was investigated when a predator avoids infected prey and the predator has alternative sources of food ([25], [26]). Bhattacharyya et al. [27] proposed a epidemiological model with nonlinear infection incidence. Das et al. [28] modified the HP model by introducing disease in the prey population. They derived conditions for population extinction and the conditions for permanent or impermanent of the system. Sahoo and Poria described a diseased prey-predator model supplying additional food to predator for biological control[29]. Recently, Haque et al. investigated predator-infected eco-epidemics systems with different functional responses[30].",

Section 6 presents the conditions for global stability. Section 7 contains the numerical simulation results of the model. We have done bifurcation analysis of the model with respect to general Holling parameters and have also investigated the influence of infection rate on the dynamics.

            "text": "All food chain models use some realistic interaction functions between preys and predators based on some biological hypothesis. A realistic interaction function should not allow the predators to grow arbitrarily fast, if prey is abundant. Apart from these basic biological considerations, Holling interaction functions are taken as simplest realistic interactions. Holling type-II function is defined as F(X)=AXK+X, where A is the maximum predation rate and K is half saturation constant. The function increase linearly if X is small. At large values of X the slope of the function F\u2032(X) decreases as predator becomes saturated but F\u2032(X) always remains non-negative. Actually, the Holling type-II function is based on the assumption that predation rate is proportional to prey density if prey is scarce. However, if the predator actively seeks out large concentration of prey the Holling type-III function F(X)=AX2K2+X2 is more appropriate. Since the slope of this function goes to zero for small values of X it may be suspected that the food chain will be destabilized if prey concentration becomes too small. The general Holling function is defined as F(X)=AX\u03b1K\u03b1+X\u03b1, where \u03b1>0 ([34], [35], [36]). The behaviour of different types response functions are shown in Fig. 1\nfor different values of \u03b1.",

This different combinations of functional forms are taken because the capturing of infected prey is different from that of susceptible prey. Top-predator preys intermediate predator in the form of general Holling type interaction. This is in contrast to other models which assume particular Holling type interactions ([24], [25], [26]).(e)The infected prey population dies at the rate D1 and the intermediate predator and top-predator die at the rate D2 and D3 respectively.\n",

Note that \u03a9(\u03c7) is bounded.We claim that E0\u2209\u03a9(\u03c7). If E0\u2208\u03a9(\u03c7) then by the Butler\u2013McGehee lemma there exist a point P in \u03a9\u22c2Ws(E0) where Ws(E0) denotes the stable manifold of E0. Since O(p) lies in \u03a9(\u03c7) and Ws(E0) is the i-p1-p2 space, we conclude that o(P) is unbounded, which is a contradiction.Next E1\u2209\u03a9(\u03c7), for otherwise, since E1 is a saddle point (which follows from the existence of E2 and E3) by the Butler\u2013McGehee lemma there exist a point P in \u03a9\u22c2Ws(E1) . Now Ws(E1) is the s-p2 plane implies that an unbounded orbit lies in \u03a9(\u03c7), a contradiction.Next we show that E3\u2209\u03a9(\u03c7). If E3\u2208\u03a9(\u03c7), the condition fe\u03b1a\u03b1+ce\u03b1+g(a-e)a2>j implies that E3 is saddle point. Ws(E3) is the s-i-p2 space and hence the orbits in this space emanate either E0 or E1 or an unbounded lies in \u03a9(\u03c7), again a contradiction.The condition as\u00af>dp1\u00af+e implies that E4 is a unstable point and also the contradiction, kp1\u02c6\u03b2(1+mp1\u02c6\u03b2)>l implies that E5 is unstable. So by similar arguments we can show that E4\u2209\u03a9(\u03c7) and E5\u2209\u03a9(\u03c7).Lastly we show that no periodic orbits in the s-p1 or E2\u2208\u03a9(\u03c7). Let ri,i=1,2,\u2026..,n denote the closed orbit of the periodic solution (\u03d5r(t),\u03c8r(t)) in s-p1 plane such that ri lies inside r(i-1). Let the Jacobian matrix J given in (6) corresponding to ri is denoted by Jr(\u03d5r(t),0,\u03c8r(t),0). \u25a1\n",

Thus a community is impermanent if there is at least one semi orbit which tends to boundary. \u25a1\nTheorem 7\nLet\nf>(c+1)j\nand\na>e\nand if the condition\nfe\u03b1a\u03b1+ce\u03b1+g(a-e)a2<j\nholds, then the system\n(2)\nis impermanent.\n\nProofThe conditions f>(c+1)j and a>e are obtain from existence of the equilibria points E2 and E3. The given condition\nfe\u03b1a\u03b1+ce\u03b1+g(a-e)a2<j implies that E3 is a saturated equilibrium point on boundary. Hence, there exist at least one orbit in the interior that converges to the boundary (Hofbauer, [42]).Consequently the system (2) is impermanent (Hutson and Law, [41]). \u25a1\n",

In this package we use prediction\u2013correction continuation algorithm based on the Moore\u2013Penrose matrix pseudo inverse for computing the curves of equilibria, limit point (LP), along with fold bifurcation points of limit point (LP) and continuation of Hopf point (H), etc.",

To start with we show in Fig. 7(b) the continuation curve from the Hopf (H) point with respect to \u03b2. We observe six generalized Hopf (GH) points, one Bogdanov\u2013Takens (BT) point, one zero-Hopf (ZH) point, two Neutral saddle (HH) point at different values of \u03b1 and \u03b2. At the generalized Hopf (GH) points, where the first Lyapunov coefficient vanishes indicating that all GH points are non-degenerate, since the second Lyapunov coefficients are non-zero. The Bogdanov\u2013Taken points are common points for the limit point curves and curves corresponding to equilibria with eigenvalues \u03bb1+\u03bb2=0,\u03bb3\u22600. Actually, at each BT point, the Hopf bifurcation curve (with \u03bb1,2=\u00b1i\u03c9,\u03c9>0) turn into the neutral saddle curve (with real \u03bb1=-\u03bb2). Now, we start LP point continuation from a Bogdanov\u2013Taken (BT) point. If we choose \u03b2 and \u03b1 as free parameters and start from the BT point, the continuation curve shows two BT points and two cusp points (CP) which is shown in Fig. 8\n(a). A similar analysis can also be carried out for the variables i,p1 and p2, the results being displayed in Fig. 8(b), Fig. 9\n(a) and Fig. 9(b) respectively.",

This phenomenon is shown in Fig. 10(a), where again the Holling parameter \u03b2 in the system is the only free parameter. One observes that at \u03b2=1.025252, we have a LPC point with period 83.36766. At this situation two cycles collide and disappears. The critical cycle has a double multiplier equal to 1. From this it follows that a stable branch occurs after the LPC point. For \u03b2=1.028799, another LPC point occurs with one of the multiplier is greater than 1 which indicates that the cycle is unstable after LPC point. At \u03b2=1.023759 there is a period doubling (PD) with period 92.32825, two of the multiplier is equal to 1. However, for \u03b2=1.003603, we observe PD again with period 102.9418, one of the multiplier is greater than 1. At \u03b2=1.002767 and \u03b2=1.013483, LPC\u2019s are observed with period 105.6208 and 113.8772 respectively. For \u03b2=0.9888908, we have a branch point cycle (BPC) with period 133.5280. If we choose \u03b2 and period of the cycles as free parameters and start from the Hopf point (H), as shown in Fig. 7(a), then the corresponding variation of period versus \u03b2 is shown in Fig. 10\n(b). The similar analysis is done starting from the second Hopf point (H) as initial point, as shown in Fig. 7(a) at \u03b2=1.540269, and we observe family of stable LPC in Fig. 11\n(a).

We derive sufficient conditions for local stability of equilibrium points. We also analyse the permanence and impertinence conditions of the system. The conditions for global stability are also obtained for different Holling parameters. We have explored the detailed bifurcation scenario of the proposed system varying the interaction function parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2. The interesting outcomes are the occurrence of various kinds of bifurcation points in the process of continuation. Altogether our analysis reveals the internal complexity of the system in detailed manner. Bifurcation analysis shows that the dynamics of susceptible prey, infected prey, intermediate predator and top-predator are highly effected by the force of infection a as well as the interaction parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, which is in sharp contrast with the existing results [24], [25], [26]. From the simulation results, it is clear that the infected prey extinct for proper choice of interaction functions. Therefore, a diseased system reduces to a disease free system with proper choice of general Holling parameters. Therefore, we can succesfully control a disease by controlling interaction function from outside in ecosystem. We observe various types of non-unique bifurcation diagrams with respect to bifurcation parameters \u03b1,\u03b2 and a respectively, having stable fixed point, limit cycle, period-2 to higher periodic oscillations, chaotic bands etc. We notice that the infected prey may survive in the system for some range of values of general Holling parameters.",

Our observations indicate that chaos disappear for suitable choice of interaction functions. The most important observation is that our model with Holling type-II interaction (for \u03b1=1,\u03b2=1) shows chaotic behaviour but for \u03b1\u2208[1.16,1.56],\u03b2=0.98 it shows periodic behaviour. The periodic dynamical behaviour of species was reported by many researchers from the field data [44] and laboratory data [45]. Therefore, the model with Holling type-II interactions does not always realistic in ecology, because there are lots of real food chain model which are not chaotic, but depicts oscillatory coexistence. Therefore, we conclude that a realistic food chain model depends on proper choice of general Holling parameters. Novelty of our observation is that one can control an infectious disease if the interaction functions can be controlled from outside. As research extends to higher level, we must need to continue the study for construction of real food chain model with proper general Holling interactions.",
