Typically these processes are transmission, disease progression, birth, death and recovery, acquisition and loss of immunity, and immigration or emigration. Other processes appropriate for certain applications include boosting of immunity, vector dynamics, vaccination, and other control measures. By using these models we hope to capture important aspects of the behavior of the whole system and gain a full understanding of the role of the individual processes and their interactions in determining this behavior. The properties of these models and their predicted behavior under different scenarios are usually investigated either by solving the equations (in the case of deterministic models, where chance is assumed to play no part, and which can often be considered to model the average behavior of the system), or by simulating many epidemics from stochastic models (an approach known as Monte Carlo simulation because the role of chance in determining the course of O.

This in silico modeling approach is directly comparable with the use of in vitro or in vivo models in the laboratory; all three approaches work by choosing model systems that are, it is hoped, in some important sense analogous to the system we really want to find out about. We may hope that the model is sufficiently similar to the real system in the ways that matter to give the same answers to the questions we ask, but we can seldom be sure. A cautious and critical approach to interpreting results from all models is therefore needed. Mathematical models are no exception to this rule.

The translation process has the virtue of forcing (or at least encouraging) us to think clearly, and tends to makes hidden assumptions explicit. Flaws in the reasoning of simple verbal arguments often become apparent once the models have been constructed. Models also allow the intuition that the verbal arguments rest on to be thoroughly tested. In this sense, models can be thought as formal encapsulations of hypotheses. Sometimes the resulting models support the verbal arguments and we may be encouraged that our intuition was correct, but frequently models show that our loose verbal reasoning is wrong. These models produce counterintuitive results. However, even when model results confirm our intuition, by allowing a fuller and more rigorous analysis of the consequences of the assumptions that make up the model they can broaden our understanding of the system. Often models will make new predictions that can be directly tested. If they pass the test, our confidence in the truth of the hypothesized mechanism the model represents will be strengthened. There is also a danger that new hidden assumptions are made in constructing the model. Careful modeling work should aim to highlight these assumptions and ideally to explore the sensitivity of the results to structural uncertainties in the model as well as to uncertainty in parameter values.",

            "text": "There are at least four reasons why we might want to use mathematical models to study CCHF. First and foremost, they can help us to gain a qualitative understanding of the dynamics of the disease and, in this way, help us to improve our intuition. This is likely to be particularly important for studying nosocomial outbreaks where stochastic (chance) effects will be important. As casino owners know well, most people have rather poor intuition about chance, and the importance of such effects in epidemics in small populations comes as a surprise to many. Second, by highlighting key uncertainties and gaps in our knowledge models may suggest observational or experimental studies that would improve our understanding of key aspects of the whole system. This is likely to be particular important in the area of understanding the vector dynamics where major uncertainties exist for CCHF. Since models can also be considered to be hypotheses about the systems, by confronting models with data we can effectively choose between competing hypotheses. Third, models can help in the selection and evaluation of control policies. This can be done by employing models as statistical tools used to estimate the effect of interventions that have been made (and, equally importantly, to quantify the uncertainty in these estimates). Having quantified the effect of individual interventions, we can then go on to use models to ask \"what-if \" questions, using models predictively to determine the expected effect of hypothetical combinations of interventions. More generally, by enabling us to identify the most critical parameters affecting the behavior of the system, models can help us in setting priorities and identifying the most cost-effective control policies. Indeed, the use of dynamic models is essential for accurate economic analyses of control measures for infectious diseases [3] . Fourth, there is the potential to use models for forecasting the future of epidemics. Though popularly imagined as one of the main uses of models (perhaps by analogy to the models used to derive weather forecasts) this is one of the least developed areas in the infectious disease modeling literature, although there is increasing interest in this application.",

            "text": "In this section we describe a basic framework for modeling tick-borne infections. This is adapted from the seminal work on the transmission dynamics of tickborne infections by Medley et al. [12] . We show how this approach enables us to assess the magnitude of interventions needed to control CCHF in different regions and how interventions aimed at controlling the tick population could increase as well as decrease the risk to workers exposed to potentially infected animals. We also describe how this basic framework can be extended to address a wider class of questions. The model presented by Medley et al. related specifically to the tick-borne transmission of Theileria parva in eastern Africa. The modeling framework described was, however, quite general, and with only minor modifications we can apply it to the study of CCHF. We begin by showing how seroprevalence data can be used to estimate the rate at which animals become infected with the CCHF virus. We assume that the rate at which an animal of age a is infected with the virus is b(a) (mathematically this means that the chance an uninfected animal of age a is infected in a short time interval dt is approximately b(a)dt, the approximation becoming exact in the limit as dt approaches zero. The (a) following the b indicates that this rate is a function of age, and not necessarily constant). From this we can immediately write down a differential equation describing how the number of susceptible animals (those which have never been infected) changes with the age of the animals:",

Substituting these into Equation (2) and solving gives X(a i ) = exp(\u2212ba i ) and X(a i ) = exp(\u2212ca i \u2212 b 2 a i / 2), respectively. Equivalently these models predict that the numbers seropositive by a given age, which we call S(a), are given by S(a) = 1\u2212 exp(\u2212ba) and S(a) = 1\u2212 exp(\u2212ca \u2212ba 2 /2), respectively. Many other functional forms for b(a) are possible (e.g. the infection rate might saturate with increasing age), but these two are the simplest and have found to be adequate for explaining many age-seroprevalence profiles. Using these expressions for S(a) we can estimate the infection rate by fitting the curves to age-seroprevalence profiles. Such profiles could be obtained by a longitudinal study, repeatedly sampling from the same animals over time, or -providing it was reasonable to assume the system was in equilibrium -by using data from a cross-sectional, age-stratified survey of animals. Figure 15 -1 below illustrates how the seroprevalence would be expected to change with age for both functional forms of b(a). It also shows simulated data from a hypothetical cross-sectional study. In practice b(a) would be estimated from such data by fitting curves for S(a) corresponding to different functional forms of b(a) to the data. This can be done using standard maximum likelihood methods assuming binomially distributed data, allowing model parameters and their confidence intervals to be estimated. The best-fitting functional form of b(a) can be selected with a likelihood ratio test. The rate of infection, b(a), is equal to the product of the rate of tick attachment as a function of age, T(a), the probability of a tick being infected with the virus in an endemically stable environment, r*, and the probability of transfer of infection from an infected tick to a host it is attached to, q. Rearranging this gives T(a) = b(a)/(qr*), so once estimates of b(a) have been obtained using the method described above, if we also have estimates of q and r* (which should be relatively easy to obtain), it becomes possible to derive estimates of the tick attachment rate as a function of host age.",

However, when the system is in equilibrium (i.e. when the size of the host population and the amount of infection in that population is neither increasing nor decreasing with time, apart from small chance fluctuations) the proportion of ticks infected will not change over time and b(a) will also not change over time.

Essentially, these equations describe the flows between the compartments in Fig. 15 -2: hosts leave the S compartment at rate b(a)S(a) due to infection, and at rate mS(a) due to death. Those becoming infected first flow into the E compartment at the same rate they leave the S compartment. They can leave the E compartment due to death (at rate mE(a)) or by progressing from the latently infected stage to the infectious stage (at rate qE(a)). Other terms in the above equations can be explained in a similar manner. Typical output for such a model when b(a) is taken as a constant b is illustrated in Fig. 15 -3. This shows the proportion of animals that are expected to be susceptible, latently infected, infectious, and immune under representative parameter values. It is noteworthy that with the relatively short infectious period assumed here (10 days), only a very small proportion of animals in most age groups are infected. This is despite the fact that infection rate, b, is high enough in this scenario to ensure that almost all animals surviving for a year or more will have been infected. Thus, despite the fact that the infection is highly endemic and would be hard to eradicate, the very low prevalence in all but the youngest age groups implies that the risk to workers handling potentially infected animals will be small provided that contacts are with animals more than about 150 days old. In general, the age profile of infectiousness will depend on all the model parameters (those used here are entirely arbitrary). Knowledge of the pattern of infection with age in different settings, however, could inform risk assessments and control policies aimed at minimizing exposures to infected animals. A corollary of this observation is that control policies that aim to reduce the total tick population and hence the infection rate b(a) (taken to be a constant, b, here) could, under some circumstances, increase the risk to humans. Such a perverse outcome could arise if people in high-risk occupations (veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, etc.) were preferentially exposed to animals above the age at which most animals became infected in the absence of interventions. If the infection rate, b, was initially high, even large reductions in the tick population could have little effect on the total number of animals escaping infection, but could dramatically affect the ages at which animals became infected ( Fig.  15-4) . Progressive reductions in b have the effect of substantially increasing the likelihood that older animals are infected. Thus, for the highest value of b in this scenario, there are almost no infected animals which are older than 200 days. As b is reduced there becomes an appreciable chance that animals in these age groups will be infectious, putting those who have contact with them at risk. Such risks should be considered when evaluating the likely benefits of any control measure that aims to reduce infection but that is unlikely to lead to overall control of the disease.",

If we are interested in studying the temporal evolution of a system that is changing over time (perhaps due to the implementation of a control measure) we need to modify the approach. Most importantly, we expect the probability that a tick is infected, r, to change with the number of animal hosts infected. A simple and biologically plausible assumption is that r will increase linearly with the prevalence of infected hosts. This can be represented mathematically as r(t) = cY(t)/N where c represents the probability that infection passes from an infectious hosts to an uninfected tick and N is the total number of hosts. The infection rate can then be expressed as a function of time (rather than age) as b(t) = qTr(tj), where j is the time a newly infected tick takes to develop and become infectious. If we replace b(a) in Equations (3) above with this expression for b(t), add a term mN to right-hand side of the Equation (1) to represent births (assumed to balance deaths from all compartments), and replacing a with t, we will have a model suitable for studying the nonequilibrium situation.",

It is useful to distinguish between two reproduction numbers: the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and the effective reproduction number (R t ). R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case in an otherwise fully susceptible population in the absence of control measures. R t is defined similarly, except that the population is not required to be fully susceptible and there may be control measures in place. In the absence of control measures R t can be calculated as the product of R 0 and the proportion of the population that is susceptible.

When R 0 is less than 1 there may still be chains of disease transmission, and occasionally these may even be quite long, but these will be self-limiting and have no chances of leading to the self-sustaining chain reaction of a full-blown epidemic that affects thousands. R t is important since it determines the rate of epidemic growth at a given point in time. During the course of an epidemic R t will decline from its initial value of R 0 as the number of susceptibles decreases. It may also decline as result of interventions designed to control the disease. When R t is equal to 1 the epidemic is neither growing nor falling. If there is no supply of new susceptibles, R t will proceed to fall below 1 as the pool of susceptibles decreases further. If there is a sufficient supply of new susceptibles (through birth, loss of immunity, or immigration) it is possible to reach an endemic equilibrium state where the generation of new susceptibles matches the loss of susceptibles due to infection. In this case R t is maintained at a value of 1, and the amount of infection neither increases nor decreases over time. Cyclic behavior can occur when the epidemic causes R t to fall well below 1, and a longer-term increase in susceptibles due to births eventually restores R t to a value above 1 permitting another epidemic. This is the cause of the cyclic pattern of childhood diseases such as measles [8] .",

An alternative formulation expresses R 0 in terms of the equilibrium infection rate b*: R 0 = 1 + b*/m. This holds only when b* is greater than zero and, therefore, when R 0 is greater than 1.

In particular, when modeling interventions that are likely to affect the tick population, models that describe details of the tick life cycle (and how these are affected by the intervention) will usually be required. One interesting recent example of this is due to Ogden et al.

When the populations under investigation are large, this is a reasonable approach: the time evolution of the system is likely to be quite predictable and individual chance events (e.g. whether or not one animal gets infected, how long it takes another to recover) are unimportant. Just as casinos may lose on individual bets but are sure to win in the long run, in a large population when many are infectious there are so many individual unpredictable events that the eventual outcome becomes highly predictable. In small populations, such as hospital units, and at the beginning of epidemics in both large and small populations when only small numbers are infected, this deterministic approach fails badly. The details of the random events that make up an epidemic become important. For example, if the first infected person happens to die before he has a chance to infect anyone an epidemic will not occur, even if it had the potential to (i.e. even if R 0 was greater than 1).

These show results from Monte Carlo simulations from a stochastic susceptibleexposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model which has a structure similar to that shown in Fig. 15 -2 (except that births and nondisease-related deaths can be ignored because we are interested in short timescales over which it is reasonable to assume a fixed population size). This simple model could be considered to provide an approximate description of transmission in a small population such as a hospital unit that has stopped admitted new patients (when new patients continue to be admitted the constant supply of susceptibles leads to rather different dynamics [5] ). The model assumes that each day each infectious person has some fixed chance of infecting each susceptible person and some fixed probability, g, of ceasing to be infectious. When infected, individuals enter a latent compartment, with 198 Cooper Fig. 15 -5. Incident cases (solid lines) and number of susceptibles (broken lines) from stochastic simulations of an SEIR epidemic model when there is no intervention (row A), an intervention to reduce the probability of transmission from each case by 50% after 20 days (row B), and an intervention to reduce this probability by 90% (row C). Columns (left to right) show results for initial R 0 values of 1.1, 2, and 5. Three runs from each scenario are shown, except when R 0 is 1.1, when 10 runs are shown (since in this case in most simulations the epidemic does not take off). A mean incubation period of 5 days is assumed (daily probability of progressing from latent to infectious is 0.2) and a mean infectious period of 3.3 days (daily probability of ceasing to be infectious is 0.3), and at day 0 there are 200 susceptibles and one latent case. a daily probability, q, of progressing to the infectious compartment. The basic reproduction number, R 0 , in this model is equal to the mean infectious period (1/g) multiplied by the probability that a given susceptible person is infected by one infectious case on a given day, multiplied by the initial number of susceptibles. Figure 15 -5 (top row) indicates typical model outcomes in a population of 200 initially susceptible people when no intervention to control the epidemic is made. When R 0 is greater than 1 there is a chance of an epidemic. This chance increases with R 0 (Fig. 15-6) . In contrast to the deterministic model, there is also a real chance that that the epidemic dies out almost immediately. This can be seen in Fig. 15 -5, where even though R 0 is greater than 1 in some of the simulation runs the epidemic fails to take off and the susceptible population stays near to its initial value of 200. Figure 15-6 shows that even when R 0 = 2, there is no secondary transmission at all in about one third of the simulations. As R 0 increases above 1 there is an increasing chance that if there is any secondary transmission a large number of infections will result. This gives rise to bimodal distribution when R 0 is above 1 (Fig. 15-6 ). It is also noticeable that as R 0 increases, when the epidemic does take off it tends to peak earlier and affects more people, though the precise course of the epidemic is not predictable (Fig. 15-5 ).",

This is shown in rows B and C of Fig. 15-5 . When transmission probability is reduced by 50% after 20 days (row B) R t is reduced to approximately half the initial R 0 value. In the first column this is sufficient to control the epidemic (because R t \u22480.55 at day 20), and though some transmission persists the epidemic comes to an end soon. When R 0 is 2 a 50% reduction in transmission gives an R t \u22481 at day 20, which is enough to permit prolonged transmission at a low level, but not to allow a large epidemic. In contrast, when R 0 is 5 a 50% transmission reduction brings R t down to about 2.5. This is not enough to control the epidemic and most of the susceptibles go on to be infected (though fewer than would have been without the intervention). In contrast, the 90% reduction in transmission in row C is sufficient to reduce R t below 1 in all cases, and in all simulations runs the epidemics are quickly brought under control. Nevertheless, the large number of infected cases by day 20 when R 0 is 5 is sufficient to ensure continued transmission for some time after the intervention.

Effect of delays in making an intervention that reduces transmission by 90%, assuming R 0 = 2. Twenty simulations were performed for each delay (measured in days since the first infectious case). Where two or more simulation runs have given the same result, the number of \"petals\" on each point of the sunflower plot indicates the number of simulation runs represented. scenario if an intervention able to reduce the probability of transmission by 90% is made as soon as the first case is detected there is a high probability that there almost all secondary spread can be eliminated. Delays of 5 days or more lead to significant chances that much larger numbers will be affected, though there remains a substantial chance that the epidemic will die out of its own accord and affect few people. This accounts for the bimodal distribution in the number of cases that starts to become apparent when interventions are delayed by 20 days or more.",

This can be done by constructing models that allow people to move with some probability straight from the exposed to the recovered compartment. It is also relatively easy to further modify this basic model structure to better capture observed distributions of the latent and infectious periods and to account for variable infectivity with time since infection.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic also highlighted the high degree of variability in the number of secondary cases produced by each primary case [10] .

The best of these uses computationally intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to estimate the basic reproduction number and other model parameters and quantify the uncertainty in these estimates. Such an approach has recently been used to estimate the basic reproduction number for Ebola and to evaluate the role of interventions in reducing transmission [9] . This method could be adapted relatively easily to study CCHF transmission, and detailed data from outbreaks used to evaluate the evidence of effectiveness for different interventions. Much simpler approaches based on deterministic approximations are also possible [4] , but these methods appear not to accurately characterize the uncertainty and may therefore be inappropriate for assessing the evidence of effectiveness of different interventions [9] .",
