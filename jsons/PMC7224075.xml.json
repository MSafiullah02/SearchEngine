During follow-up out of the 15 patients, eight patients had bilateral femoral head necrosis and seven patients had unilateral femoral head necrosis. Out of the seven patients with unilateral femoral head necrosis, five patients with stabilised Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) stage were noted (three in stage IIA, one in stage IIB and one in stage IIIC), one patient downgraded from stage IIB to stage IIA and another patient upgraded from stage IIC in 2003 to stage IIIC in 2006 and further progressed to stage IV in 2018. Out of the eight patients with bilateral femoral head necrosis, five patients with stabilised ACRO stage were noted (three in stage IIB and two in stage IIC). Out of the remaining three patients with bilateral femoral head necrosis, one patient had stabilised ACRO stage IIB in right limb and upgraded from stage IIC to stage IIIC in left limb in 2006, one patient upgraded from stage IIIC to stage IV in both limbs and one patient upgraded from stage IIC in 2003 to stage IIIC in 2006 and further progressed to stage IV in 2012 in both limbs.",
