More than 36 000 people have died from covid-19 infection (up to 30 March 2020).1 Despite public health responses aimed at containing the disease and delaying the spread, several countries have been confronted with a critical care crisis, and more countries will almost certainly follow.2\n3\n4 Outbreaks lead to important increases in the demand for hospital beds and shortage of medical equipment, while medical staff themselves could also get infected.",

Prediction models that combine several variables or features to estimate the risk of people being infected or experiencing a poor outcome from the infection could assist medical staff in triaging patients when allocating limited healthcare resources. Models ranging from rule based scoring systems to advanced machine learning models (deep learning) have been proposed and published in response to a call to share relevant covid-19 research findings rapidly and openly to inform the public health response and help save lives.5 Many of these prediction models are published in open access repositories, ahead of peer review.",

The duration of follow-up was unclear in most studies, although one reported a median follow-up of 8.4 days,19 while another reported a median follow-up of 15 days.37 Some Chinese centres provided data to multiple studies, but it was unclear how much these datasets overlapped across our 25 identified studies. One study used US Medicare claims data from 2015 to 2016 to estimate vulnerability to covid-19,8 two studies used control CT (computed tomography) scans from the US or Switzerland,11\n25 and one study used simulated data.18All but one study24 developed prediction models for use in adults.

Among the 18 diagnostic model studies, only one reported on prevalence of covid-19 infection in people with suspected covid-19; the prevalence was 19% (development dataset) and 24% (validation dataset).30 One study reported that 8% of patients had severe disease among confirmed paediatric patients with covid-19 infection.24 Because 16 diagnostic studies used either case-control sampling or an unclear method of data collection, the prevalence in these diagnostic studies might not have been representative of their target population.",

This target population must also be carefully described so that the performance of the developed or validated model can be appraised in context, and users know which people the model applies to when making predictions. However, the included studies in our systematic review often lacked an adequate description of the study population, which leaves users of these models in doubt about the models\u2019 applicability. Although we recognise that all studies were done under severe time constraints caused by urgency, we recommend that any studies currently in preprint and all future studies should adhere to the TRIPOD reporting guideline15 to improve the description of their study population and their modelling choices.

Predictors that were included in both diagnostic and prognostic models were albumin (or albumin/globin), direct bilirubin, and red blood cell distribution width; these predictors could be considered as well. By pointing to the most important methodological challenges and issues in design and reporting of the currently available models, we hope to have provided a useful starting point for further studies aiming to develop new models, or to validate and update existing ones.",
