            "text": "Soon after decoding of the huIFN-\u03b1 and huIFN-\u03b2 sequences, molecular modeling of the secondary and three-dimensional structures was performed (18). On the basis of the sequences, it was predicted that huIFN-\u03b1 and huIFN-\u03b2 would contain 60%\u201370% \u03b1-helices. With the stereochemical method of packing the \u03b1-helices into globular proteins, 5 segments of \u03b1-helices, capable of forming tightly packed hydrophobic cores, were localized (18). Thus, the predicted globular structure of huIFN-\u03b1 and huIFN-\u03b2 was a 5-helix (named the A\u2013E) bundle (19). Although the overall identity between the sequences of huIFN-\u03b1 and huIFN-\u03b2 was only 29%, the sequences of the AB loop were 46% identitical. Most of the conserved amino acid residues in the AB loop were hydrophilic and, therefore, exposed to the surface. There was also 70% identity in the region of \u03b1-helix E, and therefore it was suggested that the AB loop and the \u03b1-helix E together could form the active site (18). Later, the sequences of 28 IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 genes of different species were compared (19). Twenty-one conservative positions were identified in which there was no amino acid substitution or only 1 homologous replacement. A cluster of 7 conservative positions was found in the AB loop. Five of the 7 conservative positions composing this cluster, were hydrophilic and, therefore, very likely to reside on the surface of the molecule. The second cluster of 6 conservative positions was found in the \u03b1-helix E and in the DE loop (19). With the same predictive approach as for the huIFN-\u03b1 and huIFN-\u03b2 (18), it was found that many cytokines (IL2, IL3, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7; macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and chicken myelomonocytic growth factor) were related to \u03b1-helical proteins and contained 54% to 73% of \u03b1-helices (20). Helical segments (in main 5 segments) capable of forming tightly packed hydrophobic cores were localized (20). Hence, IFNs are in fact closely related to the family of \u03b1-helical cytokines (21).",

They exhibit approximately 20%\u201360% sequence identity, and despite their differential activities, all type I IFNs initiate intracellular signaling by binding to a common receptor composed of 2 subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (22). The IFNAR1 subunit has low affinity to huIFN-\u03b12. Therefore, to get a high affinity for IFNAR1, a triple mutant (H57Y, G58N, Q61S) of huIFN-\u03b12 was designed. It was designated as huIFN-\u03b12 (YNS). The stable crystal structures of type I IFN ternary signaling complexes containing both receptor chains IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 in complex with huIFN-\u03b12 (YNS) were solved (23). The crystallographic analysis confirmed the structure of huIFN-\u03b1 to be a 5-helix bundle (23, 24). The major \u03b1-helices, composing a bundle with 5 \u03b1-helices, are labeled A\u2013E, as shown in Fig. 1. The arrows indicate the direction of the corresponding \u03b1-helices from the N- to C-terminus.",

            "text": "IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 bind to opposing surfaces of the huIFN-\u03b12 molecule (Figs. 1 and 2A) (23). A high-affinity binding site for IFNAR2 in the huIFN-\u03b12 molecule is mostly composed of the AB loop and the \u03b1-helix E (Fig. 1, A and C). Arg33 in the huIFN-\u03b12 (YNS), corresponding to Arg35 in the huIFN-\u03c9, is the most important residue for the binding of huIFN-\u03b12 or huIFN-\u03c9 to IFNAR2 (23). The ligand forms a network of hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Ile45 and Glu50 of IFNAR2 and the side chain of Thr44 of IFNAR2. Replacing Arg33 by Ala in the huIFN-\u03b12 (YNS) destabilizes the binding more than any other mutation in the huIFN-\u03b12 (23). Previous attention was drawn to Leu30 in the huIFN-\u03b12 (the equivalent of Leu32 in the huIFN-\u03c9), which is conserved in all type I IFNs (19, 21). In a crystal structure of the ternary complex, both amino acids bind to similar hydrophobic clusters in IFNAR2 (23). Therefore, it was suggested that these residues are energetically critical for the shared anchor points mediating the IFN cross-reactivity. The \u03b1-helix E comprises Val142, Met148, Arg149, Ser152, Leu153, and Asn156, with side chains participating in binding of IFNAR2 (23). The binding site for IFNAR1 in the IFN-\u03b12 molecule is formed by the \u03b1-helices B, C, and D (Fig. 1, A and B).",

These IFNs were named IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3 or IL29, IL28A, and IL28B, owing to their shared features with both type I IFN and the members of the IL10 family. The crystal structure of huIFN-\u03bb3 was identified at the 2.8 \u212b level (30\u201332), and further evidence was obtained that the type III IFNs initiated signaling by binding to a common receptor composed of IFNLR1 and IL10R2 (33) (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the crystal structures of huIFN-\u03bb1 complex with its high-affinity receptor IFNLR1 (34) and huIL10R2 extracellular domain were also determined (35). The basic structure of the huIFN-\u03bb1 (34) and huIFN-\u03bb3 (30\u201332) is a 5-helix bundle (or elements A, C, D, E, F in the cited papers (26, 29, 30\u201332)). They are marked in Fig. 3 as A, B, C, D, E to facilitate comparison with type I IFNs. The topology of huIFN-\u03bb1 and huIFN-\u03bb3 is described by \u201cup-up-down-up-down\u201d 5-\u03b1-helix-bundle motif found previously for type I IFNs (20, 23).",

The long AB loop or element B in the cited papers (30\u201332) in huIFN-\u03bb3 is less rigid and adapts a flexible coil structure, whereas in huIFN-\u03b12 the residues 26\u201329, 30\u201333, and 40\u201343 within the AB loop form 3 turns of 310 helix (310 A, 310 B, and 310 C) (20). Although the helix 310 A is linked to the N-terminus of \u03b1-helix E by a disulfide bond, it is flexible in solution. Out of 7 Cys residues in huIFN-\u03bb3, 6 Cys residues form intramolecular disulfide bonds, whereas Cys48 is free in solution (30\u201332). Of the 3 intramolecular disulfide bonds, the first disulfide bond between Cys16 and Cys115 connects the N-terminus to the end of \u03b1-helix C, the second disulfide bond between Cys50 and Cys148 connects the AB loop to the beginning of helix E, and the third disulfide bond between Cys157 and Cys164 forms a small loop at the end of helix E.",

The activated JAKs phosphorylate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 that induces their heterodimerization (STAT1-STAT2) (2, 3). The dimer recruits the interferon response factor 9 to form a trimeric transcription factor complex named as the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) that migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to the interferon-stimulated response element, thus promoting the transcription of the ISGs, including mx1 and mx2. The repertoire of genes induced by type III IFNs is essentially the same as the 1 induced by type I IFNs (37, 38), and as a consequence, type I and III IFNs display many of the same biological activities\u2014including the antiviral activity\u2014in a wide variety of target cells (2). Expression of the type III IFN genes and their corresponding proteins are inducible by infection with many types of viruses, and this process also applies to the genes induced by the type I IFNs. However, unlike the type I IFN receptors that are produced on most cell types, type III IFN receptors are mostly restricted to cells of epithelial origin (2).",

Their expression is strictly controlled by type I and III IFNs (7, 14, 15). In humans, MX1 (also known as MxA) and MX2 (also known as MxB) are encoded by closely linked genes on the long arm of chromosome 21 (map position 21q22.3) (10). Opposite to other IFN-stimulated genes, mx genes generally are not induced directly by viruses and are not expressed constitutively.

The globular G domain comprises a central core consisting of 6 \u03b2-strands surrounded by \u03b1-helical segments. It is linked to a stalk that is composed of 4 long \u03b1-helices. The G domain binds and hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and is located at the opposite site of the extended stalk in the MxA monomer (Fig. 5A). The connection between the G domain and the stalk is formed by the BSE. It is composed of 3 \u03b1-helices derived from the flanking regions of the G domain and the very C-terminal part of the molecule that folds back to the N-terminal G domain (Fig. 5A). The BSE is thought to function as a mediator of conformational coupling between the G domain and the stalk; it transmits a signal from the stalk to the G domain and vice versa transfers structural changes induced by GTP binding and hydrolysis to the stalk (41). The MxA molecule is flexible owing to the 2 hinge-like regions. Real-time domain dynamics of MxA were studied by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (42). The G-domain-BSE region can adopt either an \u201copen\u201d or \u201cclosed\u201d conformation in all nucleotide-loading conditions. Whereas the open conformation is preferred by the nucleotide-free, GDP \u00b7 AlF4\u2212 -bound and GDP-bound forms, the loading of GTP activates the relative movement between the 2 domains and alters the conformational preference to a \u201cclosed\u201d state. Moreover, frequent relative movement was observed to occur between the BSE and the stalk via hinge 1 (Fig. 5A). It was suggested that the MxA molecules within a helical polymer could collectively generate a stable torque through random cycles of GTP hydrolysis (42). The stalk mediates a ring formation by assembling the molecules in a zigzag fashion (Fig. 5B) (6). Cryotransmission electron microscopy shows that the G domains are directed to the outer side of the multimeric rings, whereas the stalks are directed to the opposite inner side (43) (Fig. 5B).",

In particular, it has been demonstrated that MxA protein inhibits the multiplication of negative strand RNA viruses such as influenza virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, measles virus, and other viruses belonging to the family Bunyaviridae (46). In addition, it has been found that MxA-transfected cells were protected against Semliki Forest virus, a togavirus with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity, whereas they were not protected against the multiplication of other positive-stranded RNA virus, mengovirus, and encephalomyocarditis virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family (46). The stably transfected Vero cells producing MxA in 98% of cells have been used to test the antiviral activity of MxA against coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) (46). In Vero cells producing MxA, CVB4 yields were dramatically reduced. In addition, production of the VP1 CVB protein analyzed by immunofluorescence was highly restricted in comparison with control cells. Moreover, the accumulation of negative- and positive-strand CVB4 RNA was prevented, as shown by in situ hybridization and reverse transcription PCR. The obtained results evidently demonstrate the antiviral activity of MxA against CVB4 and indicate that its replication is inhibited at an early step in Vero cells producing MxA.",

Recently some well-studied DNA viruses representing the Poxviridae family were tested for their sensitivity to MxA (48). A cell line induced to produce inhibitory concentrations of MxA showed no antivaccinia virus activity, indicating either a lack of susceptibility of the virus or the existence of viral factors capable of counteracting the MxA inhibition. To determine if the VACV resistance to MxA was due to a virus-encoded anti-MxA activity, VACV and the MxA-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus were coinfected (48). It was shown that VACV does not protect the vesicular stomatitis virus from the MxA inhibition at the protein level. Those results were extended to several additional VACV strains and 2 CPXV strains, thus confirming that these orthopoxviruses do not block the MxA action. Overall, these results point to a lack of susceptibility of the Poxviridae to MxA antiviral activity.",

In this model, Mx forms tetramers that at higher Mx concentrations can further oligomerize into large Mx rings (Fig. 5B) (43). GTPase domains are situated on the outside of the ring, and stalks are directed inwards. Furthermore, the Mx rings can interact through their GTPase domains, increasing the GTPase activity. The C-termini of the Mx proteins are important for binding of the viral targets. Such a mode of assembly and oligomerization possibly leads to multiple Mx rings wrapping around the viral target structures (15). The arrangement of repetitive nucleoprotein or capsid protein molecules potentiates multiple bonds with the Mx oligomers. Therefore, even a low-affinity interaction could result in a high-avidity binding. Mx rings could prevent the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes with the viral polymerase, thereby suppressing virus transcription or replication (Fig. 6) (15). The Mx rings could also translocate viral nucleoproteins or capsid proteins to perinuclear complexes in a GTPase-dependent manner, leading to their degradation. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which Mx GTPases inhibit the susceptible viruses need further elucidation (39).",

The Assembly declared that \u201cDecisions to prescribe antibiotics are rarely based on definitive diagnoses.

Blood samples and nasal swabs were taken from 153 and 77 children with and without symptoms of respiratory infections, respectively, and tested with ELISA. The respiratory viruses in nasal swabs were tested with PCR-based detection. Respiratory viruses were detected in 81% of symptomatic children. These symptomatic children had significantly higher MxA (median [interquartile range]) concentrations in blood: 695 (345\u20131370) \u03bcg/L compared with control group 110 (55\u2013170) \u03bcg/L; P < 0.001. In asymptomatic children, no significant differences were observed in MxA responses between the virus-positive and virus-negative groups. A cutoff value equal to 175 \u03bcg/L had a 92% clinical sensitivity and 77% clinical specificity for a symptomatic respiratory virus infection. Rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus infections were also characterized by increased MxA concentrations. Asymptomatic virus-negative children vaccinated with a live virus vaccine had increased MxA protein concentrations of 240 (120\u2013540) \u03bcg/L but had significantly lower concentrations than children with an acute respiratory infection who had not received vaccinations: 740 (350\u20131425) \u03bcg/L; P < 0.001. All in all, the concentrations of MxA protein in blood are increased in young children with symptomatic respiratory virus infections, including rhinovirus infections. Thus, MxA is an informative general marker for the most common acute virus infections.",

However, these biomarkers lack adequate clinical specificity to differentiate a viral from a bacterial infection and ultimately lead to antibiotic overtreatment of viral infections. Moreover, the performance characteristics of CRP as a marker for bacterial infections vary considerable among published studies and are heavily influenced by the organ system involved and numerous comorbidities. Therefore, procalcitonin, which is gaining favor as a more specific biomarker of bacterial infection, should also be included in the diagnostics (76).",
