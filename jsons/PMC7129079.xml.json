However, intact protein reaching the distal small intestine and colon will increase bacterial ammonia production, alter bacterial numbers and species, and may contribute to colitis or colonic hypersensitivity.6 Furthermore, protein antigens in food are responsible for the development of most food hypersensitivity reactions in dogs and cats.",

Animals with food allergies may have an immediate hypersensititivity reaction to the protein, or may have a delayed (ie, type IV) response, thus the signs may be quite variable.7, 8 Nevertheless, a combination of intestinal and/or dermatologic signs, including vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, pruritus, hair loss, or otitis externa, often develop in animals with food sensitivity.9 In animals with GI diseases causing severe mucosal disruption (eg, inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], lymphoma), intact proteins may cross the mucosa-exposing the immune cells of the lamina propria to these antigens, and potentially predisposing to the development of hypersensitivity to that protein. For that reason, feeding a \u201csacrificial\u201d diet during the initial stages of therapy of severe GI disease until the inflammation is controlled is sometimes recommended.10 Once the inflammatory disease is suppressed with steroid or other immune suppressive drugs, a new highly digestible or novel antigen diet is introduced and fed as long-term therapy. One alternative to the sacrificial diet is to feed a hydrolyzed diet (eg, a highly digestible, low fat diet that contains no intact proteins, only peptides <15,000 Daltons (D), which in theory are not large enough to serve as antigens) (Fig 1). However, there are no data available to support or refute this claim. Although feeding hydrolyzed diets may not completely eliminate the possibility of immune stimulation, anecdotal evidence suggests that feeding these diets may be beneficial for some animals with severe small intestinal disease or food sensitivity.",

Obviously, this may be easier said than done, requiring an appropriate diet that meets the pet\u2019s nutritional needs for maintenance, while also serving as a therapeutic diet for correction of the GI and allergic signs. As a reminder, when a food trial is used to diagnose a food allergy, a minimum of 6 to 8 weeks on the new (novel) diet is required to determine its effectiveness: 2 to 4 weeks for the inflammatory response initiated by the old proteins to subside and another 3 to 4 weeks with the new protein \u201con board\u201d to see if the clinical signs resolve.11 It is also worth repeating that it is essential to have a good dietary history to determine which protein sources have been previously fed, and it is equally important to be sure the owner understands the importance of not feeding any other foods, treats, or even flavors to the pet during the trial period.",

This result is primarily because most nutrient dense foods are higher in fat, which slows gastric emptying in dogs and humans, but not cats.1, 3 In contrast to the effects of protein, increased levels of dietary fat decrease the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter and may lead to an increased risk of gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting.1, 4 Because digestion and absorption of fat is a complex process, malassimilation of fat in animals with GI disease is common. Undigested fats or fatty acids reaching the distal ileum or colon may be fermented by bacteria (especially non-beneficial species), resulting in the formation of pro-inflammatory and pro-secretory hydroxy fatty acids. These hydroxy fatty acids may be injurious to the mucosa or can be a cause of osmotic diarrhea.1, 12 Nevertheless, the complete absence of fat from the diet is undesirable and may lead to a deficiency of essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids must be supplied to provide the phospholipid and cholesterol building blocks for cellular growth and repair, which are especially important in the GI tract for the synthesis of new mucosal epithelial cells. Dietary fat enhances the palatability and acceptance of food, and is an essential energy source in sick or injured animals that cannot effectively use CHO during periods of stressed starvation.2\n",

In humans with ulcerative colitis, addition of fish oils to the diet resulted in a reduction in inflammatory mediators, improved mucosal function and fluidity, and the reduced usage of anti-inflammatory drugs to maintain control of the disease.13 The clinical benefit of fish oils for the treatment of inflammatory skin disease in dogs is well recognized. However, studies specifically assessing a reduction of intestinal inflammation in dogs and cats fed omega 3 fatty acids are lacking. Nevertheless, several pet food manufacturers have added omega 3 fatty acids to their therapeutic diet formulations to provide anti-inflammatory potential to their highly digestible and hypoallergenic diets.",

CHO digestibility is determined by its origin and the degree of cooking (eg, rice and wheat are generally highly digestible, while uncooked maize or potato starch are less digestible).14 Malassimilation of CHO results in the development of osmotic diarrhea, production of increased intestinal gas (flatus), loss of water and electrolytes, increased bacterial fermentation in both the small intestine and colon, overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, and acidification of the colonic luminal environment promoting formation of hydroxy fatty acids and other potentially toxic intermediates.4, 14 White rice is the best CHO source for most dogs with GI disease and is found in most commercial, therapeutic highly digestible diets because it is gluten free (some dogs, especially Irish setters and soft coated Wheaten terriers, are sensitive to gluten or a sensitivity to gluten may develop, which is present in wheat, oats, and barley), readily digestible, and nonantigenic.1, 4, 14, 15 Other gluten-free CHO sources include potato, corn, and tapioca.

Fibers are soluble if they form gels in solution (thus attracting water), delay gastric emptying and slow intestinal transit, inhibit the absorption of cholesterol and some other nutrients, are poor bulking agents, are highly fermentable in the colon (eg, increase numbers of bacteria and increase short chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, an essential colonic fuel source), acidify the lumen, and stimulate colonic cellular proliferation.14, 16, 17 Examples of soluble fibers include fructooligosaccharides (FOS), pectins, psyllium, oats, barley, guar gum, fruits, and some legumes.14 Alternatively, insoluble fibers do not form gels, have no effect on gastric emptying, increase or \u201cnormalize\u201d intestinal transit, have no effect on nutrient absorption, are good bulking agents (eg, dilute colonic content, and, thus, bind noxious agents in the colon), are fermented less, so produce fewer short chain fatty acids, and increase fecal weight.1, 14, 16 Typical examples of insoluble fibers are cellulose, wheat and rye fibers (most cereal fibers), and the woody parts of plants (eg, lignins).14\n",

For example, in dogs or cats refusing to eat postoperatively, administration of appropriate analgesics may remove the cause of inappetence (eg, pain) and result in the return of appetite. For animals with anorexia caused by delayed gastric emptying or ileus, the use of prokinetic drugs, such as metoclopramide or ranitidine, may be beneficial. Where feasible, both reductions in environmental stressors as well as providing a highly palatable dietary source are important to provide the optimal situation for improving intake.

This is best illustrated by the array of commercial diets available for the treatment of colitis in dogs. Some are based strictly on the presence of increased concentrations of insoluble fiber (eg, Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet w/d [Topeka, KS] or Purina OM [Ralston Purina Co, St. Louis, MO]), others are based on mixed fiber sources (Purina DCO), and yet others have primarily soluble fiber sources (Iams Low Residue [The Iams Co, Dayton, OH]). Nevertheless, there is general agreement that dietary fibers enhance normal colonic function in dogs, primarily by providing fuel sources through fermentation of the more soluble fibers (eg, short chain fatty acids such as butyrate), and by increasing fecal bulk with the insoluble fibers, which promotes normalized colonic motor functions and defecation. In a recent study of dogs with colitis, the addition of dietary fiber to treatment of the disease resulted in a significant clinical improvement over dogs fed diets without added fiber.28\n",

Alternatively, high fiber diets can be used to prevent constipation, as long as the colon is functional (eg, not in cats with idiopathic megacolon or colonic atony due to electrolyte imbalance), there is no obstructive disease (eg, pelvic fractures, neoplasia, or strictures), and the patient is well hydrated. High insoluble fiber diets cannot be used to treat constipation. They will simply increase the fecal mass and hardness, primarily due to the colon\u2019s impressive ability to remove water from the feces.

In most cases, foods high in insoluble fiber do not cause an increase in intestinal gas because they are not highly fermented, but diets with mixed fiber sources or higher concentrations of soluble fibers can cause higher gas production because the bacteria ferment the fiber. The best dietary approach to reduce the formation of intestinal gas is to reduce the substrate available to the bacteria in the colon.

However, there will be occasions when more aggressive nutritional therapy, using either the placement of feeding tubes or by intravenous feeding methods, will be necessary to provide nutrition for the patient. The most common circumstances requiring intervention are animals with persistent vomiting or other obstructive processes that preclude the use of the GI tract until the problem can be solved. Examples include GI lymphoma, gastric outflow obstruction caused by, for instance, fungal or neoplastic disease, or animals with severe pancreatitis requiring upper bowel rest. The general rule of thumb for decision making in these animals is that under circumstances of stress starvation, the pet should not be allowed to go without food for longer than 3 to 5 days.29 If this circumstance is occurring, then aggressive intervention is not only warranted for nutritional management, it is also essential for survival. Because it is beyond the scope of this article to review the approach to nutrition of these critically ill patients, the reader is referred to several recent reviews on the subject for additional information.29, 30 However, for those interested in maximizing their patient care, a few simple rules are offered: 1.Use the most cephalad part of the GI tract that is functioning when selecting the route for enteral nutrition (eg, if the jaw is broken, place an esophageal tube, if the dog has megaesophagus, place a gastrostomy tube).2.If the gut is not working or the patient is not stable enough for the placement of tubes for enteral support, provide intravenous nutritional support at the level of your ability-at the very least, peripheral parenteral nutrition should be possible in most small animal practices.30\n3.Calculate caloric needs, and select diets based on the patient\u2019s primary problem. Do not guess calories and then feed a high calorie recovery diet (eg, Hill\u2019s a/dor Iams Maximum Calorie) because the GI tract may not be able to tolerate the high fat content.4.Start slowly, feed small meals frequently, and work up to the full caloric needs of that animal over several days.5.If necessary, combine enteral and parenteral nutrition together if the GI tract is unable to tolerate (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, or discomfort develops) full enteral feeding.\n",
