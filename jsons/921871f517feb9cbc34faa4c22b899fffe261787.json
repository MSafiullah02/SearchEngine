In this overview paper, we summarize the past workshops, present the workshop topics for 2020 and reflect on some future steps for this workshop series.",

Our next strategic step is the First Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing (SDP) 2 will be held in November 2020 in conjunction with the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. This workshop and initiative will be organized by a diverse group of researchers (organizers from BIR, BIRNDL, Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications/WOSP and Big Scholar) which have expertise in NLP, ML, Text Summarization/Mining, Computational Linguistics, Discourse Processing, IR, and others.",
