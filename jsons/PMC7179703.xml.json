The 65-year-old man with underlying health conditions had flown with his wife from Wuhan to Hanoi after the outbreak. The man became ill with fever and fatigue 4 days after traveling and was tested positive for COVID-19 after hospital admission. His son who lives in another city and with no history of traveling to these regions was found to be positive as well, and the investigation showed that he met his parents after they had traveled and stayed with them for 3 days. This article explains the time frame of events very precisely and the possible transmission of the virus from the father to the son after the contact. Although the son has got the infection, the man's wife and the 28 individuals contacted by the family during their travels were found to be healthy and tested negative to the virus, which requires further explanations and studies to investigate the possible risk factors and the modes of transmission. Furthermore, sequencing of strains from the father and son is needed to confirm the transmission between the two.",
