The uncertainty associated with the presence and effects of COVID-19, inaccurate news reports, the population's misunderstanding of health messages, travel bans and isolation, and lack of trustworthy sources of information have added considerable mental stress (Wang et al., 2020) . The rapid increase in reported infections and increased mortality associated with the pandemic is triggering common mental disorders, including anxiety and depressive disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder in people including youth and older adults, people with underlying health conditions, and people in quarantine or isolation; all can lead to serious negative outcomes that exceed the clinical consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic itself.",

In this regard, recently an online dissemination session for the public was carried out by first author to increase awareness about how to maintain psychological wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown in Iraq. More than a thousand people from various backgrounds participated, and almost half of them reported psychological distresses related to the pandemic. During the session, the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations to support mental and psychosocial well-being disseminated as well (WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use., 2020). One of the participants stated \"We have experienced war and displacement many times, we cannot stand stress anymore.\" Another participant shared \"My whole family and friends are terrified; this pandemic has frightened us even more\".",

Along with other health professionals (Xiang et al., 2020) , we strongly believe that there is a critical need to implement mental health services in affected countries and to include mental health care in the national public health COVID-19 emergency program of Iraq. Therefore, we call on medical and mental health professionals to develop a comprehensive program via media outlets, e.g., news channels, and social media platforms, e.g., Facebook, Instagram, to address communities in distress. Since the use of these outlets increases when people are isolated and lack mental health services, the need for appropriate mental health care is increasing in the country.",
