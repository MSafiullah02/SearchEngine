Stillmark (1888) enunciated first lectin (then called hemagglutinin) from seeds of Ricinus communis. After that thousands of lectins have been isolated from different sources including plant seeds and roots, bacteria, algae, fungi, body fluid of invertebrates, lower vertebrates and mammalian cell membranes (Singh et al., 1999). They are type cast with respect to carbohydrate-binding specificity, molecular structure, biochemical and biomedical properties. Among microbes, occurrence of lectins has been widely reported from algae and mushrooms (Singh et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The presence of agglutinins in marine algae was firstly reported by Boyd et al. (1966). Later on, lectins have been reported from a large number of algae. Algal lectins are generally referred to as phycolectins (Matsubara et al., 1996; Rogers et al., 1977) and they differ from plant lectins in a variety of physico-chemical characteristics. In general, marine algal lectins are monomeric, low molecular weight proteins, exhibiting high content of acidic amino acids, with isoelectric point (pI) in the range of 4\u20136, do not require metal ions for their biological activities and most of them show specificity for glycoproteins than monosaccharides (Hori et al., 1990; Rogers & Hori, 1993; Shiomi et al., 1981). Based on the binding properties to glycoproteins, algal lectins are categorized into three major categories, complex type N-glycan specific lectins, high mannose (HM) type N-glycan specific lectins and lectins with specificity to both the above types of N-glycans (Hori et al., 1990). Mannose binding lectins are considered essential as they interplay with cell-surface glycoconjugates. Due to their small size and presence of disulphide linkages, algal lectins are antigenic and highly stable. Furthermore, the peculiar small structure of algal lectins makes them more expedient for use as specific molecular diagnostic probes against the cell surface carbohydrates and in drug targeting (Nascimento et al., 2006). Recently, algal lectins have received greater attention due to their robust oligosaccharide-binding specificity (Okuyama et al., 2009).",

They concluded that marine algal agglutinins are most sensitive to protease treated sheep erythrocytes followed by native rabbit and sheep erythrocytes, but not to human and chicken red blood cells. Caulerpa cupressoides lectin agglutinated trypsin treated sheep, rabbit and chicken erythrocytes (Ainouz & Sampaio, 1991). Lectin activity increased significantly when rabbit red blood cells were treated with trypsin, bromelain, papain and subtilisin, but chicken erythrocytes treated with only bromelain showed agglutination (Freitas et al., 1997). Serraticardia maxima lectin has been reported to agglutinate native, trypsin and papain treated erythrocytes of horse, cow, sheep, rabbit, guinea pig, mouse and chicken. Non-treated horse erythrocytes were most agglutinated, while non-treated cow erythrocytes were least agglutinated (Shiomi et al., 1980).

Therefore, the hunt for new compounds for controlling pain and inflammation with low side effects has switched to marine algae.

E. serra agglutinin (ESA) induced cell-death of colon cancer Colo201 cells and cervix cancer HeLa cells (Sugahara et al., 2001).

BCA revealed potent antiviral activity against most of the influenza virus strains tested by binding to the envelope HA (a trimeric glycoprotein expressed on influenza virus membrane) including a clinical isolate of pandemic H1N1-2009 virus (Sato et al., 2011b). Lectin isolated from K. alvarezii (KAA-2) exhibited strong antiviral activity against broad range of influenza virus strains including Swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus; regardless of the virus subtype and strain. Inhibition of influenza virus propagation occurred due to the blocking of viral entry into the host cell by binding to HM glycans on the surface envelope glycoprotein HA. This clearly indicates that KAA-2 completely inhibits yeast mannan bearing HM glycans and binds strongly to HA via HM glycans. The strain-independent inhibition by KAA-2 might be more effective than antibody-based medicines that are more prone to antigenic shift/drift. KAA-2 can be used as novel antiviral agent (Sato et al., 2011a).",

            "text": "In a recent groundbreaking study, griffithsin from Griffithsia sp. has been reported to be a potent inhibitor of the life-cycle of the coronavirus which is responsible for SARS. The antiviral potency of griffithsin is due to presence of multiple, sugar binding sites that provide robust attachment points for complex carbohydrate molecules present on viral envelopes. Such broad antiviral activity of this lectin makes it a promising candidate for the development of a novel antiviral agent (Ziolkowska & Wlodawer, 2006). Lectin CV-N showed an inclusive variety of antiviral activity for influenza viruses (A and B), Ebola virus, human herpes virus 6, HCV and measles virus (Barrientos et al., 2003; Dey et al., 2000; Helle et al., 2006; O\u2019Keefe et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Algal proteins with antiviral activities have now \u201cemerged\u201d in the anti-HIV battlefield displaying immense dormant applications as topical agents (Feizi et al., 2011). Most of the research on anti-HIV activity of marine algae has converged upon red and brown macroalgae (Schaeffer & Krylov, 2000). High-mannose binding nature of algal lectins makes them expedient candidates for inhibiting HIV (Botos & Woldawer, 2005). They interact with glycans and cells of the host, thus disturbing proteins of viral envelope and cells of the host. A number of lectins isolated from red algae exhibit inhibitory activity against HIV. Griffithsin/GRFT isolated from Griffithsia sp. is a completely novel protein with no homology to any of the proteins listed in BLAST database. GRFT displays potent antiviral activity against both laboratory-adapted strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 (Alexandre et al., 2010; Charan et al., 2000; Giomarelli et al., 2006; Ziolkowska & Wlodawer, 2006) at subnanomolar concentrations (IC50 = 0.4 nm and EC50 = 0.043\u20130.63) which inhibits cell fusion and cell-to-cell HIV transmission (Emau et al., 2007) in contrast to several other monosaccharide-specific lectins from same structural family. GRFT is not only the strongest HIV inhibitor manifesting broad spectrum activity against various clades of HIV, but also acts as an initiation point for the design of smaller peptide-based antiviral minilectins which can be directed against high-mannose sugars (Micewicz et al., 2010). CV-N lectin purified from N. ellipsosporum shares no similarity with other protein sequences which are deposited so far in public protein databases. CV-N is a potential inhibitor of both laboratory adapted and clinically isolated strains of HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (Bewley et al., 1998; Dey et al., 2000). Furthermore, CV-N prevents in vitro fusion and transmission of HIV-1 between infected and non-infected cells (Boyd et al., 1997). CV-N is highly resistant to physico-chemical denaturations which are caused by various denaturants, detergents, organic solvents, multiple freeze thaw cycles and heat up to 100 \u00b0C with no loss of antiviral activity. These characteristics further boost its potential as an anti-HIV microbicide (Bewley et al., 1998; Boyd et al., 1997). GRFT, CV-N and SVN are mannose specific lectins found interacting with mannose-rich glycans present on the viral envelope and blocking HIV-1 entry in vitro. This supports their potential as microbicides or topical virucide to prevent sexual transmission of HIV and AIDS (Alexandre et al., 2010; Mori et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The envelope glycoprotein of HIV (gp120) is among the most heavily glycosylated proteins known so far. Up to 50% of this 120-kDa glycoprotein is contributed by N-linked carbohydrates. In particular, HIV gp120 contains 20\u201329 N-glycosylation sites depending on the nature of the viral isolate and the type of virus clade. Highly dense carbohydrate shield on gp120 has been found to be responsible for its low antigenicity and low immunogenicity. It also protects the virus against the immune system (Balzarini et al., 2005). Envelope glycoprotein gp120 and gp 41 of HIV-1 forms a trimer complex that mediates virus entry into target cells through receptor binding events. As demonstrated in studies, gp120 is composed of variable region (V1\u2013V5) and constant regions (C1\u2013C5). V3 loop acts as the major determinant of viral entry. Carbohydrate moieties are affirmed to act as shields for gp120 which is highly glycosylated. Thus, carbohydrate-binding agents including CV-N and griffithsin inhibit HIV-1 infection (Hu et al., 2007).",

Low molecular weights of algal lectins play a vital role in the study of neutrophil migration as this prevents steric problems (Neves et al., 2001). Lectin bryohealin from B. plumosa has the potential of wound-healing (Jung et al., 2010).

Interestingly, algal lectins are also used in antiadhesion trials. Lectins BTL and BSL have been shown to block adhesion of Streptococci to their mucin receptors in acquired pellicle via competition mechanism (Teixeira et al., 2007). These lectins interfere both with bacterial adhesion and aggregation. Thus, antiadhesion lectin therapy is a promising solution to the problems of caries. Lectins are widely used in lectinosorbent assays which characterize cell-binding patterns (Smit, 2004).",

The ultimate goal is to develop emphatic microbicides that not only stymie the transmission of cell-free viruses but also the transmission of donar-HIV infected T-cells and guards against other STDs (Huskens & Schols, 2012). The sugar binding specificity of lectins towards glycoconjugates has made them captivating proteins.

The specific coupling and greater pH stability of algal lectins showed reversible linkage of algal lectins to drug enhancing penetration of drugs which can be used for targeting drugs to tumor tissue and for oral drug delivery. A number of lacunae still persist which need to be filled. Even though an invigorative role of many lectins has been evident, further pharmacokinetic studies need to be endeavored before their introduction as clinical tools. Distinct sources should be traversed to confine avant-grade lectins with dormant dupable properties. Sanguinely, further groundwork is required to endow in vivo succor of these algal lectins equivalent to their in vitro effects and can be carried forward for the development of oral drug delivery systems, mucoadhesive formulations, lectinosorbent assays and development of efficient, safe and affordable microbicides. In case of anti-HIV drugs what is now needed is to determine precisely the distinctive features among numerous lectins that confer antiviral activity. Thus, it would be possible to engineer proteins with multiple binding sites recognizing different motifs for use as anti-HIV drugs with enhanced potencies (Feizi et al., 2011). The author realizes that the need of the hour is to characterize and overcome the shortcomings in purification of algal lectins for exploring immense empire of algal lectins for biomedical applications.",
