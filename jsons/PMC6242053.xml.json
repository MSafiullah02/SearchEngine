However, in-office spread of these infections has not been reported, possibly because it is difficult to distinguish between office and community exposures. Young children have 4 to 10 respiratory infections and up to 4 episodes of gastroenteritis per year (16,17). They can acquire infections in child care, at school, in crowded shopping malls or recreational centres, or from siblings, parents, other family contacts, friends, or caregivers. In one study, rates of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in healthy children younger than 3 years of age who had visited the doctor\u2019s office over the preceding week were compared with infection rates in control children from the same paediatric practice who had not visited the office in the same period. No increased risk of infection was observed: 30% of those who visited the office and 32% of those who did not developed an infection (18). One study at the Montreal Children\u2019s Hospital, in Montreal, Quebec, did not find a significant difference in rates of new respiratory or gastrointestinal infections between children who had visited the emergency room over the previous week (17.3%) and those who had not (23.4%) (19). In contrast, another study reported an increased risk of influenza-like illness in a family member in the 2 weeks following a well-child visit (20).",

Thus, respiratory viruses may be transmitted by inhalation, by depositing large droplets onto mucous membranes or by inoculating nasal mucosa or conjunctiva by contaminated hands. Surgical or procedure masks can protect personnel from acquisition via deposition of droplets on mucous membranes and may also help to keep hands away from nose and mouth. Eye shields give added protection against infection via the conjunctiva. Face shields or goggles have been shown to prevent RSV infection in health care personnel (37,38). RSV transmission to personnel was also reduced when they wore gloves but used no masks or eye protection, probably because personnel are less likely to touch their noses or eyes with gloved hands. This finding suggests that for RSV, contact transmission may be more important than droplet transmission (39,40).",

            "text": "\nAirborne transmission occurs when infectious particles survive in aerosols of small, desiccated droplets from the respiratory tract or aerosols from skin squames, which remain suspended in the air and are dispersed over large distances by air currents. Control requires a negative-pressure room with air exhausted outside the building or passed through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculation. Special tight-fitting masks with built-in filters that remove particles down to 1 micron in diameter at 95% efficacy (N95) are recommended for susceptible persons who must enter the room. Airborne transmission is uncommon but important because varicella, measles, tuberculosis, and smallpox are spread by this route. Although evidence suggests that infections such as SARS coronavirus, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, avian influenza and viral hemorrhagic fevers are transmitted by large droplet and contact spread, it is thought that small particle aerosols generated during certain procedures, such as intubation or bronchoscopy, may result in airborne transmission over short distances (1,4,41,42).",
