            "text": "The concept of RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), provides an opportunity for a whole new class of drugs directed towards disease-associated genes. However, before RNAi can be used to its full potential for treatment of a variety of diseases, challenges regarding the delivery of siRNA need to be overcome [1]. A promising approach to overcoming delivery challenges related to stability and cellular targeting of siRNA is local delivery of siRNA directly onto the diseased tissue using a delivery system capable of protecting the siRNA from degradation [1], [2]. Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) have been proposed for delivering macromolecules, such as siRNA, to the cytosol of cells in vitro\n[3], [4]. The NPs have been shown to be taken up by endocytosis and can escape the endosomes to a certain degree before degradation [4] and subsequently release the drug, although the mechanism of endosomal escape is unclear at present. Once present in the cytosol, the PLGA is suggested to be degraded slowly, sustaining the release of encapsulated siRNA, a property which might be very useful for therapeutic purposes [3].",

            "text": "In this perspective, the airways are interesting sites for local delivery of siRNA. The lungs are exposed to a variety of pollutants on a daily basis and are therefore also susceptible to a wide range of diseases. Examples of airway-located diseases, which would be treatable with siRNA, are cancer and infections like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and influenza [2], [5]. Diseases may affect different parts of the airways, which branch out approximately 17 times before ending up in the alveoli [6]. However, many infections are localized in the lower airways [7], [8], so efficient delivery systems must be developed to treat airway diseases. Even though the total alveoli surface area of 100\u2013150 m2 in adults provides a large surface for drug deposition [9], the branching, mucociliary clearance and breathing are mechanisms that prevent particles from entering the lower airways. To overcome these barriers and achieve particle deposition in the lower airways, the size distribution and aerodynamic behaviour of the particles intended for inhalation are of great importance. The aerodynamic diameter can be used to predict the behaviour of a given particle in an airstream and thereby predict the site of impact with airway epithelium. Larger particles with an aerodynamic diameter above 5 \u00b5m will most likely impact with the tissue of the mouth, throat or upper lung mucosa and be eliminated from there, whereas particles smaller than 1 \u00b5m will often suffer from being exhaled and thus not be deposited in the alveoli. When formulating drugs for pulmonary delivery, another issue to be considered is the clearance mechanism for particles deposited in the deeper areas of the lungs. The clearance in the deeper areas of the lungs is mostly provided by pulmonary macrophages, which are mobile phagocytic cells monitoring the inner surface of the alveoli by ingesting and degrading pathogens and particles. Even though micro-sized particles will be processed by the pulmonary macrophages, NPs with a diameter smaller than approximately 260 nm might escape macrophage clearance [10], [11].",

The methodology of spray drying enables formation of particles of a size suitable for inhalation comprising both NPs and an excipient [12], [13], [14]. Furthermore, nanocomposite microparticles composed of PLGA NPs and sugars, such as trehalose and lactose, have been shown to decompose in the lung lining fluid, releasing the NPs from the formulation [12], [13], [14]. The spray drying process is widely applied for production of inhalable particles, and allows for a large degree of variation of the final product. Spray drying has previously been used for a number of applications, including the preparation of dry powder protein particles intended for inhalation [15], [16], as well as dry powder containing cationic PLGA nanoparticles, the latter to prevent aggregation and loss of transfection potential when subsequently complexed to pDNA [17].",

Several parameters in the drying process itself, as well as the composition of the feed formulation, greatly influence the characteristics of the dry end product [18], [19]. Carbohydrate excipients function as bulking agents that enable production of stable particles of a size suitable for inhalation and allow a rapid release of the NPs in the lung lining fluid upon inhalation. Also, the excipients are added to the formulation to provide some degree of protection of the NPs and the encapsulated drug (in this case siRNA) during the process of spray drying, in particular against shear forces and increased temperatures. Excipients like mannitol, trehalose and lactose are commonly used in spray drying with satisfying end products [13], [20]. These carbohydrates are dissolvable in water [21] and possess good safety profiles and are thus good choices for the production of the nanocomposite microparticles, which should decompose quickly in the lung lining fluid.",

The instrument employed a time of flight principle, measuring the velocity of the individual particles where the aerodynamic diameter was defined as the diameter of a spherical particle with the same velocity and behaviour as the analyzed particle. The resulting particle size distribution accounted for the density, was number based and was afterwards converted to a mass based particle size distribution by the software provided with the instrument. A few mg of spray dried powder was placed on the turntable inside the Small-Scale Powder Disperser and introduced into the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer by a Venturi aspirator. The flow rate and the rotation rate of the Small-Scale Powder Disperser were controlled to yield a particle concentration in the range of 0.3\u20133.0 mg/m3 and analysis was carried out continuously for 20 s. It was assumed that the shear forces present in the Small-Scale Powder Disperser were sufficient to deagglomerate the spray dried particles, which might not be the case for pharmaceutical devices used for inhalation therapy. For powders dispersed with metered dose inhalers the aerodynamic particle size obtained with the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer Spectrometer 3321 correlated well with the aerodynamic particle size obtained with cascade impactors [24], [25]. The formulation in the present study was spray dried and the dry powder was assumed to be chemically homogeneous making the chemical analysis of the cascade impactors less important. In the following text, the aerodynamic particle size is given as the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD).",

The dry powder yield was significantly affected by the ratio of NPs to excipient (P\n = 0.0063), as increasing the ratio lead to a lower yield. Also, the yield was dependent on the concentration of total dry substance in the feed formulation (P\n = 0.0016), since a higher yield was obtained at increased concentrations. However, the effect of concentration on the yield could also be due to a reduced loss in the collection process, since larger amounts were used with increasing concentrations. To ensure that no bias was imposed on the result by the use of different batches of NPs, the effect of the batch of NPs on the different outcomes was examined. No significant difference was observed from the variation of the NP batches (data not shown).",

The nanocomposite microparticles were all shown to be of acceptable quality, proving that the chosen fixed parameters were suitable. However, nanocomposite microparticles containing mannitol showed a significantly lower water content than the other formulations. The low water content in the powder is highly desirable, since it will decrease interparticulate cohesion and thereby increase the respirability of the powder [15], [27]. A high water content might also have a negative effect on the stability of the product [15]. For these reasons, mannitol was chosen for all succeeding studies. The ratio of NPs to excipient was also shown to have an effect on the water content; increasing the ratio provided a lower moisture content. However, this effect was minor compared to the effect of using mannitol and was thus not taken into consideration. Since all samples containing mannitol had acceptable water content, no further attempts were made to reduce the water content.",

The ratio had a small negative effect on the particle size, as the particle size decreased when the amount of NPs in the feed formulation was increased.

Since the cyclone used for product recovery relies on centrifugal forces for collection of the final product, larger particles will have a higher recovery rate. As it has already been shown that increased concentrations lead to larger MMAD, the observation that increasing concentrations increase the yield corresponds well with this. The finding that increasing the ratio provides lower yields also corresponds with this, since the increased ratio has been shown to decrease the MMAD. Besides providing the optimal formulation, the experimental setup for determination of the optimal factors proved that the fixed spray drying parameters were suitable for the formulation of nanocomposite microparticles with a size range applicable for inhalation, since almost all samples were of the appropriate size and with moderate water content. Thus, based on the results of the statistical evaluation a high concentration and a low ratio combined with mannitol as excipient were chosen for further studies.",

This effect is not seen from the values measured in this study. Particles containing mannitol in this study have very low water content, and this may be the reason for the different results, since the particle aggregation will be significantly reduced. The analysis method in this study differs from the method used for measuring the respirable fraction in the study by Bosquillon et al. [20], where the methods of tap density and electrical zone sensing on spray-dried powders suspended in saline was combined to provide an aerodynamic diameter. The aerodynamic behaviour was investigated using an Andersen cascade impactor. The difference in analysis methods could also explain the difference in results, but it is very likely that the low moisture content seen in this study provides a significant reduction in particle aggregation leading to the different conclusions. The redispersibility of non-loaded NPs from the spray-dried powders were successfully demonstrated for the developed method of spray drying for each of the three different excipients, and it is highly likely that the results for siRNA-loaded NPs spray dried with mannitol will also apply for nanocomposite particles with the remaining two excipients.",

Some degree of surface corrugation has been shown to be beneficial for particles intended for inhalation, and it is suggested that the improved aerosolization properties of corrugated particles is not only due to the lower aerodynamic particle size but also to a reduction in interparticulate cohesion [31], [32]. Surface corrugation has also been reported to reduce the influence of the inhaler device on the aerosol generation [32]. Even a small degree of corrugation is sufficient to obtain the described effects [31]. Corrugated particles might also be more appropriate for dissolution in the lung fluid due to a larger surface area. This could be an advantage in the case of the nanocomposite microparticles since the rapid release of the NPs into the lung fluid is necessary to avoid macrophage clearance. The discovered possibility of modifications of the surface corrugation in the nanocomposite microparticles represents an interesting possibility for further optimisation of the system for delivery by inhalation. In addition, since the siRNA-containing NPs were produced by a modified version of the double emulsion solvent evaporation method, the size of the NPs can easily be modified to provide smaller particles by making small changes to the production method. Smaller NPs could possibly minimize loss by macrophage clearance of released NPs following inhalation [10], [11].",

The siRNA extracted from the microparticles was shown to be of the same size as before spray drying when analysed by PAGE. To ensure that the biological activity of the siRNA was preserved, two cell transfection studies were performed. The first study showed that the biological activity of the siRNA was retained after spray drying by evaluating the gene silencing effect of siRNA extracted from NPs combined with the commercial transfection reagent lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 5A). The second study evaluated the silencing efficiency of the NPs before and after spray drying and with or without the addition of lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 5B). The NPs displayed a good gene silencing efficiency in combination with lipofectamine 2000. However, there was no observable effect with the NPs without lipofectamine. Preliminary results indicate that the lack of silencing activity for the NPs alone might be due to a very slow siRNA release, which can be accelerated in the presence of lipofectamine 2000, resulting in the release of a dose sufficient for gene silencing within the 48 h of the in vitro experiment. No cellular toxicity was observed upon addition of lipofectamine 2000. In addition, the NPs seem to be capable of endosomal escape, which would therefore not be the cause of the lack of silencing in this short-term cell study. We are currently testing the effect of modified PLGA matrixes on the release profile and the gene knock-down efficiency of the siRNA-loaded NPs. Such modifications should ideally not compromise the favourable safety profile of the polymer, and still enable the preparation of nanocomposite microparticles with optimal characteristics for inhalation therapy.",

            "text": "A method has been optimised for the spray drying of nanocomposite microparticles consisting of mannitol and PLGA NPs containing siRNA. The NPs used for spray drying were easily redispersed when the nanocomposite microparticles were dissolved in water. The siRNA encapsulated inside the NPs could be extracted and successfully used for gene knockdown in a cell transfection study using a commercial transfection agent. Also, the NPs showed a significant knockdown when mixed with lipofectamine 2000, probably due to a change of the release profile making the silencing measurable in a short term in vitro study. The ratio of NPs to excipient was found to have a significant effect on the surface morphology of the spray-dried nanocomposite microparticles. This discovery could provide the basis for further optimisation of the nanocomposite microparticles with respect to aerosolization properties. This study has proven for the first time that it is possible to obtain a spray-dried formulation containing siRNA with characteristics known to be optimal for inhalation therapy, without compromising the activity of the siRNA. Future work will address the preparation and in vivo test of this type of nanocomposite microparticles.",
