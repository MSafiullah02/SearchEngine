            "text": "In many ways, journalism about bioterrorism is little more than a special case of journalism about science. Even when a bioterrorism story involves some broad public policy issue, the subject invariably rests on a substrate of science and technical knowledge. Consequently, understanding policy issues involving bioterrorism -to mention nothing of terrorist events themselves -requires knowledge of biological mechanisms, an appreciation of clinical decision-making in medicine, and a sense of how to conceptualize and evaluate relative risks. Many science reporters are conversant with these subjects, but some aren't. In any case, many stories on bioterrorism are written, produced and edited by journalists unfamiliar, and often uncomfortable, with scientific subjects. Scientists and policy-makers should keep this in mind at all times. Like it or not, they need to realize that to make themselves clear they may have to conduct a running seminar on scientific methods, concepts and reasoning. It goes -almost but not quite without saying -that the sources of information need to be conversant in those areas themselves.",

Political, constitutional and national security crises may be well-served by the voice of authority, the reassuring (or beguiling) power of rhetoric, and even by the ability to deftly make a weak argument. But scientific crises -which are almost always health crises at some level -require expertise, first and above all. Opinion counts for little when evaluating hazards to life, or devising a response to them. Judgment and authority are useful tools only when wielded by people who know what they are talking about. This is a very hard lesson for policy makers to learn. But it is the first one they must if they want to increase the chance that the news media will do a good job.",

This was a level of attention equal to that seen after the events of September 11 that year. Fifty percent said the media was not exaggerating the danger of anthrax; 42% said it was [1] . In the 110 days after the first case, the Office of Communications at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the government agency coordinating the public health response to the attacks, conducted 23 press briefings and 306 television interviews, wrote 44 press releases, and took 7737 calls from the news media [2] . (Interestingly, 2\u00bd times as many calls came directly from the public -17,986 in all). The value of a well-informed and well-treated press in such times can scarcely be overstated.",

When this principle is invoked in scientific argumentation it is often called ''Occam's Razor'', after William of Occam (1285-1349), a medieval English theologian and logician. Occam (whose name is a Latinized spelling of Ockham, his birth village south of London) criticized what he considered the unwarrantedly complex (and therefore, he thought, likely to be false) writings of his contemporaries.

This idea is captured in two admonitions nearly every physician is told at least once during his training: ''common things are still common,'' and ''when you hear hoof beats, don't think of zebras.'' In sum, the natural impulse of physicians to resist acting on wild or untested ideas runs deep -so deep, in fact, that its power may not be fully appreciated by physicians themselves.",

When this pattern is symmetrical on either side of the mean (or average) value it is called a ''normal distribution.'' Normal distributions have specific mathematical properties; for one, the rarity of certain outcomes can be calculated. In that sense, the bell curve can be used to predict the likeliness of future events. Not all biological events have a normal distribution, but many do [5] .",

That's because bioterrorism is an unnatural event even if its components -viruses, toxins, organs, medicines -are each natural and at some level behaving in familiar ways. Bioterrorism creates interactions that do not occur on their own. It produces conditions of unpredictable risk; it makes vulnerable people who aren't normally vulnerable; it alters highly evolved mechanisms of transmission, distribution, and protection. The doomsday scenario of a crop-duster laying down a cloud of anthrax spores on Manhattan -an event modeled by inference, if not by name, in a recent journal article -falls entirely outside the natural history of anthrax spores, human beings and Manhattan [6] . It is safe to say that previous experience with anthrax outbreaks is not likely to be very helpful in predicting the outcome of such an event, or in planning for it. Unfortunately, it is hard even to predict how unhelpful the past is likely to be.",

            "text": "On the other hand, bioterrorism tends to magnify the importance of the bell curve as an informative idea. Because size of the dose, duration of exposure, mechanism of transmission, and numerous other variables are unknown and unnatural, physicians and public health officials can not easily estimate an individual's risk during a bioterror event. In particular, it is difficult to identify occupants of the left-hand tail of a bell curve that depicts exposure to a pathogen. It's hard to say with confidence who is at very low risk of becoming infected, so that tail tends to be ignored and its occupants mentally swept into the fat part of the curve for safety sake when it comes to decisions about clinical monitoring, prophylactic treatment and other interventions. However, the bell curve that represents the side effects of interventions presents a different story. The existence of the right-hand tail -occupied by the few people who suffer serious side effects of, say, a vaccination -is either tolerable or intolerable, depending on the probability of the threat being guarded against. If the threat is high, then people will tolerate side effects (or at least the risk of them). If the threat is low, they will find side effects burdensome or unacceptable. But if the magnitude of the threat is unknownis simply ''non-zero'' -then nobody can gauge whether the side effects experienced are worth the protection gained. This was the central conundrum posed by the federal government's recommendation of smallpox vaccination for certain hospital workers in 2003 [7] . It's useful for people who determine society's response to the threat of bioterrorism (or, needless to say, an actual act of it) to explain how the importance of different regions of the bell curve changes depending on circumstances.",

News is the noteworthy event. On any given day, this is more likely to be the odd and unusual event rather than the common and expected one. If dog-bites-man is the fat and uninteresting part of the human-canine interaction, then the two tails are where the news is: the cliche\u00b4d man-bites-dog in one tail, and the pack-of-dogs-maul-man in the other tail. In practical terms, this means that even if the balance of events is well explained, the press is always going to devote more attention to the unusual, the dramatic, the damaging.

Thompson, who at the time was U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and the titular leader of most of the federal government's civilian health workers, held a news briefing at the White House after learning of the first case. A 63-year-old man in Florida working as a photo editor at a tabloid newspaper was diagnosed with inhalational anthrax. He was described as an outdoorsman, and Thompson mentioned that ''we do know that he drank water out of a stream when he was traveling through North Carolina last week.'' Several further questions established the man's age, home town, and a few other details. The press conference ended this way: It's little surprise that some listeners left the briefing with the impression there was a reasonably good chance the Florida case was naturally acquired, and that drinking from a stream might have been the route of transmission. It seems quite unlikely that the medical experts believed the former even at this early stage. The latter was virtually impossible given that the patient had inhalational disease and no cases of gastrointestinal anthrax had ever been reported in the United States [11] . However, the reluctance on the part of Lillibridge to provide a fuller explanation that might have appeared to erode Thompson's authority -along with Fleischer's abrupt termination of the briefing -guaranteed that misleading information would be reported, and that it would be attributed to a high administration official.",

Outside the United States, the remark was noted in The Times (London), The Daily Telegraph (London), The Scottish Daily Record, Agence France Presse, and the Spanish-language news service EFE [12] . If people thought there was a good chance the Florida man acquired anthrax by drinking stream water, most were probably foreigners! This curious result may have occurred because Thompson made his statement at the White House, where foreign news outlets have correspondents but most American newspapers don't. However, it is possible some American reporters didn't mention the remark in their stories simply because they knew it made little sense. The Associated Press, for example, carried a story October 5 in which Jeffrey P. Koplan, director of the CDC, was paraphrased as saying ''the patient has no digestive symptoms that would indicate the anthrax came from drinking contaminated water [13] .'' Within a week, however, many newspapers -including such influential ones as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and USA Today -had discovered Thompson's statement about the stream. By then nobody found the stream-contagion theory credible, and there was no evidence Thompson's remark had done actual harm. Nevertheless, it was publicized widely. Reporters cited it as evidence in stories whose theme was the federal government's confusing and incompetent performance in communicating with the public [14] . Patricia Thomas, a science journalist commissioned by The Century Foundation to analyze the interaction between government agencies and the press during the outbreak, observed: ''As the crisis worsened and spread, Thompson never quite repaired the damage done by his off-the-cuff words about water [9] .'' Thompson [15] .'' Nevertheless, authority and candor (if that is, indeed, what it was) didn't trump credibility and expertise. While people in the Bush administration apparently believed there was value in having Thompson be the spokesman, he came to the event with little technical grasp of the issues -and demonstrated it immediately. As a main source of information, he was eventually moved aside in favor of various epidemiologists at the CDC, and Anthony S. Fauci, head of the National Institute of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. By then, however, considerable damage had been done in terms of public relations. The comment became one of the most memorable anecdotes of the entire outbreak. Worse, it became the pocketportable symbol of what many people considered -rightly or wrongly -to be the federal government's early mishandling of the crisis. A year later, Thompson's remark was still being cited, albeit indirectly, by a prominent medical journalist, Lawrence K. Altman of The New York Times, in an article criticizing the federal government's press relations on an entirely different mattersmallpox vaccination [16] .",

However, there were many other problems, which Thomas describes well in her monograph: ''Those who got in touch with a press officer were likely to be referred elsewhere. If they asked about field investigations they were advised to call local officials in Florida, New York, New Jersey, or Washington. (There, press officers in the field sometimes bounced inquiries back to the CDC in Atlanta.) Reporters who asked about the search for the perpetrators were told to contact the FBI, which released prepared statements about the investigation but was otherwise tight lipped. If reporters called to follow up on comments made by Secretary Thompson or to ask about policy issues, they were usually referred to the public affairs office at HHS. And, although they did not realize this was happening, many reporters then had to wait while their requests were vetted by HHS officials in Washington [9] .''",

Like anyone engaged in acts of construction, reporters are happy to have more building materials than they need. Authorities should not worry that too much information will confuse. In general, reporters will seek and use only the level of detail with which they are comfortable. Bad journalism is almost never the product of too many facts. The prominent science writer Laurie Garrett put it well: ''If you build it, we will come. If you have a valid information source that is readily available and easy to get to, with openness and facilitation, it will be used. Most reporters will not search for unreliable facts elsewhere [20] .''

The illness in the Florida man was initially declared an ''isolated case'' with ''no evidence of bioterrorism [10] .'' While indisputably true when uttered, these statements on the first day set a pattern of confident assertions overturned by events. In ensuing weeks, pronouncements that a letter containing anthrax spores had to be opened in order to release enough pathogen to cause inhalational anthrax [21] ; that postal workers were only at risk for cutaneous anthrax [21] ; and that ordinary citizens had nothing to fear from mail all turned out to be wrong [22] . The fact that each successive event inscribed a circle of risk with a wider radius (and with more people in it) did not help the credibility of the speakers or their agencies. A statement by Steven Wiersma, Florida's state epidemiologist, after the first victim died was notably different in tone and content from so much that followed: ''I don't want to give anyone the slightest inkling that we know what caused this [23] .'' Why did so many assertions turn out to be wrong? There's no certain answer. But my theory is that many smart and experienced people failed to anticipate events such as inhalational anthrax in postal workers and a nearly homebound woman because of an instinctive belief in parsimony. Those things simply seemed so unlikely -without precedent, actually -that planning for them was unnecessary, and perhaps even irresponsible given the likelihood of unintended consequences and morbidities.",

And that was our epidemiologic experience with the cases we had seen so far. That construct obviously changed markedly with the report of inhalation anthrax in mail workers in the Brentwood facility in Washington where mail was not opened in the places where these individuals were exposed, or seem to have been exposed, and where the disease that they contracted was not cutaneous anthrax, which takes less spores, and is obviously less threatening than inhalational anthrax, and in which the physical characteristics are different. But to get a aerosolization of anthrax requires both air currents flowing around, and some larger quantity of smaller-sized spores to be present, and not easily explained at all by unopened mail. And with that, our current construct on the risk includes, obviously, letters that are unopened as well as letters that are open, that have had, been tampered with or have been maliciously placed in the mail with anthrax spores.

That where you indicated that there is an inhalation case in the State Department that's been reported, I think we all think that that would be highly unlikely to virtually impossible to occur, just by cross-contamination, and as well, without having these letters in hand, but based on what we've seen in other sites, there are probably multiple mailings that have gone out, and, you know, there may be several places in the federal government that have been deemed targets for these letters to go to. So I guess my own personal working hypothesis would be that this is not crosscontamination. It just wouldn't be enough material, infectious material from crosscontamination to do that.

Although the route of exposure of a non-medical hospital employee in New York City was never found, it is likely to have been cross-contaminated mail, as no spores were cultured from her workplace or home. The anthrax source in the case of a nonagenarian woman in Connecticut also remained obscure, but as she rarely left her home and no gross contamination was found in it, the best inference is that she was infected by a cross-contaminated letter carrying a small number of bacterial spores.",

Because the press's only consistent specialty is political analysis, the divination of how events affect power. The journalist James Fallows has described this phenomenon: ''No one expects Cokie Roberts or other political correspondents to be experts on controlling terrorism, negotiating with the Syrians, or other specific measures on which Presidents make stands. But all issues are shoehorned into the area of expertise the most prominent correspondents do have: the struggle for one-upmanship among a handful of political leaders [25] .'' This insight is most relevant for the media's handling of matters of foreign or economic policy, but medicine and public health are not immune. The top officials of the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services noted this in their detailed account of the state's experience in the anthrax outbreak: ''As the situation continued, news reports focused on what decisions were made (e.g., the closing of a facility, use of antimicrobial agents) and how they were made. The media and public were interested in what the response to the event seemed to say about state decision making and readiness to address emergencies in general [26] .'' If a journalist doesn't really understand the medical, statistical, and biological substance of a disease outbreak, he can at least appear to be knowledgeable about the interaction of individuals and agencies, and how events are believed to be changing their power and image. Much of this coverage is unavoidable. Some of it is even justified and illuminating [27] . In general, though, the public is better served by reporting that tries to reveal the substance of complex events and decisions rather than interpret them. Public health agencies are better served by this approach as well.",

This is not necessarily done by opening meetings and conference calls to the press (although letting reporters occasionally witness such events is a good idea). What public health officers and policy-makers need to do is simply describe to journalists how decisions were made. They should not wait until the decisions prove to be right or wrong before they describe the thinking that went into them. They should do it in something close to real time (which regular briefings, such as the CDC's daily teleconferences, offered). Specifically, public health officials should review the choices they considered when facing a set of facts and uncertainties. They should describe what the arguments for each course of action were, directing reporters' attention to the evidence and logic that advocates for each position brought to bear. They should reveal, at least in general terms, the magnitude of disagreement and the steps that led to its resolution -if, in fact, resolution preceded decision.

There's a lot of talk about panic, and there's a general assumption that the public would panic in a bioterrorism event. My question is, where does the data come from to support that? In the events we studied, we were amazed to interview victims and health care workers who commented repeatedly on the absence of panic, complaints, or irrational behavior. Many emergency department workers said, ''Gee, I wish things worked this smoothly all the time.'' Most people talked about an eerie feeling of calm that came over people during life and death moments. Panic happens in disaster movies but typically not in real disasters for reasons that probably are based in evolution. What we witnessed is that ordinary citizens are amazingly capable of avoiding deadly harm.

Reporters considered this a rather imprecise answer to the question, and at some level it was. As cases of disease occurred without the recovery of infecting letters, the estimates were questioned widely in news stories, and offered as evidence of ''how little we know about anthrax.'' A Knight Ridder story of October 27, 2001 noted that an anthrax expert outside the government ''said that officials have overestimated the amount of anthrax necessary -a minimum of 8000 spores -to cause inhalation anthrax [31] .'' At the CDC teleconference of October 25, a reporter asked: ''Are you all doing any work in the labs perhaps with animals to test the assumption that perhaps with this particular form of anthrax it could take less than 8000 spores to cause inhalation disease?

But this is rarely, if ever, the case with infections, and certainly not with anthrax. The spore numbers are estimates of the number of the dose sufficient to infect 50% of the people exposed -the infectious dose 50%, or ID 50 . Half the people exposed to it won't become sick and possibly die, so it is far from being the minimum dose necessary to cause infection. Because there is no minimum dose, biologists use this mid-way dose as a measuring stick for the infectiousness of something.

For that matter, there's also an ID .1 -the dose that will infect 1 in a 1000 -and an ID .01 -the dose that will infect 1 in 10,000. So if it turns out that spores can get out of an envelope and stick to other envelopes, and if a fraction of those spores can become airborne again, and if there are a lot of envelopes moving around putting up spores in whatever tiny dose is the ID .01 -then it stands to reason that someone among the thousands of postal customers will get infected.

The media seeks to publicize the private and is reflexively suspicious of authority. Medicine values nuance and caveat in communication. The media relishes definitive statements and often cannot tolerate subtlety. Medicine generally attempts to reassure. The media often seeks to present facts in the most arresting and frightening context that can be defended with claims of technical accuracy. The hostility between the two worlds is sometimes profound. The twentiethcentury embodiment of medicine's ideals, William Osler, said with more than a little bitterness: ''Believe nothing that you see in the newspapers -they have done more to create dissatisfaction than all other agencies. If you see anything in them that you know is true, begin to doubt it at once [38] .''",

On ProMED-mail, the main public website for breaking news in infectious disease epidemiology, about 90% of the postings ''start with a raw newspaper article.'' In an analysis of 7 months of activity, 2.6% of outbreak reports from unofficial sources -mostly newspapers -turned out to be wrong. That compared favorably with a 1.7% rate of inaccurate reports from official health agencies [39] . As an independent and occasionally unruly force, the media also has an invaluable role in emergencies, including epidemics. This was noted by numerous observers during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In China, where control of the disease had consequences for the entire globe, the World Health Organization provided important assistance to local authorities, but ''it was the press that kept the focus on and led to the resolute responses that occurred,'' according to one Western observer [40] .",

In the past few weeks, this has meant getting facts out to the public rather than inventing ways to reassure the public. It has also involved acknowledging the seriousness of bioterrorism, but at the same time pointing out that thus far the morbidity and mortality associated with it are far surpassed by preventable illnesses like influenza and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Admitting when we do not yet have the answers has also been required. [41] They're likely to be the lessons learned next time, too.",
