However, each of those components is dynamic: the environment is changing, such as daily weather variation and climate change that may affect the agent and the opportunity for exposure; the agent is evolving during its life and interacting with other agents in changing environments; and the host is also dynamic, influencing the individual\u2019s exposure, susceptibility, and response to the pathogen and environment. Also, the vector is moving around and interacting with different agents in varying environments. Thus, most if not all biological, social, and psychological pathways, as well as their combined processes (e.g., bio-social, socio-biological, and psycho-social), are to different extents influenced by spatio-temporally varying environmental factors. Investigating how those components may meet in respective dynamic processes could increase our capacity of monitoring and forecasting the outbreaks and health impacts of infections.",

Natural environmental factors, such as precipitation, humidity, and temperature, have been recognized as important factors of infectious disease spread, such as hand-foot-and-mouth disease and influenza [3]. The populations who are exposed to certain environmental factors can lead to an increasing contact to infectious agents. In particular, the hysteresis effect of the weather factors should be considered [4]. Socioeconomic factors, such as population density, human movement, urbanization, economic development, and communication technology development, are also connected to the transmission of infectious diseases. For instance, modern transportations have accelerated the spread of dengue and mosquito vectors across the world over the last six decades; human movement and urbanization have increased the frequency of communication among individuals and thus the risk for HIV transmission [5]. In addition, environmental amenities could facilitate the formation of behaviors, such as outdoor physical activities, which could increase the contact between people, motivating the outbreak of human-to-human transmission of diseases.",

Some infectious diseases are more likely to happen in specific age and/or gender groups. For example, the hand-foot-mouth disease more likely attacks children under 10 years [6]. Furthermore, a compromised immune status resulting from poor nutritional status in infancy may directly lead to an increased risk for infections in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, as well as potentially elevated morbidity and mortality rates at each stage of life, especially in late adulthood. Additionally, long-term health impacts after infection may exist across the life course and across regions, such as the birth defects of children who are exposed to maternal Zika virus infection in America [7]. Infectious diseases caught in early childhood can also lead to malnutrition (e.g., stunting and overweight), which could still lead to higher risk for chronic diseases at a later stage of life.",

Spatial approaches have been increasingly used to study the determinants of and the risk for infections for two decades [11]. For example, the changing spatio-temporal distribution of variant virus strains (e.g., influenza A viruses), has high impacts on the risk for influenza infections in populations across the world [12]; phylogeographical methods hold great potential for understanding the epidemics, spread routes, as well as the changing risks from origins to destinations (e.g., Zika and seventh cholera pandemic), by combining geolocations and genetic data, etc. Although these researches, as well as some other themes such as early detection and warning of disease outbreaks, could be partly under the concept of life course, they mainly stay at the regional instead of individual level (e.g., focusing on what types of climatic and meteorological factors may be risk factors). Many individual-level factors could be confounders for the detected associations. This problem needs to be solved in a longitudinal study design, which, in turn, requires spatial technologies to provide temporally frequent measurements of external environmental factors to enrich cohort data and hence investigate causal relationships between environmental exposure and disease occurrence.",

Modern ways of collecting those data include using location-based services (e.g., smartphone or mHealth applications) to ease the survey process [13]. Therefore, survey questions on infectious diseases could be combined into the prospective cohort studies that have been mainly designed for studying chronic diseases. In turn, data collected in infectious disease surveys could also be used to supplement the local cohort studies. Furthermore, if there is a sufficient sample size, infectious disease surveillance, surveys, and reports (e.g., the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting) could all be used to construct study populations for spatial lifecourse epidemiologic research.",

Lifecourse analyses for infectious diseases from macro to micro levels are helpful to improve the accuracy of the dynamic transmission model, as they provide additional information for simulation of the progression of infectious diseases. Some dynamic models from a lifecourse perspective have been developed, such as climate-driven dynamic models, age-dependent dynamic models, and human mobility-based models [5,14]. Propagation dynamics models could be used to predict the changes of infectious populations during an epidemic, which divide a population into different groups, such as susceptible population, infected population, and recovery population [15]. Different groups of the population are interchanged by a proportion within a period. Two directions of improvements may be considered from a spatial lifecourse perspective. One is that a susceptible population could be estimated more accurately, according to the distribution of the population and corresponding infectious factors. The other is related to the adjustment of model parameters, such as transmission rate and recovery rate.",
