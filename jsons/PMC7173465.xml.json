            "text": "Astrovirus genomes are unsegmented positive-strand RNA; genomes are not capped but have a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. Genomes have three long overlapping reading frames (ORFs) that encode polyproteins (Fig. 14.2\n). There are short untranslated regions at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome. Similar to other positive-strand RNA viruses (for example togaviruses and coronaviruses), two ORFs covering the 5\u2032 half of the genome encode nonstructural proteins (NSPs) that include proteases, membrane-associated proteins, an NTP-binding protein, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORFs for NSPs are overlapping and synthesis of the longer polyprotein product likely requires a ribosomal frame-shift between ORF1a and ORF1b (Fig. 14.2). Astrovirus RNA is not capped, and based on the presence of a protein sequence similar to calicivirus VPg (in ORF1b), it is postulated that RNA synthesis is initiated using a protein primer. Astrovirus replication is cytoplasmic.",

            "text": "Astrovirus particles have T=3 icosahedral symmetry. The capsid protein is encoded from ORF2, expressed from a subgenomic mRNA. The capsid precursor undergoes multiple cleavages. The full-length precursor (VP90) is cleaved by cellular proteases (caspases) to generate the VP70 product. If capsase inhibitors are added to infected cells, release of virions is blocked. However VP70-containing capsids are likely noninfectious until VP70 is further processed by trypsin-like proteases to generate mature virions containing three polypeptides (VP25, VP27, and VP34). Addition of trypsin to cultured cells produces\ninfectious particles and similar enzymes are present in the intestine during a natural infection. The capsid core is formed by VP34 while VP25 and VP27 form the spikes on the virion surface. Binding sites for neutralizing antibodies map to VP25 and VP27.",

Astrovirus infection does not notably alter intestinal architecture and does not induce inflammation. It has been proposed that pathogenesis may be caused by apoptotic death of infected epithelial cells. Symptomatic infections are most common in children younger than 2 years of age, and it is estimated that 5%\u20139% of cases of viral diarrhea in young children are caused by astroviruses. In the US population the presence of antiastrovirus antibodies is very high, indicating that most infections are asymptomatic or very mild. Outbreaks of astrovirus-associated diarrhea have been reported among elderly patients and military recruits. Food-borne outbreaks, affecting thousands of individuals, have occurred in Japan. In temperate climates astrovirus infection is highest during winter months while in tropical regions prevalence is highest during the rainy season (Box 14.2\n).Box 14.2TaxonomyFamily Astroviridae\nGenus Avastrovirus (three numbered species from birds)Astrovirus 1 (turkey)Astrovirus 2 (chicken)Astrovirus 3 (duck)\nGenus Mamastrovirus (19 numbered species from mammals; note that many were identified by sequencing studies and have not been cultured)Mamastrovirus 1, 6, 8, 9 (humans and human stool)Mamastrovirus 2 (feline)Mamastrovirus 3 (porcine)Mamastroviruses 4, 11 (sea lion)Mamastrovirus 5 (canine stool)Mamastrovirus 7 (bottlenose dolphin)Mamastrovirus 10 (mink)Mamastroviruses 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (bat)Mamastrovirus 13 (sheep).\n",

They have been isolated from a few children with CNS disease although disease causation has not been confirmed. However, there is a good example of CNS-associated astrovirus infection in an animal model. Shaking mink syndrome is a neurologic disorder of farmed minks. Outbreaks have occurred in Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. Examination of diseased mink revealed brain lesions (nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis) and experimental infection of brain homogenates into healthy mink recapitulated the disease, a result highly suggestive of an infectious agent. Attempts to culture an infectious agent were unsuccessful but the agent was finally identified using metagenomics. Nucleic acids sequences were obtained from brain material of diseased and healthy mink. Comparisons revealed an astrovirus genome associated only with diseased mink. The CNS-associated astrovirus shares about 80% nucleotide identity with an enteric mink astrovirus.",
