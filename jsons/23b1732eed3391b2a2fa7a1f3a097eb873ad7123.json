The word liquorice essentially derives from Old Greek glykyrrhiza, glykys means \"sweet,\" and rhiza is \"root\" (Schulz et al. 1998 ). One of the main active ingredients is glycyrrhizin, which has a cortisone-like effect. Glycyrrhizin is also 50 times sweeter than sucrose (Brown 1995) . Liquorice has several names such as sweetwood, licorice, liquorice radix, reglisse (French), lakritzeholz (German), Gan Cao (Chinese), Meyan or Beyan (Turkish), and Solodka (Russian) (Mills and Bone 2000) . Licorice roots have been used worldwide as a medicine and flavor in industry for over 4000 years. Medicinal uses of licorice are recorded in texts such as Assyrian Herbal (2000 BC) and Ebers Papyrus (1600 BC) (Lucas 1976; Reid 2001) . Licorice is believed to have originated in Iraq. The most widely distributed species Glycyrrhiza glabra is found in Spain, Italy, Turkey, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the western part of China whereas Glycyrrhiza uralensis is distributed form Central Asia to Mongolia and China (Hayash et al. 2003) . Various species of licorice are currently grown on commercial scale in Spain, Italy, France, Greece, India, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Syria, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, and to a limited extent in England and the United States (Sokolov and Zamotayev 1985; Chevallier 1996) . disease, and arthritis (Saxena 2005) . In Chinese medicine, licorice is used to treat acne and pimples, nervous disorders such as hysteria, irritability, and epilepsy as well as reduce the toxic or drastic action of other herbs, and to harmonize herbal formulas (Zhu 1998) . In earlier studies Kong et al. (1984) showed that root extract of licorice was used to treat diarrhea in mice, whereas Hong et al. (1988) demonstrated strong diuretic activity of licorice in rats. Extract of G. glabra was used to treat emotional irritability in adults (Tsuda et al. 1986 ) and stress (Shirinyan et al. 1988) . Licorice extract was also used to treat eczema (Sheehan and Atherton 1992) , and allergic dermatitis (Sokolov and Zamotayev 1985) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 111, "text": "(Hoffman 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 112, "end": 131, "text": "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 243, "end": 262, "text": "(Schulz et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 404, "end": 416, "text": "(Brown 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 602, "end": 623, "text": "(Mills and Bone 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 835, "end": 847, "text": "(Lucas 1976;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 848, "end": 858, "text": "Reid 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1162, "text": "(Hayash et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1443, "text": "(Sokolov and Zamotayev 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1460, "text": "Chevallier 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1499, "text": "(Saxena 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1735, "text": "(Zhu 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1775, "text": "Kong et al.

The Phytochemical Constituents and Pharmacological Effects of Licorice: A Review triterpenoid saponins (glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhizic acid), which are the major characteristic constituents of liquorice, are responsible for the sweet taste. The main phenols include liquiritin, isoliquiritin, and coumarins including liqcoumarin and glabrocoumarone A and B. Pharmacological studies have confirmed that plant extracts and individual biologically active compounds exhibit a broad range of biological activities such as antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-ulcer, antitumor, antioxidant, antiallergic, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and dermatological activities. The Glycyrrhiza plant can also be used in the management of impaired learning, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. The potentially toxic compounds in licorice are unconfirmed, whereas the toxic effects of licorice plant are well documented.
