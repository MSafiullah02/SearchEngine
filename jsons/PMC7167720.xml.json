Recently, a distinct coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS 1, 2, 3, 4. The spike proteins of this RNA virus associate with cellular receptors of sensitive cells to mediate infection of their target cells, after which viral replication begins in the cytoplasm. The main targets of SARS\u2010CoV are the lungs, immune organs, and systemic small vessels, resulting in systemic vasculitis, decreased immune function, and respiratory distress caused by extensive pulmonary consolidation and diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation 5: the latter causes death in 10% of infected individuals 6.",

ACE2\u2010transfected 293T cells formed multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing S proteins. The virus was shown to replicate effectively in ACE2\u2010transfected, but not in mock\u2010transfected, 293T cells. ACE2 antibodies, but not ACE1 antibodies, blocked viral replication in Vero\u2010E6 cells 7. These data indicated convincingly that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS\u2010CoV.",

Additional tissue was obtained from unused donor organs; these organs were unused for technical reasons (often in cases of unilateral transplantation with lack of an adequate acceptor for the other lung). Extensive specification of the diagnosis is given for the lung and small intestine only (see below). Brain tissue was obtained from autopsies. Tissues were chosen to represent organ systems where the SARS virus has been detected in humans 13 and in experimentally infected macaques 3. Routine morphology was evaluated in haematoxylin and eosin\u2010stained sections by a qualified pathologist. Tissues were only used if characterized as non\u2010diseased.

A polyclonal rabbit anti\u2010ACE2 antiserum (Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA) 10 diluted in PBS and supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin was used at a concentration of 1 : 1000 for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected using sequential incubations with peroxidase\u2010labelled goat anti\u2010rabbit and peroxidase\u2010labelled rabbit anti\u2010goat antibodies (GARPO/RAGPO; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Human AB serum (1%) was added to the secondary antibodies. Peroxidase activity was developed by using 3,3\u2032\u2010diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB) for 10 min. Counterstaining was performed using Mayer's haematoxylin. Three types of control tests were performed to determine the specificity of the antibody. First, control sections were incubated with anti\u2010ACE2 antibody solutions which had been pre\u2010incubated with the synthetic peptide to which the antibody was raised (peptide sequence: NTNITEENVQNMNNAGDKW aa 51\u201369; Pepscan Systems BV, Lelystad, The Netherlands); second, sections were incubated with unrelated rabbit polyclonal antibodies (anti\u2010alpha 1 inhibitor 3 or anti\u2010nitrotyrosine); and third, sections were incubated with PBS without the primary antibodies.

The most remarkable finding is the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, ie cells in contact with the external environment. Furthermore, ACE2 is present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all of the organs studied. These data are consistent with previous findings that low levels of ACE2 mRNA are found in many tissues and that ACE2 mRNA is highly expressed in renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal tissues 8, 10, 12.",

ACE2 has recently been identified as the functional receptor for SARS\u2010CoV 7. Li et al showed that ACE2 can be immunoprecipitated by the S1 domain of the SARS\u2010CoV virus and that ACE2 can promote viral replication. The demonstration of ACE2 expression in human organs can potentially identify the possible routes of infection for SARS\u2010CoV, and possible routes of spread and replication throughout the body.",

Recent studies in an autopsy series using viral isolation, culture techniques, and in situ hybridization showed that SARS\u2010CoV is present in pneumocytes 13. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of coronavirus\u2010like particles and viral inclusion bodies in pneumocytes 5, 15, 16. We found that type I and type II pneumocytes are markedly positive for ACE2 and that bronchial epithelial cells show only weak staining. The type II alveolar epithelial cell line A549 confirmed the presence of ACE2 protein in type II pneumocytes. These data, combined with the fact that ACE2 is the functional receptor for SARS\u2010CoV, indicate that alveolar pneumocytes in the lung are a possible site of entrance for SARS\u2010CoV. Furthermore, this expression pattern provides a possible explanation for the pathological lung manifestations and their rapid progression. Initial viral entrance may cause cytopathological changes at the epithelial alveolo\u2010capillary interface, initially resulting in induction of type II alveolar cells as a first attempt at repair. In SARS, the abundant expression of ACE2 in type II alveolar cells may cause a base for rapid viral expansion and a vicious circle of local alveolar wall destruction, resulting in rapidly progressive severe diffuse alveolar damage.",

The upper respiratory tract symptoms cannot be explained by our findings, but patients with SARS might be susceptible to secondary infections 18.

Active viral replication in the enterocytes of the small intestine has been reported by Leung et al\n20 and SARS\u2010CoV RNA can be detected in patients' stool samples 16, 17, 20. We have shown that ACE2 protein is abundantly expressed in the brush border of enterocytes of all parts of the small intestine, including the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Surprisingly, other organs of the digestive tract, such as the stomach and colon, did not show this brush border staining. The presence of ACE2 as a functional receptor for SARS\u2010CoV and the presence of SARS\u2010CoV in enterocytes of the small intestine, combined with the fact that virus is present in patients' stool samples, are consistent with the possibility of faeco\u2010oral transmission.",

The absence, however, of SARS\u2010CoV in these organs, as shown by in situ hybridization studies 13, is at variance with this assumption. The vascular abnormalities and inflammatory changes in various organs might therefore be related to systemic toxic effects of the immune reactions elicited by SARS\u2010CoV infection.",
