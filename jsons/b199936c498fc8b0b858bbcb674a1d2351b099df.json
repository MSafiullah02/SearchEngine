Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable \"choke points\" for pharmacologic interactions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate patient outcomes. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce and iteratively refine a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung tissue. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and an online interactive model in under 12 hours, and community domain expertise is driving rapid refinements with a two-to-four week release cycle. In a sustained community effort, this consortium is integrating data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health.",

Age and comorbidities seem to be the main risk factors for development of severe disease [6] [7] [8] . However, the dynamics of virus replication, interaction with host immune responses, and spread within the respiratory tract are still being established. Because a vaccine may not be available for 9-18 months, there is a critical need to further understand the infection in order to quickly identify pharmacologic interventions and optimal therapeutic designs that work to lessen virus replication and disease severity.

Infected cells do this by secreting type I interferons (IFN-\u237a,\u03b2), which diffuse and bind to receptors on nearby cells to slow viral replication, activate an inflammatory response, and induce gene transcription 15 , to slow cycling or induce apoptosis in these cells 16 . Secreted IFN-\u03b1,\u03b2 are important activators and regulators of the innate and adaptive immune responses 16 . Many respiratory viruses, including influenza and SARS 17 , have evolved to inhibit or delay IFN activation 18 , and evidence is emerging that certain non-structural proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2 infected cells interfere with type 1 IFN by inhibiting IFN production and suppressing IFN signaling 17, 18 .",

Type I IFNs secreted by infected cells or by immune cells diffuse to surrounding cells and recruit innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, to the area. Recent studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 replicates more efficiently in pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages, but that type 1 IFN secretion is blunted in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells 27 . In COVID-19 patients, decreased numbers of T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and, to a lesser extent, B cells occur, and the extent of T cell depletion has been correlated with disease severity 2,3,28 . Excessive IFN-\u237a,\u03b2 activation results in increased macrophage and neutrophil presence, which correlates with lung dysfunction 29, 30 . Delayed IFN-\u237a,\u03b2 production also promotes inflammatory macrophage recruitment that contributes to vascular leakage and impaired T-cell function 25, 26 . Activated macrophages also produce other proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u237a, among others, that enhance infiltration of immune cells and interact with endothelial cells to cause vasodilation 31 . The excess production of IL-1 and IL-6 may be related to several viral proteins shown to directly activate the inflammasome pathway, the innate immune response responsible for IL- 1\u03b2 secretion [32] [33] [34] . Moreover, epithelial tissue death can reduce tissue integrity, contributing to further immune infiltration, fluid leakage and edema, and acute respiratory distress [35] [36] [37] .",

In particular, chemokines are released following viral infection, which leads to the invasion of neutrophils and macrophages and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). IL-6 levels have been associated with more severe disease as patients who required ventilation exhibited higher circulating IL-6 levels, as reported by studies from Germany and China [49] [50] [51] . In addition, replication in the lower airways and exposure of endothelial cells may further amplify the inflammatory response 38 . Collectively, this leads to extensive tissue damage and depletion of epithelial cells, which may be connected to lethality 52 . Within the alveolar tissue, and systemically, the feedback between viral load, adaptive and innate immune response and tissue damage is clearly a complex system. By utilizing a multi-scale framework to implement these interactions, we aim to connect circulating biomarkers, putative treatments, and clinically observed disease progression to pathophysiological changes at the cell and tissue level.",

Randomized controlled interventional trials in general or specific populations will be of particular value to test and refine the model. As of March 30 2020, there were 119 trials registered at clinicaltrial.gov under the search term \"COVID-19+Drug\". Within this 119, there are multiple interventions at different points of the pathophysiology, including, but not limited to: broad acting antivirals (e.g., remdesivir), hyperimmune plasma, IL-6 antibody (e.g. Tocilizumab), protease inhibitors (e.g. Lopinavir/ritonavir), chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and Janus kinase inhibitors (e.g. Baricitinib). As this platform develops, we anticipate predicting the responses to such therapies and refining the model with emerging data such that the range of clinical responses are captured with adequate fidelity. In addition, data collected from patients or animals during infection, including the presence of various immune cell subsets in lung tissue and systemic markers of inflammation, will serve to differentiate responses to SARS-CoV-2. These data will be similarly integrated to calibrate and validate the model to ensure accurate predictions of therapeutic outcomes based on clinical characteristics.",

This basic model has been shown to capture dynamics of both acute and chronic infection 75 , and has been extended to also include multiple viral (potentially resistant) strains 71 and various aspects of host immune responses 76, 77 . While such cell population-level models ODE models generally do not account for single-cell effects, they are effective for detailing viral load, host immune response, and pathology dynamics [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . Moreover, they can often be used to constrain and estimate parameters for more detailed models, develop novel hypotheses, and design confirmatory experiments 84, 85 .",

Many of these models are based on the IIRABM 116 , which is an abstract representation and simulation of the human inflammatory signaling network response to injury; the model has been calibrated such that it reproduces the general clinical trajectories seen in sepsis. The IIRABM operates by simulating multiple cell types and their interactions, including endothelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, TH0, TH1, and TH2 cells and their associated precursor cells. The simulated system dies when total damage (defined as aggregate endothelial cell damage) exceeds 80%; this threshold represents the ability of current medical technologies to keep patients alive (i.e., through organ support machines) in conditions that previously would have been lethal.

While we recognize that CD4-helper activity is known to assist the generation of CD8s, at the outset of this project we will attempt to see how well we can reproduce our clinically-acquired data without having to explicitly represent CD-4-helper function. If we are unable to satisfactorily map CIABM behavior to our experimental/clinical data, we will then add these components.",

However, if we don't take deliberate efforts to formally facilitate this intersection across our research communities, we risk producing a series of disparate individual efforts, limited in interoperability, transparency, reproducibility and scalability. The EMEWS (extreme model exploration with Swift) framework 118 was developed to directly address this issue and to provide a broadly applicable cyberinfrastructure to lower the barriers for utilization of advanced, large-scale model exploration on HPC resources. The EMEWS paradigm allows for the direct exploitation of cutting edge statistical and machine learning algorithms that make up the vibrant ecosystem of free and open source libraries that are continually added to and updated as research frontiers are expanded, all while controlling simulation workflows that can be run anywhere from desktops to campus clusters and to the largest HPC resources.",

Over time, the virion is uncoated to create functionalized RNA, which is synthesized to viral proteins and assembled to functional virus. The graphical output shows this center cell turning to a bright yellow as assembled virions accumulate. By enabling the substrate plot, we can see the diffusive field of virions first has zero concentration (no virions have been released), but as the first cell's viral production increases, it releases virus particles that begin diffusing into the domain. See Figure 4 (A). Over time, neighboring cells also become infected. They, too progress towards a higher viral load (increasingly bright shades of yellow). The infection propagates outward from the initially infected cell into the remaining tissue. As each cell's viral load (here measured as number of assembled virions) increases, the viral response model calculates the increasing effect e, and cells have greater probability of apoptosis. Cells nearest to the initial site of infection apoptose earliest. As these cells degrade, they are removed from the simulation, leading to the creation of a degraded, cell-free region near the center of the tissue. This degraded region spreads outwards from the initial site of infection over time.",

More importantly, it showed that for viruses that rapidly create and exocytose new virions, release of additional assembled virions at the time of cell death does not significantly speed the spread of infection. Moreover, decreasing the cell tolerance to viral load does not drastically change the rate at which the infection spreads, but it does accelerate the rate of tissue damage and loss, which could potentially trigger edema and ARDS earlier. This suggests that working to slow apoptosis may help preserve tissue integrity and delay adverse severe respiratory responses. That such a simple model could already point to actionable hypotheses for experimental and clinical investigations points to the value of rapid model iteration and investigation, rather than waiting for a \"perfect\" model that incorporates all processes with mechanistic molecular-scale detail.",

Through what mechanisms do certain patient characteristics, pre-existing conditions, or background medications increase the likelihood of adverse outcomes? 9. What interventions could accelerate building immunity? 10. What interventions can reduce or reverse adverse immune reactions? 11. At what stage is a given intervention most beneficial? 12. How does viral mutagenicity affect the robustness of a therapy or a therapeutic protocol? 13. How does cellular heterogeneity affect infection dynamics? 14. How does the nearby tissue environment, such as the mucus layer, affect infection dynamics? 15. How does the infection spread from its initial locus of infection to other tissues (in particular from upper respiratory to lungs)? How does stochasticity impact these dynamics? 16. How do tissues recover after clearance of local infection? Can scarring be minimized to reduce long-term adverse effects in recovered patients? 17. How do adverse effects in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelia differ (mechanistically) from other infections and other modes of epithelial dysfunction?",
