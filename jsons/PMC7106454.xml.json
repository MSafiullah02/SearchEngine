            "text": "Lung transplantation is the last treatment option for advanced stage lung disease. Despite advances in immunosuppressive regimens and management after transplantation, infections and rejection remain significant complications in lung transplant recipients (LTR). Compared with other solid organ transplant recipients, LTR are more vulnerable to infections. This is related to intensive immunosuppressive treatments as well as to exposure of the allograft to environmental agents [1]. Thus, both opportunistic (OI) and community-acquired (CAI) infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in LTR. In addition, the role of viral infections in favoring the occurrence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction has been suggested [2], [3]. Therefore, early detection and appropriate treatment of infections is mandatory to improve the outcome in these patients. While microbial diagnostic techniques have been developed and/or improved over the years, markers of immunological recovery predicting the risk of infection after transplantation are still not routinely applied during the follow-up period.",

Additionally, it has been shown that a low nadir CD4 T-cell count predicts limited immune reconstitution [9], [10] and poor CD4 T-cell recovery [11] in HIV-1-infected patients who were receiving antiretroviral therapy. Recently, we have shown that patients developing OI after heart transplantation had low nadir CD4 T-cell counts, while low CD8 T-cell counts were associated with the risk of OI following kidney transplantation [12]. Similarly, a more recent study confirmed that low T-cell counts at month 1 post-transplant predicts the subsequent occurrence of OI after kidney transplantation [13]. However, limited data are available in LTR [14], [15].",

Infections were defined as the presence of viral DNA in blood or BAL samples, determined using quantitative real-time PCR [16], [19], [20], in the absence of symptoms. Viral syndrome and disease were defined according to established criteria, which included quantification of viral DNA in blood as well as body fluids or biopsies in the presence of symptoms [21]. In the CAI group were included infections that could be acquired in the community or during hospitalization (nosocomial infection) independently from the patient's immune status, which include in our study parvovirus B19, rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza A and B. Parvovirus B19, rhinovirus and coronavirus were quantified by real-time PCR as described [20], [22], [23]. Samples were tested for parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza A and B by direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) staining as described [24].

After lysis of red cells, the percentage of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes was determined using a Navios\u2122 Flow Cytometer System (Beckman Coulter). Absolute CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts (cells/\u03bcl) were calculated taking into account the total (WBC) and differential lymphocyte counts estimated by an automated hematology analyzer used in our institution\u2019s clinical laboratory. Measurements were performed in a total of 703 serial samples obtained during the first post-transplant year; the median number of samples per patient was 8 (range 3\u201316). Since in HIV-1-infected individuals [6] and heart transplant recipients [12] the risk of OI increases below the threshold CD4 T-cell count of circa 200 cells/\u03bcl, the LTR analyzed in this study were stratified in relation to an arbitrary CD4 T-cell count of 200 cells/\u03bcl (referred to as the nadir CD4 T-cell count).",

Another study evaluated the differences between lymphocyte subsets both in peripheral blood and BAL in 24 LTR [28]. While the percentage of CD4 T-cells decreased, CD8 T-cells increased in BAL compared with blood.

In keeping with a recent study [13], our data revealed that LTR receiving ATG tended to have lower CD4 T-cell counts than those that did not. However, CD4 as well as CD8 T-cell counts were dependent on the nadir CD4 T-cell count. Some limitations of this single-center study deserve mention, particularly those associated with the retrospective nature of the data, such as the nonsystematic T-cell measurements and the relatively small number of observations. Although the study has limitations, our findings reveal an association between nadir CD4 T-cell count and incidence of infectious episodes in LTR, suggesting that, particularly in patients with low CD4 T-cell numbers, monitoring of infections should be intensified to improve early detection and treatment.",
