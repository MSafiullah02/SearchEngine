A standardized process exists for conducting respiratory outbreak testing in Ontario that involves coordinated efforts between Ontario's public health units, institutions, and Public Health Ontario Laboratories. When an institution or medical officer reports two or more cases of respiratory illness, an outbreak investigation may be initiated by a public health investigator and respiratory specimens are submitted to Public Health Ontario Laboratories for respiratory viral testing. Public Health Ontario Laboratories provides this outbreak testing for institutions such as daycares, special care facilities, long-term care facilities, hospitals, psychiatric, and correctional facilities. Nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens are tested for outbreak investigations based on Public Health Ontario Laboratories testing algorithm, which consists of real time reverse transcriptase polymerase reaction (rRT-PCR) for influenza A and B followed by subtyping of at least one specimen for influenza positive outbreaks. Multiplex respiratory viral PCR that targets a number of viruses including hMPV is also performed. Molecular testing was performed on the first six specimens submitted from each outbreak during the first 2 years of the study and the first four specimens during the final influenza season (November 2011 to February 2012). Commencing in November of each influenza season (defined as October 1 to April 30), an in-house influenza A and B PCR based on CDC protocols, and influenza subtyping based on CDC or in-house assays was performed [Duncan et al., 2011] A proportion of test-positive and test-negative specimens are stored for possible further laboratorybased surveillance. This study was exempt from University of Toronto's Ethic Review Board as left over anonymous specimens were analyzed further as part of a surveillance program that supports Ontario's Ministry of Health and long-term care. Detailed clinical information is not routinely provided to Public Health Ontario Laboratories, so was not available for the patients included in this study.",

RT-PCR amplification was conducted using primers targeting a 940 bp region of the G gene [Ludewick et al., 2005 ] and a 780 bp region of the F gene [van den Hoogen et al., 2004] . Amplicons were sequenced using the Big Dye v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the same primers used for amplification. Multiple sequence alignments of the Ontario hMPV strains and hMPV sequences accessed from GenBank for the G gene and F gene were performed by BioEdit (version 7.1.19). Reference sequences were downloaded from GenBank for the various subtypes (sublineages). Reference sequences for the F gene subtype A2b2 that was described recently were kindly provided by Dr. Michal Mandelboim; Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Israel (shown as HMPVG578 and HMPV S5335 in Fig. 2 ). Phylogenetic analysis for the F gene was done using the reference sequences as provided by Dr. Mandelboim which have been previously used to refer to A2b2 [Regev et al., 2012] . Phylogenetic analysis was performed by constructing neighbor-joining trees and each tree topology was statistically analyzed by bootstrapping (1,000 replicates) using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA 5.0) software [Tamura et al., 2011] . Sequences of hMPV isolates obtained from this study were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers (KC709690-KC709792, KC795605-KC795682 for G-gene and KC709690-KC709781 for F-gene sequences.).",

            "text": "This study shows the molecular epidemiology and the genetic variability of hMPV circulating in Ontario during February 2009-February 2012. The circulation pattern of hMPV is similar to previous reports, which document hMPV infections occurring throughout the year but peaking epidemiologically 1 or 2 months later than that observed for RSV as reported by Schildgen et al. [2011] and observed in this study during the 2009-2010 influenza season (Fig. 1) . Though both hMPV subgroups A and B were found in the hMPV outbreaks analyzed in Ontario, the prevalence of genotype A2b (56.8%) was high, as documented in other recent reports [Li et al., 2012; Velez Rueda et al., 2013] . In addition to these Phylogenetic sequence analysis was performed using representative sequences from different outbreaks and 100% identical sequences were removed. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were constructed using Clustal W and neighbour-joining algorithm running within MEGA 5.05 software. Tree topology was supported by bootstrap analysis with 1,000 pseudo-replicate datasets. Bootstrap values greater than 50 are shown at the branch nodes. Reference sequences are in bold text. Ontario strains have been numbered using the following format: ON-OB-YY-OBN-SS where ON \u00bc Ontario, OB \u00bc outbreak, YY \u00bc year of outbreak, OBN \u00bc representative number assigned to an outbreak and SS -representative specimen. Non-outbreak specimens have been referred simply as ON-YY-SS.",

These results suggest continuous monitoring of the molecular epidemiology of hMPV is needed. HMPV is difficult to grow in culture and is very fastidious [Boivin et al., 2007] ; hence the present outbreak testing method at Public Health Ontario Laboratories, using multiplex PCR, was found to be useful in identifying hMPV.",

The symptoms presented by hMPV are usually indistinguishable from common respiratory virus agents such as RSV, influenza and rhinovirus/enterovirus. There are presently no vaccines against hMPV and no treatment is available that is directed against this virus. Further studies dedicated to subtyping, viral evolution, phylodynamics, and how hMPV overcomes immunity selection will aid in developing more therapeutic and prophylactic treatments against hMPV. Further studies dedicated to correlating hMPV genotype and disease severity will enhance understanding of the epidemiology of this virus and may assist with outbreak management.",
