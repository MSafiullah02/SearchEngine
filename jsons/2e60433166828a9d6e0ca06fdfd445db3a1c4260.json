Historical examples reinforce this idea, as the only human infectious disease to be vanquished from the planet-smallpox-was one that was not contagious during the incubation period (Fraser et al. 2004) .

In congruity with this paradigm, host features and microbial pathogenicity are discussed together. For a microbe to cause a GCBR-level pandemic, it will be necessary for a significant proportion of the human population to be immunologically na\u00efve to the agent so that the microbe would have a high number of susceptible humans to infect. Additionally, large quantities of a sufficiently effective countermeasure (vaccine or antimicrobial agent) would not be available. Immunologic na\u00efvet\u00e9 would be expected with a zoonotic pathogen. The microbe, correspondingly, would have to possess the ability to evade the host immune response through virulence factors, immunological camouflage, or other features that allow a productive infection to ensue.",

A low but significant CFR adheres to the host density threshold theorem. According to this commonly held theorem, a microbe that kills too many of its hosts will run out of susceptible hosts and be extinguished (Cressler et al. 2016) . While this may be true of pathogens that are closely linked to one host species, it is not applicable to sapronotic diseases such as amebic encephalitis and cholera (in certain contexts), which can infect and kill without jeopardizing future transmission or survival. Indeed, many extinction-level amphibian infectious diseases are sapronotic in nature, such as the chytrid disease of salamanders and frogs (Fisher 2017) . Additionally, a GCBR-level event may not confer direct mortality. Reproductive effects (i.e., in the manner of rubella or Zika) or carcinogenic effects (e.g., HTLV-1) could, in many ways, be highly detrimental to the future of humanity, as they could lead to significant curtailment of lifespans and diminishing birth rates, which could ultimately result in significant population collapse (Rasmussen et al. 2017; Tagaya and Gallo 2017) .",

The explicit aim of these projects is to reduce the uncertainty of outbreaks by extensively cataloging as many viral species as possible, so that a virus that causes a disease is less likely to be truly unknown. At the meeting and interviews for this project, a number of experts expressed concern that, while efforts to catalog and broadly sequence viruses in the animal world would provide new scientific discovery, we should not expect that it will identify the source of the next pandemic or that it can change the work being done for pandemic preparedness. Broad viral sequencing would uncover many novel viruses. However, the vast majority of discovered viruses will not have the ability to infect humans let alone the prospect of widespread in the population. Only a few viruses possess this ability. This work should be pursued with the objective of fundamental viral scientific discovery, rather than the goal of near-term improvement in pandemic preparedness.",

Specific diagnosis (i.e., sending patient samples for definitive laboratory diagnosis) is often eschewed if it does not affect clinical management, is costly, and is not revealed with routine tests, and/or if the patient recovers. This practice has become enshrined not only in resource-poor areas in which access to diagnostic testing may be limited, but also in resource-rich areas, like North America and Western Europe, where specific diagnoses are viewed as superfluous. However, the yield from pursuing an etiologic diagnosis in infectious syndromes such as atypical pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis, meningitis, and clinically significant fevers of unknown origin may be considerable, as it will provide important insight into the ongoing torrent of threats posed by the microbial world. By causing an infection with enough severity to come to medical attention, the culpable microbes have already established that they are damage-causing pathogens to humans-a feat that only a sliver of the microbial world can accomplish (Woolhouse et al. 2016 ). Many of these microbial diagnoses cannot be made through the routinely ordered diagnostics. Therefore, a special effort would need to be made to get to a microbial diagnosis. If that were to be done more frequently and at a more strategic level around the world, it would provide an opportunity to develop new situational awareness regarding which microbes are circulating and infecting humans-information that is clinically valuable in its own right and more attuned to uncovering GCBR-level pathogens than broad viral cataloging.",

While RNA viruses pose the greatest risks, there are characteristics of other microbial classes that cause special concerns and are important to consider in scientific research agendas and in public health preparedness efforts. This analysis leads to a series of recommendations related to disease surveillance, antiviral and vaccine development, clinical research, and research oversight. Taken together, assessment of key microbial class characteristics plus the focused actions that follow this assessment can broadly help improve preparedness for pandemic and global catastrophic risks.",
