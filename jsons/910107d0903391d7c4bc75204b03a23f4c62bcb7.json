We hypothesized that nebulized magnesium would confer benefit without undue risk. Design and Methods: Patients aged 2 to 14 y with moderate and severe asthma (PRAM severity score !4) admitted to infirmary/observation unit care were randomized double-blind on admission to receive 800 mg nebulized magnesium or normal saline placebo after all received intensive therapy with combined nebulized albuterol-ipratropium and intravenous methylprednisolone.

Results: One hundred and ninety-one magnesium sulfates and 174 placebo patients met criteria for analysis. The groups were similar with mean baseline PRAM scores >7.

In children, intravenous magnesium is typically reserved as rescue treatment for severely ill patients. Nebulized magnesium therapy seems ineffective in adults with severe asthma. 6 In a recent placebocontrolled multicenter trial 7 of nebulized magnesium therapy in children with severe asthma, the investigators considered a reduced asthma severity score one hour after magnesium treatment statistically significant but clinical-ly insignificant, with no difference in time to discharge or rate of hospital admission. There continues to be speculation about asthmatic patients that nebulized magnesium might benefit. 2, 5, 7 Qatar's busiest Pediatric Emergency Centre (PEC) experienced 24,703 acute asthma visits during 2013, 9% of our total visits for the year. We escalate to infirmary (i.e., short-stay unit) admission for children failing to improve substantially with inhaled bronchodilator and oral steroid therapy (17% of PEC asthma visits in 2013) and transfer patients failing in the infirmary to the pediatric ICU (0.06% of PEC asthma visits in 2013), where they often require intubation. Nebulizing magnesium sulfate is inexpensive and were it proven therapeutic, could be readily generalizable to rich and poor communities alike worldwide for preventing a potential downhill clinical course during worrisome pediatric asthma patient presentations. Since moderate and severe asthma patients already have a prolonged length of stay, we tested nebulized magnesium added when therapy was initiated, rather than randomized as rescue therapy some time after bronchodilator and steroid therapy had been deemed to have failed.

If our point estimates for mean duration prior to readiness for discharge were hypothesized to reflect a significant benefit of an hour shortened stay (6.4% improvement) from the placebo mean of 15.6 hr, approximately 1400 patients per group would have been required to have 80% power to show that. If the non-significant 14% improvement determined from accelerated failure time analysis were true, somewhat fewer patients would have been required. In either case, a large number of patients would require an hour of nebulized magnesium sulfate treatment for modest clinical gain. Despite its theoretical attractions, lack of adverse effects, and though we cannot exclude the possibility of a beneficial effect in rare patients, our results militate against making nebulized magnesium sulfate available as part of the standard armamentarium for pediatric patients presenting to community emergency departments with moderate or severe asthma. Although a review of several much smaller studies of adults and children recommended focusing nebulized magnesium sulfate evaluation on severe rather than moderate asthmatics, 2 that conclusion was drawn from accumulating small patient numbers, including adults, subjected to dosing through suboptimal delivery systems without biochemical confirmation that magnesium sulfate had indeed been delivered to study patients. Two recent randomized studies seeking to study solely severe asthmatics, children 7 and adults, 6 found their effort frustrated and included moderate asthmatics, as we set out to do. Many severe asthmatics have already received steroid therapy as outpatients and greatest severity often becomes apparent during treatment rather than clearly perceived at presentation. We reasoned that the therapeutic population for an optimized clinical trial of nebulized magnesium sulfate should include children presenting with moderate asthma as well. Nebulized magnesium could be further studied as a rescue agent solely in severe asthmatics. our study was not intended to assess efficacy solely in severe asthmatics and was underpowered to do so.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Interpreting our results requires noting some study limitations. After randomization, all our patients were administered systemic steroid as well as 3 combined bronchodilator treatments (intensive therapy consistent with existing guidelines) 3 prior to nebulized investigational therapy, possibly diluting the proportion of patients remaining with moderate or severe asthma. An alternative design, studying nebulized magnesium solely as a rescue therapy after failure of bronchodilator and steroid therapy was unappealing because there is no uniform generalized definition of failure but it certainly would consume considerable time after presentation to have \"failed\", and our goal was to test for efficacy, safety, and proof of delivery a therapy that could be added early to moderate and severe asthmatics. Counterbalancing this possible concern is the clinical course of our study patients, whose mean infirmary stay duration before medical readiness for discharge was nonetheless prolonged, about 15 hr despite receipt of systemic steroid therapy, a treatment for moderate to severe asthma. It is also possible a substantially higher nebulized magnesium sulfate dose than we gave, or more than three doses of it, may have provided demonstrable benefit. Although the treated group had persistently elevated magnesium levels 3 hr after initiation of magnesium nebulization, we did not obtain pharmacokinetic measurements to allow a comparison with intravenous magnesium dosing. However, our nebulized dose of 800 mg was 77% higher than the 453 mg nebulized in a recent trial in children 7 ; it was 53% of the 1500 mg tested in adults. 6 Moreover, all but one of our patients was able to be discharged from infirmary care without ICU admission. We conclude that adding nebulized magnesium sulfate to combined nebulized bronchodilator and systemic steroid therapy is either very weakly or very rarely effective, or futile for benefitting pediatric patients with moderate or severe asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1590, "end": 1591, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1639, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Systematic review of magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma", "authors": [{"first": "B", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Rowe", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Bretzlaff", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Bourdon", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Bota", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Camargo", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2000, "venue": "Cochrane Database Syst Rev", "volume": "2", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Inhaled magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Powell", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Dwan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Milan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Beasley", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Hughes", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Knopp-Sihota", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Rowe", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "Cochrane Database Syst Rev", "volume": "12", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.
