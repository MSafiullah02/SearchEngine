SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was isolated and classified as Betacoronavirus, belonging to the lineage B or subgenus Sarbecovirus, which also includes the human SARS coronavirus.\n4\n, \n5\n The full virus genome of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has about an 89% nucleotide identity with bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45, the Spike protein has a 78% nucleotide identity with the human SARS coronavirus, and an 84% nucleotide identity with the bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45 coronavirus.\n6\n, \n7\n The SARS\u2010infected rhesus monkey model was once established,\n8\n and now the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected rhesus monkey model can dynamically understand the pathogenicity of COVID\u201019. A more comprehensive understanding of the pneumonia caused by the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is essential for developing more scientific and effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment measures. Meanwhile, the high fatality of aged cases caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was a need to explore the possible age\u2010related phenomena with non\u2010human primate models.\n9\n\n",

            "text": "We report nonhuman primate models for COVID\u201019 infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (HB\u201001). Three rhesus macaques (divided into younger group, YG) between 3 and 5 years old and two rhesus macaques (divided into elder group, EG) about 15 years old were inoculated with 1 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 through intratracheal route. Clinical signs including weight loss, fever, asthenia and lethality were recorded in Table 1, the weight was decreased obviously from 3 dpi in all the monkeys except one young monkey but without significant change of body temperature during the entire observation. Clinical signs were transient and lasted for a few days. Nasal, throat, and anal swabs were obtained from animals on 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 days post\u2010inoculation (dpi). Viral RNA was found in all animals from nose, pharynx, and crissum. Virus load in the respiratory tract peaked at 3 dpi in both of YG and EG (Figure 1A,B). For young monkeys, the virus load in anal swabs was lower than that in the nasal and throat specimens (Figure 1A). Moreover, viral load from the anal swabs in EG was persistently detected from 3 dpi to 11 dpi, which is higher that in YG (Figure 1B). One monkey from each group was euthanized and necropsied at 7 dpi. Different lobes of lung were collected for detecting the viral loads. Approximate 104 Viral RNA copies/mL from the upper lung was detected in YG. As shown in Figure 1C, viral replication in EG monkeys was detected in all the lobes of lung with higher viral RNA copies (range from 104 to 107.5 copies/mL). The anterior\u2010posterior thoracic x\u2010rays from the young macaque showed ground\u2010glass opacity and obscure lung markings in the upper lobe of the right lung at 7 dpi (Figure 2A). By comparison, old macaque developed obviously increased radiographic changes at 5 dpi, demonstrating prominent ground\u2010glass opacities in the bilateral lobes and left lower lobe of the lung, and patchy lesions in the bilateral upper lobe of the lung (Figure 2A).Consistent with the thoracic x\u2010rays results, microscopically, lesions were mainly in the lungs where interstitial pneumonia was remarkable. Pneumonia from young macaque was characterized by moderate thickening of alveolar septum, increased numbers of monocytes in the alveolar cavities, degeneration of epithelia and macrophage, and inflammatory cells infiltration including lymphocytes and monocytes (Figure 2B). Old macaque exhibited diffuse, severe pneumonia along with extremely thickened alveolar septum, serious infiltration of inflammatory cells in the alveolar interstitium. The alveolar cavities were filled with abundant exudation and fragments, accompanying with serious edema. Furthermore, viral antigen was detected from the lung of infected monkeys, and more viral antigens was found in elder animal than that from younger animal by immunohistochemistry (IHC), which was predominantly present in alveolar epithelia, macrophages in the alveolar cavities at 7 dpi (Figure 2C). White blood cell counts (Figure 3A), the counts and percentage of monocytes (Figure 3B) and lymphocytes (Figure 3B) were analyzed in blood samples collected along the indicated timeline. Comparisons between YG and EG revealed no changes in the counts or percentages white blood cells (Figure 3A) and monocytes (Figure 3B), a notably higher average counts or percentage of lymphocytes was observed in YG than that in EG during the observation, but the decreased counts of lymphocytes was found both in YG and EG monkeys (Figure 3C). Furthermore, regarding the counts of CD3+ CD8+ T cells and CD3+ CD4+ T cells, the obvious decline in YG but not in EG was observed in Figure 3D. Importantly, the decreased counts of lymphocytes were similar to the clinical manifestations of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected\u2010patients.\n10\n The specific IgG antibody against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from the two groups were detectable at 14 dpi (Table 1).",
