The nucleic acid test on February 12, 2020 for COVID-19 by Dazhou City CDC laboratory was positive. The patient had no fever, cough or difficulty in breathing. She was given oral lopinavir-ritonavir, which was discontinued after severe diarrhea occurred. She received no further antiviral treatment. On February 16, 2020, the patient had poor appetite and developed severe upper abdominal distension and her oxygen saturation was 80% and was transferred to our hospital by ambulance.",
