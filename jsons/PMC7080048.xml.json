These activities include meetings to present new WHO guidance and discuss their implementation, discuss new developments, and exchange good practice and training. MS participants are either formally nominated by the Ministries of Health (MoH) to represent their country or invited in their own right as experts, depending on the activity. In addition, WHO/Europe develops operational guidance (e.g., for the implementation of influenza surveillance and standards for laboratories), and through weekly bulletins and reports it collects, analyzes, and disseminates influenza surveillance data and data related to influenza vaccine policies and uptake that are reported by all 53 the MS. All key documents related to influenza are published in English and Russian and can be found on the WHO/Europe Influenza website [5].",

The mission team leader has an important role, exercising health diplomacy when liaising with the MoH to explain the work being done and when requesting certain actions from the ministry. One potentially sensitive area is the sharing of viruses with the WHOCC: obtaining agreement for their shipment requires knowledge of national regulations and procedures. Clinical specimens and viruses from the outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 in humans in Turkey and Azerbaijan were shared with the WHOCCRRI, facilitating in-depth analyses that informed further risk assessment of the outbreak and its implications for public health.",

On 25 April, nearly 2 years after the IHR came into force, the 2009 (H1N1) pandemic was the first event to be declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the Director-General of WHO, after consultation with an Emergency Committee and in accordance with IHR provisions. These events signaled the emergence of the 2009 pandemic. WHO continued to alert countries to the situation by the declaration of phases describing the global spread of the virus [33]. Phase 6 is the pandemic phase, declared when it is considered inevitable that the new virus has the potential to cause epidemics in every country. Summarized in Tab. 3 is a timeline showing the declaration by the WHO of the phases and the main recommendations provided by the WHO (a full timeline of events has been published by the WHO [34]).

A number of viruses from severe and fatal cases were further analyzed by the WHOCCRRI and it was established that there had been no changes to the virus strain that would alter its pathogenicity or antigenicity, the latter indicating that the pandemic vaccine should be effective. The mission team focused on providing recommendations for clinical management, infection control, surveillance, and communication for immediate implementation.
