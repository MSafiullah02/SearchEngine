            "text": "Effective antiviral drugs to prevent or treat influenza infections should at all times be available. Today, two classes of anti\u2010influenza virus drugs exist: the M2 proton channel blockers (i.e., the adamantane compounds, amantadine and rimantadine), and the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) (oseltamivir and zanamivir).13 The first two compounds have limited utility, since they are associated with neurological side effects, have no activity against influenza B virus, and the vast majority of circulating strains are adamantane\u2010resistant.13 A detailed description of their mode of action and resistance mechanisms will be given below. The obviously superior class of anti\u2010influenza virus drugs are the NAIs oseltamivir and zanamivir that are active against all influenza A and B viruses. These structural analogues of sialic acid bind to the catalytic pocket of the viral NA and inhibit its function in releasing the newly produced virus from the host cells.14, 15 There is a critical difference in the NA binding mode of oseltamivir compared to that of zanamivir, which explains their significantly different resistance profile. Due to its larger hydrophobic side chain, oseltamivir requires rotation of the noncatalytic Glu276 residue within NA to create a binding space for oseltamivir.16 By contrast, the smaller size of zanamivir enables direct binding of this compound to NA. In a mutant N1 NA containing a His to Tyr substitution at position 274, this rotation can no longer occur, rendering the NA resistant to oseltamivir binding. During the 2008\u20132009 season, oseltamivir\u2010resistant H1N1 viruses were isolated all over the globe, even from untreated patients.17, 18 In a Japanese study in 2004, nine out of 50 children treated with oseltamivir carried oseltamivir\u2010resistant H3N2 viruses.19 Fortunately, oseltamivir\u2010resistant viruses are still sensitive to zanamivir, for which resistance has only scarcely been reported.20, 21 On the other hand, the patient\u2010unfriendly administration route for zanamivir (i.e., by powder inhalation device) explains why oseltamivir (which is given by oral capsules) is generally preferred in the clinical setting. Inhalation of zanamivir is a priori excluded in patients suffering from severe influenza symptoms with acute respiratory distress, such as patients infected with the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus, or severe cases of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. To address this issue, an intravenous formulation of zanamivir is under consideration.22, 23 Besides, new NAIs are being developed. Peramivir, which has to be administered intravenously, has been licensed in Japan and South Korea, while, in the United States, its use was temporarily allowed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.24 Unfortunately, the widespread oseltamivir\u2010resistant H1N1 His274Tyr mutants show intermediate cross\u2010resistance to peramivir.25 Another NAI, laninamivir (CS\u20108958), was approved in Japan in 2010 and is currently in Phase III trials in the United States.26, 27 This promising compound requires only one single intranasal administration (based on its long half\u2010life), and has a similar NA binding mode and favorable resistance profile as zanamivir.28 Finally, novel NAIs with a sialic acid\u2010related or unrelated structure have been developed by rational design, but are still in the early experimental stage.29, 30, 31\n",

Its active ribose\u2010triphosphate metabolite is recognized by the influenza virus polymerase, causing competitive inhibition of viral RNA synthesis and/or lethal viral mutagenesis.32 T\u2010705 has broad anti\u2010RNA virus activity beyond influenza virus and is presumed (based on cell culture data) to have a high barrier for viral resistance.33 The second agent, DAS181, is currently in Phase II trials.

Two viral spike proteins protrude from the virion: the hemagglutinin (HA) and NA, which have a leading role in viral entry and release, respectively. The HA and NA glycoproteins are the main antigens against which the host immune response is raised.

Its membrane\u2010distal globular head domain contains the receptor binding site (RBS), whereas the HA stem structure (which contains the fusion peptide) is responsible for intraendosomal membrane fusion.34 In influenza virus\u2010infected cells, HA is first synthesized as its precursor protein HA0, which assembles into a noncovalently linked homotrimer38 and is cleaved into two polypeptides (HA1 and HA2 containing, in the case of H3, 328 and 221 amino acids, respectively), which remain covalently attached by a disulfide bond.39 For most HAs, HA0 cleavage occurs at a single arginine residue and is performed by a membrane\u2010bound or secreted serine protease that is restricted to bronchiolar epithelium, such as tryptase Clara, the human airway trypsin\u2010like protease or TMPRSS2.40, 41 The HAs from highly pathogenic avian viruses contain a series of basic residues at their cleavage site,42 allowing recognition by furin\u2010like intracellular proteases that are widely distributed in avian tissues, thus explaining their systemic spread and high virulence.43 Inhibition of the cellular proteases performing HA0 cleavage is an original antiviral strategy, and peptidomimetic furin inhibitors have proven to inhibit the replication of an avian influenza virus in cell culture.44 After HA0 cleavage, minor rearrangements lead to insertion of the fusion peptide (located at the N\u2010terminus of HA2) into a negatively charged cavity, thus priming the HA for pH\u2010dependent fusion.40 Posttranslational modifications of HA comprise the addition of acyl chains to the short cytoplasmic tail,45 and N\u2010glycosylation at several asparagine residues in the ectodomain.39 Besides masking the antigenic epitopes by sterically hindering antibody recognition,46, 47 the N\u2010linked glycans also function in the correct folding of HA in the endoplasmic reticulum,48, 49 modulation of receptor binding,50 controlling HA0 cleavage,51 and maintaining the HA in its metastable conformation required for fusion activity.52 The N\u2010glycans that are most conserved among various influenza HAs are located at the N\u2010terminus of HA0 (or after cleavage, HA1)48 and in the HA stem region.53\n",

            "text": "The first and natural types of binding inhibitors are the virus\u2010neutralizing antibodies raised during the course of an influenza virus infection. These neutralizing antibodies are predominantly directed toward the surface of the membrane\u2010distal globular head domain of HA.76 During the 1918 pandemic, some patients were treated with human blood products from recovering influenza patients.77 Eight controlled studies reported between 1918 and 1925 were recently reviewed, and it was concluded that the overall case\u2010fatality rate was reduced from 37% among control patients to 16% among treated patients. Treatment was most effective when initiated early (i.e., less than 4 days after pneumonia became apparent).77 These historical data demonstrate that passive immunization with anti\u2010HA antibodies can be considered in case a pandemic occurs. Obviously, safety considerations about the use of patient\u2010derived materials need to be addressed. An elegant method for the isolation of human antibodies was reported by Simmons et al.,78 who prepared H5N1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from the memory B\u2010cells of patients recovered from an H5N1 infection. Two monoclonal antibodies were effective in a mouse influenza model when administered no later than 72 hr after infection.78 An attractive new concept is the development of monoclonal antibodies that bind to the conserved RBS of HA and, hence, are endowed with heterosubtypic HA neutralizing activity. A first human monoclonal antibody directed against H1 HA, encoded CH65, was derived from plasma cells of a person immunized with the 2007 trivalent influenza vaccine. Cocrystallization of its Fab fragment with H1 HA revealed that this antibody acts as a sialic acid mimic since the tip of its heavy\u2010chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) inserts in the RBS of H1 HA (Fig. 2C).79 Since CH65 was shown to neutralize 31 out of 36 H1N1 isolates covering a period of more than 30 years, and to interact with the conserved RBS itself, resistance selection by CH65 may be expected to be rare, unless associated with reduced viral fitness.79, 80 It should however be noted that the RBS of HA is smaller than the interaction site of an antibody81 and, therefore, CH65 forms additional interactions with RBS surrounding residues that are less conserved among the different HAs. The more broadly acting monoclonal antibody C05 binds to H1, H2, H3, H9, and H12 HAs and was isolated from a phage\u2010display library constructed from bone marrow donated after seasonal influenza infection. Cocrystallization studies demonstrated that the HCDR3 part of C05 forms a loop that inserts into the conserved RBS of HA, while its HCDR1 region makes only minimal contact with RBS surrounding and more variable residues.82 A third cross\u2010reactive monoclonal antibody, S139/1, neutralizes H1, H2, H3, H13, and H16 virus strains.83 The HCDR2 region of S139/1 was shown to form multiple hydrophobic interactions within the RBS of H3 HA. The rather low affinity of this binding interaction is compensated in the bivalent IgG molecule, and this avidity effect is required to broaden the neutralizing activity of S139/1 to strains of the H1, H2, H13, and H16 subtypes.84 Regarding influenza B viruses, the human monoclonal antibodies 3A2 and 10C4, reactive against B viruses of the Yamagata lineage, recognize the 190\u2010helix (residues 190\u2013198 in HA1) near the RBS.85 The human monoclonal antibodies CR8033 and CR8071 were shown to neutralize both Yamagata and Victoria lineage B viruses and protect mice after challenge with a lethal dose of influenza virus.86 Although the therapeutic use of an anti\u2010influenza antibody may appear complicated, some parallel can be seen with the palivizumab antibody that is already in use for the prophylaxis of another respiratory virus, that is, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).87 An innovative strategy to improve the pharmacokinetics and reduce the production cost of therapeutic antibodies consists of single\u2010domain antibody fragments (also referred to as Nanobodies) derived from camelid immunoglobulins.88 A Nanobody directed to the globular head of H5 HA was shown to be effective in H5N1\u2010infected mice. The activity of the monovalent Nanobody was increased by a factor 60 when using a bivalent format, consisting of two paratope containing domains connected by a flexible linker.89\n",

The role of surfactant protein D (SP\u2010D) in the innate immune response to influenza virus is explained by its capacity to cause virus particle aggregation, thereby preventing virus attachment to the host cells.90 Besides, SP\u2010D has various immunological effects that account for its ability to limit lung inflammation by respiratory pathogens.91 Regarding potential antiviral use, design of modified forms of the porcine SP\u2010D lectin (which has higher anti\u2010influenza virus activity than its human counterpart) is aided by the growing insight into how its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) precisely interacts with the high\u2010mannose glycans attached near the RBS of HA.92, 93 In addition, N\u2010linked sialoglycans attached to the CRD of SP\u2010D are considered important, since they may cause additional interactions between the SP\u2010D and the HA RBS and enhance the antiviral effect.90 A similar action principle, that is, binding to high\u2010mannose carbohydrates on the viral HA, accounts for the anti\u2010influenza virus activity of the bovine serum lectin CL\u201043.94 Likewise, cyanovirin\u2010N, a lectin isolated from Escherichia coli, recognizes high\u2010mannose oligosaccharide structures on diverse viral glycoproteins, explaining its broad activity against unrelated viruses such as influenza virus and HIV.95 Cyanovirin\u2010N was shown to inhibit influenza virus replication in cell culture as well as mouse and ferret infection models.96, 97 Although SP\u2010D and cyanovirin\u2010N manifest broad anti\u2010influenza A and B virus activity, some virus strains (such as the A/PR/8/34 H1N1 strain) are known to be insensitive, due to the lack of particular Asn\u2010linked oligosaccharides on the head of their HA.98 The location and number of glycans attached to the head of HA is quite variable, since acquisition of epitope shielding oligosaccharides is part of the viral immune escape.46 In contrast, the glycans attached to the HA stem have a structural function in protein refolding, and the corresponding glycosylation sites are therefore more conserved.52, 53 This implies that antiviral use of lectin compounds directed toward HA head glycans might lead to escape mutants devoid of specific glycans, although the newly exposed antigenic sites might also render the mutated virus susceptible to immunological control.99\n",

After more than 30 passages in the presence of DAS181, influenza virus mutants were selected with low to moderate resistance to the compound (i.e., three\u2010 to 18\u2010fold increase in antiviral EC50 value). The resistant viruses showed an attenuated phenotype compared to the wild\u2010type virus, yet unchanged virulence in mice. When further passaged in the absence of compound, the viruses quickly regained the wild\u2010type sensitivity. Sequencing revealed that the resistant mutants contained substitutions in the HA near its RBS, as well as in the NA, leading to altered HA and NA functionality.114 The concern that desialylation of the airway epithelium might unmask certain cryptic receptors and increase the susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumonia, was contradicted by mouse experiments showing that DAS181 treatment does not lead to an increased incidence of secondary pneumonia.115 DAS181 requires topical delivery as an inhalant.

Activation of the M2 ion channel below pH 6 is caused by protonation of the third His37 residue in the M2 tetramer.142, 143 The protonated imidazole ring of His37 is involved in a cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction with the indole ring of Trp41.142 These two residues, His37 and Trp41, functioning as a pH sensor and gate, respectively, are critical for M2 proton channel function, and hence invariable among influenza A and B viruses.144, 145 Besides, Val27 forms a valve that controls the entrance of protons, while Asp44 is indirectly hydrogen bonded to the indole nitrogen of Trp41 via a water cluster at the exit of the channel. Thus, Asp44 and Val27 act as gatekeepers at opposite ends of the channel.146, 147 Comparison of the NMR and crystal structures of the A/M2 transmembrane domain obtained at neutral (pH 7.5\u20138), intermediate (pH 6.5), or acidic (pH 5) pH, provided a detailed insight into the low pH\u2010induced changes in A/M2 protein conformation.146, 147, 148 At neutral pH, the Val27 valve is open, whereas the Trp basket, formed by the Trp41 residues at the opposing end, has a small hydrophobic opening. When the pH is reduced, the Val27 valve constricts, while the Trp basket opens.147 Two mechanisms for proton transport through the aqueous pore of A/M2 have been proposed. In the wire model, protons are conducted via a continuous column of water molecules. Opening of the pore is achieved by electrostatic repulsion of the protonated His37 residues, which, according to this model, play only a passive role.142, 149 In contrast, in the shuttle model, His37 plays an active role in proton transport by protonation and deprotonation, which is facilitated by imidazole ring reorientations and small\u2010amplitude backbone fluctuations.150, 151\n",

In this way, binding of rimantadine could stabilize the closed state of the A/M2 tetramer.148 Finally, solid\u2010state NMR spectroscopy of A/M2 in phospholipid bilayers showed the existence of two amantadine binding sites: a high\u2010affinity site in the N\u2010terminal lumen, which is occupied by a single amantadine molecule, and a low\u2010affinity site at the C\u2010terminal protein surface, which only becomes occupied at higher amantadine concentrations.155 The presence of both binding sites was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, which further indicated that amantadine can bind inside the N\u2010terminal lumen under low\u2010 and high\u2010pH conditions.156 Importantly, the identification of the A/M2 binding sites for amantadine and rimantadine provided an explanation why both compounds lack activity against influenza B viruses. Compared to A/M2, the BM2 pore has two more serine residues, which probably disable binding of the hydrophobic adamantane moiety within the BM2 channel.149, 152 Also, the residues that make up the low\u2010affinity binding site for amantadine in A/M2 have uncorrelated counterparts in the BM2 protein.152\n",

By comparing the X\u2010ray crystallographic structures of the ectodomain portion of HA, obtained at either neutral or acidic pH, the following rearrangements were noted to occur at low pH: (i) the globular head domain containing the RBS detrimerizes; (ii) the N\u2010terminus of the central triple\u2010stranded coiled coil is extended by the interhelical chain and the short \u03b1\u2010helix, hereby releasing the fusion peptide from its buried position; and (iii) in the middle of the long \u03b1\u2010helix two turns undergo a helix\u2010to\u2010loop transition to form a 180\u00b0 reverse turn, positioning the fusion peptide and viral membrane anchor at the same end.55, 172 The actual membrane fusion proceeds through a hemifusion intermediate173 (Fig. 2D).

One of the first influenza virus fusion inhibitors to be reported was tert\u2010butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ; Fig. 6), which specifically inhibits H3 viruses.175 Several years later, the binding site of TBHQ within the H3 HA stem structure was identified by crystallization of the TBHQ\u2010HA complex, and was shown to lie within a hydrophobic pocket, formed at an interface between HA subunits.55 Besides several hydrophobic interactions, TBHQ is hydrogen bonded with the side chain carbonyl of Glu572 and the main chain carbonyl of Arg542 of one monomer, and the main chain carbonyl of Leu982 of another monomer, hereby stabilizing the nonfusogenic HA conformation.55 During the conformational change of HA, a critical role is played by the adjacent Lys582, located at the C\u2010terminus of the short \u03b1\u2010helix and involved in the loop\u2010to\u2010helix transition.55 The relevance of the hydrophobic pocket around Glu572 for the development of fusion inhibitors active against group 2 HAs was further confirmed by our studies with the novel anti\u2010influenza virus agent 4c (Fig. 6).176 Although 4c and TBHQ have very different chemical structures, we noticed a clear similarity between the HA binding mode of TBHQ and that predicted for the N\u2010(1\u2010thia\u20104\u2010azaspiro[4.5]decan\u20104\u2010yl)carboxamide part of 4c. However, the aromatic imidazo[2,1\u2010b]thiazole ring of 4c allows the formation of several additional hydrophobic interactions within this cavity. The inactivity of the two compounds against group 1 viruses can be explained by analysis of HA crystal structures, which revealed that residues 562\u2013582 in group 1 HAs form an extra turn, resulting in blockage of the TBHQ/4c binding site.55 Unfortunately, the antiviral activity of 4c is restricted to H3N2 viruses, since an H7N2 virus was shown to be insensitive, despite the fact that the H3 and H7 HAs belong to the same phylogenetic group 2. Also, resistance to 4c emerged within only three passages in cell culture.176 Conversely, several fusion inhibitors targeting group 1 HAs have been reported in the literature, that is, BMY\u201027709, CL\u2010385319, RO5464466, and stachyflin (see Fig. 6 for chemical structures), which inhibit the conformational change of H1 (and, when tested, H2) HA but, unfortunately, have no activity against H3 viruses.177, 178, 179, 180 Attempts to override this subtype dependency by synthesizing novel derivatives proved unsuccessful.181 Also, initial predictions of their HA binding pocket using in silico docking did not fully correlate with subsequent data obtained after cocrystallization of the compound with HA or photoaffinity labeling.55, 175, 177, 182 Whatever their virus specificity, these small molecule fusion inhibitors were all found to readily select for resistance, at least in cell culture. Two types of resistance mutations have been identified. The first are amino acid substitutions within the binding pocket, which affect the inhibitor binding to HA. Alternatively, the HA stabilizing effect of the inhibitors can be counteracted by HA mutations that elevate the fusion pH, meaning that the mutant HA acquires its fusogenic conformation at less acidic pH.55, 176\n",

This complexation would prevent the conformational changes in the viral glycoprotein required for membrane fusion.196, 198 At this time, a dual interaction of arbidol with membrane phospholipids and the influenza virus HA is merely speculative, but this mode of action would reconcile the biochemical and virological in vitro data outlined above.

C179 was proven to inhibit HA\u2010mediated fusion in a polykaryon assay in influenza virus\u2010infected cells,203 and was shown to be effective in H1N1\u2010 or H2N2\u2010infected mice.205 The first human antibodies to be identified were specific for either group 1 or group 2 HAs, and were obtained by systematic screening of a wide array of B\u2010cells from influenza\u2010vaccinated or influenza\u2010infected individuals, or by constructing combinatorial libraries. The antibodies F10 and CR6261 show broad neutralizing activity against group 1 HAs, and a partially overlapping binding pocket within the HA stem.206, 207, 208 Crystallization of F10 and CR6261 in complex with H1 or H5 HA revealed that a conserved hydrophobic tip on their HCDR2 region inserts into a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the short \u03b1\u2010helix in the HA stem, thereby allowing interactions of the antibody with the fusion peptide.206, 207 Another monoclonal antibody, encoded CR8020, interacts with H3 and H7 HAs, which belong to group 2. Cocrystallization of CR8020 with H3 HA identified its binding pocket lower down the HA stalk, thus in closer proximity to the viral membrane compared to CR6261.209 Stabilization of the HA prefusogenic conformation by CR6261 and CR8020 was corroborated by the finding that both antibodies prevented exposure of protease\u2010susceptible sites in HA when the virus was incubated at low pH.206, 209\n",

Further significant progress was made by Corti et al., who successfully isolated a pan\u2010influenza A neutralizing antibody that recognizes all group 1 and group 2 HAs, by interrogating a large number (about 100,000) of donor plasma cells.210 Cocrystallization of this FI6 antibody with an H1 or H3 HA protein revealed its interaction with a conserved epitope in the F (fusion) subdomain.210 Hence, binding of FI6 or the optimized FI6v3 antibody is assumed to increase the stability of the F subdomain, thus preventing the conformational change of HA that is required for membrane fusion. This mode of action accords with the inhibitory effect of FI6 on syncytium formation in HA\u2010positive cells. Alternatively, prevention of HA0 cleavage (at least for viruses requiring extracellular cleavage) or cross\u2010linking of HA subunits, have been implicated in the virus\u2010neutralizing activity of FI6. Passive immunization with FI6 was shown to confer prophylactic and therapeutic protection to influenza virus\u2010infected mice and ferrets.210 Recently, Dreyfus et al. isolated the human monoclonal antibody CR9114, which neutralizes influenza A and B viruses.86 CR9114 recognizes an epitope in the HA stem that is nearly identical to that of the group 1\u2010specific antibody CR6261. However, subtle conformational differences explain why the CR9114 antibody has a much broader anti\u2010HA reactivity.",

In order to localize the binding epitope for PN\u2010SIA28 in the HA stem, the authors selected escape mutants by repeated passaging of the virus in the presence of the antibody. Similar attempts to generate escape mutants with some of the other broad neutralizing antibodies suggest that viruses with mutations in the corresponding HA stem regions do not readily emerge in cell culture. For instance, with the CR6261 antibody, ten virus passages were required,208 while in other studies, no escape mutants were detected.212 These observations seem to indicate that the conserved HA stem epitopes targeted by these broad acting antibodies are less prone to mutations due to fitness constraints. This hypothesis, however, still remains to be verified by mutational analysis. It is clear that the discovery of these broad neutralizing anti\u2010HA stem antibodies offers entirely new perspectives for passive or active immunization against influenza A viruses. Also, peptides directed against the conserved epitopes in the HA stem region have been developed, such as the HB36 peptide that interacts with the CR6261\u2010binding epitope and recognizes several group 1 HAs (i.e., H1, H2, H5, and H6).213 The concept of a therapeutic peptide used to inhibit virus fusion is validated in the HIV field by the clinical use of enfuvirtide, a 36 amino acid peptide that binds to the HIV gp41 protein.214\n",
