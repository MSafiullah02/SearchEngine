In fact, for previous outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses, such transmission risk is documented. During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, 16.1% probable cases were attributable to household transmission [10]. Three generations of secondary infections, featured by a history of direct contacts, were also observed in the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea [11]. To this end, with the first 53 cases in Hong Kong, this study addresses four epidemiological aspects of COVID-19: (i) quantifying delay in isolating confirmed cases from symptom onset (thereafter denoted as \u2018containment delay\u2019); (ii) exploring factors associated with the containment delay; (iii) estimating the clinical-onset serial interval (thereafter denoted as \u2018serial interval\u2019); and (iv) estimating the secondary attack rate.",

Moreover, in Hong Kong the containment delay increased over time whereas it declined considerably in Singapore [25]. Factors affecting the containment delay in Hong Kong were found to be the source of infection (with shorter delays for imported cases than local ones) and the number of doctor consultations before isolation. The progressive increase of the containment delay appeared to reflect the varying transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Most early cases in Hong Kong were imported from other places in China, such that recent travel (in China) was initially considered a risk factor of infection. As the epidemic progressed and restrictions at the border were put in place, travel history could no longer be a criterion for diagnosis. The absence of rapid diagnostic tools, together with the non-specific symptoms of COVID-19, which can overlap with those of other respiratory illnesses that were occurring during the winter influenza season, jointly increased the difficulty to discern SARS-CoV-2 infections. This also explains the positive association between containment delay and the number of doctor consultations before isolation.",

This finding was in line with the results of work by Du and colleagues [26], who delineated that among reports of transmission between infector\u2013infectee, 12.6%  were due to pre-symptomatic transmission. The short serial interval, combined with pre-symptomatic transmission, containment delay (which fosters symptomatic transmission) and high secondary attack rate (which is almost double than that of SARS (6.3%) [32]) suggests that collective and drastic physical-distancing policies, such as limiting the size of people gatherings, issuing stay-at-home order, mass closure of public venues or even city lockdown may be needed to contain the COVID-19 epidemic.

            "text": "Third, tight infection control should be imposed on healthcare and long-term care facility settings. Pre-symptomatic transmission [34] and containment delay (as identified in the current study) eased the penetration of COVID-19 into long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in the United States. Elderly persons with comorbidities have been shown to be vulnerable to COVID-19 and to be likely to experience severe outcomes [35]. The identification in March 2020 of COVID-19 in 30 LTCFs in the United States [36] as well as the report of a considerable number of deaths in elderly homes in Italy [37] point to the potential for imminent outbreaks in these settings. Besides LTCFs, based on past experience from nosocomial outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses, such as the ones responsible for SARS in Hong Kong in 2003 [38] and MERS in South Korea in 2015 [11], attention should be paid to inpatients hospitalised for other illnesses than COVID-19, who might be in the pre-symptomatic stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, keeping alert to patients who might have symptoms not yet recognised as being due to COVID-19 may also be important. Kraemer et al. reported that from the onset of COVID-19, the time to confirmation (onset-to-confirmation time: 6.17 days) was longer than the time to hospitalisation (onset-to-hospitalisation time: 2.96 days) [22], suggesting that outbreaks of COVID-19 in hospitals were possible. In fact, among the first 53 cases in Hong Kong, there were three cases (cases 12, 17, and 29) hospitalised for illnesses other than COVID-19 who turned out to be confirmed cases of COVID-19 as well. In addition to LTCFs and hospitals, the positive association between number of doctor consultations and containment delay in our study pinpoints the exposure of outpatient settings to COVID-19. Therefore, guideline on patient flow management for outpatient settings would reduce the cross infections that can arise from their packed environments.",

The intrinsic epidemiological properties captured in this study can be of reference value to countries where drastic interventions have not yet been implemented.

Variability of the parameters, which govern the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, should be considered for future interpretation. From the results, it appears that pre-symptomatic transmission and containment delay, which in turn fosters symptomatic transmission, occurred during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Based on the results, control strategies were designed. Considering the non-specific symptoms of COVID-19 and the contagious nature of the responsible virus, sustainable physical distancing is recommended. ",
