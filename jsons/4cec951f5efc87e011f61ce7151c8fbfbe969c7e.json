The SARS-CoV-2 had significantly lower antibody epitope score compared with MERS-CoV (p < 0.0001; Fig. 1c ) and significantly higher antibody epitope score compared with SARS-CoV (p < 0.01; Fig. 1c ), indicating the spike proteins have significantly variable antigenicity. Next, we conducted sequence alignment to acquire the conserved and nonconserved regions of spike proteins ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). Compared with the conserved regions, the non-conserved regions had significantly higher antibody epitope score (Fig. 1e, f) , indicating the non-conserved regions of spike proteins are more antigenic.",

M Zheng and L Song ACE2 (Fig. 1p) . We discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was in the interaction interface with ACE2 (Fig. 1p) . In the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we found seven epitopes and only one of them was from the conserved region homologous to SARS-CoV, yet the rest are novel epitopes using the combinations of conserved and non-conserved regions (Fig. 1q) . Furthermore, we identified the high-score epitopes with both high epitope and surface accessibility score ( Fig. 1r and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Finally, we found 11 high-score epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 and only 1 of them was from the conserved region, but located outside RBD; nevertheless, we identified two novel high-score epitopes located in RBD (Fig. 1s) , which might be used to block the spike-ACE2 interaction to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our study showed that, although SARS-CoV-2 spike protein displayed high (75.5%) homology toward that of SARS-CoV, the novel epitopes contributed to 85.3% of all the antibody epitopes, 85.7% of the RBD antibody epitopes, and 90.9% of the high-score antibody epitopes in SARS-CoV-2, implying remarkable alterations in the antigenicity. Notably, these results might explain why the most of the antibodies against SRAS-CoV spike protein were invalidated for SARS-CoV-2 in the previous study 5 and indicate the necessity to develop new antibodies and vaccines specific for SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, we discovered novel and high-score antibody epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and analyzed their RBD locations, which should be potent and specific targets for developing antibody drugs and vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 in the future. Taken together, our study found that the antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is remarkably dominated and altered by novel antibody epitopes, which provides promising leads for the research and development of vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.
