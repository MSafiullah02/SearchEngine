In the same direction, we also found a clear association between tobacco exposure during pregnancy and lower expiratory flows, but only when infants were asymptomatic. A possible explanation for this finding may be that in our infants the marked reduction of forced expiratory flows during URTI may have obscured a potential effect of family asthma, perinatal tobacco and larger number of previous episodes of wheezing on the degree of decrease of lung function. Another explanation is that common respiratory viruses can directly induce important mucosal oedema by increasing vascular permeability, particularly during the initial stage of a URTI;28 in infants with RW it may be that the degree of such a response is unrelated to familiar predisposition or environmental exposures. Recently, it has been found that both, decreased lung function and enhanced bronchial responsiveness, were associated to atopic sensitisation of the infant rather than to family history of asthma or allergies.29\n",
