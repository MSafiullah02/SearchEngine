Soon thereafter, a wintertime prevalence of 5.2% in Queensland, Australia, was reported in children with acute respiratory tract infections [10]. In our study population, which consisted mainly of hospitalized patients, we were able to identify HBoV in 82 children, yielding a prevalence of 5.6% over a continuous 21-month period, with a peak prevalence as high as 14% in the spring and a virtual absence of activity during the summer months.

The most common reason for HBoV-infected children to be hospitalized was respiratory distress and hypoxia associated with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, supporting the concept that HBoV may directly infect the lower respiratory tract. Diagnostic testing of samples from the lower respiratory tract will be needed to confirm HBoV as a causative agent of lower respiratory tract infection.

Although coughing paroxysms have been linked to the presence of pertussis toxin in a rat model [11], the presence of paroxysms in Bordetella parapertussis, which does not contain toxin, raises questions about the etiology of such a cough in B. pertussis infection [12].

Although we did not test stool specimens for the presence HBoV, diarrhea in HBoV-patients is an intriguing finding, considering that canine parvovirus causes severe gastrointestinal infections in dogs [13], and some of the earliest members of the family Parvoviridae were identified in stool samples. Some controversy surrounds the clinical relevance of these initial findings, because the electron micrographic appearance of parvoviruses can be confused with that of other gastrointestinal pathogens, such as astrovirus [14], and the particles were also found in asymptomatic children [1]. Parvovirus B19 is not considered to be an intestinal pathogen, although 2 case reports have described diarrhea in patients with active infection [15, 16].",

The presence of HBoV DNA in children with respiratory infection does not prove causality, particularly because testing was often done in response to the presence of such symptoms. Likewise, because all of our samples were submitted for testing of ill children, the prevalence we report may not reflect the true prevalence in the community. To determine its true epidemiology, it will be important to determine the prevalence of HBoV infection among healthy children and the prevalence of antibody at different ages. In addition, the majority of our patients were admitted to the hospital, and because testing may have been performed only for children with more-severe illness, the severity of symptoms may have been exaggerated. Finally, although PCR is a powerful tool, there are potential problems associated with such high sensitivity. Small amounts of DNA from prolonged shedding following prior infection cannot be differentiated from DNA from active infection, and even small amounts of contamination within the laboratory can cause false-positive results. We reduced the chance that our results were false positives by using separate locations for processing and running samples and by confirming all initial positive results with a second PCR assay using a different genetic region.",

Finally, we propose that HBoV may occasionally manifest with gastrointestinal and dermatologic findings.",
