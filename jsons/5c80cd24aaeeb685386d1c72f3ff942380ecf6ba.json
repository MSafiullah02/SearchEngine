Patients with chronic diseases in unsupervised situation due to lockdown are not able to physically reach their healthcare providers. The resultant loss of control of diabetes and blood pressure may increase occurrence of COVID-19 as well as clearly increase severity of the disease. 1 In this context it is important to note that nationwide lockdown is likely to increase the burden of uncontrolled diabetes and its future complications as has been suggested by simulation model results for patients with diabetes in India. 2 Telemedicine provides us with useful opportunity to connect with patients with diabetes and other endocrine diseases. To help physicians who are engaged in diabetes care we have recently published practical telemedicine guidelines for physicians 3 . Although telemedicine has been used previously to manage diabetes, its use has majorly increased, and many telemedicine service providers are now available. The physician should choose the provider which has best safety features for data.",

Most of these consults have been for follow-up patients. Despite inability to do comprehensive clinical assessment including physical examination, majority of our patients have benefitted from advice on video consultation platforms. Encouraging management points include dose adjustment of anti-hyperglycaemic agents, demonstration of correct way to inject insulin, diagnosis of skin lesions (e.g. chicken pox), foot infections, and gangrene. An interesting important point is that many close relatives are available at this time at home, and these can join video consult, thus increasing important diseaserelated inputs as well.",
