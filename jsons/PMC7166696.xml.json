The inclusion criteria were as follows: age <18 years, received cancer treatment within the last three months, fever \u226538\u00b0C within the previous 72 hours, and having one or more of the following symptoms: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or respiratory distress. The following data were obtained from enrolled participants: age, sex, demographics, use of influenza vaccines and antivirals, date of onset of symptoms, and hospital admission and length of stay. Medical charts were reviewed to determine health complications, bacterial infection, and absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. Another chart review was performed one month after the initial febrile illness to monitor potential complications. The project was approved by the institutional review boards at the American University of Beirut and St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.

The higher rate of virus detection in our study population in Lebanon could be attributed to the use of real\u2010time PCR, the higher number of screened viruses, and including respiratory symptoms as an inclusion criterion. Some studies identified respiratory viruses via one or more of the following techniques: clinical symptoms and serology testing, virus culture, fluorescent antibody detection, and PCR for limited viral targets.2, 11, 18, 19, 28, 29 Nonetheless, even when compared with studies that utilized PCR as a diagnostic tool to screen a comparable number of viral targets (10 or more) in patients with cancer, this study has a higher incidence of virus detection.3, 17, 18, 19 This higher incidence of viral infection might be attributed to the cultural interaction that includes close contact, thus promoting transmission.30, 31\n",

For instance, children receiving chemotherapy developed life\u2010threating complications when infected with RSV.11, 35 Previous studies in patients with pediatric cancer reported that RSV can be associated with pneumonia and neutropenia leading to severe life\u2010threatening complications.11, 17, 35, 36 Mucositis was very common in patients with neutropenia, and this might be one of the predictive factors of the severity of respiratory viral infections, especially those because of RSV.11, 17, 37 The data showed that RSV was significantly associated with LRTI, fever, bronchiolitis, nasal congestion, and diarrhea but did not increase the risk of ICU admission. Similar to what was previously reported, the data suggests that encountering RSV infection in patients with pediatric cancer might add to their disease burden and affect their response to the treatment.35, 38, 39, 40 Moreover, this study revealed a high prevalence of RSV in coinfections and in repeated infections in patients with pediatric cancer, highlighting the urgent need for the development of RSV antivirals and vaccines. Currently, RSV vaccines under development are in phase III clinical trials, constituting a step in the right direction.41, 42, 43 In infants at high\u2010risk (preterm or having chronic illness), RSV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, including the FDA\u2010approved palivizumab, are effective for prophylaxis but remain very expensive in developing countries.44, 45, 46 The emergence of RSV variants that are resistant to palivizumab is a concern that highlights the need for more therapeutic options.47, 48 Prophylaxis should be utilized in patients with cancer, especially in those with the highest risk for infection (in this study, younger children), to reduce potential complications.",

RSV was the most common virus detected repeatedly in subsequent febrile episodes. It was not possible to rule out whether these infections were persistent or repeated infections because this study only included patients in whom a febrile episode developed rather than monitoring all patients on a routine basis. Hall et al35 reported prolonged RSV shedding that persisted for more than 20 days in some cases.35 Martin et al51 reported prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses in samples collected at least 7 days apart: the viruses involved in prolonged shedding included HMPV, RSV, AdV, HCoV, RhV, and PIV. A study by Soderman et al19 suggested that the shedding time of Flu, HMPV, RSV, and PIV is limited, and virus clearance was evident at a median follow\u2010up time of 28 days. In contrast, the same RhV genotypes were detected from subsequent follow\u2010up samples after 12 to 51 days, and some RhV\u2010positive patients reported the appearance of respiratory symptoms 6 days or more before fever onset, indicating the possibility of prolonged shedding. Longitudinal studies whereby patients are screened on a weekly basis until no detection of a given virus is confirmed are required to determine the frequency of repeated infections vs persistent infections among children with cancer and their impact on patient outcomes. A molecular approach using sequencing of the sequentially detected viruses should allow a better understanding of the extent of virus evolution in these patients.",
