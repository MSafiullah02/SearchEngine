Today the most basic defi nition is that viruses are composed of a genome and one or more proteins coating that genome. The virus genome is composed of either DNA or RNA. The genetic information for such a protein coat and other information required for replication are encoded in that genome. The HIV virus is a good example (human immunodefi ciency virus/structure). 1, 2 Virology is a work in progress. With much left to learn even about extensively studied viruses, we are also certain to be challenged by new, emerging viruses. 3, 4 At first, virologists focused on the essential interactions of viruses with cultured cells in which they are grown. However, the strategies of viruses are often focused on interactions with systems of the host animal, notably the immune system. Present and future research in virology involves unraveling the many details of the virus-host relationship. We are likely to be frustrated over and over by the subtlety of the mechanisms that have evolved both to replicate viruses and to defend against host responses. In some cases we will see new examples of viral mimicry of cellular functions. Meanwhile, intracellular locations of viral activities and associations of viral proteins and nucleic acids with cellular counterparts will continue to illuminate details of cellular organization and regulation. Animal models of many human viral diseases are still needed to help elucidate the paths of viral dissemination and specific interactions of certain cells or organs with viruses.",

The scientifi c literature is filled with numerous examples of the specifi c roles animals have played in viral research both in humans and animals. [5] [6] [7] [8] Animal models are essential for investigating and studying diseases in humans and that includes viral diseases. In the very early 1980s, when reports of a lethal immunodefi ciency disease began circulating, the news at first generated deep fears because no one knew what was causing the disease. The causative agent is a retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 9 In fact, the reverse transcriptase in the viral particle provides the signal that was used to isolate the virus for the first time. Tremendous advances in our understanding of HIV have been made through the use of animal models. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] While there are several examples of specific roles animals have played in research in virology, one of the best examples is the virus that causes AIDS. However, there are limitations inherent in many of the current models, whether they are nonhuman primates or other models such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). An exhausting review of the literature clearly shows that while there is no ideal model for HIV, the accumulating knowledge obtained from these models have made major contributions to understanding the pathogenesis of HIV. 14, 15 As stated by Robert Gallo, \"With animals, we may have a cure for AIDS, without animals we will never cure AIDS in my lifetime.\" 16 Scientists are also using a number of different animal models to obtain information that can have application to HIV. FIV, transgenic mice, and rats that contain part of the HIV genome or coreceptors for viral entry, and severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice reconstituted with human immune system cells or tissues are some of the animal models being used to study the pathogenesis of HIV. [17] [18] [19] Other examples of specific roles of animals in viral are the coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in which the ferret and domesticated cat are susceptible to infection by SARS. 20, 21 The scientific literature is filled with numerous examples of the specific roles animals have played in research in virology.

A pathfi nding exception was the work of John Enders and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School who, in 1949, adapted poliovirus to grow in cell culture. This achievement not only revolutionized the production of vaccines, but it set the path for the biochemical analysis of this and other viruses. Virology and immunologythose twins of offense and defense-are generally in a fi ne balance, but the story of HIV shows that the balance can be tipped against the immune system by a particularly cunning agent. Under the leadership of Dr. Robert Gallo, the Institute of Human Virology is dedicated to the discovery, research, treatment,and prevention of chronic viral diseases, including HIV/AIDS. 16 The study of viruses has historically provided and continues to provide the basis for much of our most fundamental understanding of modern biology, genetics, and medicine. Virology has had an impact on the study of biological marcromolecules, processes of cellular gene expression, mechanisms for generating genetic diversity, processes involved in the control of cell growth and development, aspects of molecular evolution, the mechanism of disease and response of the host to it, and the spread of disease in populations. In essence, viruses are collections of genetic information directed toward one end: their own replication. The viral genome contains the \"blueprints\" for virus replication enciphered in the genetic code, and must be decoded by the molecular machinery of the cell that it infects to gain this end. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites dependent on the metabolic and genetic functions of living cells. The replication and propagation of a given virus in a population are frequently (but not always) manifest with the occurrence of an infectious disease that spreads between individuals.",

There are also somewhat imperfect historical records of viral disease affecting human populations in classical and medieval times. While the recent campaign to eradicate smallpox has been successful and it no longer exists in the human population (owing to the effectiveness of vaccines against it, the genetic stability of the virus, and a well-orchestrated political and social effort to carry out the eradication), the disease periodically wreaked havoc and had profound effects on human history over thousands of years. Smallpox epidemics during the Middle Ages and later in Europe resulted in significant population losses as well as changes in the economic, religious, political, and social life of individuals. The effectiveness of vaccination strategies gradually led to the decline of the disease in other parts of the world until after World War II. Recently fears have arisen that the high virulence of the virus and its mode of spread might make it an attractive agent for bioterrorism. 24 Depending on the infection and the focus of study, other animals have proven to be useful in infectious disease research. These animals include the rabbit, rat, guinea pig, pig, dog, and monkey. The latter, in particular, has been utilized in the study of AIDS, as primates are the genetically closest relatives to humans. The advent of molecular techniques of genetic alteration has made the development of genetically tailored animal models possible. Thus, for example, mouse models exist in which the activity of certain genes has been curtailed. These are known as transgenic animals. The involvement of the gene product in the infectious process is possible on a scale not possible without the use of the animal. 25 ",

The gibbon and baboon develop clinical illness with nasal application of the virus, and the squirrel, cynomolgus, and rhesus monkeys develop illness when the virus is inoculated intratracheally. Primate models suffer from a number of disadvantages, including the limited availability of expensive animals. In addition, these animals are outbred and the models lack many of the reagents necessary to characterize the host response in detail. Mammals such as horses and pigs that are natural hosts for influenza have also been used experimentally.

Results suggest that the cotton rat may serve as a useful model for the study of influenza pathogenesis.

Genetic studies suggest that the Spanish influenza virus originally was derived from birds. Furthermore, the causative viruses from the 1957 and 1968 infl uenza pandemics were hybrids between human and avian infl uenza viruses.

Hantaviruses are maintained in various rodent reservoirs, in which the hosts are persistently infected without disease symptoms. Specifi c hantaviruses transmitted from the contaminated urine and feces of infected rodents cause two important human diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Annually, hundreds of thousands of cases of HFRS are reported throughout Euro-Asia, whereas hundreds of cases of HPS are reported in countries in North and South America. Because rodents act as the natural reservoir for hantaviruses and human-to-human infections are rare, understanding the ecology of hantavirus within their natural reservoir is important for preventing and controlling the emergence of such diseases. 32 The comparison of may hantavirus genomes form different rodent species has shown a clear correlation between the rodent species and the virus genotype, suggesting that hantavirus have coevolved with their natural hosts for >20 million years, since before the first humans evolved. It remains unclear how hantavirus exist within a rodent reservoir, particularly how they establish a persistent infection. In experiments with laboratory rats and mice, several groups have shown that an experimentally infected newborn animal readily develops a persistent infection, whereas an adult animal develops only a transient infection and recovers completely. On the other hand, epizootiological investigations have demonstrated that virus is transmitted between adult animals through wounds, and the adults develop a persistent infection.",

This now notorious group of viruses was discovered in 1967 when Marburg virus was identified as the etiological agent of a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in research facilities in Europe, which handled tissues from African green monkeys imported from Uganda. Subsequently, Ebola viruses were shown to be the cause of simultaneously occurring hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC, formerly Zaire) and Sudan. These outbreaks were shown to be caused by two different subtypes of Ebola virus, which became known as the Zaire and Sudan subtypes. Mortality rates of up to 80% were recorded in these and more recent outbreaks in DRC and Gabon in 1995-1996. Epidemiological data from recent outbreaks indicate that close contact is necessary for efficient transmission of Ebola virus from one individual to another, and little evidence can be found for aerosol transmission of the virus. Despite considerable efforts to identify the natural reservoir for Ebola and Marburg viruses, the host species remains an enigma. Although nonhuman primates have been implicated as the source of the introduction of the virus into humans during several of the identified outbreaks, they are not considered likely to represent reservoir species because of their susceptibility to high-mortality hemorrhagic disease similar to that seen in humans. NIPAH VIRUS Nipah virus is a newly discovered member of the paramyxovirus family of nonsegmented RNA viruses. This virus was responsible for a viral encephalitis outbreak in Malaysia that was first recognized in October 1998 and ended in midsummer 1999. This outbreak resulted in almost 300 confirmed infections, and the mortality rate for hospitalized cases was approximately 35%. Initially, Malaysian authorities thought the outbreak was caused by Japanese encephalitis (JE virus, a mosquito-borne RNA virus). However, JE vaccination and mosquito control efforts failed to halt the epidemic. The virus appeared to be first introduced into pigs, where close contact caused by intensive farming practices led to efficient pig-to-pig transmission, and subsequently pig-to-human transmission. Most human cases were in close proximity to the infected pigs. Genetic analysis showed Nipah virus to be closely related to Hendra virus, which recently was discovered in Australia as a cause of disease in horses and humans and also is maintained in Pteropus species fruit bats.",

How does the core protein induce these pathologies, and how may the other HCV proteins contribute to this phenotype? It is unclear whether this phenotype is a result of HCV protein expression directly or whether it occurs in combination with environmental or hostderived factors leading to chronic liver cell injury.

            "text": "Our understanding of emerging and reemerging viruses from an evolutionary perspective offers clear directions to follow. If we seriously plan to develop efficient and reasonable control strategies, an international concerted effort involving a thorough survey of the genetic diversity of viruses in time and space is a must. This will also help in understanding several processes that take place at the molecular level in a comparative context. More emphasis on multidisciplinary sciences is needed. Molecular biology and systematics, bioinformatics, data mining, and analysis are all becoming considerably sophisticated lately. Hepatitis C and HIV-1 are glaring proof that disease knows no national borders. The use of and development of animal models for studying viral diseases of humans will continue to be a necessary part of biomedical research in understanding the current viral diseases that affect humans and the new emerging viruses.",
