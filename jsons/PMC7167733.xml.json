Enveloped viruses present a membrane bilayer while non\u2010enveloped viruses lack this membrane and present on their surface only capsid proteins. The mechanism of cell invasion by the two groups of viruses is rather diverse and the foremost difference is the direct consequence of their distinctive physicochemical state at the interface that occurs at the time of the encounter between the virus and the cell membrane; in particular, two lipid membranes confronting each other in the case of enveloped viruses as opposed to a layer consisting only of proteins that face a lipid layer in the entry of naked viruses. Enveloped viruses entry exploits direct fusion with a cellular membrane through the involvement of specialized viral fusion proteins, present on the viral membrane and the consequent transfer of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm.3 On the other hand, the entry of non\u2010enveloped viruses, which lacking the outer viral membrane are unable to take advantage of the cellular mechanism of membrane fusion, involves the activation of viral lytic factors that induce cell membrane rupture.4 The major features in membrane interaction by enveloped and non\u2010enveloped viruses are reported in Figure 1.",

The infection starts with the binding to one or more host cell receptors leading to a receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis mechanism.41 The receptor binding induces a conformational change that initiates uncoating or viral disassembly once the particle is exposed to low pH within the endocytic pathway blocking this event often inhibits infection. The immature provirion FHV is initially assembled from 180 copies of the coat protein alpha and, subsequently, it undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage to generate the mature infectious virion which contains a large N\u2010terminal fragment, \u03b2 (363 amino acids), and a small C\u2010terminal fragment, \u03b3 (44 amino acids).41 The capsid shell is constituted by the central region of \u03b2 forms, while the \u03b3 peptides are the amphipathic helices non\u2010covalently associated with the capsid interior. The \u03b3 peptides are responsible of the interaction with the membrane and its local disruption which ends in viral entry. These peptides are composed of an N\u2010terminal amphipathic helix separated by a proline\u2013glycine\u2013proline turn from a hydrophobic C\u2010terminal region. The amphipathic \u03b3 helices are located in the interior of the capsid and when FHV enters cells through receptor mediated endocytosis, the \u03b3 peptides are exposed and determine the disruption of the membrane with consequent release of the viral genome in the cytosol.41 This is a dynamic process with \u03b3 peptides continuously, transiently, and reversibly exposed to the exterior of the capsid; \u03b3 peptides may not only be exposed but also released from the virus particle which may represent a common paradigm of non\u2010enveloped virus entry. In this dynamic process \u03b3 peptides may continuously \u201csample\u201d the environment until they encounter the appropriate cellular trigger; at this point the virus undergoes an irreversible conformational change in which the \u03b3 amphipathic helices insert into the target membrane, allowing the viral RNA to enter the cytoplasm.40\n",

The rigid, boomerang like structure assumed by the influenza fusion peptide in lipid environment is required to promote membrane fusion;79 in fact, abolishing the kink in the structure or making it flexible eliminates membrane fusion79 probably for the failure of the fusion peptide to insert deep into the lipid bilayer and pack against the hydrocarbon moieties. At neutral pH the \u03b3 peptide is able to cause membrane disruption; while at low pH it is only able to alter its location relative to the capsid, but does not increase its membrane interacting ability.74 Surprisingly, thanks to a kinked structure and a tight alignment of the hydrophobic residues on one side of the peptide at low pH similar to influenza virus, FHV \u03b3 peptide shows localized perturbation of lipid arrangements with no proof of pore formation.38, 70 While membrane destabilization requires the simple insertion of the fusion peptide into the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer, leakage needs both a deeper insertion and an interaction between peptides inside the membrane. The amphipathic region of \u03b3 peptide oligomerizes in bilayers71 with a low content of cholesterol, which being more fluid would promote association between peptides.74 The presence of the \u03b3 C\u2010terminus is absolutely necessary for virus entry;80 as a matter of fact, truncations, or point mutations in the C\u2010terminal region of \u03b3 determine a disordering of the pentameric bundle formed by the N\u2010terminal amphipathic helices of \u03b3 in FHV particles and hamper in vitro and in vivo membrane lysis. The pentameric bundles constitute the viral \u201cmembrane attack module,\u201d and an essential function of the \u03b3 C\u2010terminal region is to maintain this module in its correct conformation4 (Figure 3).
