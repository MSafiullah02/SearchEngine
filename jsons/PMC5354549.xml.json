            "text": "The hallmark of autophagy is the autophagosomes, double-membrane vesicles that\noriginate from cistern structures called phagophores and that eventually fuse with\nlysosomes, where their sequestered cargo is turned over. For a long time, autophagy\nhas been believed to be a non-selective, bulk degradation pathway within the cell,\nbut recent evidences highlighted that determined stimuli trigger selective types of\nautophagy to target specific structures for lysosomal turnover 1. In mammalian cells, the investigation of bacterial infections\nhas been an important source of knowledge for the mechanistic principles underlying\nselective types of autophagy (Fig. 1A). Selective degradation of pathogens by\nautophagy, also defined as xenophagy, was initially described for the intracellular\nelimination of Group A Streptococcus 2. Another extensively studied model for xenophagy is the infection of\nSalmonella. After escaping into the cytosol from phagosomes,\nSalmonella becomes rapidly ubiquitinated and is sequestered\ninto autophagosomes. These observations have prompted several groups to investigate\nthe proteins that are responsible to target (ubiquitinated) bacteria, but also other\npathogens into autophagosomes. These so-called autophagy receptors, which include\nnuclear dot protein 52 kDa (NDP52), p62 and OPTINEURIN (OPTN), have been identified\nand characterized by various laboratories 345. Although several autophagy receptors recognize the same bacterium,\ntheir function is not redundant but rather cooperative in restricting bacterial\ngrowth. The key feature of these autophagy receptors is that they can simultaneously\nbind ubiquitin and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Thereby,\nthey effectively mediate the sequestration of ubiquitinated bacteria into\nautophagosomes. These principles of xenophagy have also been shown to be valid for\nother selective types of autophagy, which permit the disposal of protein aggregates,\nmitochondria or mid body ring (Fig. 1A) 1. A\ncommon factor that connects different selective forms of autophagy is the\nTank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). TBK1 can phosphorylate multiple autophagy receptors\n(e.g. OPTN, p62, NDP52) and thereby enhances their binding to LC3. In particular,\nphosphorylation of OPTN by TBK1 promotes selective sequestration of microbes as well\nas mitochondria 6. In the context of\nSalmonella infection, the laboratory of Felix Randow has\nidentified another molecule, GALECTIN8, which is involved in xenophagy 7. This lectin does not bind directly to the\ninvading bacteria but rather interacts with the glycans present in the lumen of host\ncell organelles that get exposed when microbes, such as Salmonella,\ndisrupt the membrane of the bacterium-containing compartments. These membrane\nremnants are recognized by GALECTIN8, which in turn recruits NDP52 and thereby\ninitiates autophagosome formation in close proximity of the invading bacterium 7. In addition to GALECTIN8, GALECTIN3 also\nlocalizes to disrupted membranes during Shigella infection when the\nbacteria escape into the cytosol from phagosomes 8. Interestingly, GALECTIN3 also detects membranes of damaged lysosomes\nand acts as a signal for autophagy-mediated turnover of these organelles (Fig. 1A)\n9.",

            "text": "The study of microbes, in particular of bacteria, has also been valuable to acquire\nknowledge about the mechanism that leads to the assembly of the ATG machinery during\nselective types of autophagy (Fig. 1A). During bulk autophagy, the ATG machinery\nassembles by following a distinct sequential hierarchy to initiate the autophagosome\nformation 10. Kageyama and colleagues have\nrevealed that upon induction of the formation of autophagosomes that target invading\nSalmonella, the functional groups composing the ATG machinery\nact in parallel axes, rather than sequentially 11. In particular, although LC3 recruitment and\nlipidation in close proximity of the bacteria requires the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complex,\nthis localization is independent of ATG9 or phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P)\ngeneration. Nonetheless, components of the LC3 conjugation system as well as ATG9\nand FIP200, a subunit of the ULK kinase complex, are all required for suppression\nof Salmonella growth because they are all necessary for the\nautophagosome biogenesis. In line with these observations, Kageyama and colleagues\nalso observed that ATG9 associates to the invading bacteria prior to LC3. This model\nhas been strengthened by a recent study showing that the formation of an\nautophagosome in close proximity of Salmonella is also modulated by\nactivated TBK1. TBK1 is recruited to the ubiquitinated bacteria by different\nredundant mechanisms. This event is required for the localization of WIPI2, a\nPI3P-binding ATG protein, to the nascent autophagosome but not for the recruitment\nof LC3 12. Similar findings were reported for\nthe selective degradation of mitochondria where components of the ULK complex and\nATG9 are recruited to the mitochondria earlier than LC3 and in a manner that does\nnot require autophagy receptors 13. These\nfindings imply that the assembly mechanism of the ATG machinery (in particular LC3\nrecruitment) and the principles underlying autophagosome biogenesis initialization\nare different between selective and non-selective autophagy.",

It has recently been shown that the release of\nMycobacterium from amoebas in a non-lytic fashion is mediated\nby a so-called ejectosome. Although the ATG machinery is not required for the\ngeneration of the ejectosome, it is crucial to maintain plasma membrane integrity\nduring this Mycobacterium exit from host cells 14. Autophagy-mediated secretion is not only\nimportant for bacteria release from host cells but also for the egression of\nspecific viruses. Influenza virus is an example of a virus where optimal cell\nrelease depends on ATG proteins. Influenza M2 protein binds LC3 and thereby directs\nautophagosomes to the plasma membrane where they are required for the filamentous\nbudding and the stability of the virions 15.\nAnother example is the release of picornaviral particles. In addition to employ a\nlytic mechanism, the virions gain access to the extracellular milieu through a\nnon-lytic release that depends on the ATG machinery and autophagosome-like vesicles\n1617. Importantly, autophagy-mediated secretion has now been shown to be\nimportant for the extracellular export of endogenous factors such as cytokines,\nprotein aggregates and organelles during developmental processes 18.",

The most well-known of these unconventional functions is\nprobably the LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) 20. During LAP, the single membrane of phagosomes is modified to enhance\nlysosomal degradation of phagocytosed material, such as bacteria. This modification\nis characterized by the recruitment of LC3 through its covalent conjugation to the\nphosphatidylethanolamine present in the phagosomal membranes and it appears to\nrequire all ATG proteins except those that are part of the ULK kinase complex. LAP\nis triggered by infections by a variety of pathogens, including Burkholderia\npseudomallei, Leishmania major and fungi, through the\nstimulation of pattern recognition receptors including specific Toll-like receptors\n2021. In addition to this role in innate immunity, LAP is also involved in\nprocessing and facilitating antigen loading onto major histocompatibility complex\nclass II during infections contributing to adaptive immunity and plays a role in the\nclearance of dead cells by macrophages 2223.",

Importantly, our siRNA library also took\nin consideration the redundancy of specific ATG genes by combining the siRNA that\ntargeted them.
