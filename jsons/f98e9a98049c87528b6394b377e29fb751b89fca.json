The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavivirus-like viruses because, in contrast to the \"classic\" flaviviruses and other flavivirus-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size.",

One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter with either electron-translucent or electron-dense cores. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of Alongshan and Jingmen tick viruses.",

Since the virus did not cause any cytopathic effect in these cells, we changed the medium once every 14 days. Once every 1-2 months we checked the culture medium by RT-PCR for presence of the virus, using specific For two strains, Miass519 and Miass527, high-throughput sequencing of virus purified from IRE/CTVM19 cell supernate was carried out to obtain full genomes, while for the Galozero-14-T20426 strain partial sequences of segment 2 were obtained via Sanger sequencing using primers JMun1S and Miass_gly_1R (Table 1 , Supplementary file 2).

We detected an unknown rhabdovirus and named it IRE/CTVM19associated rhabdovirus.

The Chinese JMTV strain isolated from A. javanense ticks replicated successfully in the R. microplus embryo-derived tick cell line BME/CTVM23 but failed to grow in Vero, DH82 (canine monocyte-macrophage-derived cells) and C6/36 (Aedes albopictus mosquito) cells (8) . We isolated three tick-derived strains of ALSV using the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19; our results, together with those of the previous studies reporting successful in vitro isolation and continuous propagation of JMTV group viruses (5, 8, 18) , suggest the possibility that mammal-derived viruses will more readily infect mammalian cells, while tick-derived viruses may be more infective for tick cells. However, additional isolations of JMTV group viruses will be required to test this theory and the possible underlying genetic causes. For the first time we showed that the ALSV strain Miass527 can persist in tick cells for at least three years. It was previously shown that the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19 may harbour an unknown rhabdovirus (31) . Our experiment confirmed the presence of a rhabdovirus and suggests that it does not interfere with the persistence and active reproduction of Alongshan virus in IRE/CTVM19 cells. Persistent infection in tick cells and ticks could affect virus properties, as was previously shown for tick-borne encephalitis virus (34).",

Such proteins are present in a variety of RNA viruses and perform different functions. For example, in flaviviruses, small membrane proteins NS2B and NS4A (with sizes similar to the nuORF) perform multiple functions, ranging from enzyme cofactors (38, 39) to participation in particle formation (40, 41) and protection against the cellular antiviral response. Influenza A M2 protein acts as a proton-selective ion channel (42) , whereas Coronavirus E protein acts as a viroporin and plays a role in the induction of the regulation of the unfolded protein response (43) . Nevertheless, confirmation of the nuORF expression and understanding of its possible functions should be subjects for further studies.",

Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. Availability of these novel ALSV strains has enabled better understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within the JMTV group, and will facilitate further study of the origins, structure, replication, epidemiology, transmission, vertebrate hosts and medical and veterinary significance of these enigmatic segmented RNA viruses.

Sequences were divided into three groups (named\"JMTV\", \"ALSV\" and Yanggou virus) based on their positions in the phylogenetic tree (Supplementary file 4). Sequences obtained in the current study were included in the ALSV alignment. Analyses of Yanggou virus, ALSV and JMTV were performed separately, because of a low level of similarity between them. Nucleotide sequences of the ORF VP1a (in the case of ALSV and Yanggou virus) and VP1 (in the case of JMTV) were extracted from the full segments. The resultant sequences were codon-aligned using the online tool \u00abCodon Alignment v2.1.0\u00bb (available at https://hcv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/CodonAlign/codonalign.html) with default parameters. The resultant codon alignments were used as an input for the Synplot2 (27) online tool (available at http://guinevere.otago.ac.nz/cgi-bin/aef/synplot_c.pl) v. 2014-12-05/03:10:08 with default parameters (no reference sequence, n=12 (sliding window of 25 codons)).",

This new Miass527-infected culture was subcultured by splitting the cells at a ratio of 1:1 twice in the first 6 months of infection and after that was kept without passaging or subculture. In this condition Miass527-infected cells have been monitored for 3 years (observation is still continuing). IRE/CTVM19 cells inoculated with samples Miass519 and Galozero-14-T20426 were each subcultured 1:1 twice in the first 2 months after infection and, at the time of writing, have been monitored for 3.5 months .RT-PCR analysis revealed that the strain Miass527 successfully persisted in the tick cell line for a year, followed by one passage and further three years persistence at the time of writing.The other two strains, Miass519 and Galozero-14-T20426, had persisted for at least 3.5 months at the time of writing.",

Segment 3 contained a flavivirus NS3-like protein with proposed functions of serine protease and RNA helicase (Figure 3). Both proteins had transmembrane regions corresponding to the previously mapped strain H3. Segment 4 contained two non-Flavivirus-related ORFs. There was a slippery sequence (G GTT TTT) and some evidence of an RNA-structured region (Supplementary file 8) and we believe that the VP3 ORF may be expressed via -1 ribosome frameshifting (Figure 3), as was previously shown for other ALSV strains.
