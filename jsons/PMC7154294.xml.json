Immune responses to IBV have been reviewed (Dhinakar Raj &\nJones, 1997b; Cavanagh, 2003). Using either the H strain (Gillette, 1981; Toro & Fernandez, 1994) or the M41 strain (Hawkes et al., 1983), the importance of local immunity in the respiratory tract as a\nfirst line of defence against IB challenge has been demonstrated. Furthermore, Davelaar\n& Kouwenhoven (1976, 1980), using both the H120 and H52 vaccine strains, have demonstrated\nthe importance of the Harderian gland in the development of the immunity induced by IB\nvaccination. These findings were confirmed by Toro et al. (1996) who, in a histological study, demonstrated\nincreased plasma cell numbers and enlargement of lymphoid foci following eye-drop\nadministration of the H120 vaccine. It is therefore\nessential that this local immunity is stimulated by the careful application of the live\nattenuated IB vaccines. In addition, the induction of high and persistent levels of systemic\nimmunity is necessary to provide life-long protection against IB challenges. Although the\nrole of CMI in protecting against IB challenges has been less well studied than have other\naspects of IB-induced immunity, there is evidence that CMI responses occur following\nvaccination with the H strain (Timms & Bracewell, 1981). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the CMI response to H120\nvaccination may be cross-reactive (Dhinakar Raj & Jones, 1997a). Correct and careful application of the IB vaccine is\ntherefore essential to optimize the stimulation of all types of protective immunity.",

Therefore, in order to obtain more relevant\ninformation, a different approach to vaccine efficacy determination has been investigated\n(De Wit et al., 1998). These\nworkers performed a study of flock immunity after H120 vaccination and M41 challenge in\norder to determine whether vaccination reduced virus transmission; that is, to test whether\nIBV transmission among vaccinated chickens was significantly reduced compared with that\namong unvaccinated chickens. In two vaccinated and two unvaccinated groups of specific\npathogen free chickens, a standard measure for virus transmission, the reproduction ratio,\nwas determined (the reproduction ratio being defined as the average number of new infections\ncaused by one typical infectious individual during its entire infectious period). It was\nfound that a single eye-drop vaccination with H120 reduced the transmission of the challenge\nvirus among the vaccinated chickens significantly compared with the transmission among the\nunvaccinated chickens. H120 is the only IBV vaccine that has so far been tested in this\nway.",

Other immunization\ntechnologies include using transgenic-derived IBV protein (Song et al.,\n1998; Zhou et al., 2003), DNA vaccination (Seo et al.,\n1997; Kapczynski et al., 2003), homologous (IBV) vectored recombinant (Casais\net al., 2001, 2003; Dove et al., 2001; Hodgson et al., 2004) and heterologous virus-vectored vaccines (Yu\net al., 2001; Wang et\nal., 2002; Johnson et\nal., 2003).
