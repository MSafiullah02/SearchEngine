This symposium was co-sponsored by the International Society for Antiviral Research and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The purpose of the symposium was to bring together the leading experts to review the status of the current research regarding respiratory viruses and to provide new insights about the epidemiology, clinical impact, detection including rapid diagnostics, pathogenesis and management of these infections. The emphasis was on novel approaches to immunization and antiviral treatment. The meeting was intended to benefit all those working in the field through a multidisciplinary approach and serve as a forum for open discussion among representatives from academia, government and industry in directing future research.",

            "text": "Respiratory viral infections continue to be leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and economic loss throughout the world. During the last few decades the reported incidence of acute respiratory tract infections has increased globally, and the annual rate of pneumonia has increased in persons \u226565 years of age (Han et al., 1999). Some years ago, investigators of ten countries around the world have estimated the global burden of respiratory infections in children (Selwyn, 1990). The incidence of acute respiratory infections among children of 0\u201359 months of age ranged from 13 to 17 new episodes per 100 child-weeks at risk. The rate of lower respiratory tract infection ranged from 0.2 to 3.4 new episodes per 100 child-weeks at risk. Children spent from 22 to 40% of observed weeks with an acute respiratory tract illness and from 1 to 14% of observed weeks with a lower respiratory tract illness. Case fatality rates varied from 3 to 16% in hospitalized children; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the main pathogen identified. This observation, and other studies, show that in developing countries lower respiratory tract infections in children are leading causes of disability and death (Pelletier et al., 1995; Paxton et al., 1996). However, the pattern of respiratory viral infections depends on geographical location, season, syndrome (upper versus lower respiratory tract), age, and setting (ambulatory versus hospital).",

Measles and influenza virus were the most common etiologies identified, and measles and RSV were the leading causes of hospitalization. In Singapore respiratory viral outbreaks among hospitalized infants were associated with RSV infections in 72% of cases and with influenza or parainfluenza viruses in 11% of cases (Chew et al., 1998). RSV outbreaks occurred mainly during the dry season. However, the seasonality of RSV infections differs in other parts of the world; for example, in The Gambia RSV outbreaks occurred during the rainy season (Weber et al., 1998). In Kenya, respiratory viruses were demonstrated in 54% of 822 children with acute respiratory infections (Hazlett et al., 1988). Measles, RSV, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and adenoviruses were observed, but rhinoviruses, herpes simplex and enterovirus were also associated with some cases of severe acute respiratory infections. In 328 Indian children under 5 years of age hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infections, 35% were diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis. Viruses were found in 81% of them, and RSV was responsible for 57% of cases of bronchiolitis. Parainfluenza viruses were the next most common, responsible for 11% of cases (Cherian et al., 1990). In Brazil the cause of acute respiratory tract illness was investigated in 175 young children living in the community during a 2-year period (Arruda et al., 1991). Respiratory viruses were isolated from 35% of samples. Of the isolates, 46% were rhinoviruses, 16% PIV, 16% enteroviruses, 10% adenoviruses, 7% herpes viruses and 6% influenza viruses. In this study RSV was not detected; in another study from Brazil, RSV was responsible for 38% of cases of acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children (Sutmoller et al., 1995).",

Over one-half of these conditions were medically attended. In children of <5 years of age and in children of 5\u201317 years of age, the annual number of all respiratory conditions were 32 333 000 and 61 875 000, respectively. The proportion of respiratory conditions medically attended was 80% for children <5 years of age and 47% for children of 5\u201317 years of age. The annual number of school days lost for an acute respiratory condition is estimated to be about 96 612 000. The number of work-loss days for currently employed adults of 18 years of age or over is estimated to be 134 676 000. Demographic and social factors play an important role in the occurrence of respiratory viral diseases. For example, the impact of these respiratory tract infections is higher in low-income families and in populations with poor social conditions. The rate of documented RSV hospitalizations seems to have doubled during the last 5 years compared to similar surveys carried out in 1977\u20131983, probably because of wider application of rapid diagnostic assays. During a prospective evaluation of US children hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness between 1991 and 1995, RSV was recovered in 27% of cases, followed by parainfluenza viruses, and influenza (P. Glezen, personal communication). Investigations were negative in 38% of cases.",

In the elderly 64% of these acute respiratory conditions were medically attended. Despite an influenza vaccination rate of 65% among the \u226565-year-old persons, two successive influenza epidemics with excess mortality occurred during the last 2 years. These epidemics are estimated to have resulted in more than 40 000 excess deaths per year.

The HA gene is a key factor in pathogenicity for avian viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes. The outbreak in Mexico in 1995, which killed thousands of chickens, was caused by an H5N2 strain. This virus acquired pathogenicity because the HA had a polybasic amino acid sequence that could be cleaved by host cell enzymes; highly cleavable HA also occurred in chicken H5 isolates during the Hong Kong outbreak in 1997. Before poultry slaughter, 14% of chicken and 2% of ducks carried H5N1 virus. Molecular analysis of Hong Kong H5N1 viruses revealed that each of the gene segments evolved rapidly except the HA gene, suggesting that this gene has been present in domestic avian species for some time. Analysis of viruses isolated from domestic poultry during the Hong Kong outbreak revealed that in addition to H5N1 influenza viruses, a number of other influenza subtypes including H3N8, H6N1, H6N9, H9N2, and H1N9 cocirculated in birds. Internal gene sequence homologies of 97\u201398% between Quail/Hong Kong/G9/97 (H9N2) and A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1) suggest that an H9N2 virus could have been the source of internal genes of the pathogenic H5N1 virus in Hong Kong. Some evidence suggests that the HA gene of the H5N1 virus in Hong Kong may have been derived from an influenza virus of geese (Section 3).",

This virus did not possess the polybasic amino acid sequence connecting HA1 and HA2 subunits of the hemagglutinin that is associated with high pathogenicity of some avian influenza viruses of H5 and H7 subtypes. Samples have recently been obtained from humans buried in permafrost in Norway and studies are underway to determine if viral RNA is present.

Moreover, this virus had a deletion of three nucleotides in the HA gene, and this genetic change conferred a dramatic change in antigenicity. By November 1998, this H1N1 variant was detected in patients from Asia, Africa, Europe and North America, and consequently was included in the 1998\u20131999 influenza vaccine.",

These two influenza B virus strains are related to either B/Yamagata/2/87 or B/Yamagata/16/88. Viruses related to B/Yamagata/16/88 have circulated worldwide from 1990 to the present, and a current derivative is included in recent vaccines. B/Yamagata/2/87-like viruses have been detected only in Asia. Surveillance data have shown that this strain was predominant in China during the last 2 years and that outbreaks have occurred in pediatric populations in China. Moreover, recently this strain was identified in other Asian countries. The lack of preexisting immunity for this virus in western populations leaves many individuals susceptible to infection, and concern about the potential for global spread of this second lineage has increased.",

More recent studies indicate that 20\u201330% of BMT recipients with an acute respiratory illness are infected with a community respiratory virus. About one-half of cases are associated with pneumonia which is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 50% depending on virus type. In 133 consecutive cases of patients with BMT developing a viral respiratory infection, the mortality rates were 61% for RSV, 39% for PIV, 43% for influenza A and B viruses, 72% for adenovirus, 79% for CMV and 100% in seven cases of rhinovirus infection (E. Whimbley, personal communication). Neutropenia secondary to chemotherapy for acute leukemia is also a risk factor for severe community respiratory virus infection, particularly for RSV. An upper respiratory tract infection, such as an acute rhino-pharyngitis, leads to a pneumonia in 60\u201380% of cases when a myelosuppression is present.

The occurrence of 18 human cases and six deaths caused by an influenza A H5N1 virus in Hong Kong in 1997 raised concern that next pandemic could be imminent. Based on analysis of poultry samples, it was shown that prior to and at the time of the epidemic, H5N1 viruses were circulating in poultry farms and live bird markets in Hong Kong. Analysis of H5N1 viruses isolated from humans during the outbreak revealed that all eight RNA gene segments of these viruses were of avian origin. The HA gene was closely related to the Eurasian lineage of viruses. Antigenic analysis revealed that there were two antigenic groups that possessed corresponding genetic changes encoding a potential glycosylation site at amino acid 156 in only one of the two groups. The NA protein of these viruses shares a deletion of 19 amino acids in the stalk region. As discussed above (Section 2.3), the pathogenic H5N1 recovered in Hong Kong appears to have the internal genes of an avian virus of quail, and perhaps the H5 of avian virus from geese. Epidemiological studies indicated that the transmission was primarily from poultry to humans and was inefficient. Recent experiments with chickens suggest that the transmission of H5N1 among poultry was fecal-oral and probably not by aerosol. Whether this occurred by respiratory droplets or by a fecal-oral route in humans is unclear. Human to human transmission may have occurred in a limited numbers of cases. No new humans cases have been detected since poultry culling took place in December 1997. Nevertheless, concern remains that H5N1 viruses may pose a reemerging threat at some time in the future.",

The H5N1 viruses isolated from chickens and humans possessed hemagglutinin molecules with multiple basic amino acids adjacent to the HA cleavage site, a finding characteristic of virulent avian influenza viruses. This observation, and the fact that the H5N1 virus was lethal for chickens are consistent with the presumption that this insertion allows cellular proteases to cleave the hemagglutinin and enable the virus to spread to visceral sites outside of the respiratory tract. However, extrapulmonary dissemination of virus was not documented in human cases in Hong Kong. When four H5N1 human isolates (HK156, HK483, HK485 and HK486) were inoculated into BALB/c mice, each virus replicated well in mouse lung. These viruses were lethal for mice and replicated in multiple organs but showed different patterns of virulence. HK483 and HK485 were 100% lethal at any dose, HK156 was intermediate, and HK486 was associated with relatively low mortality of 10%. Brain invasion was associated with disease progression and lethality but was not observed in mice infected with the HK486 virus, which replicated only in the lungs. Viral antigens were detected in smooth muscle and in the brain. Thus, strains of the Hong Kong H5N1 virus were competent and in some instances neurotropic without prior adaptation to a mammalian host.",

Immunity is present early after exposure so that markers for infection remain negative, and is active at the mucosal surface (Couch et al., 1984). Immune mediators that share these characteristics are antibodies to the hemagglutinin or the neuraminidase as either IgG or as IgA in serum or secretions. Anti-hemagglutinin antibody will inhibit adsorption of virus and can contribute to inhibition of release from infected cells, while the major function of antineuraminidase antibody is inhibition of viral release so that spread of infection is impaired (Dowdle et al., 1974). In human studies, infants born of mothers with high levels of neutralizing antibody were protected for longer periods, thus demonstrating the value of passive immunity directed toward the subunits (Puck et al., 1980). An increase in anti-neuraminidase antibody, as a result of vaccination was associated with a reduced amount of virus in nasal secretions, a finding consistent with the concept of neuraminidase activity (Couch et al., 1974). When these various antibodies were quantitatively related to the occurrence of infection and illness, it was noted that serum neutralizing, nasal secretion neutralizing, serum anti-neuraminidase, and nasal secretion neuraminidase antibody all mediated reduced severity of the infection with increasing titers of the antibody (Couch, personal communication). Thus, all antibody modalities appear capable of contributing to immunity. That serum IgG anti-HA antibody is the most important mediator based on studies indicating IgG is the dominant antibody in lower respiratory secretions and it is derived from serum. Since, the majority of infections are considered to be initiated by small particle aerosol with deposition of virus about equally in the nasopharynx and lower respiratory tract and the infectivity for the lower respiratory tract is 30- to 100-fold lower that that for the nasopharynx, serum IgG antibody to the HA would be the first line defense against infection (Couch et al., 1984).",

In a recent study in a IgA knockout mouse, there were no differences in infection responses between mice with and without IgA antibody in serum and secretions suggesting that this antibody is not required for protection (Mbawuike, unpublished data). Studies of influenza in mice recently have focused on the role of specific lymphocytes and cytokines in immunity. These have confirmed earlier studies that CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) occur in the lower airways and appear to be primary mechanism for recovery from virus infection. These cells control pneumonia via a perforin or FAS-mediated cell destruction mechanism. In knockout mice it was clear that either CD4 or CD8 deficient animals can recover in a near normal fashion. In contrast, when both are absent, there is a marked impairment in recovery from infection (Eichelberger et al., 1991; Scherle et al., 1992; Topham and Doherty, 1998). Cytokine studies have show the dominance of interferon gamma in lungs during infection while a number of other cytokines are also present that could contribute to disease and recovery (Sarawar et al., 1993; Kelso et al., 1996). Overall, the large number of factors described that can contribute to the inflammatory response and to control of virus replication indicate the recovery process is complex.",

Difficulty with providing data in humans comparable to inbred mice relates to methodology.

Submucosal edema is often prominent but neutrophils are uncommon. The alveoli are relatively spared and giant cells/syncytia are infrequent. In the immunocompromised host, giant cell pneumonia and syncytia are commonly found along with inflammatory infiltrates containing neutrophils.

            "text": "Non-asthmatic persons undergoing a rhinoviral infection will develop principally upper respiratory symptoms and only infrequently exhibit lower respiratory symptoms. During rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbation, nasal aspirates of children have increased levels of IL-8 and neutrophil myeloperoxydase. Increased nasal wash IL-8 levels also correlate with airway hyperreactivity in asthmatic subjects experimentally infected with rhinovirus type 16 (Grunberg et al., 1997a; Teran et al., 1997). These results suggest that neutrophils are involved in the inflammatory response to rhinovirus, but their role in lower respiratory tract infection is unclear. Eosinophil major basic protein is increased in nasal secretions during rhinovirus infection in asthmatic children, and increased levels of the eosinophil cationic protein have also been observed in sputum in asthmatic subjects undergoing experimental rhinovirus infections (Grunberg et al., 1997b). Eosinophils are found in increased numbers in the airways of asthmatic persons with experimental rhinovirus infection, which suggests that eosinophil infiltration is a crucial element of the pathology leading to exacerbation of asthma (Fraenkel et al., 1995). In addition, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration occurs in the lower but not in the upper respiratory tract epithelium and submucosa during experimental rhinovirus colds. In vivo studies have demonstrated that HRV infection of respiratory epithelial cells induces its own receptor, ICAM-1 (E. Arruda, personal communication). Up regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 by HRV infection may play a role in the retention and activation of intraepithelial lymphocytes and eosinophils. As VCAM-1 is important in eosinophil infiltration, factors regulating its expression may therefore represent targets for therapeutic intervention.",

In particular, they induce responses with limited durability and induce very limited cross-strain protection, are contraindicated for individuals with severe egg allergy, and are less effective in frail older adults, in whom the complications of influenza are most severe. One strategy to improve the immune response is the use of adjuvant. ISCOM (immunostimulating complexes) are cage-like structures containing different exogenous non-replicating antigens. The ISCOM presentation system induces CD8 CTL response and can induce antibodies even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. ISCOM influenza vaccine studies in macaques have been shown to be superior to classical vaccine in term of antibody and T-cell responses and protection. An ISCOM vaccine containing H5N1 virus provides superior antibody responses in chickens, but no data are currently available on protection. Preliminary clinical studies using different ISCOM preparations have failed to demonstrate any clear benefit in humans and the development has been abandoned at present.",

Although the precise mechanism of action remains controversial, it is generally accepted that the purified DNA is taken up by cells and the antigens are then synthesized inside the cells. This neosynthesis of antigen inside the host cells leads to the association of the antigens with class I or II MHC molecules, migration to the cell surface and presentation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes or T helper cells. In this manner, DNA vaccines are able to elicit immune responses similar to attenuated live viral vaccines. In addition to this novel means of MHC class I antigen presentation, DNA vaccines offer several other advantages. DNA is thermally stable and because the plasmid persists for some time at the site of inoculation, responses may be more durable than those induced with protein vaccines. DNA vaccines are not associated with viral vector-induced immune responses which can dampen immune responses to target antigens. In the context of influenza vaccination, DNA is not produced in eggs and may not require annual re-vaccination. Adjuvants may improve immune responses to DNA vaccines by a number of mechanisms, including improved efficiency of transfection of DNA, improved targeting of DNA to specific cell types, activation or recruitment of antigen presenting cells, or protection of DNA from degradation. In animals, aluminum adjuvant (alum or aluminum phosphate) improves antibody responses but does not increase plasmid protein expression.",

Detailed study found that the 248 mutation in L specifies a significant reduction of plaque formation at 38\u00b0C and is responsible for intermediate attenuation in mice. In contrast, the other L mutation did not contribute to the temperature sensitive or the attenuation phenotype. Unexpectedly, the 404-M2 mutation alone specified complete restriction of plaque formation at 37\u00b0C and high level of attenuation in mice.

Since 1977, 17 outbreaks of RSV infections in nursing home populations have been reported.",

            "text": "Reinfections with RSV are associated with considerable reduction of illness severity (Henderson et al., 1979). Maternal antibody to RSV passively acquired by the fetus has been shown to protect against lower respiratory tract illness. Animal model studies have demonstrated the potential benefit of passively administered RSV immunoglobulins (Prince et al., 1985; Siber et al., 1994). Subsequent trials of humanized murine monoclonal antibodies directed to the F protein have yielded different results. In the cotton rat model protection against RSV lung infection was achieved by passively transferred antibody (Graham et al., 1993). In primates human IVIG administered locally or systematically are effective in reducing titers of virus recovered from lungs and nose. Polyclonal preparations with high titers of neutralizing antibody were shown to provide protection against severe RSV illness in premature infants and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Hemming et al., 1995; The PREVENT Study Group, 1997). One monoclonal antibody preparation, Medi-493 (palivizumab, Synagis\u2122), was shown to be effective in preventing hospitalization for RSV in premature infants and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In a randomized study among 1502 children with prematurity or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, palivizumab resulted in a 50% reduction of hospitalization for RSV (10.6% in the placebo group vs. 4.8% in the palivizumab group). This effect was mainly observed in the subgroup of infants with prematurity (8.1 vs. 1.8%, respectively) and was less significant in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia alone (12.8 vs. 7.9%, respectively) (The IMpact-RSV Study Group, 1998). Another monoclonal antibody, RSHZ19, did not provide a protective effect, possibly because of lower neutralizing activity. Considering the high cost of these preparations, prophylaxis should be considered only in high-risk patients such as children of less than 2 years of age with chronic lung diseases, and possibly in premature infants of 32 weeks or less during the RSV season.",

Neuraminidase is a tetrameter, and the active enzyme site is located within a pocket on the surface of each glycoprotein subunit. The active site is highly conserved across influenza A and B viruses. This enzyme is responsible for the cleavage of bonds existing between neuraminic acid and adjacent sugar residues. The main actions of this enzyme are to promote virion release from infected cells and to prevent virus aggregation. Its action also prevents inactivation of influenza virus by respiratory mucus and facilitates spread within the respiratory tract. At least one type of influenza neuraminidase can also bind plasminogen, which contributes to HA cleavage activation of certain strains. Based on the crystallographic structure of NA, two neuraminidase inhibitors have reached advanced clinical development: inhaled zanamivir (GG167) and oral GS4104.

Inhaled zanamivir is well tolerated without known significant side-effects. Experimental infection studies in animals and humans have shown the protective effect of topical zanamivir. In experimental human influenza zanamivir given intranasally was 82% effective in preventing infection and 95% effective in preventing febrile illness (Hayden et al., 1996). Early treatment was shown to decrease virus titers in nasal wash and to decrease symptoms. Intravenous administration in experimental human infection was also highly protective (Calfee et al., 1998). The protective efficacy of inhaled zanamivir was tested in healthy ambulatory adults during an influenza outbreak. Once influenza virus was circulating in the community, inhalation of zanamivir once daily or placebo for 4 weeks, was initiated (Monto et al., 1998). The efficacy of the antiviral in the prevention of laboratory confirmed clinical influenza illness was 67%, and efficacy in prevention of influenza infection with or without symptoms was 31%.

Among young healthy adults suffering from natural influenza, oral GS4104 treatment shortened the median duration of symptoms which was 4.3 days in the placebo groups and 2.9 in the groups receiving one or two doses of GS4104 (Treanor et al., 1998). This was associated with a 40% reduction in symptom severity. Importantly, GS4104 treatment was associated with a reduction in physician-diagnosed complications requiring antibiotics. Further studies of oral GS4104 for treating influenza in children and in elderly and high-risk adults are in progress.",

However, selection of resistant variants requires considerably more effort than for amantadine and rimantadine. Genotypic analysis of these mutants indicates that mutations in either of the major surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA), can confer resistance to this class of compounds. The most common mutation observed on neuraminidase is a Gly substitution for a Glu at residue 119. This residue interacts directly with the guanidino moiety of zanamivir. Other substitutions at residue 119 and at catalytic site Arg292 have been found in vitro. The neuraminidase bearing mutations at 119 have reduced sensitivity to zanamivir (more than 100-fold) in neuraminidase inhibition assays. However, these variants have either reduced enzyme activity or stability. The in vitro selected zanamivir-resistant mutants possessing mutations in their neuraminidase also demonstrated reduced infectivity when tested in mice. Some mutations identified on the HA reside in close proximity to the receptor binding site, and result in the reduction of the virus affinity for cellular receptors. Such variants have decreased dependence on neuraminidase activity for release from infected cells. Because this mechanism of resistance is independent of the neuraminidase activity, the HA mutants have demonstrated cross-resistance to the other neuraminidase inhibitors in cell culture. One HA mutant resistant in vitro was fully sensitive to zanamivir in mice, and the impact of the HA mutations on the pathogenicity of zanamivir-resistant influenza viruses in humans remains to be determined.",

An HA mutation (198 Thr\u2192Ile) was detected after 7 days of treatment. This mutation abolished a glycosylation site in close proximity to the HA receptor binding site and reduced the virus affinity for Sia\u03b12-6Gal-receptors. The HA mutation was followed by a mutation in the neuraminidase active site of the virus (152 Arg\u2192Lys). Arg 152 is a functional residue which directly interacts with the sialic acid moiety and participates in the substrate binding. This mutation led to a 1000-fold reduction in the enzyme sensitivity to zanamivir. The mutant enzyme activity had 3\u20135% of the enzyme activity in vitro compared to the wild type virus. As man and ferret share similar specificity of the receptors present on the respiratory tract epithelium (Sia\u03b12-6Gal) challenge of ferrets was done. This experiment has shown a growth preference of the parental virus over the mutant in the untreated, although not in the zanamivir-treated ferrets. In addition, the mutant virus demonstrated a reduced virulence: a greater quantity of the mutant virus was required to establish a productive infection of ferrets when compared with the parent and the nasal wash virus titers, cells counts and protein levels were lower in the animals infected with the mutant virus.",

The mutant virus has an increased affinity for MDCK cell receptors which in combination with a reduced neuraminidase activity renders this virus sensitive to zanamivir in this cell culture. These data indicate that the current methods for monitoring resistant mutants are potentially flawed due to the absence of a cell culture system that adequately reflects the human respiratory tract epithelium.

Furthermore, ribavirin has been shown to directly inhibit the initiation and elongation of virus-specific RNA polymerase. Emergence of resistance does not occur. Ribavirin administration was adapted for inhalation by the development of the small particle (<4 \u03bcm) aerosol generator (SPAG). Small, water aerosol-controlled studies in infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis and pneumonia led to licensure of the drug for RSV disease in children. The use of ribavirin in young infants has become increasingly controversial due to the lack of large clinical randomized trials with appropriate controls showing effect on clinical relevant endpoints.
