Purification of the recombinant domain involved protein denaturation and refolding. To examine the oligomerization state of the refolded protein, a gel filtration step was included in the present study. According to the estimated molecular sizes, most refolded protein was in a monomeric form, while some associated with each other and formed dimers or probably even dodecamers (Fig. 1A). Activity assays indicated that the monomer has optimal RTPase and ATPase activities (Figs. 1B and C, respectively). Activity for unwinding duplex RNA was also surveyed for each of the protein forms since many viral helicases have been shown to function as hexa- or oligomers (Goregaoker and Culver, 2003, Levin and Patel, 1999, Uhlmann-Schiffler et al., 2002). However, no RNA unwinding activity was observed for any protein forms (data not shown).",

            "text": "Reversible formaldehyde crosslinking is frequently utilized in protocols for assaying protein\u2013DNA interactions in vivo, e.g. chromatin immunoprecipitation (Perez-Romero and Imperiale, 2007). It has also been adopted in the mapping of amino acid residues involved in the direct binding of proteins to nucleic acids (Kim et al., 2005). This technique relies on the formation of methylene bridges between the side chains of Lys, Arg, His, Cys, aromatic amino acids and bases (A, G, and C) of nucleic acids (Bernard et al., 2004). These crosslinks can be reversed via rehydration of the methylene bridges and release of formaldehyde by heating the sample; therefore, the binding partners can be characterized (Orlando et al., 1997). To further understand the structure\u2013function relationship of the BaMV helicase-like domain, particularly with respect to its RNA-binding function, the protein in its monomeric form was incubated with a 3\u2032-biotinylated 15-nt RNA in the presence of formaldehyde as described in Materials and methods. After digestion with trypsin, the peptides covalently linked to biotinylated RNA were affinity purified with avidin resin. After extensive washes, the crosslinked adduct was heated at 70 \u00b0C for 60 min to release the conjugated peptides, which were then subjected to sequence analysis by LC-MS/MS. To enhance the reliability of the data, the above experiment was repeated four times. Peptides repeatedly found to bind biotinylated RNA were selected and listed in Table 1\n. They are distributed over the helicase-like domain, including two regions encompassing motifs I and II, respectively (Fig. 2\n). No peptide fragments deriving from the BaMV helicase-like domain were obtained in the parallel control reaction, in which the addition of formaldehyde was omitted. Several positively charged residues and a tyrosine within the selected peptidyl regions were then substituted with alanine for functional analysis based on their potential to interact with the RNA substrate. Eleven mutant proteins were expressed and purified. All had similar gel filtration profiles compared to WT.",

            "text": "The effects on RNA-binding ability of each mutation were first examined by Northwestern assay (Fig. 3\n). After normalization to the amount of protein loaded, the mutant domains exhibited slightly decreased abilities to bind a 5\u2032-terminal 178-nt genomic transcript compared to WT (Fig. 3A). It should be noted that the thioredoxin/hexahistidine/S-tag did not bind the RNA probe (data not shown). The binding ability was also assayed based on the mobility shift of a 50-nt RNA probe on native PAGE (Fig. 3B). Adding more amounts of the helicase-like domain in the reaction mixture would restrain more RNA molecules from migration. Once again, only minor effects on RNA binding were observed in response to the mutations. These results could be due to RNA-binding forces being contributed by every individual interaction, thus any single mutation would not significantly affect the overall binding strength. Alternatively, it is a possibility that none of the selected residues actually plays a role in RNA binding, however, this is an unlikely case. Previous studies showed that mutations at the consensus residues of motifs I and II abolished ATPase and RTPase activities (Han et al., 2007). The ability of the corresponding mutant proteins, K643A/S644A and D702A respectively, to bind RNA was also examined by gel mobility shift assay. Mutations at motif I slightly reduced the RNA-binding ability, whereas that at motif II did not cause a significant change.",

Mutations of Y704 or K706, both located in motif II, abrogated both activities, suggesting that the critical region of motif II extends beyond the consensus DE/D residues. Mutation of H636, which is just in front of motif I, also severely inhibited activity. Substitution of alanine for R645, immediately downstream of the GKS signature of motif I, still retained approximately 50% activity. The mutational effects of R597A were around the same magnitude as R645A. K843A differentially affected ATPase and RTPase with the former decreased to 42% and the latter to 17% of WT. The rest of the mutant proteins were comparable to WT for both activities. The similar effects on ATPase and RTPase of mutations corroborate a previous hypothesis that the catalytic sites of the two activities overlap extensively.",

In general, effects on the two measurements in response to a given mutation were similar, suggesting that the changes in coat protein accumulation mainly resulted from changes in the efficiency of viral replication. Virus carrying H636A, Y704A, or K706A failed to accumulate viral RNA and coat protein above detectable levels. The lack of the 5\u2032 cap, due to the disabled RTPase, is enough to cause failure of the virus. By contrast, viruses with K603A, R628A, H794A, or R799A were able to reproduce, at an efficiency within \u223c 35\u201365% of WT, as their ATPase and RTPase activities were approximately equal to that of WT.",

R597A and R645A both retained approximately half of the enzymatic activity of WT. R597A barely reproduced in protoplasts, however R645A could reproduce with efficiency consistent with its ATPase and RTPase activities. K843A mutation had similar effects on RTPase activity and replication efficiency, suggesting that RTPase activity as low as 20% of WT is enough to sustain viral replication. A previous study using the Q826A mutation suggested that greatly enhanced ATP-binding ability might deteriorate viral RTPase activity in vivo due to the mutual exclusion of the two substrates (Han et al., 2007). Could this also be an explanation for the unexpected results of the R597A and K610A mutations? Kinetic analysis of ATPase activity based on an enzyme-coupled assay was selectively carried out on WT, R597A, K603A, and K610A (Table 2\n). The magnitudes of K\nm and k\ncat were not changed significantly due to the mutations. Collectively, the results implied that in addition to its involvement in ATPase and RTPase activities, the BaMV helicase-like domain may have other functions required for replication.",

Thus, binding of the three mutant proteins to the 3\u2032UTR was assayed with the same technique in this study (Fig. 6\n). These results showed that R597A, K603A, K610A, and WT exhibited similar binding strength to the 3\u2032UTR, suggesting that this specific interaction is not the basis for the replication incompetence of R597A and K610A.",

The GKS/T signature of motif I is highly conserved across all the three superfamilies, whereas the consensus sequences of motif II are slightly different, with DE/D in SF1 and SF3 and DEAD, DEAH, or DExH in different subfamilies of SF2. Other motifs including III, V, and VI are specific to each superfamily or subfamily. Comparison between the structures of SF1 helicases, e.g. Rep bound to ss-DNA (Korolev et al., 1997) and PcrA (Subramanya et al., 1996), and SF2 helicase, e.g. HCV NS3 (Yao et al., 1997), revealed that the core domains of the helicases have similar folds, characteristic of a large central parallel \u03b2-sheet flanked by \u03b1-helices, although there is little sequence homology between the SF1 and SF2 helicases (Korolev et al., 1998). Together with structures of other RNA-bound helicases, including eIF4AIII (Andersen et al., 2006) and DEAD-box protein Vasa (Sengoku et al., 2006), the functions of helicase motifs have been concluded as follows: motifs I, II, and VI for ATP binding and hydrolysis, motifs III and V for coordinating nucleic acid binding and ATPase activity, and the less conserved motifs including motif IV and motifs Ia, Ib, Ic, Id, IVa, IVb, and Va, when present, for nucleic acid binding (Lee and Yang, 2006, Jankowsky and Fairman, 2007).",

It is known that motifs I, II, and VI are essential for both of the activities (Han et al., 2007); however, the regions responsible for RNA binding remained largely unclear before this study. In the present study, formaldehyde crosslinking between the viral helicase-like domain and RNA identified several peptidyl regions that could potentially contact RNA. The finding of motif I- and II-containing regions in association with RNA is understandable, as the two motifs play essential roles in cleaving the 5\u2032 \u03b3-phosphate off the RNA substrate. Three other non-conserved peptidyl regions were also found to bind RNA. Compared with the bona fide helicases described above, the BaMV helicase seems to bind RNA by using different peptidyl regions. Specifically, the sequence of the BaMV helicase-like domain, along with several homologues from other plant viruses, aligns with the well-characterized DNA helicase PcrA (Fig. 9\n). As members of SF1, all the proteins have similar consensus sequences within motifs I, II, III, V, and VI. However, the helicase-like domains of plant viruses are shorter than PcrA and lack motifs Ia, Ib, Ic, Id, IVa, IVb, and Va, which are responsible for DNA binding in PcrA (Lee and Yang, 2006).",

Eleven mutant proteins were thus created and purified. The capability of the BaMV helicase-like domain to bind RNA was not significantly affected by any single mutation. Similar results had been observed in a previous HCV NS5B-RNA binding study, in which a less than two-fold decrease in the affinity for RNA was seen in response to single point mutation (Kim et al., 2005). In addition, the magnitudes of K\nm of mutant proteins, R597A, K603A, and K610A, toward ATP were not altered significantly. Collectively, these results suggest that the mutations should not cause significant changes in the structure of BaMV helicase-like domain. Therefore, the effects on viral replication in vivo should be due to the inherent functions of the mutated residues, rather than the result of drastic changes of the protein structure.",

First, H636A, Y704A, and K706A caused severe or even deadly effects on not only in vitro ATPase and RTPase activities but also viral replication in protoplasts. Disabled enzymatic activities should be the cause for infertility of the mutant viruses in plant cells. In theory, RNA helicase activity is important for viral survival by unwinding duplex RNA, e.g. stem-loop and hairpin structures, to facilitate the replication process or avoid RNA interference. Although the possession of helicase activity remains uncertain, ATPase activity is a prerequisite for such a presumable activity. Without the fuel provided by ATPase, the presumable helicase activity could not function normally. RTPase is another essential function for viral replication. If unable to form the 5\u2032-cap at plus sense viral RNAs, viral protein translation would be shut down. Conservation of these three residues in most potexviruses may provide a clue to the importance of the residues (Fig. 9).",

However, replication of the two mutant viruses in protoplasts was very limited. This discrepancy suggests that the peptidyl region encompassing residues 597\u2013610 may be involved in the unproven helicase activity or some other unidentified functions required for replication. BMV 1a protein represents an example that demonstrates the involvement of a helicase-like domain in viral replication by additional mechanisms such as assembling the replication complex and regulating viral protein translation (Chen and Ahlquist, 2000, Chen et al., 2001, Yi et al., 2007).",

Similar levels of accumulation also resulted from R645A, H794A, and R799A. However, there is an apparent disparity in viral infectivity between the two groups. The former accumulated much lower amounts of GFP than the latter in the inoculated leaves of C. quinoa and N. benthamiana, suggesting that viral cell-to-cell movement was somewhat restricted by K603A and R628A mutations. The involvement of the helicase-like domain in viral cell-to-cell movement was also demonstrated previously in Tobacco mosaic virus (Hirashima and Watanabe 2003). Mutations of R645A and H794A constitute the fourth class. Although virus carrying either mutation could reproduce properly in inoculated leaves of N. benthamiana, it could not move into systemic leaves as efficiently as WT and R799A.

It is tempting to assume that such a protein-displaced activity would be useful for BaMV to control the opposite movements between ribosome and replicase complex along the viral RNA. Cellular DExH proteins RIG-I and MDA5 can even sense the presence of viral RNA in cytoplasm and initiate antiviral cellular responses (Pichlmair et al., 2006, Yoneyama et al., 2004\n, 2005). With the potential versatility of helicases, it is not surprising to discover that the BaMV helicase-like domain may be involved in various biological functions, including 5\u2032-cap formation, replication, and viral movement.

The released peptide in the supernatant was recovered after a 5 min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and dried in a speed vacuum. After being dissolved in 0.1% formic acid, the sample was purified with Ziptip (Millipore). A parallel treatment without the addition of formaldehyde was carried out as a background control.
