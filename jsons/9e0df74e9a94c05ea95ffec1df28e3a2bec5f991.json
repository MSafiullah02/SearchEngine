            "text": "We aimed to review the history of the introduction and colonization of the raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides in Europe, the features behind its successful expansion and its impact on native fauna. The raccoon dog quickly colonized new areas after being introduced to the European part of the former Soviet Union. Today it is widespread in Northern and Eastern Europe and is still spreading in Central Europe. Features behind its success include its adaptability, high reproductive potential, omnivory, hibernation in northern areas, multiple introductions with > 9000 individuals from different localities, and tendency to wander enabling gene flow between populations. Firm evidence of the raccoon dog's negative impact on native fauna, such as a reduction in bird populations, is still scarce. Raccoon dogs may destroy waterfowl nests, although a nest predation study in Latvia did not confirm this. Predator removal studies in Finland suggested that the raccoon dog's impact on game birds is smaller than expected. However, raccoon dogs may have caused local extinction of frog populations, especially on islands. Raccoon dogs may compete with other carnivores for food, for example for carrion in winter, or for the best habitat patches. In northern Europe potential competitors include the red fox Vulpes vulpes and the badger Meles meles, but studies of their diets or habitat preferences do not indicate severe competition. The raccoon dog is an important vector of diseases and parasites, such as rabies, Echinococcus multilocularis and Trichinella spp. and this is no doubt the most severe consequence arising from the spread of this alien species in Europe [Current Zoology 57 (5): 584-598, 2011].",

In its native range the winters are cold with thick snow cover, and raccoon dogs are forced to hibernate. It has thick winter fur and accumulates large fat deposits in autumn to survive through the harsh winter (Stroganov, 1969) .

(2010) , a combination of factors including multiple translocations with use of individuals from different geographical areas, secondary contact and admixture of two co-occurring separate maternal lineages with divergent evolutionary histories are probably the main determinants of the genetic variability of raccoon dogs in Europe. It was probably a sequential, two-step process that included reduction in genetic variation due to the founder effect and population bottlenecks during initial introductions in the European part of the former Soviet Union in 1929-1955, followed by an increase in genetic variation by hybridization of individuals from multiple native-range sources representing divergent haplogroups (Pitra et al., 2010) . However, according to Ansorge et al. (2009) there was no indication of the founder effect or inbreeding in the European populations, indicated by the same level of variability that can be seen in the native Amursk population. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis indicates different invasion corridors of the species in the western range of raccoon dog distribution in Central Europe, as earlier suggested by Ansorge et al. (2009) , with the secondary contact zone between previously geographically and genetically different source populations in Germany (Pitra et al., 2010) .",

Raccoon dogs are monogamous and the male participates in pup-rearing by warming and guarding the pups when the female is foraging (Ikeda, 1983; Yamamoto, 1987; Kauhala et al., 1998b; Drygala et al., 2008a) .

Raccoon dogs thus produce many pups, but most of them die early in their life, and the mortality rate of juveniles is the major mortality factor of the species. The mortality rate is lowest (ca. 43%) among middle-aged (2-4 year old) raccoon dogs and increases after 5 years of age. Only one per cent of individuals reach the age of 5 years, with the maximum life span being about 8 years .

Fattening in autumn and sleeping in winter are regulated by hormonal changes . Thyroid hormone levels are low during winter and the animal thus adapts its general metabolism to the availability and requirements of energy (Korhonen, 1987 1 ).

After introduction in Europe, raccoon dogs wandered as far as 300 km in a year (Nasimovi\u010d and Isakov, 1985) or 500 km within three years (Nowak, 1973) . Adults may disperse in a colonizing population (Sutor, 2008) whereas in stable populations only juveniles usually disperse (Nasimovi\u010d and Isakov, 1985; Kauhala et al., 1993b; Kauhala and Helle, 1994) . The mean dispersal distances, estimated on the basis of home range sizes, were 14 km for females and 19 km for males in south-east Finland, with the mean maximum distances being 48 km and 71 km respectively . The maximum straight line distance in a couple of months was 145 km in southern Finland (Kauhala and Helle, 1994) . In north-east Germany, the mean and maximum dispersal distances of both sexes were 13.5 km and 91 km respectively (Drygala et al., 2010) . Very little is still known about dispersal routes and more research on the subject is required. The successful expansion of raccoon dogs in Europe was also possible due to the secretiveness of the species and low persecution at the beginning of invasion. Raccoon dogs are nocturnal animals, utilising mainly wet habitats covered with dense vegetation and showing inactivity in winter. These facts decrease their vulnerability to persecution Kowalczyk et al., 2008) . In many countries the species was only persecuted once it had successfully established its population. In some areas hunters are not very interested in hunting raccoon dogs because the fur of wild animals has low value.",

Ivanova (1962) found remains of birds (mainly water birds) in 45% of raccoon dog scats collected in a river valley in Voronez. When the raccoon dog population increased rapidly in Russia, it was thought to be very harmful but, according to Lavrov (1971) , this was not based on fact. Raccoon dogs were accused of causing the decline of grouse populations even in areas where raccoon dogs did not occur (Lavrov, 1971 ).

The most frequently removed predators in the area were red foxes and pine martens Martes martes.

Furthermore, the breeding success of ducks improved in the predator protection area of southern Finland during the experiment (Kauhala, 2004) . In the predator removal area chick production declined at the end of the study with a simultaneously increasing fox population. The most frequently removed predators in this area were raccoon dogs, which may have resulted in an increase in fox populations which, in turn, may have affected the breeding success of ducks.

Furthermore, chick production of, for example, mallards Anas platyrhynchos and coots Fulica atra, increased at first but then declined after the second year of raccoon dog removal. This happened simultaneously with the decline in the raccoon dog index. These results resemble those of the predator removal study described above and probably relate to the interactions between different predators.

This competition can be so severe that the increasing raccoon dog population appears to have caused a decline in native carnivore populations, including the red fox, brown bear Ursus arctos and pine marten. The polecat Mustela putorius has probably suffered most from competition with raccoon dogs (Sidorovich et al., 2000) . This information is, however, based only on correlative data and firm evidence is lacking. However, in Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, the rate of food niche overlap was very high (59%) among raccoon dogs and polecats in spring and autumn (J\u0119drzejewska and J\u0119drzejewski, 1998) .

Correlative data from Finland showed that when raccoon dogs were heavily hunted and their population decreased, the fox population started to increase (Kauhala, 2004) . This may be a coincidence, but it can also indicate that raccoon dogs and red foxes compete for some resources in Finland. In southern Finland, there was some overlap in the diet of raccoon dogs, badgers and foxes but differences also existed: the badger consumed more invertebrates and the fox more mammals and birds than the raccoon dog (Kauhala et al., 1998a) . Furthermore, female foxes in Finland have become more carnivorous after the arrival of the raccoon dog, as revealed by a study on dental morphology (Viranta and Kauhala, 2011) . This case of character displacement points to the conclusion that foxes and raccoon dogs have competed for food resources in Finland. However, in winter when food is scarcest both raccoon dogs and badgers hibernate and, hence, no competition for food between the raccoon dog and other carnivores exists in this season in northern areas.",

Seventythree percent of the observed rabies cases were in raccoon dogs during an epizootic of sylvatic rabies in Finland in -1989 (Nyberg et al., 1990 Westerling, 1991; Westerling et al., 2004) . In the Baltic States as well, the raccoon dog is an important secondary host of rabies: the number of observed rabies cases in raccoon dogs in 2009 was 24 in Estonia and 28 in Lithuania (WHO, 2009) . The corresponding figures for fox cases were 24 and 17. In Lithuania, the prevalence of rabies in raccoon dogs increased almost 2.5 times from 11.8% in 1994 to 28.9% in 2004 28.9% in (Ma\u010diulskis et al., 2006 . In Russia, Belarus and Ukraine rabies also occurred in raccoon dogs in 2009 (WHO, 2009) . In Poland, the raccoon dog is the second (after red fox) most important vector of rabies among wild animals. north-eastern Poland (24,000 km 2 ), 131 cases of rabies were recorded in raccoon dogs (Siemionek et al., 2007) . When oral vaccination was used, the number of rabies cases in raccoon dogs in Poland declined to 7\u221215 in the whole country (Smreczak et al., 2006 (Smreczak et al., , 2007 (Smreczak et al., , 2008 Smreczak and \u017bmudzi\u0144ski, 2009) .",

The increasing raccoon dog population may, however, alter the situation: the current strategies to control wildlife rabies may not be effective enough in a community of two important vector species; the red fox and the raccoon dog Singer et al., 2009) .The hibernation of the raccoon dog may further complicate the situation (Schneider et al., 1988) . Indeed, a modelling study showed that epizootics in the community of two species were stronger than expected for single species (Singer et al., 2009) . Rabies could persist in the community, even if the disease was not spreading in an individual vector species due to low density. In the community of two vector species raccoon dogs were usually the major rabies host, and the number of cases in fox populations depended on raccoon dog density. When raccoon dog density was high, invasive raccoon dogs could even outcompete native foxes (Singer et al., 2009) . Additionally, badgers may act as a spill-over species and suffer from rabies epizootics.",

In Poland prevalence in raccoon dogs was 8% (Machnicka-Rowi\u0144ska et al., 2002) . Due to high densities of the species in some areas of the country, it is a serious source of infection. In northern Brandenburg, Germany, prevalence in raccoon dogs was 6.3%-12.0% (S. Schwarz et al., unpubl. data). The parasite is an increasing public health concern, because efficient control measures are not available (Eckert et al., 2000) . However, baiting foxes in an urban area of Zurich using baits with praziquantel (an antihelminthic) has decreased the prevalence of E. multilocularis in the city (Hegglin et al., 2003 .",

The prevalence and risk of infection in wild animals (e.g., foxes) is lower in northern than in southern Finland, probably due to the sparse raccoon dog population in the north. The prevalence in foxes has increased simultaneously since the 1960s along with the increase in the raccoon dog population in Finland (Oivanen et al., 2002) . Prevalence in foxes is much higher (44%) in Estonia where raccoon dogs are more common than in Sweden (10%) where raccoon dogs are sparse (Oivanen et al., 2002) .

This is no doubt the most severe consequence of the colonization of this alien species in Europe. Since it is continuing its expansion as well as increasing in numbers in some areas where the population has been established, control measures against rabies must be reviewed. As cold climates with harsh winters are probably limiting raccoon dog distribution, they may benefit from global warming and disperse further north. As the species is widely distributed and numerous, it is impossible to eradicate.",
