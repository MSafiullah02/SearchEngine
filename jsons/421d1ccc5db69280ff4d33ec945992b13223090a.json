An RMA follows the same general framework methodology of a Meta-Analysis, but leverages technology at every step, yielding a much faster time-to-production. Some data quality may be compromised due to the emphasis on fast time-to-production, but the ability to generate answers so quickly may warrant this trade off. This article introduces RMA by way of practical example. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been available since the 1950s 2 and has been used to treat malaria, lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Most recently, has been highlighted as a potential intervention to support patients with Covid-19. While the efficacy outcomes of hydroxychloroquine are different in each clinical condition for which it is used, adverse events tend to be consistent. In this study, we use RMA to answer a specific clinical question regarding HCQ and the degree to which ocular toxicity is a side effect. This is an important clinical question, yet the authors could not find a suitable aggregation of results. Therefore, we leveraged the Evid Science clinical-outcomes database to produce an RMA in order to find relevant studies, screen to those focused on HCQ and vision issues, and then perform the meta-analysis computation. The data for the RMA is provided in Table 1 . Based on results from 11 studies (N = 3,585), we expect to see major eye issues 3.4% of the time (95% CI: 1.11-9.96%). We note high heterogeneity across the studies (I 2 is 97%) so we caution when interpreting these results.

While the results raise further questions that need to be considered (e.g., regarding the high heterogeneity), they do bring attention to an important clinical issue with the drug hydroxychloroquine. And importantly, the whole assessment was done in less than 30 minutes.",
