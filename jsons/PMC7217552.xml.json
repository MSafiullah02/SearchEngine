            "text": "Heterogeneity, whether in the nature of the components or the pattern of connections, is a key characteristic of complex systems. This is particularly evident in the case of the spreading of a disease in a networked population, where the inclusion of structural heterogeneity has long been known to radically change the process's critical behavior [1\u20136]. As an illustration, consider two classical contagion models, the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models. On a homogeneous network, they both present a nonvanishing critical point [5,6]. However, the introduction of structural heterogeneity, in the form of broad degree distributions of the nodes, can result in a vanishing critical point [1,5\u20137]. More specifically, in the thermodynamic limit, a divergence of the second moment of the degree distribution [1,5,6,8] or a divergence in the maximum degree [1,5,6,8] implies a vanishing critical infectivity. This in turn has important practical implications for real-world networks, because many of them display very broad [7\u20139] (or even scale-free) degree distributions [10]. References [11\u201318] considered, in contrast, homogeneous structures but accounted for arbitrary times in the state transitions. Interestingly, previous works studied models characterized by a series of infected states (without a biological interpretation) that described the global behavior accurately [12\u201315,17]. Notably, the model proposed in [12] is general, but each transition has an assigned function, which complicates the model, making its practical use limited. These works encounter, however, a fundamental limitation, because they describe the population at the mean-field level [11\u201318]. While structural and dynamical heterogeneities are independently accounted for, modeling both types of heterogeneities together has received considerably less attention until recently. Indeed, it was mainly studied for the SIR model: A message-passing formalism was proposed in [19,20] and a heterogeneous mean-field approach in [21]. In the latter, the authors also performed numerical experiments showing that the population can be more vulnerable in the scenario with dynamical heterogeneity. More recently, this problem was investigated on temporal networks [22] using an SIS process, which was described within the quenched mean-field (QMF) formalism and mainly focusing on spreading rates [23,24]. A similar approach was considered in [25], where however the authors highlighted a different aspect, i.e., the allocation of resources during an outbreak.",

Heterogeneous recovery rate distributions can be associated with biological differences between individuals [26,27], demographic characteristics [28], and social differences that result in nonhomogeneous access to the health system [29]. Additionally, we also consider the case in which correlations arise between the structure and dynamics. We show, both analytically and numerically, that such correlations can induce opposing and unexpected dynamical outcomes, for example, power-law (PL) networks displaying nonvanishing critical points and conversely homogeneous networks displaying vanishing critical points. Indeed, we show that the standard QMF predictions, which are a lower bound in the standard scenario, no longer provide such a bound in the heterogeneous rate case. We then propose a simple formulation to overcome this and provide a different lower bound for the process. Our results complement previous evidence on the SIR model [21] and imply that proper characterization of the dynamical parameters is of utmost importance not only for a better understanding of spreading processes, but also for many practical applications, such as surveillance, forecasting, resource management, and network reconstruction, among many others.",

These connections can be represented as a network and are described by the network's (usually symmetric) adjacency matrix A. Each individual can be in one of two states: (i) infected (Yi=1) or (ii) susceptible (Xi=1). Using a Markovian approach, the epidemic process is modeled as a collection of independent Poisson processes. In order to model the spreading of the disease through the network of contacts, with each directed edge i\u223cj, emanating from the infected individual i, we associate a Poisson process with rate \u03bbij, N\u03bbij(t) (whose transitions are Yi+Xj\u2192Yi+Yj). Additionally, with each infected individual, we associate a Poisson process with rate \u03b4i, N\u03b4i(t), modeling the recovery (Yi\u2192Xi). This system is statistically described using the order parameter \u03c1 and the susceptibility \u03c7, defined as\n(1)\u03c1=1N\u2211iN\u2329Yi\u232a,\u03c7=\u2329nI2\u232a\u2212\u2329nI\u232a2\u2329nI\u232a,where nI is the number of infected individuals. Both quantities can be directly estimated using Monte Carlo methods, in particular, the quasistationary method and the Gillespie algorithm, where each of the processes mentioned above is simulated, and the state of the nodes is evaluated [6].",

Defining yi=\u2329Yi\u232a, the process is described as\n(2)dyidt=\u2212\u03b4iyi+(1\u2212yi)\u2211j\u03bbijAijyj.Thus, defining \u0394ii=\u03b4i, W=\u03bbij, and Q=\u0394\u22121(A\u2218W), the critical point is given as\n(3)\u03bbcQMF=[\u039bmax(Q)]\u22121,where \u039bmax(Q) is the leading eigenvalue of Q. Note that the elements of Q are the expected number of contacts before recovery. Obviously, the critical point simplifies to \u03c4cQMF,std=(\u03bb\u03b4)c=[\u039bmax(A)]\u22121 in the homogeneous case, i.e., when \u03b4i=\u03b4 and \u03bbij=\u03bb. Thus, in the thermodynamic limit, the critical point for PL networks goes to zero if the maximum degree is a growing function of the network size [5,6,8]. On the other hand, we can consider a scenario that is equivalent to the contact process (CP) by setting the spreading rates as \u03bbij=\u03bbki, which is thus described by the probability transition matrix Pij=Aijki. In this case, the critical point is finite and \u03c4cQMF,CP=1, regardless of the underlying structure. Note that, similarly to the homogeneous case, this prediction [Eq. (3)] is an upper bound for the heterogeneous recovery rate scenario, because it relies on the independence of the random variables: If i\u223cj, then P(Yi=1|Yj=1)\u2265P(Yi=1)=yi, which implies that the nodal probability is always overestimated (see [2] for a similar argument). From here onward, we set \u03bbij=\u03bb and focus on the effect of the recovery rate distribution on the critical point. Considering an undirected network, from the matrix norm we can bound Eq. (3) using the standard QMF predictions as\n(4)min(\u03b4i)\u03c4cQMF,std\u2264\u03bbcQMF\u2264max(\u03b4i)\u03c4cQMF,std.We can see that Eq. (4) suggests that the standard QMF predictions might not be a lower bound to the alternative process. Note that the uncertainty assuming the standard QMF prediction increases as the variance also increases.",

            "text": "To further characterize the critical behavior of our model, we first consider an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) network with N=105 and \u2329k\u232a\u224810 (therefore \u03c4cQMF,std\u22480.1). This graph has a homogeneous structure and allows us to analyze the structural and dynamical effects independently. Mounting evidence shows that infectious times in real epidemics follow a gamma distribution [17,30,31]. Consequently, the rate distribution must follow an inverse-gamma distribution. We impose therefore the recovery rates to have an inverse-gamma distribution \u03b4\u223c\u0393\u22121(\u03b1,\u03b2), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the shape and scale parameters, respectively. Its mean is \u2329\u03b4i\u232a=\u03b2\u03b1\u22121 and its variance is Var(\u03b4i)=\u03b22(\u03b1\u22121)2(\u03b1\u22122) for \u03b1>2. To facilitate the comparison between different distributions, we restrict the distributions to unitary mean. In Fig. 1 we present the critical behavior of an ER network for different shapes \u03b1. The top inset emphasizes the behavior of the predicted critical point as a function of \u03b1 and its comparison with estimations from Monte Carlo simulations. As expected, for sufficiently large values of \u03b1, the dynamics behave similarly to the standard SIS model with uniform \u03b4, where the predicted threshold coincides (dashed line in the top inset). The agreement between analytical and simulated critical points is excellent, as it can be seen in the bottom inset of Fig. 1. Furthermore, as \u03b1 decreases, the variance of \u03b4 and consequently the uncertainty of the bounds are also enlarged. However, we observed that the critical point systematically moved towards zero in our simulations, which is also consistent with Eq. (4). Note that the inverse-gamma distribution is asymmetric with respect to its average and centered at \u03b4i\u2264\u2329\u03b4i\u232a. This implies that the bounds in Eq. (4) are also asymmetric. Since the recovery rates are sampled from this distribution, we expect that the number of individuals that take longer to recover is greater than the number of individuals that recover fast. This suggests that, via infection/reinfection mechanisms, the disease can survive for lower values of \u03bb as compared to the standard QMF predictions. In addition to the critical properties, we also show a different supercritical behavior; for example, the low-\u03b1 regime of a network can be similar to, and even in some regions it can be mistaken for, the high-\u03b1 regime on top of a network with a different structure. This multiplicity of supercritical behaviors also raises questions in network reconstruction models based on disease dynamics.",

From the Gershgorin circle theorem we know that every eigenvalue of Q lies at least in one of the disks D(Qii,Ri) centered in Qii with a radius given as Ri=\u2211i\u2260j|Qij|. Therefore, considering a symmetric matrix, |\u039bk|\u2264Qii+Rk, hence \u039bmax\u2264\u2225Q\u2225\u221e, where the infinity norm is defined as\n(5)\u2225Q\u2225\u221e=max1\u2264i\u2264N\u2211j=1NAij\u03b4i=max1\u2264i\u2264Nki\u03b4i.If the structure and the dynamics are correlated, Eq. (5) might give us further insight. For instance, for the PL case, the leading eigenvalue of A diverges in the thermodynamic limit, leading to a vanishing critical point. Conversely, using Eq. (5) and a proper choice of \u03b4i, we can change this behavior. In fact, assuming that \u03b4i(ki)\u221dki in the thermodynamic limit, we have\n(6)limN\u2192\u221e\u2225Q\u2225\u221e=limN\u2192\u221emax1\u2264i\u2264Nki\u03b4i=c,where c<\u221e is a finite real constant. This radically changes the critical behavior of the dynamics.

For comparison, the results for the CP are reported in Appendix E. We remark that the convergence towards the critical value for growing N seems to be slower in the CP case.

We observe that for \u03b3=2.7 and 3.5 the underlying structure plays an important role, suggesting a nonvanishing critical point or considerable reduction in the scaling exponent [see Fig. 3(b) inset, where both curves have a slope close to zero]. However, for \u03b3=2.1 our results indicate the existence of a vanishing critical point [see Fig. 3(b) inset]. It seems reasonable to hypothesize that the scenario observed when \u03b3=2.1 is due to the fact that, in the steady state, the infection probabilities are inversely proportional to the nodal recovery rates and thus that the evaluation of the recovery time at both ends of every edge enables an infection-reinfection mechanism. Understanding what the necessary and sufficient conditions to observe such a mechanism are and the interplay between structure and dynamics requires, however, further exploration.",

Note that for uncorrelated power laws, this coincides with the different regimes of leading eigenvector localization [37] [for the analysis of the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the leading eigenvector of Q we refer the reader to Appendix F]. Thus, we conjecture that it may be possible to alter these structural mechanisms with a proper recovery rate distribution, possibly considering dynamics-structure correlations. Note that we implicitly showed [Fig. 3(a)] how to transform k-core (\u03b3=2.1) and hub-activated (\u03b3=2.7,3.5) mechanisms into a collective behavior phenomenology. Importantly, our findings may lead to alternative prevention/intervention techniques that take advantage of the phenomenology reported here. We also highlight that the consequences of our findings are not limited to the cases explored here. For instance, it is natural to conjecture the existence of Griffith's phase in our setup. In this type of transition, we have an extended critical region instead of a single critical point, which was studied in complex networks in [36,38\u201342]. More specifically, in [39] the authors showed that slow dynamics on a weighed treelike structure can occur in a contact process. Its similarities to our scenario thus suggest that similar phenomenology is also possible in our case.",

We showed that dynamical heterogeneity is as significant as structural heterogeneity and that it can induce drastic changes in the SIS critical properties. Furthermore, our results show that the standard QMF approach does not provide a lower bound for the heterogeneous case anymore. To solve this inconsistency, we proposed a solution that relates the structural and dynamical features via the spectral properties of a different matrix Q. This formulation presents opportunities for future research. For example, our findings raise questions about the consequences of heterogeneities in spreading rates and the interplay between spreading and recovery rates. Furthermore, with regard to control/containment strategies, heterogeneity in the recovery rates can be considered for intervention strategies (or even immunization, \u03b4i\u21920). In contrast, heterogeneity of spreading rates would be related to prevention. In this context, our findings might also be of potential interest. In addition to the specific conclusions drawn here, there are others that concern more general aspects of disease spreading processes as well as the characterization of complex systems in general. For instance, differences in the localization properties induced by dynamical heterogeneities might influence the predictability of complex systems, and in particular of diseases [43], or in the reconstruction of networks from the dynamics as proposed in [44]. Finally, we also stress that our results might also have an impact on information spreading processes since individuals have different activity timescales, which could ultimately be related to the recovery time distribution.",
