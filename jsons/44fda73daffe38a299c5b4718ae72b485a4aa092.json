These products do not generally contain preservatives or antimicrobial agents and rarely undergo any heat processing prior to consumption. For many years raw fruits and vegetables have been implicated as vehicles for transmission of infectious micro-organisms. Although fresh produce can support the growth and/or survival of many pathogenic bacteria there is little published information on the stability of human pathogenic viruses on these food products. Viruses cannot grow in or on foods but may sometimes be present on fresh produce as a result of faecal contamination. This contamination can arise at source in the growth and harvesting area from contact with polluted water and inadequately or untreated sewage sludge used for irrigation and fertilization. Alternatively, fruits or vegetables handled by an infected person might become contaminated with virus and transmit infection. The most frequently reported foodborne viral infections are viral gastroenteritis and hepatitis A: both have been associated with the consumption of fresh fruit or vegetables.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SUMMARY"}, {"text": "In recent years it has been recognized that viruses are an important cause of foodborne disease.

Hence information and experimental studies on survival and recovery of viruses from foods often relates to other virus types that are readily cultured. Some of these viruses may be good models for important foodborne viral pathogens, but others may have widely differing characteristics. Enteroviruses, such as Coxsackieviruses and vaccine strains of poliovirus, have been used particularly. They infect via the gastrointestinal tract, occur in the environment as a result of sewage contamination and are relatively stable.

Viral gastroenteritis is a relatively mild disease and most people do not consult a medical practitioner; hence, the majority of cases are not investigated and are not reported. A recent national study funded by the Department of Health of infectious intestinal disease (IID) in the community indicated that for every case of IID detected by national laboratory surveillance, there are 136 cases in the community. The study also concluded that a smaller proportion of cases due to common viral pathogens are reported than cases due to common bacterial pathogens (Wheeler et al. 1999; Food Standards Agency, 2000) . Viral gastroenteritis has a short incubation period of 1\u00b14 days depending on the type of virus. This means that when cases are investigated, the possibility of foodborne transmission is likely to be considered. In contrast, hepatitis A is often a more severe disease and is more likely to be reported.

This group of viruses infects all age groups. There is a variable incubation period of 12\u00b1 60 h, which is thought to be dose-dependent. It occurs all year round, although in temperate climates most infections occur over the winter months. These viruses are responsible for both sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in the community and for outbreaks in schools, hospitals, old people's homes, hotels and cruise ships. The national IID study indicated that viruses are the most common cause of IID in the community, with NLV the most frequently reported organism (Wheeler et al. 1999; Food Standards Agency, 2000) . From 1992 to 1997, NLVs accounted for one-third of all gastroenteritis outbreaks reported to the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) and the number of outbreaks of NLV gastroenteritis exceeded the number of outbreaks of salmonellosis. Unlike the salmonellosis outbreaks, however, only 6% of the NLV outbreaks were known to be food or waterborne (Appleton, 2000) . The virus is extremely infectious and secondary cases are a characteristic feature of foodborne outbreaks. Therefore, it is not always possible to determine whether illness is acquired from a foodborne source or by person-to-person transmission (see Table 1 ). This accounts partly for underrecognition of the extent of foodborne transmission of these viruses.

The \u00aerst virus originated from the town of Norwalk in the United States, and became the prototype of the group. The name small roundstructured virus (SRSV), which describes the morphology of the virus particle (Caul and Appleton 1982, Appleton, 2000) , was used in the United Kingdom and elsewhere until recently. It has now been agreed informally by virologists working with this group to adopt the name Norwalk-like virus, for the present, so as to bring some conformity to the nomenclature of these viruses. However, formal names have not yet been agreed by the International Committee on Virus Nomenclature. The NLVs form a complex group of viruses. They have formally been classi\u00aeed with the Caliciviridae and are often referred to as human caliciviruses. They are split into two broad genogroups. Most viruses in these two groups have the typical morphology of a 30\u00b135 nm diameter particle with an amorphous surface and ragged outline, as originally described for the SRSV group (Caul and Appleton 1982) . Within the Caliciviridae there is a second genus of human gastroenteritis viruses, provisionally named Sapporo-like viruses (SLVs). The SLVs have the morphology of classical caliciviruses and are genomically distinct from the NLVs . On sequencing, some strains with There are suggestions that the epidemiology of SLVs differs from NLVs, in that SLVs mainly cause infections of young children. It is not clear whether SLVs are of signi\u00aecance in foodborne infections and more studies are needed to clarify their role.

There are several serotypes of human caliciviruses, which correspond broadly with the genotypic groups. Most studies have been carried out with NLVs, and indicate that immunity is complex and short-lived (Matsui and Greenberg, 2000) .

As from 31 December 1999 application of all untreated sludge on agricultural land used to grow food crops has been prohibited in the United Kingdom. Use on all agricultural land will be prohibited from the end of 2001. Untreated sludge is produced by either the primary settlement or secondary biological stages of sewage treatment. Further processing may be undertaken to produce treated sludge, resulting in improved stability and a reduction in health hazards and odour problems. (MAFF 1998) . Currently, treated sludge may be applied to land used for salad crops, but harvesting is not permitted for 30 months. Vegetables cannot be harvested for 12 months.
