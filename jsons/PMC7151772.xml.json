Many of the conventional solvents used for cleaning, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons, are considered detrimental to the environment and are increasingly subject to regulations for reduction in their use, and eventual phaseout [2], [3]. As a result, there is a continuing effort to find alternate cleaning methods to replace these solvents. One such alternative is microbial cleaning that takes advantage of naturally occurring microbes to remove a wide variety of contaminants from various surfaces. This chapter is focused on the application of microbial cleaning for removal of surface contaminants.",

Common contamination sources can include machining oils and greases, hydraulic and cleaning fluids, adhesives, waxes, human contamination, and particulates.

The cleanliness levels are based on contamination levels established in industry standard IEST-STD-CC1246D for particles from Level 1 to Level 1000 and for NVR from Level AA5 (0.1 ng/cm2) to Level J (0.025 mg/cm2) [6]. In many commercial applications, the precision cleanliness level is defined as an organic contaminant level of <10 \u00b5g of contaminant/cm2, although for many applications the requirement is set at 1 \u00b5g/cm2\n[6]. These cleanliness levels are either very desirable or are required by the function of parts such as metal devices, electronic assemblies, optical and laser components, precision mechanical parts, and computer parts.",

            "text": "There are six main groups of microbes [7].1.Archaea are a group of unicellular prokaryotic cells that sometimes produce methane during their metabolism. They are specifically adapted to a wide variety of environmental conditions by means of special types of membranes and metabolism.2.Bacteria are also unicellular prokaryotic organisms. They have a unique type of cell wall and cell membrane that distinguishes them from Archaea. They can digest hydrocarbon contaminants.3.Fungi are nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes that absorb their nutrients directly from the environment. This group includes mushrooms, molds and yeast.4.Protista are animal-like, nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes common in moist environments.5.Viruses are made up of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) and protein and have some of the characteristics of life. But they lack ribosomes (for protein synthesis), membranes, and means to generate energy, which are properties of cells.6.Microbial Mergers refer to combinations and collaborations between different microbe species.Of these microbes, only bacteria (commonly) and fungi (less commonly) have been used for remediation and removal of contaminants [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. When activated, microbes secrete enzymes which break down the contaminants. Hence, pure enzymes manufactured from different microbial strains under aseptic conditions are also used for cleaning [15], [16], [17]. Cleaning applications include parts and components cleaning, artworks, oil spills, wastewater, and household and industrial cleaning.",

Figure 4.1\nshows a life cycle diagram of the cleaning process. In a typical surface cleaning application, a cleaning fluid containing a strong surfactant/degreaser contacts the contaminated surface. The surfactant reduces the interfacial tension between the contaminant and the part surface, and separates the contaminants from the surface. A combination of microbes and nutrients is released into (and now living in) the fluid. Nutrients are generally added as part of the cleaning mix to provide emerging microbes with fortification until sufficient amounts of oil and grease have been introduced as carbon sources. The microbes secrete natural enzymes (for example, lipase [fats, oils], amylase [starches], and protease [proteins]), which cleave the molecular bonds and dissociate the hydrocarbon molecules (contaminants, like oil and grease). This action releases carbon as a source nutrient for the microbes. The microbes are activated and begin to digest the oil and grease that are subsequently absorbed through the cell wall and digested further. The contaminants are then carried by the cleaning fluid through a filtering device, where particulate matter, such as dirt, paint chips, and other items >50 \u00b5m, are retained.",

Typically, a biocatalyst contains a combination of nonionic surfactants and emulsifiers and water, as well as nutrients that are essential to microbial life. The combination of surfactants and emulsifiers acts to break up the hydrocarbon into very small globules to bring it into intimate contact with the microbes. The globules are surrounded by the enzymes, thereby increasing the rate at which they are dissociated and subsequently digested. The biocatalyst significantly increases bioavailable oxygen. This provides a catalyst for the microbes to multiply faster, resulting in more rapid, more complete bioremediation.

The powerful degreasing solutions used in cleaning applications are nonhazardous, noncorrosive, pH neutral, nonflammable, nontoxic, noncaustic, aqueous-based degreasing solutions. They are not known to cause damage to humans or the environment. When used in accordance with directions they do not create liquid hazardous wastes or produce cradle-to-grave liabilities. The manufacturers of parts washers offer degreasing solutions that work exclusively in their machines and are not recommended for use in other washers [32], [33], [34]. Similarly, the microbial blends are designed for the individual cleaning systems. The specific conditions for elimination of the hydrocarbon contaminants (oil and grease), such as specific temperatures, compensation for foam, aeration parameters, and flow rates, are optimized for the individual units. If the microbial blend is diluted or the cleaning solution composition is changed, it can severely impact the performance of the cleaner. Use of the solutions in other cleaners may affect the digestive effectiveness of the microbes, impair cleaning performance, or even damage the machine, and could void the warranty.",

Most microbes require a warm environment to survive and continue to digest the hydrocarbons at an optimal level to clean the solution as quickly as possible. Also, warm solution simply cleans better than cold solution.\n\u2022Aggressive chemicals, such as disinfectants, bleach, solvents, acids or chlorinated substances, should not be added to the cleaning solution since they tend to kill the microbes.\u2022The fluid should be maintained at an optimum level with solutions designed for the unit. If the microbial blend is diluted or the cleaning solution composition is changed, it can severely impact the performance of the system.\u2022The microbes need time to adapt to the type of contaminants being cleaned. If the microbe solution does not clean effectively at first, cleaning performance will improve after the microbes adapt and digest the new contaminants.\u2022Very heavily contaminated parts with excessive greases, oils and fluids should be precleaned. Sudden loading of concentrated oils and grease may harm the microbes.\u2022The filters should be replaced regularly to keep solids from building up at the bottom of the unit and decreasing cleaning performance. The trapped contaminants in the filters can also reach hazardous levels. Replacing the filters can introduce fresh cleaning solution to the existing microbe colony which keeps the system working at an optimum level.\u2022Parts should be dried after cleaning to prevent rusting or oxidation by residual fluid on the surface. A protective film should be applied to the part before storage.\u2022Environmental contaminants, such as solvents from aerosols and other sources, can harm microbe populations. Cleaning operations should be performed away from solvent sources.\n",

The proposed system effectively expresses metallothionein (mt-1) and polyphosphate kinase (ppk) genes in bacteria in order to provide high mercury resistance and accumulation, as high as 80 \u00b5M and 120 \u00b5M of mercury.

One reason for the spread of infection is incomplete or ineffective disinfection of surfaces. Many viruses, bacteria and other pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are resistant to existing conventional surface cleaning agents/disinfectants. A new antibacterial cleaning composition has been developed that contains different enzymes (proteolytic, amylolytic, lipolytic, or cellulolytic, or their mixtures) and microbes (Bacillus or Pseudomonas) together with a surfactant and an aqueous carrier to maintain a minimum 95% catalytic activity at the pH range of 5.5\u201313.5 [19]. This solution is effective against several resistant bacterial strains, such as MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus, and can be used as a cleaning and disinfecting agent in affected areas. It can also be used for killing or inactivating bacteria, viruses, or fungi to prevent spreading of the contaminants. Variations of this composition can be used for cleaning metal, ceramic, glass, or plastic parts, concrete and tile floors, cleaning grease traps, and other household cleaning applications. The contaminants that can be removed include carbon deposits, oil, grease, carbohydrates, starch, and meat and dairy products.\n",

Similarly, removal of body fluids, tissue, residual organic matter, and biofilm is critical to ensure proper cleaning and subsequent high-level disinfection. In general, these detergent formulations offer faster cleaning cycles at lower temperatures, cost savings by extending the lifetime of the instruments, and reduced risk of infections through in-depth cleaning prior to high-level disinfection/sterilization [65].",

Exposure to the outdoor environment or to uncontrolled indoor environments (temperature and relative humidity) leads to deterioration largely due to atmospheric pollution from a variety of contaminants. Deterioration is a complex process involving chemical, physical, and biological mechanisms. For example, black salt crusts form on stone surfaces as a result of the chemical and microbial interactions between the atmospheric contaminants (sulfur dioxide forming sulfuric acid), the stone (calcium carbonate reacting with sulfuric acid to form calcium sulfate), and microbes that can form calcium oxalate in the crusts. Dust and dirt combine with the calcium sulfate and oxalate, resulting in the black crust. Several microbial techniques have been proposed and successfully demonstrated for cleaning and restoration of stone buildings, frescoes, marble surfaces, and other objects [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97].

The method is based on the affinity of microbes for hydrocarbons which are digested, producing harmless carbon dioxide, water and soluble fatty acids. The microbes are nonpathogenic and safe to handle and dispose. The process is environmentally friendly and is less expensive than solvent cleaning, but it is not applicable to high-precision cleaning applications. Typical applications include parts washing; oil and grease removal from concrete and other floor surfaces, and from drains and grease traps in manufacturing facilities, hospitals, restaurants, food processing facilities, and similar locations; decontamination; cleaning of historical artworks and structures; cleaning and disinfection in health care facilities; wound debridement; controlling SRB in oil fields; mercury bioremediation; and household and institutional cleaning applications.",
