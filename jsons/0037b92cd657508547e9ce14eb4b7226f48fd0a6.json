Surveillance, in the context of health, has been defi ned as the systematic collection of data pertaining to the occurrence of specifi c diseases, the analysis and interpretation of these data, and the dissemination of consolidated and processed information to contributors, programs, and other interested persons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described surveillance as the collection of \"health related data essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for preventing and controlling disease and injury\" [ 89 ] . Surveillance systems are developed and implemented for the ultimate purpose of preventing or controlling diseases. Historically, the principles of surveillance were well described and documented by Langmuir [ 57 ] and other offi cials of the US Public Health Service, CDC [ 6 , 66 ] , and by Ra\u0161ka [ 76 , 77 ] for the World Health Organization (WHO) [ 108 ] .",

To improve data quality and timeliness of reporting, electronic transmission of surveillance data, mainly laboratory results, was initially implemented in the United States and France [ 39 , 95 ] . Early challenges included standardization of case defi nitions and reporting methods among offi cial sources.

Sir Edwin Chadwick, Secretary of the Poor Law Commission in England, used surveillance data to demonstrate that poverty and disease were associated and suggested improvement in the living conditions of the poor. In the United States, Lemuel Shattuck related living conditions to infant and maternal morbidity, mortality, and rates of death. He recommended collection of health data by such factors as age, gender, and occupation. William Farr, founder of a modern concept of surveillance, as the fi rst Compiler of Abstracts for England and Wales, set up a system that not only tracked births and deaths, but also routinely recorded cause of death by occupation. Farr developed a nosology that is the basis for the International Classifi cation of Diseases (ICD) (See http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/misc/ classifi cation_diseases2011.pdf ).",

Likewise, other surveillance systems and units were developed in response to occurrence of other epidemics. WHO established regional, national, and international control programs with surveillance as an essential component of each type of control program. While European unifi cation was anticipated, individual countries employed different approaches to surveillance; thus, there were concerns about comparability of data and coordination of activities [ 27 ] .

As a result, almost all deaths are included in the registries. Causes of death listed on the death certifi cate is dependent on the presence/absence of a physician or family member who is knowledgeable about the health of the deceased; severity of disease, complexity of the disease, associated illnesses, and whether or not an autopsy or diagnostic laboratory testing was performed. For many viral diseases, such as hantavirus, rotavirus, and infl uenza, only a small percentage of cases are fatal. However, the case fatality rate is high for other viral diseases, such as AIDS, rabies, Lassa fever, and certain hemorrhagic fevers. Thus, occurrence of viral infections is likely underestimated from the death certifi cate data. However, vital records are important to document severe complications of viral infections. In addition, surveillance from vital records can be useful for comparing viruses. For example, by 2007 in the United States, the number of deaths associated with HIV was lower than the number associated with hepatitis C [ 59 ] . Birth certifi cates are often used to monitor conditions such as congenital defects (due to rubella and cytomegalovirus infection), diseases transmitted from mother to child (e.g., hepatitis B virus infections), and other conditions of newborns that may impact immediate or long-term health status.",

The IHIE displayed the interoperability of health information exchange by incorporating clinical messaging service (DOCS 4 DOCS\u00ae) to improve communication between healthcare providers and public health agencies. With this system, clinical result messages can be forwarded to all physicians or targeted to clinical practices or specifi c geographical areas [ 90 ] . In 2009 and 2010, the DOCS 4 DOCS\u00ae public health messaging system was utilized to alert nearly all physician practices and public health agencies about H1N1 infl uenza, a syphilis outbreak, an update on rabies treatment, and new vaccination requirements for school children [ 48 ] .",

Findings from the tests are the outcomes that, when analyzed, are used to describe patterns and potentially identify factors associated with the outcomes. Seroepidemiologic studies are used worldwide to measure and characterize infectious diseases in the population. Sources of seroepidemiologic data are widely available and may be collected for other purposes (e.g., blood donor screening), but can be useful for public health purposes. In the context of viral infections, seroepidemiology serves at least three objectives: 1. To supplement surveillance data and inform immunization and public health planning programs 2. To generate hypotheses about the potential association between risk and occurrence of viral infectious diseases 3. To assess old and newly recognized viruses in different population groups Just as epidemiology is concerned with the occurrence and distribution of clinical cases in different populations, serological epidemiology is concerned with the occurrence and distribution of various components of the blood that indicate past or current infection, that are biochemical markers for certain chronic infections, or that reveal the genetic attributes of strains in various population groups. The epidemiologic characteristics are detected in the laboratory rather than at the bedside; thus, laboratory support is fundamentally necessary to conduct seroepidemiologic surveys. Fortunately, laboratory testing is a part of routine clinical care and is readily available in most countries.",

As early as 1916, the Wassermann test was applied routinely to patients attending a prenatal clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital by Williams [ 102 ] but this was more of a case-fi nding procedure than an attempt to delineate disease patterns. In 1930, the development of a neutralization test for poliomyelitis led Aycock and Kramer [ 4 ] to use the procedure to defi ne the immunity pattern of a given population; this is a landmark in the history of serum surveys. In 1932, Soper et al. [ 85 ] mapped out the occurrence of yellow fever in Brazil by antibody surveys under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation, and this technique has been widely used subsequently in studying arbovirus infections. Antibody surveys for infl uenza also date back to the mid-1930s. The discovery of swine infl uenza virus by Shope [ 83 ] in 1931 and of human infl uenza virus by Smith et al. [ 84 ] in 1933 was rapidly followed by population studies to measure antibody to these viruses among persons of different age groups [ 2 , 9 , 37 ] . The Yale Poliomyelitis Study Unit under Dr. John R. Paul employed serological survey techniques as early as 1935, and his analysis with Riordan of the poliomyelitis pattern in Alaskan Eskimos is a classic study [ 71 ] . He became one of the foremost users and promoters of the concept of serological epidemiology, and through his work and writing [ 69 , 72 ] , the utilization of this technique in public health practice and research studies has become a reality. The World Health Organization also took note of this development in 1960 and established three WHO Serum Reference Banks to practice and promote seroepidemiology in New Haven, Connecticut; Prague, Czechoslovakia; and Johannesburg, South Africa. An additional bank was established in 1971 in Tokyo, Japan. The activities and principles of these banks have been reviewed in two WHO Technical Reports [ 105 , 107 ] , in a book [ 72 ] , and in several other publications [ 70 , 73 , 81 ] . Although WHO no longer formally supports these banks, the rationale for proper collection, cataloging, and storage of specimens for use by both primary and collaborating investigators has gained wide application in public health and academic research institutions. For example, WHO collected sera from household surveys in rural areas for the evaluation of the effectiveness of penicillin in mass eradication programs for yaws [ 42 ] .",

Since the agent from which the antigen was derived could not be isolated or cultivated in the laboratory, serological surveys using immunodiffusion tests were carried out to detect its presence in the sera of different population groups and different disease entities. The results provided the sole initial evidence that this \"Australia antigen\" was associated causally with hepatitis B or \"long-incubation hepatitis\" [ 8 ] .

A series of serosurveys were conducted to cover different populations including persons attending STD clinics [ 100 ] , childbearing women [ 43 ] , and youth training programs [ 23 ] . To protect the identity of infected persons, these surveys were conducted anonymously and data were unlinked, such that notifying the person whose blood was tested was not feasible. The ethical issues discussed over time are described by Fairchild and Bayer [ 36 ] . The issues included participant consent, the participant's right to know and to control their information, and the responsibility of the health offi cials to inform the individuals of their test results. When treatment became available, serosurveys continued as long as voluntary counseling and testing was available to survey participants. As clinical data became a more complete source of similar surveillance information, the use of serosurveys became ethically indefensible [ 36 ] . Currently, in the United States, Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46.111) require that studies involving human research subjects satisfy the following rules: (a) risks to participants are minimized; (b) risks to participants are reasonable relative to anticipated benefi ts, if any, to participants, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result; (c) selection of participants is equitable (i.e., could any special problems arise when research involves vulnerable populations, such as children, pregnant women, fetuses, prisoners, mentally disabled persons, economically or educationally disadvantaged persons); (d) informed consent will be sought from each prospective participant or the participant's legally authorized representative; (e) informed consent will be appropriately documented; (f) the research plan makes adequate provisions for ensuring the safety of participants; and (g) there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of participants and to maintain the confi dentiality of data.

Using this method, and assuming the survey is conducted to meet several health information needs, the fi rst step is to plan carefully to ensure best use of resources. Sampling is conducted in several stages, starting with regions of a country, then districts within regions, then communities (e.g., villages, blocks, etc.) within the districts and households within the communities. Ideally, the community sampling framework should be a list of all the communities in the region, and there should be a measure of the population size of the community in order to sample with probability proportionate to size. This assessment is helpful because weighting at the time of analysis then becomes unnecessary. The total population divided by the number of communities to be selected determines the sampling interval, which will be used to select the communities after a random start. Also ideally, there is enumeration of the households within the selected communities such that a simple random sample can be selected. If that framework is not available, methods from the 30 \u00d7 7 Expanded Program on Immunization can be used since the selection of households is conducted in the fi eld using a central start; interviews are conducted until information on seven children aged 12-23 months are completed [ 22 , 45 ] . A slight modifi cation to the above rapid method is \"compact segment sampling,\" proposed by Milligan et al. [ 62 ] . In this method, the communities to be sampled are divided into segments of equal population size; then, one segment is randomly selected and all households in the segment are included in the sample.",

            "text": "The general principles and techniques of laboratory testing for viral infections are presented comprehensively in Chaps. 2 and 3 of this text. The antibody tests most suitable to serological surveys of specifi c viruses are detailed in each corresponding chapter of this book. The criteria for a satisfactory test include simplicity, sensitivity, specifi city, reliability, ability to detect long-lasting antibody, minimal interference from nonspecifi c inhibitors, the availability of satisfactory reagents, and the safety of the test for the laboratory technician [ 29 , 107 ] . The microtiter procedure developed by Takatsy in 1950 in Hungary and popularized in this country by Sever [ 82 ] in 1962 has become the standard method in serological survey laboratories. It is adaptable to a wide variety of antibody determinations, it requires a minimal amount of serum (usually 0.1 ml) and other ingredients, and large numbers of sera can be effi ciently tested. Several automated methods of dilution and of adding various reagents have been introduced to speed the testing even more [ 107 ] . The development of simple tests such as the enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for antibody measurement in microtiter plates has provided a sensitive method for identifi cation of antibody in serum samples from survey populations and can indicate both past and current infections [ 109 ] . The use of monoclonal antibodies in this and other antibody tests permits highly specifi c identifi cation of individual strains of the virus, a special advantage in determining whether a new strain has been introduced in a community or if reinfection or reactivation has occurred in the individual. Commercial kits for many antibodies are now available, and new formulations are continually being devised for a variety of clinical, public health, and research applications. Detection of virus and genetic characterization of viruses can be accomplished using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Handling of specimens for PCR depends on two components: the source and virus, for example, varicella zoster virus can be identifi ed in dried blood specimens, which can be stored at ambient temperature indefi nitely. In general, PCR requires specialized kits that differ for qualitative or quantitative detection. Sequencing of select regions of amplifi ed genetic material can be used to describe strains of virus circulating in a region or country; however, because of cost, these methods are frequently restricted to determine transmission during investigations of acute clusters of disease [ 1 ] .",

Advantages are listed in Table 4 .3 . Because many viral infections may be clinically mild or inapparent, laboratory confi rmation is necessary for accurate diagnosis of even overt cases. Data from serological surveys can reveal total burden of infection (apparent and inapparent), both currently and in the past. Selection of tests that refl ect antibody of long duration permits measurement of the cumulative experience of the population tested with the disease in question; selection of a test based on shortlived antibody such as immunoglobulin M (IgM) allows identifi cation of a recent infection or epidemic. Testing of two sera spaced in time permits measurement of the incidence of infection during the interval period. An important advantage of carefully planned prospective serosurveys is that participants can become a cohort for other studies. For example, to determine the frequency with which hepatitis C-infected persons in the United States were aware of their infection, the National Center for Health Statistics conducted a follow-up survey of positive cases. A full interview with these participants yielded not only awareness, but also whether they sought medical care for their infection and their knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to hepatitis C [ 25 ] . An advantage of serostudies in providing information to guide vaccination programs is that serostudies measure immunity and are likely more reliable than self-reported vaccination coverage [ 26 ] . Another advantage is that aliquots of sera from a collection can be shipped, frozen, over long distances to a number of specialized reference laboratories for testing; therefore, the work can be divided among participating laboratories.",

Unlike \"case prevalence,\" which indicates the existence of disease at the time of the survey, the presence of antibody refl ects the cumulative experience, past and present, with an infectious agent. The prevalence is a function both of prior and current infection and of the duration of the antibody tested. In contrast, antigen indicates presence of the virus at that time; in cases of latent or asymptomatic infection, it indicates prevalence of chronic infection. Many antibodies such as the neutralization antibody for poliomyelitis or yellow fever virus; antibodies to the HIV core, polymerase, and envelope; and the hemagglutination-inhibition antibody for infl uenza, parainfl uenza, rubella, measles, or arboviruses last for years, perhaps a lifetime. Thus, the cumulative experience of a population can be measured and infection acquired in childhood can be detected in persons of middle or perhaps even old age. Some waning of antibody titers (sometimes below the lowest detectable levels) may occur in older age groups after a childhood infection or vaccination. Similarly, the viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgG antibody to Epstein-Barr virus measured by the indirect immunofl uorescence test has been found to be of long duration; even complement-fi xing antibodies to cytomegalovirus, herpes viruses, or dengue virus have been found to persist for years following infection.",

Of 100 sera from children under age 10 tested, 30 % lacked protective levels of antitoxin against both diphtheria and tetanus, indicating the need for intensifying the immunization program against these diseases. The prevalence of protective levels against tetanus is a good indicator of the level of public health practice, since this antitoxin is acquired almost exclusively by immunization procedures and not through natural infection. The age distribution of antibodies to various viruses may provide useful information on the behavior of these infections in the community and of the need for immunization programs. On this basis, an active rubella immunization program was initiated in girls aged 12 years or younger. In subsequent years through 1978, a few sporadic cases were reported yearly, but no epidemic occurred [ 34 ] . Even sporadic serosurveys have demonstrated utility, for example, the researchers from the Barbados effort conducted a similar survey in St. Lucia [ 31 ] .

Females had a higher prevalence rate (5.8 %) than males (2.3 %). The adult pattern raised the possibility of sexual transmission, and this was 1988-1994 and 1999-2006 strengthened by the fi nding of a prevalence rate of 14.1 % among persons with a positive VDRL test for syphilis as compared with 3.5 % of those who were VDRL negative. There was evidence of household clustering and of vertical transmission. Advances in laboratory detection of viruses in oral fl uids allow surveillance in high-risk groups with less-invasive techniques. For example, unlinked anonymous surveillance among injection drug users seeking services in England and Wales has been ongoing since 1990 [ 88 ] . The authors found that the prevalence of hepatitis C infection decreased from 70 % in 1992 to 47 % in 1998 before rising again to 53 % in 2006. Prevalence among women injecting drug users was higher than among men, and that prevalence was highest in certain geographic areas that could be targeted for prevention.",

Some of the earliest studies were based on cohort methods using sera originally collected for evaluation of HBV vaccine, and others started afresh with a new cohort [ 50 ] . The fi ndings in the New York [ 86 ] and San Francisco cohorts [ 10 ] were as follows: (1) the prevalence level of HIV antibody was 6.6 % in New York at entry into the study in 1978, and rose to 10.6 % by 1984; (2) in San Francisco the entering prevalence was 4.5 % in 1978, but rose dramatically to 73.1 % by 1985; and (3) the rate of viral infection (seroconversion) among those lacking antibody on entry was 5.5-10.6 % per year in New York and 11.2 % in San Francisco. Among gay and bisexual men entering the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh in late 1984 and early 1985 [ 50 ] , seroprevalence ranged from 23 to 49 %. In a pattern similar to those in other cohorts, the incidence rate of new infection in the MACS, documented at 3-5 % per year in early 1985, declined rapidly during the next 3 years to about 1 % [ 52 ] . In Africa and Thailand, measurements of seroprevalence and incidence among prostitutes and other high-risk groups have repeatedly demonstrated the alarming increases that have taken place over a very few years. Transfusion-associated HIV infection systematically documented through serosurveillance of hemophiliacs and other recipients [ 3 , 54 , 55 ] , soon after known parenteral exposure, provided an important resource for comparative research on the natural history of HIV infections and the development of AIDS. Further details of serological studies of HIV infection can be found in Chap. 43 .",

Currently, our knowledge of the utilization of vaccines depends on such sources as sales records of manufactures, public clinic and physicians' data, direct interviews, and school entry surveys [ 20 ] . Because of the inadequacy of these traditional surveillance techniques in determining the need for and the effectiveness of a given vaccine, serological surveys could play an even larger role in evaluation of immunization programs.

The US military has used this approach to similar advantage. A national serosurvey of 1,547 Army recruits entering in 1989 at ages 15-24 years documented 15-21 % seronegativity for measles, mumps, and rubella; 7 % for varicella zoster virus; and 2.3, 0.6, and 14.6 % for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, respectively [ 51 ] . Likewise, a pre-vaccination survey of 1,568 US Navy and Marine entrants identifi ed important differences in susceptibility to measles; susceptibility was greatest among males, younger recruits and whites [ 87 ] . Serosurveillance has also been used effectively in the developing world for such purposes as a general assessment of success in the WHO Expanded Program on Immunization [ 35 ] and a specifi c comparison of HIV-infected and uninfected Zairian infants for responses to polio vaccine [ 80 ] . The importance of surveillance programs and serological surveys to evaluate immunization programs has long been recognized [ 30 , 47 ] . Thanks to testing of antibodies to hepatitis B that allow distinguishing immunization (where antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen are positive and antibodies to hepatitis B core are negative), from past or from chronic infection, seroprevalence in NHANES has guided the US vaccination program for hepatitis B.

Testing assays and algorithms were standardized to allow crosscountry comparisons. The authors also collected information on country-specifi c vaccination policies. Six of the ten countries reported low levels (<3 %) of antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen. Of the eight countries testing for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), Romania had the highest prevalence (5.6 %); the remaining seven countries had prevalence <1 %. Countries can apply fi ndings from such comparisons to modify and adjust their own vaccination policies.",

An example of one such possibility for molecular study is a European network for hepatitis B virus. The HepSEQ ( http:// www.hepseqresearch.org ) is a pioneering online resource for the management, characterization, and tracking of hepatitis B infection in the area. An important use will be to detect mutations of the hepatitis B virus such as those consistent with antiviral resistance [ 64 ] . This information will be helpful in identifying transmission patterns that will guide prevention efforts.",
