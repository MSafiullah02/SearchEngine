            "text": "Nitric oxide (NO) generated by NO synthase (NOS) plays an important role in physiologic and pathophysiologic processes in the lung including vasotone and bronchotone regulation, neurotransmission, immune defense, and mucin secretion (Gaston et al, 1994; Moncada et al, 1991). Three isoenzymes of NOS have been described (Gaston et al, 1994; Moncada and Higgs, 1993): the neuronal isoform bNOS (NOS-1) and an endothelial isoform eNOS (NOS-3) as constitutive isoenzymes, and a mitogen-inducible isoform iNOS (NOS-2). Cellular expression of bNOS and eNOS in different cell types of normal lung tissue and pulmonary cell cultures has been reported earlier (Kobzik et al, 1993; Shaul et al, 1994; Sherman et al, 1999). Cellular expression of iNOS in the lung parenchyma has so far only been observed after experimental endotoxin stimulation or in sections from patients suffering from inflammatory lung disease (Kobzik et al, 1993; Robbins et al, 1994; Tracey et al, 1994). However, recently all three NOS isoforms were shown by immunohistochemistry to be expressed in the developing lung, and all were assumed to contribute to NO generation functioning in normal lung physiology (Sherman et al, 1999; Xue et al, 1996). A recent study performed in human airway tissue originating from patients with bronchial carcinoma undergoing lung resection showed iNOS expression in bronchial epithelial cells (Watkins et al, 1997).",

The inducible isoform iNOS can be activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS, endotoxin) and cytokines (Kristof et al, 1998; Nakayama et al, 1992; Robbins et al, 1994) and\u2014via excess NO formation\u2014may cause inappropriate vasodilation, which is a key feature in septic organ failure (Stewart et al, 1995; Ullrich et al, 1999). In addition, iNOS-dependent excessive NO generation may induce tissue damage through the formation of peroxynitrite, and such an event has been implicated in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced lung injury (Kooy et al, 1995; van der Vliet et al, 1999; Wizemann et al, 1994). Studies in mice deficient in iNOS gene activity were shown to be more resistant to LPS-induced acute lung injury than wild-type animals (Kristof et al, 1998; Weimann et al, 1999).",

            "text": "Because of the vasodilatory effects of NO, inhalation of this agent has been used as a therapeutic approach to decrease the pulmonary vascular resistance in well-ventilated, ie, NO-accessible lung areas, and thereby improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Michael et al, 1998; Payen, 1998; Troncy et al, 1998). Unfortunately, NO inhalation, although initially improving gas exchange, did not lead to sustained improvement of oxygenation compared with conventional therapy in the hitherto performed controlled studies (Michael et al, 1998; Payen, 1998). Nonvasodilation-related effects of inhaled NO, currently not well understood, have been suggested to explain this finding. Moreover, too little information exists about the regulation of the different NOS isoenzymes, and thus the background of endogenous NO formation in ARDS and septic lung failure is still unclear (Payen, 1998). Such regulation may apparently include iNOS and enhanced expression of iNOS in several cell types such as epithelial cells (Kobzik et al, 1993; Warner et al, 1995; Watkins et al, 1997), alveolar macrophages (Kobzik et al, 1993; Tracey et al, 1994), or endothelial cells (Kobzik et al, 1993; MacNaul and Hutchinson, 1993), which has been reported in several studies in response to mitogen stimulation. In addition, regulation of eNOS and bNOS may be affected, however, only minimal information about the regulation of these constitutive isoforms in response to LPS or cytokines currently exists. Some recent evidence suggests that the activity of the constitutive eNOS may be down-regulated during inflammation (MacNaul and Hutchinson, 1993; Schwartz et al, 1997).",

In a recent study using this technique, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) was shown to be time-dependently and LPS dose-dependently up-regulated in different cells of isolated rat lungs challenged with endotoxin (Ermert et al, 2000b). Interestingly, several cell types such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) of large arteries, endothelial cells, or bronchial smooth muscle cells displayed such Cox-2 up-regulation only in the presence of plasma constituents in the buffer perfusate. This plasma dependence was correlated with the lack of expression of membrane CD14 in these cell types, again demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (Ermert et al, 2000b). Several effects of LPS are known to be mediated by the plasma protein LBP (LPS-binding protein) and the membrane receptor CD14 (Pugin et al, 1993; Tobias et al, 1989; Ulevitch, 1993). Moreover, a soluble form of CD14 has been described that forms complexes with LPS and LBP and may then bind to cells negative for membrane CD14 (Frey et al, 1992; Pugin et al, 1993). Recently, additional LPS receptors (CD55, Toll-like receptors) have been detected, which may serve as coreceptor(s) for CD14 providing an intracellular domain for signal transduction, because CD14 is void of such a domain (El Samalouti et al, 1999; Qureshi et al, 1999; Yang et al, 1998).",

A recent study (Steudel et al, 1999) reported eNOS expression in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and VSMC in normal rat lung tissue, which corresponds well with the data presented in this study. Alveolar macrophages and bronchial smooth muscle cells were, however, found to be negative for eNOS under baseline conditions in that study in contrast to the present investigation, which may be a result of different tissue treatment and embedding techniques (Steudel et al, 1999). Bronchial epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and VSMC of fully muscular vessels showed the highest staining intensity for eNOS under baseline conditions, as quantified by the currently used in situ microdensitometric method (Ermert et al, 2001). bNOS expression has been previously localized to nerve, epithelial, and endothelial cells in rat and human lung tissue (Asano et al, 1994; Kobzik et al, 1993). In addition we report here bNOS expression for alveolar macrophages and VSMC of fully muscular vessels, as well as myocytes of hilar veins. Perivascular and peribronchial macrophage-like cells, which in previous studies were shown to represent mast cells to some major extent (Ermert et al, 1998, 2000b), were shown to express bNOS but not eNOS or iNOS in nonstimulated rat lung tissue.",

In accordance with previous observations (Asano et al, 1994; Steudel et al, 1999; Tracey et al, 1994; Watkins et al, 1997), iNOS expression was noted in bronchial epithelial cells of large and small airways. Such prominent constitutive iNOS expression in the bronchial epithelium may reflect the fact that this epithelium represents a barrier with a large external surface, being naturally exposed to airborne noxious and microbial agents even in the absence of lung infection. In addition, iNOS was expressed in bronchial smooth muscle cells, myocytes of pulmonary hilar veins (this study; Steudel et al, 1999), alveolar macrophages, cells within the BALT, and VSMC of partially and fully muscular vessels (this study). Microdensitometry of immunohistochemical staining intensity showed the most intensive iNOS expression in control lungs to be present in bronchial epithelial cells of large bronchi and in myocytes of large hilar veins. Endothelial cells were found to express eNOS and bNOS but not iNOS under baseline conditions. Differential expression of NOS isoenzymes was also found in myocytes of large hilar veins, which expressed iNOS and bNOS but not eNOS in control lungs. A complex cellular pattern of NO generation via different isoenzymes thus seems to contribute to NO-dependent physiologic regulations, which were suggested to include those of vascular tone, bronchial tone, neurotransmission, or immune defense (Gaston et al, 1994; Moncada et al, 1991).",

Such NO overproduction was particularly attributed to the induction of iNOS in the lung tissue (Fujii et al, 1998; Warner et al, 1995; Wizemann et al, 1994). The current study does, however, demonstrate that the scenario is much more complex, with evidence being forwarded for a distinct regulation of both iNOS and eNOS in various lung cell types in response to endotoxin. eNOS expression was found to be down-regulated in all lung compartments, in nearly all cell types expressing this isoenzyme under baseline conditions. This was a striking finding of the present investigation, with underlying mechanisms for this type of regulatory response to endotoxin being currently unknown. In previous studies in cultured cells, a down-regulation of eNOS, triggered by increased NO production via LPS-induced iNOS expression, has been reported (Buga et al, 1993; MacNaul and Hutchinson, 1993; Schwartz et al, 1997). To our knowledge, such negative feedback regulation of eNOS expression by enhanced iNOS-derived NO formation has so far not been demonstrated in whole lung tissue but may well be operative to explain the disparate regulations of iNOS and eNOS in the present study. However, the down-regulation of eNOS in the vast majority of cell types in LPS-stimulated lungs may, of course, also be fully independent of enhanced iNOS-derived NO synthesis but may represent a direct downstream signaling event in endotoxin-exposed pulmonary cells. The underlying mechanism thus obviously deserves further elucidation.",

The present observation is basically in line with earlier findings of TNF-mediated enhanced production of NO in cultured peritoneal and intestinal mast cells (Bissonnette et al, 1991), however, NO production was at that time not attributable to a certain NOS isoform. There is inconsistent information about NOS isoenzyme expression in mast cells of different organs: positive bNOS immunoreactivity has been reported for human skin mast cells (Shimizu et al, 1997), whereas both mouse myometrial (Huang et al, 1995) and connective tissue mast cells (Bidri et al, 1997) showed iNOS expression after hormonal or antigen stimulation. Further studies should address the issue of whether the up-regulation of eNOS in response to LPS in mast cells as opposed to other cell types is a lung-specific finding or is representative for mast cells of other organ origin.",

            "text": "LPS exposure evoked increased expression of iNOS in particular in bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial smooth muscle cells, cells of the BALT, and alveolar macrophages. In the vascular system, iNOS was up-regulated in VSMC of fully muscular and partially muscular vessels and in myocytes of hilar veins. De novo expression in response to LPS, in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, was noted in endothelial cells and perivascularly located leukocytes. Increased expression of iNOS in leukocytes may well correspond to enhanced proinflammatory and cytotoxic activity of leukocytes during LPS-induced lung inflammation (Fujii et al, 1998; Liu et al, 1997). iNOS expression in pulmonary macrophages has been implicated in the regulation of the innate immunity system, which is indeed expected to respond to endotoxin challenge (Fujii et al, 1998; Liu et al, 1997). In cultured epithelial cells, increased production of NO has been observed to occur 8 to 24 hours after mitogen challenge and was associated with elevated iNOS mRNA and protein (Asano et al, 1994; Robbins et al, 1994; Watkins et al, 1997). In intact lungs, in contrast, increased concentrations of exhaled NO were reported as early as 2 to 3 hours after LPS treatment and were suggested to be an early marker of lung inflammation (Stewart et al, 1995). This study demonstrates significant increase in iNOS protein expression in bronchial epithelial cells within 1 to 2 hours after intravascular LPS application, which supports the notion that iNOS in particular contributes to excessive inflammatory NO generation in epithelial cells, and this is a very rapid response. Increase of iNOS in bronchial epithelium and alveolar macrophages has been correlated with enhanced nitrotyrosine detection, a marker for the formation of the powerful oxidant peroxynitrite, which is presumed to be largely responsible for many of the adverse effects of excessive NO generation (Beckman and Koppenol, 1996; Kristof et al, 1998; van der Vliet et al, 1999; Wizemann et al, 1994).",

Such iNOS response in the vascular system appeared thus again much earlier than was shown in cell culture studies, which reported induction of iNOS mRNA within 8 to 24 hours in LPS-treated VSMC (Johnson et al, 1994; MacNaul and Hutchinson, 1993; Nakayama et al, 1992), accompanied by significant peroxynitrite production in this cell type (Kristof et al, 1998). Excessive production of NO in the pulmonary vasculature via iNOS is thought to be a key mechanism in the pronounced systemic vasodilation of sepsis (Gaston et al, 1994, Moncada et al, 1991; Ullrich et al, 1999) and has also been implicated in sepsis-associated pulmonary edema via cytotoxic peroxynitrite formation (Hinder et al, 1999; Kristof et al, 1998). Studies in iNOS-deficient mice showed that these mice were protected from LPS-induced impairment of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and arterial oxygenation (Ullrich et al, 1999; Weimann et al, 1999) and acute lung injury (Kristof et al, 1998). Thus, inappropriate NO formation from iNOS apparently causes loss of ventilation-perfusion matching including shunt flow in the lung vasculature, and the presently described up-regulation of iNOS in both endothelial and smooth muscle cells well explains such an event in septic lungs.",

Differences of NOS isoenzyme expression were particularly noted in endothelial cells, with a baseline expression of eNOS and bNOS and an additional induction of iNOS in response to LPS stimulation. Hilar vein cardiac muscle cells displayed positive staining for bNOS and iNOS, whereas smooth muscle cells of intrapulmonary vessels were positive for all three of the isoenzymes. A different expression pattern was noted in bronchial smooth muscle cells that expressed iNOS and eNOS but not bNOS. Under physiologic conditions bNOS was the only NOS type detected in mast cells; however, in response to LPS, eNOS was found to be de novo expressed. In perivascularly localized leukocytes, iNOS was induced and up-regulated after LPS stimulation. The differential cellular expression and regulation pattern observed may be a result of different cell-specific NOS isoenzyme-dependent cell functions involved in either physiologic or pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

This is a surprising finding, because CD14-negative cell types, such as bronchial smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells of small bronchi, and large artery VSMC, showed LPS-induced Cox-2 up-regulation only in the presence of plasma constituents, with LBP and sCD14 assumed to be particularly important (Ermert et al, 2000b). LPS-induced NOS regulation may thus be suggested to engage different signal transduction pathways as compared with Cox-2 regulation in many cell types. Such a difference may include direct gene-regulatory response to endotoxin versus indirect response via LPS-induced cytokine synthesis, eg, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 (Lamas et al, 1991; Nakayama et al, 1992; Robbins et al, 1994), which may then secondarily affect regulation of target systems independent of plasma constituents.",

On the one hand, strong up-regulation of iNOS is noted in various cells of the vascular and bronchial system, which may provoke inflammatory events via peroxynitrite formation and which may affect the regulation of vascular tone, resulting in loss of ventilation-perfusion matching. On the other hand, eNOS is down-regulated in many cell types, suggesting hindrance of physiologic regulatory events with involvement of eNOS-based NO synthesis. Moreover, differential regulatory profiles as exemplified by eNOS and iNOS expression are noted in many immune-type cells. In contrast, no alteration of bNOS expression was noted in the LPS-treated lungs. Overall, the fundamental changes in cell-specific NOS regulation in response to endotoxin may well contribute to abnormalities in physiologic function in septic lung failure.",

In brief, elastic arteries and muscular and partially muscular vessels were distinguished by the structure of the vessel wall. Large arteries at the lung hilum were defined by the thickness of their muscle layer and the occurrence of elastic fibers, whereas hilar veins were identified by the cardiac muscle cells, which accompany the pulmonary veins of rats into the lung parenchyma (Hislop and Reid, 1978). A vessel was termed muscular or partially muscular when smooth muscle cells were observed in the subendothelial layer forming a muscular layer that surrounded the vessel either fully or partly, respectively. The vessels located in the preacinar regions were predominantly of a fully muscular type (associated with bronchioli and terminal bronchioli), whereas within the acinar region (associated with respiratory bronchioli and alveolar ducts) mainly partially muscular and nonmuscular vessels were found in accordance with previous data (Hislop and Reid, 1978).",
