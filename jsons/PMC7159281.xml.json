However, Huang and colleagues\u2019 report mainly focused on non-pregnant adults. The clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women is unknown. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop distinct symptoms from non-pregnant adults, whether pregnant women who have confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to die of the infection or to undergo preterm labour, and whether COVID-19 could spread vertically and pose risks to the fetus and neonate. Answers to these questions are essential for formulating the principles of obstetric treatment for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, to facilitate efforts, both in China and globally, to prevent and control COVID-19 pneumonia in children and pregnant women,3 we retrospectively collected and analysed detailed clinical data from pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. In this study we present clinical features of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and examine the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19.",

We found two articles: one titled Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, published in The Lancet, and another titled Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. We identified no published studies on pregnant women with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection.\nAdded value of this study\nWe retrospectively reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings, and chest CT scans for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in amniotic fluid, cord blood, breastmilk, and neonatal throat swab samples from six of nine patients. All nine women were in the third trimester. Seven presented with fever without chill. Other symptoms included cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two). Fetal distress occurred in two cases. Five of the nine patients had lymphopenia (<1\u00b70 \u00d7 10\u2079 cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. Nine livebirths were recorded. No severe neonatal asphyxia was observed. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8\u201310 and 5-min Apgar score of 9\u201310. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six of the nine patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all results were negative.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on data from this small group of patients, there is currently no evidence of vertical transmission in pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in the third trimester.\n",

Evidence of vertical transmission was evaluated by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in these clinical samples. Sample collection was successful in six cases (patients 2, 4\u20136, 8, and 9). Among the three patients from whom sample collection was not successful, patient 1 was diagnosed after caesarean section, thus no sample was obtained. Patients 3 and 7 underwent caesarean section at night, thus immediate sample collection was not possible. All samples were processed at the State Key Laboratory of Virology/Institute of Medical Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, for further testing. Sample collection, processing, and laboratory testing complied with WHO guidance.6 All samples, as described above, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by use of qRT-PCR with the CDC recommended Kit. The test results were confirmed by nested RT-PCR with designed primers. For the nested RT-PCR assay, total RNA was extracted from samples by use of the TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by reverse transcription by use of the one-step RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Primers were designed on the basis of the sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947).

For example, the 1918 influenza pandemic caused a mortality rate of 2\u00b76% in the overall population, but 37% among pregnant women.8 Pregnant women were reported to be at an increased risk of complications from the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection, and were more than four times more likely to be admitted to hospital than the general population (relative risk 4\u00b73 [95% CI 2\u00b73\u20137\u00b78]).9 Wong and colleagues10 also reported that around 50% of pregnant women who developed SARS were admitted to the intensive care unit, around 33% of pregnant women with SARS required mechanical ventilation, and the mortality rate was as high as 25% for these women. In the current study, we treated nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in 11 days from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 has up to 85% sequence similarity with SARS,11, 12, 13, 14 although none of our patients developed severe pneumonia or died of COVID-19 infection, we should be alert to the possibility that the disease course and prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia could follow the same trend as SARS in pregnant women.

Laboratory tests indicated that lymphopenia is also likely to occur. Additionally, increased concentrations of ALT or AST might be one of the clinical manifestations. However, none of these symptoms was present in every patient, nor were the symptoms specific to pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. By contrast, chest CT might have a high diagnostic value because of its typical images of virus infection, high accuracy with a low false negative rate, and time efficiency.

Four of the nine patients had preterm labour. However, the causes of premature birth were not related to COVID-19 pneumonia: one patient had severe pre-eclampsia, one had a history of two stillbirths, one had a history of two caesarean sections and irregular contractions; and one had premature rupture of the membrane for about 12 h and suspected intrauterine infection.

Reportedly, the pregnant woman had developed fever for 8 h and was suspected to have COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of her typical chest CT image before admission; an emergency caesarean section was subsequently done, which was followed by confirmation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, the neonate's throat swab sample was collected approximately 30 h after birth, thus providing no direct evidence for intrauterine infection. Additionally, no direct testing of intrauterine tissue samples such as amniotic fluid, cord blood, or placenta was done to confirm that the COVID-19 infection in the neonate was due to intrauterine transmission. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether or not intrauterine COVID-19 infection occurred in this particular case.
