All reports occurred in states in which rabies is enzootic in raccoons [8], [9], [10]. In the few clinical case reports that documented rabies infection of the domestic rabbit (O cuniculus), a paralytic form of the disease was observed principally. In these cases, infected rabbits had a history of being housed in an outdoor situation and had confirmed or potential exposure to wildlife [5], [11], [12], [13]. Initial signs of disease in infected rabbits have been nonspecific, including anorexia and lethargy; in one case, these were the only signs that were observed [12]. As the disease progresses, neurologic signs, including head tremors, blindness, and ascending paralysis, have been described; the affected rabbit often dies within 3 or 4 days [5], [11], [12], [13].",

Infected rabbits exhibited signs of anorexia and neurologic abnormalities, including restlessness, circling, and tonic-clonic spasms. In both cases, neurologic disease progressed to lateral recumbency at which point the animals were euthanized. On histopathology, a nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis with neural cell necrosis and intranuclear inclusion bodies was observed.

Rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus serve as the natural host for myxoma virus; in them, myxomatosis produces a benign skin disease that is associated with the development of local skin tumors that resemble fibromas at the site of viral inoculation by way of bite by mosquito or other blood-sucking insect [18]. In the European hare (Lepus europaeus), myxoma virus infection rarely has been associated with disease. Infection in the European or domesticated rabbit (O cuniculus) has been associated with systemic disease with mortality rates of up to 100% [19]; however, the presentation of disease depends greatly upon the strain of virus and the particular species of rabbit [20], [21]. Typical skin lesions that are associated with disease in the domestic rabbit include edema of the eyelids, ears, nose, anus, and genitals; blepharoconjunctivitis; hemorrhage; and nodules on the ears, head, body, and legs at the site of infection that may become congested or necrotic [17], [19], [22], [23], [24]. Histologically, the skin lesions consist of the proliferation of stellate (myxoma) mesenchymal cells surrounded by a mucinous matrix. In addition, endothelial cell proliferation, intracytoplasmic inclusions in various cell types, and epidermal cell hyperplasia or degeneration in advanced lesions may be observed [19], [22], [24], [25].",

One report described lesions that were as large as 10 mm behind the mandibular incisors [45]. Gross lesions have been noted as soon as 14 days after experimental infection and reach their maximal size after approximately 1 month; most lesions begin to regress spontaneously [45], [46], [48]. Experimental infection only has been demonstrated when the rabbits were inoculated following artificial damage to the epithelium of the tongue and oral cavity [48]. This suggests that rough or hard food, chewing on rough cage bars, or malocclusion may predispose animals to infection with the oral papillomavirus. Animals that were exposed previously to oral papillomavirus (seropositive) were resistant to reinfection [46]. The duration of this immunity is not known.",

The presence of rotaviral antibody in rabbits was shown to be age-dependent. More than 90% of neonates (<1 month), weanlings (2\u20133 months), young adults (3\u20134 months), and breeding adults (>5 months) had antibodies to rotavirus, whereas only 25% to 69% of preweanling (1\u20132 months) animals had antibodies to rotavirus [59], [60]. This corresponds with other reports that show the peak prevalences of rotaviral disease in endemically-infected rabbitries is in animals that are between 36 and 42 days old [61]. This suggests that animals become infected after maternal antibodies wane. In na\u00efve and experimentally-inoculated colonies, 1- to 2-week-old animals were the most severely affected [62], [63]. Following experimental infection, animals between 1 and 2 weeks old were the only age group that showed clinical signs.

Coronavirus was linked first to diarrhea in rabbits in Canada in 1980 when viral particles that were consistent with the Coronaviridae family were noted on electron microscopic evaluation of fecal matter from rabbits that presented with diarrhea [72]. In a survey of rabbitries from the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada, the prevalence of antibodies to rabbit enteric coronavirus (using a canine coronavirus test) ranged from 3% to 33%. Rabbitries with a high prevalence of diarrhea were more likely to have antibody titers to rabbit enteric coronavirus (RECV). The cross-reactivity with canine coronavirus (type I coronavirus) and lack of cross-reactivity with mouse hepatitis virus (type II coronavirus) suggest that RECV is a type I coronavirus [73]. Viral particles have been isolated from the feces of experimentally-infected rabbits as long as 29 days postinfection [74].",

Experimental infection has revealed that gross lesions (eg, congested small intestines and fluid cecal contents) may be noted 6 hours to 3 days postinoculation. On histopathologic examination of the small intestine, necrosis of the villous epithelial cells has been noted within 6 hours of experimental infection. By 48 hours postinoculation, small intestinal villous blunting, crypt hypertrophy, complete M-cell necrosis, and necrosis of villous epithelial cells overlying the gut-associated lymphoid tissue was noted.

Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy plays a prominent role in disease pathology; gross findings at necropsy may include blood-stained nasal discharge, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and hemorrhage on surfaces, including the pericardium and intestine [2], [81]. EBHS has been reported to affect wild and farmed hares (L timidus and L europaeus) in many European countries; similar to RHD, outbreaks of explosive disease are possible with similar clinical signs and prevalences of mortality in hares that are affected with EBHS [82], [83]. Experimental infection of domestic rabbits with EBHS calicivirus did not result in clinical disease and did not protect animals from subsequent challenge with RHD virus [84]. Outbreaks of RHD in domestic rabbits may occur rapidly owing to an incubation time of only 1 to 2 days and death in 2 to 3 days; fomites, direct contact, aerosols, insect vectors, and carcasses serve as means of spreading disease [2], [85].",

Experimental inoculation of pregnant cottontail rabbits demonstrated that this virus is not transmitted across the placenta [88].

In the European or domestic rabbit (O cuniculus), however, it can cause a fulminant disease that is known as myxomatosis (or the amyxomatous form of myxomatosis). After its initial introduction into European rabbit populations in Europe and Australia, the virus killed nearly 100% of infected animals [91]; however, the combination of selection for resistant hosts and attenuated strains of virus has greatly reduced the prevalence of mortality due to disease. A study that was performed in Spain demonstrated endemic myxomatosis in wild European rabbit populations, but found no evidence of adult mortality that was associated with this prevalence [92]. A recent study in which na\u00efve European rabbits were infected experimentally with several strains of myxoma virus provided additional evidence of the variable virulence of different strains [93]. Experimental infection of European rabbits with an attenuated form of myxoma virus resulted in transient systemic illness with orchitis and epididymitis; animals recovered from infection and demonstrated normal fertility by 60 to 90 days following infection [94]. There are occasional outbreaks of disease in domestic rabbits in the United States (most commonly California) and Mexico which are believed to represent accidental transmission from the brush rabbit (S brushmani) by way of an insect vector [95].",

Diagnosis may be performed through PCR of tissue extracts, gross or microscopic lesions, or inoculation of suspected infected tissue into susceptible rabbits [2]. Treatment consists of supportive care and prognosis varies significantly with strain and host. Vaccine development is on-going but no vaccine is marketed in the United States [96], [97].
