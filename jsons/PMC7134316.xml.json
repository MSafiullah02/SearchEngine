            "text": "The practice of teaching has undergone fundamental changes. The integration of technology for the supply of content and learning material leads to improved e-learning variants [1]. One method of so-called blended learning (BL) is the Flipped Classroom (FC). In an FC, the essential basic knowledge is supplied via online material and can be learned at home, while the in-class time can be used to train deeper understanding and application of the knowledge [2]. As the concept is rather new, much research only deals with siloed - and therefore, often heterogeneous case presentations [3]. Process models that present the development process are rare [4, 5]. Often, the FC is planned and proceeded single-handedly by the teachers. Supportive institutional structures are hardly ever available. The transformation of a traditional course is a time-consuming task [6] in which the teacher should be supported by a clear division of roles and tasks. The high amount of work involved discourages many teachers from using technology-enhanced approaches for teaching [7]. The role of the institution and its supporting duties are not defined [8]. Newly created FC design models fall too short, as they assume a high intrinsic motivation of all stakeholders. However, research has already proven a resistance to change among students, teachers, and administration [9]. Change management (CM) that accompanies stakeholders and directs the change is often missing [10]. Due to the defined lack of applicable process models that include stakeholders and motivational structure, this paper links an FC process model with a CM approach. The aim is to present the possible connections between FC development and CM integration. Doing so, we will answer the following three research questions (RQ): (1) Which CM approaches are considered in the current FC literature? (2) What tasks and recommendations to change, referred to as CM aspects, can be identified and linked to the FC development process? (3) What other CM aspects should be taken into account in a stakeholder-integrating FC development process in the future?",

We define how a successful CM can support the FC development process and foster the distribution of the tasks arising. Also, we emphasize which aspects cannot be directly assigned to the development process, but should nevertheless be considered in the sense of a successful change process. To achieve this, we have conducted a research process based on a systematic literature review described in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we will present the theoretical basis: The selected FC process model [11] as well as the underlying CM model from Kotter [12]. We then link the CM aspects derived from the literature review with both models in Sect. 4 and discuss supplementary aspects without direct reference to the FC development process in Sect. 5. Further research and limitations of our work are also covered in the section. The paper ends with a conclusion in Sect. 6. We regard the paper as a wake-up call for higher education institutions (HEI) to recognize the importance of a fundamental and managed change, involving all stakeholders, providing support and structure, and breaking down barriers.",

We searched in six databases using the search string and limiting the results from 2015 to get only current sources. After deducting duplicates in the first exclusion, we identified 282 articles of which title, abstract, and keywords were screened for relevance. Reasons for the second exclusion were a lack of relevance to CM and FC or at least BL and a lack of quality when the source was not published as a journal or conference paper. We selected 57 articles for full-text reading rejecting 50 of them during the third exclusion which we carried out taking into account the criterion lack of relevance to CM and FC/BL, lack of relevance for HEI as well as lack of application of a CM approach. Afterward, we conducted a backward/forward research determining one more article as relevant for our study. Our findings are summarized in Table 1, in which the CM approach, the mainly addressed stakeholder (Ad. ST) and the primary goals of the paper are noticed.\n",

This also corresponds to the results of other researchers for FC [17] and blended learning [18, 21]. In three of the eight articles, the well-known CM approach of Kotter was chosen. Most of the articles shown in Table 1 address the institution as a whole or at least teachers and further staff. We assume that an institutional anchoring and a distribution of tasks to clearly defined roles within the institution is needed. To identify such tasks, as well as recommendations to change, that should be considered in the FC development process, we continue to proceed our research as follows in this paper: First, we describe the FC creation process on the one hand and the CM process on the other hand. Therefore, we merge the FC process model [11] and Kotter\u2019s CM model [12], as Kotter\u2019s approach is the only one that is used in several included articles. The chosen models build the basis for assigning CM aspects derived out of the eight papers from the underlying literature review. To do so, we screened the articles for relevant CM aspects. We collected a total of 79 CM aspects, discussed the content within our team of three experienced FC researchers and assigned the aspects to the CTs of the FC process model as well as the steps of Kotter\u2019s CM model whenever possible. Doing so, we could link 46 CM aspects with both models (Sect. 4). 33 CM aspects could not be assigned to single CTs of the FC process. They were as well discussed within the team and clustered (Sect. 5).",

The attendance time of the FC is arranged differently according to the needs; the main focus is on the application of the knowledge imparted online, problem-oriented and collaborative learning as well as discussions between the students and the teacher [23]. The implementation of the FC courses is heterogeneous and scientific findings, therefore, challenging to transfer. Many researchers and users in this field wish for uniform procedure models for the creation of FC courses [24]. First models for FC design came up, which primarily concentrate on content creation [4] and student learning [25].",

As the FC process model has its roots in project management, we assume that further stakeholder can easily be included. Four successive project management phases initiation, planning, execution, and closing [26] describe the process and the activities of FC development. A supplementary checklist with CTs for each phase is shown in Table 2. During the initiation phase, the idea of the project comes up and has to be evaluated. Risks and impacts are considered for preparing the decision about the project execution. In the second phase, the planning, required resources are identified and plans for time, costs, and performance are developed. The third phase is often presented in two sections (testing and execution). Here the FC takes place. The closing phase includes an evaluation of the project and its output. Lessons learned are collected. Besides the practical implications of this model, we assume, the model profits from some enhancements to include stakeholder and their tasks from a broader perspective than the core teaching team.\n",

At the beginning of the change process, the acceptance to change from at least three-quarters of the management is critical to success for the whole change process. Excellent leaders with comprehension for the necessity of change are required. Step 2 underlines the importance of guiding coalitions, which rely on power. Numerous influential individuals are needed, breaking loose with former hierarchy structure and earlier formalities within their cooperation, working as a team \u2013 a steep challenge when they, until then, were used to reach goals on their own and therefore overlook the significance of such a coalition. Step 3 assumes responsibility to sketch and maintain the direction of change, defining a vision that is simple to communicate and easy to understand in a short time, inducing comprehension and interest and combining all single plans to a future perspective. The vision has to be spread through every communication channel, as step 4 demands. The change will fail without the support of many people, based on their trust in the change, willing to make concessions at their expense. Therefore, extensive and believable communication is indispensable, even if still not enough. Step 5 makes clear that in the following process, serious barriers to change have to be determined and removed so that people are enabled to adjust their organization on the vision. Step 6 deals with the relevance of diverse goals, that can be reached and celebrated in short steps during the change process. This short term wins have to be planned and created, e.g., to prevent people discontinuing or even start rejecting the change. However, once proclaiming a concluding triumph is dangerous, step 7 considers. In this process step, it is more advisable to go on with short term wins in broader contexts, taking care of organization parts that did not change yet, be aware of prospective recruiting and development and start new, more extensive projects. Step 8 anchors the change within the culture by communicating relevant circumstances that enabled the positive change and the resulting success and by anchoring the new approaches within the next generation [12].",

The phase includes all process steps from the first idea to the decision for or against the FC and the communication of the vision of the FC class (CT 1\u20134). Implementing CM is particularly crucial at the beginning of the FC development; Most of the CTs are closely linked to one or more steps of Kotter\u2019s CM model. At the very beginning, goals and needs for an FC (CT 1) have to be defined, which corresponds directly with the task to generate necessity for digital transformation in classrooms (step 1). The initiators should explain and justify the change [14] to all affected stakeholders at an early stage. Existing problems in teaching should be discussed in retrospect, and the need didactical change should be demonstrated [18, 20]. It is important to create awareness for the usefulness of the learning system, including the voices of industry leaders [16]. By creation an induction experience that allowed students to self-assess their needs and undertake development as required before the beginning of a course, teachers can motivate students for the FC [18]. The estimation of time, staff and expenses (CT 2) can be linked to Kotter\u2019s first step as well. From a CM perspective (step 1), Berglund et al. [14] recommend the establishment of pedagogical developers (PDs); Highly motivated teachers who work part-time as PDs to promote pedagogical development and facilitate cooperation and knowledge exchange among faculty members at the HEI [18]. The identification of all affected stakeholders (CT 3) can be linked to the first, second and fifth CM step. The FC initiators should demonstrate the benefits of FC teaching clearly and ensure teachers that support and training will be available for them and all other affected stakeholders (step 1) [16]. It is crucial to involve the relevant stakeholders for the FC transformation from an early stage. A guiding coalition should be formed, including not only teachers, students and administration but also technical support, faculty development leader and curricula designers (step 2) [17]. When involving the stakeholders, their diversity must be considered: Van Twembeke et al. found out, that teachers often feel frustrated when basic accomplishments were overlooked and not valued, especially because skills that seem self-evident for younger teachers might be hard to master for older or less digital literate teachers (step 5) [19].",

Concerning the CTs, this phase is the most extensive. First, the project team must be activated (CT 5). Together they agree on an action plan, that can be subsequently adapted into a project management document, as a BL agreement (step 1) [18]. To connect a powerful stakeholder coalition (step 2) interdisciplinary networking should be promoted within and outside of the institution [10, 19] and connections should be formed between lecturers to share and extend knowledge and best practices [19, 20]. It can help to organize workshops to create and inform the stakeholders about the FC vision [18] (step 4). Also, peer-to-peer interaction is useful [19]. Peer assessment activities through platforms and peer-reflection about teaching and learning concepts and implementations between teachers have been proven beneficial for the change process [18] (step 4). To transplant the vision of the FC approach (step 5), regular meetings of involved stakeholders should be held at the institution [19] to exchange ideas, feedback, and knowledge. Furthermore, White et al. motivate stakeholders to overcome barriers (step 5) by constantly communicating \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d FCs should be implemented and point out the advantages and possible applications of FC methods [20].

Also shared vision and agreement on how the technical system will be used in teaching is needed (step 4). Therefore, the expected effort must be realistically estimated and communicated [19]. Specifically, the support and training opportunities for teachers should be developed and offered [14]. Training that focuses on teaching in the digital environment is particularly important [15]. The combination of technical and didactical training is a distinctive feature of FC [19]. These measures are necessary to remove potential barriers in advance (step 5). This also includes providing comprehensible materials, for example, in the first language [19], so that the necessary steps for electronic teaching are easy to understand [19].

These tasks refer to the instructional design of the FC. The underlying CM literature suggests no further actions taken focusing these stages due to the strong relation to the didactical part of the FC. When the learning goals are settled, the teacher should spend some time to classify the group of learners taking the content and the different preconditions (CT 9) into account. The consideration of the diversity of the students is a key to enable the overcoming of potential barriers (step 6) [19]. Now the focus is on involving the students. They should be informed in advance about the course and the requirements (CT 10). This also includes explaining the benefits of the course. In concrete terms, former students or practitioners can advertise and explain the benefits of the classes for their future careers [18]. The course can be advertised with these strong stakeholder alliances (step 2). Students are informed comprehensively through different channels [17] (step 4) and the information about the course is provided [18]. This step also serves to overcome potential barriers (step 5). Once the learning material has been created, and the corresponding media type has been selected (CT 11), the material can be made available to the students [18]. Here it is crucial to identify and remove potential barriers that make access to the material more complicated, such as technical barriers or language barriers (step 5).",

Help structures regarding administrative activities and technical support should already be anchored. Stakeholders should already be informed at this point and follow a shared vision. New impulses from CM do not come to bear at this point. Instead, the team is now concentrating on the successful handling of the FC course.

The collection, comparison, and dissemination of research results [17] (step 8) is proper preparation of the lessons learned (CT 23) from the past course. In forums, teachers can discuss recent events retrospectively [14]. For this purpose, however, a suitable framework for these meetings must be created.

Instead, they are ongoing tasks and recommendations that should accompany the whole development process of FC thus concentrate on the management of the stakeholders. We defined the following five categories for accompanying CM aspects that should be taken into account in a stakeholder-integrating FC development process: (1) Care for the stakeholders: Make circumstances for stakeholders as pleasant as possible [16], show appreciation [19], remove barriers like insufficient time and money [19] and compensate the additional burden of time on teachers through the use of trained students [15] or the support of Ph.D. students [20] during all phases; and also note the changes in the requirements of stakeholders during the various phases. (2) Encourage teams: Create a sense of community [14] and promote the presence of the guiding coalition [19]. (3) Live the vision: Create and use a vision [20] that gets a proper name and is distributed across different communication channels [18]. Consider an FC establishment from bottom-up [19], set and communicate goals [20], use motivational techniques [18] and activate committed stakeholders [10]. (4) Offer permanent support: Form a team for support [18] and provide necessary framework conditions [10]. Offer emotional support and encourage self-confidence of teaching staff [19]. Concentrate on established technological tools [16] and support voluntary participation of teachers [15]. (5) Enable step-by-step procedure: Implement FC step-by-step [20] by starting small, flipping one lecture at a time, executing pilots and preparing subareas [17]. Set intermediate goals [19], evaluate the progress [16] communicate the first results [18], and employ feedback loops [16].

The integration of CM to an FC process model is of particular relevance for researchers from the fields of e-learning, instructional design, CM, and Process Management, especially in HEI. For further research we would welcome reports about FC development projects, that rely on our findings. Furthermore, stakeholder specific action plans should be developed and tested.
