            "text": "There have been increasing reports of dermatologic manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 . The first case series of dermatologic manifestations included 18 Italian patients with erythematous, urticarial, and vesicular rashes, often on the trunk. 1 Other reports include drug hypersensitivity, 2 urticaria, 2 a petechial rash mimicking dengue, 3 and acro-ischemia. 4 It is important to further characterize dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 in order to understand the relationship between the virus and skin, and determine whether cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 may assist with early disease detection. To date, collecting cases of dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 has been challenging given their relative infrequency and the rapid spread of COVID-19. Dermatologists are relying on informal networks, including social media, to share cutaneous manifestations of the disease. In order to rapidly and centrally collate these cases from a global network and inform colleagues on the front line combatting the virus, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) COVID-19 Task Force has launched an online COVID-19 dermatology registry. This registry was inspired by a similar registry created by the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance. 5 The registry's primary purpose is to rapidly collect COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations in order to enable prompt dissemination of the findings to the dermatology community and front line healthcare workers. Given early reports of COVID-19 disparities across racial and socioeconomic groups in the United States, we encourage submission of COVID-19 cases across all ages, races and socioeconomic statuses. A secondary objective is to report how COVID-19 affects patients with pre-existing dermatologic conditions, particularly those on immunosuppressive therapies. We expect that these results will generate ideas for further epidemiologic studies on COVID-19 in dermatology.",
