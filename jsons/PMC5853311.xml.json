Subjects were required to have a negative viral PCR test within 2 weeks of the last positive virology testing performed. If the interval between consecutive positive tests was beyond 2 weeks, strain identification was performed using both samples to confirm the strains were the same. The subjects were identified from 2 cohorts (Supplementary Figure). The first cohort included patients whose nasal samples were collected and tested for clinical purposes when respiratory symptoms were present from March 2009 through June 2016. The second cohort came from a prospective surveillance study of HCT recipients undergoing transplant from December 2005 and February 2010 [8]. Standardized respiratory symptom surveys and multiplex respiratory PCR tests were performed weekly during the first 100 days posttransplant, then every 3 months through year 1 posttransplant and whenever respiratory symptoms occurred between days 100 and 365 posttransplant. Only subjects with respiratory symptoms were selected for the current study, and no duplicated subjects were analyzed. Separately, mNGS was conducted when \u22654 positive samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values of <28 were available irrespective of presence of respiratory symptoms from the above-mentioned prospective surveillance study of HCT recipients. Demographic and clinical data were collected from the database and medical chart review. The study was approved by the Institutional Board Review at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.",

The duration of shedding was defined as time between the first positive and first negative sample. Prolonged shedding was defined as the duration of shedding \u226521 days, which was described to be a median shedding duration of HCoV during the first 100 days after HCT [6]. Highest daily steroid dose and lowest cell count in the 2 weeks prior to first HCoV detection were recorded. Conditioning regimen was categorized into myeloablative and nonmyeloablative/reduced intensity based on the definition previously described [12].",

Recent data suggest that lower respiratory tract disease caused by 4 other HCoV strains (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) was also associated with significant respiratory support and mortality in immunocompromised hosts [7]. The unmet need for the development of antiviral therapy against HCoV is expected to expand as immunocompromised populations grow. We found that initial high viral load, prior high-dose steroid use, and myeloablative conditioning were important factors associated with prolonged HCoV shedding in HCT recipients. Duration of viral shedding is often used as an endpoint at early stages of clinical trials for new antiviral drugs [20, 21]. Stratification based on risk factors is critical to avoid imbalances due to host and viral factors in randomized trials, which might otherwise mask true differences of experimental agents.",

            "text": "Genetic variability of HCoV OC43 at the community level and intrahost heterogeneity of MERS coronavirus have been reported [22\u201325]. Such variability might have important implications in viral disease pathogenesis, and the study of viral genome evolution within a host can provide vital information important in developing and assessing antiviral agents [26]. For example, development of antiviral drug resistance during individualized therapy that is associated with poor outcome has been described extensively with influenza virus [27\u201329]. Grad et al reported intrahost genome evolution of respiratory syncytial virus over time in an infant with severe combined immune deficiency who underwent a bone marrow transplant [30]. The viral population diversity dramatically increased after engraftment, which appeared to reflect dynamic response to immune pressure from host immunity. To our knowledge, no previous data exist describing how the HCoV genome evolves within a host over time. In the current study, engraftment occurred in 4 of 5 patients sequenced prior to the onset of shedding. Interestingly, no SNPs were recovered <30 days after the onset of shedding even after immune reconstitution. Variants accumulated starting at 1 month after the onset of shedding (1\u20136 changes over time), consistent with the previously estimated evolution rates of HCoV [13, 14]. Given the relatively slow evolution rate of coronaviruses, these observations could be promising from the standpoint of antiviral resistance and therapeutic development [13, 14]. Due to their exceptionally large RNA genomes, coronaviruses are known to encode highly processive polymerases as well as proofreading exoribonucleases that temper viral genome evolution relative to other RNA viruses [31\u201333]. Further epidemiological and biochemical work is required to characterize the functional impact of the variants recovered here.",

Similarly, although no particular strain appeared to be associated with prolonged shedding, strain identification using saved samples was successful in only 70% of the patients, which limited our ability to detect small difference of shedding duration among each HCoV strain. Further studies with larger sample sizes will help to clarify the distinct association between particular HCoV strains and prolonged shedding. Finally, our cohort included 4 patients who had documented HCoV shedding prior to transplant. Considering the unmeasured influence of their different backgrounds on our analyses, we separately analyzed 40 patients who started shedding after transplant. Only univariable logistic regression analysis could be performed due to the small sample size, with similar results.",

Our study provides critical information to develop antiviral therapies and design randomized trials with viral load endpoints. In addition, as the duration of shedding is an important determinant of viral infectivity and transmissibility, predictive factors for prolonged shedding may provide useful information for effective infection control, such as the expected duration of isolation. Further studies are needed to validate the risk factors including particular HCoV strain for prolonged shedding.",
