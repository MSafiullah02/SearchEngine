We will randomise 34 primary care hospitals from two counties within Guangdong province into the intervention and control arm (1:1 overall ratio) stratified by county (8:9 within-county ratio). In the control arm, antibiotic prescribing and management will continue through usual care. In the intervention arm, we will implement an antibiotic stewardship programme targeting family physicians and patients/caregivers. The family physician components include: (1) training using new operational guidelines, (2) improved management and peer-review of antibiotic prescribing, (3) improved electronic medical records and smart phone app facilitation. The patient/ caregiver component involves patient education via family physicians, leaflets and videos. The primary outcome is the proportion of prescriptions for acute respiratory infections (excluding pneumonia) that contain any antibiotic(s). Secondary outcomes will address how frequently specific classes of antibiotics are prescribed, how frequently key non-antibiotic alternatives are prescribed and the costs of consultations. We will conduct a qualitative process evaluation to explore operational questions regarding acceptability, cultural appropriateness and burden of technology use, as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis and a long-term benefit evaluation. The duration of the intervention will be 12 months, with another 24 months' post-trial long-term follow-up.",

Rising levels of antimicrobial-resistant infections may devastate our health system, costing many lives and using valuable resources [3, 4] . Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are commonly seen in primary care consultations, with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) accounting for the largest source of inappropriate antibiotic use [5, 6] . This is because most URTIs are viral and self-limiting, and the administration of antibiotics is not clinically effective at shortening duration or symptom severity [7] . Similarly, among lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), acute bronchitis is commonly viral, but up to 80% of acute bronchitis patients still receive antibiotics [8] . Bacterial respiratory infections in primary care include acute otitis media, acute sinusitis and group A streptococcal pharyngitis and pneumonia, where narrow-spectrum antibiotics should be recommended as the first choice according to US [9] and UK guidelines [10] . However, broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as macrolides and fluoroquinolones, are often given which are more likely to generate resistance [11] [12] [13] .",

This is particularly challenging in rural areas, as rural health workers have less education/training and may inappropriately prescribe more frequently [14] . A cross-sectional study in 10 provinces in Western China showed that antibiotics accounted for over half of the total prescriptions issued, and mostly for ARIs [15] . China has issued policies to regulate the use of antibiotics over the past 10 years. In 2012, the Chinese MoH issued a regulation for antibiotic prescriptions, limiting them to less than 60% of all prescriptions for inpatients and 20% for outpatients [16] . However, no operational details have been given. The policy has not been proven effective at improving appropriate antibiotic prescribing [17] . Additionally, the policy only focussed on large hospitals and neglected primary care facilities [18, 19] .",

We evaluated the intervention in a cluster-randomised controlled trial (cRCT) in Guangxi province, China, and it successfully reduced the frequency of antibiotic prescribing for childhood URTIs by 29 percentage points (95% CI \u2212 42 to \u2212 16) [25] .

Assuming feasibility and acceptability, we will then use a cRCT to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness at reducing inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for RTIs (and improving other outcomes) in outpatients of any age within public primary care facilities, in comparison to usual care (which means existing relevant standard processes only, as our previously developed intervention has only been implemented in the previous study sites).",

Each township hospital covers 50,000 to 100,000 people and typically has less than 100 beds and 20-40 family physicians. Family physicians are medical doctors who receive formal medical training for either 3 or 5 years to practice acute care, and are employed by the township hospital. Village clinics are run by one or two paramedics (called village doctors), who receive limited medical training equivalent to a high-school level, and are guided by the township hospital. Village doctors are self-employed, primarily relying on three sources of income: the consultation fees paid by the rural health insurance, the Government's public health package for preventative care, and income from private practice which is not properly documented.",

These medicines are purchased through an open bidding platform run by the Provincial Government. Village clinics have access to a much lower variety of medicines compared to township hospitals. Formally, village doctors are not allowed to prescribe antibiotics based on their practice regulations. However, in our previous work in Guangxi we found that some village doctors did actually prescribe antibiotics for common colds, and that villagers often visited village clinics for convenience but frequently got the wrong advice, which is likely to drive demand for antibiotics when they seek care for themselves or their children in township hospitals [30] .

The pilot evaluation is guided by the MRC framework for process evaluations [31] . A planning matrix, adapted from our previous trial in Guangxi, can be found in Additional file 1 that illustrates our objectives, intended topics, information required, sources of information and methods for data collection. In the intervention cluster we will conduct in-depth interviews with two family physicians, two village doctors and one township hospital director, and we will conduct one focus group discussion with patients or their caregivers. We plan to do five in-depth interviews with family physicians and one focus group discussion with two to three patients or their caregivers during the Table 1 International classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10) codes used for acute respiratory infection case definitions URTIs upper respiratory tract infections pilot study. We will administer the questionnaire to family physicians before and near the end of the pilot study period. We will also perform structured observations to record training and implementation (e.g. consultations) processes during the pilot period. Our qualitative methods adopt an interpretive description approach and we will employ thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clarke [32, 33] . We will analyse qualitative data as soon as possible after it has been collected. This approach allows for reflexive identification of themes from interviews and observations which can feed into subsequent interviews. For example, if interesting issues emerge they can be followed up in further interviews. As this is a mixedmethods pilot evaluation, our qualitative results will be analysed with our quantitative questionnaire results to provide feasibility and acceptability on both the intervention and control clusters, as well as on feasibility of meeting the sample size (of the prescriptions).",

Operational guidelines to reduce antibiotic prescribing for ARIs will be used. The guidelines will include patient symptom-based diagnostic algorithms, when to/ not to use antibiotics, and when narrow-spectrum antibiotics are preferred. Based on Chinese guidelines, chest x-ray examinations will be recommended when symptoms indicate pneumonia but clinical signs are not severe, or if a patient makes a second visit with signs indicative of pneumonia. Key health education messages during consultations with patients are also included (a) Every family physician in the township hospitals will receive an operational guideline both in printed and app-based form (b) Village doctors will receive a brief operational guide regarding appropriate use of antibiotics and referral 3. Systematic training including a half-day training workshop run by a county-level hospital senior physician and the research team will be given to family physicians and village doctors. This will involve: (a) Lectures, case discussions, role plays and Q&As on appropriate antibiotic prescribing practices for RTIs based on operational guidelines. Every family physician in the township hospitals will receive a training booklet both in printed and WeChat-app form (b) Using the WeChat app to monitor antibiotic use based on monthly reports from the EMR system to facilitate physicians' discussions (c) Communication skills training when consulting with patients and/or caregivers 4. Improved electronic prescription system in the EMR to help township hospital family physicians make appropriate decisions when treating patients for RTIs, involving: (a) Embedded modules to encourage appropriate antibiotic prescribing practice, such as pops-up of laboratory test checklists and recommended antibiotics to prescribe when prescribing (b) An alarm system will be implemented to alert the family physician about any patient who re-visits any hospital within 14 days or who has been admitted within 1 month for a respiratory infection or sepsis after their index visit. In this scenario, chest xray and blood profile examinations will be recommended and recorded 1. Currently most township hospitals have an existing antibiotic stewardship programme. However, the programmes are often not functioning because of specific targets and activities are planned/implemented. Township family physicians do already hold monthly administrative meetings, but no time is spent on antibiotic prescribing peer-review discussions 2. Township hospital family physicians will prescribe antibiotics according to existing national guide on use of antibiotics which are not specifically designed for primary care facilities, and rarely used. Most physicians prescribe based on their group practice and existing knowledge/practices. Any messages given by control-arm family physicians will be at their own discretion based on their existing practice and training 3. Township hospital family physicians receive relevant medical training before they obtain their qualifications, but only a few of them have opportunities to receive continuing training afterwards and these trainings are usually not specifically for respiratory infections or antibiotics use. We will not provide any training to control-arm family physicians 4. Township hospitals already have a similar electronic prescription system in the EMR, but there is no clinical decision module, alarm system or pop-ups for recommended and nonrecommended antibiotics. We will not make this available for control-arm hospitals Consumer side (patients/ 1. Printed educational material and WeChat-app versions describing appropriate antibiotic use for respiratory infections will be 1. There are and will be no health education materials on appropriate antibiotic use available in control-arm hospitals following set of indicators is based only on those eligible prescriptions containing at least one antibiotic: (1) the broad-spectrum antibiotic prescription rate: the proportion that contain one or more broad-spectrum antibiotics (we define broad-spectrum antibiotics as those antibiotics that act on the two major bacterial groups gram-positive and gram-negative, or any antibiotic that acts against a wide range of disease-causing bacteria); (2) the fluoroquinolone prescription rate: the proportion that contain one or more fluoroquinolone antibiotics; (3) the multiple antibiotic prescription rate: the proportion that contain two or more antibiotics of any kind; (4) the intravenously injected antibiotic prescription rate: the proportion that contain any antibiotics delivered by intravenous injection. As the intervention will address appropriate use of antibiotics for bacterial ARIs, we will also measure, taking the total number of antibiotics prescribed per township hospital as the denominator and (5) the proportion that contain any antibiotics in the Access group of the WHO's 2019 Essential Medicines List classification [35] . As all these outcomes have denominators that only include eligible prescriptions containing one or more antibiotics, when analysed they will effectively be creating 'outcome-based subgroups' that are defined post randomisation [36] . This is a common, but often unrecognised, issue that can introduce bias into the treatment-effect estimates for such outcomes. However, there are no clearly applicable/feasible solutions for our situation [36] , and so we will treat the results for these specific outcomes as exploratory. We will also collect and create the following secondary outcomes based on all eligible prescriptions. In our previous trial, we observed an increased use of Traditional Chinese Medicines, likely as alternatives to antibiotics, and a widespread misuse of glucocorticoids [17] . Thus, we will also measure: (6) the proportion containing any Traditional Chinese Medicines and (7) the proportion containing any glucocorticoids. Lastly, to evaluate if and how the intervention affects the mean cost of prescriptions issued to eligible patients we will also measure: (8) the average cost of a prescription, based on the cost of any medicines and (9) the average cost of a consultation (one per prescription), based on all costs including medicines, tests and the consultation.",

We assume that the treatment will reduce the intervention arm APR by more than 15 percentage points during the trial period, based on how effective the previous related trial was [25] , which is viewed as the minimum clinically important effect in the context of the extremely high existing APR levels. Based on our previous trial [25] we assume that the intra-cluster correlation coefficient will be 0.14 in the intervention arm and 0.09 in the control arm here, and based on our exploratory work we assume that we will be able to collect at least 500 eligible prescriptions per township hospital during the trial period, which we assume as our fixed cluster size. Based on these assumptions we estimated that we will require 17 clusters per arm to detect a 15-percentage-point or greater absolute reduction in the APR with 80% power using a two-sided hypothesis test with an alpha of 0.05 [37] . Because our previous trial data indicated potentially important county-level differences in baseline and during-trial-period APR levels and in the magnitude of the treatment effect, we also plan to stratify our randomisation by county. Therefore, this sample size also accounted for an unequal allocation ratio within strata, and, specifically given the number of clusters available in each county, it accounted for a within-county intervention-to-control allocation ratio of 8:9, which we chose in favour of the control arm for logistical purposes.",

Our PE will be based on the underlying programme theory, namely the social cognitive theory, which views behaviour change and maintenance as a dynamic and reciprocal relationship determined by the person, their environment (their external social context) and their behaviour (their response to stimuli to achieve goals) [48] . Our PE aims to offer an exploration of 'what worked, for whom and why' in the implementation of the intervention [49] . Our specific objectives for the process evaluation are: (1) to describe the health system and service delivery context in which the intervention was delivered; (2) to examine recruitment processes, both at the cluster level (township hospital) and the individual level (patient consultations and prescriptions); (3) to report on intervention fidelity, both at the cluster level (training) and the individual level (provider delivery) and (4) to explore the responses to the intervention both at the cluster level (managers and providers) and the individual level (patients). Methods will include document review (e.g. recruitment records, meeting minutes), structured observation of trainings and consultations in the township hospital, questionnaires with township hospital family physicians, and interviews of more than 50 participants including six township hospital directors, 18 township hospital family physicians, 12 village doctors and 18 patients/their caregivers, all distributed between the intervention and control arms at a ratio of 2:1. We will also observe four training sessions in the intervention arm. In addition, we will conduct 12 observations of clinical consultations in the intervention arm and six in the control arm. The sample size of the qualitative study is purposively set according to our previous trial in Guangxi and will be adjusted during the study. Our qualitative methods will be guided by an interpretive description approach, which focusses on developing knowledge to inform clinical practice [32] . We will develop a sampling frame, purposively select participants for inclusion and collect data at 3, 6 and 12 months after the start of the intervention in four clusters in the intervention arm and two clusters in the control arm.",

Despite the implementation of the National Essential Medicines Policy and Zero-Mark-Up Policy in 2009 and the Administrative Regulation for Clinical Antibiotic Use in 2012 [16] , their effects on reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing have been limited to large hospitals where the enforcement of appropriate prescribing practices is much better [53] . No change was observed in primary care facilities due to the knowledge gap in primary care providers, loose regulation enforcement and a high demand from patients [17, 18, 54] . Our previous trial in rural Guangxi proved the effectiveness and longterm benefits of educational interventions and prescribing peer-reviews in this setting [25, 26] . Based on it, this study aims to establish a more comprehensive and widely applied stewardship programme that is practical, feasible and effective, and which will then hopefully change national policy and clinical practice to benefit billions of people in China.

Universal health coverage has been achieved in Shaoguan Prefecture ensuring that every rural resident is covered.

We have not started recruiting patients and township hospitals at the time of submission. We expect to formally launch the trial in March 2020 or later when the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak comes under control in China. The pilot work has started under the local ethical approval and has finished by the time of submission. We will disseminate the trial results through research articles and policy briefs. We aim to publish our results in international leading medical journals, and present them at national and international conferences. The total lifespan of the study will be 60 months (Fig. 1) . also allow verbal consent to be given by providers if requested for interviews, to protect people working in bureaucratic health systems, and to obtain as much objective information as much. All personally identifying information will be deleted before data entry using a unique study identification number assigned. Physical hard copies of the study data materials will be stored securely in a locked cabinet, separate from the data of other studies. For the qualitative data, only the researchers conducting the study will know the names of the participants, and have access to the responses from individual participants.",
