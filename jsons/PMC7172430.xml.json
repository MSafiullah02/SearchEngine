            "text": "In the majority of patients with a poor outcome, who are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), there is an association with severe respiratory distress syndromes [1]. Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is usually attributed to bacterial agents, but the introduction of broader diagnostic panels with increased sensitivity have improved the diagnosis of respiratory viruses with a relevant impact on outcomes for ICU-patients [2]. Indeed, based on recent reports, viruses account for 11\u201355% of the total infections in patients admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory distress [1], [3], [4], [5]. However, many studies have only focused on the role of influenza A virus (e.g. H1N1pdm09) as an etiologic agent of acute respiratory failure [6], [7]. Respiratory viruses other than influenza such as human rhinovirus (HRV), human parainfluenza viruses 1-4 (hPIV1-4), human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and human coronaviruses (hCoVs) are not routinely investigated in respiratory samples of ICU patients, and their role as the cause of ICU admission might be under estimated. Understanding the etiologic agents of CAP may improve treatment decisions and patient outcome. However, despite technological advances, establishing the etiologic causes of pneumonia remains a challenge.",

            "text": "The use of multiplex molecular assays for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses in ICU patients has increased the proportion of viral infections detected [2], [16]. However, a major weakness of recent studies concerning CAP is that assessments are often performed using only URT samples. [13]. In fact, the use of URT samples for the diagnosis of CAP is controversial [3], [17]. Indeed, in studies that have analyzed paired URT and LRT samples, URT samples often resulted negative while positive results were observed in LRT samples [3], [9], [18], [19]. In addition, studies with >50% LRT samples, showed a higher (44.2%) proportion of viral infections as compared with studies analyzing the etiology of CAP using URT samples only (23.5%) [13]. The high proportion of viral infections described here could indeed be related to the greater frequency (45%) of LRT samples available for the diagnosis as compared to other studies (10\u201320%) [13]. The importance of LRT testing is also highlighted by a recent study involving ICU patients in whom URT testing failed to detect over 40% of cases of LRT-confirmed influenza [20].",

On the other hand, it was somewhat surprising that the second most frequently detected virus was rhinovirus (14.6%). A growing body of evidence has associated rhinovirus with lower respiratory tract disease both in adults [1], [3], [5], [12], [16] and children [21]. Indeed, in the present study, HRV was detected in LRT samples with a frequency (57.6%) similar to that observed for influenza (55.7%) and hRSV (61.5%). This finding provides new insights into the burden and severity of HRV infections. In addition, our data highlight the need for improved assays to identify respiratory viruses other than influenza especially in high-risk patients. More in general, this study underlines the importance of using molecular assays that cover a wide range of viruses for the diagnosis of respiratory infections.",
