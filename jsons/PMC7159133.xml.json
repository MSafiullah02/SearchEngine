            "text": "Respiratory viral infective diseases are renowned as a major threat to all ages worldwide, particularly children under 5 years of age 1. Beginning in late 2002, a severe epidemic disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China and quickly spread to more than 30 countries and areas 2, causing a significant impact on health and economy. SARS\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) typically causes respiratory and enteric diseases, pneumonia, exacerbation of asthma, neurological symptoms, and myocarditis in humans 3, 4, 5, with a mortality rate as high as nearly 10 % of those diagnosed 6. SARS\u2010CoV is a positive\u2010stranded RNA virus belonging to a family of enveloped coronaviruses 5, 7. The SARS\u2010CoV genome contains five major open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the replicase polyprotein, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane glycoproteins (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). Extensive proteolytic processing of these nonstructural and structural polyproteins is a vital step for providing the functional proteins for SARS\u2010CoV viral propagation, and such processing is mediated primarily by the nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), the main protease (Mpro) with a dimeric chymotrypsin\u2010fold, also known as 3C\u2010like protease (3CLpro) because of its analogy with the monomeric 3C protease (3Cpro) form picornavirus 8, 9, 10.",

            "text": "In contrast to the common serine proteases containing a Ser\u2010His\u2010Asp catalytic triad, SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro employs a Cys\u2010His catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) in the catalytic site. This is similar to the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 3CLpro and the human coronavirus 229E 3CLpro (HCoV 229E) using Cys144 and His41 8. According to the previous studies on the substrate specificities and proteolytic sites, SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro utilizes the substrates with bulky hydrophobic residues (mainly Leu or Ile), invariable glutamine residue, and small aliphatic residues (Ser, Ala, or Gly) at the P2, P1 and P1\u2032 positions, respectively 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. In addition, secondary structural studies for substrates of SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro have revealed that substrates with more beta\u2010sheet like structures tend to be cleaved more quickly 12. The determination of the crystal structures for HCoV 229E 3CLpro and the inhibitor complex of TGEV 3CLpro also confirmed a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate binding sites for CoV 3CLpro\n8.",

The reverse\u2010phase high\u2010pressure liquid chromatography (RP\u2010HPLC) experimental system was used to analyze cleaved products by a linear gradient of acetonitrile\u2010containing trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and to screen inhibitors, but it is a time\u2010consuming process. A fluorogenic substrate, Dabcyl\u2010KTSAVLQSGFRKME\u2010Edans, with the fluorescence quenching pair (Edans\u2010Dabcyl) has been developed to facilitate enzyme assay and inhibitor screening (Fig. 2) 14. With this or other quenching pairs, such as 2\u2010amino benzoyl\u2010(Abz)\u2010Tyr(NO2) 15, an intense increase of fluorescence was detectable upon the peptide cleavage by the protease due to the effect of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Accompanying a fluorescence plate reader, such a fluorogenic substrate can be applied to high\u2010throughput inhibitor screening. In addition, fluorogenic peptides containing a SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro consensus cleavage sequence and Rhodamine 110 [(Ala\u2010Arg\u2010Leu\u2010Gln\u2010NH)2\u2010Rhodamine] can also serve as substrates for the enzyme activity assay with high sensitivity (at low pM range) 16.",

            "text": "The protease contains three domains (I, II, and III) and the active site is located between domain I and II. The crystal structures of the 3CLpro from TGEV, HCoV 229E, and SARS\u2010CoV 8, 10, 17, 18 reveal a common feature for CoV 3CLpro with two chymotrypsin\u2010like \u03b2\u2010domains (domain I & II) and one \u03b1\u2010helical dimerization domain (domain III) which is absent from the picornavirus 3Cpro and chymotrypsin 19. In addition, deletion of the first four amino acids in the N terminus significantly increased the dimer dissociation constant (K\nD) and accordingly decreased the protease activity 20, 21. From analytic ultracentrifugation (AUC) analysis, sequential deletions of the first 3, 4, and 7 residues at the N terminus caused a 12\u2010, 205\u2010, and 1275\u2010fold increase in dimer K\nD, respectively 20, indicating the role of Arg4 in dimerization. Besides the N terminus, a cluster of conserved serine residues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) located adjacent to the active site, but away from the dimer interface of the protease initiates long\u2010range cooperative interactions to modulate dimerization 22. The mutation of Ser147 to Ala, which does not make any contact with the opposite subunit, totally abolished dimerization and enzyme activity. However, the measured K\nD values of the dimer varied 14, 20, 23, 24, but a His\u2010tag of the recombinant protein for NiNTA purification might interfere with the dimer formation 12.",

            "text": "From the crystal structure, the N\u2010terminal residues 1\u20137 (N\u2010finger) are buried in the dimer interface with numerous contacts with the domain II close to the active site of the other protomer (Fig. 3) 10, 18, 25, 26. The first crystal structure of SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro is complexed with a substrate\u2010like hexapeptidyl chloromethylketone (Cbz\u2010Val\u2010Asn\u2010Ser\u2010Thr\u2010Leu\u2010Gln\u2010CMK) inhibitor, revealing the structural features of this protease 10. The protease forms a dimer with two protomers oriented almost at right angles to each other. The Cys\u2010His catalytic dyad is located in an active site cleft between domains I and II, which adopt antiparallel \u03b2\u2010barrel structures. Domain III, for mediating the tight dimerization, contains five \u03b1\u2010helices arranged into a large antiparallel globular cluster. Another structure of the protease with C\u2010terminal six amino acids from the neighboring protomer bound in the active site (product\u2010bound form) reveals the detailed interactions of the protease with the P1 to P6 amino acids (QFTVGS) 18. In this structure, two protomers (A and B) form a dimer, and the N terminus of protomer A is located close to the active site of protomer B. However, in the active site of protomer B, extra electron density originating from the six C\u2010terminal amino acids of protomer B\u2032 (the nearby protomer in the crystal packing) was found. The side chain of Gln (the last C\u2010terminal residue of protomer B\u2032) is \u223c10 \u00c5 away from the side chain of Ser (the first N\u2010terminal residue of protomer A), suggesting a positional shift after autocatalytic cleavage of the premature protease. This structure provides the necessary information for rational design of the active\u2010site inhibitors 18. The detailed interactions in the active site are as follows. In the S1 site, the side chain O\u03f51 and N\u03f52 of Gln306 (P1) form hydrogen bonds with N\u03f52 of the His163 imidazole ring and the carboxylate of Glu166. The oxygen atom of the side chain of P1\u2010Gln forms H\u2010bonds with the backbone NH atoms of Gly143 and Cys145. Therefore, the S\u03b3 atom of Cys145 is at a suitable position to attack the peptide bond. The S2 site is formed by the main\u2010chain atoms of Val186, Asp187, Arg188, and Gln189 as well as the side chain atoms of His41, Met49, and Met165 to hold a bulky side chain, such as Val, Leu, or Phe at the P2 position. The N atom in the main chain of P2\u2010Phe interacts with the O atom of His164 and the side chain interacts with Met49, Met165, Asp187, and Arg188 through hydrophobic interactions. The side chain of P3\u2010Thr is oriented toward the bulk solvent, so a hydrophilic residue can also exist at this position. The main\u2010chain O atom of P4\u2010Val accepts a H\u2010bond (3.1 \u00c5) from the N\u03f52 atom of Gln189, and the N atom of the Val donates a H\u2010bond to the O\u03f51 atom of Gln189, while another main\u2010chain NH donates a H\u2010bond (3.3 \u00c5) to Gln189. The side chain of P4\u2010Val interacts with Met165 and Gln189 via hydrophobic interactions. S5 subsite is composed of the main\u2010chain atoms of Thr190, Ala191, and Gln192. P5\u2010Gly is not in contact with the protease. The S6 site is almost positioned at the outer area of the protein. However, the O atom and O\u03b3 of P6\u2010Ser still interact with the backbone N and O atoms of Gln192.",

            "text": "Several inhibitors against SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro identified by different laboratories using high\u2010throughput screening have been described previously 27. Wu et al. identified \u223c50 active compounds by cell\u2010based assay that block SARS\u2010CoV replication, including two existing drugs, reserpine and aescin 28. In the subsequent target verification, a compound named TL\u20103 that was developed as a transition\u2010state analogue of the HIV protease (inhibition constant K\ni = 1.5 nM and 4 nM, against HIV protease and feline immunodeficiency virus protease, respectively) 29 was able to inhibit the SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro (K\ni = 0.6 \u03bcM; measured by the Edans\u2010Dabcyl FRET assay) (1, Fig. 4). Lopinavir (one of the two components from the anti\u2010AIDS drug Kaletra\u00ae from Abbott) was shown to weakly inhibit the protease (K\ni = 15 \u03bcM), consistent with observed better clinical outcome for treating SARS patients with this drug in a Hong Kong Hospital 30. Blanchard et al. had screened 50 000 drug\u2010like small molecules to find five novel SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, MAC\u20105576, MAC\u20108120, MAC\u201013985, MAC\u201022272, and MAC\u201030731 (2\u20136, Fig. 4), with IC50 values of 0.5\u20137 \u03bcM measured using Abz\u2010Tyr(NO2) FRET assay 15. Kao et al. screened 50 240 structurally diverse small molecules and found 2 compounds targeting the SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro\n31. One of the compounds, MP576 (7, Fig. 4), a 3\u2010quinolinecarboxylic acid, displayed inhibitory activity with a K\ni value of 2.5 \u03bcM in the HPLC\u2010based cleavage assay and an EC50 value (half maximal effective concentration) of 7 \u03bcM in the Vero cell\u2010based SARS\u2010CoV plaque reduction assay without apparent toxicity (CC50 (half maximal cytostatic concentration)  > 50 \u03bcM) 32. The other compound, MP521 (8, Fig. 4), an imidazolidine, exhibited a K\ni value of 11 \u03bcM, an EC50 value of 14 \u03bcM, and a CC50 value > 50 \u03bcM. A library of 960 commercially available drugs and biologically active substances were screened by Hsu et al. using the cell\u2010based assay to find three inhibitors, namely phenylmercuric acetate, thimerosal, and hexachlorophene (9\u201311, Fig. 4), which inhibited SARS protease activity according to the Edans\u2010Dabcyl FRET assay 33. The K\ni values of phenylmercuric acetate, thimerosal, and hexachlorophene were determined to be 0.7, 2.4, and 13.7 \u03bcM, respectively. Phenylmercuric acetate and thimerosal containing mercury are used as pharmaceutical excipients and more widely used as antimicrobial preservatives in parenteral and topical pharmaceutical formulations 34. As shown below, other metal\u2010containing compounds (such as zinc\u2010containing compounds) were also identified to be the protease inhibitors. The hexachlorophene derivatives were further explored as SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitors with similar inhibitory activity using the Abz\u2010Dnp FRET assay by Liu et al. 35. Chen et al. screened from a natural product library consisting of 720 compounds to obtain two compounds, tannic acid (IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) = 3 \u03bcM) and 3\u2010isotheaflavin\u20103\u2010gallate (TF2B) (IC50 = 7 \u03bcM), to be inhibitors of SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro with the Edans\u2010Dabcyl assay 36. These two large compounds (structures not shown) belong to a group of natural polyphenols in tea 37. Also from a natural product library, an esculetin\u20104\u2010carboxylic acid ethyl ester (MC8; 12, Fig. 4) with an IC50 value of 46 \u03bcM against SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro was derived from the marine sponge Axinella corrugate 38. The screening was performed by using a sensitive red\u2010shifted internally quenched fluorogenic substrate for SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro, also based on the FRET between the CAL Fluor Red 610 and Black Hole Quencher\u20101 as a donor\u2010acceptor pair. In the cell\u2010based assays, MC8 is an effective inhibitor of SARS\u2010CoV replication in Vero cells at non\u2010cytotoxic concentrations (EC50 = 112 \u03bcM; CC50 > 800 \u03bcM).",

            "text": "Dragovich et al. synthesized a series of compounds targeting rhinovirus 3C protease for the possible treatment of the human common cold 39. The best inhibitor is AG7088, a ketomethyl isostere of a tripeptide\u2010conjugated ester (a peptide\u2010like rhinovirus 3C protease inhibitor) with an EC50 value of 0.013 \u03bcM in inhibiting the rhinovirus protease 40, 41. Its P1 is a \u03b3\u2010lactam moiety to mimic the P1 glutamine residue, and P1\u2032 is an \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated ester that acts as a Michael acceptor to inhibit the rhinovirus 3Cpro by forming a covalent bond with the active site Cys residue. To improve cell membrane permeability, the P2 phenylalanine residue was replaced with a methylene isostere bearing a 4\u2010fluorophenyl substituent. Although it was a potent inhibitor of the rhinovirus 3Cpro, it was not approved for clinical use due to a lack of obvious advantage in treating patients with common cold. He et al. from Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., applied for a US patent entitled \u201cInhibitors of SARS 3C like protease\u201d for the application of the AG7088\u2010like compounds with Michael acceptor to inhibit the SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. Two formulae were proposed as potential SARS protease inhibitors (13 and 14, Fig. 5) without giving their activity data 42. Kania et al. from Pfizer, Inc., developed a series of compounds with the same structural features of \u03b3\u2010lactam at P1 and a isobutyl group at P2 to inhibit SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro, as described in their world patent entitled \u201cAnticoronaviral compounds and compositions, their pharmaceutical uses and materials for their synthesis\u201d 43. These compounds were shown to provide protection for the Vero cells from HCoV 229E and SARS\u2010CoV infection in a viability assay. Although having the same structural features, some of these compounds were inactive (EC50 > 100 \u03bcM) against the SARS\u2010CoV and some showed inhibitory activity. The best compound of this series displayed an EC50 value of 0.8 \u03bcM (15, Fig. 5) to inhibit SARS\u2010CoV replication by targeting the SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro without toxicity (CC50 > 320 \u03bcM). A general formula is given in Fig. 5 (16). Rao et al. applied for a patent covering a series of AG7088 analogues with the common structure of compound 17 (Fig. 5) as inhibitors of SARS 3CLpro\n44. Using a continuous fluorometric assay with the fluorogenic substrate MCA\u2010AVLQSGFR\u2010Lys(Dnp)Lys\u2010NH2, an effective compound (18, Fig. 5) in this series inhibited not only the 3CLpro of SARS\u2010CoV (K\ni = 9 \u03bcM, k\ninact (rate of enzyme inactivation) = 0.0031 s\u22121), but also the protease of HCoV 229E, TGEV, feline infectious peritonitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and infectious bronchitis virus 45. This compound exhibited an EC50 value of 4.3 \u03bcM against mouse hepatitis virus on murine delay brain tumour cells in a plaque\u2010reduction assay. It also has low toxicity (500 \u03bcM compound only displayed 28 % inhibition of cell growth). Yang et al. discovered a potent inhibitor from the AG7088 analogues with cyclic \u03b3\u2010lactam at the P1 position, TG\u20100205221 (K\ni = 0.053 \u03bcM for compound 19, Fig. 5), based on the HPLC assay 45. The inhibitor exhibited potent activities in suppressing replication of SARS\u2010CoV (4.7 log viral titer reduction at 5 \u03bcM concentration, EC50 = 0.6 \u03bcM and cytotoxicity CC50 > 20 \u03bcM) and HCoV 229E (5.2 log viral titer reduction at 1.25 \u03bcM concentration, EC50 = 0.14 \u03bcM). The tight binding between TG\u20100205221 and the SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro is through a covalent bond, hydrogen bonds, and unprecedented hydrophobic interactions as evidenced by the crystal structure of the corresponding complex 46. Shie et al. found that the replacement of the \u03b3\u2010lactam moiety in AG7088 with a phenylalanine side chain resulted in a more potent SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitor 47. As shown in Fig. 5, the best inhibitor (20) of this series has a K\ni value of 0.5 \u03bcM measured by the Edans\u2010Dabcyl FRET assay. The compound also showed potent activity (EC50 = 0.2 \u03bcM) against SARS\u2010CoV replication by blocking the synthesis of the viral spike protein without apparent toxicity (CC50 > 200 \u03bcM) in cell\u2010based assays 47. From the computer modelling, the phenylalanine side chain at P1 and P2 positions may be shifted by one position to occupy S2 and S3 sites as the \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated Michael acceptor is not covalently bound with the Cys145. According to the product\u2010bound crystal structure of the SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro\n18, S2 is a hydrophobic pocket to hold the hydrophobic residue, and the P3 side chain is exposed to the solvent.",

In fact, this Ser cluster is conserved in all known CoV proteases and may represent a common target of wide\u2010spectrum CoV protease inhibitors. Based on the known reactivity of boronic acid compounds with the hydroxyl group in Ser residues, the inhibitory potency of bifunctional boronic acid compounds was evaluated. A chemical scaffold containing two phenyl boronic groups attached to a central aromatic ring by ester linkages were tested. This compound has a K\ni value of 0.04 \u03bcM based on an Edans\u2010Dabcyl FRET assay. Different variations of the compound were prepared, including several isomers with replacement of the central aromatic ring with shorter ester linkage and different functionalities at the phenyl boronic rings. The highest improvement in affinity was observed when the ester linkage between the aromatic rings was replaced with an amide group, thereby resulting in nanomolar inhibition constants. The inhibitors display a mixed competitive pattern and bind to both free enzyme and enzyme substrate complex. This may be due to the large substrate used in the kinetic measurements. These compounds inhibited the enzyme in a reversible manner. Freire et al. provided a series of organic boron\u2010containing compounds (compound 31 as a representative and 31A, 31B, and 31C as examples in Fig. 6), compositions thereof and methods of using such compounds and compositions for inhibiting CoV proteases and for treating infections 66. The invention provides a method of inhibiting CoV proteases, treating infections caused by CoV and detecting CoV, particularly CoV proteases that have one or more serine or threonine residue(s) at or near its active site and proteases of SARS\u2010associated CoV. Such methods comprise contacting the testing sample obtained from a patient with boron\u2010containing compound 31\n66 that have been: i) tethered to an appropriate surface such that protease coming into contact and being bound to the tethered compound can be detected; ii) labelled by fluorescent, radioactive, or other markers that allow identification of CoV protease bound to the compound; or iii) that by any other means can be used to detect the presence of CoV protease.",

As analogous to picornaviruses 3C proteases, 3CLpro has substrate specificity in cleaving the amide bond between P1\u2010Gln and a small amino acid such as Ser, Ala, or Gly at P1\u2032 78, 79. According to the structure of SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro\n10, 18, this small P1\u2032 residue is near Thr25, which likely limits the substrate specificity. Since the recombinant SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro can undergo auto\u2010processing 18, 80, a modification on the S1\u2032 might tolerate a large amino acid at P1\u2032 position. In fact, SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro with T25G mutation expands the S1\u2032 site and, thus, is able to cleave peptides with larger amino acids such as Met (the starting amino acid of most native proteins) at P1\u2032 81 (Fig. 8a). Indeed, compared with the k\ncat of 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 min\u22121 and the K\nm of 76.6 \u00b1 3.5 \u03bcM for the wild\u2010type, the T25G mutant displays the k\ncat of 16.2 \u00b1 0.5 min\u22121 and the K\nm of 18.6 \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcM (43.5\u2010fold higher k\ncat/K\nm) against the SAVLQ\u2193MGFRK substrate. Moreover, vectors that contain the nucleotides encoding the T25G recognition site AVLQ\u2193M between the tags and the N\u2010terminal Met of the target proteins have been constructed and expressed by the prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. In these vectors, PstI (CTGCAG) is chosen as a 5\u2032 cloning site, since its sequence overlaps with the nucleotide sequence (GCGGTGCTGCAG) encoding the protease recognition site (Fig. 8B). Identical 5\u2032\u2010PstI/3\u2032\u2010XhoI cloning sites in these vectors can be used to allow sticky\u2010end DNA fragments of the target genes generated by PCR 82 to ligate with these vectors simultaneously (parallel cloning method) 83, 84. These engineered vectors and the T25G mutant can be assembled as a kit for the maximal production of soluble and functional proteins with authentic sequences (see the patent entitled \u201cProtein expression system involving mutated severe respiratory syndrome\u2010associated coronavirus 3C\u2010like protease\u201c by Liang et al. 85).",

In this review article, the effective inhibitors against SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro are summarized and the methodology for detecting the protease activity and inhibitor screening are discussed. Most of the peptidomimetic inhibitors of the SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro are designed based on its substrate specificity of P1\u2010Gln, but some have Phe to replace the Gln moiety. For covalent inhibitors, the electrophilic structural features, such as Michael acceptor (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated ester), fluoromethyl ketone, aziridine, epoxide, and etacrynic acid, are built in to react with the active\u2010site Cys residue. The metal\u2010containing compounds also target the Cys145 residue. Other compounds that have been suggested to bind to the active site of SARS protease based on computer modelling are potential inhibitors. All the inhibitors for SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro may also be used in inhibiting other viral proteases due to some degree of structural similarity of their active sites. In fact, some of the SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitors are derived from previously identified rhinovirus 3Cpro inhibitors such as AG7088 (now called Rupintrivir). Rupintrivir is a potent inhibitor of 3Cpro based on in vitro and in vivo studies. Its analogues modified based on the structural differences between 3Cpro and 3CLpro represent promising leads for anti\u2010CoV agents.",

Structural studies have revealed that 3Cpro is a monomer, whereas 3CLpro is a dimeric protein which has an extra third domain for dimer formation, although their active sites are superimposed very well 87. Moreover, 3Cpro has a more open but shallow S2 site, as well as a smaller S3 site, which account for different inhibitory specificity, as concluded from the structural comparison of the same inhibitor in the 3Cpro and 3CLpro active sites 86. Moreover, these inhibitors could possibly serve as new drug leads for other viral diseases such as those caused by rhinovirus, HCoV 229E, enterovirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and infectious bronchitis virus. Particularly, the recently emerged SARS\u2010like coronavirus, human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV\u2010EMC), also called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), has a 3CLpro structurally similar to SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro and the protease can be inhibited by N3 (18, Fig. 5) 88, which is a Rupintrivir analogue inhibiting SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. Moreover, CE\u20105, a small\u2010molecule inhibitor of 3CLpro of SARS\u2010CoV 89 also inhibits the activity of MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro\n90.
