            "text": "We report here the results of a 7-month survey of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in the Virology laboratory of the public hospitals of Marseille (April-November 2009). In total, 8 587 samples were analysed during this period, of which 1 974 (23%) were positive for the novel influenza variant. The analysis of results obtained using rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) revealed a global sensitivity of 49.4% (vs. molecular qRT-PCR detection), strongly correlated with age groups (varying from 30% to 58% for patients >40 age and <10, respectively), indicating that RIDTs can be helpful in accelerating the management of suspected cases. Epidemiological analysis showed that the winter influenza wave began in October in Marseille (i.e. 2 to 3 months earlier than usual seasonal influenza outbreaks) and that the majority of autochthonous cases were observed in patients younger than 20 years old, with a low number of cases in patients over 60 years old. In November 2009, 22.2% (167/754) of patients with a laboratory diagnosis of influenza A/H1N1 infection were hospitalized, of which 9% (15/167) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Patients in the extreme age groups (>40 years old and <1) were significantly more often hospitalized than others, and 2.4% of hospitalized patients died. During the last 3 weeks of the period, the average number of bed-days attributable to H1N1sw-positive patients was 31.4, of which 5.9 were in ICUs.",

In September, the number of samples increased suddenly but the percentage of H1N1sw-positive samples decreased ( Fig. 1 ).

During this period, patients in the 10-19 years age group represented 30% of H1N1swpositive patients (Fig. 2a ,b) but this proportion increased in September (weeks 36-38), to reach more than 40% of infected patients. From mid-September, the proportion of patients younger than 10 years who were tested or infected by H1N1sw increased, representing approximately 40% of both groups and the distribution among age groups remained globally stable afterwards (Fig. 2a,b) . The N\u00a2/N ratio (allowing standardization of the number of samples in the age groups) showed that the highest proportion of positive patients was observed in the 10-19 years age group (30-60%) and that this proportion fluctuated c. 20% for patients over 40 years old (Fig. 2c) . During the complete study period the majority of patients infected by H1N1sw were younger than 20 years old.",

The very first imported cases were observed from April to August in travellers returning from abroad (mainly Mexico and the USA), and thus with a majority of adults [9] . In the second phase, with indigenous cases, which became predominant during the summer, the number of paediatric cases (<10 years old) increased progressively to reach a stable proportion of approximately 40% of all cases. Consequently, the global distribution among age groups became comparable to that previously observed for seasonal H1N1 outbreaks [11] , with a majority of cases in patients younger than 20 years, confirming data from other countries [7, 12] ) and a low number of patients over 60 years old. The final phase, a 'winter' wave, began in Marseille during October (as was also observed in other regions of metropolitan France [13]) 2-3 months before the classic winter wave of seasonal influenza.",

Our results suggest that RIDTs could make a significant contribution to the management of suspected cases. They allowed more rapid delivery of positive diagnosis (<2 h) for 49.4% of the H1N1sw-positive samples, the highest sensitivity (close to 60%) being obtained in children younger than 10 years. Other studies showed a similar sensitivity for the detection of this new variant [13] and an equal analytical sensitivity between seasonal influenza and this new variant [14] using the BD EZ Flu A+B test.",
