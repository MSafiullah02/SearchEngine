            "text": "Community\u2010acquired viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) are common causes of acute respiratory illness in the general community and have been increasingly recognized as common pathogens after solid organ transplantation (1, 2, 3). In this patient population, infection with these pathogens can occasionally result in severe pulmonary disease with significant morbidity and mortality. The most common community respiratory viruses include influenza A and B, parainfluenza serotypes 1, 2 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses and the recently described human metapneumovirus (4, 5). While lung transplantation has emerged as an effective life\u2010saving treatment option for a number of diseases resulting in end\u2010stage lung disease, these patients are at particular risk for viral RTIs due to a number of factors. These include potent immunosuppression regimens, decreased cough reflex due to denervation of the transplanted lung, abnormal lymphatic drainage, impaired mucociliary clearance and direct exposure of the allograft to the environment (6, 7). It has been suggested that lung transplant recipients infected with community\u2010acquired viral RTIs have a high rate of progression to severe viral pneumonitis (8).",

Specifically, they may trigger immunologically mediated lung injury resulting in the development of acute and chronic rejection (3, 9). Chronic rejection occurs in up to 80% of patients 5\u201310 years after lung transplantation and is the major factor limiting long\u2010term success of this intervention (6). Chronic rejection is defined as obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) by histopathology or can be diagnosed clinically based on sustained declines in lung function (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)) (10). The proposed mechanisms of such injury likely relate to the upregulation of inflammatory cytokine production initiated by viral replication or a direct cytopathic effect on the respiratory epithelium (9).",

Acute rejection was diagnosed on the basis of a transbronchial biopsy that demonstrated characteristic perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates using criteria defined by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) (14). Patients with acute rejection were included in the analysis if their biopsy showed Grade 2 or higher rejection. In patients in whom a biopsy could not be performed, a clinical diagnosis of rejection was permitted (i.e. a deterioration in lung function with no other identifiable etiology that responded to a high\u2010dose corticosteroid therapy).2\nFEV\u20101 decline > 20%. An FEV\u20101 decline of >20% at 3 months was chosen as being significant in determining chronic allograft dysfunction. An irreversible decline of 20% from post\u2010transplant maximum has been used for the definition of BOS and has been considered significant (10). Patients with a decline of FEV\u20101 of 20% by 3 months post\u2010enrolment were evaluated out to 1 year to see if they met the clinical definition of BOS or the histopathologic definition of OB.A clinical diagnosis for BOS was made using the ISHLT algorithm based on FEV\u20101 values. In this algorithm, BOS is defined as a sustained reduction in FEV\u20101 to \u226480% of maximum baseline value in the absence of another etiology. BOS can be further staged with stages 1\u20133 indicating a progressively worsening condition, with 66 to 80%, 51 to 65% and \u226450% of maximum baseline values, respectively (10). The diagnosis of OB was made on pathological grounds by the presence of fibrous scarring in the walls of the small conducting airways, with partial or complete obliteration of the lumen (10).3\nBacterial or fungal superinfection. A bacterial or fungal superinfection was diagnosed when a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture demonstrated a bacterial or fungal pathogen and a new infiltrate developed on chest radiograph within the follow\u2010up period.\n",

Such data, by nature, tend to result in case ascertainment bias and thus include more severe cases of viral RTIs, specifically those associated with pneumonia. For example, Khalifah et al. retrospectively reviewed 259 lung transplant recipients and found 21 respiratory viral infections (16). These 21 patients were at increased risk for BOS and death. The majority of these patients (11 of 21) had lower tract respiratory infections. Similarly, 10 episodes of viral RTIs were found in a review of 122 lung transplant recipients (17). Four of these patients developed OB and two died of lower tract infection. Similar data from other groups have also suggested a high rate of severe lower tract infection, a detrimental effect on lung function and a triggering of BOS (18, 19, 20, 21). Since viral infections were detected in the clinical setting, extensive microbiological investigation, including the use of RT\u2010PCR to detect viruses such as coronaviruses, rhinoviruses and metapneumovirus were not routinely used in the majority of previous studies.",

In addition to the commonly recognized pathogens in lung transplant patients, such as influenza, RSV and parainfluenza, we found a number of infections due to rhinovirus, coronavirus (other than SARS) and one infection due to metapneumovirus. None of these viruses has been well described in the lung transplant literature, although they are well\u2010recognized causes of community\u2010acquired RTIs in immunocompetent persons. Recently, severe lower tract infections with rhinovirus, non\u2010SARS coronavirus and metapneumovirus have been suggested in studies evaluating immunocompromised patients (including lung transplant recipients) with the use of RT\u2010PCR on BAL samples that had been obtained during acute respiratory events (5, 19). In our study, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses together accounted for 52% of microbiologically confirmed viral infections, but all of these infections were relatively mild and self\u2010limited. In a subset of patients, however, they were associated with serious indirect sequelae. For example, in the eight patients with rejection, four had prior rhinovirus infection and one had prior coronavirus infection (one had prior influenza and one had prior RSV). One noteworthy observation in this study is that one patient was infected with the recently described human coronavirus NL63 (15, 22). To our knowledge, this is the first published report of HCoV\u2010NL63 infection in an organ transplant recipient.",

Alternatively, these patients may have had atypical bacterial etiologies for their symptoms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae or other known or unknown viruses not included in the testing panel. The time lag between the onset of symptoms and specimen collection may have also reduced the yield of viruses. Interestingly, four patients in the asymptomatic group without viral RTI symptoms were also positive for rhinovirus by RT\u2010PCR.

To attempt to control for some of these variables, only patients who had been clinically well, rejection free and with a stable FEV\u20101 in the 3 months prior to enrolment were included in the study. The incidence of acute rejection in the 6 months prior to enrolment was low, and comparable in both arms. We excluded those with a positive CMV antigenemia at the time of enrolment.

Aerosolized ribavirin has been reported as beneficial in uncontrolled studies of parainfluenza and RSV infections (20, 26). Other therapies that may be beneficial include intravenous immunoglobulin, RSV immunoglobulin and palivizumab (27). Ribavirin has also been used by some for parainfluenza virus infections although good evidence of its efficacy is lacking (27). Pleconaril has activity against rhinovirus infections, but remains an investigational drug, and no specific antiviral agent exists for coronaviruses (28).
