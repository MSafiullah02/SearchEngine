The emerging situation raises many urgent\nquestions. Could the widely disseminated viruses transmit to other animal species, which then\nbecome reservoirs of infection? The SARS-CoV-2 infection has a wide clinical spectrum in\nhumans, from mild infection to death, but how does the virus behave in other animals? As\nefforts are made for vaccine and antiviral drug development, which animal(s) can be used most\nprecisely to model the efficacy of such control measures in humans? To address these\nquestions, we evaluated the susceptibility of different model laboratory animals, as well as\ncompanion and domestic animals to SARS-CoV-2.",

Two animals were scheduled to be\neuthanized on days 3 p.i. and 6 p.i., respectively, to evaluate viral replication in their\norgans. Three subadult cats were placed in separate cages within an isolator. To monitor\nrespiratory droplet transmission, an uninfected cat was placed in a cage adjacent to each of\nthe infected cats. It was difficult to perform regular nasal wash collection on the subadult\ncats because they were aggressive. To avoid possible injury, we only collected feces from\nthese cats and checked for viral RNA in their organs after euthanasia.",

(pair\none, red bars) or on day 12 p.i. (pair 2 and pair 3). Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 of\nthese euthanized subadult cats were detected by using an ELISA (C) and neutralization\nassay (D). (E) Viral RNA in nasal washes of juvenile cats. Sera of the juvenile cats were\ncollected on day 20 p.i., except for one virus inoculated animal died on day 13 p.i. and\nthe antibody values of this cat (indicated by asterisks) were detected from the sera\ncollected on day 10 p.i., their antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by using an\nELISA (F) and neutralization assay (G). Each color bar represents the value from an\nindividual animal. The horizontal dashed lines in the panels C and F show the cutoff value\nfor seroconversion, and the horizontal dashed lines in other panels indicate the lower\nlimit of detection.",
