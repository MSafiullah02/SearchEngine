Because previous research has shown that patients who receive high doses of steroids can develop manic symptoms or manic syndrome [2, 3], it has been theorized that SARS-related psychosis was caused by steroid treatment. However, other etiologies should also be considered. SARS-associated coronavirus, the pathogen involved in SARS, has been detected in CSF samples obtained from patients with SARS [4]. In addition, patients with SARS are subject to many physical and psychological stresses. Hypoxia, concomitant sepsis, sleep deprivation, social isolation (as a result of being quarantined), fear of death, and concurrent SARS infections within the family are all profound stressors that can precipitate psychosis. Last, the fact that only a small number of these highly stressed patients with SARS developed acute psychosis suggests that personal vulnerability may be relevant.",
