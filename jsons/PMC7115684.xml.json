The hMPV gene constellation, genome organization and nucleotide sequences were most closely related to avian pneumovirus subtype C (APV/C) [3], the causative agent of severe and life-threatening upper respiratory tract infection in turkeys. hMPV is the newest addition to the Pneumovirinae subfamily that also includes other mammalian respiratory pathogens such as human and bovine RSV and pneumovirus of mice (PVM) [4].",

It has since also been identified in North [5], [6], [7] and South America [8] as well as Asia [9], [10], [11], Africa [12] and Australia [13] from patients as young as <1 year [5], [6] and as old as 87 years of age [14]. hMPV infection occurs in the winter and peak incidence in the northern hemisphere are from December to February [6], [15]. The clinical syndrome associated with hMPV infection is similar to that observed for RSV infection ranging from mild respiratory illness to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [1], [5], [7]. The impact of hMPV infections appears to be greatest for infants, the elderly and the immunocompromised [5], [6], [7], [16], [17] similar to populations at-risk for severe RSV infections. Seven to twelve percent of respiratory tract illnesses in young children can be attributed to hMPV infection [5], [16] although the hMPV-associated disease rate was lower (4.5%) in young and elderly adults [17]. The full extent of disease burden and health care costs associated with hMPV infections are still undetermined. A live attenuated hMPV vaccine would be an appropriate addition to the vaccines currently under development against other pediatric respiratory tract diseases caused by hRSV and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3) [18], [19].",

Therefore, vaccination strategies against hMPV infections must be effective against both groups of hMPV. Comparison of hMPV sequences from Europe, Asia and South America showed no geographic clustering or antigenic drift between the A and B viruses [21]. hMPV-infected ferret and hamster sera neutralized homologous group viruses better than viruses belonging to the heterologous group [21], [22]. This effect was also observed for African green monkey (AGM) sera [22], [23]. However, hamsters and AGMs infected with hMPV from one group were effectively protected when challenged with heterologous group hMPV [22], [23].",

Of the three hMPV surface glycoproteins, the predicted amino acid sequence of the F protein (95% identity) was the most highly conserved between the genetic lineages of hMPV while the SH (59% identity) and the G (37% identity) glycoproteins were poorly conserved [2], [24]. The hMPV F protein is thus likely to be the major antigen that induces cross-protection in hamsters and AGMs [23]. We have previously shown that a chimeric PIV3 virus [25], [26] expressing the hMPV/NL/1/00 F protein (b/h PIV3/hMPV F2), elicited hMPV serum neutralizing antibodies and protected hamsters from homologous hMPV challenge [27].

AGMs are highly permissive for both hMPV [22], [23] and PIV3 [28] infections and provide a good model for assessing the immunogenicity and efficacy of the b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 vaccine candidate. For this reason, the host-range restricted replication of bPIV3, and its derivatives relative to hPIV3, cannot be evaluated in AGMs. However, the restricted replication of bPIV3 compared to hPIV3 was previously demonstrated in the respiratory tract of chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys and this attenuation phenotype was shown to correlate with the safety profile of bPIV3 in human infants [29], [30], [31], [32]. We have previously shown that rbPIV3, the virus vector was restricted in replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys compared to hPIV3, and that replacement of the bovine PIV3 F and HN gene with human PIV3 F and HN resulted in an intermediate level of attenuation [33]. Here, we compared the replication of the chimeric b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 virus with wt hPIV3, recombinant bPIV3 (rbPIV3) and a bovine parainfluenza virus expressing the human PIV3 F and HN genes (b/h PIV3) in the respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys. The results of our studies in African green and rhesus monkeys indicated that b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 elicited hMPV- and hPIV3-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and was efficacious and attenuated. Thus, further evaluation of this vaccine candidate in humans is warranted to assess its potential as a pediatric vaccine for prevention of respiratory tract diseases caused by hMPV.",

The tracheal dose volume was 1 ml containing 5.3 log10 pfu of b/h PIV3/hMPV F2, 5.4 log10 pfu of hPIV3/JS, 5.0 log10 pfu of rbPIV3 or 5.0 log10 pfu b/h PIV3 in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) stablilized with 1\u00d7 SPG. Monkeys were lightly sedated prior to dosing. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected daily for 13 days post-immunization while bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens were collected on alternate days post-immunization under light sedation as described for the AGM study. Samples were stabilized with 1\u00d7 SPG, frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C. Blood was collected by venipuncture of the peripheral veins on days 1 (prior to dosing), 7, 14 and 21 and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C for serological analysis. The rhesus monkeys were also monitored for clinical signs of a cold. Virus titrations of the NP and BAL specimens were performed on Vero cells. Plaques were visualized by immunostaining with PIV3 or hMPV-specific polyclonal antibodies and enumerated.",

In tissue culture-based assays, ribavirin and IVIG preparations containing high titers of hMPV-neutralizing antibody (10 log2/0.05 ml) were found to inhibit hMPV replication [35]. The utility of these reagents for treatment against hMPV infection in humans remains to be tested. The strategy presented here utilized an attenuated PIV3 virus vector to deliver the hMPV F protein with the aim of inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immunity against hMPV infection.

            "text": "Two main genetic lineages of hMPV have been identified and immunization strategies must address questions about cross-protection between the two major groups of hMPV. Results from animal studies suggest that infection with one group of hMPV can provide cross-protection against infections by other hMPV subgroups [21], [22], [23]. The hMPV F protein that is highly conserved among the different lineages of hMPV, is sufficient to provide protection in animals against hMPV infection in the absence of the other hMPV surface glycoproteins, such as G and SH [23], [27]. Furthermore, exposure to the hMPV F protein from group A hMPV protected animals from infection with group B hMPV [23]. In the present study, we did not challenge b/h PIV3/hMPV F2- immunized animals with subgroup B hMPV. However, sera from b/h PIV3/hMPV F2- and hMPV/NL/1/00-infected AGMs showed a rise in neutralization titer against hMPV/NL/1/99, about 40% of that seen with hMPV/NL/1/00. This level of cross-neutralization against hMPV/NL/1/99 was also seen in previous animal studies with wt hMPV/NL/1/00-infected hamsters and AGMs [22], [23]. Despite lower titers of cross-neutralization antibodies against heterologous group hMPV, effective protection against heterologous group hMPV challenge were observed in hamsters and AGMs [22], [23]. In this study, b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 was shown to elicit hMPV-specific as well as virus-specific antibodies and T cell responses in AGMs that received the vaccine virus. The hMPV-specific T cell response was lower in AGMs immunized with b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 compared to hMPV/NL/1/00-infected animals likely because only one hMPV antigen was expressed by the chimeric virus. Cellular immune responses have been demonstrated in human RSV infection [38] and are thought to contribute to clearing of RSV infection in mice [39], [40]. It is likely that cell-mediated immunity also contributes to the effective protection and cross-protection against the different hMPV strains. Although sera from AGMs infected with b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 expressing a group A hMPV F glycoprotein showed lower neutralization titers against a group B hMPV/NL/1/99, the presence of both humoral and cellular immune responses suggest that the vaccinated AGMs may also be protected against group B hMPV infections.",

            "text": "A question of considerable interest in using virus vectors for delivery of antigens is whether the host will develop immunity to the vector itself. This is important not only for using the same vector to deliver different antigens for sequential vaccinations but also to fulfill the need for boosting in the event that the primary vaccination is insufficient to induce lasting protective immunity. The second point is particularly relevant when the target population is young infants because they have undeveloped immune systems and may need multiple doses to stimulate a robust protective response. It is not clear how long the immune response to hMPV and/or hPIV3 will persist in AGMs. It has been reported that PIV3 humoral immunity can last up to 4 months in hamsters [41]. We were unable to detect any decay in PIV3 HAI antibody titer or hMPV neutralizing antibody titers in hamsters 6 months after immunization with 102 pfu or 103 pfu of b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 (data not shown). The apparent long-term immunity seen in hamsters may not reflect the immune status of PIV3 infections in young infants. A recent hPIV3 clinical trial in young infants showed that multiple doses of an attenuated hPIV3 did not result in inhibitory vector immunity provided the intervals between dose administrations were timed appropriately [42]. Only 24% of infants shed virus when a second dose of vaccine was administered 1 month later. In contrast, 62% of infants shed virus after the second dose when the interval between the primary and secondary dose was 3 months. Thus, a boosting regimen that maximizes both vaccine take and duration of immunity in young infants should be >1 month but <3 months. Maternally-derived HAI serum antibody titers as high as 5.7 log2 in 4\u201312 week-old infants did not appear to interfere with the replication of an attenuated hPIV3 (cp-45) vaccine strain [42]. Since we have now shown sufficient efficacy, immunogenicity and attenuation of b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 in primate models, it might be interesting to test the effect of boosting on the ability of b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 to more effectively protect the URT of AGMs against hMPV challenge.",

While the bPIV3 F and HN genes contain some genetic determinants specifying attenuation [30], [33], the major contributors to the attenuation phenotype were ascribed to the bPIV3 N and P proteins. The polygenic distribution of the bPIV3 attenuation markers predicts that the attenuation phenotype will be stable. Indeed it was shown that bPIV3 isolated from seronegative children was phenotypically stable and retained the host-range restricted replication in rhesus monkeys [31]. The stability of the inserted hMPV F has not been tested in vivo. However, b/h PIV3/RSV F2 an identical PIV3 vector expressing the RSV F gene at the second genome position, was found to retain RSV F expression after four serial passages in the respiratory tract of hamsters. Nonetheless, stable retention of the added hMPV F gene needs to be further evaluated in humans.",
