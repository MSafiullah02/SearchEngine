            "text": "COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a major source of morbidity and mortality due to its inflammatory effects in the lungs and heart. The p38 MAPK pathway plays a crucial role in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and has been implicated in acute lung injury and myocardial dysfunction. The overwhelming inflammatory response in COVID-19 infection may be due to caused by disproportionately upregulated p38 activity, explained by two mechanisms. First, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity is lost during SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs and heart and converts Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1-7. Angiotensin II signals proinflammatory, pro-vasoconstrictive, pro-thrombotic activity through p38 MAPK activation, which is countered by Angiotensin 1-7 downregulation of p38 activity. Loss of ACE2 during upon viral entry may tip the balance towards destructive p38 signaling through Angiotensin II. Second, SARS-CoV was previously shown to directly upregulate p38 activity via a viral protein, similar to other RNA respiratory viruses that may hijack p38 activity to promote replication. Given the homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the latter may employ a similar mechanism. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may induce overwhelming inflammation by directly activating p38 and downregulating a key inhibitory pathway, while simultaneously taking advantage of p38 activity to replicate. Therapeutic inhibition of p38 could therefore attenuate COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, a prior preclinical study showed protective effects of p38 inhibition in a SARS-CoV mouse model. A number of p38 inhibitors are in the clinical stage and should be considered for clinical trials in serious",

Similar to the SARS-CoV virus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 facilitates cell entry by attaching to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located on the cell surface [1] . ACE2 is present in multiple tissues and is highly expressed in the lungs and heart [2] . Given this distribution, it is unsurprising that Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and myocarditis are the primary causes of death in COVID-19 patients [3] . The cause of overwhelming inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 is unclear, however. One particular pathway that has been previously implicated in animal models of acute lung injury and myocardial injury is the p38 MAPK system [4, 5] .",

Ang II mediates its effects through p38 MAPK activation [10] . Ang 1-7 stimulation of the Mas receptor decreases p38 MAPK activation to attenuate inflammation [11] . The loss of ACE2 activity upon viral entry may therefore allow Ang II mediated activation of p38 to predominate in the lungs and heart as Ang 1-7 is downregulated. This allows unchecked inflammation and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof produces a positive feedback loop as p38 activation also upregulates ADAM17, a protease known to cleave the ACE2 ectodomain to further reduce local ACE2 protective activity [12] . It is worth noting that while the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is still being fully elucidated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, a recent study found that inhibition of RAS via angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may reduce all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients [13] . In another study of COVID-19 patients, Ang II levels were linearly associated with degree of lung injury and viral load, further implicating RAS imbalance in the COVID-19 pathogenesis [14] .",

Elevated p38 MAPK activity in the endothelium has been implicated in platelet aggregation, and arterial thrombosis, and apoptosis of endothelial cells, a clinical finding also shown in the histology of the aforementioned study [23] . Cardiac dysfunction in COVID-19 patients could partly be due to this endothelial dysfunction, or due to overactivation of p38 MAPK in infected cardiomyocytes, which has been shown to induce apoptosis, impair contractility, and increase fibrosis [24] . Additionally, elevated p38 MAPK levels are also implicated in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling, which are poor predictors of outcome in acute lung injury [25, 26] . These effects are not entirely unexpected as excessive Ang II signaling, which transmits through p38 MAPK, also produces similar effects. However, in this instance, both direct viral activation of p38 MAPK and overactive Ang II p38 signaling may combine to create severe clinical complications.",

The SARS-CoV-2 virus, like SARS-CoV and other RNA respiratory viruses, may directly upregulate p38 MAPK, perhaps for replication purposes. However, the unique viral entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 may also shut off disables a key counterbalancing mechanism employed by the cell to dampen p38 signaling through ACE2 activity. This combination may allow a perfect storm of unrestrained p38 MAPK activity, promoting inflammation, vasoconstriction, and thrombosis, while simultaneously benefiting the viral lifecycle. As such, p38 MAPK inhibition may be an appropriate treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is supported by a small preclinical study of SARS-CoV infection in a mouse model. Further preclinical trials should be performed to implicate elucidate the role of p38 activation in animal models of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, safe, and well tolerated tolerable p38 MAPK inhibitors that are already in clinical stages of development. These drugs should be considered J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof for could be readily repurposed in randomized, controlled trials enrolling in patients at risk for serious COVID-19 complications.",
