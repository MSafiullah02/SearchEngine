Yeast cells were grown on YPD or on synthetic minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, the appropriate auxotrophic supplements, 2% agar [for plates]) supplemented with 2% dextrose. Yeast was transformed with appropriate plasmids by the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on synthetic minimal medium. The bait plasmid and the pB42AD cDNA library were introduced into the yeast strain AH109 [GAL4 2H-3]. Two-hybrid screen and interaction assays were performed essentially as described in the protocol (Clontech) in the presence of 2% galactose and 80 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-galactopyranoside per liter. Prey plasmids were selected from yeast colonies giving a positive signal according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. False positives were eliminated by re-transforming the host AH109 [GAL4 2H-3] strain with pACT-cDNA library plus bait plasmid. Additionally, the pACT-cDNA was transfected in yeast strain PJ69-2A to check for autoactivation. The positive clones that contained cDNAs encoding 7a-interacting proteins were sequenced and analyzed using BLAST.",

            "text": "TPR motifs were first identified as protein interaction modules in cell division cycle proteins in yeast [21], [22]. They have now been shown to be ubiquitous and present in a number of functionally distinct polypeptides from a variety of different species. Different protein\u2013protein interactions are mediated by these motifs and the majority of TPR motif-containing proteins have been shown to be involved in processes as diverse as cell cycle control, transcription and splicing events, protein transport and protein folding, to name a few [23]. The TPR-containing protein, hSGT, was first identified and described as a cellular binding partner for the non-structural (NS) protein of autonomous parvovirus H-1. Interestingly, both H1-virus infection and transient expression of the NS protein result in modification (most likely phosphorylation) of hSGT [24]. A subsequent study showed that hSGT interacts with HIV-I Vpu and Gag proteins, with Callahan and co-workers postulating that hSGT plays a role in HIV-1 virus assembly or release [25]. Other binding partners of SGT include the growth hormone receptor [26], myostatin [27], heat shock cognate protein [28], and heat shock protein [29], and it has been speculated that SGT could also have a cochaperone function. Recently, it has been shown that SGT is present throughout the cell cycle and that depletion there-of leads to an increase in the mitotic index [30]. On the contrary, Wu and colleagues report that SGT is a pro-apoptotic factor and that knockdown of SGT expression in a hepatocarcinoma cell line protects against apoptotic stimuli [31]. It is clear that SGT has diverse functions within the different cell types and possibly plays a role in the life cycle of at least two human viruses.",

Western blots and IP blots were detected with mouse anti-SGT and mouse anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1B). SARS-CoV 7a-HA co-immunoprecipitated with both flag-hSGT (lane 4), as well as with endogenous SGT from Vero E6 cells (lane 5). 7a-HA was not detected when the unrelated antibody (lane 6) was used for immunoprecipitation. Our results showed that 7a-HA interacted specifically with SGT from both human and monkey cells.",

As a negative control untransfected Vero E6 cells were treated in the same way. Whereas 7a-HA showed a perinuclear localization (Fig. 3, middle panel), flag-hSGT was distributed to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected cells (left panel) and untransfected cells did not stain (not shown) with the antibodies. The cellular distribution of SGT is consistent with a report by Cziepluch and co-workers [24] who found that untagged rat SGT is detectable in cytoplasm and nucleus of FREJ4 cells. Thus, 7a-HA was found to partially co-localize with flag-hSGT in Vero E6 cells (right panel).

In fact, recently Liou and Wang [32] investigated the functional importance of the different regions of SGT. They confirmed previous reports that the N-terminus of hSGT (aa 1-90) is responsible for self-dimerization of the protein and that the TPR domain (aa 91-192) is important for interaction with different proteins. Furthermore, in in vitro studies the glutamine-rich C-terminus portion (aa 193-313) could interact with short peptide segments consisting of consecutive non-polar amino acids. Thus, to determine whether the TPR motifs played a role in the interaction between hSGT and SARS-CoV 7a, four hSGT deletion mutants were created (Fig. 4\nA). Binding of the hSGT mutants with 7a-HA was studied using immunoprecipitation assays in Vero E6 cells. Results showed that full-length flag-hSGT (aa 1-313), flag-hSGT\u0394C (aa 1-192), and flag-hSGT\u0394C3 (aa 1-158) interacted with 7a-HA in Vero E6 cells. On the other hand, flag-hSGT\u0394N1-2 (aa 159-313) and flag-hSGT\u0394C3-2 (aa 1-125) did not interact with 7a-HA (Fig. 4B). Also, the negative control flag-GST did not interact with 7a-Ha. Since only full-length and SGT mutants that contain TPR2 interacted with 7a, our results showed that TPR2 (aa 125-158) was essential for the interaction.",

In this study, the HA-tagged proteins HA-N, M-HA, and E-HA were used as previously described in [13]. Whereas, the N protein is responsible for packaging the RNA into the nucleocapsid, the M and E proteins are responsible for virus assembly. In fact, the co-expression of M and E in a baculovirus expression system was sufficient for the assembly of virus-like particles [33].

The accessory protein vpu has been shown to be essential in regulating viral particle release and viral load [34]. Interestingly, overexpression of SGT and subsequent association with vpu protein reduces the titre of virus released from HIV-1 infected cells [25]. The authors also reported that the in vivo interaction between gag and SGT was abrogated when vpu was overexpressed in cells, indicating an intricate relationship between SGT, the accessory protein and the major structural protein. In this study, we reported the interaction of SARS-CoV 7a with hSGT. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the interaction between a SARS-CoV accessory protein and a cellular protein. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent studies in VeroE6 cells. We concluded that TPR2 of hSGT (aa 125-158) was essential for the interaction between SGT and SARS-CoV 7a. We also showed that 7a interacted with SARS-CoV M and E. Based on recent reports, it is clear that the SARS-CoV accessory proteins are probably involved in various viral processes in vivo, including pathogenicity and infectivity. In showing that 7a interacted with SGT, a protein with many diverse and essential functions, our findings provided further evidence in support of this hypothesis. Our data raised the possibility that the interaction between SGT and 7a, and the latter\u2019s interaction with M and E which have been shown to be sufficient for VLP formation, could play a role in virus assembly or release from the cell. Understanding the biological significance of the interaction between SGT and 7a could possibly lead to the discovery of novel therapeutics in treating SARS-CoV infection.",
