            "text": "Despite progress made in early recognition and management, sepsis remains the leading cause of death accounting for more than 200,000 deaths every year in the United States [1]. Sepsis is nowadays defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction induced from the dysregulated response of the host to an infection [2]. This definition is coming from our better understanding of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis acquired in recent years. We have managed to understand that when sepsis develops not all patients react in a similar way; in some hosts a pro-inflammatory response prevails whereas in others an anti-inflammatory response emerges [3]. However, this distinction is not clear-cut in all patients. Everyday practice teaches that unfavourable outcome is due to the deterioration of the initial host response to progressive organ dysfunction. It is highly probable that the mechanisms underlying this deterioration are individualized from patient to patient. These mechanisms are poorly studied and their knowledge is mandatory for future immunotherapy studies.",

Ang-2 increases vascular permeability and mediates progression into shock [4] whereas endocan inhibits leukocyte migration in the lungs and kidneys [5].

More precisely, both were increased on development of ARDS and septic shock; Ang-2 was also increased on development of AKI (Fig. 4). No changes were found upon development of DIC (data not shown). Logistic regression analysis showed that any increase of endocan from baseline was independently associated with the progression into ARDS. A similar association was shown for the progression into septic shock with a trend towards statistical significance (Table 2).\n\n",

At the event of a systemic inflammation, the molecule is cleaved through the activity of cathepsin G of neutrophils and a 14 kDa polypeptide is generated at greater concentrations in patients with sepsis than in healthy volunteers [10] and also in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock than in patients with SIRS [9, 11]. Former studies have shown that this glycoprotein may be involved in the pathophysiology of an infection without its contribution been clearly defined. In a prospective study of 78 patients, serum endocan greater than 1.70 ng/ml was associated with the presence of bacteremia [12]. Our overall findings are in general agreement with those of recent studies enrolling a lower number of patients. These studies have explored the probable associations of admission endocan levels with the development of organ failures within two to five days. In a study of 48 patients with multiple injuries, 24 developed acute lung injury (ALI) and 24 did not. Admission levels of endocan in the ICU were lower among patients who developed ALI compared to those who did not [13]. A similar finding was described in 20 critically ill patients; admission serum endocan was lower among those who developed respiratory failure on day 3 [14]. Their findings may at first appear contradictory to ours. However follow-up measurements were missing so it could be hypothesized that serum endocan might increase on the day of respiratory failure.",

Instead, all enrolled patients had sepsis at baseline and the changes of circulating peptides between those improving and those worsening were compared. Our findings suggest that changes of circulating cytokines do not mediate progression of the clinical course of sepsis. Probably this is explained by the fact that upon deterioration of sepsis the patient is already at the state of immunosuppression where further cytokine production does not take place [17, 18]. Instead endocan and Ang2 are increased and this may also be interpreted as a key-playing role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and septic shock. From the practical aspect, it becomes evident that any increase of endocan is a surrogate of prediction for the overall deterioration of the patient.",
