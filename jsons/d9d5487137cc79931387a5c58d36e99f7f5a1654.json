            "text": "There is a growing appreciation that the regulation of the melatonergic pathways, both pineal and systemic, may be an important aspect in how viruses drive the cellular changes that underpin their control of cellular function. We review the melatonergic pathway role in viral infections, emphasizing influenza and covid-19 infections. Viral, or preexistent, suppression of pineal melatonin disinhibits neutrophil attraction, thereby contributing to an initial \"cytokine storm\", as well as the regulation of other immune cells. Melatonin induces the circadian gene, Bmal1, which disinhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), countering viral inhibition of Bmal1/PDC. PDC drives mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. Pineal melatonin suppression attenuates this, preventing the circadian \"resetting\" of mitochondrial metabolism. This is especially relevant in immune cells, where shifting metabolism from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, switches cells from reactive to quiescent phenotypes. Acetyl-CoA is a necessary cosubstrate for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, providing an acetyl group to serotonin, and thereby initiating the melatonergic pathway. Consequently, pineal melatonin regulates mitochondrial melatonin and immune cell phenotype. Virus-and cytokinestorm-driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses. Virus-and cytokine storm-driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The alterations in butyrate and LPS can promote viral replication and host symptom severity via impacts on the melatonergic pathway. Focussing on immune regulators has treatment implications for covid-19 and other viral infections.",

Often, as in the case of covid-19, there is little likelihood of developing a vaccine or antiviral within a year of the emergence of such a devastating infection. Utilizing or developing more generic antivirals is a significant challenge, given that viruses can vary considerably as to the their effects, including on the immune system. For example, a general antiviral requirement for influenza and covid-19 would be for a treatment that limits the initial innate immune-associated \"cytokine storm\" where evident, while also acting to increase the efficacy of the adaptive immune response. 2 However, for the Ebola virus, such initial dampening of the innate immune response is not so clinically relevant. Allowing for such variability in virus effects, melatonin has emerged as a top candidate for protection against an array of different viruses, including the coronavirus. [3] [4] [5] This would seem to arise from the close evolution of melatonin within the emerging mitochondria in the first single-cellular organsims, allowing melatonin to be intimately associated with mitochondrial function, and thereby with immune system regulation. 6 The interactions of our \"bacterial-driven\" coexistence with viruses have provided a \"War of the Worlds\" from which plant and animal evolution have emerged, and in which evolution has acted to tolerate and limit rather than annihilate. Melatonin is an important aspect of our interactions with viruses.",

At the time of writing, data from China and Italy indicate that the elderly are at far higher risk of covid-19 linked mortality, primarily as a consequence of ageingassociated conditions, such as cardiovascular, pulmonary, and diabetic disorders as well as in immune-compromised conditions. Melatonin has clinical utility in all of these health conditions, suggesting its utility in buffering against covid-19 interactions with these medical conditions. However, the interactions of the melatonergic pathway with viruses may be more complex than ameliorative effects on ageingassociated preexisting medical conditions. First, the melatonergic pathway is reviewed and how this pathway may interact with the effects of the influenza, covid-19, and other viruses. This has treatment implications as well as providing indications as to important future research on how an understanding of human physiological systems can provide treatment targets that regulate the impact of viral infections, including influenza, and covid-19 driven pathophysiology.",

Melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant and antiinflammatory that mediates many of its effects via the optimization of mitochondrial function.

However, variations in the NAS/melatonin ratio occur and have been largely ignored in previous research, with melatonin synthesis having been seen as the ultimate aim of the melatonergic pathway. A number of factors may act to regulate the NAS/melatonin ratio by a variety of mechanisms in different cell types, including O-demethylation/ cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19, CYP1B1, ATP, and the purinergic receptor (P2Y1), as well as intercellular glutamate and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) activation.

Severe influenza and covid-19 infections seem driven by an initial \"cytokine storm\", with the increase in proinflammatory cytokines acting to suppress pineal melatonin production. 29 This is the essence of the immune-pineal axis, 19 whereby proinflammatory cytokines act to signal the need for an ongoing immune response and thereby prevent its suppression by pineal melatonin.

It should also be noted that the \u03b17nAChR is expressed on the mitochondria outer membrane, suggesting more direct impacts on mitochondrial function, including in immune cells and in the regulation of mitochondria Ca2+ influx. 63, 64 Overall, shifts in the balance of the sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous systems may be another aspect of viral infections. This is another route whereby the viral regulation of the melatonergic pathway can act on wider systemic regulatory processes in a manner to increase viral severity and decrease host survival.",

All of these ligands can modulate immune responses to viral infection. 20,21 However, it is the activation of the AhR by kynurenine and kynurenic acid that more readily links the AhR to immune inflammatory activity, as shown in Figure 1. AhR activation by different ligands can result in some differential effects, complicating the understanding of AhR activation. The AhR is also differentially expressed over the circadian rhythm, thereby linking the AhR to variations in the immune response over the circadian rhythm. 22 As noted, AhR activation induces an increase in mitochondrial CYP1B1, thereby contributing to an elevated NAS/melatonin ratio. Given proinflammatory cytokine induction of AhR ligands, AhR activation is therefore an aspect of the \"cytokine storm\" that can follow viral infection, thereby contributing to suppressed serotonin and melatonin availability, whilst also having consequences for the regulation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway, including the NAS/melatonin ratio. A number of studies show the AhR modulates the antiviral immune response, including the prototypical coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus. 23 These authors show that the AhR is an important mediator of how this coronavirus modulates the host's immune response, leading to the expression of several effector genes, including TCDDinducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiPARP), which is required for maximal coronavirus replication. This study also showed that the AhR modulates macrophage and dendritic cell responses, including the levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1. 23 Other data show the different AhR ligands differentially modulate immunoglobulin (Ig)G and CD8+ T-cell responses to the influenza virus, with the loss of CYP1 attenuating AhR-driven effects on virusdriven immune responses. 20 Whether such AhR-driven effects are regulated by variations in the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway and NAS/melatonin ratio requires investigation, including as to the relevance of these AhR-associated pathways in covid-19 infection.",

The circadian impacts on mitochondrial metabolism have been most thoroughly investigated in immune cells. However, this would seem relevant to the regulation of metabolism in all cells. As such, the effects of viral infection on the circadian rhythm are intimately linked to alterations in mitochondrial metabolism and the nature of the immune response. Within this framework, the viral suppression of pineal melatonin will be intimately associated with concurrent alterations in the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway, and thereby with key aspects of mitochondrial metabolism.

The sirtuins are also an aspect of the circadian rhythm.37 Alterations in the levels and effects of cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial sirtuins are also evident in a number of viral infections, including within dendritic cells, which have an important role in regulating the patterned immune response.38 Generally, the sirtuins seem to be evolutionary conserved antiviral agents.39 Like the circadian rhythm, viruses may act to disengage sirtuins from their regular physiological processes.The evolutionary conserved relationship of melatonin-induced sirtuins is important to the maintenance of mitochondrial function, 40 highlighting another important aspect of normal mitochondrial function that viruses can disengage via the suppression of pineal and mitochondrial melatonin. 2.7 | microRNAs microRNAs (miRNA) are important mediators of cellular co-ordination, with each miRNA regulating up to 100 genes. Consequently, alterations in the regulation of miRNAs are another aspect of how viruses modulate immune and wider cell function. A number of miRNAs act to suppress YWHAZ/14-3-3\u03b6, including miR-7, miR-375, and miR-451, thereby suppressing the 14-3-3\u03b6 stabilization of AANAT and leading to a general inhibition of the melatonergic pathway. Increased miR-451 is one of the mechanisms whereby the influenza virus actsto regulate dendritic cells, and therefore patterned immune activity.41 The influenza virus also increases miR-7, 42 whilst miR-375 can have contrasting effects of viral survival and replication.43 Although miRNAs can influence multiple genes, the impact of quite distinct viruses on these mitochondrial melatonergic pathway regulating miRNAs would indicate an important role for this pathway in to how viruses can determine cellular function.",

These are two mechanisms whereby infection induced increases in gut dysbiosis/permeability can occur, with consequences for mitochondria and immune cell function, as well as for the severity of viral infections.There are a number of ways that the gut microbiome/permeability can be relevant to viral infection pathophysiology, including from a reduction in the gut microbiome-derived short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, to an increase in the levels of circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) arising from an increase in gut permeability.48 As the alterations in butyrate and LPS can impact mitochondrial function and immune system responses, including from changes in the regulation of immune cell mitochondria, such changes in gut processes provide another focus for viral interactions with wider body systems.Gut dysbiosis and increased gut permeability are intimately linked.

Butyrate is also a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, thereby allowing it have epigenetic regulatory effects that are relevant to viral infections. A number of HDACs act to regulate viral infections, with the inhibition of HDAC1 leading to a decrease in influenza-driven pneumonia infections. 50 The role of gut microbiome-derived butyrate, and the nutriceutical sodium butyrate, in the regulation of viral infections clearly requires further investigation. The increase in gut permeability driven by proinflammatory cytokines allows for an elevation in the levels of circulating LPS from the early phases of some viral infections. By activating toll-like receptor (TLR)2/4, circulating LPS can modulate the immune system, as well as many other cells. As most viruses first make contact with their host's mucosal surfaces, which are typically already colonized with bacterial microbials, bacteria-virus interactions are a long-established integral aspect of viral infections. 51 TLR4 activation by LPS potentiates the lethality of influenza virus infection in preclinical models by increasing proinflammatory cytokine production and the glycolytic metabolic reprogramming of dendritic cells, which the authors propose to be partly mediated by the induction of the TLR4 ligand, high-mobility group box (HMGB)1. 52 This is supported by other preclinical data. 53 Under conditions of increased gut permeability, intestinal epithelial cells increase HMGB1 release in exosomes, 54 suggesting that both circulating LPS and exosomal HMGB1 may contribute to viral lethality via increased gut permeability. The roles of LPS and HMGB1 require further investigation as to their influence on the course of different viral infections, 55 as clearly the levels of circulating LPS are far lower than in most preclinical experimental investigations. It also requires investigation as to whether a preexisting increase in gut permeability, as in many preestablished medical conditions or following psychological stress, interact with the pathophysiological changes induced by different viral infections. This has treatment implications, including the use of sodium butyrate, which maintains the gut barrier and attenuates the stress-induced increase in proinflammatory cytokines from mucosal mast cells that underpin psychological stress-induced gut permeability.56",

Melatonin may also have prophylactic utility, especially in people with preexistent medical conditions associated with suppressed pineal melatonin synthesis. Given the role of gut microbiome-derived butyrate and its nutriceutical equivalent, sodium butyrate, in the regulation of mitochondrial function, the melatonergic pathway and HDAC inhibition, does butyrate have a role in pathophysiology and treatment of viral infections? Are there any additive or synergistic interactions of melatonin and butyrate treatments in the management of viral infections, including in decreasing fatalities from influenza and covid-19 infections? 3 | CONCLUSIONS Overall, commonly affected processes in viral infections would suggest that the lack of an available vaccine and antiviral, and their impotence in the face of new viral mutations, should not necessarily lead to a management response that is solely dependent upon social isolation in order to decrease human mortality. A number of factors can act to inhibit the key cellular changes upon which viruses act, with melatonin being one such factor. The utility of melatonin is paradoxically under-appreciated, if not suppressed, by its ready availability, low cost, and very high safety profile. At the time of writing, there has been a significant impact of covid-19 on global economies. It would seem inappropriate to wait for the pharmaceutical companies to provide a targeted antiviral and vaccine in over a year's time, at which point covid-19 may well have mutated. As highlighted throughout, viral impacts on human physiology allows for the use of nutriceuticals and pharmaceuticals that may lower infection severity by targeting physiological processes. Melatonin is one such substance. Melatonin is actively inhibited by most viruses, indicating its importance in the regulation of viral infections. A further benefit of melatonin in the management of influenza and covid-19 arises from its utility in management of the array of preexisting medical conditions associated with viral-linked fatality. The potential benefits of sodium butyrate in the management of influenza and covid-19 infections include its immune suppressive and mitochon-",

If so, what are the relevant doses? Extrapolating from preclinical data would suggest that doses as high as 500 mg may be necessary to dampen the initial cytokine storm. Such doses are well tolerated in humans, but clearly require investigation in virus-infected patients. Does melatonin attenuate the downregulation of Bmal1 by the influenza, and possibly covid-19, viruses? Does pineal-derived melatonin and exogenous melatonin increase the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway in immune cells and other cell types, including during the course of viral infection? Preclinical data shows that maternal exposure to an AhR ligand can drive alterations in the immune response to viral infection in the offspring. 78 It requires investigation as to whether such transgenerational effects on the viral immune response involve alterations in the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway.
