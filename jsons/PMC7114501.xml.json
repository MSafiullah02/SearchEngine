            "text": "Methods to rescue infectious rabies virus (RV) entirely from cloned cDNA became possible in 1994 (Schnell et al., 1994). Reverse genetics technology has since improved (Inoue et al., 2003, Ito et al., 2003) and enabled the construction of replication competent (Foley et al., 2002, Hosokawa-Muto et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2010, McGettigan et al., 2003, McKenna et al., 2003, McKenna et al., 2007, Mebatsion et al., 1996, Wanjalla et al., 2010, We et al., 2010, Zhao et al., 2010) and replication constrained (Cenna et al., 2008, Cenna et al., 2009, Etessami et al., 2000, Gomme et al., 2010, Ito et al., 2005, Morimoto et al., 2005, Wickersham et al., 2007, Wickersham et al., 2010) RV vectors carrying foreign gene(s). One of the main merits of RV-based vectors is the high and stably targeted presentation of foreign genes integrated into the permissive region of RV genome, in the form of an extra transcription unit and in permissive cell lines complemented for replication constrained vectors. Other advantages of RV-based vectors include expressing transgenes at extremely high levels (Mebatsion et al., 1996), eliminating the major source of cytotoxicity (Dietzschold et al., 2008), genetically targeting infection to susceptible cells (Wickersham et al., 2010), and inducing strong humoral and cellular immune responses against infectious diseases especially which has no effective vaccines (McKenna et al., 2003). Previously, SAD B19 strain of RV was mainly and successfully used as a seed for the construction of viral vectors for generating live vaccines for HIV/SIV, HCV or SARS-CoV (Faber et al., 2005b, Faul et al., 2009, McKenna et al., 2003, Siler et al., 2002) and delivering cytokines as chemokines, cytochrome C, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 (Pulmanausahakul et al., 2001, Faber et al., 2005a, Faul et al., 2008, Zhao et al., 2009, Kuang et al., 2009). However, since even SAD B19 and its derivate SAD I16 were pathogenic when inoculated directly into mouse brains, further efforts to attenuate the virus are necessary (Vos et al., 1999, Mebatsion, 2001, Rasalingam et al., 2005). Therefore, in this report, the highly attenuated Chinese human RV vaccine strain CTN181 (Du et al., 2008) is recommended as a more suitable candidate seed strain for development of new viral vectors.",

In previous studies, the beta-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal), bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), green fluoresence protein (GFP), and firefly luciferase (luc) were used as reporter molecules to monitor the replication of recombinant RVs in vitro and/or in vivo (Conzelmann and Schnell, 1994, Mebatsion et al., 1996, Huang et al., 2010, Liang et al., 2010). However, there is need for a gene marker which can more easily and sensitively monitor the growth and proliferation of recombinant RV vectors. The Gluc possesses a natural secretory signal and upon expression is secreted from cultured mammalian cells into the cell medium in an active form, which allows for multiple samples to be assayed from the same transfected cells at different times. In addition, Gluc assay generates over 1000-fold higher bioluminescent signal intensity in cultured mammalian cells, compared to Firefly and Renilla Luciferases (Tannous et al., 2005). In this study, we investigated the feasibility of Gluc reporter assay for convenient, sensitive and temporal monitoring of the growth and proliferation of recombinant RV vectors.",

Gluc activities were used to indicate and compare the growth of different recombinant RV vectors in cell culture. Moreover, the best harvest time for the recombinant RV vectors were determined by the quantitative detection of Gluc expression.

Two subclones pBlue-R\u2032 and pUC19-R\u2032, which were designed based on the commercial vectors pBluescript II SK (+) and pUC19, facilitated the construction of recombinant RV vectors in our study because difficulties were faced in directly cloning the short Gluc gene (0.6 kb) into large RV vectors (replication competent vector was 15 kb and G-deficient vector was 13 kb). The BssHII and NheI sites in the G\u2013L IGR of CTN-GFP are not always suitable for cloning of transgenes. After transfection, a significant amount of RV granules was detected, which demonstrated that our established recombinant CTN181-based viral vectors could function well as predicted. In addition to the existence of virus granules, the RT-PCR results provided further evidence of marker gene expression in the transfected cells. Moreover, we found that the recombinant RV from rCTN\u0394G-Gluc without pVAX-G as an additional helper plasmid cannot infect fresh BSR cells while that from rCTN\u0394G-Gluc with pVAX-G can, when the recombinant RVs were propagated in MNA cells, which Is in accordance with the characterization of replication deficient RVs (Gomme et al., 2010, Etessami et al., 2000, Cenna et al., 2009).",

High-level expression of therapeutic genes or antigens of other pathogens may be necessary for optimal use.

The reason for this is not clear. The efficiency of rescued virus is affected by multiple factors (Inoue et al., 2003). Before the study, we suspected whether the nonpathogenic glycoprotein plays a role in the low rescued virus titer. Previous studies had shown that the attenuation of RV is associated with its ability to induce apoptosis in neuronal cells, and that the G protein is responsible for triggering the apoptosis cascade (Jackson and Rossiter, 1997). Unfortunately, the results from this study showed that the level of rescued virus titer was lowered even when the amino acid in G333 position of glycoprotein was mutated from nonpathogenic Gln to pathogenic Asp, which rejects our hypothesis.",
