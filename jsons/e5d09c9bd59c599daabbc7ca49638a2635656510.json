            "text": "This article focuses on the development of veterinary medicine in the industrial pig and poultry production sector. In the current context of controversies over the public problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the veterinary profession is tending to promote a model of preventive medicine that is supposed to reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock farming. However, veterinarians specializing in pig and poultry production (\"industrial vets\") have in fact been adopting such approaches to animal health for several decades. Based on 28 interviews with pig and poultry veterinarians practicing or having practiced in western France between the 1970s and the 2010s, the article aims to understand how such a form of professional expertise has developed, and the business model that underpins it. Contrary to public discourses which promote preventive approaches as a way to diversify professional expertise and to disconnect veterinary incomes from drug sales, it is indeed this economic model that has allowed the development of such approaches within industrial livestock farming. Modern strategies for reducing antibiotic use should therefore seek less to renew the professional expertise of veterinarians than to find new ways to valorize it economically.",

This is not the first time that it has had to face such a reflexivity test, even in recent history (in the British case, some historians even see a cycle-Woods 2011a), but recent literature produced by professional veterinary organizations shows the importance of what is currently perceived as a need for self-analysis and change (ONDPV 2018; VetFuturs France 2018) . There are several issues that might explain why this period is favourable to such a prospective assessment of veterinary futures. One of the most important concerns the controversies and public policies that have developed over recent years with regard to the issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which has directly challenged the economic and professional model of farm animal veterinary practices that were setting drugs (mostly antibiotics) up as a cornerstone of veterinary activity, as a source of both income and professional expertise.",

Although veterinarians have aroused the interest of certain historians and sociologists of professions, this has essentially been in relation to the analysis of this social group's process of professionalization (Berdah 2012; Mitsuba 2017) , its role in animal health or food safety policies (Woods 2011b; Enticott et al. 2011; Fortan\u00e9 2016, 2018) , the dynamics that contribute to its specialization (Gardiner 2014) or feminization (Surdez 2009 ), or finally to knowledge and professional practices in farm (Shortall et al. 2016; Ruston et al. 2016 ) and small animal medicine (Sanders 1994; Morris 2012) . As for the regulation of veterinary drugs, there are also several studies by historians on the vaccination of animals against major zoonoses or epizootic diseases (Woods 2004; Berdah 2018) , sometimes on the veterinary pharmaceutical industry (Corley and Godley 2011) , and more recently on the AMR issue (Kirchhelle 2018 ). Yet unlike the uses of human medicines that medical anthropology has been able to theorize and document for many years (Whyte et al. 2002) , the uses of veterinary medicines, i.e. the conditions under which they are prescribed, dispensed and used, are rarely studied, except in interdisciplinary literature from the field of veterinary sciences (Speksnijder et al. 2015; Coyne et al. 2016) .",

Using recent debates on the AMR problem, it proposes to examine the relationship between the development of professional veterinary expertise and of the drug market, based on the case of a specific segment of the profession, namely veterinarians specializing in industrial poultry and pig production in western France. It thus puts the AMR issue under a broader lens as it analyses ongoing changes within the veterinary profession not as potential consequence of recent measures aiming to reduce antibiotic use, but rather as a reason for the way the problem is now framed. Indeed, it is common to hear professional organizations or public authorities state that in order to reduce their economic dependence on antibiotic sales, vets must rethink their activity by favouring preventive approaches to animal health which would involve a diversified range of services and would contribute to placing vets in an advisory role with a holistic vision of livestock farming or even of the food supply chain (VetFuturs France 2018) . However, such a form of professional expertise, combined with a particular business model for the practices promoting it, is not fundamentally new. If it is at the heart of contemporary debates, it is because it is based and supported by far earlier dynamics that initially had nothing to do with AMR, but which used the opportunity of current controversies surrounding antibiotic use, sale and prescription to reinforce and legitimize a certain vision of veterinary medicine, based on preventive approaches to animal health.",

Firstly, because approaches to animal health that have developed in this field are very singular and characteristic of the intensive farming methods used in these sectors, particularly in the Brittany and Pays de Loire regions where a large proportion of the production is located. Indeed, a certain vision of preventive medicine was developed by pig and poultry vets in the 1970s and 1980s, even if the issue of this form of veterinary expertise has not always been raised in these terms. This article therefore aims to understand the professional knowledge, practices and economic model upon which this kind of expertise is based, and why the current AMR context is an opportunity to expand it (or at least attempt to). Secondly, pig and poultry vets make up an extremely small and autonomous segment of the profession (which makes it possible to draw up a fairly representative picture) although its homogeneity should not be overestimated. This article thus seeks to provide a thorough analysis of this very particular part of the veterinary profession, the specificities of which have almost never been addressed by the literature. Despite their small numbers, \"industrial\" vets are nevertheless an essential component of the profession, because they manage the health of an economic sector which supplies a considerable share of national animal production.",

After the Swann report in 1969, a series of measures to control the use of antibiotics as growth promoters 1 was nevertheless adopted in Europe, progressively separating the molecules used in agriculture and human medicine (Kirchhelle 2018) . But 20 years later, during the avoparcin crisis 2,3,4,5 these measures were considered ineffective (in the sense that they did not prevent the transmission of resistant bacteria between humans and animals) and the use of antibiotics as growth promoters was finally banned in the European Union in 2003 6 (Kahn 2016) .",

Indeed, in France, since the 1975 Act on veterinary pharmaceuticals, vets have had a dual monopoly on the prescription and supply of medicines (Hubscher 1999) .

On the one hand, they defended a measure that crystallized the debates around the years 2009-2013: the \"decoupling\" of prescription and delivery, which consists in applying the professional and economic model that prevails on the human drug market, i.e. reserving prescriptions to physicians and sales to pharmacists. Decoupling basically means forbidding veterinarians from selling pharmaceuticals, as is the case in countries such as Sweden or Spain (Fortan\u00e9 2016) . On the other hand, this coalition supported the concept of \"critically important antibiotics\", the principle of which is to reserve certain molecules, in particular the latest generations of antibiotics, for human medicine. From a political and institutional point of view, this period was extremely interesting because it put the spotlight on definitional and jurisdictional conflicts between different social groups for the control of the legitimate use of antibiotics. It finally ended in a relative victory for veterinarians who succeeded, at the end of an unprecedented mobilization, in reversing the stigma that human health stakeholders assigned to them. Indeed, vets have been able to impose the image of a profession that is not guilty of overusing antibiotics but which is instead accountable for their proper use. The notions of prudent, judicious, rational or responsible use, now widely used in AMR debates, are thus a social construct produced by conflicts between social groups for the definition of the legitimate use of antibiotics (Fortan\u00e9 2019) .",

In return, a stricter framework for the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry was implemented between 2014 and 2016: margins on the sale of antibiotics are now limited and the retail price of antibiotics must be the same for every client, 7 and antimicrobial susceptibility tests are mandatory for the prescription of critically important antibiotics. 8 But once again, the most important part of this victory certainly concerns the changes regarding the image of the profession. Indeed, veterinarians not only reversed the stigma and positioned themselves as guardians of antibiotics, they were also able to re-appropriate the problem by highlighting the way they could solve it. Without denying that the economic model of the profession was too financially dependent on antibiotic sales, and that antibiotic use may have been too prevalent in animal care in the past, vets started to defend the development of preventive approaches which would, according to them, be the only way to ensure the transition towards an economic and professional model guaranteeing responsible use of antibiotics. This view was reinforced and supported by farmers and public authorities who also called for the development of such approaches which are usually promoted by national AMR policies ( Fig. 1 ) in France and in other countries (Badau 2016; Piquerez 2019) . 9 At the heart of this new prospective narrative for the profession and its role in managing the AMR problem, we can observe the construction of a (supposedly) new conception of animal health, which is not based on a strictly clinical approach to diseases but on a holistic vision of animals and livestock farming (biosecurity, hygiene, nutrition, good husbandry practices, etc.). In the posters above, veterinarians are portrayed as the gatekeepers of such an approach, through their transversal role as \"health advisors\". This professional model, based on the knowledge and practices of preventive approaches to animal health, goes hand 7 Law for food, agriculture and forestry n\u00b02014-1170 of October 13th, 2014. 8 Decree no. 2016-317 of March 16th, 2016. 9 When public authorities and the veterinary profession began to conceive this campaign, a third poster was designed, saying: \"my vet is much more than a mere drug supplier, he is also a teacher! He prescribes the medicines I need \u2026 but above all he talks to my farmer to make sure that I am perfectly fed, sheltered and vaccinated\". However this poster was not retained for the campaign because of its relatively sensitive headline. in hand with an economic model where the incomes of veterinary businesses would be more diversified since these new \"health advisors\" would be able to monetize a wider range of goods and services (hygiene and nutrition products, bacteriological analyses, livestock audits, etc.) than just pharmaceuticals.",

And what I want is to work with professionals who are producing the animals we eat. Pig farmers (well, not all of them but most of them) have very good technical skills. Pig farming is a very dynamic sector, you never get bored! We often have to upgrade the farms to new standards so it's always evolving.

But what I do think about this kind of practice is that there is a lot of emergency and \"fire brigade\" work and I don't think that is very challenging. In pig production, we have been evolving for quite a long time because if we only do \"fire brigade\" work\u2026 well, farmers expect a lot more than that! And for us, that is also what's interesting. Pig farming is a batch production, so we have this tendency to always try to do something for the next batch, try to prevent future batches from getting the disease we have now.

This conception is closely linked to the two previous points. On the one hand, it refers to the professional proximity that veterinarians maintain not only with their clients but also with technical advisors, often employees of the co-operative to which the farmer belongs or sometimes of a feed mill company. Indeed, in pig and poultry farming, technical advisors play an important role as they visit the farms much more frequently than vets. Although their role should not involve animal health issues (but rather feeding, housing or husbandry practices), they tend to conceive these aspects as a whole, as do vets when they look at the technical factors (rather than biological and medical ones) of diseases. Animal health is thus the work of a professional trio, whose theoretically distinct roles often overlap, encouraging situations of cooperation and also sometimes conflict (Adam et al. 2017 ). On the other hand, and consequentially, this so-called epidemiological conception of animal health establishes a form of activity which is not limited to a clinical and individual approach to pathology but which, on the contrary, opens up professional expertise to areas often considered as not specifically veterinary, such as hygiene, nutrition, zootechnics or biosecurity.

Without necessarily following the epistemological principles of the \"animal turn\" promoted by certain branches of the social sciences (Guillo 2015) , which consists in analysing the way in which animals themselves shape human interactions or the socio-technical devices within which they take place (notion of \"animal agency\"), it must be noted that taking care of chickens or pigs has different implications than is the case with cattle, dogs or cats. Two elements seem central here and are directly related to the characteristics of pigs and poultry and the farming systems to which they belong. On the one hand, these animals have a relatively short lifespan: only about 30 days for a conventionally raised chicken (between 90 and 120 days in organic or label farming) and about 6 months for pigs (the sows being slaughtered after 2 or 3 years). It is therefore very different from a dairy cow that must remain healthy and productive for an average of 5 years, or pets that live 10 or 15 years, sometimes more. In these conditions, which obviously also depend on the economic structure of the agri-food industry, animal health becomes part of biological and temporal dynamics where the slightest disorder may have pathological consequences that might be seen as \"just-in-time diseases\", i.e. health issues directly related to, or shaped by, the sociotechnical and economic infrastructures (including the animal bodies themselves) within which they emerged (Allen and Lavau 2015) . On the other hand, the health of chickens and pigs is not considered individually, but rather from a population perspective. These are animals that are reared in batches and it is the group of animals that constitutes the epidemiological reference unit for both the vet and the farmer. In certain cases, particularly in poultry farms where the production cycle is very short, many decisions are therefore made not for the current batch but for the following one, in order to avoid repetition of the same problem.",

The mixed crop-livestock model was gradually being replaced by specialist farms which were developing through a twofold process of intensification (increased herd size, confinement and containment of animals, rationalization and (bio)technicization of husbandry methods such as genetics, feeding and pharmaceuticals) and industrialization (concentration and vertical integration of the food chain's stakeholders, and taylorization of farm labour) (Diry 1985) . This movement led to the emergence of new needs in terms of health management. Firstly, at that time veterinarians knew little about these animals in terms of medical knowledge or techniques (poultry and pig medicine was rarely touched upon in veterinary schools back then). Secondly, the confinement of animals in enclosed buildings led to outbreaks of disease, especially-but not only-infectious diseases which were unknown or at least whose management methods were no longer appropriate. A small number of vets then began to specialize in this type of production, viewing it as a promising and developing market.",

In the poultry sector, which is structured more around industrial groups than around co-operatives, there were more independent vets who were orienting their practices towards this type of clientele. What these veterinarians had in common was the conviction that they could no longer do their job in the traditional way, i.e. as emergency \"rural\" vets, alone or in partnership in small practices serving a diversified clientele (cattle farmers and pet owners in particular, with a few occasional interventions on poultry or pig farms). Moreover, they were convinced that their job was to accompany the development of intensive and industrial livestock farming by providing services adapted to the specific animal health issues of this sector, and that their own organization had to follow and mimic the development of the industry they were working for.

            "text": "Indeed, veterinary researchers from the SPP had developed a preventive approach to animal health called \"ecopathology\" that had considerable success among pig vets and farmers in the 1980s (Fortan\u00e9 2017) . It was mostly based on an epidemiological conception of animal health (disease outbreaks are related to multiple variables, particularly \"technical\", i.e. non-clinical ones), and was adapted to the specific issues and husbandry conditions of intensive livestock farming. In this regard, the type of preventive veterinary medicine which was developed at that time in France would seem to have similar characteristics to that which had flourished in the UK slightly earlier (from the 1950s to 1970s) (Woods 2013) : animal health has to be conceived at the scale of the herd (and not the individual animal), be articulated to non-medical matters such as feeding, housing and genetics, and integrate the economic issues of performance and profitability within the advisory support vets provide to their clients. The most important difference during the process of institutionalizing these preventive approaches in France and UK seems to be the role played by public authorities. While in the UK, the State firmly supported the development of preventive veterinary medicine as a way to accompany the modernization of British livestock farming, in France, except for the SPP which was partially founded by local authorities and State veterinary services, most of the preventive approaches that flourished in the 1980s were supported by the private engagement of pioneering vets trying to respond to the challenges of a growing industry and, in the meantime, to capture the market of \"industrial\" veterinary services. 12 All in all, the point here is not to say that contemporary pig and poultry vets are nowadays using the exact same techniques and knowledge of the preventive approaches developed in the 1970s and 1980s, or even to suggest that all industrial vets of that time were doing exactly the same. 13 It is rather to demonstrate that this type of veterinary medicine has at least a 30 to 40-year history in these sectors and that some aspects of this can still be seen in the way that modern industrial vets continue to work (and to perceive their job and professional identity), such as the importance of technical expertise, epidemiological knowledge and bacterial laboratory-in other words, that a diversified form of veterinary expertise is required. Even though this history has more or less vanished from the profession's official memory, a few unconscious vestiges of it can still be seen in recent AMR debates. For example, during the campaign promoting the AMR policy in the pig sector in 2014, an implicit link was made between this pioneering medicine and the kind of expertise which is now considered to be the future of the profession and through which veterinarians tend to legitimize their role as the guardians of antibiotics. This is demonstrated by the utilization of the ecopathology icon which expresses the holistic conception of animal health (namely the so-called \"Ploufragan hexagon\") to promote good veterinary practices in antimicrobial use in livestock (Fig. 2) .",

This famous diagram represents the way animal health (and economic performance of the farm) is conceived within the ecopathological framework: it is correlated to six variables, namely the farmer, the animal, housing, feeding, microbes and husbandry practices. At that time, it was considered quite innovative to claim that veterinary expertise should take into consideration all these aspects and not just focusing on animals and microbes (Fortan\u00e9 2017 ). 2-Prevention campaign against antibiotic misuse in pig farming, 2014. This poster used in the AMR campaign perfectly reproduces the six \"ecopathological\" variables (here referred to as the six \"pillars\" of animal health). It says: \"No more antibiotics than needed.

This poster therefore illustrates how preventive approaches within veterinary medicine are deemed to be a solution to reduce antimicrobial use profession), we can nevertheless rely on estimates from various literatures. A 1984 veterinary thesis on the structure of the drug market considered that drug sales were generating 30 to 40% of the income of farm animal practices (Rivi\u00e8re 1984) . Thirty years later, in the midst of the AMR debates, a report by the French Food, Agriculture and Rural Areas Council estimated this figure to be around 60% for farm animal vets in general, and up to 80% (including a high proportion of antibiotics) for industrial vets (Dahan et al. 2013, p. 20) . So one cannot help but wonder what happened during the three last decades and to what extent this evolution of the economic model of veterinary activity has in fact supported the development of preventive approaches to animal health, contrary to the prospective narrative the profession has constructed to defend its role as the guardian of responsible use of antibiotics.",

            "text": "The answer is actually quite simple, and is a classic case in agricultural economics: the sale of inputs funds the advice. In the case of industrial vets, the context in the 1980s and 1990s favoured the emergence of strong competition between practices seeking to capture the growing clientele of pig and poultry farmers. This competition was also heightened by the fact that the supply of veterinary goods and services was still highly heterogeneous, due to the non-existence of standardized pharmaceutical, hygienic or nutritional products adapted to the new health problems caused by the intensification of animal husbandry. Consequently, pharmaceuticals, which are the only product on which veterinarians have a monopoly for prescribing (and therefore advice) and dispensing (and therefore sales), became the main means of ensuring client loyalty. Since the 1975 Act, the veterinary drug market has thus been developing into a captive market, where drug sales have gradually become the only monetized exchange between vets and farmers, funding all the services actually offered by veterinarians (visits, diagnosis, analyses, prescription, audit, etc.) (Bonnaud and Fortan\u00e9 2018) . Indeed, preventive veterinary medicine developed on the basis of this economic model which corresponded, on the one hand, to that of the few pioneering independent practices which owned bacteriology laboratories, small drug manufacturing factories or wholesale companies and, on the other hand, to that of the agricultural co-operatives which the 1975 Act established as lawful drug suppliers and which, until 2007, employed veterinary practitioners in this regard. Indeed, it was precisely by providing a whole range of \"free of charge\" services (visits, advice, vaccination, etc.) that these vets were able to disqualify their competitors, i.e. their \"emergency\" or \"fire brigade\" colleagues who offered little advice but were able to monetize their occasional interventions.",

Because, even the independent vets specializing in group pathologies, so pig and poultry, like those from X [one of the pioneering veterinary practices in industrial medicine], most of the time, they did not charge for their visit, their visit was paid through drug sales. In fact, most farmers were smart enough to understand that if they were satisfied with the services of a vet or a veterinary practice, they should buy drugs to pay them indirectly, even if there were price differences. I think it was like this: \"You do me a favour, I need you, you treat, you prevent, we work together, I buy drugs\". It was indirect payment. (\u2026) I've always thought that the best way to ensure farmers' loyalty is to be efficient. Then they will not even talk about drug prices. There was a time when vets were very active on the farms. If farmers were happy with our services, [they didn't care about] the price of the drugs. At one point, we were a little cheaper but we weren't always cheaper. We were also known for being reasonably priced, so that there wasn't too much competition. Sure, we weren't the cheapest on the market, but that's not the issue. But I'm convinced, and I know that's the way it was for a lot of people, the best way to keep them was to meet their expectations. Their expectations were simple: \"I have problems, I have to solve them, help me solve them, if it takes time ok it takes time\". It was up to us to meet farmers' expectations in terms of health. If the farmer was satisfied, the rest would follow, he would take the feed, the genetics, the drugs. We had an indirect commercial role, but we could only do it if we were efficient. (\u2026) But some of them stopped buying our drugs. They told me: \"You're too expensive\". So I answered: \"If we are too expensive, you go elsewhere, but you no longer have the services\". What does he want? A cheap price, but with a service that will be what it will be, it may be very good, ok, but the farmer is free to choose. However, he fully understood that he could not ask us to come ten times a year or twenty times and then buy zero medicines. Moreover, I tell most people: \"we provide you with important services, we know that you also like to work with other people from time to time, at X for example, so don't buy everything from us, but buy a little from us, as we come to see you regularly and we need a return\". And then everything was fine, they bought some elsewhere and some from us.",

            "text": "The construction of a captive market is therefore a central dimension of what I call here \"the economic structures of professional expertise\". The development of preventive approaches within industrial veterinary medicine is not only the result of the emergence of new demands or needs from farmers, but it is also and above all the consequence of the intra-and extra-professional competition that veterinarians have had to face after the 1975 Act. Prescribing and dispensing pharmaceuticals, combined with a holistic expertise, is a means of capturing a clientele through a simple and exclusive form of economic contracting (the sale of drugs) while providing a wide range of services (diagnosis, advice, etc.). It is indeed the articulation of these two dimensions that makes it possible to prevent, or at least reduce the risk, that clients are captured by a competitor. In this sense, preventive approaches to animal health must be read simultaneously as a professional and a business model, these two dimensions being constitutive of each other. Such economic structures of veterinary expertise have been observed in another context, that of the USA in the 1950s and 1960s. Smith-Howard (2017) shows how American veterinarians, who did not have a monopoly on the sale of medicines, gradually established themselves as the main distribution channel by coupling their prescriptions with preventive services that provided real added value to farmers, compared with pharmacists or other retailers who were merely supplying the drugs. A linguistic distinction has even emerged between \"dispensing\" and \"merchandising\", contributing to (re)establishing the legitimacy of veterinarians on a new basis. In the end, it is therefore in the light of this link between professional expertise (in the sense of type of knowledge and services) and business model (in the sense of how these services are economically valorized) that we must question the current context and controversies surrounding AMR.",

In fact, the structure of the veterinary drug market has set up the sale of pharmaceuticals as a quasi-unique way of making professional expertise profitable, even though this expertise was already based on preventive approaches (and thus diversified services) for quite a long time. The current challenge for the veterinary profession is therefore less the development of a preventive medicine than the renewal of the economic model on which it has been based until now. In this regard, it is actually interesting to note that the vets I met in this study clearly mention this issue and have already started to develop strategies to deal with it.",

Overall, payment is made through [the purchase of] medicines, which is, for me, not a bad thing if it is not excessive. At some point, when we take the example of human medicine, you pay a doctor, you pay a pharmacist, everyone is happy because there is healthcare security. The day there's no healthcare security, I don't know what we're going to do. So that's what I explain to farmers: \"The day you have to pay a vet and a pharmacist it's going to cost double\". So at the moment, with this system, you only have one cost, so in theory that's good. Indeed, there can be misuse, someone who would systematically prescribe medicines even if there is no need. This is clearly an issue and it is difficult to explain, that's our problem. But honestly, every morning when I stand up, I don't say to myself: \"I will prescribe 10 kilos there, 15 kilos there and 5 kilos there, and the day is done\".

            "text": "A third strategy consists in developing various forms of contractualization with the clients. For example, the vet interviewed below tries to imagine an annual flat-rate model that would cover all veterinary services, from advice to medicines. This would be based on a form of insurance, where some farmers would ultimately pay a higher price than the actual cost of the services they have received, while others, particularly those facing more health issues, would pay a lower price (although the reverse might be true from one year to the next). In fact, this system is similar to the one set up by the so-called \"veterinary groups under contract\" in central and south-eastern France, but which was only developed in areas where livestock farming is not widespread i.e. in small and medium-sized cattle or sheep farms connected to local markets; this system is mainly associated with alternative agricultural projects resulting from 1970s protest movements (Combettes et al. 2012) . It would be interesting to know the extent to which such a model might be easily generalizable in the heart of an industrialized agri-food system where farmers are involved in more complex and constraining chains of interdependence with upstream and downstream industries. This trend resonates with certain dynamics currently observable in the UK where farm animal vets are also concerned about the sustainability of their economic model and are trying to develop similar forms of contractual veterinary services, although less than 10% of the clientele of the practices trying to develop these kinds of contractual schemes have adopted it so far (Ruston et al. 2016 ). The economic model and the type of goods and services that veterinarians can provide are nevertheless now considered to be key criteria for the sustainability of veterinary businesses (Henry et al. 2016) .",

It is of course an activity that has existed for a long time, but that many cooperatives delegated to their employed vets until 2007. The second activity relating to this strategy is linked with the development of new roles for veterinarians, in particular those of standards controllers or certifiers. Indeed, with the development of \"antibioticfree\" labels, more and more co-operatives are asking vets to help them implement such standards. For example, vets have to perform \"pharmaceutical audits\" in an attempt to recruit farmers who can comply with such specifications, or to set up protocols to monitor antibiotic use and help farmers reduce it.",

The AMR problem is a very interesting case-study through which to make such an articulation fruitful. Indeed, numerous works of research in the anthropology of medicines invite us to analyse drug use through the lens of the global circulation of pharmaceuticals and not just by focusing on the practices and knowledge of end-users, be they farmers or patients (Whyte et al. 2002; Petersen 2014) . Antibiotic use cannot therefore be disconnected from upstream practices (or pharmaceutical \"life stages\", as anthropologists of medicines would call them) such as production, distribution, prescription and sale. Though little is yet known about the structure of the veterinary drug market, we have shown that as key actors at the heart of the veterinary drug chain, involved in many areas of this global circulation of pharmaceuticals, veterinarians play a major role in the regulation of antibiotic use-particularly industrial vets who are not only involved in prescription and delivery but also in some cases in production and distribution. This result is therefore interesting from the point of view of the sociology of professions as it shows that the \"jurisdiction\" (Abbott 1988 (Abbott , 2005 of veterinarians is certainly more complex than them being mere practitioners of animal healthcare. Indeed, when we look at the veterinary profession as a whole it becomes quite obvious that veterinary knowledge is involved in many domains of animal health and food safety, from farm to policy and industry Fortan\u00e9 2016, 2018) . What this article shows, in addition to describing the specificities of a relatively unknown segment of the profession, is that this highly diversified form of professional expertise, and therefore the variety of areas in which it can be exerted, can also be concentrated within a tiny group of professionals, namely pig and poultry vets. Moreover, even though it still has to be more broadly demonstrated, it would seem that the trajectory of this particular segment, characterized by the development of specific approaches and economic models, is somehow quite representative and/or influential of more global changes that are now affecting the profession as a whole (at least in farm animal medicine). The expansion of the activity of industrial vets within the drug chain and the \"technical\" domains of livestock farming indeed corresponds to a (conflicted) evolution of veterinary jurisdictions that echoes the profession's ongoing attempts to renew itself in the context of AMR controversies. All in all, articulating reflections from the sociology of professions and the anthropology of medicines has allowed us to highlight the \"economic structures of professional expertise\" (that is to say that professional practices and knowledge are shaped by the way they are economically valued on a given market), which is of considerable importance for the analysis of the AMR problem.",

            "text": "Indeed, it underlines the fact that AMR cannot be addressed by simply focusing on antibiotic use or prescription and, more importantly, it shows that the framing of the AMR problem cannot be understood without reconnecting it with the global transformations of the veterinary profession (both in terms of expertise and business model). In this regard, we have shown that the veterinary profession has developed a prospective narrative to defend its role as the guardian of antibiotics (i.e. moving towards preventive approaches in order to prescribe less antibiotics and be less dependent on drug sales) that does not fully correspond to either the history or the actual practices of industrial vets. Such approaches have in fact already existed for many years and it is thanks to this diversified veterinary expertise that this segment of the profession has developed. However, the economic model upon which this expertise has been based is in fact the one which is nowadays criticized within AMR controversies (i.e. the sustainability of veterinary businesses being highly dependent on antibiotic sales), so that it would appear relatively doubtful, if not ironic, that the profession now brandishes preventive approaches as the undisputable solution to antibiotic overuse or misuse. Indeed, drug sales were almost the only way of monetizing veterinary services in the pig and poultry farming sectors and this is how the pioneering generation of industrial vets disqualified their traditional competitors, by \"enrolling\" clients through the development of a captive drug market. So although promoting preventive approaches is probably the right way to encourage veterinarians to move towards a \"health advisor\" role where antibiotics are neither the main tool of their activity nor the main source of their income, the profession still has to develop economic models (practice accountability, contractual arrangements with the clients, etc.) that do not rely on drug sales. Recent policy measures and incentives are probably pushing in this direction, as are broader trends such as the development of franchised practices and new professional roles and status, but this still has to be empirically confirmed (even though we know that over recent years antibiotic use has already started to decrease). Social sciences have a major role to play here, by being theoretically and methodologically innovative in order to grasp complex and entangled dynamics to which the AMR problem has just begun to draw attention.",
