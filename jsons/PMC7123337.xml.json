In early or mild inflammation, it may be watery (serous exudate) with low plasma protein content and few leukocytes. In more advanced inflammation, the exudate becomes thick and clotted (fibrinous exudate). When large numbers of leukocytes accumulate (Fig. 4.3), the exudate consists of pus and is called suppurative, while if it contains erythrocytes due to bleeding, it is referred to as hemorrhagic. Pus, accordingly, is a variant of exudate that is particularly rich in leukocytes, mostly neutrophils and parenchymal cell debris.\n\n",

Through chemoreceptors at multiple locations on their plasma membranes, the cells are able to detect where the highest concentrations of chemotactic factors are and to migrate in their direction. Granulocytes, including the eosinophils, basophils, and some lymphocytes, respond to such stimuli and aggregate at the site of inflammation. The primary chemotactic factors include bacterial products, complement components C5a and C3a, kallikrein and plasminogen activators, products of fibrin degradation, prostaglandins, and fibrinopeptides. Histamine is not a chemotactic factor but facilitates the process. Some bacterial toxins, particularly from gram-negative bacteria and streptococcal streptolysins, inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis [2, 3, 5].PhagocytosisThis defense mechanism is particularly important in bacterial infections. The polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages ingest debris and foreign particles.\n",

Abdominal surgery (particularly of the colon, appendix, and biliary tree) and trauma are the most common; less common are appendicitis, diverticulitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. The formation of fibrin in the abdominal cavity is a common pathophysiological pathway for abdominal abscess formation due to diminished fibrin degradation. Hyaluronan-based agents were found to reduce adhesion formation after surgery and reduce abscess formation in experimental peritonitis. Possible mechanisms of action of hyaluronan include modulation of the inflammatory response and enhanced fibrinolysis [7]. Low pH, large bacterial inocula, poor perfusion, the presence of hemoglobin, and large amounts of fibrin (which impedes antibiotic penetration) make the abscess a cloistered environment that is penetrated poorly by many antimicrobial therapies [8, 9]. Therefore, management of these infections requires prompt recognition, early localization, and effective drainage, as well as appropriate antimicrobial use. Once the diagnosis is made and the abscess is localized, treatment should begin promptly. Percutaneous or open surgical drainage should be used. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given until culture and sensitivity data are obtained. Localization is crucial since, for example, percutaneous drainage is inappropriate for abscesses in certain locations such as the posterior subphrenic space or in the porta hepatis. In the liver, abscesses occur in the right lobe in approximately 95 % of the cases, and in 70 % of cases, the liver abscesses are solitary [10].",

The two major types of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). Crohn\u2019s disease is also referred to as regional enteritis, terminal ileitis, or granulomatous ileocolitis. IBD is a disease of industrialized nations and observed most commonly in Northern Europe and North America. Incidence among whites is approximately four times that of other races, slightly greater in females and higher in Ashkenazi Jews (those who have immigrated from Northern Europe) than in other groups. The risk of developing UC is higher in nonsmokers and former smokers than in current smokers. Incidence peaks in the second and third decades of life. A second smaller peak occurs in patients aged 55\u201365 years. CD and UC can occur in childhood, although the incidence is much lower in children younger than 15 years with some differences in presentation and more negative effect on quality of life in younger age group [11].",

A great deal of research has been performed to discover potential genes linked to IBD. One of the early linkages discovered was on chromosome 16 (IBD1 gene), which led to the identification of the NOD2 gene (now called CARD15) as the first gene clearly associated with IBD (as a susceptibility gene for Crohn\u2019s disease). Studies have also provided strong support for IBD susceptibility genes on chromosomes 5 (5q31) and 6 (6p21 and 19p). None of these mechanisms have been implicated as the primary cause, but they are postulated as potential causes. The lymphocyte population in persons with IBD is polyclonal, making the search for a single precipitating cause difficult. The trigger for the activation of the immune response has not been defined. However, possible triggers include a pathogenic organism (unidentified yet), an immune response to an intraluminal antigen (e.g., cow\u2019s milk protein), or an autoimmune process with immune response to an intraluminal antigen and a similar antigen present on intestinal epithelial cells. In any case, activation of the immune system leads to inflammation of the intestinal tract, both acute and chronic [12\u201319].",

Oxalate in the lumen normally is bound to calcium. Calcium oxalate is poorly soluble and poorly absorbed; however, if calcium is bound to malabsorbed fatty acids, oxalate combines with sodium to form sodium oxalate, which is soluble and is absorbed in the colon (enteric hyperoxaluria). The development of calcium oxalate stones in CD requires an intact colon to absorb oxalate. Patients with ileostomies do not develop calcium oxalate stones.

The disease is now recognized as a member of a large family of granulomatous disorders and has been reported from all parts of the world. Current evidence points to genetic predisposition and exposure to yet unknown transmissible agent(s) and/or environmental factors as etiological agents [21]. The lung is most commonly and usually the first site of involvement, and the inflammatory processes extend through the lymphatics to the hilar and mediastinal nodes [22]. The lung is involved in more than 90 % of cases. Pulmonary sarcoidosis starts as diffuse interstitial alveolitis, followed by the characteristic granulomas. Granulomas are present in the alveolar septa as well as in the walls of the bronchi and pulmonary arteries and veins. The center of the granuloma contains epithelioid cells derived from mononuclear phagocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and macrophages. Lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, and fibroblasts are present at the periphery of the granuloma [23]. Sarcoidosis represents a challenge to clinical investigation because of its unpredictable course, uncertain response to therapy, and diversity of potential organ involvement and clinical presentations [24]. The diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical and/or radiological picture, histopathological evidence of noncaseating granulomas in tissue biopsy specimens, and exclusion of other diseases capable of producing similar clinical or histopathological appearances. Even microscopically, the noncaseating granulomas are not specific [21]. Infection by mycobacterial species other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis frequently leads to the production of noncaseating granulomas [25]. The condition is underdiagnosed in some areas. However, owing to the increasing awareness, it is being diagnosed more frequently than a few decades ago [26].",

In the developing countries, no decline has occurred [30]. Transmission is usually airborne. The pathological changes are predominantly in the lungs with an inflammatory reaction consisting of plasma cells of variable amount, monocytes, and histiocytes. This disease has also been reported in immunocompetent patients, and in this case the presentation is more closely resembling the disease of immunocompromised patients other than AIDS patients [31, 32].

This can occur by more than one way. Most often it occurs because of ascending infection from the lower urinary tract (Fig. 4.4). The initial colonization of the walls of the ureter is in areas of turbulent flow which leads to paralysis of peristalsis. Dilation and functional obstruction result in subsequent pyelonephritis. Another way is by direct reflux of bacteria. Hematogenous spread to the kidney by gram-positive and less likely by gram-negative organisms is the third way that can occur. This has become less prevalent since the advent of rapid use of antibiotics. Little or no evidence supports lymphatic spread.\n\n",

In a comparative study of rabbits with experimental abscesses, Bitar et al. [61] found that 111In leukocytes were clearly superior to gallium for imaging early abscesses. Furthermore, they found that the accumulation of 111In leukocytes in experimental subcutaneous abscesses was inversely proportional to the age of the abscess. In abscesses 1\u20132 h, 6\u20138 h, 24 h, and 7 days old, 10.4, 5.2, 3, and 0.73 % of the injected dose, respectively, was accumulated. 67Ga uptake, on the other hand, was not significantly affected by abscess age (Table 4.4). In abscesses 7 days old, 67Ga accumulated to a greater extent than did 111In-labeled leukocytes.

The authors also showed abscess-to-muscle ratios of 3,000 to 1 with 111In WBCs at 24 h compared with 72 to 1 with 67Ga and 7 to 1 with 111In chloride. Accordingly, a small dose of only 500 \u03bcCi of 111In leukocytes is sufficient for positive identification and localization of abscesses on an image. In 67Ga imaging, a higher dose of approximately 5 mCi is needed. There is a higher radiation dose to the spleen from 500 \u03bcCi of 111In WBC but radiation doses to gonads, marrow, and the whole body are higher with 5 mCi of 67Ga. 99mTc HMPAO-labeled WBCs could provide fast diagnosis and localization of the abdomen (within 2\u20134 h).

The 99mTc anti-NCA-90 Fab fragments can recognize a specific cross-reacting antigen (NCA-90) (the surface antigenic glycoprotein) on granulocytes, promyelocytes, and myelocytes [66\u201368]. LeukoScan uptake at the site of infection is explained partly by the migration of circulating antibody-labeled granulocytes to the site of infection. Uptake is also explained by the fact that the greater proportion of the labeled antibody fragment is in a free soluble form which can easily cross capillary membranes, binding to the leukocyte once in situ. This mechanism is favored by the increased capillary permeability at the site of infection. An important advantage of LeukoScan is the 5 min preparation time compared with the 2 h 30 min required by a specialized team for labeling leukocytes. Despite the fact that LeukoScan involves the i.v. injection of mouse proteins, no anaphylactic or other hypersensitivity reactions were observed.",

Inflammatory conditions show high FDG uptake which is related to increased glucose metabolism that is produced by stimulated inflammatory cells, macrophage proliferation, and healing [75]. While uptake of FDG continues to increase at malignant sites for several hours, as can be shown by an incremental increase of the standardized uptake values (SUV), inflammatory lesions peak at approximately 60 min, and their SUV either stabilize or decline thereafter. This difference in the behavior of FDG in malignant versus inflammatory cells can be explained best by the varying levels of enzymes that degrade deoxyglucose-6-phosphate in the respective cells. Glucose-6-phosphatase dephosphorylates intracellular FDG-6-phosphate, allowing it to leave the cell. It has been shown that most tumor cells have low levels of this enzyme, while its expression is high in the mononuclear cells [76\u201385]. For this reason, imaging at 2 time points after administration of FDG may prove to be important in differentiating between these two common disorders.",

In one study, 16 % of patients suspected of having abdominal infection in fact had extra-abdominal infections as seen on 111In leukocyte scans [95]. Accordingly, negative morphological modalities, when used first, may be followed by whole-body nuclear imaging. Labeled WBC studies are the most specific for acute infections (Figs. 4.11 and 4.12). Ga-67 is more suitable for infection of longer duration (Fig. 4.13). 99mTc HMPAO-labeled WBCs frequently are used in critically ill patients [39] after US and/or CT have yielded inconclusive results. It is worthy of note that 99mTc HMPAO-labeled WBCs provide quicker results than 67Ga- or 111In-labeled WBCs. Minoja et al. [96] reported a sensitivity of 95 %, a specificity of 91 %, and an accuracy of 94 % for 99mTc-labeled WBC scanning in intensive care unit patients with occult infections.

CT scanning and ultrasonography are best for demonstrating complications such as intra-abdominal abscesses and fistulas. Evaluation of the extent of the disease and disease activity is often difficult. A wide variety of approaches depicting the different stages of the inflammatory response have been developed. Nonspecific radiolabeled compounds, such as 67Ga citrate and radiolabeled polyclonal human immunoglobulin, accumulate in inflammatory foci due to enhanced vascular permeability. Specific accumulation of radiolabeled compounds in inflammatory lesions results from binding to activated endothelium (e.g., radiolabeled anti-E-selectin), the enhanced influx of leukocytes (e.g., radiolabeled autologous leukocytes, antigranulocyte antibodies, or cytokines), the enhanced glucose uptake by activated leukocytes (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose), or direct binding to microorganisms (e.g., radiolabeled ciprofloxacin or antimicrobial peptides). Scintigraphy using autologous leukocytes, labeled with 111In or 99mTc, is still considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d nuclear medicine technique for the imaging of infection and inflammation, but the range of radiolabeled compounds available for this indication is still expanding. Recently, positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose has been shown to delineate various infectious and inflammatory disorders with high sensitivity. In a study [98], gallium, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and PET-FDG were compared for their ability to detect disease activity. PET-FDG showed more than twice as many lesions in the abdomen of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease as did gallium. Not all lesions on MRI were FDG positive, suggesting they might represent areas of prior inflammation.",

Ultrasound has been used frequently to evaluate the kidneys with suspected infections, even though it is not sensitive. It is used primarily to screen for obstruction or abscess when resolution of UTI is slower than expected with treatment. The sensitivity of US has been shown to be less than 60 % [105] and is significantly inferior to that of cortical scintigraphy (sensitivity of 86 % and specificity of 81 % using 99mTc-glucoheptonate). Positive ultrasonography can obviate the need for DMSA; however, because of a large number of false-negative results with reported sensitivities of 42\u201358 % and underestimation of the pyelonephritis lesions, ultrasonography cannot replace 99mTc-DMSA [106]. To date 99mTc-DMSA is considered the most sensitive method for the detection of acute pyelonephritis in children (Fig. 4.16). It also permits the photopenic area to be calculated as the inflammatory volume which correlates with the severity of infection and the possibility of scar formation even though some of the defects detected might be too small to be clinically significant. Currently US is recommended as the initial imaging modalities by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in atypical and recurrent UTI in pediatric age group [107, 108]. The pathophysiological basis of the ability of Doppler sonography in detecting acute pyelonephritis is the fact that in the acute phase of pyelonephritis the, focal decrease of renal perfusion due to edema causes vascular compression, intravascular granulocyte aggregation, or both, leading to capillary and arteriolar occlusion facilitating the detection of these hypovascular areas [109].\n\n",

False-negative results have been reported in infections present for more than 2 weeks. More rarely, such false-negative results occur for infections present for only 1 week. Gallium-67 is less specific than labeled WBCs, as it is taken up by many tumors and by sterile inflammation. Several radiolabeled antibody preparations and a radiolabeled antibacterial agent have been introduced and evaluated, but none of these have been used widely. Labeled antibody scintigraphy uses antigranulocyte agents, most commonly intact murine immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against normal cross-reactive antigen-95 (anti-NCA-95, 99mTc-BW250/183, 99mTc-besilesomab [Scintimun\u00ae]) and the murine Fab fragment of the IgG antibody directed against the glycoprotein cross-reactive antigen-90 (anti-NCA-90, 99mTc-sulesomab, LeukoScan\u00ae). 99mTc-IgG scintigraphy is a highly sensitive technique for the recognition of infection but has a low specificity PET-FDG has now taken the place occupied by citrate of Gallium-67. Visualization of inflammatory lesions does not just rely on the presence of immune cells, but uptake requires the activation of these immune cells. FDG-PET reveals infectious and noninfectious inflammatory diseases as well as malignant diseases; all are causes of fever of unknown origin. Recent studies support the use of FDG-PET in the patient with FUO [72, 73, 110]. FDG is sensitive and its short half-life does not delay the performance of any additional radionuclide studies that might be needed.\n\n",

Understanding pathophysiological changes also helps the nuclear physician to recognize and explain the scintigraphic patterns of inflammatory conditions (Table 4.7 summarizes common examples).
