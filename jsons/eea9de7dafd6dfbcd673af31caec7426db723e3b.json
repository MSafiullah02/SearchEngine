Quebec is the only province with specific legislation that mandates all people have a duty to come to the aid of someone in peril. Case law also suggests there is a legal duty to care for patients you have not yet met if you are specifically designated to care for that group of people (e.g., an emergency department physician or a physician on call). 9 Some emergency physicians are employees of a hospital rather than independent contractors, and each province will have legislation that outlines the circumstance under which they may be legally allowed to refuse what they believe is unsafe work. As well, many provinces have emergency legislation that provides the authority to designate health care providers as \"essential services,\" thereby legally compelling their time and work, although this would likely be a last resort if faced with a shortage of available providers. 10 The Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA) has said that the professional obligations and legal principles that usually apply to all physicians continue in the context of COVID-19, that physicians have a legal duty to ensure everything they do for their patients meets the standard of care of a reasonably competent physician in similar pandemic circumstances, and that physicians still must meet the obligations set out in policies by their respective colleges. 11 ",
