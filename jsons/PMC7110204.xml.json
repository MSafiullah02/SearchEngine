The resulting guinea pig\u2013adapted strain gives rise to high plasma viremia (typically >1\u00d7105 pfu/mL) and is highly lethal to guinea pigs, typically causing death 7\u201312 days after challenge. Infection experiments were performed under biosafety level (BSL)\u20134 biocontainment. Research was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statues and regulations relating to animals and to experiments involving animals and adhered to the principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [15]. The BSL-4 facility used is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Noninfectious mouse and guinea pig clearance and biodistribution experiments were conducted at Protiva Biotherapeutics, in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care",

We used Vero cells because they lack the structural genes for IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 [20\u201322], thus precluding any confounding effects of these cytokines. At various time points after transfection (0, 24, and 48 h), the transfected cells were infected with ZEBOV. Cells and culture fluids were harvested 24 h later, to determine the level of virus production. The results showed that the siRNA pool inhibited the production of infectious ZEBOV 2\u201310-fold, depending on when the transfected cells were infected (figure 1). By immunofluorescence antibody staining, we were able to demonstrate a mean \u00b1 SD reduction of 83%\u00b114% (P=.006, Student\u2019s t test) in the numbers of cells expressing EBOV protein (figure 2).

Although both mouse and guinea pig models are available for ZEBOV infection [14, 23, 24], we chose to use guinea pigs for these experiments because (1) they appear (on the basis of evaluation of coagulation changes [25, 26]) to reproduce human filoviral infection slightly better than mice and (2) there are no mouse models available for other filoviruses, whereas guinea pigs have been used to study the Sudan species of EBOV [27] and as models for infection with several strains of the EBOV-related Marburg virus [28, 29]. In the first in vivo experiment, guinea pigs were treated with either the L gene\u2013specific siRNA pool (n=5) or the irrelevant scrambled sequence (n=5), which were mixed with PEI and injected retroorbitally 3 h before the ZEBOV challenge; the guinea pigs then received equivalent doses of the siRNAs (8 mg/kg) at 24, 48, and 96 h after the ZEBOV challenge. A significant reduction in plasma viremia (P=.02) was demonstrated on day 4 after challenge in the guinea pigs receiving the L gene\u2013specific siRNA pool, compared with that in the guinea pigs receiving the irrelevant scrambled sequence (figure 3). All of the control guinea pigs treated with the irrelevant scrambled sequence died or were euthanized by day 12 after challenge, whereas 1 of the guinea pigs treated with the siRNA pool survived and the other 4 guinea pigs either died or were euthanized on day 10, 13, 13, and 14, respectively",

Rather, treatment was initiated 1 h after the challenge, and additional treatments were administered daily on days 1\u20136 after infection. Plasma viremia levels, which peak on day 7 in this guinea pig model [14], were not detected on day 7 in any of the guinea pigs treated with the siRNA pool but ranged from \u223c3.5 to 4.5 log10 pfu/mL in the control guinea pigs (figure 5A). One guinea pig treated with the siRNA pool died on day 6, most likely because of toxicity, given that we were unable to demonstrate the presence of infectious ZEBOV in this animal. Another guinea pig from this treatment group had to be euthanized on day 26; this death could not be attributed to viral replication either. The remaining 3 guinea pigs treated with the siRNA pool did not show any evidence of illness and survived the ZEBOV challenge, whereas all 5 of the control guinea pigs died or were euthanized by day 13 (figure 5B)",

Strikingly, all of the SNALP-formulated siRNAs, including the irrelevant scrambled sequence, induced IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in the serum of the injected mice (figure 7). Both the guinea pigs and mice that were treated with the immunostimulatory SNALPs showed symptoms of systemic toxicity, including a transient decrease in body weight and piloerection (data not shown), that have previously been shown to be associated with siRNA-mediated stimulation of the mammalian innate immune system [13, 36]. These adverse effects were not evident in the control animals treated with PBS or in the animals injected with empty liposomes or naked siRNA. Of note, EK1, which conferred the greatest benefit when used to treat ZEBOV-infected animals, was the least immunostimulatory of the siRNAs examined.

Although a number of postexposure treatments have shown promise in rodent models of EBOV HF [39\u201341], none has shown any success in nonhuman primates. To date, the only postexposure treatment that has been shown to protect nonhuman primates after challenge with ZEBOV is a strategy designed to modulate the manifestations of disease rather than to block replication of the virus; in a study in rhesus monkeys [42], we demonstrated that a postexposure strategy to mitigate the coagulation disorders that typify EBOV infection improved survival from 0% to 33%.

            "text": "Although there is no assurance that the SNALP-based siRNA strategy described here will protect against EBOV infection in the more-rigorous nonhuman primate models, there is reason for optimism in light of comparative data from historical studies. Specifically, as noted above, several previous studies have shown complete postexposure protection of mice [39, 40] and guinea pigs [41] against a lethal ZEBOV challenge; however, in each of these cases, the rodents were not protected against viremia. Subsequent transition of these strategies to nonhuman primates was uniformly unsuccessful in protecting macaques against a lethal infection [43, 44]. This suggests that the inability to completely inhibit viremia in rodents predicts an unfavorable outcome in nonhuman primates. In the present study, after administration of the EK1 siRNA, we were unable to detect viremia in any of the ZEBOV-challenged guinea pigs. Clearly, this observation does not guarantee success of the SNALP-based siRNA approach in nonhuman primates; on the other hand, it does offer some hope that the prospects for success are at least improved",
