We applaud the EANM and the authors for the goal of providing guidelines to the nuclear medicine community with helpful information, along with offering strong clinical background, interpretation direction, and a focus on quality for patients. It is well known in the nuclear medicine community that ventilation/perfusion studies are an important tool in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism (PE). Pulmonary embolism is a serious disease, which can have potentially significant consequences. The previous version of the guideline [2, 3], issued in 2009, has been cited by other organizations in the appropriate use of ventilation/perfusion scanning for diagnosing pulmonary embolus [4] and in policy recommendations [5]. It is this wide-spread attention to the previous version of the guideline that makes it important that this update of the guideline, which in addition to being comprehensive and addressing changes in interpretation, should be balanced. Such a comprehensive review and update is important to patients, policymakers and practitioners alike.",

In the body of the updated guideline, it clearly states, \u201cVentilation can be evaluated with the 99mTc-labelled aerosols, DTPA and Technegas\u00ae, or krypton gas (81mKr)\u201d [1]. There is a reference cited which compares 99mTc-labeled carbon particles and 99mTc-DTPA in a clinical setting [6]. This reference includes two separate pa/tient groups: group (a) 35 patients in one group who were referred to evaluate clinically suspected PE (29 patients), evaluate alveolitis (3 patients), or evaluate lung function before surgery/lung transplant (3 patients); and group (b) 30 consecutive outpatients with known COPD. The results from this study have limitations that are often not thoroughly considered including that the key observation applies particularly to patients with obstructive disease, and an additional suggestion for more study in the obstructive group since some of the criteria used were developed for patient populations in whom acute PE is clinically suspected. The study showed that both 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-labeled carbon particles identify the presence of PE in non-obstructive disease patients when the pre-defined criteria are applied [6]. A published study, which includes a comparison between the radioactive gas (81mKrypton) and the radioaerosol (99mTc-DTPA), reports that regional diagnostic information is similar for each radiotracer for the scintigraphic diagnosis of PE [7].",

Both the updated guideline and the editorial seem to overlook improvements that have evolved with nebulizers, which have produced smaller size droplets than older nebulizers. The value of using the best available nebulizer to reduce central deposition and hot spots which may limit interpretation was recognized in the previous guideline [2]. One equipment manufacturer, for example, has described a nebulizer which produces droplets with a median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) as small as 0.28 mcm [9].",

The comparison study (Jogi, 2010) cited above presents the radiation dose from the 99mTc-DTPA +99mTc-MAA study, when combined for a 1-day V/P study as 1.5 mSv compared to a radiation dose from the 99mTc-labeled carbon particles +99mTc-MAA study when combined for a 1-day V/P study as 1.8 mSv [6]. The radiation exposure from either of these V/P procedures is much lower than the radiation exposure with CTPA [1]. From the dosimetry perspective, for 99mTc-labeled carbon particles the critical organ is the lung (0.11 mGy/MBq), while the critical organ for 99mTc-DTPA is the bladder (0.047 mGy/MBq) [1].",

Some may see the shorter biological half-life as an advantage leading to faster clearance and to lower radiation exposure including to the lung, as well as providing clinical information regarding alveolo-capillary permeability, while others may see it as a potential disadvantage for obtaining certain image sets and measurements of COPD.

If interfering particle deposition occurs, consider additional diagnostic options\u201d [10]. According to the updated guideline, hotspots with 99mTc-labeled carbon particles are seen in some patients with severe airway obstruction [1]. Also, in describing pitfalls in image interpretation of V/P SPECT, the updated guideline comments that on rare occasions in patients with emphysema 99mTc-labeled carbon particles are trapped in bullae in which perfusion is absent. This causes a pattern that may be mistaken for a mismatch [1]. Further, the updated guideline observes uneven aerosol distribution and reduced 99mTc-labeled carbon particles penetration in grade 2 COPD patients as well as impaired 99mTc-labeled carbon particles penetration to the periphery and a central deposition in large airways, usually with large areas of reduced/absent ventilation in grade 3 COPD patients [1].",

The instructions for these journals, for example, recommend that the generic name should be used throughout a publication.
