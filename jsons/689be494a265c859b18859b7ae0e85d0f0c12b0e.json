During this time, professional medical societies have provided guidance regarding the care of COVID-19 patients, including precautions during intubation/extubation, patient transport to the OR, care of the anesthesia machine and equipment, among others. With regard to appropriate decontamination of the operating room, both the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have recommended following current CDC guidance of using EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectant from List N. 2 A recent article on perioperative infection control also made specific evidence-based recommendations such as designating and maintaining clean and dirty areas, treating operating rooms with UV-C, using longer staff shifts, performing one case in each OR daily, with terminal cleaning after each case. 6 Another consideration is the specific use of negative pressure rooms. When bearing in mind safety precautions in these discussions, it is important to remember the benefit of a negative pressure room is to protect individuals outside the room from an infectious contaminant in the room. The design is not to protect the provider/caregiver in the room. Therefore, this should not impact the decision around implementing a pause.",

In this area, both the ASA and APSF state that \"Upon patient leaving the room, entry should be delayed until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove aerosolized infectious particles.\" 7 During the pandemic, some hospitals have instituted this \"pause\" after intubation and extubation; however, there are several questions to consider before recommending widespread adoption of this practice. As with any improvement changes, local barriers to implementation exist, as well as consideration benefits and consequences. In the short term, initiating this change may not pose significant challenges and may be advantageous.

Waiting after intubation and extubation also reassures the operating room staff that safety is a priority. Furthermore, this precautionary measure may reduce the usage of personal protective equipment. Another consideration is whether to implement this practice in only COVID-19 or PUI patients or expand it to all patients, given the known risk of asymptomatic viral shedding. Until widespread rapid testing becomes available, some may consider a pause for all cases, which affects operating room efficiency. Indeed, challenges to sustaining a pause for COVID patients in the long term include effects on operating room delays and efficiency.",
