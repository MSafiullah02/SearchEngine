Therefore, the other LC3 homologs might also localize on the PVM of T. gondii. The antibody that we used was known to detect the major form of LC3 (LC3B) preferentially.11 To investigate the potential localization of LC3 homologs on the PVM of T. gondii specifically, we cloned all known protein coding transcripts of LC3 homologs in the murine system (namely LC3A, LC3B, LC3B-1, LC3B-2, GABARAP, GABARAP-1, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2) into a lentiviral plasmid that expresses N-terminal FLAG and HA epitope-tagged proteins (Fig. 1A). Upon transduction and selection of wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (WT MEFs) with lentiviruses expressing individual LC3 homologs, we examined the expression of the LC3 homologs and their localization with regard to the PVM of T. gondii. Three of the 8 cloned LC3 homologs were not expressed well for some unclear reason (Fig. S2A). However, the other 5 cloned LC3 homologs were expressed reliably in the transduced MEFs (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our previous observation of the endogenous LC3,11 all LC3 homologs were detected on the PVM of T. gondii in the absence of IFNG-mediated activation of the cells (Fig. S2B). In the cells activated with IFNG, they colocalized with the IFNG-inducible GTPases (TGTP1/IRGB6 as a representative of IRGs) on the PVM of T. gondii (Fig. 1C). Although there was a concern that epitope-tagging of LC3 might affect its localization on the PVM,11 at least our tagging system that adds \u223c40 amino acids at the N terminus did not significantly affect the localization of LC3B on the PVM of T. gondii (Fig. S2C). Furthermore, IFNG augmented the localization of epitope-tagged LC3 homologs on the PVM of T. gondii in the transduced MEFs, as it does for endogenous LC3 (Fig. S2D).11 These data demonstrated that not only the major LC3B, but also all LC3 and GABARAP subfamily members localized on the PVM of T. gondii.\n\n",

Although its expression level was comparable to that of WT (Fig. 2A), LC3BG120A did not localize on the PVM of T. gondii in contrast to the WT LC3B (Fig. 2B). Further, we generated WT MEFs stably expressing the nonconjugatable mutants of GABARAP (GABARAPG116A), GABARAPL1 (GABARAPL1G116A), and GABARAPL2 (GABARAPL2G116A). Similar to LC3BG120A, they were expressed well but did not localize on the PVM of T. gondii (Fig. 2A and 2B).

However, there is a significant discrepancy between LC3 and the IFNG-inducible GTPases localizing on the PVM of T. gondii (for example, compare Fig. 3A and B).11 These data further suggest that the recruitment of LC3 and the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the PVM of T. gondii might be spatially and temporally regulated for efficient targeting and disruption of the membrane structure of the pathogens.11 Therefore, we next examined the role of LC3 homologs in targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the PVM and consequent control of T. gondii infection by IFNG. Since only Lc3b knockout cells are currently available,18 we performed knockdown of the remaining LC3 homologs stably with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and transiently with small interfering RNA (siRNA). First, to investigate the role of the LC3 subfamily, we transduced Lc3b WT and KO MEFs with lentiviruses expressing shRNA against red fluorescent protein (Rfp, as control) or Lc3a. Upon drug selection of the transduced cells, the cells were further treated with IFNG and infected with T. gondii, and we monitored targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the PVM of T. gondii and control of T. gondii infection by IFNG. The substantial knockdown of Lc3a transcript and the knockout of Lc3b did not significantly affect targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases (TGTP1/IRGB6) to the PVM of T. gondii (Fig. 3B) and control of T. gondii infection by IFNG (Fig. 3C). Second, to investigate the role of the GABARAP subfamily, we transfected the Lc3b WT MEFs with either pooled control siRNAs or pooled siRNAs against Gabarap, Gabarapl1, and Gabarapl2 together. Again, the substantial knockdown of Gabarap (reduced to 14.1% \u00b1 4.0), Gabarapl1 (reduced to 29.1% \u00b1 5.1), and Gabarapl2 (reduced to 23.7% \u00b1 4.4) transcripts (Fig. 3D) did not significantly affect targeting of the IFNG- induced GTPases (IIGP1/IRGA6 and TGTP1/IRGB6) to the PVM of T. gondii (Fig. 3E) and control of T. gondii infection by IFNG (Fig. 3F). Of note, none of the knockout and/or knockdown of LC3 homologs significantly affected the infectivity of T. gondii for the cells (Fig. S3).\n\n",

Thus, to determine the role of the entire group of LC3 homologs, we transfected pooled siRNAs against the Gabarap subfamily to the Lc3b KO MEFs transduced with shRNA against Lc3a. RNA interference against LC3 homologs led to knockdown of Lc3a (reduced to 20.8% \u00b1 3.5), Gabarap (reduced to 9.0% \u00b1 1.8), Gabarapl1 (reduced to 15.4% \u00b1 2.2), and Gabarapl2 (reduced to 30.7% \u00b1 4.0) transcripts (Fig. 3G). In that condition, we observed significantly less targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases (IIGP1/IRGA6 and TGTP1/IRGB6) to the PVM of T. gondii, compared to the pooled control siRNAs (Fig. 3H). Consistently, we also observed significantly less control of T. gondii infection by IFNG in the cells expressing significantly less LC3 homologs (Fig. 3I). These data suggest that both subfamilies of LC3 homologs function analogously in recruiting the IFNG GTPases to the PVM of T. gondii and consequent control of T. gondii infection by IFNG. It is noteworthy that both LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies are essential for autophagosome biogenesis but act in different stages of autophagy \u2014 the LC3 subfamily in elongation of the phagophore membrane, whereas the GABARAP subfamily in a later stage of autophagosome maturation.19 In addition, recent studies further support the distinction between those 2 subfamilies with respect to their autophagic functions.20-23 In contrast to the distinct autophagic functions of LC3 homologs, these data suggest that all LC3 homologs play an essential but overlapping function for targeting of the IFNG GTPases to the PVM and subsequent inhibitory effect on T. gondii infection.",

We asked whether the localization of LC3 homologs on a membrane, other than the PVM of T. gondii, is sufficient to recruit the IFNG-inducible GTPases to that alternative membrane. The most direct way to test this possibility would be to conjugate an LC3 homolog to a target membrane after removing all the other LC3 homologs inside a cell, and to investigate the recruitment of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to that target membrane. Currently, such a cell line lacking all known LC3 homologs does not yet exist. Thus, we reasoned that changing the localization of the ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1 complex might be the best practical way to test the possibility. The ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1 complex determines the conjugation site of LC3: its plasma membrane-localizing version, generated by tagging a 17 amino acid KRAS-CAAX motif (KRAS-CAAX: KDGKKKKKKSKTKCVIM) to the C terminus of an ATG16L1 mutant (ATG16L1[1\u2013249]), redirects LC3 conjugation mostly to the plasma membrane where the ATG16L1 mutant predominantly localizes.10 Therefore, we took the same approach in our system, expressing the ATG16L1 mutants with added C-terminal KRAS-CAAX motifs in Atg16l1 KO MEFs and examining targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the plasma membrane.",

Interestingly, when the same mutants were expressed with the C-terminal KRAS-CAAX motif in Atg16l1 KO MEFs, the lipidation of LC3 was detected constantly only in the cells with ATG16L1(1\u201379)-KRAS-CAAX (Fig. 4C). In contrast, we did not find a substantial restoration of LC3 lipidation by the ATG16L1(1\u2013249)-KRAS-CAAX mutant through a whole cell population analysis using western blot. It was previously shown that the transient overexpression of the ATG16L1(1\u2013249)-KRAS-CAAX mutant substantially increases the lipidation of LC3 in wild-type cells, especially with additional ATG12\u2013ATG5.10 The discrepancy between the 2 systems might be explained by the heterogeneous low-level expression of the lentivirally-transduced genes in the polyclonal cell population. Alternatively, the KRAS-CAAX-mediated membrane anchorage of ATG16L1(1\u2013249) might significantly decrease the dimerization/interaction capacity of ATG16L1 in the absence of wild-type ATG16L1 or its function to bring the ATG12\u2013ATG5 conjugate and the associated E2 ATG3-LC3 to a target membrane in the absence of extra ATG12\u2013ATG5. Conversely, the C-terminal KRAS-CAAX may anchor the ATG5 binding domain (1\u201379) of ATG16L1 on a membrane in a conformation that enables the domain to skip the necessary protein-protein interactions for the LC3 conjugation.",

In contrast, the mostly membrane-anchored ATG16L1(1\u2013249)-KRAS-CAAX did not restore the control of T. gondii infection by IFNG (Fig. 4D) and restored inefficiently targeting of LC3 and the IFNG-inducible GTPases (TGTP1/IRGB6 and GBP1 through GBP5) on the PVM of T. gondii in Atg16l1 KO MEFs (Fig. 5B), probably because it was anchored on membranes other than the PVM of T. gondii (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, the ATG16L1(1\u2013249)-KRAS-CAAX mutant was able to recruit both LC3 and the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the plasma membrane, where it is anchored (Fig. 5A and B). Further, there was substantial overlap between the LC3 and the IFNG-inducible GTPase on the plasma membrane (Fig. 5C and D). These data suggest that the mutant could restore the lipidation of LC3 at least locally even in the absence of substantial restoration of LC3 lipidation at a whole population level (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these data demonstrated that the LC3 conjugation system of autophagy is not only necessary for targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the PVM of T. gondii but also sufficient to target them to an alternative membrane.\n\n",

We developed a mitochondrial anchor by fusing TOMM20 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20)31 to the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 6A). As the target, we constructed a fusion protein of ATG16L1(1\u2013249) with FK506 binding protein (FKBP) domain and RFP. Since the FKBP and FRB domains form a heterodimer in the presence of rapamycin,30 the target with FKBP domains translocates to the mitochondria outer membrane where the anchor with FRB domains localizes. Thus, the cytoplasmic target (RFP-ATG16L1[1\u2013249]-4\u00d7FKBP) translocated to the mitochondria upon its heterodimerization with the anchor (TOMM20-2\u00d7FRB-GFP) on mitochondria by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 6B).\n\n",

As a control, in the absence of the target, we did not detect any colocalization of LC3 with the anchor on mitochondria (Fig. S4A). Intriguingly, we observed a significant increase of LC3 localization on mitochondria upon IFNG treatment and T. gondii infection, which is reminiscent of the increased localization of LC3 on the PVM of T. gondii upon IFNG treatment11 and also the augmented localization of LC3 on the plasma membrane (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the interaction between the ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1 complex with LC3 and/or the conjugation of LC3 on a membrane by the ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1 complex can be substantially enhanced by IFNG treatment and T. gondii infection. By comparison, IRG (IIGP1/IRGA6 as a representative) did not colocalize with the target in the cytoplasm upon induction by IFNG, but occasionally colocalized with the target on mitochondria upon treatment with rapamycin. It was upon T. gondii infection that IIGP1/IRGA6 significantly colocalized with the target on mitochondria, suggesting that targeting of the IRGs to a membrane by the LC3 conjugation system was modulated by T. gondii infection (Fig. 7A and B). Although the same effect of T. gondii infection was not observed in the KRAS-CAAX-mediated plasma membrane localization of IRG (TGTP1/IRGB6), the localization of GBP1 through GBP5 on mitochondria in the anchor-away system (Fig. 7B) and on the plasma membrane in the KRAS-CAAX system (Fig. 5B) were also augmented by T. gondii infection. Consistent with LC3, in the absence of the target, we did not detect any colocalization of the IFNG-inducible GTPases with the anchor on mitochondria (Fig. S4A). In addition, we did not detect any significant effect of rapamycin treatment on the expression of the IFNG-inducible GTPases in our experimental condition (Fig. S4B). Taken together, our data clearly demonstrated that the LC3 conjugation system could direct LC3 and the IFNG-inducible GTPases to a target membrane, and further suggest that the targeting is augmented by IFNG and T. gondii infection.\n\n",

In canonical autophagy, the LC3 conjugation system is required to elongate the phagophore membrane while capturing cytoplasmic cargoes and eventually to form a closed globular autophagosome.32 In this noncanonical function, the same functional module is required to mark a membrane structure of an intracellular pathogen with the ubiquitin-like LC3 homologs and to recruit effector proteins to the \u201cLC3-marked\u201d membrane.

The first question is how the PV is recognized as a target membranous structure for the ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1 complex to conjugate LC3 homologs. Since ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1 specifies the conjugation site of LC3 homologs,10 the complex must be recruited to the PVM of T. gondii before the conjugation of the LC3 homologs. The ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1 complex may be associated with the membrane of the PV of T. gondii directly through the membrane-binding activity of ATG533 and/or indirectly through potential interaction partners of ATG16L1 on the membrane.27,28 For canonical autophagy, WIPI2B (WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2B) recruits the ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1 complex to the site of autophagosome initiation via its binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) on the site and its interaction with ATG16L1.28 Although we did not observe any significant role of PtdIns3K in the control of T. gondii by IFNG upon its inhibition with wortmannin or LY294002 in our previous study,11 it is noteworthy that the PVM of T. gondii can be rapidly bound by GFP fused to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of AKT, which can recognize a membrane containing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(3,4)P2.34 These data suggest that the phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol in the PVM of T. gondii, presumably other than PtdIns3P, may recruit the ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1 complex onto the membrane through effector proteins that can bind to the phosphoinositides and interact with the complex, similar to canonical autophagy initiation.",

            "text": "The second question is how the IFNG-inducible GTPases are targeted specifically to the LC3-marked PV, for instance, instead of being targeted to LC3-decorated autophagosomes. If the IFNG-inducible GTPases are targeted to the LC3-decorated autophagosomes, they may disrupt the autophagosomes and consequently inhibit the degradative autophagy process. In fact, there have been a couple of reports showing that the mouse and human homologs of IRGs are associated with autophagy proteins and involved in canonical degradative autophagy.38-41 However, the IRGs in those reports promote the formation of autophagosomes rather than disrupting the autophagosomal membrane. Since the human IRG system differs significantly from the mouse IRG system, it has been unclear whether the human IRGs play a role in controlling T. gondii infection similar to the mouse IRGs.42-44 In contrast, the role of mouse IRGs in disrupting the PV of T. gondii has been clearly demonstrated by many groups,16 and as shown here the targeting of the mouse IRGs can be determined by the LC3 conjugation system. Nevertheless, we have not observed any significant colocalization of mouse IRGs with autophagosomes (unpublished) and any significant effect of IFNG on canonical degradative autophagy,45 suggesting that mouse IRGs are not targeted to autophagosomes. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the mouse IRGs are indeed targeted to LC3-decorated autophagosomes but do not disrupt the autophagosomes due to the physical difference between the double membrane of the autophagosome and the single membrane of the PV of T. gondii.",

We occasionally detected weak interaction between the IFNG-inducible GTPases and LC3 homologs only in IFNG-treated and T. gondii-infected cells (unpublished). Our data shown in Fig. 7 clearly demonstrated that the recruitment of the IFNG-inducible GTPases by the LC3 conjugation system to a certain target membrane was significantly augmented by T. gondii infection. Further, we also observed that expression of individual IFNG-inducible GTPases alone did not lead to their targeting to the PV of T. gondii (unpublished), suggesting that IFNG-inducible changes, more than simple expression of the IFNG-inducible GTPases, are necessary for proper targeting of the IFNG effectors onto the PVM of T. gondii. However, since the fully functional IRG system (so consequently the GBP system too) requires the expression of most (if not all) IRG proteins,35-37 we cannot rule out the possibility that IFNG may be simply required to induce the expression of those GTPases. Nevertheless, these data suggest that cellular signaling events induced by IFNG and T. gondii infection may substantially modify the interaction between the LC3 homologs and the IFNG-inducible GTPases. IFNG treatment and T. gondii infection modulate many cellular signaling pathways and induce a large transcriptional change in the treated and infected cells.15,34,47 Further, various post-translational modifications of LC3 homologs have been reported.48-51 We speculate that LC3 homologs are post-translationally modified upon IFNG treatment and T. gondii infection so that they can specifically recruit the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the membrane of the PV either directly or indirectly.",

            "text": "LC3 was initially thought to be a marker only of autophagic degradation because it was conjugated only on phagophore membranes, which are destined to be delivered to the lysosome and to be degraded following lysosomal fusion. Now LC3 has been shown to be conjugated on many non-autophagosomal membrane structures, which are involved in trafficking of cargoes to more than the lysosome.6,7,52 Furthermore, our data suggest that LC3 can serve as a molecular beacon to recruit effector proteins to the membrane where it is conjugated and thus to modify the fate of the membrane itself rather than the cargoes inside the membranous structures. Simply, LC3 conjugation to phospholipids on a membrane may modify how the membrane interacts with other molecules in a cell. As far as we know, LC3 homologs are the only known proteins that are directly conjugated to phospholipids on a membrane and consequently modify the membrane. Thus, it is very tempting to speculate that the conjugation of ubiquitin-like LC3 homologs to phospholipids (in membranes) can function like the conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins. Ubiquitination was initially known as the marker of protein degradation through the proteasome.53 Since then, ubiquitination has been shown to modify the stability, trafficking, and protein-protein interaction of ubiquitinated proteins.54 Future studies will illuminate the parallel and divergent natures of the LC3 and ubiquitin conjugation systems, as well as shed light on other, yet undiscovered participants.",

For siRNA-mediated transient knockdown, we purchased the following products from GE Dharmacon: siGENOME non-targeting siRNA Pool #1 (D-001206-13-05), SMARTpool siGENOME siRNA against Gabarap (M-041776-01-0005), Gabarapl1 (M-040444-01-0005), and Gabarapl2 (M-059605-01-0005). All siRNAs were dissolved in siRNA buffer (GE Healthcare, B-002000-UB-100) and transfected into cells using DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent (GE Healthcare, T-2001-02). Specific target sequences of all shRNA and siRNAs used in this study will be available upon request. For quantification of transcripts upon knockdown, RNAs were extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, T9424) and reverse transcription was performed using IMPROM-II reverse transcriptase (Promega, A3803) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Primers for qPCR are as follows: Lc3a (5\u2032-gaccgctgtaaggaggtgc-3\u2032, 5\u2032-cttgaccaactcgctcatgtta-3\u2032), Gabarap (5\u2032-aagaggagcatccgttcgaga-3\u2032, 5\u2032-gctttgggggctttttccac-3\u2032), Gabarapl1 (5\u2032-ggaccaccccttcgagtatc-3\u2032, 5\u2032-cctcttatccagatcagggacc-3\u2032), Gabarapl2 (5\u2032-ggaacacagatgcgtggaatc-3\u2032, 5\u2032-gatgtccgaggggaccaagta-3\u2032).",
