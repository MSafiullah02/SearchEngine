Therefore, it is likely that cells benefit from redundant mechanisms to detect and limit viral infections. Recognition of viral nucleic acids by intracellular Toll-like receptors (TLRs) entails the early steps of the immune response elicited during viral infections. 1 For the past 10 years, efforts have been made to define the role of TLR3 in the antiviral response and to elucidate at the molecular level the TLR3 pathway as a 'major sentinel' against viruses. In contrast to TLR7, which recognizes single-strand (ss) RNA (therefore its role could be restricted to certain types of RNA viruses), TLR3 has, at least in principle, the ability to play a crucial role in the antiviral response against most viruses by its ability to sense double-stranded (ds) RNA, a common intermediate of replication among many viruses. 1 Intriguingly, dsRNA of non-viral origin and, in particular, endogenous mRNA and RNA released from necrotic cells have been shown to trigger the TLR3 pathway. 2, 3 Toll-like receptor 3 is broadly expressed and well conserved among vertebrates and its expression has been confirmed in immune and non-immune cells. 4 A functional antiviral role of TLR3 against certain viruses has been demonstrated in various human and murine cells as well as in the mouse model (recently reviewed in ref. 5) . Interestingly, TLR3 has been implicated in licensing myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) for cross-priming of CD8 T cells in the mouse, and a certain subset of human DCs that highly express TLR3 exhibit a better capacity for cross-presenting apoptotic and necrotic cell antigens after TLR3 stimulation. 6 Indeed, at least in part, the strategy of using TLR3 ligands as adjuvants in vaccine therapy is based on the selective high expression of TLR3 in human CD141 + DCs and mouse CD8a + DC subsets. In contrast to the beneficial roles of TLR3 in antiviral response and cellular immunity, emerging evidence suggests that TLR3 also mediates pathogenesis, which may or may not be directly related to the exacerbation of the antiviral response. This review provides background on the TLR3 pathway, highlights the negative regulation of TLR3 signalling by endogenous and virus-encoded proteins, and discusses emerging evidence on the detrimental contribution of TLR3 in viral pathogenesis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 329, "end": 330, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 883, "end": 884, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1045, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1047, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1198, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1374, "text": "5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1675, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The TLR3 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum of unstimulated cells, and upon dsRNA stimulation, it traffics to endosomes to encounter its ligand through a pHdependent mechanism that also requires TLR3 dimerization. 7 The interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein UNC-93B and TLR3 is crucial for TLR3 trafficking and signalling. 8 In addition, recent structural studies have demonstrated that the length (at least 45 bp) and structure of dsRNAs play critical roles in TLR3 recognition and signalling. 9 Emerging evidence suggests that TLR proteolysis by asparagine endopeptidase and cathepsins in endolysosomes may represent a general regulatory strategy for all TLRs involved in nucleic acid recognition. 10 The TLR3 proteolytic processing regulates stability and endosomal localization, but its role in TLR3 function remains poorly understood. 11 Furthermore, TLR3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the endosome is essential for recruiting the adaptor protein Toll-interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein interferon-b (IFN-b) (TRIF) to the TIR domain of TLR3. This is in contrast to other endosomal TLRs (TLR7-9) that do not require tyrosine phosphorylation, possibly owing to their MyD88-dependent, TRIF-independent signalling. To recruit TRIF upon recognition and dimerization, Tyr 759 and Tyr 858 residues in the cytoplasmic domain of TLR3 are sufficient for downstream signalling when phosphorylated. 12 Two studies have reported a differential role for the tyrosine kinases c-Src 13 and epidermal growth factor receptor 14 in mediating TLR3 phosphorylation. These studies support the current model that after dsRNA stimulation, TLR3 binds epidermal growth factor receptor before c-Src does. Interestingly, epidermal growth factor receptor is required for Tyr858 phosphorylation, and Src is required for Tyr759 phosphorylation. In addition, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Bruton's tyrosine kinase have been implicated in TLR3 phosphorylation. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase is required for the full activation of IFN regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB), 15 but its role in TLR3 signalling remains to be determined. Bruton's tyrosine kinase directly phosphorylates the Tyr759 residue of TLR3. 16 In Bruton's tyrosine kinase-deficient macrophages, TLR3-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase, AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and activation of NF-jB, IRF3, and activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors are all defective. 16 Triggering TRIF recruitment by TLR3 dimerization and Tyr phosphorylation results in the stimulation of the transcription factors IRF3, NF-jB and AP-1 through two branches. NF-jB activating kinase (NAK) -associated protein 1 mediates TRIF association with the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) together with TRAF family member-associated NF-jB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IjB kinase e (IKKe) complex, which subsequently promotes the phosphorylation, dimerization and translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus. 17 The second branch drives the activation of NF-jB and AP-1 and is mediated by the protein kinase receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase TRAF6, which interact with TRIF and recruit TAB2 (TAK1 binding protein 2), TAB3 (TAK1 binding protein 3), and TAK1 (transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1). This branch results in the activation of the IKK complex (nuclear factor-jB essential modulator, IKKa, IKKb), the MAPK pathway, and further activation of NF-jB and AP-1, 18 respectively.

Sterile aand armadillo-motif-containing protein (SARM) is a TIR domain-containing adaptor that has been shown to inhibit TRIF, resulting in down-regulation of TRIF-dependent cytokine and chemokine induction 28 and AP-1 activation through the MAPK pathway. 31 TRIF is also involved in the TLR4, MyD88-dependent signalling pathway, and the adaptor translocating chain-associated factor 3 (TRAM) mediates TRIF recruitment. TAG (TRAM adaptor with GOLD domain), a splice variant of TRAM, is an adaptor that negatively modulates TLR4-TRAM signalling from endosomes by displacing TRIF, so inhibiting the signal transduction. 32 Interestingly, integrins may play a role in the regulation of some TLRs. The integrin CD11b activates Syk and promotes degradation of TRIF via the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b. 33 Triad3A is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that modulates TLR3 signalling by degradation of the TIR domains of TRIF and RIP1. 34 Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins and, in particular, TRIM38 have been identified as novel negative regulators of the innate immune response. TRIM38 expression is enhanced after TLR3 stimulation and negatively regulates TLR3-mediated type I interferon signalling by targeting TRIF for proteasomal degradation. 35 Importantly, TRIM38 negatively regulates TLR3/4-and RIG-I-mediated IFN-b production and antiviral response by targeting NF-jB-activating kinaseassociated protein 1 (NAP1) 36 and TRAF6. 37 Finally, a novel role for ADAM15 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) as a negative regulator of TLR3 and TLR4 signalling by a mechanism involving TRIF degradation has recently been identified. 38 TRAF3 assembles Lys 63 linked polyubiquitin chains and forms a protein complex with TBK1 and IKKe, then binds to TRIF and acts as a mediator of the IRF3 activation, which results in the phosphorylation of IRF3. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are proteases that specifically cleave ubiquitin linkages, negating the action of ubiquitin ligases. De-ubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA) selectively cleaves the polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3, resulting in its dissociation from the downstream signalling complex and the reduction of the type I IFN response. 30 Interestingly, MIP-T3 has been suggested to function in the cilia to facilitate infection with viruses that preferentially infect the apical ciliated side of the respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia by compromising innate immunity, 39 although this hypothesis requires further investigation. The negative role of MIP-T3 in the production of type I IFN by inhibition of TRAF3 complex formation is unique as MIP-T3 appears to affect TRAF3 ubiquitination only slightly but is capable of preventing TRAF3 from engaging downstream transducers. 39 The RIP1 kinase is negatively regulated by RIP3, Triad3A and A20. Meylan and colleagues have shown that RIP3 inhibits RIP1 by competition, down-regulating the TRIF-RIP1-induced NF-jB pathway. 40 Similarly to DUBA, A20 is a de-ubiquitinating enzyme that has been found to act in the cytoplasm as a negative regulator of TLR responses, affecting RIP1 and TRAF6 and thereby terminating TLR-induced NF-jB signalling. 41 In addition, A20 interacts with TRIF and inhibits TLR3-and Sendai virus-induced activation of IFN-sensitive response element and IFN-b promoter, suggesting that A20 is a virus-inducible protein that blocks both inflammatory and cellular antiviral responses. 42 A variety of negative regulators affect TRAF6, a signal transducer shared by the TRIF and MyD88 axis. TLRs other than TLR3 depend on the adaptor protein MyD88, and its activation from different sources converges in the recruitment of TRAF6. Therefore, it is not surprising to find several molecules that interact with and tightly regulate TRAF6. In addition to A20, 27 TRAF6 is negatively regulated by the DUB tumour suppressor cylindromatosis, which negatively regulates the TNF receptor-induced activation of NF-jB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase by reversing ubiquitination of its target and possibly by a transient interaction with nuclear factor-jB essential modulator. 43, 44 Activation of NF-jB and AP-1 leads to production of pro-inflammatory signals as well as cylindromatosis. Therefore, it generates an autoregulatory loop that controls the immune response through TRAF6. TANK (also known as I-TRAF) has been identified as a TRAF-binding protein. The presence of TANK in unstimulated cells mediates the inhibition of TRAF6 by blocking its ubiquitination. TANK seems to negatively regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production, rather than the IFN response induced by TLR signalling. 45 TRAF6 is also regulated by Pellino-3, a family of proteins that have been shown to be subject to various forms of post-translational modifications. It was demonstrated that TRIF signalling induces its expression, and through its E3 ubiquitin ligase capability, Pellino-3 inhibits TRAF6 and further activation of IRF7, resulting in down-regulation of type I IFN expression. 46 A potent negative regulator of TRAF6 is the ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4), which plays an essential role in modulation of the TLR/IL-1R signallingmediated innate immune response by cleaving ubiquitin linkages in a DUB activity-dependent manner. 47 Similarly, the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner is a transcriptional co-repressor that regulates hepatic metabolic pathways and has been found to inhibit TLR signalling by regulating the polyubiquitination of TRAF6. 48 The nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) proteins serve as regulators of inflammatory signalling pathways. The mitochondrial NLRX1 protein interacts with TRAF6 and inhibits NF-jB activation. Upon TLR stimulation, NLRX1 dissociates from TRAF6 to allow its function. 49 NLRX1 is an important regulator of the antiviral response against RNA viruses,because it also counteracts the RIG-I-MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein) cytoplasmic pathway. 49", "cite_spans": [{"start": 358, "end": 360, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 407, "end": 409, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 769, "end": 771, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 946, "end": 948, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1068, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1380, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1554, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1568, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1764, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2313, "end": 2315, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2554, "end": 2556, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2861, "end": 2863, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3056, "end": 3058, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3277, "end": 3279, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3538, "end": 3540, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 4212, "end": 4215, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 4216, "end": 4218, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 5107, "end": 5109, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 5362, "end": 5364, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 5598, "end": 5600, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 5892, "end": 5894, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Endogenous regulators"}, {"text": "In the previous section, we described a number of endogenous negative regulators that target TRIF, TRAF3, RIP1 and TRAF6, thereby controlling the signalling cascades mediated by TLR3 stimulation to protect the host from potentially harmful, excessive immune activation. During co-evolution with the host, viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract cell responses against infection for their own benefit and diminish the immune response at multiple levels. Here we discuss the various strategies that some viruses have developed to negatively regulate the TLR3 pathway by targeting TRIF, TRIM38, TRAF3, TRAF6 and RIP1 (Table 2) . One viral strategy to interfere with the TLR3 signalling pathway is to down-regulate the expression of the adaptor TRIF. Some viral non-structural proteins with serine protease activity have been identified to target TRIF for proteolysis. The NS3/4A of hepatitis C virus (HCV), 50 the hepatitis A virus (HAV) protease-polymerase processing intermediate (3CD), 51 the 3C(pro) cysteine protease of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), 52 and the enterovirus 71 (EV71) 3C protease 53 cleave TRIF and disrupt the TLR3 signalling. Additionally, the replication and transcription activator that is necessary and sufficient for the switch from latent to lytic infection with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, mediates the degradation of TRIF through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. 54 Little is known about how viruses may regulate the activity of the endogenous negative regulator TRIM38. As discussed above, the expression of this E3 ligase is up-regulated after TLR3 stimulation. TRIM38 promotes K48linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NAP1 and TRIF and negatively regulates TLR3-mediated type I IFN signalling. 35 The picornavirus enterovirus 71 induces TRIM38 degradation, 55 suggesting that reduced expression of TRIM38 may be beneficial for the virus by targeting molecules yet to be discovered. The precise role of TRIM38 suppression in picornavirus infection remains unknown. In contrast, TRIM38 expression was induced upon vesicular stomatitis virus infection, an ssRNA virus recognized by RIG-I. Over-expression of TRIM38 decreased IFN-b production and increased vesicular stomatitis virus replication in the presence or absence of polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], suggesting that virus-induced TRIM38 negatively regulates antiviral immune responses. 35 Some viral proteins have the ability to interfere with the antiviral pathways by sequestration of cellular proteins such as TRAF3 and TRAF6 that play key roles in the antiviral response. For instance, the M protein of the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus prevents the formation of the TRAF3-TANK-TBK1/IKKe complex and thereby inhibits TBK1/IKKe-dependent activation of IRF3/IRF7 transcription factors. 56 Vaccinia virus inhibits TLR3-induced NF-jB activation by sequestering TRAF6 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-like 2 through interaction with the poxvirus protein A52R. 57 Taken together, these findings provide evidence of the complex regulatory networks that viruses exploit to counteract the TLR3 signalling pathway. The question that arises is how crucial is TLR3 in antiviral immunity in vivo.

The CNS is separated from the rest of the body by the bloodbrain barrier; the cerebrospinal fluid is also separated from the periphery by the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the choroid-plexus epithelium. 75 This structure makes the brain an immune-privileged tissue where, during viral infection, the tight balance between a controlled antiviral response and excessive immune activation determines the pathological outcome. 75 West Nile virus infection induces encephalitis in humans and mice. 76 The role of TLR3 in WNV encephalitis remains controversial, and both protective and pathogenic roles have been reported in the mouse model. Perhaps these conflicting data reflect the use of different routes of virus inoculation and strains. For instance, TLR3 deficiency protected mice that were infected intraperitoneally from WNV lethal infection, reduced blood-brain barrier permeability, and decreased systemic TNF-a and IL-6 production suggesting a detrimental role of TLR3. 77 In contrast, increased mortality was observed in TLR3-deficient mice in association with elevated virus burden in neurons in the brain, suggesting that TLR3 has a protective role against WNV in the CNS. 78 However, the same group found that serum IFN-a levels, viral load in non-neural tissues, and mortality rates did not differ significantly between MDA5-deficient mice and wild-type mice. In contrast, serum IFN production was abrogated and the viral load in non-neural tissues and mortality rates were both markedly higher in TRIF-deficient and TLR3-deficient mice than in wild-type mice. These results suggest that multiple pathways are involved in the antiviral response in mice and that the TLR3-TRIF-mediated signalling pathway plays an essential role in the antiviral response against poliovirus infection in the mouse model. 79 The role of TLR3-mediated signalling in the protection and pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease is intriguing and warrants further investigation. In this case, activation of TLR3 signal transduction before TMEV infection leads to pathogenesis via over-activation of the pathogenic immune response. In contrast, TLR3-mediated signalling during viral infection protects against TMEV demyelinating disease by reducing the viral load and modulating immune responses. 80 Herpes simplex virus 1 is a major cause of encephalitis, whereas HSV-2 can give rise to meningitis as well as encephalitis, sacral radiculitis and myelitis in humans. 81 The role of TLR3 in herpes simplex encephalitis has been recently studied in the mouse model using the HSV-2 strain. 82 Interestingly, TLR3-deficient mice were hypersusceptible to HSV-2 infection in the CNS after vaginal inoculation. Although TLR3-deficient mice did not exhibit a global defect in innate immune responses to HSV, astrocytes were defective in HSV-induced type I IFN production. Overall, these data suggest that TLR3 acts in astrocytes to sense HSV-2 infection immediately after entry into the CNS, possibly preventing HSV from spreading beyond the neurons mediating entry into the CNS. 82 Although HSV-1 strain has been studied in TLR3-deficient mice, 83 the role of TLR3 in HSV-1 infection of the CNS has not been fully investigated. However, the study above has revealed a key function of TLR3 in CD8 T-cell priming to HSV-1. 83 Finally, the role of TLR3 in reovirusinduced neuropathogenesis has been addressed using the T3 reovirus strain Dearing (T3D). 84 No differences were observed in CNS injury, viral loads, and mortality in TLR3-deficient compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that at least for the T3D strain, TLR3 does not play a significant biological role in reovirus neuropathogenesis. 84 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 588, "end": 590, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 808, "end": 810, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 878, "end": 880, "text": "76", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1363, "text": "77", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1569, "text": "78", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2199, "end": 2201, "text": "79", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2679, "end": 2681, "text": "80", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2849, "end": 2851, "text": "81", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 2969, "end": 2971, "text": "82", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 3454, "end": 3456, "text": "82", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 3520, "end": 3522, "text": "83", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 3696, "end": 3698, "text": "83", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 3825, "end": 3827, "text": "84", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 4072, "end": 4074, "text": "84", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral infections of the CNS"}, {"text": "The contribution of TLR3 in respiratory viral infections has been tested for rhinovirus, influenza A virus, vaccinia, and respiratory syncitial virus in the mouse.

By using TLR3-deficient mice, Wang and colleagues showed that lack of TLR3 was beneficial for the infected mice. TLR3-deficient mice showed reduced lung inflammatory responses and reduced airway responsiveness, suggesting that in the context of rhinovirus infection, binding of viral dsRNA to TLR3 initiates proinflammatory signalling pathways leading to airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness. 85 Similarly, in the absence of TLR3, IAV-infected mice had increased survival rates even though the viral burden in lungs was elevated, and it correlated with significantly reduced proinflammatory mediators as well as a lower number of CD8 + T lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar airspace, suggesting a detrimental pro-inflammatory role of TLR3 in the lungs of IAV-infected mice. 86 Furthermore, respiratory syncytial virus preferentially infects airway epithelial cells, causing upper respiratory infections, asthma exacerbations and pneumonia. Respiratory syncytial virus induces TLR3 up-regulation, leading to a priming of lung epithelial cells for subsequent exposure to extracellular dsRNA. Upon TLR3 stimulation, activation of NF-jB and increased levels of IL-8 amplify epithelial cell responsiveness, resulting in an altered inflammatory response. 87 Additionally, Aeffner and colleagues reported that dsRNA induces similar pulmonary dysfunctions to respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice. Respiratory syncytial virus induces nucleotide/P2Y purinergic receptormediated impairment of alveolar fluid clearance, which results in the formation of lung oedema. 88 The role of TLR3 in the pathogenesis of vaccinia virus, a prototype poxvirus, has been investigated using a recombinant strain Western Reserve vaccinia virus that expresses firefly luciferase in the mouse.

Nevertheless, mice lacking TLR3 expression developed higher viral load in the liver and increased mortality compared with their controls after intraperitoneal infections with EMCV 90 and coxsackievirus B4 94 and intravenous infection with poliovirus. 79 In contrast, TLR3-deficient mice demonstrate increased resistance to lethal infection and have reduced liver disease associated with hepatotropic Punta Toro virus infection. 96 Although infectious challenge produced comparable liver and serum viral loads, mice lacking TLR3 were able to clear systemic virus at a slightly faster rate, and exhibited fewer inflammatory mediators. In particular, TLR3-deficient mice had lower levels of IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IFN-c, and RAN-TES than wild-type animals. Therefore, the TLR3-mediated response to Punta Toro virus infection is detrimental to disease outcome. Although IL-6 is critical to establish antiviral defence in this model, it also contributes to pathogenesis when released in excess through a TLR3-mediated mechanism. 96 In addition, non-specific activation of innate immunity can drastically enhance susceptibility to immune destruction of the liver through activation of TLR3. 97 Immune destruction of the liver requires first the priming of liver-specific T cells. These activated T cells then have to migrate into the target organ, where autoimmunity finally occurs. Usually, the liver does not attract liver-specific T cells because chemokines are expressed at low levels in the liver. However, pro-inflammatory signals derived from ligation of TLR3 can lead to homing of CD8 + T cells to the liver with subsequent enhancement of liver disease by a mechanism mediated by IFN-a-and TNF-a-dependent up-regulation of genes and their products, such as the chemokine CXCL9, involved in T-cell homing and migration. 97 This pathogenic mechanism may explain observations suggesting that autoimmunity, including hepatitis, can be promoted by viral infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 505, "end": 507, "text": "94", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 551, "end": 553, "text": "79", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 728, "end": 730, "text": "96", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1345, "text": "96", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1504, "end": 1506, "text": "97", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 2140, "end": 2142, "text": "97", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral infections of the liver"}, {"text": "Overall, data from the mouse model suggest that the protective versus pathogenic contribution of TLR3 in viral infections is multifactorial.

vitro and in vivo have been reported for some viruses. For example, type I IFN production in response to poliovirus infection is mediated by MDA5 in primary cultured kidney cells in vitro.79 Role of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in the pathogenesis of viral infections in humans and mice shown by organ type. TLR3 may exhibit protective (+) or detrimental roles (\u00c0) in humans (a) and mice (b) depending on virus type. (a) A protective role of TLR3 in the central nervous system (CNS) has been suggested for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and influenza A virus (IAV) -induced encephalitis in humans. In contrast, TLR3 sensing of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) may contribute to neuropathogenesis in some infected individuals. Although the precise role of TLR3 in influenza infection in the lung remains unknown, children with a TLR3 polymorphism had an increased risk of pneumonia induced by the pandemic IAV/H1N1/2009 strain. Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children worldwide. Up-regulation of TLR3 expression during infancy might contribute to age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. HIV-1 induces AIDS and it can also cause several neurological disorders. Despite various studies demonstrating an antiviral role of the TLR3 pathway in cell culture, there is little evidence that TLR3 could play a major role in host defence in HIV-1-infected individuals. TLR3 expression is up-regulated in proximity to infiltrating mononuclear cells in biopsy specimens from patients with HIV-1 myopathies. The role of TLR3 in liver diseases induced by human hepatitis C (HCV) and B (HBV) viruses remains to be elucidated. Chronic over-stimulation of the TLR3 pathway may contribute to an unbalanced intrahepatic inflammatory response that is observed in chronic viral hepatitis. Some TLR3 polymorphisms have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in patients infected with HBV. (b) The role of TLR3 in the pathogenesis of various viral infections has been studied in TLR3-deficient mice. TLR3 plays a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus type 1B (RV1B), vaccinia virus (VACV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and IAV in the lung. In contrast, TLR3 plays a protective role against the infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in the CNS. However, the contribution of TLR3 to West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis remains controversial. In the liver, TLR3-deficient mice exhibit increased resistance to Punta Toro virus fatal infection, suggesting a detrimental role in phlebovirus pathogenesis. However, TLR3 mediates protection against poliovirus, coxsackievirus B (CVB3 and CVB4), and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infections in the liver, heart and pancreas of infected mice.\u00aa 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Immunology, 140, 153-167", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) participates in both defence and offence in host immunity to viruses.
