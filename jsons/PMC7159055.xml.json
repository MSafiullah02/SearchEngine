The Chinese government had adopted a series of administrative measures to stop the spread of the epidemic [4], including promulgating decrees that required the domestic internet hospitals to vigorously carry out remote medical services in response to the epidemic [5]. Under such circumstances, the internet hospitals in China, which is a new approach to outpatient health care that provides health services via internet technologies [6], were engaged in the epidemic prevention and control, opening up free COVID-19 consultation services as the main form of remote medical services for the public during the epidemic. This is the first time that internet hospitals have been involved in the response to an infectious public health incident. Its role during the epidemic prevention and control has yet to be explored. This study analyzed the details of the free epidemic consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Through user profiling, we assessed the social panic and the public\u2019s medical needs during the COVID-19 outbreak, revealed the effects of internet hospitals on the epidemic prevention and control, and expounded and explored the managing strategies to make the internet hospitals play a greater role in the infectious public health emergency responses.",

The consultants were certified doctors from the general public hospitals, and the counselees were local residents who were not admitted to the offline hospitals and supposed to have epidemic-related questions. All of the data were extracted from the platform of Zoenet Health Company Limited [7], which cooperates with public hospitals to run the online medical services. A total of 405 invalid consultations containing duplicated or nonmedical contents were removed. Through semantic analysis, 563 repetitive and 3032 unrelated consultations, in which the counselees had no related symptoms and asked questions irrelevant to the epidemic, were also excluded. Each of the remaining consultations were analyzed artificially by one trained researcher and rechecked by another. Any divergence from this procedure was resolved by discussion with all researchers.",

The epidemic-related symptoms were classified into common and uncommon epidemic symptoms. Fever (axillary temperature of 37.5\u00b0C or higher), cough, expectoration, myalgia, and fatigue were classified into common symptoms from which most of the patients with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan in China suffered from as described by Xiao-Wei Xu et al [8]. Symptoms including mild fever (axillary temperature between 37\u00b0C and 37.5\u00b0C), nasal congestion, headache, sore throat, shortness of breath, diarrhea, chills, nausea, and vomiting were recognized as uncommon epidemic symptoms that may potentially be caused by COVID-19 [9-11]. Other symptoms (eg, palpitation, dizziness, unexplained abdominal pain, eye discomfort) were also recorded and categorized as unrelated symptoms. Reattendance means the counselees had once consulted doctors either through online or offline approaches before the current consultation. Epidemiological exposure refers to the history of travel or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas within the Hubei province or other communities with case reports, as well as the history of contact with patients with COVID-19 or contact with people with epidemic-related symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or from communities with case reports. All of the above epidemiological exposure should happen within 14 days before the onset of illness. Hypochondriacal suspicion is whether the counselees had clearly expressed their concern of being potentially infected by the novel coronavirus. Offline visit recommendation means whether the online doctors had suggested an offline consultation. The counselees who had received offline visit recommendations were considered as being in severe condition. Offline visit motivation means whether the counselees had expressed their attempts to go to the offline clinics.",

A recent large epidemiological study found that physical symptoms (eg, myalgia, dizziness, coryza) and poor self-rated health statuses were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression among Chinese individuals [13]. Our results showed that nearly half of the counselees had hypochondriacal suspicion; besides epidemiological exposure, both epidemic-related and unrelated symptoms can exacerbate hypochondria, which can encourage counselees\u2019 unnecessary motivation for an offline visit. This is why a considerable proportion of counselees were motivated for an offline visit without the doctor\u2019s recommendation. On the contrary, most of the counselees in severe conditions were reluctant to go to an offline clinic for fear of cross-infection. The counselees\u2019 motivation was significantly different from the doctors\u2019 recommendation, leading to improper health-seeking behaviors, bringing further harm to the public health.",

Through internet connections, interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaborations can be accomplished to improve the capability of dealing with emerging diseases. The Chinese government had encouraged internet hospitals to join the epidemic prevention and control efforts at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak [5] and confirmed their role as one important part of the joint epidemic prevention and control system [16]. On March 15, 2020, the first professional standard, \u201cSpecification for online consultation service for infectious disease epidemic situation,\u201d was published on the national group standard information platform of China [17], requiring that internet hospitals provide 24/7 online services in response to the epidemic, including prehospital services such as initial screening and medical education; intrahospital services such as offline service appointment and offline visit guidance; and posthospital services such as psychological counseling, post services for medical records, report interpretation for reattending patients, and drug delivery services for patients with chronic diseases. These services should cover all potential medical needs of the public during the epidemic. Meanwhile, the internet hospitals were required to establish intact traceable health files for each counselee and share the data with the supervising departments including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health commissions.",

            "text": "Through the above measures, internet hospitals may help prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic with both primary and auxiliary functions. In terms of primary functions, first, internet hospitals may reduce the crowd gatherings in offline hospitals through multiple approaches. Through online education and propaganda [18] as well as psychological interventions, the online medical services not only teach the public essential epidemic-protective skills, but also alleviate the social panic and help release the public\u2019s hypochondriacal suspicions, thus, reducing the unnecessary offline hospital visits and enhancing psychological resilience [19]. This is consistent with our results that there was less offline visit motivation for the reattending counselees. Meanwhile, the various handy services provided by internet hospitals may reduce the patients\u2019 repeated visits. These measures together may effectively reduce people gathering in offline hospitals [20]. Furthermore, internet hospitals run by public hospitals can connect the online services with the offline medical procedures, offering online triage services and guiding the counselees to the corresponding offline departments according to their symptoms [21,22]. This would make the suspected cases walk through isolated channels to the specialized outpatient clinic, thus, reducing people\u2019s contact within hospitals and further reducing the chance of getting infected [8]. Furthermore, this protects our medical staff, who are the major force in confronting the epidemic [23], from a massive offline workload and unnecessary occupational exposure [24,25]. Second, the internet hospitals may play a greater role through the integration of online resources and offline epidemic control efforts. As most of the provinces in China have initiated a level-1 public health response to control COVID-19, a joint prevention and control system with online information and an offline screening network was established [26]. By sharing information, internet hospitals can help recognize individuals with a higher probability of being infected. Combined with the offline screening conducted by the epidemiologic investigation organizations and the community offices, online consultations and follow-ups may reduce the risk of missed screenings. Meanwhile, self-isolation [27,28] was required for all symptomatic counselees and epidemiologically close contacts [29]. By identifying these counselees, the internet hospitals can facilitate offline supervision for potentially undocumented cases and promote social distancing [30].",

Meanwhile, a more standardized consultation service guideline is needed, enacting different response strategies according to different counselee types.

Second, there are other forms of online consultation services, including paid services held by general public hospitals or private companies [34], which need further estimation. Moreover, the follow-up information after the online consultations were unavailable due to privacy reasons. More longitudinal studies are required to evaluate the counselees\u2019 compliance to the online services. Further studies may focus on how to optimize the online services during the epidemic and expand internet hospitals\u2019 beneficial influences on the public [35].
