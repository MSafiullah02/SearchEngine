When ACE1 activity is increased and ACE2 inhibited, intact angiotensin II acts via the angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) or AT2R to exert pro-inflammatory responses and stimulate aldosterone secretion; these effects not only increase blood pressure and potentially cause hypokalaemia, but will also increase vascular permeability locally, increasing the risk of respiratory distress syndrome. By contrast, angiotensin 1\u20137 acts on the Mas receptor pathway, which leads to anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic responses that would be favourable to the recovery of patients with COVID-195. It could be postulated that individuals with more severe COVID-19 have an imbalance in the activation of these pathways, with an increase in the activation of AT1R and AT2R, which could be the case in T2DM, hypertension and insulin-resistant states.",

In the pancreas, binding of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV, which causes SARS) to its receptor, ACE2, damages islets and reduces insulin release6. In one study, patients with SARS who had no history of T2DM and received no steroid treatment were compared with their healthy siblings during a 3-year follow-up period. More than 50% of the patients in the study became diabetic during hospitalization for the SARS-CoV infection. After 3 years of recovery from the viral infection, only 5% of patients remained diabetic6. As the human endocrine pancreas expresses ACE2, the coronavirus might enter islets and cause acute \u03b2-cell dysfunction, leading to acute hyperglycaemia and transient T2DM6. More importantly, evidence in diabetic mice demonstrated that ACE2 activity levels were enhanced in the pancreas7. This finding suggests that patients with T2DM might be particularly vulnerable to a coronavirus infection. Likewise, T2DM induces expression of angiotensin-converting enzymes in other tissues, including lung, liver and heart7, which explains why T2DM can contribute mechanistically to multi-organ failure in SARS-CoV infections.",

Likewise, early treatment with angiotensin II receptor blockers (such as losartan or telmisartan) or, more directly, recombinant ACE2, might be useful to enhance the ACE2 and Mas system in preference to the pathways mediated by angiotensin receptors.

The intriguing link between coronavirus infections and these endocrine and metabolic pathways will have an important effect on the general medical management of severe COVID-19. Glucocorticoids that have been helpful in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome might not be indicated in patients with coronavirus infection. Glucocorticoids not only aggravate metabolic control, but also attenuate angiotensin 1\u20137 and Mas receptor expression9. Hence, they might have a limited role in the management of patients with COVID-19. By contrast, the anti-rheumatic drug hydroxychloroquine, which is now widely used in many centres around the world treating patients with COVID-19, has also attracted interest as a potential therapeutic intervention for patients with T2DM10. At this point, it is unclear whether hydroxychloroquine in addition to anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic drugs will also directly interfere with the coronavirus\u2013ACE2 pathways.",
