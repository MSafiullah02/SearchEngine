GNB and tuberculosis were the most frequent bacterial isolates. Nursing home residence and absence of leukocytosis were independent predictors of viral pneumonia. A small minority (2.7%) of patients did not undergo any microbial investigation during hospitalization. The rate of identifying the infective etiology in the present study was 28.1%, which was relatively low compared with those (28-53%) reported in the existing literature. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The present study was pragmatic in nature; so much so that microbial investigations were ordered for clinical care rather than research purposes. Sputum and blood culture samples were collected in over half of all patients, and NPA viral samples in over 90% of all patients. Serological test for viral and atypical pathogens, however, was carried out in only 14% of all patients. The low availability was explained by its limited usefulness in clinical management. First, NPA viral cultures are superior to serological tests in allowing a more accurate and rapid diagnosis of viral infections. Second, serological tests do not help in the immediate medical treatment, because empirical antibiotics for atypical bacterial pathogens might be started much earlier than the results of test are available. Third, serological tests require paired samples to be collected 10-14 days apart. The acute titers are collected shortly after admission, and the convalescence titers might not be collected because patients have recovered and been discharged. Despite their limitations, serological tests provide important epidemiological data on CAP caused by atypical pathogens (AP). The present study cannot evaluate the importance of AP in older patients hospitalized for CAP, which can be supplemented by the results of another prospective cohort study on adult patients hospitalized for CAP. That study found that M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were the most common (97.8%) AP. The majority of atypical infections involved older patients (63.4%) with multiple medical comorbidities (41.8%). In comparison with bacterial pneumonia, AP infection resulted in lower 30-day mortality (1.1% vs 6.6%, P = 0.04). 12 In the present study, frail older patients with multiple comorbidities and poorer nutritional status, especially those with chronic cardiorespiratory diseases and dementia, were less likely to expectorate for bacteriology. Nursing home residents, with a preponderance of female sex and a higher mean age (results were not shown here), were less likely to produce sputum than their community-living counterparts. The sickest (CURB \u05462) and dehydrated (plasma urea level >7 mmol/L) patients were also less able to produce sputum.

It was not surprising that it ranked third in the list of bacterial isolates. The conventional culture on the L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen medium usually takes 6-8 weeks to yield, so the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection can be easily delayed. We suggest that, in the places where tuberculosis is endemic, molecular tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of respiratory samples should be used to make rapid diagnosis within hours if pulmonary tuberculosis is highly suspected. 14 In-hospital mortality of CAP depends on the interaction among factors of patient, disease and treatment. Our group has shown that in-hospital mortality was related to pneumonia severity and patients' factors (comorbidities and nutritional status). 15 The present study added that it was not related to the results of microbial investigation.

We found that nursing home residence and absence of leukocytosis were independent predictors of viral pneumonia. Respiratory viruses were the most common infective cause of NHAP.

We hypothesize that the over-crowded living environment in nursing homes contributes to viral spreading among frail older people with multiple comorbidities. This is why outbreaks of influenza-like illness, caused by viral but not bacterial infection, are commonly reported in the influenza peak seasons. This theory needs to be proven in future studies. Furthermore, we propose that NPA viral tests should be ordered for every nursing home patient admitted for CAP because of infection control in both hospital and nursing homes. In our hospital, the results of NPA immunofluorescence tests are available within 12 h after collection. Patients are hospitalized for isolation if their NPA viral tests are positive.
