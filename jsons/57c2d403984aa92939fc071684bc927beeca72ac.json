In its 2009 revision of the Pandemic influenza preparedness and response, the WHO retained the use of a six-phase approach, but made some changes to the criteria. Phases 1-3 are characterized by the transmission of an influenza virus among animals and few humans, and correlate with preparedness, including capacity building and response planning activities. Phase 4 is characterized by sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus, while in Phases 5-6 the virus becomes widespread and prevalent among humans. Phases 4-6 clearly signal the need for response, prevention, and control measures. During the post-peak period, pandemic activity drops, but there are still possibilities of recurrent outbreaks, before levels finally return to those seen in seasonal influenza 3 periods.",

These documents have nevertheless played a crucial role in pandemic response efforts and have provided some basic guidance that can be utilized in the outbreak of any infectious disease.

On August 10th, 2010, based on its global assessment, the WHO removed the Phase 6 alert level and announced that the world was moving into the post-pandemic period. 7 While adjusting pandemic alert levels, the WHO proposed that countries stay flexible in tailoring their specific response measures to their local epidemic situations, and warned that Influenza A (H1N1), as highly infectious as it is, would continue to do harm in the infected countries and could potentially spread to more countries. As the virus continued to spread in the southern hemisphere, which was at that time entering winter, the risk of its combination and mutation with other local epidemic influenza viruses increased, and so the international community was still required to closely monitor the situation.",

            "text": "On July 2nd, 2009, a meeting of the world's health ministers was held in Mexico to assess the influenza pandemic and discuss countermeasures and inoculation distribution. At the meeting, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan called for international collaboration and solidarity, while stressing that special attention must be paid to high-risk groups like pregnant women and patients with chronic diseases. The WHO also called on vaccine manufacturers to provide them a certain amount of free vaccines so as to help developing countries better cope with their epidemics. 20 In response to the ongoing global pandemic, the WHO stressed the importance for countries to carry out inoculations and to set forth three goals for their vaccination strategies, i.e. ensuring the normal operation of national healthcare systems, lowering morbidity and mortality, and minimizing possibilities of community-level outbreaks. To ensure continued normal operations of healthcare systems, the WHO recommended medical workers first be vaccinated, then pregnant women, patients aged six months and older with such chronic illnesses like asthma and obesity, healthy people aged 15-49, healthy children, healthy people aged 50-64, and people aged 65 and older-in that exact order. 21 The WHO also urged pharmaceutical manufacturers to produce vaccines at full capacity, to ensure fair distribution among developed and developing countries. Countries such as China, Italy, France, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Australia, and Japan took steps to vaccinate domestic residents, based on their own epidemic situations, healthcare resources, and ability to acquire vaccines. Some of the countries placed orders for more vaccines in order to cope with potential outbreaks. 22, 23 Response strategies varied widely across countries (see a detailed description in the next section) because each was faced with outbreaks and developments with different characteristics, in addition to political, economic, and cultural dissimilarities, especially in their public health systems which varied in both management and operation. While developed countries already had fairly effective response measures in place thanks to their advanced economic and social development as well as robust healthcare systems, some developing countries with poor economic foundations and weak public healthcare had a much harder time dealing with public emergencies. Therefore, they had an even harder time in dealing with Influenza A (H1N1). After the pandemic broke out, countries showed varied responses to the WHO's recommended response strategies and measures; in particular developing countries that had greater reliance on these strategies and measures as well as technical assistance from the WHO, were much more proactive. There is no doubt that the WHO played a crucial role in helping countries worldwide-especially developing ones-in coping with the pandemic, whether it is pandemic monitoring, clinical diagnosis and treatment of the virus, or vaccine development and distribution. However, because this pandemic originated in North American countries, taking into account the political, economic and cultural differences between countries as well as their different response capabilities, the WHO was also faced with new challenges like how to provide tailored guidance to developed and developing countries. The purpose of this guidance was to increase the effectiveness of related strategies and measures, mitigate and contain the spread of the pandemic, and minimize the negative effects of the virus on society and populations. Such targeted guidance was not particularly prevalent in their guidance regarding response strategies and measures as the requirements placed on developed countries were quite low, resulting in an overall devaluation of said proposed strategies and measures. Therefore, when confronting similar public health emergencies in the future, the WHO should present more pertinent strategies and tailored measures which could play greater roles in pandemic preparation and response.",

During post-peak periods, funds were mainly utilized to purchase unified Influenza A vaccines from manufacturers, which were then distributed to the public with no charge. 33 Some developed countries also specifically established foreign assistance funds that provided developing countries both monetary and material assistance in combatting the pandemic. The United States Congress invested heavily in pandemic prevention and control. In 2006, the Congress provided an appropriation of more than seven billion U.S. dollars (USD) for implementing the pandemic preparedness strategy. On April 28th, 2009, the U.S. President received another appropriation of 1.5 billion USD from Congress which was specifically designated for combatting the swine flu. In July of that year, Congress provided 1.85 billion USD to be used as funds for emergency resource deployment and an additional 5.8 billion USD for emergency preparation and response against the influenza pandemic. 34 In September, the Congress went on to make 1444 million USD available to states and hospitals for carrying out vaccination programs. 35 Meanwhile, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided Mexico with five million USD in emergency aid funds, 900,000 sets of personal protective equipment for virus monitoring personnel, and Tamiflu for 400,000 courses of treatment. Additionally, the HHS provided 147 countries with 769 laboratory diagnostic kits, and donated to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) medications for 420,000 courses of treatment in aid of Latin American and Caribbean countries.",

To relieve pressure on medical institutions, on July 23rd, 2009, the British government launched the National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS). 43 The NPFS was a self-help healthcare system which, through a dedicated website and call centers, provided people worried about flu-like symptoms with professional assessment services, including the suggestions on whether they should receive treatment or contact a general practitioner, etc. A person, if assessed as indeed having Influenza A (H1N1) symptoms, would be given an authorization number by the system, which he or she could use to pick up antiviral drugs from one of local distributions centers.

On April 29th, 2009, the Mexican government declared a suspension of all nonessential public affairs and economic activities from May 1st through May 5th. Moreover, the Mexican government also adopted a wide range of measures to strengthen pandemic information communication and sharing, i.e.: reporting pandemic developments via media channels, setting up 800 hotlines, launching influenza prevention websites, giving out leaflets on pandemic information that called for personal hygiene and increased public awareness of the virus. 45 In the United States, the HSS launched a one-stop influenza information website (www.flu.gov), which gathered information from regular media briefings conducted by the HHS and other federal agencies, 46 and provided the public with scientific and effective information services. In collaboration with federal, state, and local partners, the HHS also developed a wide range of community-based intervention guidelines which were being evaluated simultaneously. The CDC and the DHS provided specific recommendations targeted to a wide variety of groups, including the general public, people with certain underlying health conditions, infants, children, parents, 44 John and Moorthy (2010) 2.3 National and Regional Response Strategies and Measures pregnant women, seniors, health care workers, workers in relevant industries, laboratory workers, and homeless people. With these recommendations, people were equipped to take appropriate action in reducing the transmission of the virus, especially in early autumn before vaccines were widely disseminated. The CDC also provided, and updated on a regular basis, scientific guidance on influenza prevention and control to schools, daycares, universities, large and small businesses, and federal agencies. These comprehensive guidelines provided not only advice on how individuals and institutions could protect themselves against the virus and mitigate its spread, but also recommendations for healthcare providers about the appropriate use of anti-viral drugs, especially in treating patients who were at the highest risk of suffering complications from the influenza. 47, 48 In Japan, after the alert level transitioned from an \"overseas pandemic\" phase to the heightened \"early onset of a domestic pandemic\" phase, the local governments of Osaka and Hy\u014dgo Prefectures required the following for areas where infections had occurred: gatherings and collective recreational activities be suspended, entertainment venues be temporarily closed, social service workers be required to wear masks, teaching activities of varying levels at more than one thousand educational institutions be suspended for one week, citizens avoid trips and gatherings, and business activity be reduced for the time being.",

Immediately following the outbreak, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) subordinate to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) began its research on the virus and vaccination development. In July 2009, the NIAID initiated a series of clinical trials on the effectiveness of newly developed vaccines. In September, the FDA approved manufacturing for four vaccination types, which were then made available for distribution among the states. The federal government then identified priority groups for vaccination and formulated an inoculation policy. 51 Starting on October 5th, a national Influenza A (H1N1) voluntary inoculation program begun targeting high-priority groups including pregnant women; people between the ages of 6 months through 24 years of age; people aged 65 years or older with chronic health disorders like asthma, diabetes and heart disease; and healthcare and emergency services personnel. 52 During the two months that followed, vaccine manufacturers provided 10-20 million vaccination doses each week, an amount which reached roughly 250 million by the end of 2009. 53,54 According to statistics, the federal government ordered a total of 229 million doses of the vaccine with the plans of vaccinating 158 million people, and in the end 90 million people were actually inoculated.",

On the one hand, based on their own pandemic situations, their preparation evaluation, and cost-benefit analyses, developed countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and France, adopted policies that focused more on treatment than on control. The United States, for example, in the early days of the pandemic considered Influenza A (H1N1) no bigger a threat than the seasonal influenza, so the government failed to take strict response measures, like quarantine and medical observation, which resulted in a spike in domestic infections. On October 23rd, 2009 the United States declared a national health emergency, sparking questions about the government's response efforts. While some critics questioned whether there indeed existed such an emergency, others argued that a state of emergency should have been declared from the very beginning.

While the United States began vaccinating its citizens in early October 2009 after the FDA approved on September 15th the marketing of Influenza A (H1N1) vaccines produced by CSL, MedImmune, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, and Sanofi Pasteur, Mexico, which had been suffering a severer pandemic situation, was unable to launch a vaccination program until January 2010. Building a powerful global vaccine production infrastructure for influenza pandemics where countries and regions in need could acquire adequate vaccines at affordable prices became one of the hot international topics at this time.",

A highly controversial event also occurred during vaccination distribution: The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene decided to give the small amount of vaccine available in the early phases of the pandemic to big corporations on Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs and Citibank, an act which experts believe only exacerbated public relation issues. Vaccine production and distribution became a controversial focal point during prevention and control of the pandemic as it involved multi-faceted issues such as vaccine patents, mass psychology, and social justice.",

By August 2010, the WHO had published more than 60 guidance documents on public health topics related to the influenza pandemic, including clinical care, medical treatment and management, laboratory and etiological detection, alert and response, surveillance, epidemiology, vaccines, travel, and personal protection.12   In the early days of the Influenza A Pandemic, the WHO's guidance documents were primarily about pandemic preparedness and responses as well as laboratory and hospital management. On May 6th, 2009, the WHO published a guidance document on biorisk management for laboratories handling specimens of Influenza A that were suspected or confirmed to have caused the pandemic, including recommendations of checklists for laboratory managers and staff members as well as minimum operating conditions for special related laboratory operations.13  In addition, the WHO also published the Case management of Influenza A (H1N1) in air transport, 14 the Clean hands protect against infection, 15 and the Clinical management of human infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009, 16 all of which provided valuable technical guidance in the early stages of the pandemic for containing its transmission and treating those infected.With the spread of the virus along with a growing understanding of it, the WHO revised previously published guidance documents such as the Clinical Management of Human Infection with Pandemic (H1N1), and the Laboratory Diagnosis of Influenza A (H1N1). Published on May 21st, 2009, the Clinical Management of Human Infection with Pandemic (H1N1), was formulated based upon updated virus information as well as data relating to seasonal influenza and the highly pathogenic avian influenza because at that time there was little case data available on H1N1. As experts and researchers began to learn more about the virus and evidence mounted for possible treatments,in October 2009, through a panel of experts in public 12 WHO.

Japan donated 100 million Japanese Yen worth of emergency materials to Mexico-the country hit the hardest by the pandemicincluding 190,000 masks, 3000 pairs of goggles, 3000 surgical gowns, 3000 pairs of surgical gloves, and 1370 bottles of disinfectant agents.2.4.1.6 Some Countries Focused on Risk CommunicationStrengthening risk communication has increasingly become an important part of public health emergency management. The United States' routine monitoring system provided a good foundation for risk communication. Its fast multidisciplinary information sharing, multi-level public communication (national and local), and online information management and dissemination, were crucial in coordinating programs and carrying out public health emergency management and response efforts among federal agencies and departments. The HHS continued to develop and strengthen communication as it was an important part of the public health response efforts, 60 this included broad distribution of public service announcements, news reports, and other traditional media, use of social media such as podcasts and blogs, and frequent phone conferences. The HHS issued a series of risk communication guidance documents like Communicating in a Crisis: Risk Communication Guidelines for Public Officials. Working with the DHS, the HHS also developed a National Situation Report, which was published on the DHS' website. That being said, most other countries didn't possess such robust epidemic monitoring and information collection systems, and so governments' timely explanations and communication took the forefront in response efforts. For example, India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare appointed officials to announce latest developments to the public, disseminate public health information such as disease-related risks, personal protection measures and disease prevention guidelines via media and leaflets, and launch round-the-clock hotlines to provide citizens with pandemic guidance and facilitate the reporting of influenza cases.2.4.2 Controversy over WHO Response and NationalPrevention and Control Strategies and Measures 2.4.2.1 Controversies surrounding the appropriateness of the countries' prevention and control strategies",
