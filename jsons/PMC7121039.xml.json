They are generally well tolerated, manageable, and in part prevented or mitigated by prophylactic therapy, but can be severe and sometimes fatal. Their incidence can be observed well over 50 % of recipients after mAbs administration such as, alemtuzumab, gemtuzumab, or rituximab, and at lower frequency with fully human products, such as panitumumab (about 5 %). This kind of reactions is generally non dose-dependent, and can be partially masked/mitigated by premedication.",

However, their expression, together with other relevant AEs, such as TB reactivation, hepatotoxicity, and induction of anti-drug antibodies varied in frequency and severity according to the agent used. In particular, TB cases appeared more frequently with mAb than with fusion proteins of the same drug class. In addition to the raise of anti-drug antibodies, formation of autoantibodies (ANA, anti-dsDNA) was also observed during anti-TNF treatment, which appears unexpected in the presence of the consistent immunosuppressive activity of this therapy. The concomitant reduction of Treg lymphocytes and consequent decrease of endogenous immunosurveillance have been evoked as a potential pathogenetic mechanisms of antibody response. Interestingly, the presence or entity of autoantibodies does not seem to correlate with increased clinical signs of disease, and only a portion of positive patients showed associated syndromes, such as LLS.",

Autoimmune disorders appear also of particular interest, not because of their frequency but for their wide typology, including hematologic disorders (AIHA, ITCP) endocrinopathies (hyper- hypothyroidism, diabetes), MG, GBS, and systemic autoimmune disorders (SLE, RA, and hepatitis). The spectrum of safety was similar in standard and pegylated form of IFN, with a trend to produce a higher incidence of AEs and related discontinuations in the latter, but with no difference in neuropsychiatric events. Notably, their frequency tended to decrease over time.",
