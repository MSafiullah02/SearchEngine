We also found that more than 33% of the HCWs use official government websites as a primary source of information about COVID-19. This indicates the COVID-19 related updates posted online by the official government health authorities had shown to have a positive implication for improving HCWs knowledge levels. Relying on authentic sources is a key factor to believe the transparent information about the emerging COVID-19 infection and is essential for HCWs preparedness and response. However, a finding of considerable concern that most of HCWs (60%) also used social media as a major source of information. Nowadays, a vast diversity of the information available through the internet and this unverified malicious information can spread quickly and can also misguide the HCWs. The health authorities and scientists particularly warned the wide-spreading misinformation of COVID-19 as a serious concern causing xenophobia across the world [4,16-18]. In this regard, HCWs are should practice with careful evaluation of COVID-19 related information and should use scientific and authentic content of information sources.",

This is unfortunate, as the surge of COVID-19 is devastating globally, and a large number of resources are provided by the healthcare authorities to educate HCWs to improve their knowledge about COVID-19 was immense.
