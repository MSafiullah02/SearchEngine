The textbooks go on to explain this necessity as due to a logical form of the argument: if the conclusion follows, it does so because the argument has a contentless form that cannot have an instance with true reasons and an untrue conclusion.

He treats entailment as the converse of deducibility, and then puts restrictions on deducibility that simultaneously restrict the extension of the entailment relation.

Let us suppose that, as a matter of physiological necessity, every human being will eventually die. Then the form cannot have an instance with a true premiss and an untrue conclusion. But it can certainly have an instance with a true premiss, as in the case of our example, where the name 'Socrates' replaces the variable x. And it can have an instance with an untrue conclusion, as when we replace the variable x with the name 'seven': seven is not mortal, because numbers are not living organisms and so are not subject to dying. The conclusion that Socrates is mortal thus seems to follow necessarily from the premiss that Socrates is human, even though the necessity in question is physiological rather than formal or even (I would maintain) semantic. The usual response in the western logical tradition to arguments like that from Socrates' humanity to his mortality is to hold that they have an unexpressed premiss, variously described as 'unstated', 'hidden', 'tacit', 'suppressed' or 'missing'. In the Socrates argument of example (3), an argument analyst would attribute to the argument the unexpressed premiss that every human is mortal. With the addition of this premiss, the argument's conclusion follows purely formally, so the received conception of consequence is vindicated. But of course it is vindicated only because the postulation of an unexpressed premiss presupposes that a conclusion that follows from an argument's premisses must follow purely formally. To use the existence of an unexpressed premiss that every human is mortal as a reason for holding that the conclusion of the Socrates argument follows formally would be to reason in a circle, assuming what is to be proved. Further, it is odd to hold that an argument has a premiss that it does not have. Like the emperor in the fairy tale of Hans Christian Andersen who had no clothes, the Socrates argument does not in fact have as a premiss that every human is mortal. If we look at it carefully, with the eyes of a child uncorrupted by logical indoctrination, we will see that it has just one premiss, that Socrates is human. Further, why would a person omit a premiss of their argument? The usual explanation, going back to Aristotle (Rhetoric I.2.1357a16-21 [Aristotle 1984 ]) and repeated for example by Quine (1972, p. 169) , is that arguers omit a premiss for economy of expression, when the addressees can supply the premiss for themselves, as a matter of common knowledge. Much human linguistic communication is indeed elliptical, relying on context, both linguistic and extra-linguistic, to provide the addressee with what is required to understand what is said or written. But the difficulty with supposing that arguers routinely suppress a premiss that they think belongs to their argument 1 is that we have no awareness of such a supposedly suppressed premiss, even when we are reasoning things out for ourselves (Hitchcock 1985) . Readers can check this phenomenological fact directly by reflecting on inferences they make for themselves, immediately after making them. It will readily be discovered both that the inference is not formally valid and that there is no awareness of having omitted a premiss.",

The necessity with which truth is preserved or transmitted disappears, to be replaced by the universality with which a substitution or interpretation or instantiation produces an argument with a true conclusion when it has true premisses-against a background in which the universe is as it is, with no consideration of ways it might otherwise be. Equivalently, the impossibility of true premisses and an untrue conclusion disappears, to be replaced by the mere factual absence of a counterexample, where a counterexample is either a parallel argument with true premisses and an untrue conclusion or an interpretation on which the premisses are true and the conclusion untrue or an instance of a scheme of the argument that has true premisses and an untrue conclusion. The modal requirement in the truth-transmission conception that the argument can have true premisses and can have an untrue conclusion is replaced by the factual requirement that as a matter of fact at least one substitution or interpretation or instantiation produces an argument with true premisses and at least one produces an argument with an untrue conclusion. Etchemendy (1990) objected to the replacement of modality by universality. He argued that the model-theoretic conception of logical consequence, which is generally accepted by contemporary logicians as the gold standard against which other conceptions are to be measured, is an incorrect precization of the modal conception, one that both under-generates and over-generates consequences, missing consequences that obtain and inventing consequences where there are none. Sher (1996) has replied that, because all the extra-logical constants in an argument's premisses and conclusion are subject to reinterpretation and variation of the domain is possible, the absence of a counter-interpretation is not just a matter of fact, but is a matter of logical necessity.",

Yet the model-theoretic articulation of the truthtransmission conception implies that it does follow, since there is no re-interpretation of the name 'Napoleon' on which the premisses are true and the conclusion untrue (because nobody other than Napoleon ruled France and was exiled to Elba, and Napoleon was in fact short), even though the \"re-interpretation\" of 'Napoleon' as the name of Napoleon produces an argument with true premisses and the re-interpretation of 'Napoleon' as the name of Giscard d'Estaing produces an argument with an untrue conclusion. The model-theoretic articulation of the truth-transmission conception of consequence thus over-generates consequences. Furthermore, the substitutional and schematic articulations fare no better, since no substitution for the word 'Napoleon' will produce an argument with true premisses and an untrue conclusion and no instance of the schema 'person x ruled France; person x was exiled to Elba; so person x was short' has true premisses and an untrue conclusion, even though in each articulation the non-triviality requirement is met. In a previous article (Hitchcock 1998, p. 32) , I raised but did not answer the question how closely the model-theoretic, substitutional and schematic specifications of the truth-transmission conception of consequence fit our intuitive judgments of when a conclusion follows from stated premisses. The Napoleon argument in example (4) makes the answer clear. All three articulations are too loose a fit: they count conclusions as following when intuitively they do not follow. And the articulations are not on solid enough ground to over-rule our intuitive judgments about arguments like the Napoleon argument.",

The premisses are evidently irrelevant to the conclusion in some broader sense that still needs theoretical articulation. It does not seem very illuminating, for example, to say that the premisses are not germane to the conclusion and have no bearing on it (Johnson and Blair 1993, p. 324) or that the truth of the premisses provides no basis for supposing that the conclusion is true, or indeed for supposing that it is false (p. 55).

According to that account, a premiss is irrelevant to a conclusion for which it is offered as support if it cannot ineliminably be put together with other at least potentially accurate information to provide a set of premisses that is sufficient to justify the conclusion (p. 260). But the premisses of the Napoleon argument can be put together ineliminably with the argument's associated material conditional to produce a formally valid argument. And the associated material conditional is not just potentially true; it is actually true and known to be true: a quick check of reputable sources will tell us that the associated material conditional has a true consequent (Napoleon was short), and hence is true. If the account of relevance in (Hitchcock 1992) is to be rescued, we need some account of why this formally valid expanded argument with premisses known to be true is not sufficient to justify its conclusion. On reflection, the problem appears to be that the added premiss (the material conditional associated with the original Napoleon argument) cannot be known to be true independently of knowing that the conclusion is true, so that the argument cannot produce knowledge of the truth of its conclusion. In view of this problem, the account of relevance in (Hitchcock 1992) needs to be modified by requiring for relevance that one can discover that the other potentially accurate information is actually correct without assuming the truth of the argument's conclusion. On the modified account, then, a premiss is relevant to a conclusion for which it is offered as support if and only if there is a set of premisses that (a) when combined with the relevant premiss are sufficient to justify the conclusion, (b) are not jointly sufficient by themselves to justify the conclusion, (c) are at least potentially accurate, and (d) if accurate can be discovered to be accurate without assuming the truth of the conclusion.",

On the surface, the Napoleon argument seems to meet the conditions under which a conclusion follows from given premisses. It has a covering generalization that is not only true, but known to be true: Every ruler of France who was exiled to Elba was short. Further, this covering generalization is non-trivially true: there is at least one ruler of France who was exiled to Elba (namely, Napoleon) and there is at least one person who was not short-for example, Giscard d'Estaing. But the non-trivial truth of this covering generalization does not license those who know of it to draw the conclusion from the premisses. Why not? One salient fact about the argument, already mentioned, is that, if you did not already know that Napoleon was short, the argument would give you no reason to believe that he was. This fact corresponds to the fact that our only basis for knowing that the argument's associated material conditional is true is that we already know that the conclusion is true. A fortiori, the only way to establish the truth of its generalization is to show for each instance where the antecedent is true that in this case the consequent is also true. One way to test this supposition is to consider a hypothetical case, e.g. another ruler of France who was not short, such as Jacques Chirac. If Chirac were exiled to Elba, he would not thereby become short. Nor is there any reason for restricting ex-rulers of France eligible for exile to Elba to those who were short. It seems then that a crucial requirement for a conclusion to follow from given premisses is that it has a covering generalization that is not only non-trivially true, but also can be known to be true independently of knowledge of truth of the conclusion. And it appears that we know that an argument has a true covering generalization independently of knowledge of the truth of the argument's conclusion if and only if we know that the covering generalization holds not just for actual cases that satisfy its antecedent but also for hypothetical cases that might satisfy it.",

And indeed, counterfactually, if Walter Mondale had defeated Ronald Reagan in the 1984 US presidential election, and had then died in office, his running mate Geraldine Ferraro would not have become a man simply by succeeding him in the office of US president. The generalization that all previous US presidents have been men does not hold for all possible previous US presidents, even though it holds for the actual ones. This limitation corresponds, it seems, to the fact that the only way we can determine that every previous president of the United States has been a man is by discovering, directly or indirectly, about each of the previous 2 presidents that he was a man.

The White House, i.e. the residence of the president of the United States, could have been built somewhere else.

Nevertheless, given that at present the White House is in Washington, the generalization that whoever lives in the White House lives in Washington supports counterfactuals. If John McCain lived in the White House, he would live in Washington. If Vladimir Putin lived in the (US) White House, he would live in Washington. And so on. It should be noted in making these counterfactual judgments that the generalization is being taken to hold only for the present, conceived as a short indefinitely bounded stretch of time surrounding the time of its inscription; it could not license for example an inference from the claim that the 50th president of the United States will live in the White House to the conclusion that he or she will live at that time in Washington, DC, since either the location of the president's residence or the boundaries of Washington, DC might have changed between now and then in such a way as to falsify the generalization that whoever lives in the White House lives in Washington, DC. The time-boundedness of the covering generalization of the Obama argument immediately shows that it is not a natural law. Nevertheless, it supports counterfactual instances. Hence, since one could not know that counterfactual instances of a universal generalization were true if one could discover the truth of the generalization only by discovering the truth separately of each of its instances, the covering generalization of the Obama argument is known to be true independently of knowledge of the truth of the conclusion that Obama lives in Washington.",

But there seems to be no theoretical advantage to this approach over the approach of treating non-law-like covering generalizations that support counterfactual instances as licensing inferences, even if the license is temporally constrained. And, practically speaking, it is easier to ask directly whether an argument has a true covering generalization that supports counterfactual instances than to ask whether it can be supplemented with additional correct information in such a way that the expanded argument has a true law-like covering generalization. With this latter approach, for example, one must make sure that the conclusion does not follow from the additional correct information independently of the argument's stated premisses.

It is enough if the universal condition holds counterfactually, of any individual supposed to satisfy its antecedent. Necessarily true universal covering generalizations do hold counterfactually, and as we have seen the necessity of the generalization need not be semantic but might be for example physiological or constitutional. But, as the Obama argument of example (6) shows, some universal covering generalizations hold counterfactually even if they are not nomically necessary. Substitutional and model-theoretic articulations of the consequence relation cannot be modified to express the requirement that a universal condition holds counterfactually. But schematic articulations can. We can revise the schematic articulation of the truth-transmission conception of consequence to read as follows: A conclusion is a consequence of given premisses if and only if the argument is an instance of an argument scheme, which may or may not be purely formal, that has no actual or counterfactual instances with true premisses and an untrue conclusion, even though it has an instance with true premisses and an instance with an untrue conclusion.",

A true nomically contingent covering generalization will license the inference in the stated argument if it supports counterfactual instances. Even singular contingent statements can license inferences, as in the Iraqi soldiers argument of example (9). In particular, there is no need to revert to an unexpressed premiss in order to understand and evaluate the following artificial argument discussed by Freeman (2011a, p. 183):",

Assuming that this statement is true, it will license the inference in the Socrates argument of example (10), provided that the universal generalization to which it is logically equivalent supports counterfactual instances. And in this case it does. If all humans had green skin, Socrates would have green skin. If all humans had blue eyes, Socrates would have blue eyes. And so on.

To bolster this claim, it would be necessary to get independent and unbiased judgments from at least two people as to whether a given universal generalization if true would support counterfactual instances. Such judgments may require real-world knowledge, as in the case of a sphere of gold versus a sphere of uranium. But, despite ongoing disputes about the truth conditions for counterfactual singular conditionals (Lewis 1973; Pearl 2009; Arregui 2009 ), there seems little disagreement about the truth value of counterfactual instances of a true universal generalization in a world otherwise much like ours or with the same invariant causal relationships as ours. For example, the reader should readily agree that Jacques Chirac would not be short if he not only was a former ruler of France but also had been exiled to Elba; that Socrates would have had green skin if all humans had green skin; that a sphere of gold would not have a diameter less than a mile if it had a circumference of four miles; and so on for the other examples in this chapter.",

The disease was eventually eradicated as the result of an aggressive world-wide campaign to stamp it out. 4 Walkerton is a small town in Ontario whose water supply became contaminated in May 2000. Almost half the population became ill, and seven people died. A study put the cost of dealing with the tragedy at $64.5 million. (http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/walkerton/; accessed 2011 03 14).",

This modal conception would imply that a conclusion follows from given premisses if and only if it was and is impossible for the premisses to be true and the conclusion false. The present conception of the consequence relation is similar, with the additional requirement that the impossibility be non-trivial (i.e. not due to the impossibility that the premisses are true and not due to the impossibility that the conclusion is false), the clarification that the impossibility need not be logical or semantic (and indeed can be established by any counterfactual-supporting covering generalization), allowance for the ruling out of true premisses and a false conclusion to hold only for a specious present rather than omni-temporally, the expansion of the property of truth to other kinds of acceptability, and the recognition of modally qualified rebuttable consequences. I propose then, following the ancient tradition, to take the present account of the consequence relation to be also an account of the truth conditions of a singular indicative conditional, in at least one of its senses. In this sense, a singular indicative conditional is definitively acceptable if and only if it has a counterfactual-supporting generalization that is non-trivially acceptable. It is acceptable in some qualified way if and only if it has a counterfactual-supporting generalization that is non-trivially acceptable in the same qualified way.",

But, although Philo thought that the consequent of a conditional with such truth conditions follows from its antecedent, contemporary logicians and philosophers of language generally reject this claim. They take the medieval conception of a consequentia materialis as a consequence that holds unless the premisses are true and the conclusion false (Kneale and Kneale 1962, pp. 274-297) to reflect confusion between the truth of a conditional and the validity of an argument from its antecedent to its consequent. Likewise, they regard as unfortunate the use by Whitehead and Russell in Principia Mathematica (1910-1913) of the phrase 'material implication' for the Philonian truth-functional conditional, since they generally follow Lewis (1912) in regarding the truth-functional conditional as not capturing the sense in standard English of the word 'implies', which signifies the converse of the relation of following. The problem with construing the Philonian conditional as expressing the implication of its consequent by its antecedent, it is generally thought, is the so-called \"paradoxes of material implication\": a falsehood would imply anything and anything would imply a truth.",

I shall consider each of the four views. the circumstance that the argument's reasons are true and its conclusion untrue seems weaker than the circumstance that the conclusion follows from those reasons. Suppose, for example, that someone were to argue: (14) 8 is divisible by 2, so 8 is divisible by 4. This is clearly a bad argument, even though it has a true premiss and a true conclusion. You cannot legitimately infer from the fact that 8 is divisible by 2 that 8 is also divisible by 4, even though as a matter of fact it is true that 8 is divisible by 4. Thus the inference claim in the divisibility argument of example (14) is false. But the associated material conditional is true, because it has a true consequent.",

These conditions suffice to free us from the paradoxes of material implication\u2026 (Bermejo-Luque 2006, p. 79; cf. her 2011a, p. 79) So we are to construe the supposed counterexample as an argument presented in a situation where it is supposed to be true that 8 is divisible by 2, but we have not already determined independently whether 8 is divisible by 4.

To avoid confusion with other senses of the conditional, let us consider the situation in terms of the logically equivalent negajunction 'Not both 79,974 is divisible by 3 and 79,974 is not divisible by 9.' Given that we know that the first of the two conjuncts in this negated conjunction is true, the easiest and most direct way to determine whether the negajunction is true is to check whether the second conjunct is also true. If the second conjunct is also true, then the whole conjunction is true, the associated negajunction is false and the conclusion (on Bermejo-Luque's account) does not follow. If the second conjunct is false, then the whole conjunction is false, the associated negajunction is true and the conclusion (on Bermejo-Luque's account) does follow. The fact that we have not already determined the value of our conclusion does not bar us, when it comes to appraising the argument's associated material conditional, from making such a determination independently of the argument offered in its support. If we have a way of making such an independent determination, and that determination yields the result that the conclusion is true, we will rightly conclude that the associated negajunction is true. Thus, on Bermejo-Luque's account, every act of arguing for a conclusion whose propositional content can be determined to be true independently of the propositional content of its premisses makes a true inference-claim: its conclusion does in fact follow from the premisses offered in its support.

In other words, I think that an act of arguing such as \"79974 is divisible by 3, therefore 79974 is divisible by 9\" is semantically correct, but pragmatically flawed because the reason is irrelevant. To my mind, this kind of irrelevance is pragmatic: we put forward a reason in order to show a target claim to be correct, but the reason does not work for this end. On Grice's account, the only circumstances in which it is appropriate to assert a conditional is where the speaker is ignorant of the truth values of R [the reason-DH] and C [the conclusion-DH], but believes that if R happens to be true, C will as well. (Bermejo-Luque 2011b, pp. 229-230) This restatement helps to defuse the obvious objection to Bermejo-Luque's interpretation of an arguer's inference-claim as the claim that the argument's associated material conditional is correct. On her account, a good act of arguing requires not just that the arguer's inference-claim be true but that the arguer be in a position to assert it. That is, the arguer must have a basis for asserting it other than the denial of the reason or the assertion of the conclusion. Bermejo-Luque herself acknowledges that this basis can include (2011a, p. 65), and indeed will consist in (p. 198), general rules or general facts from which the material conditional follows. Thus in the end her position is not far from that of the present chapter, except that she rests the claim that an argument has a covering generalization on the pragmatics of advancing it rather than on the semantics of inferential particles and phrases. Later in this chapter, in the discussion in Sect. 8.7.3 of Janne Maaike Gerlofs' position, I will return to the question whether justification of a material conditional without using a paradox of material implication requires appeal to some generalization of it. Verheij (2006, p. 186 ) also identifies the inference-claim of an argument with its singular, ungeneralized associated conditional. Verheij takes an argument to express that its premisses collectively support its conclusion, and takes this support relation to be expressed by the conditional sentence 'if <the premisses> , then <the conclusion>'.

So C' should however intuitively reflect some relation between D and C that is not captured by the truth values of D and C alone. (Verheij 2006, p. 187) Let us call Verheij's non-material, non-truth-functional singular conditional an 'inferential conditional', since it expresses the condition that an argument's premisses support its conclusion, i.e. that it is legitimate to infer the conclusion from the premisses. Verheij does not give a complete account of the semantics of the inferential conditional. He tells us that it validates modus ponendo ponens; in other words, an argument from an inferential conditional and its antecedent to the consequent of the inferential conditional is formally valid. He tells us that one cannot derive an inferential conditional on the basis of logic alone (e.g. from a deduction of its consequent from its antecedent), but must always base its derivation on premisses. But he says very little about what premisses would entitle us to infer the truth of an inferential conditional. In fact, he claims that, if the logic of the inferential conditional were expressed in a natural deduction system, it would have the standard elimination rule for conditionals, namely modus ponendo ponens, but would have no introduction rule. The only derivation of an inferential conditional that he recognizes as legitimate is its derivation using modus ponendo ponens from a more complex inferential conditional of which the inferential conditional is the consequent. In particular, the inferential conditional associated with a particular argument follows from what he calls [following Toulmin (1958) ] the argument's warrant, which is a conditional scheme expressed in ordinary language as a rule statement.

She argues (2009, 2011) that in general the argument analyst should supply as the unexpressed \"connecting\" premiss the argument's ungeneralized associated material conditional. 6 In defence of her position, Gerlofs points out that the associated material conditional does do the job of transferring acceptability from the expressed premiss to the conclusion, by means of the valid form of argument modus ponendo ponens. Given this role, she argues, the associated material conditional is what Davies (1979) calls a \"knowledge conditional\", defined as a conditional in which the antecedent contains accepted knowledge and the consequent a conclusion \"deduced\" (i.e. inferred) from this knowledge: in argumentation the antecedent is put forward as already accepted and the connecting premiss (whether expressed or unexpressed) is put forward as a means of transferring acceptability from the non-connecting premiss to the conclusion. Further, material conditionals derived using the paradoxes of material implication cannot be used as a connecting premiss. If the author of an argument defends its connecting premiss by appealing to the truth of its consequent, the reasoning is circular if the premiss is being used to transfer acceptability from its antecedent to its consequent and involves a contradiction if the connecting premiss is a counterfactual conditional being used to transfer unacceptability from its consequent to its antecedent (Gerlofs 2009, p. 107) . Similarly, if the author defends the connecting premiss by appealing to the falsehood of its antecedent, the reasoning is circular if the premiss is being used to transfer unacceptability from its consequent to its antecedent and involves a contradiction if it is being used to transfer acceptability from its antecedent to its consequent.

The resulting generalizations are logically equivalent to the premiss that Gerlofs provides. If the premiss that Gerlofs provides is true, then the covering generalization to which it is logically equivalent cannot have an instance with a false antecedent, since the antecedent of any instance will be in the first argument a material conditional with a true consequent and in the second argument a material conditional with a false antecedent. Thus, each argument would have a true covering generalization that supports counterfactual instances, in the sense that, trivially, every instance of it with a false antecedent is true. that it follows logically from any statement whose addition as a premiss will make the argument formally valid without making a stated premiss redundant. In her (2011), Gerlofs argues that treating the connecting premiss of an argument as this logical minimum has heuristic advantages, in that it enables one to classify critical questions that one can raise about an argument and to determine whether critical questions posed for a given argumentation scheme cover all the points where a particular argument fitting the scheme can be questioned. She points out that the critical reactions to an argument, which correspond to the critical questions belonging to its argument scheme, can concern the acceptability of the argument's premisses, the ground for the logical minimum or the connection between the ground and the logical minimum.",

If so, then, given the pragmatic constraints that Gerlofs imposes on the justification of an unexpressed connecting premiss, her position would turn out to be equivalent to mine: the argument as stated implies that it has a counterfactual-supporting covering generalization that is non-trivially acceptable. Gerlofs herself proposes (2009, pp. 111-117) to evaluate connecting premisses by means of argument schemes, whose expression as a generalized conditional would provide what she calls the \"ground\" for the connecting premiss. Such schemes are in fact generalizations, at some level of abstraction, of the particular argument taken to fit them, and are taken to hold counterfactually and non-trivially, given satisfactory answers to the \"critical questions\" associated with them that pertain to the transfer of acceptability from premiss to conclusion (Hitchcock 2010b) . Thus her position turns out to be equivalent to mine.

The typical strategy for proving a conditional is to assume its antecedent and derive its consequent. One can then discharge the assumption and assert the conditional on the basis of the assumptions other than the antecedent that were used in deriving the consequent from the antecedent. In a situation where we are given an argument from the antecedent to the consequent and are treating the material conditional as the logically minimal gap-filler, the assumptions enabling us to derive the consequent from the antecedent would serve as what the pragma-dialectical approach calls the \"pragmatic optimum\" (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 1992, pp. 63-64) . In general, an argument for some conclusion would transfer acceptability from the stated premisses to the conclusion if and only if the associated singular material conditional follows from acceptable assumptions none of which either are identical to or rely for their support on the conclusion. Thus, the inference claim of any argument is the claim that its associated singular material conditional follows from acceptable assumptions that are epistemically independent of the conclusion. It is clear that a generalization of the associated conditional that supports counterfactuals must be based on more than the truth of the consequent or the falsehood of the antecedent. What is not clear is that any assumptions epistemically independent of the conclusion that are sufficient for it to follow logically from the stated premisses must be at least as strong as some counterfactual-supporting generalization. However, two suggestions of epistemically independent assumptions other than a counterfactual-supporting generalization turn out to entail a counterfactual-supporting covering generalization. Bermejo-Luque suggested (personal correspondence) that a reason for \"if you promised, you have to do it\" (construed as a material conditional, i.e. a negajunction) may be something like the very definition of \"promising\". She also suggested that a reason for \"if the litmus paper turned red, then the liquid in which it was dipped is an acid\" may be something like a chemical explanation. Definitions and chemical explanations, however, although they are not covering generalizations, entail covering generalizations, which support counterfactual instances if the definition or chemical explanation is correct. So reasons of this kind imply that the author of the argument is committed to a covering generalization of its associated negajunction. These two attempts thus failed to find a way of deriving a conclusion from premisses that is epistemically independent of the truth of the conclusion but does not entail a counterfactual-supporting covering generalization. Their failure, however, at best justifies a presumption that the approach of Gerlofs and the similar approach of Bermejo-Luque are de facto equivalent to the position of the present chapter.",

Second, it rejects something as a consequence when a general but not purely formal feature rules out a true implicans and untrue implicatum. An alternative truth-transmission conception holds that a consequence relation obtains when and only when a general feature rules out that the implicans is true while the implicatum is untrue, even though it does not rule out that the implicans is true and does not rule out that the implicatum is untrue. Both conceptions can be given substitutional, model-theoretic or schematic articulations. However, each of these three articulations of the truth-transmission conception has counterexamples where the conclusion of an argument obviously does not follow from its premisses even though the argument satisfies the articulation in question. The remedy is to abandon the substitutional and model-theoretic articulations and to modify the schematic articulation so as to require that it holds in virtue of a counterfactual-supporting covering generalization. This modification introduces an awkward asymmetry into the evaluation of arguments: covering generalizations that hold merely of actual cases have to be treated as unexpressed premisses rather than as principles licensing an inference. The suspicion that the asymmetry indicates something wrong-headed about the whole approach can be countered by noting that people rarely argue for conclusions that follow only in accordance with a covering generalization that if true would not support counterfactual instances; an explanation of their rarity is that to argue in this way is to beg the question at issue.",

Then in particular, by universal instantiation, if people who are identical with the Iraqi soldiers are very poor soldiers, then the Iraqi soldiers are not identical with the Iraqi soldiers. But, by the meaning of identity, the Iraqi soldiers are identical with the Iraqi soldiers. Hence, by double negation and modus tollendo tollens, people who are identical with the Iraqi soldiers are not very poor soldiers. In other words, the Iraqi soldiers are not very poor soldiers.(R to L) Suppose that the Iraqi soldiers are not very poor soldiers. Now suppose, for conditional proof, that for an arbitrarily chosen property F, people who are F are very poor soldiers. Suppose, for reductio, that the Iraqi soldiers are F. Since they are people, they are people who are F, and thus are very poor soldiers, contrary to our original supposition. Hence, by reductio ad absurdum, the Iraqi soldiers are not F. Hence, by conditional proof, if people who are F are very poor soldiers, then the",
