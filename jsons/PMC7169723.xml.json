The 1918 \u201cSpanish influenza\u201d pandemic resulted in an estimated 50\u2013100 million deaths and held major economic consequences (Johnson & Mueller, 2002). Although pandemic influenza outbreaks have only occurred three times in the past century\u2014in 1957, 1968, and 2009\u2014the twin phenomena of urbanization and globalization have resulted in a situation in which the world is more vulnerable than ever before (Alirol, Getaz, Stoll, Chappuis, & Loutan, 2011; Webster & Govorkova, 2006; World Health Organization [WHO], 2005c).",

An effective and early response to a novel influenza virus outbreak could contain an outbreak prior to it escalating into a pandemic. Accordingly, several international efforts have sought to mitigate the risks posed by a future influenza pandemic through preparedness efforts. These include the International Health Regulations (WHO, 2005a), the Global Health Security Agenda, and the WHO preparedness standards (WHO, 2005a, 2005b, 2005c).",

Numerous countries have publicly available national\u2010level plans, although many of these plans were published prior to the most recent 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic and have not been updated since (WHO, 2018c).",

This guidance details five national objective categories for each phase: (i) planning and coordination, (ii) situation monitoring and assessment, (iii) prevention and containment, (iv) health system response, and (v) communications (WHO, 2005c).

However, evaluating capacities beyond this binary checklist is important for providing a more complete account of the robustness of a national\u2010level plan. The WHO Pandemic Influenza Framework notes that the checklist is an essential part of planning, in coordination with partnership contributions from country ministers and partners, including the United States Centers for Disease Control (U.S. CDC), European Centres for Disease Control (ECDC), and the regional WHO offices (WHO, 2018b). In their respective guidance, U.S. CDC, the ECDC, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) all note the centrality of planning to ensure an effective response to an outbreak (European Centres for Disease Control, 2017; Pan American Health Organization, 2018; United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016).",

The WHO checklist, and by extension our tool, requires considering aspects such as legal and policy issues, points of entry, disease surveillance, clinical management. At a minimum, these require extensive knowledge from a diverse suite of fields including law, government, public health, medicine, and the sciences. A methodology that relies on the judgment of individuals assumes sufficient knowledge of these important considerations. Should an individual not possess this knowledge, a national\u2010level plan may be inaccurately assessed. This speaks to the importance of including multiple individuals in the assessment process. Conversely, if too many individuals are involved in the assessment, it may prove difficult to reach the consensus required for the assessment procedure. Ensuring appropriate individuals are assessing plans is of great importance.",

For instance, the WHO guidance does not address areas such as One Health\u2014the intersection of human, environmental, and animal health\u2014that is central to pandemic preparedness. Planning efforts that want to incorporate these approaches must incorporate resources beyond the WHO checklist and our tool.",

For example, business continuity guidance may be detailed in other documents. However, the tool presented is only designed to evaluate national\u2010level influenza plans. This challenge may be overcome by agreeing to include these additional documents in the assessment if they are explicitly mentioned. At a minimum, if this guidance does exist elsewhere, an effort should be made to incorporate it into revised national\u2010level influenza plans.",

        {
            "text": "Throughout our piloting of the tool, there were interpretive differences in assessment methodology. This most often occurred when a plan referenced a capacity or discussed a capacity in detail. For example, when evaluating the required essential medicines list, a discrepancy could arise if a plan referenced the existence of a list versus detailing the list in the plan itself. Differences in interpretation also arose from linguistic barriers. For example, \u201cmapping\u201d used in the context of \u201cmapping of existing public and private healthcare facilities\u201d was not intuitive to non\u2010English speakers. An inherent limitation of the tool is that the assessment will often rely on the scorer's interpretation of phrases and wording. To help overcome this, scorers should agree on an approach prior to evaluating plans and provide a brief justification of their scores to facilitate the discussion required to reach a consensus score.",

However, health policy does not reflect this. Should an influenza pandemic occur tomorrow, the world's response would be dated and lack key considerations. The updated WHO guidance provides a policy window to address these gaps by developing or revising national\u2010level guidance to improve preparedness for pandemic influenza. Our tool provides one method for quantitatively assessing existing plans to identify which areas need to be revisited in order to comply with the most current WHO guidance.",
