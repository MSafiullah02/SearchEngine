Due to low-paid workers and inherent noise, the quality of acquired data could be easily degraded. To solve this, most previous studies have sought to infer the true answer from noisy labels in discrete multiple-choice tasks that ask workers to select one of several answer candidates. However, recent crowdsourcing tasks have become more complicated and usually consist of real-valued vectors. In this paper, we propose a novel inference algorithm for vector regression tasks which ask workers to provide accurate vectors such as image object localization and human posture estimation. Our algorithm can estimate the true answer of each task and a reliability of each worker by updating two types of messages iteratively. We also prove its performance bound which depends on the number of queries per task and the average quality of workers. Under a certain condition, we prove that its average performance becomes close to an oracle estimator which knows the reliability of every worker. Through extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets, we verify that our algorithm are superior to other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

One simple way to solve this problem is to aggregate multiple responses for each task from different workers. Such aggregation can helps us elicit the wisdom of crowds instead of relying on a single low-paid worker [12] . Over the years, several papers have proposed aggregation methods and verified theoretical bounds for binary-choice tasks [1, 3, 9] and discrete multiplechoice tasks [2, 7, 19] . However, most of recent crowdsourcing tasks ask workers to solve a problem with vectors. Actually, in web-based crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower, a considerable number of requesters ask workers to solve vector regression tasks. (ex Monthly statistics for June 2019, about 22%) As described in Fig. 1 , the examples of vector regression tasks are as follow: (1) Rating movies or items, (2) Finding the location of an object in an image, and (3) Estimating a human posture in an image.",

            "text": "In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm for inferring true answers from noisy responses in vector regression tasks. As in many previous works [3, 13, 18, 19] , we also consider the \"reliability\" of a worker represented by a parameter indicating the worker's expertise level and ability. Our algorithm computes two types of messages alternately. First, the worker message estimates the reliability of each worker, and the task message computes the weighted averages of their responses using those reliabilities as weights. These processes contribute to infer more accurate answers by sorting the order of responses by importance. Then we prove the error bound of our algorithm's average performance based on a probabilistic crowd model. This result shows our algorithm achieves better performance than other existing algorithms with a small number of queries and comparatively low average quality of the crowd. Furthermore, we provide that under a certain condition, the 2 error performance of ours is close to that of an oracle estimator which knows the reliability of every worker. Through extensive experiments, we empirically verify that our algorithm outperforms other existing algorithms for both real world datasets crowd-sourced from CrowdFlower, and synthetic datasets (Table 1) . Related Work. For aggregation methods, majority voting is a widely used for its simplicity and intuitiveness. [6] shows majority voting can effectively reduce the error in the attribute-based setting. However, it regards every worker as equally reliable and gives an identical weight to all responses. Therefore, the performance of majority voting suffers even with a small number of erroneous responses [14] . To overcome this limitation, there have been several approaches for improving the inference performance from unreliable responses. [2, 18, 19] adopt Expectation and Maximization (EM) to evaluate the implicit characteristics of tasks and workers. Also, [20] improves this EM approach using a spectral method with performance guarantees. However, in practice, there is a difficulty in parameter estimation since these EM approaches are aimed at estimating a huge confusion matrix from relatively few responses. [3, 9] proposed Belief Propagation (BP)-based iterative algorithms and proved that their error performances are bounded by worker quality and the number of queries in binary-choice tasks. Furthermore, there are several researches for crowdsourcing systems with multiple-choice tasks. [4] focused on multi-class labeling using a spectral method with low rank approximation, [22] proposed an aggregating method with minimax conditional entropy and [17] suggested an aggregation method using a decoding algorithm of coding theory. In addition, [7] exploits a inner product method (IP) for evaluating similarity measures between an answer from a worker and the group consensus.",

The former suggests a simple serial task assignment method for a qualitycontrolled crowdsourcing system with no theoretical guarantee. The latter proposes a probabilistic graphical model for image object localization and inference method with expectation propagation. However, the worker model assumption in these papers has two limitations; it strictly divides the workers' expertise level and ignores the order of selection when a crowd divides a length into multiple segments. Also, the latter graphical model has too many parameters to learn from relatively small number of responses.",

Results are listed in Table 2 with two evaluation metric Euclidean distance( 2 ) and Intersection over Union(IoU). Our algorithm significantly outperforms others and, even with small number of iterations, can reduce errors rapidly. Empirically, our algorithm converges in less than 20 iterations as plotted in Fig. 6 . Varying Degree on MSCOCO Dataset. Here we show how the performances of different algorithms vary with task degree l. We made a number of task-worker bipartite graphs by randomly dropping some edges to make degree l for each task. As expected, the average error of each algorithm decreases as the task degree l increases. Even when the degree value falls until 5, ours can still keep the large gap among other algorithms. In other words, our algorithm needs less budget to get same error rate. The results are listed in Fig. 5 . Robustness. Since it is well known that message-passing algorithms suffers from the initialization issue in general, we tested robustness of our algorithm by initializing workers' weights to be sampled from proper distributions with moderate hyperparameters. Here we used Beta distribution with (\u03b1, \u03b2), and Gaussian distribution with (\u03bc, \u03c3 2 ) sampled from uniform distribution U. The result is shown by error bar plots in Fig. 6 which represents the deviation reduces rapidly. This result shows that our algorithm is robust to the initialization of workers' weights. When the number of edges are not sufficient to estimate worker message, our algorithm can diverge as iteration progresses since worker message is computed by the reciprocal of the summation between the response and the task message. It can be resolved by adding a very small positive constant on the summation before computing the reciprocal.",
