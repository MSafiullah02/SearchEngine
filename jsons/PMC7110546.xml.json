Most of the haemocytes without any treatment were in amoeboid shape with sporadic bacteria congregated or clumped in their vicinity, as shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2\nA. However, most of the haemocytes incubated with LPS became round instead of amoeboid, with a lot of bacteria aggregated around the haemocytes (Figs. 1B and Fig. 2B). The phenomenon was the same as those haemocytes treated with SNP, a donor of NO, which suggested the production of NO stimulated by addition of LPS (Figs. 1D and Fig. 2D). This process could be effectively blocked by the addition of NOS inhibitor l-NMMA, which showed similar results with the haemocytes not treated with LPS (Fig. 1C, Fig. 2C). These results suggested the existence of NOS in haemocytes of shrimps, and the enzyme activity could be stimulated by the addition of LPS, and blocked by l-NMMA.",

            "text": "In vertebrates, three isoforms of NOS, which can be divided into two functional classes, have been found so far. The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) belong to the constitutive class. They produce NO in short bursts in low concentrations for physiological purposes. The other class, which is mainly composed of Ca2+-independent inducible NOS (iNOS), is related to the diseases resistance of the organisms. iNOS found in innate immune cells and non-immune cells, such as macrophages and epithelial cells, can produce NO in high concentrations for as long as the enzyme is activated. The NO produced has anti-microbial actions against various intruding microbes, mediated by oxygen radicals, and active oxygen species through the formation of reactive nitrogen oxides like peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), via a variety of mechanisms. However, in invertebrates, only Ca2+/calmodulin dependent form was found so far [28], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. And in crustaceans, NOS was reported mainly in the nervous system, regulating neuronal activity [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49]. Recently, Kim [28] reported that NOS could also be expressed in the Y-organ, gill, testis and ovary of the land crab, which suggested that NO was also involved in other physiological processes except for neuromodulation. It was also suggested by Kim that the localization of NOS in connective tissue and epithelia in Y-organ and gill might function in an immune response to pathogens. The expression of NOS caused by bacterial infection in haemocytes of insects, suggesting the potential role of NOS related to disease resistance, have also been reported previously [15], [50]. Here in our experiment, only a slight increase in NOS activity could be observed in the two species of shrimps shortly after WSSV infection, and then it decreased till the end of the experiment, probably due to the destruction of haemocytes caused by WSSV infection at the late stage of experiment [51]. However, the NOS activity in M. japonicus kept at a high level for a longer time than that of F. chinensis after WSSV infection.More interestingly, there was an apparent increase of LPS-stimulated NOS activity in M. japonicus 48 h after WSSV infection, in contrast to the relatively stable level of LPS-stimulated NOS activity in F.chinensis. Referred to the different sensitivity of the two species to WSSV infection, as indicated in the mortality experiment, the results on NOS activity analysis let us hypothesize that the NOS activity in haemocytes of the shrimps might have a relation to the disease resistance ability of the shrimps to WSSV infection.",

            "text": "Although the importance of NO and iNOS in host defense reactions against bacteria have been extensively studied in vertebrates [11], their roles in resisting virus infections is not very well defined due to the very complicated situation in virus resistance of organisms. From some previous in vitro studies, it has been demonstrated that NO could inhibit the replication of a diverse range of viruses, especially for DNA viruses, such as murine poxvirus and herpes viruses, and some RNA viruses, such as Coxsackievirus[52]. However, for virus like coronavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and murine vaccinia virus, etc., the anti-viral effect of NO remains unclear or uncertain [52]. Besides, the overproduction of NO will affect the host defense through its effects on the balance between the type 1 helper T cell (Th1) and type 2 helper T cell (Th2), and the pathological processes through the oxidative stress it caused. Therefore, its intriguing to understand the role of NO in resistance of virus infection. For iNOS activity, it has been reported that it could be induced by many different virus in vertebrates [53], [54], [55], through the direct up-regulation of virus or the indirect effect mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-\u03b3. However, the inhibition of iNOS activity and NO production was also reported recently. It\u2019s hard to make a straightforward remark for the role of NO and iNOS in virus resistance among different organisms to the infection caused by a variety of virus. And the situation is even worse for invertebrates, although there are some reports about the invertebrate NO synthesis [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], none of them gave information either on NOS or NO in virus resistance. In our present study, we found that NOS activity in the haemocytes of the two species of shrimp\u2019s response differently to WSSV infection, which is in correspondence with the different sensitivity of the two species. WSSV, reported as a large dsDNA virus belonging to the virus family Nimaviridae, genus Whispovirus\n[65], might be a target of NO. And the observed increase of NOS activity and LPS-induced activity in M. japonicus shortly after WSSV infection might play a role in resistance to virus infection, which lead to a relatively longer surviving time of the species after WSSV infection. However, all these hypotheses need to be further studied to elucidate the role of NO and NOS in host defense and pathological process in WSSV infected shrimps.",

In the present study, the addition of LPS could also induce the NOS activity in haemocytes of shrimps, and the LPS-stimulated NOS activity in M. japonicus was much higher than that without LPS stimulation after WSSV infection. However, it still needs to be further examined that the induction of NOS activity is good or bad for the mitigation of WSSV infection. The only thing we observed was that M. japonicacus, with higher LPS-stimulated NOS activity after WSSV infection, could survive longer than F. chinensis. If the mitigation effect of increased NOS activity on WSSV infection could be confirmed, it would be helpful for the development of proper immunostimulants, and for the understanding of the mechanisms of certain immunostimulants in host defense ability against the virus infection.",

The comparison of NOS activity in the two species of shrimps after WSSV infection shows that M. japonicus, with higher LPS\u2013stimulated NOS activity after WSSV infection, could survive longer than F. chinensis. The results suggest that NOS in haemocytes of shrimps might be involved in the non-specific defense of shrimps to WSSV infection. However, further experiments are still needed to confirm the expression of NOS in haemocytes of shrimps, and to elucidate the role of NOS in resisting the infection of WSSV virus.",
