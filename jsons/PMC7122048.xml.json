            "text": "The linkages between human health and ecosystems are complex, dynamic, and political. For millennia ecosystems have provided humans with essential services such as food, water, shelter and medicine. At the same time, they have mediated the transmission of many diseases and posed a number of health risks. The vitality of ecosystem services for human health and well-being is well captured by Bernard Abraham, President of Weskit-Chi Aboriginal Trappers Association, when he commented on the importance of forest ecosystems to Aboriginal people. He observed that many Aboriginal people consider the forest as: \u201ctheir food bank, drugstore, meat market, bakery, fruit and vegetable stand, building material centre, beverage supply, and the habitat for all of the creator\u2019s creatures.\u201d1 Many Indigenous people across the world consider the health of the \u201ccountry\u201d to be intricately linked to human health and community health and well-being. This sentiment is not only true for Indigenous people, but for society as a whole. In addition, the intricate links between ecosystems and human health is expressed through aspects of the Indigenous culture, including views and notions of holistic health and well-being, and ecosystem-based cultural rites, and overall close proximity to nature. The World Health Organization captures this notion of holistic well-being when it defines health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization 1948). However, it is the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion that makes explicit the connection between human health and ecosystem health through its identification of \u201cstable ecosystems\u201d and the \u201csustainable use of natural resources\u201d as essential components for health improvement (WHO 1986).",

The report indicates that, over the past half century, human activities have altered the natural ecosystem more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable time in history. This increased pressure has resulted in close to 60 per cent of the world\u2019s ecosystem services being degraded or used unsustainably (ibid). This trend will likely continue to the extent that human beings continue to depend on ecosystems for both the necessities of life such as food and water, as well as the luxuries of diamond and caviar. What is required is recognition of the conjoint nature of society and ecosystems and how each cannot be managed separately. Human beings are integral to ecosystems, and for sometime now, the environmental sector has made use of integrated approaches to ecosystem management that have tried to balance community, economic, and environmental needs. However, the question that still exists is to what extent are these balanced? In addition, what has eluded many concerned with understanding and responding to the underlying causes of human-induced ecosystem degradation is their political and illusive nature. How we apportion blame to the causal factors responsible for ecosystem degradation, and poor health, must be subjected to rigourous analytical interpretations.",

            "text": "The factors that have commonly been identified as responsible for ecosystem degradation focus on rapid population growth, abject poverty and poor land use practices in the global South, and over consumerism in the North. However, as has been demonstrated throughout this book, such factors are the outcome of underlying problems that are not readily apparent, and hence are insufficient to explain the causal basis of environmental problems. The causal basis of ecosystem degradation must be examined from the basis of the structural inequalities surrounding the use of and control of ecosystem services, and how such inequalities drive various land use practices that degrade ecosystems. For example, it is important to examine how states, corporate giants, mining and logging companies, and Northern interests monopolize the environments of weaker actors (e.g. local farmers, peasants, global South), forcing them to till and live on marginal lands. In an attempt to eke out a living, displaced or marginalized communities encroach on fragile and protected lands to \u201cillegally\u201d access natural resources, sometimes making use of \u201cinappropriate\u201d land use practices (Bryant and Bailey 1997; Bryant 1998). Also, in an attempt to increase productivity and maximize the potential of marginal lands, weaker actors may resort to intensive production systems, making use of fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive farming practices which not only adversely impact ecosystems, but consequently human health. In such contexts, then, the identification of \u201cinappropriate land use practices\u201d as one driving factor of ecosystem degradation completely misses the underlying reason for the use of inappropriate land use practices, and any attempt by \u201cexperts\u201d or professionals to develop interventions or policies to correct this will be ineffective and may not prevent/correct ecosystem degradation. The causal basis of human-induced ecosystem degradation is complex and not readily apparent to external scientific experts. It is important that any perceived causal factor be examined from an historical, socio-political, and economic perspective, and examined through the lens of unequal power relations surrounding human-environment relationships. In addition, ecosystem degradation should be linked to broader processes such as unfair trade agreements, global prioritization of environmental problems and the desire for the purest gems, chocolate, coffee and caviars have contributed to destroying vast ecosystems, especially in tropical and developing regions of the world. The unfair trade agreements between the global South and the North, the re-colonization of Africa by China, and the lax environmental regulatory environment in poorer regions have all resulted in a monopoly of Southern ecosystems by multinational companies, resulting in the use of unsustainable methods of resource extraction and ecosystem degradation.",

How do we come to understand ecosystems as \u201cextensively degraded\u201d, or describe other environmental problems as \u201cglobal crisis\u201d? Critical scholars argue that the identification and causal explanation of environmental problems is not value-free nor is it ever politically neutral. They argue that the framings of environmental problems and their causal explanations are shaped by the social and political contexts within which they emerge, and so are never partial, but can be located. Critical environmental scholars caution against accepting scientific environmental knowledge claims as \u201cfact\u201d, \u201caccurate\u201d and a true representation of reality, without re-evaluating these claims within the socio-political and historical contexts within which they are framed (Bryant 1998; Forsyth 2003; Peet and Watts 1996).",

We also fail to capture the micro-politics and power struggles surrounding access to, and use of natural resources at varying scales, and how such struggles shape people\u2019s interactions and experiences with the biophysical environment. Also, given that most scientific environmental knowledge serves as the basis for policy formulation, there are concerns that environmental policies and interventions that are based on \u201cunreconstructed\u201d scientific knowledge could fail to uncover the \u201creal\u201d causes of ecosystem degradation and end up proposing wrong interventions that could further augment existing inequities surrounding the use and control of those resources (Forsyth 2003). For example, in many parts of Africa, some natural resource management policies are still based on colonial policies, without reevaluating these policies within the current challenges and needs of today\u2019s communities.",

Just like critical environmental scholars, critical public health scholars seek to illustrate that the emergence and social patterning of specific public health problems, especially those associated directly and indirectly with the environment, lie in the unequal power relations surrounding the use of, and control of environmental resources and the uneven distribution of the associated costs (e.g. pollution) of environmental activities. The concern here is to broaden the causal basis of the emergence of specific ecosystem-mediated health problems beyond exposure to disease vectors and microbes, to incorporating people-environment power dynamics and how such dynamics result in the exposure of weaker actors to environmental health risks. Explaining health problems from the basis of exposure to microbes and pathogens alone is equivalent to blaming the victim, while relieving important social and political factors that constrain the individual from freely making the decisions to avoid risk in the first place. Similarly, the uneven distribution of the costs of ecological activities and the resulting social patterning of poor health should be examined from the context of how unequal power relations allow powerful actors to displace their environmental costs to weaker actors through such acts as dumping toxic waste in other communities. These communities also are those with limited coping capabilities and have little resources to mitigate the adverse effects of these environmental pollutants.",

Ecosystem degradation, the causal explanations, and the associated health problems are equally complex and should not be explained simplistically and uni-dimensionally. After all, ecosystems and society are conjoined and the activities within each sphere must be seen as constituted by, and from the other. Such inter-dependencies (political, social, economic, ecological dimensions) must always constitute the core of ecosystem-society-health investigations. The theoretical frameworks used to analyze human-environment interactions from such political, ecological, and social perspective fall outside the purview of pure ecological and health sciences disciplines, instead residing more with transdisciplinary fields such as health geography, environmental sociology, medical anthropology, and other related fields. Similarly critical perspectives have been applied to environmental issues in the form of poststructuralist or critical political ecology and to public health field in the form of critical public health. However, the extent to which the two fields have been brought together to examine issues at the interface of public health and environmental conditions is very limited.",

Most of the ecohealth literature has not engaged with such theoretical perspectives and hence lacks critical theoretical rigour in its analyses of environment and health phenomena. This book draws on critical social theory, including political ecology, feminist theories, and postcolonial and poststructuralist perspectives to examine environment and health issues from a critical perspective. In so doing, a new analytical framework called critical ecohealth is developed through the fusion of two theoretical perspectives: critical political ecology and critical public health. Critical ecohealth locates ecohealth problems, their causal explanations, the proposed interventions within a broader analytical framework, examining how they are framed, and drawing attention to their socio-political, economic, and historical antecedents. Prior to examining these theoretical frameworks in subsequent chapters, it is important to review some of the common associations between human activities, ecosystem change and how this influences human health and well-being.",

            "text": "The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment report (MA 2005) describes an ecosystem as a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and micro-organism communities and the nonliving environment interacting as a functional unit. Ecosystems including, farmlands, water bodies, woodlands, rangelands, and forests, produce services that are essential for human health and well-being. These services are usually classified into four categories: provisioning services, regulating services, cultural services, and supporting services (MA 2005). Provisioning services refer to the benefits derived from ecosystems such as food, freshwater, fibre, shelter, medicine, and fuel. These basic necessities underlie the sustenance of many communities. Many developing country nationals rely on the natural environment for medicinal plants, wildlife and other non-timber forest products. The second category, regulating services, refer to ability of ecosystems to regulate climate, purify freshwater, and regulate pest and diseases. The regulation of ecosystem processes can modify ecosystems in ways that influence the proliferation and transmission of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes or snails. Cultural services are those non-material benefits obtained from ecosystems, and include aesthetic, spiritual, educational, and recreational qualities. Cultural services provide a wide spectrum of benefits, since different cultures associate and interact with the environment in myriad ways. For example, for some, the natural landscape serves as an ideal space for healing, meditation, recreation and the performance of cultural rites. The close bond between many Indigenous communities and other local people, and the biophysical environment endows them with unique knowledge systems about the structure and functioning of these ecosystems. This local knowledge is an essential complement to scientific understanding of the environment. Lastly, supporting services are those that contribute to ecosystem processes such as primary production, soil formation, and nutrient recycling. Compared to other services, the benefits of supporting services are indirect and occur over a longer-time frame.",

Land use activities such as deforestation, clearance of virgin lands for agriculture and human settlement, irrigation, dam construction, road building, mining, wetland modification, and urbanization, have been identified as some of the key modifiers of ecosystems around the world. The modification of various ecosystems has resulted in the emergence and spread of a number of infectious diseases, and modified the transmission of endemic diseases (Patz et al. 2000). For example, the clearance of forests for agricultural purposes can disrupt the structure and functioning of ecosystems and lead to the emergence of infectious diseases. In Central Africa, the outbreak of Ebola, which killed hundreds of people and thousands of apes was linked to human migration into forested ecosystems where people came into contact with new microbes and animal reservoirs (Leroy et al. 2004). In Malaysia, agricultural activities have been linked with the emergence of Nipah virus (Lam and Chua 2002), while increased risk to Lyme disease in the northeastern United States has been associated with forest fragmentation, biodiversity loss, followed by suburban housing development (Schmidt and Ostfeld 2001). Also, with the relative ease of travel and transportation of goods and services around the globe, it does not take long for infectious diseases to spread from one corner of the globe to the other, as seen with the recent case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Swine Flu.",

Not only did the emergence and quick spread of these diseases cause global pandemonium and drain the health budgets of many regions, but also has raised concerns about the state of global public health security and the readiness of public health authorities to respond and contain the spread of these pandemics in a quick and effective manner. Factors such as rural-urban migration, globalization, North-South migration, trade, and the fast pace of travel all contribute to making this task a challenging, yet important one. According to a recent report, not only are infectious diseases spreading faster geographically than any period in history, but they also seem to be emerging at a quicker pace than before (WHO 2007). The report indicates that since 1970, new diseases have been emerging at an unprecedented rate of one or more per year, resulting in about 40 new diseases that were unknown about a generation ago.

This disturbed equilibrium brings humans into contact with new pathogens that can infect humans, livestock or wildlife (Wolfe et al. 2000).

Zoonotic pathogens \u2013 that is, those pathogens that can be transmitted between wild or domesticated animals and humans \u2013 have been identified as the most significant cause of emerging infectious diseases (Taylor et al. 2001). Taylor and colleagues observed that out of 1415 species of infectious organisms that have been identified to be pathogenic to human beings, 61% are zoonotic pathogens. Emerging infectious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Symptoms (SARS), avian influenza, West Nile and HIV/AIDS, Nipah virus, Ebola, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are all associated with zoonotic pathogens. In general, zoonotic diseases are usually severe, with high fatality rates, and have no readily available cure, treatment or vaccine. Because zoonotic pathogens complete part of their natural life cycle in animal hosts, any human-induced activity that disturbs the equilibrium of wildlife habitats, such as encroachment into forested areas, is likely to facilitate the transmission of zoonotic pathogens between humans, wildlife, domestic animals, and plants (Daszak et al. 2001).",

The construction of forest roads, the creation of culverts and other dugouts collect rainwater and serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes (Patz et al. 2004). Also mercury is naturally embedded in the soils of most rainforests. Hence soil erosion that occurs following downpours wash mercury residue into rivers and other water bodies, contaminating water bodies.

These intensive production systems, in association with ecological and other factors, have been linked to the emergence of diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus, and avian influenza (World Health Report 2007). Modern production systems are characterized by activities such as increased livestock trade between regions, especially poultry and wild animals (bushmeat), overcrowding and mixing of livestock breeds, and cohabitation of livestock and people, especially in rural communities (Graham et al. 2008). Such production practices create fertile grounds for interspecies host transfer of disease agents, resulting in the emergence of novel strains of diseases or human pathogens such as SARS and influenza.",

For example, intensive production systems usually require large quantities of livestock feed and increase the pressure on cultivated ecosystems. They also make use of large quantities of fertilizers, pesticides and water to enhance productivity. Intensive farming practices also generate large amounts of waste, which sometimes is not adequately disposed off. Waste is mostly flushed into waterways, which end up polluting freshwater bodies, contaminating public water supplies, and affecting marine plants and animals. In addition, some intensive livestock management practices routinely use sub-therapeutic antibiotics, which have resulted in the occasional emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and E. coli bacteria (Garofalo et al. 2007).",

Nipah virus is an emerging viral pathogen that causes encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. It is fatal in up to 75% of the people it infects (WHO 2007). Between 1998 and 1999, the first outbreak of Nipah virus was reported in the Malaysian Peninsular, where 265 human cases including 105 deaths were reported (FAO/WHO 2002). The emergence of the virus is attributed to the interaction of various factors including expanding human population, climate change, poor governance, illegal land clearing, forest fires and intensive animal husbandry (ibid). The path of contagion is traced back to the human cases coming into direct contact with sick or dying pigs or fresh pig products. These pigs became sick after coming into contact with a flock of bats that were infected with a previously unknown virus. The bats migrated from neigbouring Indonesia, following an intense El Ni\u00f1o dry spell and forest fires in the region. In Malaysia, the bats came into contact with intensively, commercially raised pigs that were located near fruit orchards. The pigs acted as the intermediate hosts of the new virus, and developed respiratory illnesses. It is believed that transmission among pigs occurred through the aerosol route, with transmission from pigs to humans taking place following contact with throat or nasal secretions of pigs by humans. Nipah virus later occurred in Singapore, where it infected 11 human cases resulting in one death. In Malaysia, the outbreak ended with the mass culling of more than 1 million pigs (WHO 2007).",

For example, evidence suggests that, in the most recent outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, the consumption of contaminated food such as fruits contaminated with the urine or saliva of fruit bats could likely constitute the route of exposure for several new human infections. Also human-to-human transmission could occur through close contact with people\u2019s secretions and excretions.

Extreme weather events, such as floods and windstorms may contaminate fresh water supplies, facilitate the dispersal of microbes, and affect the breeding, survival, and abundance of disease vectors. Outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and leptospirosis have followed flooding in Central America (Wilson 2000). Heavy precipitation may pollute water sources with increased quantities of chemical and biological pollutants that are washed into rivers and from overloading sewers and waste storage facilities. Temperature increases may also affect water quality by increasing the growth of microorganisms and decrease dissolved oxygen (McMichael et al. 2006).",

For example, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identified Indigenous groups and coastal communities as two groups that are most vulnerable to climate change. As has been discussed in the chapter on Indigenous health, the close affiliation between most Indigenous people and the natural environment, together with poor socio-economic conditions, predispose them to severe impacts resulting from climate change. Similarly, people living in coastal areas and floodplains are extremely vulnerable to extreme weather events, which can destroy infrastructure and displace entire communities. Temporary relocation of displaced people can lead to increased incidence of communicable diseases due to overcrowding, limited health services, lack of clean water and sanitary facilities, poor mental health and poor nutrition.",

Ecosystems provide services that are essential for life. These services are continuously under pressure given the growing demand for food and other societal needs. In an attempt to increase productivity, human activities transform ecosystems in ways that compromise their ability to continue to provide ecosystem services. They also transform ecosystems in ways that engender disease and adversely impact both ecosystem and human health. The causal pathways between human activities, their driving forces, and how they transform ecosystems to adversely impact health are complex and not amenable to linear processes. In addition to biophysical processes, social, political, economic and cultural factors further confound these interactions. Hence, given the increasing realization that over the next few decades, the most important determinant of human health will be ecological factors, it is probably prudent for researchers to begin to unravel these intricate connections between society, health, and environment, and ensure that power relations, and social and political considerations are incorporated into people-environment-health analysis. Such understanding will help develop appropriate interventions that will be socio-politically acceptable and also biophysically relevant.",

For the past few decades there have been growing efforts to integrate health and environment concerns and to develop more ecological and holistic approaches to public health improvement, and sustainable natural resources management. This trend has given rise to new approaches such as the ecosystem approaches to human health, also known as the Ecohealth approach. Before discussing some of the key elements of this approach, it is important to trace the evolution of events leading to a renewed interest in ecological approaches to health, and in particular, the ecosystem approach to human health (Forget and Lebel 2001).",
