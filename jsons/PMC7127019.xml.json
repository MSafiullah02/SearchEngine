They were better adapted to European conditions during the Ice-Age, having lived there for 200,000 years. Modern humans in contrast, had migrated from subtropical environments in North Eastern Africa, and were better suited for warmer conditions. Neandertals were much more competent in using tools and preparing weapons than previously thought [8]. The more we learn about Neandertals, the harder it is to believe that we simply out-smarted them. The Neandertals were indeed extremely successful hunters and were taking down game ranging from large woolly mammoths, to quick and agile deer. Analysis of mtDNA of populations in Asia supports the view that there was only a single dispersal out of Africa by AMHs, and additionally this population has split early into at least one European and one Asian branch although the evidence is not conclusive for this scenario [9]. It is therefore not very likely, assuming similar reproduction rates that AMHs outnumbered and overwhelmed the Neandertals.",

Recently, Stormer and Mysterud described two different mechanisms by which long term exposure to smoke pollutants in caves and rock shelters might have contributed to Neandertal extinction. Open burning releases large amounts of air pollutants, including dioxins, that can induce short term and long term effects on human health, especially in children [14]. Underdown suggested a contributory role for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) that could have infected Neandertal groups as a result of general cannibalistic activity and brain tissue consumption in particular [15].",

            "text": "The evolutionary origin of several viral pathogens correlates with the genetic and paleontological data of first contact and near first contact of AMHs and Neandertals. We propose that AMHs introduced an infectious agent, deriving from Eastern Africa, into the population of the Neandertals. We would expect Neandertals to be extremely vulnerable to most introduced diseases. First, in Africa, AMHs and their ancestors had gone through intense selection and co-evolution with pathogens in their sub-tropical environment. The survivors who withstood those particular diseases emigrated to Europe. We believe that Neandertals would have encountered fewer human pathogens in their evolutionary history, at least during the past 200,000 years before AMH arrival in Europe. And those infectious diseases that might have been present in Europe at that time, would then have been of a very different nature than those in Africa. Why should have Neandertals experienced fewer plagues and infectious diseases before the arrival of AMHs? The main reason is that most diseases affecting humans are ultimately zoonotic diseases that originated in animals. For a zoonotic pathogen it is normally much easier to breach the species barrier if the species are closely related. Therefore African primates could have served as a reservoir or transmitter of pathogens for developing humans. Examples for this can also be observed in recent history (HIV jumped from primates to humans some 70\u2013100 years ago). Even zoonoses from other species would be facilitated in Africa by the greater species diversity of rodents, bats and insects that serve as reservoirs for many viruses and other pathogens (reviewed in Refs. [16], [17], [18]). This environmental background may have led to a higher genetic resistance against infectious diseases in AMHs compared to Neandertals. The third reason why Neandertals were more vulnerable is they were descended from a very small group and long-term effective population size of Neandertals was smaller than that of modern humans and extant great apes at the time of AMH arrival. Recent studies including mitochondrial DNA analysis propose that it was as low as 10,000 individuals [19]. There is also evidence that the genetic variability of the Neandertals was very low. The mtDNA genetic diversity in Neandertals between 38,000 and 70,000 years ago was estimated to be one-third of that in contemporary modern humans [19] and, more importantly, much lower than that of the AMHs who more recently descended from the largest human gene pool in Africa. Greater diversity of the immune system increases the number of pathogens that can be recognized. Given the overall lack of genetic diversity of Neandertals, they likely lacked immune gene variability as well putting them at a higher risk of developing disease relative to AMHs.",

Such vectors would not have been able to co-migrate with the AMHs from Africa to glacial Europe.(3)The infectious agent was circulating among AMHs during the migration from Africa to Europe, without being eliminated from the population, i.e., persistent or chronic infection developed in AMHs.(4)AMHs adapted to the infectious agent in a way that did not strongly affect the health of the entire population, although some individuals may have developed a lethal infection.(5)The infectious agent could be transmitted by social contact.(6)The pathogen appeared, or at least continued to evolve, in Africa after Neandertal ancestors had left the continent.\n",

Other viruses exclude themselves from the pool of candidates by either not supporting a persistent infection (e.g., rubella virus), by requiring a vector (e.g., West-Nile virus and Yellow fever) or by simply arriving too late (e.g., dengue virus and Influenza A) to be relevant to Neandertals (see Table 1).",

There are several characteristics and properties of viruses that support our hypothesis.(1)Today we know that the majority of emerging viral diseases are transmitted from animals to humans. Many of them have developed in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and crossed the species barrier when humans came in close contact with wild or domesticated animals.(2)There are a number of examples of chronic and recurring viral infections in humans that reach a very high seroprevalence in susceptible populations. Infections caused by retroviruses, herpesviruses, hepadnaviruses and many others are able to develop into persistent infections lasting for years.(3)In immunocompetent humans many viral infections are not lethal, especially if a population has had enough time to adapt or to co-evolve with that pathogen. After a more or less pronounced acute phase after primary infection, symptoms often decline. Examples are HIV infections, hepatitis B and C and Herpes simplex.(4)If a viral infection is introduced into an immunologically na\u00efve population that has not encountered the virus for generations, the outcome may be dramatic. The introduction of measles and small pox into the Americas by Europeans resulted in millions of deaths in Native American populations.(5)Even if many viruses in fact depend on vectors, a large number of viruses can be transmitted by direct human-to-human contact as the viruses are often contained in body fluids and excrement. Smallpox, chickenpox, kissing disease and SARS are examples of viruses which can infect by means of direct human to human transmission.(6)For many viruses, it has been shown that their genetic subtypes are scattered over the entire globe with no strong local or regional pattern. This means that they were already circulating in the human population that left Africa 100,000 years ago.\n",

Another example comes from the Shetland Islands, off the Scottish coast. In the early 1900s the island inhabitants lived in small villages. Each island population was separated from the next island. Even in such isolated communities, several cases of varicella in children followed a single case of shingles in an adult [30]. An efficient mode of transmission in isolated societies depends upon reactivation of the virus as zoster in adults and its subsequent transmission to children as varicella. The group of AMHs that left Africa to (re)-colonize Europe were at least a partially isolated group on their way north.",

In support of our hypothesis, it may be noted that Neandertals did not disappear immediately after the arrival of AMHs in Europe. They coexisted for at least 15,000 years, providing a time for the spread of a virus from an AMH group to a Neandertal group and between different Neandertal groups. Favouring co-existence, the last known localities of Neandertal habitation were in Spain including a cave in Gibraltar. Humans appear in the fossil record 28,000 years ago and subsequently Neandertals disappeared.

If present, short viral sequences of 60\u201380 bp could be easily and unambiguously detected and distinguished from Neandertal DNA. At present, no viruses or other pathogens without a DNA genome would be detected, as RNA does not survive thousands of years in ancient samples. Naturally, to enable detection, the corresponding pathogen, or its DNA, should be present in skeletal samples per se, and not merely represented in the soil or environment. Herpesviruses have a genome of double-stranded DNA and therefore it should be possible to look for specific virus sequences in ancient DNA. The VZV genome consists of approximately 125,000 bp of DNA with more than 70 open reading frames (ORFs) and is arranged in long and short unique segments with terminal repeat regions [21].

However, advances in protein sequencing could potentially allow for the sequencing of short viral peptides that could at least identify the pathogen. However, this has not been tested yet in a fossil context for viruses. Biomolecular methods have been used for the first time to show a correlation between extinction and disease in mammals, although in that study, skin was available for study [33]. This is at least a proof of principle for pathogen detection in ancient samples, permitting empirical correlation of pathogen presence and subsequent extinction.

As a starting point, chromosome 6 could be analyzed. It contains the family of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and harbours the most gene-dense region of the entire human genome. The MHC region on chromosome 6 contains approximately 140 genes and many of these have a known function in the immune system or in autoimmunity. An analysis of the allelic diversity of the MHC class I complex, for example could yield a wealth of information in respect to susceptibility of Neandertals to a variety of diseases. However, to fully understand the degree of allelic diversity of MHC genes one needs the chromosome 6 sequence of a large group of Neandertal individuals with both a geographical and temporal sampling protocol that would allow one to examine MHC diversity over space and time.
