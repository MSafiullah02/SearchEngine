The rationale for administration of prednisolone is based on the consideration that inflammatory tissue alterations are also elicited by tissue ischaemia and hypoxia. In addition, prednisolone mobilizes amino acids for gluconeogenesis, alters glucose utilization and influences protein metabolism. Finally, prednisolone binds with equal affinity to both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors widely distributed in cochlear tissues, thereby contributing to restoration of cellular osmolarity, electrochemical gradients, transmembrane ion flux and neuronal conduction. In patients presenting with contraindications (e. g. diabetes, severe chronic gastritis, gastric or duodenal ulcera) for the treatment with prednisolone, intravenous infusion of a hyperoncotic hydrophilic haemodilutive plasma-expanding agent, such as hydroxyethyl starch or others (250-500 ml/day for 5-10 days) is a good alternative option. Sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss must be managed with care and as soon as possible concerning the diagnostic procedures and the mode and beginning of therapy. According to the categories of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (http://www.cebm.net), the evidence level of most clinical trials on therapy of sudden deafness is relatively low. In addition, the clinical trials considered in the Cochrane International Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, e. g. prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind conducted studies, are of relatively high level of evidence; however, the underlying study protocols vary tremendously. Therefore, universally valid therapeutic options based on reproducible results are not available. Instead, thera peutic recommendations are merely formed empirically. Spontaneous recovery rates range from 31 to 68%; however, these data were revealed from retrospective, non-randomized and mostly non-controlled trials on a few patients only. Furthermore, the term \"recovery\" was not exactly defined, e. g. partial remission was not distinguished from complete remission, and a persistent tinni-However, contraindications (e. g. arterial hypertension) should be noted, and potential side effects (e. g. temporary pruritus) should be considered. In the case of contraindications for haemodilution, another haemorheological active drug such as pentoxifylline (100 mg, equivalent to 5 ml/day dissolved in 100 ml 0.9% isotonic saline) may be intravenously infused for 5-10 days. Additional administration of scavangers of toxic free oxygen radicals such \u03b1-lipoic acid (600 mg/day orally) during haemodilutive or haemorheological infusion therapy may be reasonable to prevent reperfusion injury within the cochlea. Low-frequency and middle-frequency idiopathic \u2022 sensorineural hearing loss. A daily dose of 250-500 mg prednisolone intravenously on three consecutive days is recommended. In the case of partial or no remission, prednisolone treatment should be continued orally for 16 days together with gastric proton pump inhibitors as described above. Additional osmotic infusion therapy using mannitol (15 g in 100 ml solution) and acetazolamide (500 mg) intravenously on three consecutive days may be administered.

Congenital perilymphatic fistulae of the stapes footplate occur in cases of malformation of the stapes and cause recurrent meningitis. They are usually detected during exploration of the oval window. Perilymphatic fistulae of the round window membrane are rare findings in cases of sudden hearing loss. There are no clear clinical symptoms characteristic for round window membrane rupture.

However, in cases where hearing loss is less than 30 dB HL at three or fewer frequencies (2 kHz included), a broadband noise generator (formerly tinnitus masking device) may be helpful to defocus on tinnitus. \u2212 In addition, active listening to music of someone's own choice and/or to audiobooks are reasonable therapeutic auditory training strategies which may be helpful to direct the patient's attention to external auditory stimuli again. 1.6.9 Noise-induced Hearing Loss 1.6.9 Noise-induced Hearing Loss",

Typically, hearing loss initially occurs as a sensorineural high-frequency notch, normally at 4 kHz (c 5 notch). The middle frequencies, e. g. the main speech frequencies, are affected considerably later. The recruitment is always positive. In approximately 70% of cases, a bilateral tonal tinnitus exists. The extent and the progress of the hearing loss depend on the intensity, duration of exposure and frequency composition of the sound as well as the duration of recovery phases and the individual noise susceptibility. An individual noise susceptibility is suspected in genetically predamaged inner ears, after sudden hearing loss, after treatment with ototoxic medication and trauma. Moreover, humans with blond hair, fair complexion and lightly coloured eyes seem to be especially endangered owing to a lack of melanin.",

They may be related to syndromes that are associated with other symptoms or occur in isolated forms. 6. Acquired hearing impairment: hearing loss may be acquired in the perinatal period owing to hypoxaemia, severe infections, prolonged newborn icterus and others. Following the perinatal period, the commonest cause of acquired inner ear hearing loss in early childhood is bacterial meningitis, with permanent hearing loss complicating up to 30% of affected children, mostly mild or unilateral. However, about 2% of children affected by meningitis develop a bilateral permanent and profound hearing loss. Vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type B and early vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae reduce the risk of developing meningitis as well as the risk for acquired deafness due to meningitis. Other causes include infections (e. g. measles, mumps, varicella), trauma, middle ear diseases and administration of ototoxic drugs. 7.

The external part, called the audio processor, is worn underneath the hair and held in place with a magnet. It contains a microphone, a battery and electronics. The audio processor converts environmental sounds into signals that are transmitted to the implanted internal coil of the Soundbridge. The implanted part consists of the internal coil, magnet, conductor link and the FMT. The signal from the audio processor is transmitted across the skin to the internal coil, which relays the signal down the conductor link to the FMT.

For this reason hearing aids today have been restyled and special attention is given to their \"design\". If a hearing aid is to be accepted it should be perceived as a modern assistive device for communication, an extension of the patient's body, eliminating the sense of shame that the patient feels by wearing a hearing aid. There is a kind of tabu that is linked to dentures, hearing aids, cosmetics for men and in the past to eyeglasses. But today these negative connotations are decreasing and that changes the perception of the abovementioned items. They are no longer disturbing; they may become a part of fashion trends! According to the audiological classification of hearing loss there is a distinction on the basis of the average tone threshold into mild (threshold between 20 and 40 dB), moderate (40-70 dB), severe (70-90 dB) and profound (90-120 dB) hearing loss. The choice of the hearing aid with respect to the above classification takes into account the audiometric curve (flat, symmetrical, asymmetrical, lymph and amplify their natural movement. These vibrations then conduct the sound to the basilar membrane and the organ of Corti. This system is designed for mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss (FMT attached to the incus) or for moderate or severe mixed hearing loss (FMT attached to the round window), e. g. cochlear otosclerosis, malformations of the ear. Another middle ear implant is the middle ear transducer, an implantable hearing device where the sound is transmitted by a similar vibrating driving system attached to the head of the malleus. \u2212 A bone-anchored-hearing aid is a hearing aid fixed to a bone-anchored titanium screw, in which bone conduction is used to transmit sound directly via the skull into the cochlea (Fig. 1.2.4) . \u2212 In deaf patients cochlear implants are used (see Sect. 1.6.12). Sound is transformed by the so-called speech processor to electric signals which are sent to a retroauricular subcutaneously implanted receiver. The receiver is connected with a stimulating electrode which is inserted into the cochlea.",

So the perceived pieces of information do not correspond amongst themselves nor to the expected perception pattern, previously adapted by experience. Principally in all people with an intact sensory system motion, sickness can be induced, if certain conditions which can create a sensory conflict are fulfilled.

The best prevention consists in a vestibular habituation training with the intention to prepare the orientation system for a conflict stimulation. As a medical prophylactic treatment, scopolamine used in the form of a transdermal skin patch can be recommended. When the symptoms of motion sickness appear, one can try to break free from the sensory conflict situation. In the case of seasickness the suffering person has to leave the cabin and should go on the ship's deck. Then he/she should fixate on an object not too far away. In this way there the correspondence between visual and vestibular information",

Prelingual profound hearing loss in adults who have always used analogue hearing aids. In many cases digital hearing aids with custom-made ear moulds can be recommended and when possible cochlear implants.The most frequent complaints that arise from patients using traditional hearing aids are the hearing aid whistles (feedback), loud sounds are uncomfortable, unsatisfactory speech discrimination in noisy surroundings and the perception of the person's own voice altered owing to the occlusion effect of the external auditory canal. To solve these problems today there are digital ITE and BTE hearing aids with artificial intelligence that use technologies capable of improving speech discrimination in noise, eliminating feedback and with the \"open fitting\" system the problems connected to the occlusion effect are resolved.",

            "text": "Fitting hearing aids in children is difficult both for the diagnosis and in the actual fitting. It is essential that children are fitted with hearing aids at a very early stage (within 6-12 months). To obtain the best results, the family must be actively involved in the process, the child must be placed in an adequate scholastic and social environment and followed closely by a speech therapist. To evaluate the results of the fitting, objective audiometric testing (impedance testing, auditory evoked brainstem response, electrocochleography, otoacoustic emissions) is essential. The testing and the evaluation of the hearing aid fitting must be carried out in a medical environment with the cooperation of the audiologist/dispenser. When the child is in Kindergarten it is important to use a personal FM system to eliminate any interference from background noise present in classrooms. Most hearing-impaired children suffer from moderate hearing loss and in those cases a hearing aid is an adequate solution. In cases of profound hearing impairment, after approximately 6 months of hearing aid use and an accurate evaluation of the entity of the hearing loss and after a careful psychological evaluation and speech evaluation, the possibility of a cochlear implant may be considered and must be carried out before the child is 18 months old.",
