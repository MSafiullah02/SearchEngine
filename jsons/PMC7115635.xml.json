            "text": "Rapidly changing global landscapes and local environments, enormous increases in the human population and urbanization in many developing countries, and the advances in the speed and volume of global transportation have created increased opportunities for the emergence and re-emergence of viral diseases. Viruses with RNA as their genetic material can quickly adapt to and exploit these various conditions because of their high genetic variation rates (mutation, recombination and reassortment). Not surprisingly, many prominent recent examples of emerging or re-emerging diseases have been caused by RNA viruses, such as SARS-Coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza viruses, H1N1, HIV, Hantavirus, and West Nile virus [10], [11], [12], [15], [21], [23], [32]. Outbreaks of measles continue, and it is still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide, despite the availability of live attenuated vaccines for more than 30 years [2], [6]. Effective antiviral agents are lacking that specifically target RNA viruses such as measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1. The current available therapies used in the clinic for measles virus infection treatment, which is administered orally or intravenously alone or in combination with immune serum globulin, have demonstrated variable efficacies and side effects such as high teratogenicity and anemia [2], [30], [31]. Many other strategies, such as antisense molecules, adenosine and guanosine nucleosides, brassinosteroids, coumarins, peptide inhibitors, and modulators of cholesterol synthesis, have also failed [2], [25], [26]. Moreover, approved or universally recommended therapies have been lacking for SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 infections until now, even though more and more antiviral agents against SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 have been reported [8], [17], [24]. Therefore, the development of new antiviral agents is needed to provide more options for managing cases of diseases caused by RNA viruses in both developed and developing countries.",

Scorpions use venom as a weapon to subdue prey and to defend against predators. Scorpion venom is a cocktail of peptides and proteins with diverse bioactivities, thus representing an unexplored resource for use in peptide drug design and development [18], [22], [37]. Antimicrobial peptides from scorpion venom have attracted more attention due to their potential application [9], [36]. Although the antibacterial and antifungal activities of AMPs have been the main focus of studies to date, some of these molecules have also been shown to be effective against viral pathogens such as Junin virus, herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, rotavirus, vaccinia virus, HCV and HIV [1], [5], [20], [28], [33].",

We found that mucroporin can effectively inhibit standard bacteria, especially gram-positive bacteria. The optimized design of mucroporin-M1 by amino acid substitution resulted in inhibition of gram-positive bacteria at low concentrations and increased inhibition of antibiotic-resistant pathogens [9]. Recently, we also found a novel \u03b1-helical peptide Hp1090 from scorpion venom can inhibit HCV replication and prevents the initiation of HCV infection [33]. In this investigation, we tested mucroporin and its optimized peptide variant mucroporin-M1 for other bioactivities including antiviral function against measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses. Surprisingly, we found that the virucidal activity of mucroporin-M1 was notably increased, whereas the original peptide mucroporin showed no virucidal activity at all. The results in this report indicate that scorpion venom-derived antimicrobial peptides are not only a natural resource for inhibiting antibiotic-resistant bacteria but also can be molecular templates for designing antiviral peptides and antiviral agents for measles, SARS, influenza and other emerging or re-emerging RNA viral diseases.",

Therefore, we further examined the effects of mucroporin-M1 on SARS-CoV and H5N1 viruses. SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 pseudoviruses were used for this study, which are best safe alternatives at present. We incubated 2.0 \u00d7 104\n RLU/ml of SARS-CoV pseudovirus or 1.0 \u00d7 104\n pfu/ml H5N1 pseudovirus with serially diluted mucroporin-M1 for 1 h in 2% medium and then conducted the titer assay. Mucroporin-M1, but not mucroporin, showed significant inhibitory effects against both SARS-CoV pseudovirus (Fig. 6A) and H5N1 pseudovirus (Fig. 6B and C) in a concentration-dependent manner. Indeed, 20 \u03bcg/ml and 5 \u03bcg/ml of mucroporin-M1 could almost completely inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV pseudovirus and H5N1 pseudovirus, respectively (Fig. 6). The EC50 values of mucroporin-M1 to SARS-CoV and H5N1 pseudoviruses were 14.46 \u03bcg/ml (7.12 \u03bcM) and 2.10 \u03bcg/ml (1.03 \u03bcM), respectively.

Currently used antiviral treatments for MeV infections are limited to ribavirin and/or immune serum globulin [4], [27], which show variable efficacy against different MeV strains. Furthermore, the IC50 value of ribavirin varies from 40 to 500 \u03bcM in vitro\n[3], [14], and therapeutic use of ribavirin is also limited by its side effect such as anemia [2]. Development of novel antiviral agents is needed to close the vaccination gap and treat increasing outbreaks, which urged us to test our scorpion venom-derived peptides for anti-MeV activity and more. In previous work, we isolated different kinds of cationic antimicrobial peptides from a cDNA library of the venomous gland of scorpion and identified their potent growth-inhibitory activity against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive pathogens [9], [18]. Mucroporin is the first cationic host defense peptide that has been isolated from the venom of the scorpion Lychas mucronatus; we recently cloned it and demonstrated its specific effects on inhibiting bacteria [9]. We found that mucroporin can effectively inhibit standard bacteria, especially gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, the mucroporin-M1 optimized by amino acid substitution resulted in inhibition of gram-positive bacteria at low concentrations and inhibition of antibiotic-resistant pathogens [9]. The main aim of this investigation was to further test mucroporin and mucroporin-M1 for their anti-viral activity. We found that the anti-MeV activity of mucroporin-M1 was notably increased by the molecular modifications, while the original peptide mucroporin showed no anti-MeV activity at all. In the optimized modification, the Glycine and Proline residues of mucroporin were replaced with Lysine or Arginine, thereby enhancing the net positive charge of the hydrophilic side and changing the secondary structure of the peptide. The modifications enabled the peptide to interact directly with MeV particles with increased affinity (Fig. 5). The anti-MeV activity of mucroporin-M1 presented an EC50 value of 7.15 \u03bcg/ml (3.52 \u03bcM), while the original peptide mucroporin showed no anti-MeV activity at all. Moreover, we found that mucroporin-M1 could also inactivate two other enveloped RNA viruses: SARS CoV, with an EC50 of 14.46 \u03bcg/ml (7.12 \u03bcM), and influenza H5N1, with an EC50 of 2.10 \u03bcg/ml (1.03 \u03bcM). Although the selective indexes (SI) of mucroporin-M1 to SARS-CoV and H5N1 pseudoviruses shows big diversity (4.26 and 39.69, respectively), our results provide evidence that host defense peptides from scorpion can be modified for antiviral activity by rational design and represent a template approach for developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents.",

Viral entry is an early key stage of viral infection. Many antiviral peptides have been designed to target the virus and cell interaction, such as competitive fusion inhibitors based on the template of the interacting domains of viral ligands and cellular receptors. One particular example of rational drug design is enfuvirtide, an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor (T-20), which functions by disrupting the HIV-1 molecular machinery at the final stage of fusion with the target cell, thereby preventing uninfected cells from becoming infected [19]. Recently, some AMPs from natural resources attracted attention because some of these molecules have been shown to be effective against viral pathogens [1], [5], [28]. A peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4V isolated from soya beans showed very broad-spectrum of antiviral activities against herpes simplex viruses HSV-1 and HSV-2, polio virus and measles virus in addition to its anti-bacterial activities [29]. More natural resources should be screened for their potential antiviral activity. Scorpion venom is a cocktail of peptides and proteins with a diversity of special bioactivities, thus representing an unexplored resource for use in drug design and development [18], [22], [37]. We believe scorpion venom is also a valuable resource for antiviral drug development and tried testing mucroporin-M1 and its original molecular template mucroporin for their anti-MeV activity. We found that mucroporin-M1 can also inactivate two other enveloped RNA viruses, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1.",

            "text": "Mucroporin was reported to kill pathogens by breaking the bacterial membrane [9], but had no anti-measles virus activity. When the Glycine and Proline residues of mucroporin were replaced with Lysine or Arginine, which resulted in mucroporin-M1 with a more net positive charge of the hydrophilic side, mucroporin-M1 could inactivate MeV effectively. Inactivation of MeV was enhanced as the concentrations and treated time of mucroporin-M1 increased, revealing that the mechanism of action of mucroporin-M1 is at least partly due to direct interaction with the measles virus surface. Further studies on the relationship between peptide inhibition and the MeV replication cycle suggest that once the viral attachment step achieved, the peptide is unable to interfere with the following steps of virus replication. Experiments testing various treatment times and orders of addition of mucroporin-M1 revealed that MeV treatment with mucroporin-M1 by mixing together and incubating for 1 h in advance of infecting cells showed the most effective inhibition. Taken together, we speculate that mucroporin-M1 inhibits MeV, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 by direct virucidal action. Mucroporin-M1 may bind to the virus envelope by surface charge interactions and drastically decrease the infectivity of the above three viruses. However, mucroporin has no inhibitory activity against vaccinia virus, an enveloped DNA virus (data not shown). Therefore, whether the mucroporin-M1 functions against the viral surface protein, or just surface lipid, or both need to be investigated further.",

The peptide with dual antimicrobial activities can be also considered as a good additive to antiseptic mouthwashes and handwashes. All in all, the discovery of bioactive mucroporin-M1 suggests that cationic host defense peptides from scorpion venom might be good templates for antiviral peptide design and shows their potential for multifunctional antiviral agents.",
