The Alphacoronavirus genus includes HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, while the Betacoronavirus genus comprises HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus), and the novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E and the betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause common colds, but also severe lower respiratory tract infections, especially in the elderly and children [8]. HCoV-NL63 infection has also been significantly associated with croup (laryngotracheitis) [9, 10], and HCoV-OC43 infection with severe lower respiratory tract infection in children [11].",

As soon as on January 7, 2020, the Chinese health authorities had declared that a novel coronavirus was responsible for this outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, a European network of academic and public laboratories designed an rRT-PCR protocol based on the comparison and alignment of previously available SARS-CoV and bat-related coronavirus genome sequences as well as five sequences derived from the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 made available by the Chinese authorities [23]. Three assays were developed. The first-line assay targets the E gene encoding for the envelope protein, which is common to the Sarbecovirus subgenus, while the second specific assay targets the RdRp gene encoding for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This assay contains two probes: one probe, which reacts with the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene, and a second probe (RdRP_SARSr-P2) which is specific to SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the third additional confirmatory assay targets the nucleocapsid (N) gene. This last assay was not further validated because it is slightly less sensitive [23]. This protocol was adopted in more than 30 European laboratories [24]. Recently, a novel rRT-PCR assay targeting a different region of the RdRp/Hel gene of SARS-CoV-2 has been developed that showed a higher sensitivity and specificity than the RdRp-P2 assay [25].",

The S protein is composed of the two subunits S1 and S2 responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, respectively. Different coronaviruses use different domains within the S1 subunit to enter the cell. These domains are named SA and SB. SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via domain SB to enter target cells [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. It has recently been shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds the ACE2 receptor via the SB domain similarly to SARS-CoV, and that murine polyclonal antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell mediated by S. These data suggest that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes elicited by vaccination could be used against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and SARS-related coronaviruses [35].",

Phylogenetic analysis and homology modeling add new knowledge together with epidemiological and diagnostic methods. Studies exploring the genome and the structure of the viral proteins are essential in order to define prevention and control measures to minimize the impact of the outbreak. All this knowledge will pave the way for the development of a vaccine and antiviral therapy.",
