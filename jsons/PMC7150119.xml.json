The inguinal canals are open in the male mouse, and the testes can retract easily into the abdominal cavity. Both sexes have well-developed preputial glands, which can become infected. Males have a number of accessory sex glands, including large seminal vesicles, coagulating glands, and a prostate. Secretions from these glands make up a large part of the mouse's ejaculate.

The origins of the laboratory rat, also known as the Norway rat, stretch back centuries to the areas of modern day China and Mongolia (Burt, 2006, Song et al., 2014). The dispersal of the Norway rat has occurred across the centuries and its natural habitat stretches from the Mediterranean across Southeast Asia and down into Australia and New Guinea (Song et al., 2014). Unfortunately, most people associate rats with disease and destruction. Throughout history, outbreaks of bubonic plague, typhus, and hantaviruses have had an unwitting accomplice in the rat (Zinsser, 1935, Benedictow, 2004, Firth et al., 2014). Over the centuries, rats have also been used for food (e.g., in Imperial China), companionship, and sport (Gorn and Goldstein, 2004, Hopkins et al., 2004, Burt, 2006). Ratting, a vicious blood sport where people laid bets on the dog that could kill the most rats in a given period of time was especially popular in both the Victorian England and American Underworld (Thomas and Mayhew, 1998, Gorn and Goldstein, 2004). At the turn of the 20th century, breeding rats as a hobby or for companionship (i.e., \u201cfancy rats\u201d) was recognized by the addition of \u201crat\u201d to both the name and mission of National Mouse Club in the United Kingdom (American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association, 2014). However, as interest in pet rats waned over the following years, the club reorganized and dropped \u201crat\u201d from its name. A similar club, the American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association, was founded in the United States in 1983 (American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association, 2014).",

Behaviors exhibited by rats include grooming, nesting, eating, and other social behaviors. Nesting behavior serves several purposes among rats and mice (Gaskill et al., 2012, Gaskill et al., 2013a, Gaskill et al., 2013b, Gaskill et al., 2013c). Nests allow for better thermoregulatory control within a given environment as well as protection against predation (Gaskill et al., 2013c). Recent work in mice suggests that energy not diverted to thermoregulation can be shunted to other activities as seen via improved feed conversion and breeding performance (Gaskill et al., 2013c). However, anecdotal evidence suggests that nest building in rats is largely a learned behavior, and it appears that there is a developmental period in young rats whereupon if exposed to nesting materials during this time they will begin using the materials to build at least rudimentary nests (Gaskill, 2014). At a minimum, rats benefit from having a structural shelter or nest box into which they may rest away from prying eyes (Fig. 7.7\n).",

The earliest archeological evidence of the coexistence of humans and rabbits can be found in excavation sites dated at approximately 120,000 years BCE in Nice, France (Dickenson, 2013). In antiquity, Romans used rabbits as a food source and are thought to be responsible for their dispersal throughout Europe, although there is no evidence that they attempted to actually domesticate them (Dickenson, 2013). Domestication and selective breeding is thought to have begun in France in the Middle Ages where monks began to breed rabbits in their monasteries (Dickenson, 2013). The rabbits were kept confined in enclosures called \u201cclapiers\u201d(Dickenson, 2013). They were kept largely as a source of food for the monks especially since 600 CE when Pope Gregory I officially classified them as \u201cfish\u201d and thus eligible to being eaten during Lent. However, rabbit wool production soon became a welcome by-product of these domestication efforts.",

Rabbits are routinely used in atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, ocular, and immunology research (Southard et al., 2000, Arslan et al., 2003, McMahon et al., 2005, Castaneda et al., 2008, Habjanec et al., 2008, Manabe et al., 2008, Xiangdong et al., 2011, Panda et al., 2014, Sriram et al., 2014, Wei et al., 2014, Zhou et al., 2014). The production of polyclonal antibodies is preferentially performed in the rabbit due to its relatively large blood volume compared to rodents (Hanly et al., 1995). Their tractable nature and larger body size also make them suitable for surgical implantation of biomedical devices (Gotfredsen et al., 1995, Swindle et al., 2005, Ronisz et al., 2013). Additionally, rabbits are a favored model in pharmacologic studies for teratogenicity testing of novel pharmaceutic compounds (Gibson et al., 1966, Lloyd et al., 1999, Foote and Carney, 2000, Jiangbo et al., 2009, Oi et al., 2011).",

In addition, the central ear artery and marginal ear veins are easily accessible for both intravenous administration and blood sampling (Diehl et al., 2001, Parasuraman et al., 2010) (Fig. 7.10\n). The ears also serve as a means of thermoregulation, as excess heat may be exchanged across the large surface area of the ears (Sohn and Couto, 2012). The skin of rabbits lacks sweat glands and is therefore unable to sweat; panting is insufficient to dissipate the excess heat (Sohn and Couto, 2012). Thus, the ears play a vital role in maintaining proper body temperature. Other unique features of the skin and adnexa are the presence of chin and inguinal glands used in scent marking. Additionally, the female rabbit (doe) is noted by the presence of a large skin fold filled with subcutaneous fat just under the chin (the dewlap) (Sohn and Couto, 2012).",

The ileum connects to the cecum via a structure called the sacculus rotundus. The presence of lymph follicles suggests that the sacculus rotundus has immunological functions. It is sometimes referred to as the ileocecal \u201ctonsil\u201d (Jenkins, 2000).

Rabbits are considered to be \u201chindgut fermenters.\u201d Bacteria present in the cecum ferment the digestible fiber found within the diet. The product of this fermentative process becomes cecotrophs (also known as \u201cnight feces\u201d). Cecotrophs are excreted roughly 8 h after the initial foodstuffs are ingested (Sohn and Couto, 2012). They are softer and more mucoid in appearance than the hard, dry \u201cday feces\u201d produced just 4 h after consuming food (Sohn and Couto, 2012). The bulk of day feces consists of the indigestible fiber found in the diet. The sorting of foodstuffs destined to become either day feces or cecotrophs and the timing of their relative excretion is largely dependent upon the neural input of the fusus coli, also termed the \u201cpacemaker\u201d of the colon (Sohn and Couto, 2012). The fusus coli is anatomically located between the ascending and transverse colons of the rabbit (Popesko, 1992). Consumption of cecotrophs by rabbits is an important part of the digestive process in rabbits as they are rich in B vitamins, such as niacin and B12, and vitamin K (H\u00f6rnicke, 1981). While cecotrophs are known colloquially as \u201cnight feces,\u201d rabbits produce and eat them at all hours of the day (Sohn and Couto, 2012). Rabbits are agile enough to eat these night feces directly from their anus (Sohn and Couto, 2012). Those researchers performing digestive research (e.g., fecal collection via metabolism cages) should keep this in mind.",

Rabbits will rub the secretions from their chin scent glands against inanimate objects, other rabbits, and human handlers in a process called \u201cchinning\u201d (Sohn and Couto, 2012). Dominance hierarchies are established behaviorally. Dominant animals may mount, \u201cbarber,\u201d or scent-mark subordinates (Sohn and Couto, 2012). Barbering is the act of chewing the hair of a subordinate animal, usually on the neck and back in the case of rabbits, very close to the skin giving the appearance of having been cut or \u201cbarbered\u201d (Bays, 2006). Rabbits will \u201cthump\u201d one or both back feet on the ground when frightened or as an alarm call to other rabbits (Bays, 2006). Highly stressed rabbits may actually emit a loud, piercing scream, especially when roughly caught by an untrained individual (Bays, 2006). It is important to approach rabbits calmly and quietly. Relaxed, content rabbits may be heard making a purring sound (Bays, 2006). Rabbits benefit by repeated, positive interactions with people similar to the concept of \u201cgentling\u201d in rats (see Section 7.2).",

Bar chewing, chewing on the water bottle, and self-barbering are all stereotypical behaviors seen in rabbits (Gunn and Morton, 1995, Chu et al., 2004). In addition, rabbits may engage in \u201cnose sliding\u201d against solid surfaces like the cage walls and head swaying (Sohn and Couto, 2012). Animals that exhibit stereotypies do not make good research animals. Efforts should be made, where possible, to prevent these behaviors through the use of environmental enrichment. Enrichment may be in the form of chew-resistant objects (such as plastic dumbbells and stainless steel rattles) and food treats (Poggiagliolmi et al., 2011). As a prey species, rabbits benefit from the inclusion of a hut in the cage or at least a visual barrier into which they may retreat when psychologically stressed (Baumans, 2005). Breeding females should always have access to a nest box to allow for the necessary expression of normal nesting behavior (Baumans, 2005).\n",

In the mid-1970s, publications increased to about 40 per year, doubling again in the 1980s, increasing to almost 200 articles per year in the early 1990s, and rapidly expanding to 1929 publications by 2012.",

With the onset of monsoon rains, they move to flooded, highly vegetated shallow wetlands and floodplains, including rice paddies, with little to no current and often silt bottoms for spawning (Engeszer et al., 2007). The offspring then develop in these waters until the seasonal waters diminish (Engeszer et al., 2007). Zebrafish rapidly mature, reaching sexual maturity as early as 2 months postfertilization (Lawrence et al., 2012). The zebrafish continues to grow throughout life, which is much longer in captivity, with a mean lifespan of 3.5 years in captivity (Gerhard et al., 2002).",

Males within the group pursue females, with spawning occurring along the substrate (Spence et al., 2008). Similar behaviors are noted in laboratory zebrafish, with spawning often occurring with the first light of day. Courtship behavior involves a rapid chase of the female, the male swimming around the female, nudging her, or swimming back and forth working the female to the spawning site. Interestingly, zebrafish prefer spawning near artificial plants. Once there, the male remains close to the female, extending his fins to bring his genital pore in line with the female. The male may also rapidly undulate his tail against the side of the female to initiate egg release by the female, coinciding with sperm discharge by the male. The female produces eggs in batches of 5\u201320 over several encounters with the male for up to an hour. Most eggs are released within the first 30 min, with a peak in production during the first 10 min (Darrow and Harris, 2004, Spence et al., 2008).",

First body movements and beginning stages of organ development occur 10\u201324 h postfertilization (Kimmel et al., 1995). As development continues, the larva hatches from the egg two to three days postfertilization (Kimmel et al., 1995).

            "text": "In contrast to research in mammals, there is a tendency for reptile and amphibian research to be more oriented to studying evolution and ecology as opposed to basic science evaluating models of human disease (Pough, 1991). Salamanders and frogs are important for studying embryonic development, metamorphosis, regeneration, physiology, and climate change (Burggren and Warburton, 2007, Hopkins, 2007, Pough, 2007). Reptiles are often studied because of their more simple cardiovascular systems as well as for evaluating mechanisms of immune responses, hormonal controls, and unique reproduction methods such as parthenogenesis (Frye, 1991). Of the amphibians, Xenopus laevis (South African clawed frog) and Xenopus tropicalis (Western clawed frog) are commonly studied in the research setting. X. laevis is a prominent research model in comparative medicine and developmental studies, and is the most commonly studied species in the genus Xenopus (Denardo, 1995, Schultz and Dawson, 2003, O'Rourke, 2007). Advantages include large-sized eggs for ease of observing embryo development, as well as the wealth of published literature in areas of research such as evolution, neurobiology, regeneration, endocrinology, and toxicology (Koustubhan et al., 2008, Gibbs et al., 2011). Rana catesbeiana (bullfrogs) have been used for developmental and toxicological studies, and for infectious disease study of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Alworth and Vazquez, 2009). A. mexicanum, in particular, is studied to understand the regenerative ability of the blastema of amputated limbs at the molecular level (Gresens, 2004, Rao et al., 2014). Ambystoma tigrarium has been studied in regard to general amphibian decline in North America, environmental contaminants such as pesticides and effects of infection with A. tigrarium virus (Sheafor et al., 2008, Kerby and Storfer, 2009, Chen and Robert, 2011, Kerby et al., 2011). A variety of snakes, crocodiles, lizards, and turtles have been studied in research. For example, Anolis carolinensis (the green anole) has been used for the study of reproduction biology (Lovern et al., 2004). Caiman crocodilus and Alligator mississippiensis (crocodiles), Trachemys scripta elegans (red-eared sliders) represent a few other examples of reptiles used in research (O'Rourke and Schumacher, 2002).",

X. laevis and X. tropicalis are from geographically distinct areas and have different temperature requirement depending on life stage, with X. tropicalis adults generally around 25\u00b0C in their natural habitat versus about 20\u00b0C for X. laevis (Tinsley et al., 2010). The skin of amphibians is permeable to water and some adults (semiterrestrial tree frogs in family Hylidae, arboreal and terrestrial toads in Bufonidae) may receive a significant portion of their daily water requirement via absorption through a vascular-rich area on the pelvic area termed the pelvic patch (Pough, 2007, Ogushi et al., 2010). The skin of some amphibians contains toxins which can cause arrhythmias in human handlers, for example, alkaloids from dendrobatid frogs, and bufotoxins from toads of the genus Bufo (DeNardo, 1995). The toxins serve to keep predators away but, as with Xenopus, may harm the animals themselves by continued direct contact or diffusion through the water (Tinsley, 2010, Chum et al., 2013). The skin of amphibians is easily damaged thus to protect the animal during handling powder-free gloves should be worn (Gentz, 2007).",

In the wild, amphibians and reptiles live in ecological environments that span a range of diversity from topical forest areas to dry desert. They may be arboreal, aquatic, or terrestrial. They are often secretive and hide when in natural habitats, preferring to hide under vegetation or in crevices. Parameters from the natural habitat to evaluate include temperature, humidity, nutritional requirements, natural diet, nocturnal versus diurnal behavior, and housing density. Temperature and lighting gradients should be established so animals can choose to move toward or away from the heat source as a way to avoid overheating. Most amphibian species in the wild are nocturnal (Pough, 2007, Tinsley, 2010).",

Scents, sounds, and color choices may also be incorporated into enrichment strategies provided that they are carefully evaluated to ensure that they are beneficial and do not cause stress. For example, the tortoise, Chelonoidis denticulata, may show a color preference for red-colored enrichment items (Passos et al., 2014). PVC tubes are another example of enrichment that has been provided to X. laevis for use as hiding cover (Koustubhan et al., 2008).

The genomes of several avian species have now been sequenced (Jarvis et al., 2014). Historically, chickens (Gallus domesticus) are the most common bird species studied in biomedical and agricultural research and are a classic model in areas such as immunology, virology, infectious disease, embryology, and toxicology (Scanes and McNabb, 2003, Kaiser, 2012). Chickens are also studied to evaluate reproductive development and retinal disease. Embryonated chicken eggs have been used to commercially produce vaccines (such as for human influenza), studied for developmental analysis, and are now being treated with viral vectors like lentivirus to produce transgenic embryos. Inbred lines with improved disease resistance are being developed and transgenic technology in the future may allow embryos to be used as bioreactors to produce therapeutic proteins of interest and potentially to generate transgenic chickens which have improved resistance to pathogens (Bacon et al., 2000, Scott et al., 2010). Because chickens develop spontaneous ovarian cancers at an incidence of up to 35%, they are also a prominent model of ovarian cancer in humans (Bahr and Wolf, 2012, Hawkridge, 2014). Quail (Coturnix coturnix and Coturnix japonica) have been studied in many of the same research disciplines as chickens, but offer advantages because of their smaller size and because they are among the shortest-lived bird species (Austad, 1997). Japanese quail (C. japonica) have been selected as a model to evaluate reproductive biology and social behaviors such as mate selection because they readily show sexual behavior in captivity (Ball and Balthazart, 2010). As with the chicken, methods to study transgenic quail are now becoming available and offer a useful tool to study gene function (Seidl et al., 2013).",

Zebra finches and other songbirds are commonly studied in regard to aging and neurogenesis in addition to speech, learning, and memory because of their ability to learn and communicate intricate bird songs (Harding, 2004, Scott et al., 2010, Austad, 2011, Mello, 2014). The most popular songbird species for neurobiological research include the zebra finch, canary, and other types of small finches such as Lonchura striata domestica (Schmidt, 2010). Zebra finches are favored in research settings since they are easy to house due to their small size, for their compatibility in groups, and proclivity for breeding. They are also studied for their biologic features such as sexual dimorphism, year-round singing in captivity, age-dependent period of song-learning propensity, and for ease of measurement with respect to their bird song (Fee and Scharff, 2010, Mello, 2014). Pigeons (Columba livia) have been evaluated in areas such as comparative psychology, neuroanatomy, neuroendocrinology, and atherosclerosis (Santerre et al., 1972, Austad, 1997, Shanahan et al., 2013). They are studied to understand their navigational skills and memory which allow homing, vision and discrimination ability. Barn owls (Tyto alba) are an example of a nocturnal avian species and are studied for neuroanatomy, vision, hearing, and for understanding learning mechanisms during auditory space mapping (Pena and Debello, 2010, Rosania, 2014).",

Their respiratory system includes avascular air sacs, some of which attach to the lung and bronchi, but do not serve as sites for gas exchange as does the lung (Maina, 2006, Ritchie et al., 1994). Air sacs serve as internal compartments which hold air and facilitate internal air passage to allow birds to have a continuous flow of large volumes of air through the lungs as a way to increase oxygen exchange capacity and efficiency. Birds lack a functional diaphragm and use muscles of the thorax to assist with respiration (Ritchie et al., 1994). Care must be taken to ensure that use of physical restraint does not interfere with respiratory movement, cause the bird to struggle, or become stressed. The skeletal system includes pneumatic bones which are lined with air sac epithelium and are considered pneumatized by connection to the respiratory system (Frandson et al., 2009). The specific bones which are pneumatized depend on the species but typically include the humerus, cervical vertebrae, sternum, sternal ribs, and sometimes the femur (Ritchie et al., 1994).",

            "text": "Housing requirements of birds held in captivity vary significantly depending on the particular species. Basic parameters that apply to all birds include the necessity to provide an enclosure which is safe and permits species-specific behaviors to the greatest extent possible. Consideration should be given to ensure that the type of structure is nontoxic, as some birds such as parrots have a powerful beak with the ability to chew through substrates. Enclosures may be made of metals or durable plastic, but it is important to note that zinc wire, as well as leaded paint, can be toxic to birds and is best avoided. Bar spacing on caging should be appropriate to prevent escape and injury based on the size of the bird. Caging size varies and can include large aviaries where full short-distance flight is possible, to individual housing in smaller sized cages where flight may not be feasible. Use of environmental enrichment and provision of opportunity for interaction is important to include as part of the cage structure, complexity, and social dynamic. Some types of birds are considered social, polygamous, and benefit from group housing, whereas others such as those that pair-bond (such as New World quail) may prefer housing with a single mate (Ritchie et al., 1994). Some species, genders, or individuals show aggression and may not be compatible. For example, sexually active male quail may injure each other and are generally considered incompatible (Huss et al., 2008). To help reduce aggression, housing densities should be kept low and multiple points of access to resources, such as feed and perches, should be provided.",

Toys should be size appropriate for the species, easily sanitized, free from sharp edges, and replaced once wear shows. Birds can become easily caught in items that hang from the cage and as toys deteriorate they can become a hazard. For example, rope toys may begin to fray and become a hazard, causing entrapment; and some types of toys contain weights which pose a choking hazard or may be made of toxic materials such as lead. Some types of birds spend considerable time perching and require perches, which vary in diameter, for comfort and to prevent pressure sores from developing on their feet.",

Although many birds are seed eaters, a diet of seeds alone is unlikely to provide adequate or balanced nutrition. Many birds have a requirement for dietary calcium, especially those that are reproductively active, and should be provided with calcium supplementation in the form of soluble grit such as cuttlebone or crushed oyster shells (Sandmeier and Coutteel, 2006, Tully et al., 2009). Birds often display neophobic behavior and may require long acclimation periods before fully accepting novel foodstuffs. For this reason, dietary changes should not be made abruptly and daily intake should be closely monitored. For birds in the laboratory setting, clean, fresh water should be provided daily either by use of nonbreakable bowls or sipper tubes. Water intake will vary by species and environmental housing conditions.",

A healthy bird should have well-groomed feathers, appear alert, active and inquisitive, and should show species-typical behaviors. Its eyes should be clear and bright. No evidence of discharge should be present from the eyes, nares, mouth, or urogenital area.

They are small, stocky, nonburrowing, crepuscular herbivores with short legs and little to no tail, ranging from 700 to 1200 g, females being smaller than males (Harkness et al., 2010). Guinea pigs have a long-standing historical role in research stretching as far back as the 1600s, when they were first used in anatomical studies (Pritt, 2012). Further, they were used by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch in their investigations of infectious disease, and have contributed to the work of several Nobel Prize worthy studies (Pritt, 2012). Specifically, the guinea pig has been used as a model for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, Legionnaires disease, sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and syphilis, and one of the more common causes of nosocomial infections in people, Staphylococcus aureus (Padilla-Carlin et al., 2008). Guinea pigs have also been useful tools in researching cholesterol metabolism, asthma, fetus and placental development and aspects of childbirth, as well as Alzheimer's disease (Bahr and Wolf, 2012).",

There are over 100 species of gerbil-like rodents documented, but the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) is the species most commonly used in the United States (Fig. 7.24\n). Mongolian gerbils originate from a desert terrain in Mongolia and northeast China. They are long-tailed, burrowing, herbivorous rodents, 55\u2013130 g in size, males being larger than females (Harkness et al., 2010). Due to anatomical variations in the blood supply to the brain in an anatomical region known as the \u201cCircle of Willis,\u201d gerbils have been used most notably as a model for cerebral ischemia or stroke (Small and Buchan, 2000).",

Armadillos have a banded carapace, and, importantly, a low core body temperature of 33\u201335\u00b0C. The breeding season is in the summer, but embryo implantation is delayed until late fall, at which point identical quadruplicates are always formed (Balamayooran et al., 2015). The armadillo's low body temperature, and susceptibility and physiologic response to the infectious organism, Mycobacterium leprae, have made it an ideal model for studying leprosy (Balamayooran et al., 2015). The consistent polyembryony of the species has also made the animal a model of interest in understanding various aspects of twinning (Blickstein and Keith, 2007).",
