Furthermore, at the Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD VII) held in Yokohama, Japan in August 2019, the Yokohama Declaration 2019 was adopted to promote a robust and sustainable society for human security in Africa region, including the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and African Union (AU) Agenda 2063 as well as UHC [3].

For Japan, in 2013, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued the Global Health Diplomacy Strategy, officially positioning health as a pillar of government foreign diplomacy [4, 5]. As one of the concrete measures, the strategy aims to ensure human security by promoting UHC in developing countries using DAH [6]. Human security, as an universal definition, \u201cprotects the vital core of all human lives in ways that enhance human freedoms and human fulfillment\u201d [7]. Through its contribution to health, the DAH helps build the human capital necessary for economic development [8], resulting in greater self-reliance of recipient countries [9]. Also, in an increasingly interconnected world, epidemics, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and other health threats are easily spread, and efforts to prevent or suppress these threats in one country often benefit neighboring and distant countries [10]. The DAH therefore can provide a way for donors and recipient countries to benefit and share global prosperity [11].",

In 1992, the ODA Charter was created by the Cabinet Office with Asia as a priority region, indicating the basic principles of supporting the economic growth and social development of developing countries through ODA [17]. In 2015, it was revised for the second time since the revision in 2003, and the name was changed to \u201cDevelopment Cooperation Charter\u201d [18]. The core of this revised, new Charter is a deep commitment to a proactive contribution to peace standing on the concept of human security [5]. It also added measures that have not been considered within the framework of ODA, such as strengthening cooperation with private sectors; and clarified that ODA for military operations must be limited to non-military purposes, such as disaster relief. It puts emphasis not only on the interests of developing countries, but also on securing \u2018national interests\u2019, indicating Japan\u2019s willingness to actively engage in international cooperation that would contribute to Japan\u2019s security and economic growth. In the same year, MOFA also published the \u201cBasic Design for Peace and Health (Global Health Cooperation)\u201d as a guideline for global health policy under the new Charter. In this guideline, they put three areas as their priority: promotion of resilient global health governance able to respond to public health crises and natural disasters based on the concept of human security, including the realization of UHC; utilization of Japanese expertise, experience, medical products and technologies; and tailored support in response to diversification of regional needs [19].",

Step 1: based on reports from multilateral agencies to the OECD [28], ODA flows to the health sector of each agency (i.e., DAH) were calculated as a percentage of total ODA disbursements (\u03b1: health sector share of the agency\u2019s total ODA). Step 2: based on this report [28], each agency\u2019s DAH flows to each target country/region and each health focus area were calculated (\u03b2: target country/region-specific share of the agency\u2019s DAH, and \u03b3: health focus area-specific share of the agency\u2019s DAH). Step 3: multiplying \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 obtained for each multilateral agency by the total ODA from Japan, we estimated flows of Japan\u2019s DAH through the agency. For example, the MOF\u2019s multilateral DAH through the World Bank was estimated by multiplying the total ODA from the MOF to the World Bank by \u03b1. In addition, MOF\u2019s DAH through the World Bank to a particular target country/region and health focus area was estimated as total ODA \u00d7 \u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b2 and total ODA \u00d7 \u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b3, respectively.",

(2015) attempted to define DAH on \u2018PHC delivery\u2019 versus on \u2018health system strengthening (HSS)\u2019 in support of PHC delivery, using CRS purpose code data, and our study followed their definition and methodology and estimated how much Japan\u2019s DAH was invested in PHC and HSS [31]. In short, as in the previous study, our working definition of PHC focused only on inputs that are under the control of the health system itself, so intersectoral interventions (e.g., safe water, sanitation, and hygiene) were not considered. Our scope of PHC therefore included treatment of diseases and injuries, including the provision of essential medicines; reproductive health; prevention, detection and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; public health measures, preventive health care, promotion and education of healthy behavior, good nutrition, and immunization. In this study, we referred to DHA for such scope as being most relevant to \u2018PHC delivery\u2019.",

Human security approach thus enriches the synergy between measures to address these issues. For example, among the nearly one million Rohingyas, an Islamic minority group, living in a refugee camp in Bangladesh, there is a growing concern about a serious infectious disease epidemic, including measles, cholera, and typhoid [40]. Also, as global warming progresses, the distribution of vectors such as mosquitoes that transmit Japanese encephalitis, dengue fever, malaria, and yellow fever, may expand [41, 42]. Human security approach will also contribute to the achievement of SDGs as well as AU Agenda 2063 by building a healthy, sustainable, and stable society. An important issue in the DAH strategy for donors is therefore to consider how donors should fund their human security efforts from a limited ODA budget, and in particular what is the optimal role of DAH in this context.",

Caution is needed that while human security as a rationale for linking foreign policy and health introduces significant political power, sufficient attention must be paid to the possibility that national security interests may be skewed towards health and humanitarian issues [46]. It should also be noted that treating global health issues as national security threats, rather than universal issues to be concerned with the humanity, may cause an excessive concern surrounding diseases surveillance and a divide between affected countries and non-affected countries. In the past, for example, securitization was misused as a rationale for implementing HIV-based travel, migration, and immigration control policies and laws prohibiting the entry of people living with HIV [47].",

However, it is imperative to expand the delivery of PHC in countries undergoing health transition in terms of health promotion and disease prevention and treatment in response to NCDs [51]. With limited resources, several studies suggested the need to take a diagonal approach of HSS to address NCDs, rather than disease-specific, vertical programs [52, 53]. HSS has the potential to improve the delivery of PHC in a cost-effective manner by dealing with the wide range of health problems encountered in health transition. HSS are emerging important focus of some multilateral agencies, such as the World Bank and the Global Fund (Japan\u2019s major DAH channels), as well as the Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.",

Between 2012 and 2016, 31.80\u201348.59% of Japan\u2019s DAH went to infectious diseases control including HIV/AIDS, which has aligned with disease burden in LMICs to some extent (or lower), where infectious disease accounted for about 40\u201350% of the total disease burden in LMICs [55]. Importantly, Japan\u2019s DAH allocation should take full account of the health transition of DAH-recipient countries and make the burden of disease an important criterion for prioritizing resource allocation [12].
