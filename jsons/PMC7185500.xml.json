A surgical intervention routinely performed in female rabbits and which requires general anaesthesia is ovariohysterectomy. For largely unknown reasons, anaesthesia of rabbits carries a high mortality risk in comparison with dogs and cats (Brodbelt 2009). Possible anaesthetic risk factors in rabbits include; a high stress level, high prevalence of clinical and subclinical disease, small body size and relatively small lungs. Moreover, rabbits are not routinely endotracheally intubated and possibly are less carefully monitored during anaesthesia compared with cats and dogs (Brodbelt 2006). In addition, anaesthesia in rabbits has been studied less than in the aforementioned species.",

            "text": "Anaesthesia can be achieved with inhalation or injection of anaesthetic drugs. Some benefits of using inhalation anaesthesia are that most veterinarians are familiar with the technique and that anaesthetic depth can be precisely controlled. Sevoflurane (SEVO) has a lower blood: gas partition coefficient (0.7) than isoflurane (1.4), resulting in more rapid induction and recovery and possibly a greater ability to control anaesthetic depth. Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) has the benefit of separating provision of anaesthesia from ventilation and reducing atmospheric pollution. If rapidly metabolized drugs which action can be antagonized are administered by target control infusion, adjustment of anaesthetic depth and time to recovery is rapid. High dose opioid anaesthesia provides cardiovascular stability in humans as well as in dogs (Bovill et al. 1984; Benson et al. 1987; Flecknell et al. 1989). In human cardiac surgery, sufentanil-based protocols have been shown to be superior to fentanyl in respect of cardiac output and haemodynamic stability during and after anaesthesia (Howie et al. 1991; Sato et al. 1995). In combination with midazolam, sufentanil has been shown to produce safe surgical anaesthesia in cardiovascularly compromised dogs suffering from gastric dilatation/volvulus (Hellebrekers & Sap 1991) and doses have been established in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits premedicated with medetomidine (Hedenqvist et al. 2013; Larsson et al. 2014). Similarly to opioids, alpha-2-adrenergic agonists have been shown to reduce the surgical stress response in humans and dogs, which may prevent cardiac complications (Wijeysundera et al. 2009). Our aim was to compare sufentanil-midazolam (SUF-MID) anaesthesia with SEVO anaesthesia in medetomidine premedicated Himalayan rabbits regarding cardio-respiratory variables, lactate, glucose and recovery after surgery. Our hypothesis was that SUF-MID would have less effect on cardiovascular and metabolic variables than would SEVO.",

The anaesthetic period was divided into surgical preparations (PREP) and surgery (SUR), since the dose of anaesthesia was adjusted to the different requirements, and thereby may have had an effect on the variables studied. Moreover, since the time-points for the start of PREP, SUR and the post-operative period (POST) differed in each rabbit, mean values were calculated for every rabbit for repeated measures analyses (HR, SpO2, PaCO2, PaO2, MAP, RT, blood glucose and lactate) during PREP, SUR and POST. Individual means were used to establish group means. Group means for PREP, SUR and POST were compared with values recorded during sedation (SED) in a two way repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc test. Postoperative body weights were compared with body weights on the day of surgery in a two way repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc test.

Two rabbits in group SEVO needed hand feeding on the first post-operative day. In three rabbits, one in group SUF-MID and two in group SEVO, dry necrosis of part of the ear developed in the area of arterial catheter placement within a week after surgery. Two of these rabbits were the same as those showing neurological symptoms. At necropsy an area of coagulative necrosis in the cerebral cortex was observed in the rabbit with the tilted head.

The overall quality of anaesthesia was similar for both groups, although SEVO was associated with an increase in HR during and after surgery, and a postoperative body weight loss of 4%. Anaesthesia with SUF-MID, in contrast, was associated with a stable HR during surgery and a stable postoperative body weight. One reason for considering opioid-based anaesthesia, is the limited cardiovascular effects, which has been documented to be the case for SUF-MID in rabbits (Hedenqvist et al. 2014) and dogs (Hellebrekers & Sap 1991) previously. In humans it was shown that sufentanil blunts the stress response during surgery, as well as post-operatively (Desborough & Hall 1989), and that a reduced stress response decreases the risk of cardiac complications during surgery (Wijeysundera et al. 2009).",

Since the rabbits were additionally part of a pain behaviour study (results reported elsewhere), it was necessary to postpone buprenorphine administration for facial pain scoring to be possible before the administration of further analgesics. Since the first rabbits in group SUF-MID remained sedated for 3 hours, that time point was selected for the scoring. However, all rabbits received carprofen pre-operatively; hence, they were not completely devoid of analgesic treatment. Five rabbits were administered naloxone or atipamezole postoperatively, but we anticipate that it did not have an impact on pain scoring 3 hours after surgery.",

In a previous study with SUF-MID anesthesia, buprenorphine was administered immediately after 60 minutes of orthopedic surgery in rabbits, and rabbits recovered within 30 minutes (Hedenqvist et al. 2014).

Alfentanil has been shown to induce convulsions more easily in humans compared with sufentanil and fentanyl (Smith et al. 1989). In the present study, anaesthesia was induced slowly to prevent rigidity and convulsions, with a SUF-MID ratio that was established not to cause rigidity in a previous study (Hedenqvist et al. 2013). Rigidity may also have been prevented by the use of medetomidine pre-medication. Medetomidine has been shown to reduce induced seizures in rats (Airaksinen et al. 2012). In more recent studies, sufentanil-midazolam anaesthesia induction has been simplified by using a higher initial infusion rate, and omitting the bolus administration (personal observation, P Hedenqvist).",

Physiological saline was used as lock solution in the arterial catheters. which has been described to be satisfactory in studies in humans (Del Cotillo et al. 2008). Ear necrosis, which also occurred in the present study, has been described in small rabbits after catheterization of the auricular artery (Harcourt-Brown 2002). Catheter placement was found more difficult in Himalayan rabbits compared with the larger NZW rabbit. Complications from arterial catheterisation are less likely to occur in the clinic, since blood pressure is not usually measured invasively. Whenever catheter placement is performed however, great care must be taken not to damage the artery and heparinized saline should be used as lock solution.",
