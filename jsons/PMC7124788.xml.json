Despite decades of implementation of control strategies, mastitis continues to be one of the most significant and economically challenging problems of dairy cows [2]. According to estimations of the National Mastitis Council (USA), mastitis costs more than 2 billion $, to dairy farmers annually [3].",

Briefly, 50 \u03bcl of undiluted milk sample were placed on sheep blood agar (Oxoid Company) and incubated aerobically at 37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C for 22 \u00b1 2 h.

These plates were incubated aerobically at 37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C for 48 \u00b1 2 h and for 24 \u00b1 2 h, respectively. After the end of the incubation time, bacteria were identified according to colony morphology, gram-staining, catalase reaction and other biochemical reactions (i.e. DNAse activity, coagulase test, heamolysis pattern, lactose, catalase, indole reaction and esculin hydrolysis), as appropriate. More precisely, for Gram-positive cocci, which were cultivated in mannitol salt agar, catalase-tests were used to differentiate between catalase-positive staphylococci and catalase-negative cocci. DNAse activity, colony morphology, coagulase tube test and hemolysis pattern were used to discriminate S. aureus from CNS. Oxidase negative E. coli, which were cultivated in McConkey agar, were distinguished from other coliforms due to the lactose, catalase and indole positive activity on 44 \u00b0C. Finally, catalase as well as esculin negative streptococci, which were cultivated in sheep blood agar, were identified according to the hemolytic reaction. Colonies, on mannitol salt and McConkey agars, were counted (CFU/ml) in order to estimate the bacterial population of staphylococci (S. aureus and CNS) and E. coli [24].",

This is due to the fact that S. aureus can be transmitted from the infected mammary gland of the cows to unbred and pregnant heifers, especially with vectors such as flies [7,13,36]. The percentages of infection with S. aureus, among heifers, range from 0.6 to 8% [31]. Ryman et al. [14] reported a much higher (59.5%) prevalence of S. aureus intramammary infections in heifers than this reported by Fox et al. [31]. According to Ryman et al. [14], this result was attributed to the role that horn flies play in the spread of S. aureus infections. Another study, conducted by Oliver et al. [9], agreed with the above findings supporting that cows in lactation period were a source of S. aureus infection; thus leading to increased cases of heifer mastitis (spread of the disease) in the absence of fly control programs in the farm.",

In our study, the total AUC regarding CNS intramammary infections revealed a lower shedding rate of these bacteria in cows of Group A than in cows of Group B. Mohammed et al. [29] reported 18.2% and 9.1% infection of Musca domestica and Stomoxys calcitrans, respectively, with CNS.

The major mean of transmission of this type of mastitis is thought to be Hydrotaea irritans, a blood sucking fly [12,51]. In cattle farms, high numbers of Hydrotaea irritans have been detected on the ventral abdomen and udder, and since the microorganisms involved in summer mastitis have been isolated from these flies, there is a strong evidence that these flies can transmit the disease. One survey, conducted in Sweden from 2002 to 2003, revealed the presence of Trueperella pyogenes in 64 out of 987 (6.1%) udder quarters milk samples [52], while this percentage was lower in New York State, reaching 1.0% for multiparous cows [53].

SCC is the number of white blood cells and epithelial cells, present in milk, as distinguished from invading bacterial cells [38]. Individual somatic cell count consists the best indicator to discriminate mastitis category, as SCC over 200.000 indicates subclinical mastitis [46]. In our study, the high numbers of SCC indicated severe intramammary infections of the cows. The application of deltamethrin reduced fly infestation, leading to lower shedding rate of the responsible bacteria for intramammary infections (e.g. S. aureus, CNS and E. coli) in milk samples. This reduced shedding resulted in lower number of SCCs in the same milk samples.",

At Day 30, the comparison of fly burden, in Group B and C, enhanced the possible explanations regarding the reduction of the mean fly population in untreated control group of cows (Group B) from Day 20 to 30. In addition, the mean numbers of S. aureus, CNS and E. coli intramammary infections and SCC in milk samples of Group C remained in high levels at the end of the study, something that was confirmed by the significant differences of the 20\u201330 AUC of these parameters. Therefore, the reduction of the mean fly burden as well as of the shedding rate of S. aureus, CNS, E. coli and SCC were largely attributed to the application of the fly repellent, deltamethrin.",
