Research use of mice has grown exponentially during the past and current century with the recognition of the power of the mouse for gene and comparative mapping and have made the laboratory mouse, in genetic terms, the most thoroughly characterized mammal on earth (Silver, 1995; Lyon et al., 1996; Morse, 2007a). The current ability to create highly sophisticated, genetically engineered mice by inserting transgenes or targeted mutations into endogenous genes has also made the laboratory mouse the most widely and heavily used experimental animal.",

            "text": "Historical reviews have documented the origins of the laboratory mouse, which extend thousands of years into antiquity (Keeler, 1931; Morse, 1978; Silver, 1995). The laboratory mouse belongs within the genus Mus, subfamily Murinae, family Muridae, superfamily Muroidea, Order Rodentia, and within the M. musculus clade collectively called the \u2018house mouse\u2019 (Lundrigan et al., 2002). Anatomic features of molar teeth and cranial bones were traditionally used by zoologists to identify over 100 different species within the genus, and to differentiate them from other murids. Because of considerable phenotypic variation within a single Mus species, this approach has proven to be inaccurate, and given way to contemporary genetic analysis. The native range of the genus Mus is Eurasia and North Africa. Members of this genus are generally classified as aboriginal, consisting of species that live independent of humans, or commensal, which includes taxa that have coevolved and geographically radiated with human civilization since the dawn of agriculture 12,000 years before present (bp). This close association with human agrarian society gave rise to the genus name, derived from Sanskrit, Mush: to steal. The commensal group is known as the \u2018house mouse\u2019 clade, consisting of several subspecies of Mus musculus, including M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus, M. m. castaneus, M. m. bactrianus, and a lesser known lineage, M. m. gentilulus (Prager et al., 1998). The Japanese house mouse, M. m. molossinus, is a natural hybrid of M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus. The progenitor of the M. musculus clade arose in the northern Indian subcontinent and diverged into genetically isolated and distinct species or subspecies due to geographic barriers (mountain ranges). There is debate whether these taxa are species or subspecies, and some have referred to them as \u2018incipient species,\u2019 but their genetic divergence is now blurring as they colonize the world and hybridize.",

It is now apparent that the M.m. musculus and M.m. castaneus contributions to the laboratory mouse genome were primarily derived from M.m. molossinus Japanese fancy mice (Takada et al., 2013). Mus m. domesticus is indigenous to western Europe and southwest Asia, M.m. musculus to eastern Europe and northern Asia, M.m. castaneus to southeast Asia, and M.m. molossinus to Japan and the Korean peninsula. The cohabitation of humans with commensal mice gave rise to captive breeding for coat color and behavioral variants in China over 3000 years bp. By the 1700s, mouse \u2018fanciers\u2019 in Asia had created many varieties of fancy mice, as did European fanciers, who subsequently acquired Asian stocks, particularly Japanese fancy mice (M.m. molossinus), to mix with European (M.m. domesticus) fancy mouse varieties. This genetic mixing for fancy variants was also occurring in the United States, and these mouse lines contributed to many of the major laboratory mice used today. Meanwhile, the European colonial expansion era contributed to the worldwide dissemination of M.m. domesticus, which now occupies every continent of the world. It is well documented that wild-caught M.m. domesticus also contributed to the genetic composition of fancy and laboratory mice on multiple occasions.",

Most inbred laboratory mice share a common maternal mitochondrial genome derived from M.m. domesticus (Ferris et al., 1982; Yu et al., 2009), and a common Y chromosome contributed by M.m. musculus (Bishop et al., 1985) through its contribution to the genome of M.m. molossinus (Nagamine et al., 1992). Thus, the most inclusive name that can be assigned to the genetically mosaic laboratory mouse is M. musculus, the over-arching name for the entire commensal clade. There are exceptions, however. C57BL/6 mice contain minor genetic elements derived from M. spretus (Hardies et al., 2000), and a number of wild aboriginal species that are not members of the M. musculus clade, including M. spretus, M. caroli, and others, have been established as inbred lines of mice.",

The first autosomal genes, albino and pink-eyed dilution, were linked in 1915 (Haldane et al., 1915). Extensive linkage maps and an impressive array of inbred strains are now available to expedite genetic research (Table 3.1) (Lyon et al., 1996). Mice have 20 pairs of telocentric chromosomes that are differentiated by their size and patterns of transverse bands. The chromosomes are designated by Arabic numbers in order of decreasing size. During the 1970s, chromosome rearrangements were used to assign known genetic linkage groups \u2013 identified by Roman numerals \u2013 to specific chromosomes and for determining locus order with respect to the centromere. Genes can be located physically on chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Development of quantitative trait loci (QTL) methodology for mapping genes and the similarity between mouse and human genomes have made the mouse invaluable for identifying genes and underlying complex traits that are inherent to the most common human genetic diseases (Moore and Nagle, 2000).

            "text": "One of the most thoroughly studied genetic systems of the mouse is the histocompatibility complex. Histocompatibility (H) loci control expression of cell surface molecules that modulate critical immune responses, such as the recognition of foreign tissue. For example, the time, onset, and speed of skin graft rejection are controlled by two groups of H loci. The major group is located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, H2) on chromosome 17. The H2 complex contains several loci, including K, D, L, I-A, and I-E. Inbred strains of mice, being homozygous, each have unique sets of H2 alleles, termed H2 haplotypes. For example, the BALB H2 haplotype is H2\nd and the C57BL H2 haplotype is H2\nb. The International ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) Information System provides details on H2 haplotypes for various inbred mice (www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoireMHC/Polymorphism/haplotypes/mouse/MHC/Mu_haplotypes.html). Minor H loci groups are scattered throughout the genome and are responsible for delayed graft rejection. Genes associated with the H2 complex also control other immunological functions, such as cell\u2013cell interactions in primary immune responses and the level of response to a given antigen. Immune-mediated responses to infectious agents such as viruses and complement activity are influenced directly or indirectly by the H2 complex (Stuart, 2010). Non-MHC or minor histocompatibility systems also are under active study (Roopenian et al., 2000).",

The Mouse Genomes Project/Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is extending this effort to include the genomic sequences of 17 key mouse strains. Completed and evolving sequence data are available through the European Nucleotide Archive (www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/home). The burgeoning numbers of inbred mouse strains, natural mutants, induced mutants, transgenic lines, and targeted mutant lines of mice are cataloged in the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database: http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome). The growing number of mutant mice has fostered the development of a number of mouse repositories, from which specific mice can be located and acquired. In the United States, there are four regional National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (http://www.mmrrc.org), which link to international repositories in Europe, Japan, China, Australia, and Canada, as well as additional resource programs in the United States through the International Mouse Strain Resource (IMSR; http://www.informatics.jax.org/imsr/index.jsp) for depositing, archiving, and distributing mutant mouse and embryonic stem cell lines to the scientific community. In addition to numerous mutant mice produced independently by scientists in various academic institutions, three major targeted gene knockout programs, all utilizing C57BL/6N embryonic stem cells, are under way internationally, and funded by the NIH, the European Community, and Genome Canada (Collins et al., 2007; Skarnes et al., 2011). These include the Knock Out Mouse Project (KOMP; http://www.knockoutmouse.org), the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program (EUCOMM; http://www.eucomm.org), and the North American Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Project (NorCOMM; http://norcomm.phenogenomics.ca/index.htm). These mouse lines will be available through three distribution centers: the German Resource Center for Genome Research (RZPD; http://www.rzpd.de), the KOMP repository (https://komp.org), and the Canadian Mouse Consortium (CMC; http://www.mousecanada.ca/index.htm). The repositories are all linked to the IMSR, and provide access to mice, germplasm, genomic detail, and phenotypic data. Genetic, genomic, and biological data are also available through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC; www.mousephenotype.org) and the Mouse Genome Database (MGD; http://www.informatics.jax.org) (Eppig et al., 2012).",

Mice within an inbred strain, for practical purposes, are genetically identical (syngeneic or isogenic) to other mice of the same strain and sex. Because of residual heterozygosity, a strain is not fully inbred until after 60 F generations. Most commonly used inbred mouse strains represent 200 or more F generations, providing a high degree of experimental reproducibility. The mouse genome is not static, so when branches of an inbred strain are separated, spontaneous mutations, residual heterozygosity, and retroelement integrations result in genetic differences. Therefore, if branches of an inbred strain are separated before F40, if branches have separated for 100 generations, or if genetic differences arise, the different branches become substrains. The same holds true if branches of a substrain diverge, resulting in substrains of the inbred substrain.",

RI mice are useful for mapping phenotypic or quantitative traits that differ between the progenitor strains (Bailey, 1971). RI sets are generally limited to two parental strains. An ongoing international effort has been undertaken to increase allelic diversity among RI strains by creating the Collaborative Cross (CC) in which a panel of RI strains are being generated mixing the genomes from eight disparately related inbred (octo-parental) mouse strains, including A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, nonobese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ. These eight strains capture nearly 90% of the known genetic variation present among laboratory mice.

Frequently, a mutation that arose in one inbred strain may be desired within the genetic background of another inbred strain. This can be accomplished by backcrossing, in which an F1 hybrid is created by mating the donor mutant strain to the desired background strain, with subsequent matings to the background strain while retaining the mutant locus. After 10 backcross generations (N generations), the mutant mouse line is now congenic to the background inbred strain. Backcrossing to create congenic strains of mice has been used extensively when targeted mutations have been induced in 129 embryonic stem cells, with backcrossing onto C57BL/6 inbred mice. Congenic mice are never co-isogenic, as the preserved locus in a congenic mouse is invariably surrounded by flanking DNA, which may significantly influence phenotype (Linder, 2006).\n",

Outbred mice are called stocks, which are defined as a closed population (for at least four generations) of genetically variable mice that are bred to maintain maximal heterozygosity. Outbred mice may be used when high genetic heterogeneity is desired or for experiments requiring large numbers of mice. Outbreeding can be achieved only in a large breeding population using a systematic breeding scheme, or randomized selection of breeders from the population. A small breeding population or passage through the genetic \u2018bottleneck\u2019 of rederivation to improve health status will reduce genetic heterogeneity and lead eventually to some degree of inbreeding. In a population of 25 breeding pairs, e.g., heterozygosity will decrease at 1% per generation with standard randomization techniques. Random breeding involves the statistically random selection of breeders by using a random numbers table or computer program. An outbreeding program that is easy to manage is the circular pair mating system, in which each pair is mated only once. Conceptually, cages are visualized in a circle, and each cage contains one breeding pair in the nth generation. Another \u2018circular\u2019 set of cages serves as the breeding nucleus for the n + 1 generation. Each mated pair in the nth generation contributes one female and one male to the n + 1 generation. Outbreeding is accomplished by assigning the female and male derived from each nth generation cage to different cages in the n + 1 generation.",

Although considered outbred, they have a high degree of homozygosity, exemplified by the fact that many Swiss mouse stocks are blind due to the homozygous recessive rd1 allele (Serfilippi et al., 2004b). It is preferable to ensure genetic heterogeneity by intercrossing multiple inbred strains to achieve heterogeneity with known genetic input.

HR is a less common repair pathway, but certain manipulations of the engineered nucleases can increase HR efficiency. For example, nucleases can be engineered to generate a break in a single strand of DNA rather than inducing DSB, and the resulting nickases increase the incidence of HR with high fidelity (Gaj et al., 2013; Wijshake et al., 2014). HR allows for the introduction of donor DNA to generate knock-ins, specific point mutations, or for the generation of larger modifications such as insertions of loxP sites (Brown et al., 2013; Wijshake et al., 2014).",

One advantage of EE technologies over more traditional transgenic methods is the ability to target DNA and induce mutations in any background strain of mouse negating the need to backcross onto the desired strain. Multiple genes can be targeted with CRISPRs simultaneously, thus avoiding the need to cross single knockout animals (Zhou et al., 2014). In addition, it is possible to obtain bi-allelic mutations in some cases, allowing for the generation of functional gene knockout animals in a single generation (Zhou et al., 2014; Wijshake et al., 2014). Vectors for generating EE are available through plasmid repositories; websites are available to assist in identifying appropriate DNA sequences to target; and multiple websites post protocols for generating the various types of engineered endonucleases (Xie et al., 2014; Sander et al., 2010; Bae et al., 2014; Reyon et al., 2011; Herscovitch et al., 2012; Wolfson, 2013).

            "text": "Inbred mouse strains are designated by a series of capital letters and/or numbers, which often provide a shorthand description of the origin and history of the strain. The C57BL/6J mouse serves as an example. The inbred strain C57BL originated from Abbie Lathrop\u2019s female 57 (and male 52) at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (C), and was the black (BL) line from this female. Early in their history, inbred C57BL mice split into major substrains, e.g., C57BL/6 and C57BL/10. Substrains are identified by appending a forward slash (/) after the inbred strain name. Since 1950, uniform international nomenclature has been built upon these historical names, so that substrains of an inbred strain are now designated using lab codes that are registered in the International Laboratory Code Registry maintained at the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) of the National Academies (dels.nas.edu/global/ilar/Lab-codes). Laboratory codes are composed of one to five letters that identify an institute, laboratory, or investigator. Each lab code starts with an uppercase letter, followed by lowercase letters if more than one letter is used (such as N, J, Jci, Crl, and Tac). The J in C57BL/6J means it is a substrain maintained at the Jackson Laboratory (J). Another common substrain of C57BL/6 mice is C57BL/6N, which is maintained at NIH (N). Substrains can be cumulative, reflecting the genetic history of the mouse strain. For example, there are a number of C57BL/6J substrains (such as C57BL/6JJci and C57BL/6JJmsSlc), and a number of C57BL/6N substrains (such as C57BL/6NJci, C57BL/6NCrlCrlj, and C57BL/6NTac). Significant differences may exist among these substrains (Mekada et al., 2009). Thus, a string of substrain designations indicate the genetic progression of the substrain, which can be identified when reading the entire strain name. This nomenclature is highly nuanced, as C57BL/6NCrlCrlj mice, whose last letter is a lowercase j, are not a substrain maintained at the Jackson Laboratory (J), but rather at Charles River Japan (Crlj), underscoring the importance of upper- and lowercase lettering in rodent nomenclature. BALB/c mice are another popular inbred strain with numerous substrains. Like the \u20186\u2019 in C57BL/6, the \u2018c\u2019 that follows the \u2018/\u2019 in BALB/c is a lowercase letter because of historical precedent. Subsequent substrains follow accepted nomenclature, e.g., BALB/cByJ and BALB/cAnN.",

When an F1 hybrid is created, the female partner is listed first, e.g., a C57BL/6J \u00d7 129S2/SvPas hybrid would be designated: C57BL/6J129S2/SvPasF1. RI strain sets that are derived from two parental inbred strains are identified by an X between the two parental strains followed by a hyphen designating the specific RI line, e.g., C57BL/6JXDBA/2J-1, C57BL/6JXDBA/2J-2, etc. CC RI strains do not use the X between the parental strains because they are derived from eight parental strains, so they are designated CC-1, CC-2, etc. In order to simplify the complexity of this nomenclature, abbreviations are used for common inbred strains and substrains of mice (Table 3.4), but it is important to include the full genetic nomenclature in publications. Using the abbreviated nomenclature, C57BL/6J129S2/SvPasF1 mice would be B6129F1 and C57BL/6JXDBA/2J-1 RI mice would be BXD-1. Parental order is an important consideration in nomenclature, as a B6129 mouse is genetically different from a 129B6 mouse due to mitochondrial DNA (from the female) and Y chromosome (from the male) differences.",

The emerging interest in the mouse microbiome in combination with the immune competency of diverse genetically engineered mouse strains demands high standards of mouse care. Mouse colonies are optimally maintained as specific-pathogen-free (SPF) which obligates veterinary and facility management to exclude specific organisms. Housing options for SPF immunocompetent mice typically include static or individually ventilated microisolator cages, which differ significantly in cost and labor required to maintain. Severely immunodeficient strains such as NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice require staff training, caging systems and husbandry practices that minimize risk for opportunistic infections (Foreman et al., 2011). Barrier practices and microisolator techniques may include autoclaved or irradiated feed and bedding, autoclaved or acidified water, cage-to-cage transfer of mice using disinfected forceps, positive displacement change hoods, and verified sanitation of caging and equipment through tunnel or rack washers to prevent fomite transmission of infectious agents (Compton et al., 2012). In addition to husbandry staff, it is critical to maintenance of colony health status that investigators who handle cages are also trained in these techniques.",

Vendors often successfully house production colonies in open-top cages to expedite detection of pathogen transmission should a break occur. End-users usually prefer filter-top microisolator cages which prevent (at least) gross contamination between cages by fecal contamination and aerosolized debris. The objective is to keep mice in an uncrowded, socially compatible, low-odor, dry and clean environment. Ambient temperature should minimize any confounding impact on the animal model and energy expenditure for the mice, while also being suitable for staff and investigators. Shoebox static cages made of polycarbonate, polypropylene, or polystyrene plastic (in order of decreasing cost and durability) with filtered microisolator tops continue to be used for housing and breeding mice. Older cage designs are being rapidly supplanted by individually ventilated caging systems that promote the advantages of increasing housing capacity, decreasing labor costs, and mitigating exposure of mice to noxious gases such as ammonia and exposure of humans to allergens. As more advanced caging systems are developed, the level of biosecurity may be increased but at the cost of increased health surveillance efforts to detect the source of an infectious outbreak (Shek, 2008). Disposable, recyclable polyethylene caging is a recent innovation, particularly for facilities not equipped with a cage wash facility.",

It may be preferable to irradiate or autoclave bedding, but if this is not done, the bedding should be used only after its origin and microbial content have been evaluated (Table 3.5\n). Germfree and gnotobiotic mice require positive pressure isolators, most usually flexible film, with additional protection provided by sterile air through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. This equipment can be negatively pressurized when the objective is to contain known or unknown pathogens.

For certain studies, it is desirable to colonize germfree mice with a defined microbiota. In the mid-1960s, Schaedler was the first to colonize germfree mice with selected bacteria isolated from normal mice (Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983). He subsequently supplied animal breeders with this group of microorganisms. These defined bacteria included aerobic bacteria and some less oxygen-sensitive anaerobic organisms. The so-called extremely oxygen-sensitive (EOS) fusiform bacteria, which make up the majority of the normal microbiota of rodents, were not included, because of technical difficulties in isolation and cultivation. Of the defined microbiotas later used for gnotobiotic studies, the one known as the \u2018Schaedler flora\u2019 was the most popular. In 1978, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) decided to revise the Schaedler flora, or \u2018cocktail\u2019 consisting of eight bacteria, in order to standardize the microbiota used to colonize germfree rodents. The new defined microbiota, now known as the \u2018altered Schaedler flora\u2019 (ASF), consisted of four members of the original Schaedler flora (two lactobacilli, Bacteroides distasonis, and the EOS fusiform bacterium), a spiral-shaped bacterium, and three new fusiform EOS bacteria. Studies have quantified the regional colonization of the ASF strains along the gastrointestinal tract (Sarma-Rupavtarm et al., 2004) (Fig. 3.4\n). Individual strain abundance was dependent on oxygen sensitivity, with microaerotolerant Lactobacillus murinus ASF361 present at 105\u2013107 cells/g of tissue in the upper gastrointestinal tract and obligate anaerobic ASF strains being predominant in the cecal and colonic flora at 108\u20131010 cells/g of tissue.",

It is necessary to demonstrate that microorganisms of the specified microbiota are present and that adventitious microorganisms are absent. In the past, monitoring relied on bacterial morphology, limited evaluation of biochemical traits, and growth characteristics. With the advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, the eight ASF strains were identified taxonomically by 16S rRNA sequence analysis (Dewhirst et al., 1999). Three strains were previously identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain ASF 360), L. salivarius (strain ASF 361), and Bacteroides distasonis (strain ASF 519), based on phenotypic criteria. 16S rRNA analysis and genome sequencing indicated that each of the strains differed from its presumptive identity (Wannemuehler et al., 2014). The 16S rRNA sequence of strain ASF 361 is essentially identical to the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of L. murinus and L. animalis (both isolated from mice), and all of these strains probably belong to a single species. Strain ASF 360 is a novel lactobacillus that clusters with L. acidophilus and L. lactis. Strain ASF 519 is a Parabacteroides sp. The spiral-shaped strain, strain ASF 457, is in the Flexistipes phylum, exhibits sequence identity with rodent isolates of Robertson, and has been formally named, Mucispirillum schaedleri (Robertson et al., 2005). The remaining four ASF strains, which are EOS fusiform bacteria, group phylogenetically with the low-G + C content gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes, Bacillus-Clostridium group) (ASF 492 \u2013 Eubacterium plexicaudatium; ASF 500 \u2013 Firmicutes bacterium; ASF 502 and ASF 356 \u2013 Clostridium sp.) (Fig. 3.5\n). The 16S rRNA sequence information was determined by Dewhirst et al. (1999) and draft genome sequences for each member of ASF were recently published (Wannemuehler et al., 2014). This genetic data will permit detailed analysis of the interactions of ASF organisms during development of intestinal disease in mice that are coinfected with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms.",

The cortex is divided into B lymphocyte domains, called primary follicles, and T lymphocyte domains, known as the diffuse cortex. The mouse does not have palatine or pharyngeal tonsils. The spleen lies adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach. Different strains of mice have varying degrees of accessory splenic tissue. Age, strain, sex, and health status can affect the size, shape, and appearance of the spleen. Male spleens, e.g., may be 50% larger than those of females. Most lymphocytes enter and leave the spleen in the bloodstream. The so-called white pulp of the spleen is organized along the central arteriole and is subdivided into T- and B-cell zones. The periarteriolar sheath is composed mainly of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and lymph follicles, which often contain germinal centers, are located at the periphery. The red pulp consists of sinusoids and hemoreticular tissue. Cellular and humoral components of immunity are distributed to the bloodstream and tissues by efferent lymphatic vessels and lymphatic ducts, which empty into the venous system.",

Thymectomy in adult mice produces no immediate effect, but several months later mice may develop a progressive decline of circulating lymphocytes and impaired cellular immune responses.

The deme is composed of a dominant breeding male, a hierarchy of females, subordinate males, and juveniles. Wild mice occupy territories measuring just a few square meters when food is abundant to several square kilometers. Mice are crepuscular (active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk), strongly territorial, and omnivorous. Coprophagy contributes to approximately one-third of their ingesta as an essential nutritional activity. Aside from territoriality, social interactions, breeding, burrowing (when conducive substrates are available), and nest building are major activities. In managing laboratory mice, it is important to understand the complex behavioral biology of their free-living counterparts (Latham and Mason, 2004).",

They are synthesized in the liver and excreted in the urine, as well as nasal mucosa, lacrimal glands, and salivary glands. Their endogenous role on metabolic activity is not yet understood. Male mice excrete significantly more Mups in the urine than females. One well-characterized Mup is \u2018darcin\u2019, named after Fitzwilliam Darcy, the romantic hero in Pride and Prejudice. As its name implies, it is a female attractant. Mups also act as kairomones, which function as chemical signals between species. For example, cat and rat Mups invoke fear in mice. Mups are important in the laboratory animal management context, as they are excreted in copious amounts (1\u20135 mg/ml in urine) and are potent allergens for humans, particularly Mus m 1 (Ag1 or MA1), which is encoded by the Mup 17 gene (Sharrow et al., 2001).",

The continued presence of the original mate protects the female from this effect (Bruce, 1959). The Vandenbergh effect results in acceleration of puberty of juvenile females in response to male urine (Vandenbergh, 1973). The Lee\u2013Boot effect occurs among group-housed females that are isolated from males, in which there is suppression of estrus cyclicity (Van Der Lee and Boot, 1955). The Whitten effect results in synchronization of estrus among a group of females in response to a male (Whitten et al., 1968). The Lee\u2013Boot and Whitten effects are utilized in the laboratory to assist in induction of synchronized timed pregnancy, but the Bruce effect can have deleterious consequences on breeding colonies when foreign males are introduced to a breeding colony, as pheromone communication can occur in the absence of direct contact.",

It is clear that this rich complexity cannot be fully addressed under laboratory conditions, but that does not mean that basic needs, such as nest building, burrowing, foraging, and olfactory environments, cannot be provided. For example, intermale aggression, which is particularly apparent in some strains of mice such as BALB/c and Swiss-origin stocks and strains, can be minimized by maintaining males from infancy as sibling groups, since adult siblings tend not be aggressive to one another. This sibling bond, however, can be easily broken by short-term separation. Environmental enrichment often features provision of plastic houses, which may make vivarium managers feel good, but maximal enrichment can be provided by provision of nesting material, which includes structural scaffolding, such as crinkled cardboard, which facilitates construction of three-dimensional nests. Mouse nests are replete with \u2018appeasement\u2019 pheromones, thereby contributing to harmony within the cage, whereas introduction of dirty bedding has the opposite effect. Frequent cage changing, including removal of established nests, is highly stressful and disruptive to social harmony within a cage. Provision of appropriate and adequate amounts of bedding material that is conducive to burrowing is desirable. It is important to remember that mice are socially gregarious, and that mouse welfare is optimally enriched by other mice within a socially harmonious deme (Latham and Mason, 2004; Van Loo et al., 2003).",

B cells of the B-1 lineage and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are regarded as innate-like cells, as they express a rearranged antigen receptor but seem to respond in an innate-like manner.",

For example, T cells are differentiated into two subsets based on their expression of either CD4 or CD8. CD4+ T cells (T helper cells) recognize peptides presented in MHC class II and promote B-lymphocyte activation and activate and regulate cellular immune responses via secretion of differing cytokines (see below). CD8+ T cells recognize antigenic peptides presented in MHC class I and serve as cytotoxic cells during the cell-mediated immune response where they can destroy infected cells (e.g., against cells containing infectious agents).",

Five classes or Ig \u2018isotypes\u2019 can be distinguished, which differ in effector function: IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgD. The latter is expressed only on the surface of B cells in mice. The IgG class, the most abundant antibody class in the serum, is further divided into subtypes: IgG1, IgG2a/c, IgG2b, and IgG3. Polymorphisms exist on the Ig locus such that some strains of mice produce the IgG2a subtype (e.g., BALB/c), whereas others produce IgG2c (e.g., C57BL/6) (Zhang et al., 2012). Additional allelic polymorphisms of the locus also exist. For example, BALB/c and 129SV mice express the Igh-a allotype, whereas C57BL/6 mice express the Igh-b allotype. Recombinant inbred strains of mice exist for both BALB/c and C57BL/6, which harbor the reciprocal Igh locus (i.e., Igh-b for BALB/c and Igh-a for C57BL/6 mice). These mice are useful tools for tracking B cells following adaptive cell transfer via allotype-specific mAb (see below).",

Immune effector responses differ depending on the life cycle (facultative or obligate intracellular, extracellular, localized, systemic, etc.) and antigen types displayed by the encountered antigen/pathogen, because this affects the type of PRR engaged and activated. PRR engagement leads to cytokine and chemokine responses by the first responders, i.e., epithelial cells, local macrophage populations and other innate cells. The type of cytokines and chemokines produced then dictates the types of cells recruited to the site of infection and their subsequent differentiation and functions. The PRR engagement also leads to antigen uptake, activation and migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from the site of insult to the regional lymph nodes, where DCs present antigen peptides on MHC molecules to T cells. In addition, the DCs secrete cytokines induced by the initial PRR activation, which cause the differentiation of CD4 T cells towards a particular effector response. For example, secretion of IL-12 in response to activation of TLR2 or 4 will result in the induction of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production by CD4 T cells, whereas IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 production by DC will induce CD4 T cells to secrete IL-17 (Kara et al., 2014). Because the DC translates signals from PRR at the site of infection into differentiation signals for T cells in the lymph tissues, these cells are regarded as a \u2018bridge\u2019 between the innate and adaptive immune systems.",

Surveillance should encompass resident mice and mouse products (serum, cell lines, transplantable tumors) procured from external sources. Because surveillance strategies will vary with research needs and operating conditions, it is prudent to consult a number of sources, such as the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) (Nicklas et al., 2002) and commercial laboratories, for guidance. Detailed discussion of microbial quality control is provided in Chapter 10. There are also recommendations regarding specific agents in following sections. Diagnostic methods involve gross and microscopic pathology, parasitology, microbial isolation and culture, serology, and PCR. Serology is particularly important for viral surveillance, and now relies principally on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex fluorescent immunoassay (MFI) for simultaneous detection of antibodies to multiple agents (Hsu et al., 2007), indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, or hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), with the latter two methods generally used for confirmation (Livingston and Riley, 2003; Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009).

The original isolate of ECTV, known as the Hampstead strain, was discovered by J. Marchal in 1930 (Marchal, 1930) as the cause of epizootic disease among laboratory mice in England. The disease featured amputation of extremities, which Marchal termed ectromelia (from the Greek, ectro, amputation and melia, limb). Other strains of the virus include Moscow, NIH-79, Washington University, St. Louis 69, Beijing 70, Ishibahsi I\u2013III, and Naval (NAV) strains, which vary in virulence, but are essentially indistinguishable genetically and serologically, suggesting a common origin. Virus can be isolated from infected tissues by inoculation of cell cultures (BS-C-1, HeLa, L cells) or embryonated eggs. The natural host (and original source of infection of laboratory mice) of ECTV remains unknown.",

During natural epizootics, it was observed that A, BC, DBA/1, DBA/2, and CBA strains developed acute fatal infections, whereas C57BL/6 mice were resistant to severe disease (Briody, 1966). Experimental studies have shown that all strains of mice are susceptible to infection, but BALB/c, A, DBA/2, and C3H/He mice were highly susceptible, AKR and SJL mice were moderately susceptible, and C57BL/6 mice were highly resistant to lethal infection (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987c; Wallace and Buller, 1985). The mechanisms of genetic resistance are not fully understood but appear to reflect multiple genes, some of which appear to be expressed through lymphoreticular cells, including NK cells (Brownstein et al., 1991a; Jacoby et al., 1989). The nuances of cytokine and cellular immune responses to ECTV infection have received recent attention (reviewed in Buller and Fenner (2007) and Esteban and Buller (2005)). Outbreaks among susceptible mice are often volatile, with variable morbidity and high mortality in susceptible strains of mice. Clinical signs such as ruffled fur or prostration may occur for only a few hours before death. Mice that survive acute infection may develop chronic disease characterized by a focal or generalized rash anywhere on the body (Fig. 3.12\n). Conjunctivitis also may occur. Skin lesions usually recede within several weeks, but hairless scars may remain. Additionally, severe viral infection of the feet and tail during the rash syndrome can lead to necrosis and amputation.",

Natural exposure is thought to occur through direct contact and skin abrasions. Cage-to-cage transmission is low and can be virtually nil if filter-topped cages are used (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987b). Ectromelia virus is highly stable at room temperature, especially under dry conditions, leading to the potential for prolonged environmental contamination in infected colonies (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987d). Aerogenic exposure is not a major factor in natural outbreaks, and arthropod-borne transmission does not appear to occur. Virus-free progeny can be obtained from immune dams (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987b). However, intrauterine infection and fetal deaths, albeit rare, have been reported.",

The risks for transmission are further increased by persistence of infectious virus in excreta and exfoliated scabs. Although virus excretion typically lasts for about 3 weeks, virus has been found in scabs and/or feces for up to 16 weeks. Resistant mouse strains also are dangerous because they can shed virus during subclinical infections. However, infections in resistant mice tend to be short-lived. Highly susceptible mice are a relatively small hazard for dissemination of infection, if properly discarded, because they die before virus shedding becomes prominent. Thus, juxtaposition of resistant or intermediately resistant infected mice with highly susceptible mice can provoke explosive outbreaks. Infant and aged mice are usually more susceptible to lethal infection than young adult mice. Maternal immunity among enzootically infected breeding mice may perpetuate infection by protecting young mice from death, but not from infection. Such mice may subsequently transmit infection by contact exposure.",

It is found primarily in epithelial cells of skin (Fig. 3.14\n) or mucous membranes and can also be found in intestinal mucosa. The B type of inclusion is basophilic and can be found in all ectromelia-infected cells. However, it is difficult to visualize unless cells are stained intensely with hematoxylin.

MPV was initially isolated following its detection as a lymphocytotropic contaminant in in vitro assays for cellular immunity. The virus grew lytically in a CD8+ T-cell clone designated L3 and inhibited the proliferation of cloned T cells stimulated with antigen or interleukin 2 (IL-2) (Mckisic et al., 1993). Molecular analysis of MPV indicates that regions encoding the NS proteins are similar to those of MVM (and other rodent parvoviruses). However, they differ significantly in regions encoding the capsid proteins, accounting for their antigenic specificity. The prototype isolate was first called an \u2018orphan\u2019 parvovirus of mice because its biology and significance were obscure, but it has subsequently been named mouse parvovirus (MPV). Immortalized T cells (L3) are the only cells found thus far to support replication of MPV. There are three genetically distinct variants of MPV, including MPV-1, MPV-2, and MPV-3. MPV-1 includes a number of closely related variants, including MPV-1a, MPV-1b, and MPV-1c. In addition, a hamster parvovirus isolate is closely related to MPV-3, which is infectious to mice and likely to be of mouse origin (Besselsen et al., 2006; Christie et al., 2010).",

Experimental studies following inoculation of neonatal BALB/c and C.B-17-Prkdc\nscid (SCID) mice revealed that BALB/c mice shed high levels of virus for 3 weeks, with transmission to sentinels exposed during the first 2 weeks of infection. Thereafter, BALB/c mice shed extremely low virus intermittently. In contrast, SCID mice shed high levels of virus until weaning, but lower levels at 6 weeks of age, yet they effectively transmitted infection to sentinels at all stages of infection (Besselsen et al., 2007). Others have shown that transmission of MPV by Sencar mice inoculated as infants was intermittent up to 6 weeks, whereas transmission by mice inoculated as weanlings occurred during the first 2 weeks of infection (Smith et al., 1993). Transmission to BALB/c progeny from infected dams was shown to occur, but embryo transfer rederivation was found to be successful in experimentally infected SCID mice (Besselsen et al., 2008).

Prevention is based on sound serological monitoring of mice and surveillance of biologicals destined for inoculation of mice.

The elevation of enzyme levels in blood is thought to result primarily from viral interference with clearance functions of the reticuloendothelial system.

Virus also escapes immune clearance by evolution of neutralizing antibody-resistant quasi-species. No lesions are seen in naturally infected mice. The only significant lesion that can arise from experimental infection is poliomyelitis. This syndrome requires a combination of immunosuppression (due to age, genetics or induced means), mouse strain (C58, AKR, C3H/Fg, and PL), neurotropic LDV strains, and endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus. The mouse strain-dependent element is homozygosity for the Fv-1\nn allele, which permits replication of endogenous N-tropic ectotropic murine leukemia virus. Mice develop spongiosis, neuronal necrosis, and astrocytosis of the ventral spinal cord and brain stem, with axonal degeneration of ventral roots. Lesions contain both LDV and retrovirus. Although this syndrome is largely experimentally induced, a natural outbreak of poliomyelitis has been reported in Fv-1 homozygous ICR-scid mice following inoculation with contaminated biologic material (Carlson-Scholz et al., 2011).",

Infection is usually introduced through inoculation of virus-infected biologicals, such as transplantable tumors, or by feral mice. Wild mice are a natural reservoir of infection and a potential threat to research colonies if they gain entry inadvertently. Naturally infected carrier mice can have persistently high concentrations of virus in many organs, thereby facilitating virus excretion in saliva, nasal secretions, and urine. Persistently infected neonates usually reach breeding age and can perpetuate infection in a breeding colony. Thus introduction of a single LCMV carrier mouse to a breeding colony can eventually result in a high prevalence of persistently infected mice. Infection in adult mice, in contrast, is often acute because of the onset of effective immunity, and the spread of virus is halted. Horizontal spread of infection is enhanced by close contact, but rapid horizontal spread is not characteristic. Mice can transmit LCMV to hamsters, which can remain viremic and viruric for many months, even if they contract infection as adults.

Intracerebral inoculation of virus into immunocompetent adult mice induces nonsuppurative leptomeningitis, choroiditis, and focal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. Host tissues are damaged during the course of the cellular immune response to the virus. The character of visceral lesions depends on virus strain and mouse strain; the ratio of cytolytic to proliferative responses in lymphoid organs is mouse strain-dependent. In severe infection, nonsuppurative inflammation can occur in many tissues. The severity of accompanying cytolytic lesions seems to parallel the intensity of cellular immunity. Liver lesions can include hepatocyte necrosis accompanied by nodular infiltrates of lymphoid cells and Kupffer cells, activated sinusoidal endothelium, an occasional granulocyte or megakaryocyte, and fatty metamorphosis. Cytolysis, cell proliferation, and fibrinoid necrosis can develop in lymphoid organs. Necrosis of cortical thymocytes can lead to thymic involution. Lesions of late-onset disease are characterized by formation of immune complexes and associated inflammation. Renal glomeruli and the choroid plexus are most severely affected, but complexes may also be trapped in synovial membranes, blood vessel walls, and skin. Lymphoid nodules can form in various organs.

Thus, elimination of virus and virus-associated immunological injury are both T-cell-mediated. This apparent paradox has been explained by the view that prompt cellular immunity limits viral replication and leads to host survival, whereas slower cellular immune responses permit viral spread and increase the number of virus-infected target cells subject to attack once immunity is fully developed. Antibody can be detected by 1 week after infection but does not play a significant role in eliciting acute disease.

A traditional method for detection involved collection of small blood samples from persistently infected live suspects, which are often viremic, and using them to inoculate cultured cells or adult and neonatal mice. Intracerebral inoculation of LCMV-positive tissues should elicit neurological signs in adult mice within 10 days, whereas infant mice should remain subclinical. Histological examination of brains from affected adults may reveal nonsuppurative inflammation, but lesions may be minimal in mice infected with viscerotropic isolates. Immunohistochemistry can be used to detect viral antigen in brains of suckling and adult mice. Intraperitoneal inoculation of adult mice may yield short-lived infection with seroconversion, i.e., the MAP test. Virus can be grown and quantified in several continuous cell lines, including mouse neuroblastoma (N-18) cells, BHK-21 cells, and L cells. Application of immunofluorescence staining to detect LCMV antigen in inoculated cultured cells yields results more quickly than animal inoculation. Of course, all diagnostic procedures involving potential contact with live virus should be carried out under strict containment conditions to avoid infection of laboratory personnel (see Chapter 29).

Susceptible mice usually have significant bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia, whereas the interstitial component may be less prominent in resistant mice. Typical changes begin with inflammatory edema of bronchiolar lamina propria, which may extend to alveolar ducts, alveoli, and perivascular spaces. Necrosis and exfoliation of bronchiolar epithelium ensue, frequently in a segmental pattern (Fig. 3.22\n). Alveolar epithelium also may desquamate, especially in severe disease, and necrotic cell debris and inflammatory cells can accumulate in airways and alveolar spaces. Alveolar septae are usually infiltrated by leukocytes to produce interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 3.23\n). Lymphoid cells also invade peribronchiolar and perivascular spaces. The lymphocytic response to SV infection reflects the fact that cellular immunity contributes both to lesions and to recovery. Local immunoglobulin synthesis by infiltrating cells also occurs. The extent of inflammatory cell infiltration corresponds to the level of genetic resistance expressed by the infected host, with clinically susceptible hosts mounting a more florid immune response than resistant hosts. Additionally, strain-related differences in the severity of infection may reflect differences in airway mucociliary transport. Multinucleated syncytia are occasionally seen in affected sucklings and SCID mice, and inclusion bodies have been reported in infected athymic mice.",

Humoral and cellular immunity participate in host defenses to infection, and T-cell-dependent immunity is an absolute requirement. Thus, age-related resistance to MHV correlates with maturation of lymphoreticular tissues, but intestinal proliferative kinetics are critical determinants of disease susceptibility with enterotropic MHV. Enzootic infection had been construed to include persistent infection in individual mice. Current evidence suggests, however, that enzootic infection results either from the fresh and continuous introduction of immunologically naive or deficient mice or from the recurrent infection of immune mice with MHV variants that arise by natural mutation. Mutation is favored by immune pressure in enzootically infected colonies as well as missteps during natural replication, which include copying errors and recombination. Thus, mice that have developed immunity to one strain of MHV can remain susceptible to one or more genetically and antigenically divergent strains, resulting in reinfection. This caveat has practical importance for breeding colonies. Maternal immunity protects suckling mice against homologous MHV strains but not against antigenically variant strains. However, maternal immunity, even to homologous strains, depends on the presence of maternally acquired antibody in the lumen of the intestine. Therefore, the susceptibility of young mice to infection increases significantly at weaning.",

Thus, viremia leads to secondary infection of vascular endothelium and parenchymal tissues in multiple organs including liver, brain, lymphoid organs, and other sites. Mice also may develop central nervous system disease by direct extension of infection from the olfactory mucosa along olfactory tracts. At necropsy, yellow\u2013white foci indicative of necrosis can occur in multiple tissues, with the involvement of the liver as the classical lesion. Liver involvement may be accompanied by icterus and peritonitis. Histologically, necrosis can be focal or confluent and may be infiltrated by inflammatory cells (Fig. 3.28\n). Syncytia commonly form at the margin of necrotic areas and, in mild infections, may develop in the absence of frank necrosis. Syncytia formation is a hallmark of infection in many tissues, including the intestine (Fig. 3.26), lung, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, brain, and bone marrow and in vascular endothelium in general. Although syncytia are transient in immunocompetent mice, they are a persistent feature in chronically infected, immunodeficient mice (Fig. 3.29\n). Neurotropic variants cause acute necrotizing encephalitis or meningoencephalitis in suckling mice, with demyelination in the brain stem and in peri-ependymal areas secondary to viral invasion of oligodendroglia. Convalescent mice may have residual mononuclear cell infiltrates around vessels or as focal lesions in the liver.

Pathogenic strains can cause lesions ranging from villus attenuation to fulminant necrotizing enterotyphlocolitis, which can kill suckling mice within a few days (Fig. 3.27). The stomach is often empty, and the intestine is filled with watery to mucoid yellowish, sometimes gaseous contents.

Enterocytes may contain intracytoplasmic inclusions, but they are not diagnostic. Surviving mice develop compensatory mucosal hyperplasia, which eventually recedes, but may contribute to clinical signs due to osmotic, secretory, and malabsorptive diarrhea. Older mice are equally susceptible to infection, but are resistant to severe disease due to their mature (more rapid) intestinal proliferative kinetics. Pathology may be subtle, consisting of transient syncytia without necrotic lesions. In adult mice, syncytia can be found most often in the surface mucosal epithelium of the ascending colon.

This strategy should attempt to select mice that are in early stages of infection, because necrosis in infant mice or seroconversion in older mice may reduce the chances of detecting syncytia or viral antigens. The option of using immunodeficient mice as sentinels can be considered, because they sustain prolonged infection. However, they should be securely confined because they also amplify virus loads. If properly controlled, amplification in immunodeficient mice can, however, facilitate subsequent virus isolation in tissue culture.",

Perhaps the most important factor is the duration of infection in individual mice and in mouse colonies. There is evidence that infection in an individual immunocompetent mouse is acute and self-limiting. Such mice can be expected to develop immunity and eliminate virus within 30 days. Therefore, selective quarantine at the cage (not room) level with the temporary cessation of breeding can be used effectively to eliminate infection. Quarantine at the room basis is likely to fail, since mutations arise and continually reinfect the mouse population. Additionally, maternally derived immunity can protect infant mice from infection until they are weaned and moved to uncontaminated quarters. Careful testing with sentinel mice should be used to assess the effectiveness of quarantine or \u2018natural rederivation,\u2019 as just described. Immunodeficient mice, in contrast, are susceptible to chronic infection and viral excretion. Mice with unrecognized or unanticipated immune dysfunction or with selective immune dysfunction may impact on MHV infection and its control. Such colonies, which may contain highly valuable or irreplaceable mice, may be rescued by cesarean rederivation or embryo transfer if vertical transmission of MHV infection is subsequently ruled out. Although rodent coronaviruses are not viable for extended periods in the environment, excreted virus may remain infectious for up to several days, so proper sanitation and disinfection of caging and animal quarters as well as stringent personal sanitation are essential to eliminate infection.",

For example, apart from its clinical impact, MHV may stimulate or suppress immune responses, contaminate transplantable neoplasms, and be reactivated by treatment of subclinically infected animals with several classes of drugs, including immunosuppressive agents, and by intercurrent infections. It also can alter tissue enzyme levels. Additionally, the ubiquitous threat of MHV infection and uncertainty about its potential effects on a given research project provoke concerns that may exceed its true impact. For example, transient infection with a mild enterotropic strain is unlikely to disrupt systemic immune responses, whereas infection with a polytropic strain may be highly disruptive. This is not to say that subclinical or strictly enterotropic infection should be taken lightly but simply to caution against overreaction in assessing the impact of an outbreak.",

EMCV has a less selective host range and can infect wild mice, but is not known to infect laboratory mice.

It can be cultivated in vitro in several continuous cell lines, but BHK-21 cells are routinely used for isolation and propagation. TMEV is antigenically related to EMCV.

            "text": "Hantaviruses are RNA viruses belonging to the very large Bunyaviridae family. They differ from other members of this family by not being arthropod-borne. Each hantavirus is antigenically distinct and maintained within single or at most a few rodent or insectivore hosts, but are infectious for other hosts. Infection is lifelong, and virus is transmitted by shedding of virus in urine, feces, and saliva. Several hantaviruses are zoonotic and may cause severe disease in humans. Although there is overlap, hantaviruses in Asia and Europe cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans, a multisystem disease with significant renal involvement, and hantaviruses that are endemic in the Americas cause\nhantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans, which is a multisystem disease with pulmonary involvement. Among the better-known Old World HFRS hantaviruses are Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, and Dobrava\u2013Belgrade viruses. Sin Nombre virus is the best known New World PHS hantavirus, among many others. Most notably from the perspective of laboratory animal medicine, the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus, serves as a reservoir host for hantavirus in the wild, but infection has also been associated with laboratory rats. In addition to being endemic in wild rats in Asia, it has been found to be endemic in wild rats in the eastern United States and associated with human cases of HFRS (Childs et al., 1988; Leduc et al., 1984; Tsai et al., 1985). Over 120 cases of hantavirus infection have been transmitted to humans from laboratory rats in Japan, Belgium, and the United Kingdom (Desmyter et al., 1983; Kawamata et al., 1987; Lloyd et al., 1984; Umenai et al., 1979). M. musculus is not considered to be a primary reservoir host, but hantavirus infection has been documented serologically in conventional and barrier-maintained laboratory mice and rats in Korea (Won et al., 2006), infection of wild M. musculus has been documented in the United States (Baek et al., 1988), and infection of wild mice in Europe has been associated with human exposure (Diglisic et al., 1994). Hantaviruses are difficult to culture in vitro. Infection in rodents is subclinical and is detected by serology or RT-PCR. The main research complication from natural infection is the zoonotic risk and potentially subclinical effects on the immune response associated with viral defenses such as CD8+ T cell (Taruishi et al., 2007) and NK function as demonstrated in human studies (Braun et al., 2014).",

MLV is associated with lymphomas, the pattern of which is mouse strain specific. For example, AKR mice develop 100% prevalence of thymic lymphoma between 6 and 12 months of age, whereas aging BALB/c mice commonly develop multicentric lymphoma. In these strains of mice, multiple endogenous MLVs are coexpressed in tissues and undergo recombination events that allow them to target and transform cells into neoplasia.

Therefore samples for culture and PCR of the upper respiratory tract should be obtained to confirm diagnosis. Buffered saline or Mycoplasma broth should be used to lavage the trachea, larynx, pharynx, and nasal passages. Specimens for culture from the genital tract are warranted if this site is suspected. Mycoplasma spp. may be difficult to grow, so it is prudent to confirm that the relevant expertise and quality control exist in the diagnostic laboratory. Speciation can be accomplished by immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase staining or by growth inhibition. Immunohistochemistry should be considered to supplement basic histopathologic examination. Immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques are available to identify mycoplasma antigens in tissue sections or in cytological preparations of tracheobronchial or genital tract lavages (Brunnert et al., 1994).

Characteristic clinical signs include spasmodic hyperextension of the head and the raising of one foreleg followed by intermittent rolling on the long axis of the body. The rolling becomes more constant, but mice occasionally leap or move rapidly. After 1\u20132 h of rolling, animals become comatose and usually die within 4 h. All published reports of rolling disease are associated with experimental inoculation of M. neurolyticum or exotoxin. Large numbers of organisms are needed to produce disease, and there is no indication that, under natural conditions, organisms replicate in the brain to concentrations required for the induction of these signs. Because animals are frequently inoculated with biological materials by parenteral routes, contamination with M. neurolyticum may induce rolling disease inadvertently. Diagnosis can be made from the appearance of typical clinical signs, astrocytic swelling, and isolation of the causative organism. Clinical signs must be differentiated from rolling associated with Pseudomonas- and P. pneumotropica-caused otitis. M. pulmonis has been recovered from the brain of mice but does not seem to cause overt neurological disease.",

It is characterized by angiocentric nonsuppurative hepatitis and hepatic necrosis (Fig. 3.43\n). Inflammation originates in portal triads and spreads to adjacent hepatic parenchyma. Hepatic necrosis also may occur adjacent to intralobular venules, which can contain microthrombi. Additionally, phlebitis may affect central veins. This lesion has been linked to the presence of organisms in bile canaliculi by silver stains and electron microscopy. Age-related hepatocytic proliferation can develop in infected livers, a response that is more pronounced in male mice than in female mice (Fox et al., 1996a). This lesion may increase susceptibility to hepatomas and hepatocellular carcinomas among aged male A/JCr and B6C3F1 mice from infected colonies. An increased incidence of hepatic hemangiosarcoma also has been noted in H. hepaticus-infected male B6C3F1 mice. In this context, A/JCr, C3H/HeNCr, and SJL/NCr mice are susceptible to hepatitis, whereas C57BL/6 mice are resistant (Ward et al., 1994). The finding of severe liver disease and tumor induction in B6C3F1 mice infected with H. hepaticus infers that genetic susceptibility to H. hepaticus-induced neoplasia has a dominant pattern of inheritance. Studies with H. hepaticus in recombinant inbred mice also indicate that disease susceptibility has multigenetic properties (Hailey et al., 1998; Fox and Lee, 1997; Ihrig et al., 1999; Franklin, 2006; Hillhouse et al., 2011).",

However, genus-specific PCR does not differentiate among different Helicobacter spp. Molecular speciation can be accomplished by 16S rRNA sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the PCR product or use of species-specific PCR assays. This procedure requires suitable skill and experience to avoid technological pitfalls and should be performed by qualified laboratories. An IgG ELISA using the outer membrane protein as the antigen has been proposed for serological diagnosis, but shared antigens among EHS create lack of specificity for the assay. As noted above, helicobacters can be isolated on antibiotic-impregnated blood agar under microaerobic conditions and can then be speciated biochemically, and by Helicobacter species-specific PCR. Isolation of H. hepaticus and from other Helicobacter spp. with spiral to curved morphology from feces should be preceded by passing slurried samples through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter before plating. If infection with larger fusiform helicobacters (H. bilis, H. rappini) is suspected, filtration at 0.65 \u03bcm is preferred. Helicobacters grow slowly and require prolonged incubation of cultures (up to 3 weeks) before they can be deemed negative. Signs (rectal prolapse) and lesions (hepatitis, typhlocolitis), depending on host genotype, can be suggestive of infection. Histopathological examination should include silver stains, especially of liver, to attempt to visualize spiral or curved organisms (Whary and Fox, 2004).",

The best results have been obtained by triple therapy with amoxicillin, metronidazole, and bismuth given for 2 weeks (Del Carmen Martino-Cardona et al., 2010). This strategy requires repeated daily gavage rather than administration in drinking water, but it has successfully eliminated H. hepaticus from naturally infected mice. Antibiotic impregnated wafers have been used to eradicate Helicobacter spp. in mouse colonies (Kerton and Warden, 2006). Wide-scale, eradication of enzootic helicobacteriosis can be expensive and time-consuming, without guarantee of success. Careful husbandry procedures can limit infection within a colony (Whary et al., 2000). Therefore, strategies have to be weighed carefully against risks of enzootic infection for the health and use of mice. In contrast, infection should be avoided in immunodeficient mice, including genetically engineered mice with targeted or serendipitous immune dysfunction. Lastly, the outcome of opportunistic helicobacteriosis has not been thoroughly examined. This condition could occur during simultaneous infection with two or more Helicobacter species or during combined infection with an intestinal virus (e.g., coronavirus) and Helicobacter spp. If highly valuable animals are exposed, antibiotic therapy or rederivation may be warranted.",

Eczematous dermatitis develops primarily on the face, ears, neck, shoulders, and forelegs and can progress to ulcerative dermatitis, abscessation (including botryomycotic granulomas), and cellulitis. Because lesions are often pruritic, scratching causes additional trauma and autoinoculation. Staphylococcal infection in the genital mucosa of males may produce preputial gland abscesses. These occur as firm, raised nodules in the inguinal region or at the base of the penis and may rupture to spread infection to surrounding tissues. Male mice also may develop septic balanoposthitis secondary to penile self-mutilation. Retrobulbar abscesses caused by S. aureus are frequently noted in athymic mice.

Age may also influence susceptibility, with young mice being more susceptible than adults. Immunodeficient mice (e.g., athymic mice) contaminated with staphylococci often develop abscesses or furunculosis (Fig. 3.45\n).

A model of AAHC has been developed in rats by administering amoxicillin-clavulanate followed by orally infecting rats with a strain of K. oxytoca cultured from a patient with AAHC. Studies in humans suggest that K. oxytoca exerts its pathogenicity in part through a cytotoxin. Recently, authors have showed that several animal isolates of K. oxytoca, including clinical isolates, produced secreted products in bacterial culture supernatant that display cytotoxicity on HEp-2 and HeLa cells, indicating the ability to produce cytotoxin. Using mass spectroscopy techniques, they also confirmed tilivalline as the cytotoxin present in animal K. oxytoca strains. Tilivalline may serve as a biomarker for K. oxytoca-induced cytotoxicity (Darby et al., 2014).",

In the early 2000s, an increased interest in C. difficile infection (CDI) resulted from the emergence of a hyper-virulent strain (NAP1/BI/027) associated with frequent recurrences and more severe clinical disease (Abou Chakra et al., 2014; Mcfarland, 2009; Kuijper et al., 2006). C. difficile has also been implicated in antibiotic-associated colitis in Syrian hamsters (Bartlett et al., 1977), guinea pigs (Lowe et al., 1980), rabbits (Thilsted et al., 1981; Ryden et al., 1991), prairie dogs (Muller et al., 1987), ostriches (Frazier et al., 1993), and horses (Diab et al., 2013). C. difficile is a rod-shaped strict anaerobe. Cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar (CCFA) is a commonly used selective medium for C. difficile. Cultures are incubated under anaerobic conditions at 35\u201337\u00b0C. When grown on blood agar, C. difficile colonies are nonhemolytic and gray, and have a slightly raised umbonate profile with filamentous edges and a ground-glass appearance. Colonies grown on blood agar have fluorescence under ultraviolet light. C. difficile forms acid from glucose and fructose, but is negative on lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Two closely related exotoxins, Toxin A and Toxin B, are produced by C. difficile. Recent taxonomic classification support placement of C. difficile and its close relatives within the family Peptostreptococcaceae. The authors suggested renaming it Peptoclostridium difficile (Yutin and Galperin, 2013).",

Susceptibility of mice to infection must be induced by disrupting the microbiota through antibiotic treatment. Brief exposure to environmental spore contamination is sufficient for transmission of C. difficile to na\u00efve but susceptible mice. The CDI transmission model has been used to demonstrate that clindamycin treatment of asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile can inadvertently trigger the excretion of high levels of spores (Lawley et al., 2009). A C57BL mouse model of recurrence/relapse CDI has been reported (Sun et al., 2011). The primary bout of CDI induced little or no protective antibody response against C. difficile toxins and mice continued shedding C. difficile spores. Antibiotic treatment of surviving mice induced a second episode of diarrhea. A simultaneous reexposure of mice to C. difficile bacteria or spores elicited a full clinical spectrum of CDI similar to that of the primary infection. Immunosuppressive agents resulted in more severe and fulminant recurrent disease. Vancomycin treatment only delayed disease recurrence; however, neutralizing polysera against both TcdA and TcdB completely protected mice against CDI relapse (Sun et al., 2011). A recent study in C57BL mice demonstrated that antibiotic-mediated alteration of the gut microbiome favors a global metabolic profile, and therefore increases susceptibility to C. difficile clinical diseases (Theriot et al., 2014).",

The role of T cells in resistance is not clear, because susceptibility among athymic mice appears to vary (Livingston et al., 1996).

In the liver, foci of coagulation necrosis are generally distributed along branches of the portal vein, a finding compatible with embolic infection from the intestine.

B cells have also been shown to be critical to clearance of infection and the mechanism appears only partially related to IgG and has a more important role in promoting activation and expansion of T cells (Lund et al., 2003). B cells may also protect early hematopoietic progenitor activity during systemic responses to pneumocystis infection (Hoyt et al., 2014). Infection proceeds slowly, but relentlessly in immunodeficient mice leading to clinical signs of pneumonia, usually within several months.

            "text": "Pinworm infestation is one of the most commonly encountered problems in laboratory mice. A national survey revealed that more than 30% of barrier colonies and about 70% of conventional colonies were affected (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1997; Carty, 2008). Syphacia obvelata infestation can occur unexpectedly in commercial barrier murine colonies, resulting in widespread dissemination of the parasite into academic mouse colonies. The epizootiological impact of pinworm infestation is increased by the airborne dissemination of eggs, which can remain infectious even after drying. The life-cycle is direct and completed in 11\u201315 days. Females deposit their eggs on the skin and hairs of the perianal region. Ingested eggs liberate larvae in the small intestine and they migrate to the cecum within 24 h. Worms remain in the cecum for 10\u201311 days, where they mature and mate. The females then migrate to the large intestine to deposit their eggs as they leave the host. There is unconfirmed speculation that larvae may reenter the rectum. Infestation usually begins in young mice and can recur, but adult mice tend to be more resistant. Syphacia infestation often occurs in combination with Aspiculuris tetraptera. Because the life cycle of Syphacia is much shorter than that of Aspiculuris, the number of mice that are apt to be infected with S. obvelata is correspondingly greater. There is evidence that resistance to infestation may be mouse strain-specific (Derothe et al., 1997).",

Eggs are usually detected by pressing cellophane tape to the perineal area and then to a glass slide that is examined by microscopy. Aspiculuris tetraptera eggs are not ordinarily found in tape preparations and are easily differentiated from eggs of S. obvelata (see below). Adult worms can be found in cecal or colonic contents diluted in a Petri dish of warm tap water. They are readily observed with the naked eye or with a dissecting microscope. An ELISA also is available to detect serum antibodies to S. obvelata somatic antigens (Sato et al., 1995).

Because some of the recommended therapies have the potential for toxicity, it is prudent to keep mice under close clinical observation during treatment (Davis et al., 1999; Skopets et al., 1996; Toth et al., 2000). Fenbendazole diets can be fed with 1 week on/1 week off rotation with normal chow although the potential impact on experimental data must be considered (Duan et al., 2012; Gadad et al., 2010; Landin et al., 2009). Prevention of reinfestation requires strict isolation because Syphacia eggs become infective as soon as 6 h after they are laid, and they survive for weeks, even in dry conditions. Strict sanitation, sterilization of feed and bedding, and periodic anthelmintic treatment are required to control infestation. The use of microbarrier cages can reduce the spread of infective eggs.\n",

Other strains, such as BALB/c and C3H are highly resistant to amyloidosis (Percy and Barthold, 2007). Secondary amyloidosis is usually associated with chronic inflammatory lesions, including dermatitis resulting from prolonged acariasis. It can be induced experimentally, however, by injection of casein and may occur locally in association with neoplasia or in ovarian corpora lutea in the absence of other disease. In reactive amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, serum AA (SAA) protein forms deposits in mice, domestic and wild animals, and humans that experience chronic inflammation. AA amyloid fibrils are abnormal \u03b2-sheet-rich forms of the serum precursor SAA, with conformational changes that promote fibril formation. Similar to prion diseases, recent findings suggest that AA amyloidosis could be transmissible in mice and other species (Murakami et al., 2014). Amyloid fibrils induce a seeding-nucleation process that may lead to development of AA amyloidosis.

            "text": "\nVitamin deficiencies in mice have not been thoroughly described. Unfortunately, much of the information that does exist reflects work carried out 30\u201350 years ago; thus, the reliability and specificity of some of these syndromes is questionable. Vitamin A deficiency may produce tremors, diarrhea, rough hair coat, keratitis, poor growth, abscesses, hemorrhages, and sterility or abortion. Vitamin A is recognized for its importance in development of the immune system (Ross, 2012) and knockout mouse models have been used to demonstrate genetic polymorphisms in humans that negatively regulate intestinal \u03b2-carotene absorption and conversion to retinoids in response to vitamin A requirements for growth and reproduction (Von Lintig, 2012). Vitamin E deficiency can cause convulsions and heart failure, as well as muscular dystrophy and hyaline degeneration of muscles. Two knockout mouse models of severe vitamin E deficiency were independently developed and lack \u03b1-tocopherol transfer protein (\u03b1-TTP), a gene that controls plasma and tissue \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations by exporting \u03b1-tocopherol from the liver. Ttpa\n\u2212/\u2212 mice have very low to undetectable levels of \u03b1-tocopherol and are infertile. The phenotype includes neuronal degeneration associated with progressive ataxia and age-related behavioral defects (Yu and Schellhorn, 2013). Deficiency of B complex vitamins produces nonspecific signs such as alopecia, decreased feed consumption, poor growth, poor reproduction and lactation, as well as a variety of neurological abnormalities. Choline deficiency produces fatty livers and nodular hepatic hyperplasia, as well as myocardial lesions, decreased conception, and decreased viability of litters. Folic acid-deficient diets cause marked decreases in red and white cell blood counts and the disappearance of megakaryocytes and nucleated cells from the spleen. Pantothenic acid deficiency is characterized by nonspecific signs, such as weight loss, alopecia, achromotrichia, and posterior paralysis, as well as other neurological abnormalities. Thiamin deficiency is associated with neurological signs, such as violent convulsions, cartwheel movements, and decreased food consumption. Dietary requirements for ascorbic acid have not been shown in mice, and mouse diets are generally not fortified with ascorbic acid. The gulonolactone oxidase knockout mouse (Gulo\n\u2212/\u2212) on the C57BL/6 background requires vitamin C supplementation although the plasma ascorbate concentration of Gulo\n\u2212/\u2212 mice fed a vitamin C-deficient diet is maintained at 15% of wild-type concentrations, suggesting an uncharacterized pathway to generate a small amount of ascorbate (Yu and Schellhorn, 2013). The Gulo\n\u2212/\u2212 mouse has become the model of choice in studying the role of vitamin C in complex diseases. Vitamin C production has been successfully restored in Gulo\n\u2212/\u2212 mice using adenovirus vectors, making it possible to robustly manipulate physiological ascorbate concentrations in an inbred mouse.",

Significant pruritus leads to skin trauma associated with opportunistic bacterial infection and deep dermal ulcerations. Initial signs include alopecia and papular dermatitis, which usually occur over the dorsal trunk (Fig. 3.59\n). Progressive inflammation can be halted, sometimes reversed, by nail trimming and therapy with a wide spectrum of topical or systemic antibiotics, steroids, and other drugs such as Vitamin E and aloe, all of which speak to the frustrating search for a primary etiology. Treatment should be based on microbiological culture and sensitivity and screening for ectoparasites as hypersensitivity to acariasis has been proposed. Seasonal fluctuation in the incidence of disease suggests that environmental factors may play a role. The incidence appears to increase during periods of significant seasonal changes in temperature and humidity, i.e., the onset of winter and early spring. There is some evidence that incidence is related to dietary fat with mice on high fat or ad libitum diets being more susceptible than those on restricted diets (Neuhaus et al., 2012).",

Lactating mice are either found dead or becoming moribund. Segments of the small intestine become distended with fluid contents and histologically there is apoptosis of the villus epithelium of the small intestine and superficial epithelial cells of the large intestine. The enteric nervous system appears morphologically normal but necrotic enterocytes, mucosal erosions, and acute mucosal inflammation are commonly observed. There is no strong evidence for metabolic issues such as hypocalcemia or low blood glucose.

Mouse genetics have been shown to be more important than potential light associated tissue injury (Serfilippi et al., 2004a). Other strains such as C3H, CBA, and FVB are genetically predisposed to retinal degeneration because they carry the rd gene, which leads to retinal degeneration within the first few weeks of life and has been used extensively as a model for retinitis pigmentosa (Farber and Danciger, 1994).

Cells can spread to the other lobe and then to other hematopoietic organs, such as the spleen, bone marrow, liver, and peripheral lymph nodes. Clinical signs include dyspnea and ocular protrusion. The latter sign is due to compression of venous blood returning from the head. Tumor cells spill into the circulation late in disease. Most of these tumors originate from T lymphocytes or lymphoblasts, but there are leukemias of B-lymphocyte or null cell lineage. In the last two syndromes, the lymph nodes and spleen are often involved, but the thymus is generally normal.",
