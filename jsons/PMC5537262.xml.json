            "text": "T2DM is on the rise1. It is characterized by hyperglycaemia due to insulin resistance and decreased insulin activity. Genetic factors, environmental agents and their interactions have been recognized as contributors to the development of T2DM2\u20134. As of 2014, more than 371 million people reportedly suffer from T2DM in several countries with China at the top (92.3 million) followed by India (80 million) and the USA (29.1 million)5. Before the era of genome wide association studies (GWAS), hunting for genetic factors produced a handful of genes such as CAPN10, TCF7L2, PPARG and KCNJ11\n6, 7. The association of TCF7L2, PPARG and KCNJ11 with T2DM have been observed in several populations and both PPARG and KCNJ11 proteins are targets of currently used T2DM drugs7. The GWAS era including meta-analysis enabled uncovering of numerous genes and their variants associated with T2DM. Yet these variants apparently are able to explain only about 20\u201330% of heritable component8. Re-sequencing is now emerging to enable comprehensive variants discovery with its identified potential not offered by imputation and chip based fine-mapping approaches8. These efforts can get further challenged by gene environment interactions whereby phenotypic effects for given genotypes likely vary9. Diet and physical activity are most considered among environmental factors. Dietary components could affect directly (through interaction with targets) and indirectly (through interaction with gut microbiome). Although some compounds such as vitamins and organic pollutants such as heptachlor epoxide and polychlorinated biphenyls have been studied, this area is relatively under investigated and most environmental agents are not known5, 10. Despite these deficiencies the huge body of studies carried out so far including those in animal models have endowed us with many genes associated with T2DM and its associated complications that can serve for identifying drug targets, potential biomarkers and clinical applications.",

Recently Fuchsberger et al. analysed the T2DM associated variants by increasing the sample size and observed that most of the variants were located within the same regions previously identified by GWAS14. Studies including meta-analysis enabled identification of 44 genetic loci associated independently with transcriptome data sets of human tissues from T2DM patients. These studies are valuable for gaining insights into the probable pathways leading to T2DM15, 16. Integration of genes co-expression and interaction networks enabled identification of TGFBRII, MAPK, PTPN1, EGFR, and CAV1 pathways, which could lead to cardiovascular and kidney related complications and diabetic nephropathy and Zelezniak et al. integrated skeletal muscle gene expression datasets with human metabolic network reconstructions, which enabled them to identify transcription factors CREB, NRF1 and PPAR family regulatory network connecting several parts of metabolism17, 18. Zhong et al. (2010)19 identified a functionally related set of diabetes susceptibility genes using expression SNPs (eSNPs) comprising an adipose sub-network and subsequently validated malic enzyme (ME1), which converts malate to pyruvate19.",

T2D-Db provides information at molecular level for type 2 diabetes and its pathogenesis and there are 83 genes for T2DM associated complications, namely, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy and cardiovascular diseases. T2D Knowledge portal is a database of DNA sequence, functional and epigenomic information, and clinical data from studies on type 2 diabetes and complications as well as provides analysis of this data. T2DiACoD containing 650 genes as on date is a repository, which stores information on genes associated with T2DM complications, protective genes and their roles, Drug targets, population SNPs data, expression analysis in different tissues of T2DM patients, miRNAs, 34 miRNAs and their target genes involved in associated complications of T2DM, interactions with risk factors, namely obesity, inflammation, diet and stress of genes associated with T2DM complications.",

The gene ACVR1C (activin A receptor type 1C) studied in 2015 with high BWI value 1547.5 is a member of TGF-beta receptors and is reportedly correlated in expression with pathogenic risk of T2DM as well as cardiovascular diseases. Silencing of ACVR1C/ALK7 gene has reportedly protective effect on diabetes induced aortic stiffness, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia39. 129 genes were studied in multiple years including PON1, NOS3, TNF (tumor necrosis factor), TNFRSF11B (OPG), HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1), and ADIPOQ. The gene PON1 (paraoxonase 1), an anti-inflammatory high density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated enzyme, has been shown to decrease in diabetic patients40, 41, and its low concentration and enzymatic activity could be independent predictor of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients42. The synergic effect of NOS3 (eNOS) Asp298 allele confirms its pathological role for cardiovascular diseases in T2DM patients43. Blazquez-Medela et al. (2012) studied relationship between serum TNFRSF11B (Osteoprotegerin (OPG)) and vascular alteration in associated pathologies and its levels were found to be higher in diabetic, hypertensive with retinopathy and cardiovascular risk patients and therefore associated with cardiovascular risk in diabetes and hypertension patients44. The G allele of ADIPOQ (adiponectin) G276T polymorphism is a susceptible allele for cardiovascular disease in T2DM patients45 and increased serum HMGB1 level was associated with cardiovascular diseases in T2DM patients46.",

DHCR7 (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase) with BWI 135.8 and B2M (beta-2-microglobulin) with BWI 359.8 had high BWI values indicating good emphasis of the corresponding genes in these studies. DHCR7 was recently investigated for its role in T2DM to influence subclinical atherosclerosis using Mendelian randomization approach and carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) measurements47. Strawbridge et al. observed rs3829251 (DHCR7) influenced the progression of atherosclerosis in T2DM patients. Glycation of B2M may contribute to the risk of diabetes associated complications. Kim et al. in 2014 reported higher serum B2M as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy (DN) in T2DM patients48. Genes IRAK4, HDAC9, ACSL1 and APPL159 are recently reported as atherosclerosis causing genes in T2DM patients. 59 genes were reportedly being investigated in multiple years for their role in atherosclerosis, for example the genes ABCA1, PON1, MTHFR, PLTP, PPAR, TNFRSF11B (OPG), FABP4, and IL18 are being studied for several years since 1997 with varying emphasis. ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) was noted as atheroprotective protein49 in that it protects against the formation of atherosclerosis and macrophage ABCA1 protects arteries from promoting atherosclerosis lesions50. Polymorphism or genetic aberrations in ABCA1 gene can be associated with severity of atherosclerosis51. Sartippour et al. (2000) evaluated the in vitro and ex vivo effect of high glucose concentrations on macrophage PPAR (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) mRNA expression52 and observed that dysregulation of macrophage PPAR expression in T2DM alters arterial lipid metabolism and inflammatory response and might contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis in T2DM. Upregulation of FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein 4) further enhances the macrophage lipid accumulation by advanced glycation end products (AGE), which further accelerates formation of foam cells and development of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients53. Nakamura et al. studied whether serum level of IL-18 (Interleukin 18) is a common predictor of nephropathy and atherosclerosis in T2DM patients. They observed that serum and urinary level of IL-18 were significantly elevated in T2DM patients compared to controls thereby indicating that serum levels of IL-18 could be a predictor for these complications54.",

Genes LRP2, NGAL, IGFBP7, CUBN, CHIT1 are recently reported genes in diabetic nephropathy. The TRIB3 \u2018G\u2019 allele was identified as associated with diabetic nephropathy and it was suggested that this observation may help to improve targeting of therapy to diabetic patients55. Zhang et al. characterized diabetic nephropathy (DN) by mesangial proliferation and glomerular hypertrophy. microRNAs are implicated in this pathogenesis. They discovered hsa-miR-34a regulated mesangial proliferation and glomerular hypertophy by directly inhibiting GAS1 in early DN56. In case of IL1B the C511T variant is reported associated with development of DN57. IRS2 is discussed as marker or mediator of human DN58. RREB1 is considered as novel candidate gene for T2DM associated kidney diseases59. 163 genes out of 403 are studied in multiple years.

It is reported that homocysteine upregulates Matrix metalloproteinases-tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (MMP-TIMP) pathway and IL6 release, the effect being stronger in the presence of high glucose, which further contributes to increased atherogenesis in diabetic patients76. Advanced glycation end-product of low-density-lipoprotein (AGE-LDL) activates TLR4-mediated signaling pathway, thus inducing proinflammatory cytokine production, with increased risk of atherosclerosis in diabetics77.

Consequently, we observed higher number of unique GOs (41) associated with the genes implicated in DN.

The hsa-miR-21 modulates the PTEN-AKT pathway and thus antagonises the insulin resistance in adipocytes. The hsa-miRNA-21can be a new therapeutic target for metabolic disease such as T2DM and obesity99.",

For example in the case of ACE\u2019s role in cardiovascular, there is positive evidence in 1995 and 2003 but in 2005 in Chinese population a negative evidence was observed. On the other hand the role in Nephropathy, in 1995 there was negative evidence overturned in 2005 and later supported in as recent as 2015. Another noteworthy example is in case of VEGFA. The role of VEGFA in Retinopathy and Nephropathy was negative in several populations but reported positive in Caucasian (Retinopathy) in the years as recently as 2013\u20132015. Likewise in the case of TNFRS11B, negative evidences were documented in the years 2011 and 2013 but overturned in 2015 in its association with Atherosclerosis.

In general, if an abstract in a given year contains repeated mention of a gene due to its detailed characterization carried out in the study and reported compared to all the abstracts texts in previous years, the BWI registers a high value. We used a minimum of BWI = 1 in order to collect all the genes attributed with some importance. A single occurrence of a given gene in a given year would have its corresponding BWI register \u201czero\u201d in that year.",

The affymetrix data were pre-processed using the affy package166. The .CEL files for each GSE id was read using ReadAffy() and subsequently we performed the background correction and computed the expression using the robust mean average (rma()) function with \u2018normalize = FALSE\u2019, which computes the expression and performs the background correction. The Illumina data were pre-processed using lumi package167 of Bioconductor. The lumi package was used to read the illumina BeadStudio output file for each GSE id using the lumiR() function followed by background correction and computed the expression using the robust mean average (rma()) function with \u2018normalize = FALSE\u2019, which computes the expression and performs the background correction. Subsequently, the expression of probes with detection p-values < 0.05 was retained to eliminate low signal intensity genes. The pre-processed data was transformed individually into standard normal using the modified Z-score method based on median absolute deviation (MAD)168. MAD measures the variability in the sample about its median.

It provides functional annotation and analysis of gene list. The lists of genes were submitted to functional annotation in DAVID to analyze the Gene Ontology (GO), protein domains and pathways. The relevant GO terms associated with input gene list were extracted and analyzed. The GO structure mainly contains three categories, namely, Biological Process (BP) for biological goals, Molecular Function (MF) describing functional roles and Cellular Component (CC) indicates the cellular location where gene products are active. The output table was obtained with the following information: Annotation Cluster, Enrichment Score, Category, Term, Count, % (involved genes/total genes), PValue, Genes, List Total, Pop Hits, Pop Total, Fold Enrichment, Bonferroni, Benjamini and FDR. P-Value (calculated by Fishers\u2019 exact test) as well as FDR< = 0.05 were considered strongly enriched in the annotation categories. The cytoscape plugin EnrichmentMap was used for graphical display of GO terms172. EnrichmentMap is a visualisation method for the gene set enrichment results. In the graph, nodes represent gene set involved in the GO term and edges represent the extent of overlap of genes between the two gene sets connected by them. Node size and edge width are proportional to the number of genes. The connection between two nodes describes set of genes that two nodes have in common.",
