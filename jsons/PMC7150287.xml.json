            "text": "Epidemiologists have placed much greater emphasis on the measure of response than on the measure of exposure. They claim that this is because most epidemiologists have been trained as physicians and are consequently more oriented toward measuring health outcomes. It is certainly true that a modern textbook of epidemiology says very little about what the epidemiologist should do with exposure assessments. However, this is probably as \u2018much a reflection of the historical paucity of quantitative exposure information as a reflection on the background of epidemiologists. Nevertheless, it is surprising how many epidemiological studies do not contain even a basic qualitative assessment of exposure. The contrast between epidemiology and toxicology is never more marked than in the area of estimation of dose response. The toxicologist can carefully control the conditions of exposure to the agent of interest; moreover, the toxicologist can be sure that the test animals have not come into contact with any other toxic agents. An industrial epidemiologist conducting a study of workers exposed to a hepatotoxin will certainly have to control for alcohol intake and possibly for exposure to other hepatotoxins in the work and home environments. Nevertheless, it can be argued that epidemiological studies more accurately measure the effect on human health of \u2018real-life\u2019 exposures.",

It is a more difficult process when, as is common, only a qualitative measure of exposure is available (e.g., high, medium, and low). Even when exposure measurements are available, it may not be sensible to make an assumption that an exposure that occurred 20 years ago is equivalent to the same exposure yesterday. The use of average exposures may also be questionable, and peak exposures may be more relevant in the case of outcomes such as asthma and chronic bronchitis. Noise is a good example of an exposure that must be carefully characterized and where the simple calculation of a cumulative exposure may be misleading.",

However, historical cohort studies are beset by a variety of problems. Principal among these is the problem of determining which workers have been exposed and, if so, to what degree? In addition, it may be difficult to decide what an appropriate comparison group is. It should also be borne in mind that in epidemiology, unlike animal experimentation, random allocation is not possible and there is no control over the factors that may distort the effects of the exposure of interest, such as smoking and the standard of living.",

This requires that a clear statement be made about membership of the cohort so that it is easy to decide whether an employee is a member or not. It is also important that the follow-up period be carefully defined. For instance, it is readily apparent that the follow-up period should not start before exposure has occurred. Furthermore, it is uncommon for the health effect of interest to manifest itself immediately after exposure, and allowance for an appropriate biological induction (or latency) period may need to be made when interpreting the data.",

Each person year is characterized by the age and sex of the cohort member and the time period when survival occurred. The person years are then multiplied by age-, sex-, and time period-specific mortality rates to obtain the expected number of deaths. The ratio between observed and expected deaths is expressed as a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) as follows:SMR=observeddeaths100\u00d7expecteddeathsThus, an SMR of 1.25 represents an excess mortality of 25%. An SMR can be calculated for different causes of death and for subdivision of the person years by factors such as the level of exposure and time since the first exposure.",

Nevertheless, this selection effect, known as the \u2018healthy worker\u2019 effect, can lead to considerable arguments over the interpretation of study results, particularly if the cancer mortality is as expected but the all-cause mortality is much lower than expected.

The relationships between changes in the parameters of interest and exposure measurements have to be estimated and, if necessary, a comparison made of changes in the parameters between groups. These relationships may be extremely complicated, compounded by factors such as aging, and difficult to estimate because there may be relatively few measurement points. Furthermore, large errors of measurement in the variables may be pre1sent because of factors such as within-laboratory variation and temporal variation within individuals. Missing observations and withdrawals may also cause problems, particularly if they are dependent on the level and change of the parameter of interest. These problems may make it difficult to interpret and judge the validity of analytical conclusions.

For cases and controls the exposure odds are simply the odds of being exposed, and the OR is defined asV=caseswithexposure/controlswithexposurecaseswithoutexposure/controlswithoutexposureAn OR of 1 indicates that the rate of disease is unaffected by exposure of workers to the agent of interest.

For example, veterinary epidemiology can play a key role in emerging and global disease outbreaks, helping in the understanding and prevention of infections and other emerging diseases, including those transmitted from an animal to other animals, and those possibly transmitted from animals to humans. An example of a veterinary epidemiological study was one investigating the transmission of Salmonella typhimurium from cattle which had received no growth-promoting antibiotics to humans who had direct contact with the sick animals. Another example is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In the investigation of the origins of the SARS outbreak in China, viruses associated with SARS were isolated from Himalayan palm civets found in a live-animal market in Guangdong, China, and evidence of virus infection was also detected in other animals and in humans working at the same market.
