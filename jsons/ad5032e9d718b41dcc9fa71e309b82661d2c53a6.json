The therapy is based on anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics, and only rarely is infection prophylaxis provided. Bacterial lysates (BL) are a family of \"biological\" drugs that were introduced in therapy many decades ago, but only in the last 10 years has their mechanism of action has been elucidated. Since the first in vivo studies, it was hypothesized that the clinical effects observed were related to the capacity of BL to elicit a specific immune-response against bacterial antigens. Along this line, since the mid 1970s, specific IgA directed against bacterial antigens have been observed in the salivary fluid of treated patients [1] [2] [3] [4] following the oral administration of bacterial lysates. During the 1990s, the description of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family and its functions [5] within the larger context of the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) system explained how the innate immune system was alerted by the presence of different stimuli, mainly represented by bacterial derived structures. In that same period, the central role of dendritic cells (DC) in the generation of an efficient immuneresponse was described [6] . Starting from these lines of evidence, different bacterial lysates were shown to be able to induce significant activation and maturation of DC in vitro [7, 8] . More recently, using a specific member of the bacterial lysate family (the Polyvalent Mechanical Bacterial Lysate -PMBL), other relevant effects were observed on B cells, T cells and NK cells [9, 10] and these effects were also correlated with the clinical results [11, 12] . Bacterial lysates are obtained by physical or chemical lysis. The former are in general composed of fragments of bacterial bodies. The latter may be constituted by either only low molecular weight proteins or a mixture of bacterial bodies and soluble proteins. Lantigen B belongs to the latter family, being a suspension of bacterial antigens obtained from Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae type b and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The in vivo effects of Lantigen B were first described in the mid 1970s [11] [12] [13] . Since that time, few studies have been performed on this specific drug. Although the first studies were considered obsolete from a procedural point of view [14] [15] [16] , the drug remained in the pharmacological armamentarium of both general practitioners and specialists. In this context, other studies even if not totally in line with modern clinical trial practice have been published [17] [18] [19] , further demonstrating the clinical efficacy of Lantigen B. In particular, the main effect observed was the reduction of infections during the observation period. Indeed, by analyzing all the abovementioned studies, it can be calculated that a mean of 1.73 episodes/year were observed in treated patients vs. 2.63/year in the placebo group, corresponding to a reduction of 34% of the number of infectious episodes. In addition, in the same studies, the reduction of cough, of lost days and antibiotics use was also observed. Of note, only one non-positive study on the common cold [20] was published, while all the others demonstrated the efficacy of the treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 158, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 802, "end": 805, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 806, "end": 809, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 810, "end": 813, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 814, "end": 817, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 965, "end": 968, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1313, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1471, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1474, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1672, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1673, "end": 1676, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1742, "end": 1746, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1750, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2355, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2360, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2361, "end": 2365, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2524, "end": 2528, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2529, "end": 2533, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2534, "end": 2538, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2758, "end": 2762, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2763, "end": 2767, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2768, "end": 2772, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3355, "end": 3359, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this study, using modern and effective clinical practice tools, we re-evaluated the efficacy of Lantigen B in a double blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in inducing a significant reduction in the number of infectious episodes in an unselected (real life-like) population of patients with RRTI.

The distribution of IE between the placebo To further support this difference, a non-parametric analysis of the number of infectious episodes showed a median value of 0 in the treated group and 1 in the placebo group.

In the first interval, the differences in the number of events (eight in the placebo and five in the treated group) as well as the mean intervals (in days) were not significant. However, the cumulative hazard of suffering from an IE was 15% for the placebo and 9% for the Lantigen B group. Similar results, even if not statistically significant, were observed for the second interval (six EI for the placebo and two for the Lantigen B group). The relevant cumulative hazards of developing an IE in the second interval were 0.11 and 0.035 for placebo and Lantigen B groups. The concomitant drug use in the treated and in the control groups was also evaluated by a logistic regression analysis. For this, three families of drugs the use of antibiotics and NSAIDs was evaluated in the whole population, while anti-allergic drugs, which included bronchodilators, local corticosteroids and anti-histamine were evaluated in the subset of allergic patients. No significant differences were observed between the treated and control groups, even if a clear trend was evident: indeed, the treated patients were always treated less.

Indeed, this phase IV study was conducted at 12 different centers, using a double blind, placebo controlled study protocol. The authors are aware that few studies on the effects of bacterial lysates have been conducted in the past, using controlled clinical trials in Good Clinical Practice (GPC) trained hospitals. For this study, the foreseen number of patients to be recruited was 190 and 30 were expected to be lost during the study. However, the clinical centers, even though strongly committed, were able to recruit 160 patients. Of these, more than 25% were lost and only 117 patients could be evaluated at the end of the study. The loss of one-fourth of Table 3b Adverse reaction in the placebo group. the patient cohort is a relevant phenomenon. Despite this reduction, the post-hoc analysis showed that the number of evaluable patients was still sufficient to maintain the statistical relevance of the study and thus the validity of the observed results. Moreover, the adverse reactions recorded as well as the causes of dropout were extremely heterogeneous and all virtually unrelated to the treatment. A significant reduction in the number of IE was observed in the treated group: an average of 0.86 episodes in the 8 month study period was observed in the Lantigen B treated patients, while in the placebo group the mean was 1.43 episodes. In this context, it should be noted that, for the population recruited, the average number of previous IE was 5.34/year (corresponding to 3.56/8 months). As stated before, in the period of the study, the mean number of IE in the placebo group was 1.43/8 months (females 1.24 IE, males 1.80 IE). This difference may have different explanations. Different weather and epidemic conditions in the two subsequent years, differences in winter and spring climates such as a warmer temperature or a less aggressive flu virus epidemic may reduce the number of respiratory tract infections, allowing the placebo to mimic a pharmacologically positive effect. Moreover, a certain susceptibility to the effects of a placebo (more evident in females than in males) and a certain tendency to increase the number of IE in both groups when describing the severity of their conditions may have also influenced the study results. With regard to the different period epidemiology, it should be noted that the survey of virus infections in the study season, when compared with that of the previous \"cold\" season, showed virtually identical results, with the main viruses (influenza, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and RSV) having the same prevalence in the two period. Therefore, this finding did not support the hypothesis of different \"infectious\" environments causing a different number of respiratory tract infections in the study population. The reduction in the number of IE in the placebo group may have depended on a well-known bias, the Hawthorne effect. This phenomenon, originally defined in an industrial setting [23] has been extended to the realm of medical research [24, 25] and suggests that the subjects' behavior or the study results may be altered by the subjects' awareness that they are being studied or if they received additional attention.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3166, "end": 3170, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3222, "end": 3226, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3227, "end": 3230, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 875, "end": 883, "text": "Table 3b", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It should also be noted that recruitment was based on the number of respiratory tract infections in the previous year. Even if not generalized, a certain tendency of patients to (involuntary) increase their reported number of infectious episodes might have occurred, and this fact should at least in part explain the differences observed. However, to overcome these problems, double blind placebo controlled studies (like the present one) are mandatory to measure the differences between the treatment and placebo in the same period of the year and in the same locations. In this context, the finding that neither the doctors nor the patients really recognized the superior activity of the treatment is also intriguing. Of course, the positive effects of the placebo, as discussed above, had a certain role. But, more importantly, the differences observed were homogenously distributed between the placebo and the treated groups. This clearly means that the positive effects of the administration of bacterial lysates could be observed at a population level while they were less evident at individual level. In addition, this can also explain why the medical community is sometimes skeptical about the use of these drugs. Indeed, just using personal daily experience and feelings, it is difficult to establish whether this family of drugs is active.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Some interesting, if inconclusive data can be derived from the analysis of the use of the drugs in the two groups. No statistically significant differences were observed between the placebo and the treated groups for antibiotics, NSAIDs, bronchodilators, antihistamine and local steroids. However, a clear trend was observed in the treated groups; the use of drugs was always reduced in this group. With regard to the small group of allergic patients, the first observation was that in the population of RRTI patients, patients with allergy symptoms represented 40% of the total. It was evident that the treatment with Lantigen B did not significantly alter the number of allergic episodes or the number of days with allergy. This finding was not expected even if the strict correlation between the allergy symptoms and respiratory infectious diseases could suggest a potential positive effect [20] . A certain effect was observed, as a trend, in the use of anti-allergy drugs: indeed, in allergic patients, logistic regression showed that the probability of using drugs specific for allergy was reduced. Some criticism can be raised on this study: (a) the number of patients recruited, even if statistically correct, is not very large; (b) during patient's recruitment and follow up, functional and laboratory tests were performed only if some IE or adverse reaction occurred; (c) concomitant diseases, potentially mimicking symptoms of the respiratory tract (such as unknown primary immune deficiency -undiagnosed defect however rare in a study cohort aged between 18 and 65 years) were not specifically considered; (d) the non-perfect synchronism of the recruitment (started in September and closed in December 2012) associated to the 8-month follow-up, that could at least in part dilute the effects of typical infections of the winter-spring period. However, strengths of the study are several. In particular, (a) the rigorous randomization homogeneously distributed the abovementioned biases in the two cohorts; (b) the statistical analyses (ANCOVA and logistic regression) not only documented the effects of Lantigen B on the number of IE, but also identified a clear trend toward reduction of the use of concomitant therapies in Lantigen B treated patients; (c) the real life-like enrollment of patients (as stated by the heterogeneity of adverse reactions not related to the administration of the drug) is representative of the population that has daily access to the offices of general practitioners and specialists: thus, the observed results are reliable.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 894, "end": 898, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the administration of Lantigen B, evaluated in a double blind controlled clinical study, resulted in a significant reduction in the number of IE in the treated group.

The control of respiratory tract infections, at least in the familial or work environment, results in a reduced spread of the pathogen and in a reduced use of drugs such as antibiotics, with evident advantages for the patient and the community. In conclusion, the described results, together with the significant reduction in concomitant therapies and the virtual absence of any adverse reactions, indicates that this drug may be used as an effective first line drug for the prophylaxis of infectious episodes in patients with RRTI.
