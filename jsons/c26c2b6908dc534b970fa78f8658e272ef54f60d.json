Over 40 abstracts were submitted and 31 were accepted and placed in 2 tracks: zoonotic (16) and neonatal/infant (15) infectious diseases. Comments were sent to authors to help improve abstracts; commonly authors had not followed the predetermined structure and/or the methods did not match the study design described. Authors were paired with one of 5 US researchers to revise their abstracts. All revised abstracts were included in the workshop booklets.

GWU and NRC faculty led the sessions. The majority of scientists that had an abstract accepted presented posters, and the five best abstracts in each track gave oral presentations. After the combined sessions, participants joined either the zoonotic or the infant/neonatal infectious diseases workshop for training activities. On Day 1, participants formed small teams of 4-7 participants to identify knowledge gaps in the current state of EZIDs or neonatal/infant infectious diseases in Egypt. At the end of the day, teams presented their findings. On Day 2, teams that were formed on Day 1 were paired to encourage interaction and they developed research questions that addressed gaps in knowledge identified in the previous day. On Day 3, participants matched study designs to their questions and on Day 4, participants outlined a plan to complete research proposals. The workshop leaders rotated between groups to facilitate conversations and to provide guidance on study designs and methods. At the end of each day, teams presented their work. The workshops also held combined lunch and dinners each day to further facilitate interaction between participants.",
