Since most affected patients have mild to no symptoms, it remains crucial to quickly relate any commonly observed symptoms and to do so widely. Cough, fever, and/or trouble breathing are the major symptoms that have been publicly communicated in a consistent manner. Meanwhile, the people with the greatest knowledge of current symptoms are the healthcare workers in the countries being most affected (e.g. Italy, France, Iran), yet they also have the least time to transmit this important information to the greater public.",

His recent interactions with patients and other doctors have rapidly led to the realization that sudden loss of smell (anosmia) and/or taste (ageusia) may be experienced in the infected, symptoms not commonly reported in China. The other author (Yann Ravussin), an obesity researcher currently living in Geneva, has recently experienced a rapid onset of anosmia following 2 to 3 days of strong fatigue and headache. Having presented no fever, coughing, or breathing problems, he initially decided that COVID\u201019 was unlikely based on readily available news outlets and official governmental websites (CDC, Swiss Government Health) yet was subsequently told he likely had the virus but did not reach the criteria for testing based on age and/or symptoms. Yet it is slowly emerging that these symptoms are quite common. Anosmia has been reported to be found in upwards of 2/3 of patients in Germany by epidemiologist Hendrik Streek (1) while Italian and Swiss doctors are reporting similar findings with many also displaying ageusia. Numbers from South Korea suggest that 30% of positive patients had anosmia as the primary presenting symptom.",

This moment in our lives will be complicated, stressful, and full of unknowns but with better knowledge transfer should come better decision\u2010making to keep us and our loved ones safe.",
