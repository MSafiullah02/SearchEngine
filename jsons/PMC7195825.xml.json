With support of ED leadership, continued HIV screening of patients was incorporated into the design of this secondary ED space, with a station for lab draws designated for HIV screening. This space otherwise has extremely limited diagnostic capacity, with capabilities only for chest x-ray, EKG, viral swab, and strep swabs (Fig. 1). There was initially some resistance to HIV testing on the part of staff, many of whom felt that COVID-19 should be the sole priority. However, ED leadership offered provider education regarding the overlap of symptoms between COVID-19 and acute HIV and emphasized the opportunity for wide community screening. This messaging was positively received by ED staff. Outside of the temporary space, workflows and HIV screening continued as normal with automated EMR alerts and test orders.",

In order not to lose ground, it is important to maintain HIV screening and linkage to care, even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. HIV elimination initiatives in Illinois and nationwide require expansion and intensification of HIV screening and linkage to care efforts [4, 5]. There should be no reduction in this important effort, even with the obstacles posed by COVID-19. While there are many obvious challenges to EDs during the pandemic, there are also possible opportunities to reach patients who otherwise would not have sought care. Maintaining high levels of routine HIV screening in the ED is crucial, as other community-based organizations and health clinics may have ceased to offer in-person evaluations and HIV screening, making it even more difficult to be tested for HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic [6, 7].",

Provider education emphasizing the importance of continued screening and overlap of symptoms between acute HIV and COVID-19 ensured staff buy in. The two patients with AHI presented with ILI and would likely have been misdiagnosed without the inclusion of HIV testing in the new ED space. AHI is a priority for care programs due to their high viral loads and high risk of transmission to others, increasing the importance of the identification of these cases [8].",
