There is no known treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19 to date. Immunotherapy and plasma therapy has been used with satisfactory efficacy over the past two decades in many viral infections like SARS (Systemic Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and H1N1. Limited data from China show clinical benefit, radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival. Our aim is to create a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission and then apply various control parameters to see their effects on recovery from COVID-19 disease. We have formulated a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations, calculated basic reproduction R0, and applied five different controls (self-isolation, quarantine, herd immunity, immunotherapy, plasma therapy) to test the effectiveness of control strategy. Control optimality was checked by Lagrangian functions. Numerical simulations and bifurcation analyses were carried out. The study concludes that the COVID-19 outbreak can be controlled up to a significant level three weeks after applying all the control strategies together. These strategies lead to a reduction in hospitalization and a rise in recovery from infection. Immunotherapy is highly effective initially in hospitalized infected individuals however better results were seen in the long term with plasma therapy.",

            "text": "There is no known treatment or vaccine available. The antimalarial drug chloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin have showed some hope against COVID-19 but its efficacy has been recently debated (Syal 2020) . Other potential therapeutic agents tried so far include Remdesivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir (Kaletra), Tocilizumab(Actemra), Remdesivir have shown some promise in controlling the COVID-19 disease. (Holshue et al. 2020; Lu 2020; Russell et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020) . Most people in developing countries cannot afford costly therapeutic interventions like mechanical ventilators and prolonged lockdown, pandemic must be curtailed so that health infrastructure can manage it efficiently. As there is no known treatment and vaccine available, herd immunity can help in decreasing its spread. (Syal 2020) Immunotherapy and plasma therapy has been used effectively as a therapeutic option against many viral infections. The main methods in immunotherapy include several vaccines and monoclonal antibody candidates. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy has been used for the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases for more than one century. In both SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus), and SARS-CoV-2 viruses' entry into the host cells is mediated by the interaction of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S protein on virus outer-membrane and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cell. So, these proteins can be the major potential targets for immunotherapy (AminJafari and Ghasemi 2020; Duan et al. 2020b) . CP refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following the resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Over the past two decades, CP therapy was successfully used in the treatment of SARS MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and 2009 H1N1 pandemic with satisfactory efficacy and safety (Cheng et al. 2005; Zhou et al. 2007; Hung et al. 2011; Ko et al. 2018) .",

While fractionated plasma products (e.g. hyperimmune globulin, monoclonal antibodies) and/or vaccination may offer durable therapeutic options, human anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma is the only therapeutic option that is immediately available for use to treat COVID-19 (Bloch et al. 2020) . Studies done by Shen et al, and Duan et al (Duan et al. 2020b; Shen et al. 2020) concluded that convalescent plasma therapy is well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcome. They collected CP from patients three weeks after they recovered from COVID-19, and from the patients who were having normal body temperature for > 3 days, not having respiratory symptoms, and there two consecutive PCR 3 SARS COV-2 test 24 hours apart has been negative. Their study result showed a decline in inflammatory markers, improvement in patient's antibody titer and PCR SARS COV-2 became negative. CFR (Case Fatality Rate) was 0 in the study done by Duan et al. However there were several limitations of the study including small sample size, lack of randomized double-blind controlled study, those patients received other medications like antivirals ( Kaletra), steroids at the same time, and it is difficult to attribute all improvement to plasma therapy alone. Their study indicates that convalescent plasma therapy could be the most critical weapon in the fight with COVID-19 in severe cases. Survivors of the COVID-19 may play a key role in both herd immunity as well as the availability of plasma therapy. (Syal 2020) .",

Moreover, in some cases recovered individuals again shows symptoms of the disease and hence they need to get hospitalisation again. These two situation are also considered in the present model. .

The control variable 4 () ut suggests to provide proper immunotherapy (include several types of vaccines, monoclonal antibody candidates, and etc.) to hospitalised individuals which helps them to fight against the viral infection. In present situation, where proper vaccination is not 7 available for the COVID-19, a convalescent plasma therapy have sparked a ray of hope. The Convalescent plasma therapy's effects as treatment for Covid-19 has been tested positive with no severe adverse effects (Duan et al. 2020a (Duan et al. , 2020b Shen et al. 2020 ).

In the initial week of the outbreak, higher intensity of infected, active and super active spreader is observed, after that, they decreases with time and become negligible in 5-6 weeks. In this duration, since individuals in exposed and hospitalised class are still present, again growth in infection is observed after 7-8 weeks of the outbreak. From this graph, we can say that without any control strategies the infection can re-emerge in the society after some time of duration. Hence proper control strategies are essential to break the periodic chain of this infection. Figure 4(a) and 4(b) displays the effect of super active spreaders on class of exposed and infected individuals respectively. Figure 4 (a) shows that exposed individuals are getting infected by super active spreaders at high rate. Figure 4(b) shows that infected individuals are moves towards the super active spreaders and they have tendency to becoming a super active spreader, while super active spreaders are also moving towards the infected class at lower intensity. This indicates that many super active spreaders getting aware of the disease transmission and they stop spreading the infection by isolation. .

Immunotherapy is highly effective initially in hospitalized infected individuals however better results were seen in the long term with plasma therapy.We also suggest certain policies to make sure that plasma therapy is available on a larger scale. The Physician can motivate patients at the time of discharge to donate plasma in the near future (once they are eligible to donate). Furthermore, the government should expand plasma collection capabilities. They need to create infrastructure and remove certain barriers for agencies in order to prioritize collecting plasma and making it available on a larger scale for treatment at subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection.Preliminary data using immunotherapy and plasma therapy against the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases provides an unprecedented opportunity to perform a large-scale randomized clinical trial, to study the efficacy of this treatment against a viral agent. If the results of rigorously conducted investigations demonstrate consistent efficacy, the use of these therapies could help change the course of this pandemic.",
