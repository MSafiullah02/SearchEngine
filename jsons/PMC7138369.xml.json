It provides relatively equitable access to physician and hospital services through 13 provincial and territorial tax-funded public insurance plans.\u2022Like most countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Canada faces an ageing population and fiscal constraints in its publicly funded programmes. Services must be provided across vast geography and in the context of high rates of migration and ethnocultural diversity in Canadian cities.\u2022In 2017, the 150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation, the three key health policy challenges are long waits for some elective health-care services, inequitable access to services outside the core public basket, and sustained poor health outcomes for Indigenous populations.\u2022To address these challenges, a renewal of the tripartite social contract underpinning Medicare is needed. Governments, health-care providers (especially physicians), and the public must recommit to equity, solidarity, and co-stewardship of the system.\u2022To fully achieve the potential of Medicare, action on the social determinants of health and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples must occur in parallel with health system reform.\u2022Without bold political vision and courage to strengthen and expand the country's health system, the Canadian version of universal health coverage is at risk of becoming outdated.\n\n",

When Douglas later became the Social Democratic Premier of Saskatchewan, he implemented universal public health insurance for the province, making it the first jurisdiction with universal health coverage in North America.8 This insurance initially covered hospital care in 1947. It was expanded to medical care (mainly defined as physician services) in 1962. Services were resourced by a provincial tax-financed plan.

Three of these conditions are particularly effective in ensuring some commonality across 13 health systems: portability, universality, and accessibility. Portability allows insured residents to keep their coverage when travelling or moving within Canada.11 Universality stipulates that access must be on uniform terms and conditions\u2014ie, individuals do not have preferential access based on the ability to pay privately. Accessibility means that no user fees are charged for publicly insured services: when a Canadian visits a doctor or is cared for in any department of a hospital, there is no payment or deductible. Provincial and territorial governments have upheld the principles of the Canada Health Act through various laws and policies to ensure ongoing federal funding; currently, federal transfer payments amount to approximately 20% of provincial health budgets.12\nPanel 2Overview of the Canada Health ActThe following criteria and conditions must be met for provinces and territories to receive federal contributions under the Canada Health Transfer.\n\u2022Public administration: plans must be administered and operated on a non-profit basis by a public authority\u2022Comprehensiveness: plans must cover all insured health services provided by hospitals, physicians, or dentists (for surgical dental procedures that require a hospital setting)\u2022Universality: all insured residents must be entitled to the insured health services on uniform terms and conditions\u2022Portability: insured residents moving from one province or territory to another, or temporarily absent from their home province or territory or Canada, must continue to be covered for insured health services (within certain conditions)\u2022Accessibility: not to impede or preclude, either directly or indirectly, whether by user charges or otherwise, reasonable access to insured health services\nAdapted from 9, 10.",

The most important quality of this layer is relatively equitable access to physician and hospital care.16 Another benefit is cost containment: within Canadian publicly funded insurance plans, administrative overhead is extremely low\u2014less than 2%\u2014because of the simplicity of the single-payer scheme.17\n",

The Canadian version is the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), an intergovernmental body that provides evidence-informed funding recommendations as to which drugs and technologies should be publicly covered. However, unlike most international health technology assessment organisations, CADTH's outputs are advisory only. Although regional health plans made coverage decisions consistent with these recommendations in more than 90% of cases between 2012 and 2013, manufacturers must nonetheless navigate 13 provincial and territorial labyrinthine approval processes even after receiving CADTH sanction.32 Furthermore, 85% of private plans provide coverage for all prescriptions, including those that CADTH recommends against, with the result that evidence-informed recommendations do not necessarily cross the public\u2013private divide.34\n",

It called for the expansion of the health-care system beyond disease-based medical care.\n1979\u201380: Health Services Review\nLed by Justice Emmett Hall, this review reported on the progress made since the 1964 commission and sought to determine whether provinces were meeting the criteria of the Medical Care Insurance Act. This inquiry identified widespread extra billing and user fees, and served as a catalyst for the Canada Health Act.\n1991\u201396: Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples\nThe Commission investigated the evolution of the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people and governments in Canada. Major recommendations included the training of 10 000 health professionals over a 10-year period.\n1993\u201397: Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada (Krever Inquiry)Led by Justice Horace Krever, the Commission investigated the use of contaminated blood products that infected 2000 transfusion recipients with HIV and 30 000 with hepatitis C between 1980 and 1990. This Commission led to the creation of Canadian Blood Services in 1998.\n1994\u201397: National Forum on Health\nCommissioned by Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, this group of experts from across Canada focused on broad determinants of health and the need for enhanced emphasis on evidence-based care.\n1999\u20132002: Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology Study on the State of the Health Care System in Canada (Kirby Committee)\nLed by Senator Michael Kirby, this committee conducted a comprehensive review of Canadian health care. Recommendations included a call for enhanced federal oversight to ensure effective care and efficient resource use, and highlighted poor health human resource planning as a cause of geographical inequities.\n2001\u201302: Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada (Romanow Commission)\nLed by former Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow, the Commission called for a renewed commitment to the values of equity, fairness, and solidarity. The report was the catalyst for the 2003 \u201cAccords\u201d and the establishment of the Health Council of Canada (defunded in 2014) to monitor progress on key objectives.\n2003: National Advisory Committee on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Public Health\nLed by David Naylor, this committee was established to review the circumstances of the 2003 SARS outbreak. The report identified significant issues with public health in Canada and led to the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n2008\u201315: Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada\nUndertaken as part of holistic and comprehensive response to the systemic abuse suffered by Indigenous Canadians under the Indian Residential School system, the commission identified calls to action to advance reconciliation. Although not specifically focused on health care, the report highlighted substantial gaps in health care for Indigenous people and outlined the substantial impact of the trauma on mental and physical health.\n2015: Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation\nLed by David Naylor, the panel's Unleashing Innovation report highlighted the need for enhanced patient engagement, workforce modernisation, technological transformation, and improved scale-up of existing innovations.",

Her two previous deliveries were uncomplicated and her pregnancy is considered low risk. On her northern First Nations reserve, primary care services are provided by nurses in the community clinic and supported by a family physician who flies in once a month. The nearest community an hour away has a small hospital, but provides no intrapartum services.Vanessa has access to prenatal care close to home. It is important for her that such care is given within the community, increasing the ease of access and sense of cultural safety. Her medical care and prenatal vitamins are covered through public health insurance plans, as is her transportation to medical appointments outside the reserve. She worries about her partner when she is away, particularly given the deep impact of a cluster of recent suicides in the community that included his teenaged sister. The community is affected by many preventable deaths, including suicides, and trauma, but no births\u2014the circle of life feels incomplete.At 34 weeks' gestation, Vanessa must travel to the city, where she sits in a motel room and waits to go into labour. Neither the timing of the baby's arrival nor the potential complications that can arise can be predicted, so Vanessa waits alone. As for most women in communities like hers, the birth will occur not with a midwife in her community, but in a hospital hundreds of kilometres away from her partner and children, compromising her much-needed sense of cultural safety. Her access to health-care services free at the point of care is critical, but she wishes her care could be connected to her home, her family, and her culture. If these defects in the system are addressed, perhaps Vanessa's next generation will grow up to expect access to such vital, culturally safe health care.\nMahmoud: a migrant health story\nMahmoud is a 52-year-old Syrian dental surgeon who arrived in Canada with his wife and four children in 2016, as a government-sponsored refugee family. The children started public school while both parents enrolled in the government-funded English-language training for the first months of settlement.Despite having publicly funded health insurance immediately on arrival, Mahmoud does not access primary care for himself or his family for many reasons, including discomfort with the English language and a lack of knowledge of where to seek care. When he begins to feel unwell, after stalling for a long time, he goes to a local community clinic. An appointment is given for him to return with interpreter services for the following week.Unfortunately, in the meantime, Mahmoud is admitted to hospital with uncontrolled blood sugars. He is started on oral hypoglycaemics. As a refugee, his medicines are covered, but when he transitions to regular provincial health insurance he will have to pay for his medicines out of pocket.The process associated with recognition of Mahmoud's dental credentials and skills is complex and lengthy. To take care of his family, he takes up taxi driving. With his unpredictable hours, he finds it hard to comply with his prescribed regimen and starts missing follow-up appointments.As the Ramadan period approaches, Mahmoud knows he will fast but does not consult with the health team at the local clinic, unsure whether he would be understood as he does not know how to get an interpreter. Despite the fact that there is an increasing sensitivity to the diversity of the Canadian population by the health-care professionals, who are also becoming increasingly diverse, more work is needed to improve communication and personalisation of care, especially at the primary care level.",

The need for physician engagement, both at the individual and collective level, is crucial as Canada moves to address long wait times for elective care, because solutions so often involve the reorganisation of traditional referral models and the introduction of team-based care. Furthermore, expanded public coverage of prescription medications will necessitate a drive towards more evidence-informed and value-based prescribing. Canadian physicians are well situated to constructively contribute to such efforts to define value and help to shift behaviour. As founders of evidence-based medicine and important contributors to global medical research, Canadian physicians must help to lead the necessary research and debates on change within the health-care system.117 They are critical partners in ensuring quality, consistency, and availability of services.27 Medical associations in at least two provinces have recognised the importance of system stewardship in the practice of professionalism and have committed to health system reform in collaboration with governments.118, 119 The Canadian Medical Association's renewed strategic plan places patients at the core of its mission.120 And leaders in medical education have embraced a social accountability mandate and are actively working to train the \u201cright mix, distribution, and number of physicians to meet societal needs\u201d.121 This approach is a model with potential broad international application.",

Health care is ultimately a local affair, and no patient or provider wants the payer in the examination room. However, much of the potential benefit of a single-payer structure is lost when institutions are independent, with little accountability. The potential of the system is further limited by the fact that physicians function alongside but outside the system, rather than as accountable participants through employment or other contractual means.
