In 1978 the existence of the first eukaryotic DNA helicase was reported in the lily [10]. Since then, several different DNA helicases have been isolated from many organisms from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Recently, a new helicase motif, named the \u2018Q motif\u2019, has been identified in the DEAD\u2010box family of helicases [8].

Helicase partially unwinds duplex DNA substrate (32P\u2010labeled oligonucleotide annealed to a longer ssDNA molecule) yielding two ssDNA molecules of different sizes which are resolved from the starting duplex by electrophoresis followed by autoradiography (Fig. 1). The radioactive label in the DNA permits direct visualization (Fig. 1B) and quantitation of the results. Several other assays have also been developed but are not commonly used: for example, a rapid quench\u2010flow method [13], fluorescence\u2010based assays [14], filtration assay [15], a scintillation proximity assay [16], a time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay [17], an assay based on flashplate technology [18], homogeneous time\u2010resolved fluorescence quenching assay and electrochemiluminescence\u2010based helicase assay [19].

Many helicases need a replication fork\u2010like structure on the substrate for optimum unwinding. Some DNA helicases such as RecBCD, UvrD, Rep and RecQ from E. coli and SV40 large T antigen can also initiate unwinding from the ends of blunt\u2010ended duplex DNA [2]. RecG, RuvA and RuvB helicases of E. coli specifically recognize Holliday junctions [21, 22]. Usually oligomeric helicases carry multiple ssDNA\u2010binding sites, although all the sites may not simultaneously bind to the DNA.

The polarity of unwinding by DNA helicase can usually be determined by using a DNA substrate consisting of a linear ssDNA template with duplex regions near the end(s). Possible structures of substrates that can be used for directional study in vitro are shown in Fig. 2. For helicases involved in DNA replication, the polarity of the reaction is strongly indicative of helicase placement on the leading (3\u2032 to 5\u2032 polarity) or lagging (5\u2032 to 3\u2032 polarity) strands. It has been reported that RecBCD contains bipolar enzyme activitiy, where RecB and RecD components of the complex unwind DNA from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 and 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 directions, respectively [25]. Interestingly, PcrA helicase from Bacillus anthracis showed robust 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 as well as 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 helicase activities, with substrates containing a duplex region and a 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 ss poly(dT) tail [26].

The property of an oligomeric helicase is that it possesses multiple DNA\u2010binding sites, a feature that is required for any \u2018active\u2019 mechanism of DNA unwinding, because it enables a helicase to bind both ss and duplex DNA or two strands of ssDNA simultaneously at an unwinding fork. On the basis of active assembly of DNA helicases, they can be grouped as monomeric or multimeric helicases. Figure 3 shows the interaction of different forms of DNA helicases with a DNA\u2010unwinding fork. In all these models, at least one subunit always binds to the ssDNA track along which it moves [28]. The other subunit may bind to the dsDNA. On the other hand the monomeric helicases may contain two different domains, one for ssDNA and the other for dsDNA binding. The bacterial helicases II, IV and PriA ([1] and references cited therein), bacteriophage T4 Dda helicase [29], human DNA helicase IV, V and VI [5], and pea DNA helicase 45 (PDH45) and PDH65 [30, 31] are the few examples of monomeric forms.

These results show that the hexameric G40P DNA helicase encircles the 5\u2032 tail, interacts with the duplex DNA at the ss/dsDNA junction, and excludes the 3\u2032 tail of the forked DNA [33]. Oligomerization of many DNA helicases can be modulated by interactions with other ligands.

In eukaryotes, Mcm proteins 2\u20137 are required for initiation and elongation steps of chromosomal DNA replication [36]. The Mcm complex is now known to serve as a replicative helicase. A heterotrimeric complex of human Mcm4/6/7 forms a dimeric structure, contains ATP\u2010dependent DNA helicase activity, binds to ssDNA, and possesses DNA\u2010dependent ATPase activity [37], whereas Mcm2/3/7 serve as regulatory subunits. In the presence of forked DNA structures and single stranded DNA binding protein (SSBP), the Mcm4/6/7 complex possesses processive DNA helicase activity [38]. The six proteins (Mcm2\u20137) interact with each other to form multiple complexes; however, the predominant form is a hexamer containing all six Mcms, which is relatively stable. Electron microscopy indicates that this complex has a globular structure. In vivo studies suggest that all six Mcms are recruited to replication origins during the G1 phase [36]. During G1 phase human Mcm proteins first assemble at or adjacent to bound origin recognition complex along with cell division cycle (Cdc) 6 and Cdc10\u2010dependent transcript 1 (Cdt1) proteins (Fig. 4) and move to other sites during genome replication [39]. These proteins together form a prereplication complex at the origin of DNA replication at the beginning of the S phase. After assembly, the complex is activated by cyclin\u2010dependent kinases (CDKs) and the Cdc7\u2013dumb bell former 4 (Cdc7\u2013Dbf4, DDK) complex in the S phase to promote the initiation of DNA replication (Fig. 4).",

Actually the two protein kinases (CDK and DDK) trigger a chain reaction that results in the phosphorylation of the Mcm complex and finally in the initiation of DNA synthesis [36, 39, 40]. Recruitment of DDK to the replication origin occurs during the G1 phase. However, it must function sometimes during the S phase, and this decision is controlled locally at individual origins. Phosphorylation of Mcm2 by DDK results in a conformational change in the Mcm complex. Recruitment of Cdc45 depends on phosphorylation of the Mcm complex and the activity of CDK. The Mcm component of the complex provides the DNA\u2010unwinding function (Fig. 4) to start the DNA replication, which finally requires the concerted action of many enzymes/factors such as replication protein A (RPA), polymerase \u03b1, replication factor C, polymerase \u03b4, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), flap endonuclease 1, endonuclease DNA2, and DNA ligase I [35, 39]. The unwinding of origin DNA is detected only at a later step when the Mcm complex is phosphorylated by DDK at the G1 to S phase transition [40]. These studies suggest an anchoring mechanism other than direct contact with DNA for the Mcm complex immediately after its recruitment to the replication origins. Recently it has been reported that the Mcm8 protein from HeLa cells, a new member of the Mcm family, forms a complex with Mcm4, Mcm6 and Mcm7 proteins and this complex is involved in initiation of DNA replication [41].",

This gene was discovered during a search for genes that control the loss of viability in thymine\u2010starved bacteria, a classic phenomenon known as thymineless death. RecQ1 mutant was resistant to thymineless death, and, in a recBCsbcB background, it exhibited enhanced UV sensitivity and a deficiency in conjugational recombination, suggesting a role for RecQ in the RecF recombination pathway [42].

In general, unicellular organisms express a single RecQ enzyme, whereas more complex organisms express two or more. All helicases of this family share a central seven helicase motifs. RecQ DNA helicases are proposed to function at the interface between DNA replication and recombination to \u2018repair\u2019 the damaged replication forks [44]. This family includes at least five members in humans, and the following three are defective in genetic disorders associated with cancer and/or premature aging: WRN, BLM and RECQ4 helicases defective in Werner's syndrome, Bloom's syndrome, and Rothmud\u2013Thomson syndrome, respectively [44, 45]. RecQ helicases are considered to be \u2018caretaker\u2019 tumor suppressors which suppress neoplastic transformation through control of chromosomal stability [44]. Figure 5 depicts the members of the RecQ family of DNA helicases from humans, Xenopus, Drosophila, yeast and E. coli. The family contains a highly conserved helicase domain which comprises about 400 amino acids. Two signature motifs are present in most RecQ helicases: the RQC domain and HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C\u2010terminal) domain (Fig. 5). The RQC domain is unique to RecQ family helicases and probably has a role in mediating interactions with other proteins. The HRDC domain is found in a number of nucleases that digest RNA, and may be involved in DNA binding in RecQ proteins [45]. The members of this family of helicases can unwind many different kinds of structurally diverse DNA substrates, including G4\u2010DNA (G\u2010quadruplex DNA) and synthetic Holliday junctions. The BLM and WRN proteins have been shown to promote branch migration of bona fide Holliday junctions generated by the RecA protein [46, 47]. Significantly, this RecQ\u2010helicase\u2010catalysed branch migration occurs over several kilobases of DNA, whereas the regular unwinding that is catalysed by these enzymes is only moderately processive and limited to 75\u2013150 bp in the absence of cofactors. This ability to process recombination intermediates formed during DNA replication is proposed to be a key function of the RecQ helicases.",

            "text": "Except for E. coli RecQ, human RECQ5 and RECQL, members of this family are large with extended amino and carboxy ends (Fig. 5). These flanking ends are poorly conserved and are important in functionally distinguishing the roles of the different \u2018isoforms\u2019 in humans. WRN helicase differs from the other family of RecQ helicases in containing exonuclease activity as well. The BLM helicase belongs to the family of ring helicases, which includes SV40 large T antigen and E. coli DnaB and RuvB proteins [47]. BLM makes numerous contacts with other proteins. It is a component of ATM kinase, BASC (BRCA1\u2010associated genome surveillance complex), a multienzyme complex that contains BRCA1 and MLH1, the MRE11\u2013RAD50\u2013NBS1 complex [44]. It has also been shown in a number of studies that WRN interacts physically and functionally with proteins required for DNA replication, including DNA polymerase \u03b4, flap endonuclease 1, PCNA, and RPA [44]. A physical and functional interaction has also been reported for WRN protein and the Ku heterodimer complex, suggesting that WRN protein is also involved in double\u2010strand break repair [48]. The connection between RecQ homologs and Ku appears to be relevant for telomere maintenance as well. It has been shown that primary fibroblasts from patients with Werner's syndrome, like Ku\u2010deficient murine cells, display excessive telomere shortening and premature replicative senescence, which is thought to contribute to the early onset of aging seen in Werner's syndrome [49]. However, yeast Sgs1p is also required for a telomere maintenance pathway that is independent of telomerase and dependent on recombination [50]. Thus the RecQ helicases help to define two mechanically distinct telomere maintenance pathways that are both telomerase\u2010independent and recombination\u2010dependent.",

These findings suggest that RECQ1 and hRPA may also interact in vivo and function together in DNA metabolism [51]. RECQ5 is one of the five RecQ helicase homologs identified in humans. Drosophila RECQ5 helicase is capable of unwinding 3\u2032 Flap, three\u2010way junction, fork and three\u2010strand junction substrates at lower protein concentrations than 5\u2032 Flap, 12 nucleotide bubble and synthetic Holliday junction structures, which can be unwound efficiently by WRN and BLM [52]. Taken together these findings provide evidence that RecQ helicases facilitate smooth \u2018replisome\u2019 progression through the genome. Six cDNAs of RecQ\u2010like proteins (AtRecQI1, AtRecQI2, AtRecQI3, AtRecQI4A, AtRecQI4B and AtRecQsim) and one gene (AtWRNexo) homologous to the exonuclease domain of human Werner protein have also been isolated from plants [53].",

            "text": "The DNA helicases are known to play essential roles in unwinding of duplex strands in almost every aspect of nucleic acid metabolism, which makes them very important molecules. Functional helicases always work as an integrated component of a large macromolecular complex which is \u2018designed\u2019 to carry out a particular function on its genomic DNA target. The functions of all reported DNA helicases have not yet been investigated. It will be important to identify and characterize their specific substrates, interacting proteins, and cofactors in order to precisely elucidate their specific functions in nucleic acid metabolism. Despite the diversity of their functions and the large range of organisms in which these proteins have been identified, high sequence conservation is maintained, suggesting that all helicase genes evolved from a common ancestor. The family of DEAD\u2010box helicases differ mainly in the N\u2010terminal and C\u2010terminal sequences, which contain different targeting signals. The different regulatory mechanisms at both the level of expression and post\u2010transcription may explain the wide spectrum of functions involving DEAD\u2010box helicases. The crystal structures of DNA helicases suggest that the helicase motifs are clustered together for the overall unwinding function. The motifs, crystal structure, mechanism of unwinding, and various functions of DNA helicases are described in detail in the following review.",

            "text": "The Mcm proteins play an important role in replication by acting as licensing factors, ensuring that replication is not re\u2010initiated until the first round is completed in one cell cycle. These proteins initiate unwinding at the origin, leading to the formation of a replication bubble. They create a replication fork and move along the fork, at the same time bringing the origin to the unlicensed state. The conservation of Mcms from Archaea to humans suggests that several of these proteins may have evolved from a single progenitor. Helicases of the RecQ family catalyse critical genome maintenance reactions in bacterial and eukaryotic cells, playing key roles in several DNA metabolic processes. Mutations in RecQ genes are linked to genome instability and human disease. As mutants in RecQ family genes have unstable chromosomes, it was proposed that members of the RecQ helicase family play a central role in the maintenance of genomic stability and thereby the prevention of tumorigenesis. A connection between the action of RecQ homologs and gene expression was demonstrated by the involvement of QDE3 of Neurospora crassa in post\u2010transcriptional gene silencing [54]. However, only one RecQ homolog was found in E. coli and yeast genomes, but multiple homologs are found in the animal and plant kingdom. These homologs of RecQ seem to have evolved first by duplication and then by consecutive shuffling or fusion with other protein domains [54]. Careful genomic studies and further biochemical analysis are needed to understand fully how RecQ DNA helicases influence the processing and/or prevention of recombination intermediates.",

Considering the multiplicity of helicases, their tissue specificity, functional diversity, and control of activity by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, it is reasonable to assume that they also play an important role in cell division, growth, and development. Progress in plant helicases is slow. A better understanding of these proteins will have to await the breakthrough that hopefully will be provided by the high\u2010resolution structure to be solved by X\u2010ray crystallography. Furthermore, the RNAi approach and/or transgenic antisense plant technology should help in understanding the detailed role of helicases in plant development.",
