SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus and has 79.5% identity to SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its host entry receptor.2 The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include pneumonia, diarrhea, dyspnea, and multiple organ failure. Interestingly, lymphocytopenia, as a diagnostic indicator, is common in COVID-19 patients. Xiong et al. found upregulation of apoptosis, autophagy, and p53 pathways in PBMC of COVID-19 patients.3 Some studies reported that lymphocytopenia might be related to mortality, especially in patients with low levels of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes.4,5 Lymphocytopenia was also found in the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases. MERS-CoV can directly infect human primary T lymphocytes and induce T-cell apoptosis through extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, but it cannot replicate in T lymphocytes.6 However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also infect T cells, resulting in lymphocytopenia.",

To accomplish this, pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were packaged based on methods described previously.7 The pseudoviruses could infect permissive cells (293T/ACE2 and Huh7 cells) expressing the ACE2 receptor, but could not infect nonpermissive cells (HeLa cells) (Fig. 1a). We used pseudovirus with equal infectivity to 293T/ACE2 cells (Fig. 1c) to infect two T lymphocyte cell lines, MT-2 and A3.01, with very low, or close to negative, expression level of hACE2 mRNA (Fig. 1b). Surprisingly, over several replicates, we saw that the T-cell lines were significantly more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with SARS-CoV (Fig. 1c). In other words, these results tell us that T lymphocytes may be more permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and less permissive for SARS-CoV infection, similar to the findings in a previous study.6 Therefore, it is plausible that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 might mediate potent infectivity, even on cells expressing low hACE2, which would, in turn, explain why the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is so high. It is also possible that other receptors mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into T cells, such as CD147, present on the surface of T lymohocytes,8 which was recently reported to be a novel invasive route for SARS-CoV-2.9",

            "text": "To assess if SARS-CoV-2 enters T lymphocytes through non-receptor-mediated endocytosis, we used EK1 peptide which has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) mediated cell\u2013cell fusion and pseudovirus infection.7,10 Specifically, it inhibits receptor-mediated infection by interacting with HR1 to block the formation of the six-helix bundle (6-HB), further inhibiting fusion between viral and target cell membranes. We found that the EK1 peptide had significant inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses on MT-2 cells (Fig. 1d), suggesting that virus entry depends on receptor-mediated fusion. However, only a high concentration (40 \u03bcM) of EK1 had inhibitory activity on MT-2 cells. Meanwhile, the IC50 value of EK1 was 2.38 \u03bcM on 293T/ACE2 cells.10 These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can also enter T lymphocytes through the receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway. To clarify, we performed a SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion assay according to previous studies.7,10 After 48 h of coculture, 293T cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein fused with MT-2 cells. Compared with unfused cells, the fused cells clustered together and appeared as a large faint green fluorescent mass. In contrast, no fused cells were found in the SARS-CoV coculture (Fig. 1e). Therefore, it can be concluded that SARS-CoV-2 might infect T cells through S protein-mediated membrane fusion.",

The number of viral genome copies at 6 h was significantly higher than other time points in the cell lysate, but always remained steady at all time points in the supernatants. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may enter MT-2 cells at 6 h post infection, but does not replicate, and then the viral RNA degrade.

However, we observed a very low expression level of hACE2 in T cells; therefore, we further proposed that a novel receptor might mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry into T cells. Similar to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infection of T cells is abortive. A recent study reported that viral reads barely displayed in PBMC samples from COVID-19 patients through transcriptome sequencing of RNAs. Thus, it was inferred that SARS-CoV-2 could not infect PBMCs. However, the transcriptomic characteristics of PBMCs were detected and analyzed from three patients. Two SARS-CoV-2 reads were detected in one patient\u2019s PBMCs, and zero reads in another.3 This result could be attributed to nonproductive replication of SARS-CoV-2 in T lymphocytes, with little viral genome in PBMCs possibly degrading in the sample collection and RNA extraction process. Thus, the questions of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in primary T cells and whether the infection induces apoptosis in T cells still need further research, potentially evoking new ideas about pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.",
