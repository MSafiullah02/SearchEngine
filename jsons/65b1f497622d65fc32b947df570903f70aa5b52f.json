The obtained simple analytical ratios allow estimating the factors determining the intensity of the infection spread, including changing requirements for quarantine severity. The presented method of forecasting allows to calculate both the total number of infected persons and the number of active infections. Comparison of the results of calculations according to the proposed model with the statistics for a number of cities shows their satisfactory qualitative and quantitative compliance. The proposed simple model can be useful in preliminary assessment of possible consequences of changing quarantine conditions.",

The numerous coefficients of these models are selected by comparing the results of calculations with observations of the spread of the epidemic found in different countries or individual cities. Under conditions of various measures, including isolation of disease carriers by quarantine or other sanitary measures, there is a need to assess the effectiveness of these restrictive measures. Thus, it becomes vital to develop a simple model, which allows to quickly assess the effectiveness of the strategy to combat the uncontrolled spread of the epidemic. It should be understood that the modeling of the spread of the epidemic should be carried out under conditions of low reliability of information on the number of infected persons, due to the fact, in particular, that the results of observations depend to a large extent on the quantity and quality of the tests for the presence of the disease.",

It can be noted that statistics on the number of infected persons for different countries is extremely unreliable, as it depends on the volume of testing. This can be seen especially well from the analysis of data for Moscow [5] , where the number of established infections has increased sharply only about 30 to 40 days after the official beginning of the epidemic. According to official information, during this period the number of tests in Moscow doubled. The number of tests is particularly low and therefore there was a low level of infection with the virus detected in the early stages of the epidemic. As reliable information on the spread of the epidemic accumulate, the choice of model coefficients will become more and more reasonable. The unreliability of the information became apparent, in particular, in the calculation of the coefficient k for Moscow; this coefficient should have been about 0.54 (i.e., the same as for New York) and, accordingly, the number of infected persons, according to the predicted calculations, would have increased to about 120000.",

The results of the prognostic calculations show that for the Berlin context, the maximum daily increase in the number of infected patients is about 40 days after the quarantine attenuation. If the number of infected patients can be expected to double compared to the number of patients under strict quarantine, the daily maximum increase in the number of infected patients will reach over 150 per day. It is calculated that a new stationary regimen (i.e. a total of about 14000 infected patients) could be expected after about four months. However, after three months it would be possible to produce a secondary quarantine easing. In case of quarantine weakening, a more successful quarantine strategy could be used, leaving mainly the persons in the so-called risk zone in the hard quarantine. For this purpose, first of all, it would be necessary to weaken the quarantine for residents who are not in the socalled risk group. However, it is necessary to bear in mind that the risk group may include not only the elderly, but also young citizens and even children with a certain set of diseases. But such a strategy will require mass testing and analysis of the health status of a large number of citizens and, most importantly, a reliable determination of the number of persons with resistance to disease. In addition to analyzing the total number of people infected with the virus, information on the number of active patients, i.e. actually infected patients, is equally important, taking into account their cure. The calculation of these so-called active patients was performed on the basis of a ratio (4). The period of time after which it can be expected that the number of active infections begins to decrease is, when the so-called 0 \u2264 1 can be determined from the ratio (4). The infection rate 0 is the parameter that controls the number of new infections in a certain moment given the number of infected people in the days before. For 0 \u2264 1 the infection curve becomes flat and the epidemics is controlled.",

According to some preliminary data, the number of such persons who were immune after asymptomatic or mild disease may be 5-10 times greater than the number of statistically recorded infections, therefore the relative resistance to coronavirus may reach 70-80% [7] . a. The value of the locality for which the forecast is made: Preliminary data obtained by us show that the value of this coefficient increases with population growth. b. Population groups: these groups can be divided by age, social origin, and ethnic composition. There is abundant evidence of varying degrees of epidemic prevalence among children, middle-aged people and the elderly. Statistics also show an increased risk of disease for weaker social groups, which may be due to both higher rates of violations of certain health standards in these groups and more serious health problems. c. Vaccination rates in the population: Some data show that vaccination against other viruses, which was mandatory, particularly in Eastern European countries, may have helped to reduce the spread of coronavirus COVID -19. d. Climatic characteristics: Preliminary studies carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) [9] show, inter alia, that with increasing temperatures and decreasing absolute humidity, the intensity of the epidemic decreases. e. Special attention should be paid to analysing the impact of long-term epidemics on the psychological state of the population: It should be noted that even a relatively short period of the epidemic (about 3 months) has sharply increased the risk of stress and depression [8] . Therefore, when choosing an optimal strategy to combat the epidemic, one should also take into account the possible worsening of mental diseases and the impact of long-term quarantine on them. In this regard, it would be essential to perform an analysis of the risk of developing mental illness both in conditions of long-term quarantine and active epidemic development without the use of severe quarantine restrictions. f.

A simple model has been developed to quickly forecast the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic under quarantine and other preventive measures aimed at drastically reducing the number of infections. 2. Comparison of results of calculations by the proposed model with statistical data showed satisfactory qualitative and quantitative agreements. 3. The model uses two main empirical parameters determining the intensity of the epidemic spread: the contact intensity coefficient k determining the population infection dynamics and the contact restriction or infection effect reduction coefficient as a result of different sanitary and epidemiological measures \u03bb. 4. The use of this model as a tool for further numerical experiments allows to estimate the timelines and effectiveness of measures to reduce the spread of the epidemic. For example, the model can be used to calculate the number of infected citizens in New York City under the hypothetical condition that quarantine would have been introduced earlier than it happened in reality. 5. The most important factor determining the further quarantine exit strategy is the information about the potential number of persons who have already received immunity against the virus. Reliable information can only be obtained through mass testing of the population. There is currently no critical information on the number of people who may have developed immunity to the",

At the same time, it would be useful to use a more detailed model with separate predictions for different population groups and the possibility to forecast the number of severe diseases and the death rate. 7. The use of the proposed model makes it possible to quickly assess the consequences of planned measures for partial or complete removal of quarantine restrictions or introduction of new restrictions. 8. Further improvement of the model, first of all, should be carried out in the direction of clarifying the coefficient k and determining the change of its values depending on it:",
