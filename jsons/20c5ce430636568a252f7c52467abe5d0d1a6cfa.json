Both of these techniques have advantages. The choice between them brings inlo question our concepts of the degree of coloniality shown by graptoloids. Using a whole colony model. graptoloids can be shown to have sampled the water with variable efficiency. as defined in this paper. Planar forms were relatively inefficient, generally sampling less than 10% of the available waler. Inclined forms frequently approached 75% efficiency. Biserial forms and slrdight monograptids roulinely exceeded 100%. sampling each unit of water more lhan once. Rotation of the rhabdosome during movement increased the efficiency of horizontal and inclined forms. It reduced the efficiency of scandent biserials and straight monograptids. These were bolh advantageous effects. Aslogenetic changes in colony size and form would have had a profound effect on feeding efficiency. 0",

Rotation has been suggested to have occurred by a number of authors (Bulman 1964; Kirk 1969; Lenz 1974; Williams 1981 ) for a diverse range of graptoloids. The reasons given for rotation vary from current generation to the passive response of the colony to water movement. In this paper all graptoloids are assumed to have been capable of rotation. This may prove to be incorrect for some species but seems a reasonable assumption in most cases. The rates of rotation observed in models of graptoloids were used as the starting point for a consideration of the effects of rotation on the colony. However, they were not the only rates considered. Mathematical models are used here to calculate feeding parameters and to simulate the effect of rotation on a variety of rhabdosome shapes. Mathematical modelling has the advantage of allowing the effects of different rates of rotation to be investigated. It is also much faster than building physical models. However, no account can be taken yet of factors such as water currents and changes in the rate of vertical movement with time. The detailed soft part morphology and metabolic rates of the graptoloid zooid remain speculative.",

It is possible also that the mere presence of soft parts would have aided rotation in some way, if only making the \"ribbon'-like crosssection of the stipes more pronounced. Until some means of more tightly estimating these rates of movement and rotation is available, it is considered preferable to consider the effect of a range of rotation rates on colony morphology. For the study described here, those rates were O\"/m, 86.5\"/m (the average rate of rotation obseived in the models [Rigby & Previous work on graptoloid feeding strategies Previous work on this subject is scarce. Some preliminary results of rotation on feeding have been described (Rigby & Rickards 1989) and observations about the distribution of feeding patterns through time are emerging (Rigby 1991) . Horizontal, multiramous graptoloids have been compared to paradigmic harvesting arrays (Fortey & Bell 1987) , a view which is to some extent challenged here. Williams ( 1981) suggested that the spiralling of thecae about the stipe of many dicellograptids was advantageous for food gathering as it maintained all the zooids in the outside of the colony. Berry er al. (1987) suggested that Early Ordovician graptoloids lived in highly productive seas, gathering food from the surrounding water. Scandent graptoloids evolved in response to a scavenging mode, catching particles of food as they fell from above. Uniserial colonies are interpreted as being able to actively seek out food by daily migrations into the photic zone, from the denitrification zone where they lived. These ideas, though imaginative, are totally untestable.",

This value can be compared then to the amount of water available for it to have fed from. This is taken to be the volume of a I-m tall cylinder with a basal diameter equivalent to that of the rhabdosome in question. In all cases conventional orientations for the different species are assumed. In order to compare these, an estimate was required of the feeding area of a single graptoloid zooid. As most thecae are spaced at 10 per cm (Rigby 1991), a feeding circle of 1 mm diameter was assumed for zooids in each thecae. This is to some extent arbitrary as the exact nature of the zooid feeding apparatus remains unknown. It could well have been directional as in modern pterobranchs (Lester 1985) . However, this value has the merit of being plausible and simple to use. It can be modified as our knowledge increases, such modification resulting in a shift of all results rather than a relative change between them. The test set A test set of graptoloids was needed with exhibited the morphological range of the group. A general test set was chosen from Elles and Wood ( 1901 -18) that was considered to exhibit the overall range of morphology. The 10 species chosen are illustrated in Fig. I . Using published drawings rather than specimens, one runs the risk of the scale being wrong. Forty specimens illustrated by Elles and Wood (1901-18) and held in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge, were chosen at random.

However, the pattern of dichotomy is such that there are relatively few branches distally where the benefit from rotation is greatest. In this case a combination of colony size (in terms of diameter) and frequency of branches contributes to the increased effect of rotation on sampling. Terragraprus headi (Fig. 3B ) also would have showed a marked increase in feeding path of its distal zooids with rotation. At 200\"/m the four distal zooids could have sampled about 50% more water than they would have sampled without rotation (a total of 5.9 m per metre fall as opposed to 4 m per metre fall without rotation). This species has four stipes which show no further dichotomies away from the proximal end. However, they are very long (about 0.25111) which would have caused their distal ends to benefit markedly from rotation.",

Those which would have benefited most within this group would have been large diameter individuals with mainly, and many, distal dichotomies. In terms of their feeding efficiency, these forms would have scored low, even when their stipes were closely packed. It seems that any regular pattern of dichotomies cannot fill a circle efficiently, especially if growth - (r Wl) can occur only at the distal tips with limited later infilling. A greater feeding efficiency would have been possible in species with inclined stipes, especially when the inclination was at a high angle or the stipes curved around each other (e. g. D. ziczac) . These forms would have approached the maximum efficiency possible without repetitive sampling of some parts of the water column in calculations based on rotation rates of 500\"/m. Scandent biserial forms and straight monograptids probably would not have benefited from rotation at all in terms of increases in the volume of water that they sampled. Instead they appear to have faced an inverse problem. In the following argument a vertical orientation and vertical movement are assumed.",

Even if this water was saturated with food, and allowing for a degree of horizontal drift, and even for some thecae being empty at any one time, it is hard to imagine how this could have been feasible. Rotation would have allowed the number of times a unit of water was sampled to have been reduced. For M . priodon it would have been reduced to around 10 times at a rotation rate of 360\"/m. Ideally, perhaps, a colony such as this would have rotated 360\" each time it fell its own length. Sampling of all the water would then have occurred only once. However, for this specimen of M . priodon this would have meant rotating 360\" every 0.16 m, or 2222\"/m, a value two orders of magnitude higher than was observed in physical models (Rigby & Rickards 1989) , albeit models of different graptolite morphologies. I consider rotation of this order to have been unlikely. Perhaps then M . priodon lived in an environment where food was 10 times more abundant than that in which D. ziczac lived.",

As such, it would have been a common stratcgy throughout the Ordovician and Silurian. The same is true for the strategy employed by group 3 species, which includes a wide range of forms. Group 2 strategy was only recorded in Ordovician graptoloids, but this could easily be a case of selection bias in the chosen sample. It is possible that some spiral monograptids achieved a constancy of feeding efficiency with growth, although the pattern was almost certainly rarer after the Ordovician-Silurian boundary extinction event than before. It is surely significant that such diverse shapes of graptoloid conform to so few patterns of astogenetic change. Clearly the early growth stages of members of groups 1 and 3 would have had very different feeding requirements to the later astogenetic stages of the same colony. In the case of group I members, the early food requirement would have been lower than that of the later stages; in the case of group 3 members it would have been higher. It seems likely that early and late growth stages of these colonies would need to have lived either spatially or temporally separated form one another.
