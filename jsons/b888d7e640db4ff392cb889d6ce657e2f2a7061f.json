DExD/H-box helicase 60 (DDX60) has been suggested to promote RIG-I-dependent (and potentially also MDA5-dependent) antiviral interferon and ISG induction, although conflicting results have been reported in DDX60-knockout cells and mice [139] [140] [141] . Riplet, which is one of the E3 ligases mediating RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitylation, was recently shown to promote RIG-I signalling in a ubiquitylation-independent manner. It was suggested that by forming a dimer and by crossbridging RIG-I filaments on longer RNA molecules, Riplet induces higher-assembly aggregates of RIG-I 110 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1759, "end": 1764, "text": "[139]", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1770, "text": "[140]", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1776, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1206, "end": 1214, "text": "(fiG. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Nature reviews | Immunology"}, {"text": "Recently, several regulatory proteins for TRIM25 have been identified and functionally characterized. The kinase NDR2 (also known as serine/threonineprotein kinase 38-like (STK38L)) was shown to be crucial for TRIM25-mediated and RIG-I-mediated antiviral interferon responses, evidenced by the impairment of antiviral cytokine induction when NDR2 was gene-edited in cells (in particular, macrophages) and in mice. Interestingly, the kinase activity of NDR2 was shown to be dispensable for its positive effect on RIG-I signalling. Using cell-based assays and in vitro experiments with recombinant RIG-I and TRIM25 proteins, this study showed that NDR2, through interaction with both RIG-I and TRIM25, stabilized their complex formation and promoted TRIM25-induced K63-linked ubiquitylation of the RIG-I CARDs 142 . Ting and colleagues recently unveiled a novel regulatory mechanism that interconnects the RLR and NOD-like receptor (NLR) pathways. The pyrin-containing NLR member, NLRP12, which is expressed predominantly in dendritic cells and neutrophils, was shown to dampen cytokine responses by RIG-I following RNA virus infection or 5\u2032-PPP RNA stimulation, evidenced by higher innate immune signalling in NLRP12-deficient bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. This study further showed that, under normal conditions, NLRP12 interacts with TRIM25, blocking its ability to ubiquitylate and activate RIG-I. At the same time, NLRP12 enhanced the K48-linked ubiquitylation of RIG-I by RNF125, thereby destabilizing RIG-I. During the course of viral infection, however, NLRP12 protein abundance is gradually reduced, relieving the TRIM25-inhibitory mechanism and, at the same time, stabilizing RIG-I 143 . Caspase 12, a negative regulator of inflammasome signalling, was shown to be required for type I interferon induction in response to West Nile virus infection in vitro and in vivo by interacting with RIG-I and regulating its K63-linked ubiquitylation by TRIM25 (ref. 144 ).

Moreover, some triM proteins modulate signal transduction downstream of the interferon\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (iFNar) and, thereby, the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (isGs) 198 . Conceptually, the aminoterminal riNG domain of triM proteins confers e3 ligase activity for ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins (for example, suMO or isG15), allowing modification of either innate sensors or their downstream signalling proteins. Many triM proteins, including triM25 and triM56, modify innate sensor or signalling proteins with non-degradative polyubiquitin types, in particular K63-linked polyubiquitylation 112, 201 . K63-polyubiquitin can prompt or stabilize the multimeric, active form of innate signalling proteins, and/or facilitate the recruitment of other proteins into the complex, ultimately stimulating antiviral signalling and cytokine induction 92, 128 . Other triM proteins have been shown to dampen pattern-recognition receptor-mediated signalling through catalysis of classical K48-linked polyubiquitin, which triggers substrate degradation by the proteasome 198 . Of note, the expression of many triM proteins in humans is transcriptionally induced by interferons 202 , indicating that these proteins are part of a positive feedforward regulatory circuit. Degradative and non-degradative ubiquitylation by triM proteins is reversed by specific deubiquitylating enzymes, which is ultimately crucial for immune homeostasis.

Biochemical characterization showed that lnc-Lsm3b interacts with the CTD of RIG-I, competing with RNA agonists for RIG-I binding.
