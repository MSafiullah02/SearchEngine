In this population, alternative modalities of vaccination have been evaluated such as the use of a second dose of vaccine, which allows an enhanced humoral response in some studies [7], [13], [14], [15], and only marginal effect in others [16]. Moreover, in 2009, the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus has prompted the use of oil-in-water-emulsion adjuvant to enhance influenza vaccine immunogenicity [17]. Therefore, the French Health Authorities recommended the use of two doses of the adjuvanted pandemic influenza A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine in allogeneic HSCT recipients [18].",

To further evaluate the effect of these vaccination modalities, we compared the humoral response observed after adjuvanted vaccination to that observed after influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus infection in HSCT patients included retrospectively. The primary objective was to compare humoral response observed after vaccination by 2 doses of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 adjuvanted vaccine and natural infection in allogeneic HSCT recipients.",

At the beginning of the 2009 influenza pandemia, it was expected that two doses of adjuvanted vaccine would be necessary to induce a substantial humoral response even in immunocompetent subjects, but a single injection was subsequently shown to be sufficient [30]. By contrast, in different types of immunocompromised patients, several studies reported that second injection was necessary to achieve antibody titers comparable to those obtained in control subjects after one injection [31], [32]. In the present study, HSCT recipients were planned to receive the 2 doses of vaccine recommended by the French guidelines and the recent guidelines of the 4th ECIL [18], [33]. The significant increase of specific antibody titer between the first and the second administration of adjuvanted vaccine highly suggests the interest of the second dose of vaccine. However, the design of this study cannot totally exclude a delayed response to the first vaccination. Furthermore, we showed that the response was durable since 17 out 21 patients remained seroprotected after 6 months. Of note, long-term humoral immunity induced by influenza vaccine in HSCT recipients had not been previously evaluated.",

Only a few studies compared the humoral immune response induced by influenza vaccination or natural infection and they were conducted in immunocompetent subjects [35], [36], [37]. Herein we show that the seroprotection rate, as well as the GMT of antibodies at day 42 and even at M6 were not statistically different between infected and vaccinated patients, suggesting that a regimen of two doses of adjuvanted vaccine is as efficient as natural infection in inducing specific humoral response in HSCT patients. Moreover, there is a tendency, although not significant, toward higher GMT at long term in vaccinated patients as previously reported in non-HSCT recipients [36]. To our knowledge, our data are the first showing that the humoral response after vaccination is at least as good as the response induced by natural infection in HSCT recipients and argue for the use of 2 doses of adjuvanted vaccines in these patients.",

For the analysis of factors influencing the humoral response to influenza, we considered the 79 patients as a single group and vaccination or infection as a variable factor. In multivariate analysis, our data showed that the humoral response is independent of the type of influenza immunization (i.e. natural infection or adjuvanted vaccine) but depends on several other parameters: time interval between transplantation and vaccination/infection, treatment by immunosuppressive drugs, presence of chronic GVHD at inclusion. These results must be considered when establishing a new schedule of vaccination in such immunocompromised patients. As previously reported the total lymphocyte counts were associated with the seroprotection rate, in univariate analysis [14]. However this association did not remain in the multivariate analysis. This can be explained because lymphocyte count highly depends on administration of immunosuppressive treatment.",
