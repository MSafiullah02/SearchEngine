While the situation remains dynamic, we believe this analysis has the potential to uncover certain underlying trends. We primarily intend the results to drive further, more detailed analysis of the relevant data by other researchers that would help us gather a better understanding of the situation, aiding our preparedness. Our observations show that countries in high latitudes, with temperate and/or continental climate, and with reasonably \"open\" economies are the most vulnerable to this outbreak.",

The situation remains dynamic and fluid, with the number of cases and number of deaths doubling almost every seven days now. In lieu of such conditions, we present here some quick analysis performed on the number of cases in different countries and regions, as related to economic and geographic indicators. We understand that the situation is very dynamic and is changing daily, and the analyses presented will need an update nearly every hour; present analyses are based on the number of cases from March 23, 2020. But we still believe that some trends found in our analysis will remain and may lead to some general conclusions.",

The seeming relation with GDP may be related to the country's interaction with the international community through trade and other forms of economic exchange. Higher avenues of exchange -including that of citizens -is likely to increase the chances of secondary outbreaks. The same idea is also illustrated by dividing the countries into OBOR (golden) and non-OBOR members (blue). As part of China's OBOR initiative, a country is likely to have much higher economic interaction with China. The gradual increase with per capita GDP seems to peak around 40,000-60,000 International dollars, and has been highlighted by an encasing circle. At the two extreme ends, there are two different phenomena. With very high per capita GDP, it is hypothesized that countries are able to better care for their citizens, reducing the number of infections. At the other extreme, countries with low GDP are likely to have minimal interaction with the world economy, providing them a degree of insulation from large outbreaks.",
