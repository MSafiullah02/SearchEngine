Businesses in some industries (e.g., retail, airlines, hospitality, sports, events) have been immediately affected by the reduction in revenue. Students that were planning careers in these fields might expect long waits or the need to pivot in other directions. Most small to medium businesses have few cash reserves. Despite governmental assistance, this crisis will lead to the bankruptcy of several companies leading to bleak economic prospects for the current batch of graduates. However, businesses that are digitally transformed and are well suited to the rigors of home delivery have done exceptionally well during this time (notably, Amazon).",

The IT infrastructure of the university usually establishes the architecture that enables programs. Schools within the university may not have the discretion to develop a radically different identity. Covid-19 has provided an innovative stimulus whose potential will be constrained by diminishing budgets due to decreased enrollments, shifting government subsidies, reduced ability to sustain high tuitions and lower endowment payouts due to the market downturn. These two moderators will exert considerable influence in limiting the extent of the transformation of the business school. The physical infrastructure in most college campuses has been put in place keeping face-to-face programs in mind and, therefore, are likely to be divested to some degree as online learning accelerates.",
