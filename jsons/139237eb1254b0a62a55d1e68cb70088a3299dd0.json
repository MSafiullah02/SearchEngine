Four TaqMan \u00ae probes were synthesized, targeting at the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and coat protein (CP) genes of both viruses. The reporter dye FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) was used to label the 5% terminus of probes specific to CymMV, while TET (tetrachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein) was used for the ORSV probes. TAMRA (6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine), which was attached at the 3% terminus of each probe, was used as the universal quencher. With increasing amounts of standard RNA templates, the respective threshold cycle (C T ) values were determined and a linear relationship was established between these C T values and the logarithm of initial template amounts.

To date, the TaqMan \u00ae fluorogenic system has been applied for the detection and quantitation of pathogens such as potato leaf roll virus (Schoen et al., 1996) , feline coronaviruses (Gut et al., 1999) , hepatitis C and B viruses (Mercier et al., 1999) , varicella zoster virus (Hawrami and Breuer, 1999) and mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae (Bohm et al., 1999) . This system is also applicable for the monitoring of gene expression. Examples of such genes include the Na + /I \u2212 symporter gene in human thyroid tumours (Lazar et al., 1999) and the MYC gene in sporadic breast tumours (Bieche et al., 1999) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 641, "end": 662, "text": "(Schoen et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 686, "end": 704, "text": "(Gut et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 733, "end": 755, "text": "(Mercier et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 781, "end": 807, "text": "(Hawrami and Breuer, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 845, "end": 864, "text": "(Bohm et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1042, "text": "(Lazar et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1108, "text": "(Bieche et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The TaqMan \u00ae probe design employs an energy transfer effect between matched fluorescent dyes known as the F\u00f6 rster resonance energy transfer through space or FRET (F\u00f6 rster, 1948) . With FRET, light energy absorbed by a high-energy chromophore is transferred to a nearby chromophore of lower energy subject to certain geometric and spectroscopic constraints, the most important of which is the distance between the two chromophores. In the fluorogenic 5% nuclease assay, the probes are labelled with two fluorescent dyes. One dye acts as a 'reporter' and the other acts as a 'quencher'. The reporter transfers fluorescent energy to the quencher by FRET when they are in close proximity. Signal is generated when the hybridised oligo probe is cleaved by the DNA polymerase and the dyes are separated. This separation negates FRET effects and the fluorescent signal emitted by the reporter dye increases. The performance of the TaqMan \u00ae probes depends on the efficiency of reporter dye quenching, probe hybridisation; and probe cleavage by the Taq DNA polymerase (Livak et al., Fig. 3 .

To facilitate efficient reporter dye quenching, the optimal probe length is between 20 and 30 nt. Probes longer than 30 nt risk forming interor intra-molecular structures that interfere with probe synthesis, flexibility, hybridisation, cleavage, as well as amplification process. Hence, the CymMV and ORSV probes selected for the fluorogenic assay are between 20 and 30 nt in length. For efficient hybridisation, the T m of a probe should be higher than that of the RT-PCR primers used. This is because primer-template hybrids are stabilised quickly as they are extended by the polymerase; whereas, the fluorogenic probe is not extended and therefore not stabilised. The higher T m compensates for their relative instability. The recommended T m of the probe is 70\u00b0C and the compatible RT-PCR primers should have a T m approximately 10\u00b0C lower. Thus, the T m of CymMV and ORSV probes were designed to be about 10\u00b0C higher than that of the primers. In addition, the 3% terminus of the probe is phosphorylated to prevent extension by the polymerase during the polymerization steps.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our experiments, the 300/900 nM F/R primer concentration was chosen although the 900/900 and 900/300 nM F/R primer concentrations yielded the highest average DR n values. In a RT-PCR reaction, the reverse transcriptase utilises only the reverse primer to synthesise the cDNA strand while the subsequent PCR amplification of the cDNA utilises equal amounts of forward and reverse primers. This results in a higher net loss of reverse primers and explains why the 300/900 nM F/R primer concentration exhibited higher repeatability and stability than that of the other two F/R primer concentrations. The unincorporated forward primers in the 900/ 900 and 900/300 nM F/R primer concentrations probably contributed to background fluorescence, widening the gap of the amplification plots.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The parameter C T is defined as the cycle number at which the reporter fluorescence, generated by the cleavage of the probe, crosses a fixed threshold value level above the baseline fluorescence emission (Bassam et al., 1996) . The higher the starting copy number of nucleic acid target, the fewer the amplification cycles needed before a significant increase in fluorescence was observed and the lower the C T value. C T values indicate precise and reproducible quantification measurements because they are obtained at a stage in the reaction where reagents are not limiting. Data collected beyond the calculated C T is not considered for quantification purposes. Compared with quantification using endpoint measurements such as competitive RT-PCR, calculating C T s greatly expands the dynamic range of quantification. It was shown above that it is possible to attain a range of five orders of magnitude in starting copy number. As little as 10 4 copies or 5 fg each of CymMV and ORSV can be detected simultaneously with either the RdRp or CP gene as the target.
