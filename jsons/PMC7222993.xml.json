Many species of Mycoplasma are clinically important in veterinary medicine, because they cause a range of diseases in animals including respiratory infection, mastitis, conjunctivitis, arthritis and abortion (McAuliffe et al. 2004). Mycoplasmas are responsible for huge economic losses in production animals worldwide particularly in the dairy industry as a cause of mastitis, and in intensive livestock industries primarily as respiratory pathogens. For example in Europe, the losses attributed to respiratory disease in cattle caused by Mycoplasma bovis are estimated to be \u20ac576 million per year. In the USA, this organism causes losses of approximately 32 million USD per year due to the loss of the weight gain and the reduced carcass value (Sur\u00fdnek et al. 2016). It seems that the losses due to mastitis caused by M. bovis are higher than those due to respiratory disease in which the loss of milk production due to mastitis is estimated to be $108 million per year in the USA (McAuliffe et al. 2004).",

            "text": "Recently, some bacterial isolates, including Mycoplasma, Listeria, Brucella, Lactobacillus, Pasteurella and Staphylococcus have been identified successfully using HRM analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (Miller et al. 2015, Zahidi et al. 2015, Ren et al. 2017). This approach has also been used for both speciation and strain typing of Mycoplasma (Ghorashi et al. 2010; Al-Farha et al. 2018). In one study, a RTPCR-HRM assay was used to identify Mycoplasma species isolated from ruminant, avian and canine origin samples. It was able to distinguish M. arginini, M. bovigenitalium, M. bovis, M. bovirhinis, M. canadense, M. cynos, M. spumans, M. iowae, M. meleagridis and M. agalactiae reference strains (Rebelo et al. 2011). In another study, RTPCR-HRM was used to discriminate between Mycoplasma spp. and Acholeplasma laidlawii isolated from bovine milk samples from mastitic dairy cows. By this approach, five different mollicutes, including A. laidlawii, M. arginini, M. bovirhinis, M. bovis and uncultured Mycoplasma were differentiated (Al-Farha et al. 2018). Ghorashi et al. 2010 also differentiated Mycoplasma gallisepticum strains using PCR and high-resolution melting curve analysis (Ghorashi et al. 2010). In a study conducted by Hashemi et al. 2018, high-resolution melting-curve analysis on pvpA gene was applied for detection and classification of Mycoplasma gallisepticum strains (Hashemi et al. 2018). Landolt et al. 2019 also developed a new high-resolution melting (HRM) assay for identification and differentiation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex samples (Landolt et al. 2019). In this study, we used this approach to discriminate between Mycoplasma species isolated from bovine and porcine respiratory disease from different farms in South Australia. It was able to discern different Mycoplasma species including M. bovis, M. hyosynoviae, M. hyopneumoniae, M. hyorhinis and uncultured Mycoplasma spp. The results indicated that real-time PCR-HRM assay is a rapid and cost-effective screening method that we can rely on to discriminate between different Mycoplasma species.",
