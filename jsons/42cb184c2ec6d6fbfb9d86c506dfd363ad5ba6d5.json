The two terms are not synonymous, however, as some patients presenting with acute unexplained respiratory failure will be found to have a more specific disease. The benchmark for DAD is the hyaline membrane. Some authors have used the term acute interstitial pneumonitis for cases where the etiology of the DAD is unknown, and restricted the term DAD to cases where the etiology is known. The disease, when usually sampled, is subacute (weeks), principally alveolar rather than interstitial (alveoli filled by myxoid fibrosis), and not a pneumonitis (principally fibrosis rather than inflammation).",

Among the many forms of methotrexate-induced drug reaction is DAD, although these cases are rare. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia also could represent an element of hypersensitivity or be idiopathic.

Having said that, there are two possibilities: (1) acute eosinophilic pneumonia; (2) CEP/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) overlap syndrome. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia of the sort that can cause adult respiratory distress syndrome can be an unpredictable disease, and its cause is generally unknown. One can see hyaline membranes and alveolar fibrosis of the sort seen in diffuse alveolar damage, and I suspect that is the situation here. The other possibility is CEP/BOOP overlap syndrome. The pathology is consistent with that interpretation, but against it is the activity of the fibrosis and the atypia of the proliferating epithelial cells, as you indicate.

This can best be described as DAD but is unusual, in that the process is focal (one lobule involved and an adjacent lobule uninvolved), more neutrophils than usual for DAD, and arterial clots with neutrophils away from the DAD. I do not believe the DAD is infectious but cannot exclude that possibility. The arterial clots are probably thromboses due to the DAD. I cannot exclude thromboembolic disease, including septic thromboemboli as a trigger for the DAD. The blood vessels have rare subendothelial mononuclear cells, which could represent either blasts or activated lymphocytes. Overall, the pathology is not that of a leukemic infiltration of the lung. DAD is relatively common at autopsy in patients dying with leukemia, and its etiology in these patients is unclear. Multifocal neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia might cause obstructive or restrictive lung disease in another patient, but in this patient this disease is not of significance at this time. There is extensive organizing fibrinous pleuritis and mesothelial hyperplasia suggesting a chronic effusion. Lobules of alveolar fibrin and the pleuritis could represent ischemia and early infarction, additional evidence raising the possibility of thromboembolism.",

The above constellation of findings is best explained as a late organizing phase of DAD (also known as acute interstitial pneumonitis). Hyaline membranes, which are the usual marker for DAD, are not apparent, but they disappear in DAD that has continued for more than a few weeks. A small amount of fibrin in alveoli is consistent with DAD. The principal differential diagnosis is UIP in an accelerated phase.

The character of the organizing fibrosis in the interstitium, which is approximately 4 wk old, is most easily explained as a late resolving phase of DAD at a stage which is not usually sampled. Some authors would term this acute interstitial pneumonitis. The disease is older than the reported clinical symptomatology of 5 d of respiratory distress. Squamous metaplasia is extensive, and bronchioles contain neutrophils and histiocytes. These changes suggest a bronchiolar component to the condition, and we considered BOOP in the differential diagnosis. However, the diffuseness of the interstitial fibrosis is more in keeping with DAD, although an occasional case of BOOP is associated with diffuse interstitial fibrosis and has been termed bronchiolitis with interstitial pneumonia (BIP). A unifying diagnosis would be a viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia that progressed to DAD, and this is the interpretation I prefer but cannot prove. No active infection is apparent. No viral inclusions are present. No hyaline membranes are present. I do not believe this represents UIP because the disease is for the most part of uniform age, although there are a few areas of older scarring beneath the pleura.

I cannot make a diagnosis of CEP from this specimen, but eosinophils may be scarce in the BOOP/ CEP overlap syndrome and particularly scarce after chronic disease and after treatment with corticosteroids. Therefore, this histology could represent a scarring phase of the BOOP/CEP overlap syndrome. The scarring is more extensive than normally seen with that condition. There has been lung atrophy associated with the scarring and parasitized systemic arteries entering the lung associated with pleural adhesions Several organizing thromboemboli or thrombi are present as well as one organizing bone marrow embolus. The significance of these is uncertain. The degree of inflammation could account for these clots as thrombi, but if they are thromboemboli, an extrapulmonary source might be sought.

The disease is active with edema and fibrin. The absence of hyaline membranes and myxoid fibrosis is against DAD (acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute interstitial pneumonitis), as is the clinical history.

CEP is not infrequently associated with BOOP, and I suspect that this scenario is present here, but we have only the OP and not the BO.

The clinical and pathological features are not typical for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but occasionally a localized OP with eosinophils may be the morphological representation of a hypersensitivity reaction.

Granulomatous inflammation can be seen in BOOP, and the combination of bronchiolitis with eosinophils and granulomatous inflammation in this case raises the possibility of hypersensitivity reaction, which could further be investigated by clinical and serological tests. Usually hypersensitivity reactions have more diffuse granulomatous inflammation and not the relatively discrete granulomas which are present here.

The fibrosis is all of approximately the same age, which is approximately several weeks in duration. The panlobular distribution and uniformity of age suggests an OP, and the most likely etiology would be resolving infection, although no active infection is apparent. Extensive hemosiderin is present, and in the context of fibrosis, a diagnosis of hemosiderosis is appropriate. However, the hemosiderosis might also be a residue of a prior infectious pneumonia including viral pneumonia. There is also bronchiolectasis with mucus plugging, which could represent either traction bronchiectasis or damage due to cigarette smoke. Occasional small nodules of metaplastic bone are present. I do not believe these have clinical significance.",

The fibrosis is several weeks in age histologically, and fibrosis is even older as it has undergone incorporation into the interstitium. The differential diagnosis is principally between COP and UIP. Because of the relative uniformity of the process temporally and spatially, I favor COP. Most persons, including me, consider COP of this sort as a variant of BPOP but without the bronchiolocentricity, which is not apparent here. The British have used the term cryptogenic organizing pneumonia to mean COP of this sort. I cannot absolutely exclude UIP, but the preponderance of alveolar disease here favors COP. UIP occasionally has an accelerated phase with prominent alveolar disease, but I do not favor this interpretation, even though the clinical story is consistent with UIP. Some of the alveoli contain cholesterol clefts. These presumably represent bronchiolar obstruction with distal accumulation of histiocytes disintegrating into lipid material.",

Thus, the morphology is best classified as a pneumonia. The edema and neutrophils indicate ongoing activity. If this were ongoing DAD, I would expect hyaline membranes. The lack of temporal and spatial heterogeneity means that this would be a very unusual picture for UIP, although the reported clinical and radiographic features might suggest that interpretation. I am left with the descriptive diagnosis of subacute and chronic organizing pneumonia with small component of bronchiolar disease. This could be a residue of infection, hypersensitivity reaction, or other causes. I think of the disease in this case as similar in its etiological possibilities to BOOP.

One slide has subpleural honeycomb fibrosis, and so another possibility is UIP, which can be associated with a DIP-like reaction but generally not with such a massive histiocytic infiltrate. Neither DIP nor UIP correlate well with the reported clinical features in this patient. The irregular character of the scarring makes me favor a diagnosis of a generic OP such as might be seen in a resolving infection including unusual organisms such as virus, mycoplasma or Legionella.
