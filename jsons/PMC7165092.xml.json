Although the fellowship continues to be governed by the existing common and specific program requirements, the ACGME has also added some qualifiers, including the provision of adequate resources and training, adequate supervision, the maintenance of professionalism standards, and the preservation of existing work hour limits (full details available at www.acgme.org/covid-19, last accessed April 2nd 2020). Board-eligible fellows may apply for and receive emergency credentialing from their respective health system so that they may function as attendings in anesthesiology to further aid in managing the increased clinical workload. However, the amount of time they spend outside of the clinical area of their fellowship may not exceed 20% of the fellowship year. While surveys, self-study, and site visits will be suspended in stage 2, fellowship programs should do their best to continue with educational activities, while accommodating for adequate social distancing and other local rules and policies regarding the size meetings or gatherings. Thankfully there are a variety of technology-based solutions that allow for the continuation of educational activities under such restrictions, including remote video- and audio-conferencing technology, internet-based resources, and similar innovative tools.",

In this crisis mode, the fellowship is governed by the following four overriding requirements: respect for work hour limits; the provision of adequate resources and training; maintenance of adequate supervision; and the potential for fellows to function as attendings in their core specialty of anesthesiology. The other requirements for Stages 1 and 2, as well as for the fellowship subspecialty, are waived during Stage 3.",

The interpretation and implementation of the information and policies from the ACGME, institutional graduate medical office, and the department leadership can be led and facilitated at the fellowship level by the program director.13\n,\n15\n,\n19 A regular series of townhall-style meetings will allow the fellows to be heard and express their concerns and ideas for addressing the impact of the coronavirus crisis, including the clinical, educational and emotional considerations.2, 3, 4\n,\n24 Of note, fellows should be re-assured that the clinical minimums set by the ACGME are a means to evaluate programs themselves, not individual fellows. Thus, the decision as to whether an individual fellow will graduate from a training program is up to the program director and larger clinical competency committee irrespective of whether all minimum case numbers have been met.10\n,\n13\n,\n15 The ACGME has also stated that the COVID-19 crisis and its effects on fellowship case logs will be taken into account when program reviews eventually restart (full details available at www.acgme.org/covid-19, last accessed April 3rd 2020).",
