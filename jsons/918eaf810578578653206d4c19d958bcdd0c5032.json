Under the R&D Blueprint Plan of Action, the World Health Organization (WHO) has convened a group of experts to agree on standard procedures to rapidly evaluate experimental vaccines during PHEs while maintaining the highest scientific and ethical standards. The Blueprint priority diseases, selected for their likelihood to cause PHEs and the lack of adequate medical countermeasures, were used to frame our methodological discussions. Here, we outline major vaccine study designs to be used in PHEs and summarize high-level recommendations for their use in this setting. We recognize that the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the Blueprint priority diseases may be highly uncertain and that the unique characteristics of the vaccines and outbreak settings may affect our study design. To 2 address these challenges, our group underscores the need for novel, flexible, and responsive trial designs. We conclude that assignment to study groups using randomization is a key principle underlying rigorous study design and should be utilized except in exceptional circumstances. Advance planning for vaccine trial designs is critical for rapid and effective response to a PHE and to advance knowledge to address and mitigate future PHEs.",

Furthermore, outbreaks may typically last only a few weeks and it may take one to two weeks for an outbreak to be detected and confirmed.

The conduct of research needs to be fully integrated into the international effort to control the disease, and should not be performed at the expense of the broader response to a PHE.

In addition, if there are poor or limited diagnostics or limited infrastructure, endpoints requiring laboratory confirmation may be hard to detect.

Groups of experts argued that randomized trials are the most reliable and rapid way to identify the relative benefits and risks of investigational products and that every effort should be made to implement designs with random group assignment during outbreaks and epidemics (12, 14) . Our group concurs with the above statement. Randomized trials are the study design of choice in PHEs, and deviation from the use of randomized designs should occur only under very exceptional circumstances under a robust risk-benefit analysis. For instance, if there is sufficient evidence of the safety and effectiveness of an investigational vaccine and there is no satisfactory alternative, the use of randomization may raise ethical concerns and acceptability among the affected populations.",

Sites could be natural groupings of people at high risk of infection, or sites could be defined responsively following local disease spread. The primary analysis of an iRCT estimates the individual-level reduction in susceptibility to disease or infection (\"direct vaccine effect\" or sometimes \"vaccine efficacy\"). Population-level effects of vaccination, including indirect (spillover) protection, are typically not estimable (15) . In some settings, high levels of indirect vaccine protection could dramatically reduce or shut off transmission in the comparator arm within small units (16) .

This approach works best when the vaccines have complementary mechanisms of action and similar target populations.

From a public health perspective, this approach is attractive because it provides a method to evaluate concurrently a possibly large number of vaccine candidates evoked by the appearance of a PHE, has the potential to diversify the number and supply of vaccines available, and helps avoid monopoly situations in the long-run.

However, if the vaccine is ineffective or dangerous, more people are exposed to the vaccine than would be in a trial with placebo or unrelated vaccine control. This approach is expected to have lower power and the outcome estimates may be biased (31) . To reduce bias, the length of the delay should be relatively long compared to the disease incubation period and the time required for the immune response to develop among vaccinated people.",

The per protocol analysis restricts the population to eligible, fully compliant participants receiving all doses as allocated per protocol. The analysis includes a delay, usually starting after the final dose of the vaccine plus the maximum incubation period, to allow the immune response to develop and to account for the time between infection and symptom onset. The goal of the per protocol analysis is to estimate the intrinsic efficacy of the vaccine to support licensure decisions and planning, but it is subject to post-randomization biases such as differential loss to follow-up. Alternatively, an ITT analysis includes all cases occurring after randomization or all cases occurring after the first dose of vaccine/placebo. The ITT analysis yields a practical, though more context-specific, estimate of vaccine effectiveness because it includes cases who may have been infected before the vaccine induced an immune response, as well as individuals who fail to comply with the protocol, potentially for reasons relating to the vaccine itself. As a result, the ITT estimate of VE tends to be attenuated compared to the per protocol estimate, and the difference between the ITT and per protocol estimates of VE may be especially large if many infections occur during the per protocol delay (31) . In the modified ITT approach, a sensitive test is used to retrospectively exclude individuals infected at baseline (33) , though this requires the availability of both baseline samples and a reliable test. Although ITT is the preferred approach in clinical trials, VE trials typically conduct a per protocol primary analysis (34) . Though only a single primary analysis may be selected, both ITT and per protocol estimates of VE should be reported.",

A key principle is that randomized designs should be utilized whenever possible. Observational studies (e.g., cohort studies, case-control and test-negative designs (15, 35, 36) ) are non-randomized and therefore should only be considered in certain limited settings because the quality of inference will always be viewed as inferior relative to a randomized design. A setting where observational studies may be useful is when the product of interest has received conditional licensure but needs to be further evaluated. Like any observational study, collection of and adjustment for potential confounders is critical. Results of observational studies are easiest to interpret when the effect of the intervention is large enough so as to overshadow random error and bias, especially due to confounding (37) . Furthermore, human challenge studies, where participants are intentionally exposed to the pathogen, can use classical experimental designs and relatively small sample sizes to directly assess efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of an experimental vaccine. In rare settings, human challenge studies may be used to support regulatory decisions, provided that that the human challenge model system is adequately predictive of efficacy in the field (38) .",

The design of the vaccine trial should include specification of data monitoring boundaries allowing for early termination of the trial for benefit or for futility while controlling the trial's type 1 error rate and preserving power. Group sequential guidelines, such as an O'Brien-Fleming or Pocock boundary, provide a widely implemented approach (40, 41) . The number and timing of interim analyses can be flexibly defined through an alpha spending method (42) . The flexibility of interim analyses is important because it may allow a trial to be stopped at the earliest opportunity in order to discard a futile or unsafe vaccine or to further endorse an experimental vaccine to influence the course of the current outbreak. In this regard, the ability of a trial design to be transformed into an intervention that can influence the course of the outbreak is also essential. Following the promising results of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine against Ebola virus disease (29), the targeted and flexible nature of the ring vaccination approach used in Guinea allowed for the rapid transformation of rings into an intervention in response to a flare-up of Ebola transmission, several months after West Africa was declared Ebola-free, and where the vaccine was deployed under compassionate use criteria (43) . If a trial is terminated early, there should also be a plan in the protocol for next steps, which may include vaccinating all eligible, consenting, unvaccinated participants. These participants should then be followed for safety outcomes since the product would be unlicensed at that time.",

For example, transmission among humans may decline to extremely low levels or stop entirely, precluding accrual of further evidence to directly evaluate vaccine efficacy. The protocol should clarify how study data would be analyzed in this scenario, including alpha spending, as the fully needed sample size would not have been reached. A waning epidemic could trigger study closure with a final analysis, study pause until the next outbreak occurs in that area, or study continuation to collect additional safety and immunogenicity data. Keeping the study open would also be desirable in case there is an unexpected surge in transmission. This decision could be guided by an evaluation including transmission modelling to assess the probability of future cases in the current outbreak or future outbreaks in the study area. This type of modelling has been used to inform likely case accrual for Ebola vaccine trials (44) . It may be difficult to accumulate enough evidence to reliably ascertain the efficacy of an intervention from a single outbreak. As a result, it may be necessary to proactively plan to combine information across multiple outbreaks (or trials within the same outbreak) to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention. The methods for combining evidence from randomized trials across outbreaks are covered in reference (45) .",
