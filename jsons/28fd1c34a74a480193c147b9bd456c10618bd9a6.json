            "text": "It was observed that in the case of Turkey, a negative Spearman correlation for the number of infected class and a positive Spearman correlation for both the number of deaths and recoveries were obtained. This implied that the daily infections could decrease, while the daily deaths and number of recovered people could increase under current conditions. In the case of South Africa, a negative Spearman correlation for both daily deaths and daily infected people was obtained, indicating that these numbers may decrease if the current conditions are maintained. The utilization of a statistical technique predicted the daily number of infected, recovered and dead people for each country; and three results were obtained for Turkey, namely an upper boundary, a prediction from current situation and lower boundary. The prediction shows that Turkey may register in the near future approximately more than 6000 new infections in a day as worst case scenario; and less than 300 cases in the perfect scenario. However, the country could register in the near future a daily number of 27000 people recovered from COVID-19 in the perfect scenario; and less than 5000 people in a worst scenario. Moreover, Turkey in a worst-case scenario could record a high number of approximately 200 deaths per day; and less than 150 deaths in a perfect scenario. Similarly, in the case of South Africa, the prediction results show that in the near future the country could register about 500 new infected cases daily and more than 25 deaths in the worst scenario; while in a perfect scenario less than 50 new infected and zero death cases could be recorded. The histograms of the daily number of newly infected, recovered and death showed a sign of lognormal and normal distribution, which is presented using the Bell curving method parameters estimation. A new mathematical model COVID-19 comprised of nine classes was suggested; of which a formula of the reproductive number, well-poseness of the solutions and the stability analysis were presented in details. The suggested model was further extended to the scope of nonlocal operators for each case; whereby the Atangana-Seda numerical method was used to provide numerical solutions, and simulations were performed for di\u00a4erent non-integer numbers. Additionally, sections devoted to control optimal and others dedicated to compare cases between Turkey and South Africa with the aim to comprehend why there are less numbers of deaths and infected people in South Africa than Turkey were presented in details.",

            "text": "1 Introduction known for other countries now has become true and real in South Africa. How did we get here? The outbreak of COVID-19 started in China, Wuhan City, around December 2019; but within a short period the spread crossed over to some countries in Europe like United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and France. The \u2026rst con\u2026rmed patient was a 38-year old male who visited Italy and arrived back in South Africa on March 1, 2020. The patient, after noticing symptoms of fever, malaise, a sore throat, cough and headache consulted a private general practitioner on March 3. From the 5 March to 15 March 2020 the number of infected people increased signi\u2026cantly, as a result on 15 March 2020, a national state of disaster was declared by the President of South Africa to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This announcement was followed by measures including immediate travel restrictions and closure of schools from 18 March 2020. On 23 March, the South African government announced a country lockdown with e\u00a4ect on 26 March 2020. By the end of April, South Africa o\u00a2 cially had 5647 con\u2026rmed cases. To date, South Africa is o\u00a2 cially con\u2026rmed an African country with more con\u2026rmed cases, with 3471 active con\u2026rmed cases, 2073 recovered and 103 deaths due to COVID-19. In the case of Turkey, the \u2026rst case of COVID-19 was con\u2026rmed and recorded on the 11 March 2020. Four days later, Turkey registered its \u2026rst death caused by COVID-19. COVID-19 spread like wild\u2026re in Turkey; in which by the 21 st of April the country had con\u2026rmed approximately 95591 cases of infected people, with 14918 number of recovered people and 2259 deaths recorded. The rapid spreading of COVID-19, has raised the total number of con\u2026rmed cases to 120200, of which 48900 have recovered and 3200 have died by the end of April 2020. In comparison to other European countries such as Iran, it is recorded that the total number of con\u2026rmed cases in Turkey surpassed it exceedingly; resulting in Turkey to be categorized as the most a\u00a4ected country in terms of numbers of con\u2026rmed cases within the settlement of the Middle East. Furthermore, Turkey's total number of con\u2026rmed cases by the 20 April was also recorded to exceed that of China; even though there were some raised concerns that the total con\u2026rmed cases in China could have been underestimated. The consideration of these statistics prompted researchers from Turkey and South Africa to undertake research in di\u00a4erent \u2026elds of science, technology and engineering in the last 3 months, since their future is left uncertain. As the virologists are focusing their attention in developing a vaccine that could be used to prevent the spread of the deadly virus; mathematicians rely on modelling techniques to produce multi-scenarios models that could be utilized to foresee the future [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, as mathematicians our role is to use and apply mathematical tools, particularly mathematical models, on suggested scenarios that could be helpful in predicting the future. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of spread in both countries and structured the paper as follows: Section 2 presents a detailed statistical analysis of COVID-19 spread in Turkey. Then we present a detailed statistical analysis of COVID-19 spread in South Africa. Also after using the inverse problem approach and the Bell curving approach we present the parameter's estimation, we present a comparative analysis between Turkey and South Africa. In Section 3, we suggest a new mathematical model of COVID-19 that takes into account nine classes, including, susceptible, infected with 5 sub-classes, recovered class, death and vaccinated. Then presents the positivity of solutions of the model as well as the reproduction number; and also deals with local and global asymptotic stability of disease free equilibrium and endemic points. In Section 4 we present an analysis of the suggested model with non-local operators. In section 5, we present numerical the suggested mathematical model for COVID-19 using Atangana-Seda scheme for fractional and fractal-fractional operators. In section 6, we present the optimal control of the disease. Finally we present a discussion, recommendations and conclusion respectively.",

The analysis presented in this section does not aim at praising nor criticizing any country; but just to assess the e\u00a4ect of lockdown and its regulations, and to perceive if this concept can help save humans before the vaccine. The fundamental question to answer here is to know why South Africa has less number of deaths and infected people than Turkey; if it recorded its \u2026rst con\u2026rmed case six days earlier before Turkey recorded its \u2026rst. The answer may rely on two fundamental facts which include the period lockdown was implemented and the type of lockdown put in place. The South African government publicized on 23 March 2020 a 21-day of national lockdown which started e\u00a4ectively from midnight 27 March. This was announced 22 days after the \u2026rst con\u2026rmed case was recorded in the country. The lockdown came with strict measures encompassing, immediate deployment of South African National Defence force to ensure that all people living within the territory of South Africa obey the lockdown rules. Only workers considered necessary to operative response to the pandemic were exempted, namely: health caregivers, security service providers, essential service providers that are fundamental to the rudimentary functioning of economy as well as other workers in industries that cannot be economically shut down. This implies that the mentioned categories were permitted to go to their places of work during the lockdown. On the other hand, the numbers of people at gatherings apart from funerals were limited to 50 people; while restaurants, taverns, bottle stores and shops that are not selling indispensable goods were forced to close. Thus, a large population was not allowed to leave their houses except for essential needs. Consequently, the movement between provinces, metropolitan and districts were also restricted unless for essential reasons that cannot be catered for within provincial boundaries.

Likewise, all international and domestics passenger \u2021ights were prohibited, except those assigned to evacuate citizens from foreign countries and certain repatriations due to COVID-19. However, the measures taken by Turkey were not implemented swiftly upon the con\u2026rmation of its \u2026rst COVID-19 case. It is recorded that the Turkish government announced a partial lockdown on 11 April 2020, a month after the country registered it \u2026rst con\u2026rmed case of COVID-19. Prior to the announcement of the partial lockdown, mosques cafes, night clubs, and all universities within the country were already closed on 11 March 2020. The restriction measures applied only on people younger than 20 years old and older than 65 years old, who were not allowed to leave their homes except for indispensable reasons. In addition, the government ordered a ban on movements between 30 major cities with metropolitan status as well as Zonguldak; whereby the lockdown is applied every weekend since 11 April 2020 and also 21-23 April 2020. Punishment (money) is applied for people who go out. Very importantly the government have totally banned the sale of masks, but provided free masks to its people to be compulsory utilized in public places. However, the newly placed order exempted health care assistance, funerals, military and passenger transports from the ban; provided that certain conditions are met. Although both countries have put severe measures to protect their citizens from the deadly disease; there are still records of rising number of infected and dead people in both Turkey and South Africa. Does that mean that the lockdown regulations are worthless? Absolutely not! It is only that several citizens in respective countries are not adhering to the rules and regulations put in place by their respective government authorities. This results from the concept of social distancing being largely misunderstood, as it is not clearly de\u2026ned to mean whether persons should stay one meter away from one another or only from any infected humans, contaminated air and other objects because of the nature in which COVID-19 can be spread. Nevertheless, due to a long incubation period of COVID-19, approximately 14 days maximum; which renders ordinary citizens not to di\u00a4erentiate an infected person from others; then it is crucial that stringent measures be implemented, which will prohibit people from leaving their homes; and in case they had gone out, they should maintain the one metre distance away from each other and frequently wash their hands upon touching any object.",

However, it is important to note that the principal aim of these mathematical models is to describe a system using mathematical tools, concepts and language. Hence, throughout the history of human beings, researchers working within the \u2026eld of mathematics have developed more accurate and e\u00a2 cient mathematical models. For instance, history has made reference to one of the well-known Newtonian laws which described very accurately many problems in our daily lives; although they are coupled with some limits. In instances where these laws failed, two other well-known concepts namely; theory of relativity and quantum mechanics using mathematical formulas can be utilized instead. Generally, these concepts are of great importance in all \u2026elds of science such as in natural sciences including chemistry, biology, physics, and earth science, in engineering such as computer science, and electrical engineering, as well as in social science where their applicability to economics, sociology, psychology and political science can be relevant. In other words, mathematical models can help to provide a clear explanation of a system and investigate the e\u00a4ect of several components, and later make an accurate predictions based on the observed facts. In the current situation under study, due to the magnitude of fear imposed by COVID-19 on humans, it is therefore paramount for mathematicians to provide conceptual models, using mathematical tools called di\u00a4erential and integral operators, to suggest well-constructed mathematical models that will be used to understand and predict the spread of COVID-19.",

Very recently, Atangana and Seda [10] made use of Newton polynomial to introduce an alternative numerical scheme that can be used to solving nonlinear equations arising in many \u2026eld of science, technology and engineering, the method has been recognized to be very e\u00a2 cient and accurate. In this section, we will make use of the Atangana-Seda scheme to solve the suggested mathematical model for COVID-19 for di\u00a4erent di\u00a4erential operators.

In this section, we will use 7 control variables as 7 possible control strategies to perform our aim. The control variable u 1 is the partial lockdown of schools, travels, universities, some businesses in Turkey. Also government apply partial lockdown by age of people and sometimes states where spread of virus is high. The control variable u 2 is the vaccination which is applied to susceptible individuals. The control variable u 3 is the information campaign to people that have symptoms but not have been tested. The control variable u 4 is the treatment for the infected individuals. The control variable u 5 is the personal protection which is performed with masks, sanitizer and other stu\u00a4s.The control variable u 6 is the self-quarantine exposed people. The control variable u 7 is the isolation of infected people. We modify our model by adding these control variables such as; S = k 1 pe x N (1 u 1 ) (I + w ( I D + I A + 1 I R )) + 1 + 1 S u 5 S u 2 S + u 7 I R u 6 S I = k 1 pe x N (1 u 1 ) (I + w ( I D + I A + 1 I R )) S (\" + + + 1 ) I I A = I ( + + + 1 ) I A u 3 I A I D = \"I ( + ' + 1 ) I D I R = I D + I A (v + + 1 ) I R u 7 I R u 4 I R + u 6 S (6.1)",

            "text": "The COVID-19 fatality on mankind prompted them to undertake serious investigations covering various aspects within several \u2026elds of science, technology and engineering in the last 4 months. While researchers have obtained some successful results, they are still struggling to get an e\u00a4ective vaccine that could prevent the spread of the deadly COVID-19 among human beings. From December 2019 to 30 April 2020, there are 3441767 con\u2026rmed infected cases, 1097858 recovered and 243922 deaths worldwide. Among which, 6336 con\u2026rmed cases, 2549 recovered and 123 deaths are recorded in South Africa; and 124 375 con\u2026rmed cases, 58259 recovered and 3336 deaths in Turkey. South Africa registered its \u2026rst con\u2026rmed case of COVID-19 before Turkey on 5 March 2020; while Turkey witnessed its \u2026rst case on 11 March. The unfolding of the spread of COVID-19 in both countries has defeated the general expectations that South Africa would record more infections and deaths comparing to Turkey. As a result, endless scienti\u2026c questions were asked within di\u00a4erent \u2026elds of science; which impelled the compilation of this paper to present critical and comprehensive studies with cases studied in South Africa and Turkey in particular. Although both countries have put in place severe measures to protect their citizens; the statistical predictions from the suggested mathematical models and predictions from statistical analysis show two di\u00a4erent patterns for both countries. For instance, in Turkey, a high and exponential growth in new infected numbers from 11 March to 11 April 2020 was observed due to late implementation of the lockdown regulations; however, from 12 April to 02 May 2020 this country has observed an exponential decay in the daily numbers of new infected cases. Thus, Turkey curve seems to follow a lognormal distribution, which of course could mean that they are winning the COVID-19 war; or they took control of the situation. As a result, it is possible that Turkey in the next few months could end the spread of COVID-19, if they maintain the energy and adhere to the measures in place to combat this virus. However, if they relax, the prediction from reliability level method indicated that Turkey could see a very rapid exponential growth in numbers of daily deaths and new infections. Furthermore, it is observed that the exponential decay in the daily number of new infected and death cases corresponds to the period of lockdown implementation and the stringent rules put in place by the Turkish government; by which the contravening of the rule is punishable with a monetary \u2026ne. On the other hand in South Africa, although the numbers are not as high as those of Turkey, three phases are observed from statistical results. The \u2026rst phase goes from 5 March 2020 to 27 March 2020, where the country witnessed an exponential growth in numbers of new infected and deaths daily; and it corresponds to a pre-lockdown period. The second phase began on 28 March until 18 April 2020, in which the country observed a slowly increase of new infected and death daily; a period corresponding to lockdown period enforced with the presence of South Africa Defence Force. While the last phase ranges from 19 April to 02 May 2020, in which the country observed an exponential growth in numbers of new infected and deaths per day. This exponential growth is attributed to the relaxation and disobedience of lockdown regulations; probably due to economic breakdown, increasing poverty e\u00a4ects among the larger population and also due to migration from level \u2026ve to level four on the 1 st of May 2020. Therefore, as the provision of a suitable vaccine to save and protect human beings the wrath and the fatality of 83 .

Additionally, the wearing of masks should be adopted in public places to avoid the spreading of the virus, in case the social distancing rules is not being kept. It is further paramount that the medical workers in charge of COVID-19 patients are well protected to minimize the contraction of the virus from the patients and passing it on to the general public. In addition to the prohibition of alcohol sales and usage in public places; public smoking should also be prohibited in the e\u00a4ort to combat the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the statistical analysis results speci\u2026cally the reliability level prediction and the results obtained from suggested mathematical models; indicated that without social distancing restrictions or clear implementation of lockdown regulations, it will be impossible for countries to control the spread of COVID-19. This implies that the number of new infected and deaths per day would be di\u00a2 cult to contain, resulting in the \u2026ght against the virus to get out of hand. These outcomes from reliability level are therefore indicated in blue lines in Figures 18, 19 , 20, 29 and 30 those from reliability level. The suggested mathematical models with di\u00a4erent di\u00a4erential operators including classical and nonlocal operators in the last 12 Figures as case with lockdown and no-lockdown presented for di\u00a4erent fractional orders also con\u2026rmed the results obtained from the reliability level. In consideration of all prediction results, it is concluded that South Africa has not yet won the war against COVID-19 and serious outbreak are expected in the near future as the climate season changes to winter. Cold seasons are scienti\u2026cally proven to be thriving climate for the survival of corona virus. Therefore to avoid this foreseen crisis, social distancing must be a responsibility of each person living within the Republic of South Africa, and the transition from level 5 to level 1 should be implemented very wisely.",
