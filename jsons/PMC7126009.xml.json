This is, perhaps necessarily, an imprecise definition which does not specify the level of past or \u2018threatened\u2019 incidence increase and does not differentiate true increases in incidence from apparent increases due to greater awareness. Additionally, it does not take into account geographical variation whereby an EID agent may be emerging in one region but established in another [23], and the period of 2 decades is somewhat arbitrary. Therefore, in the absence of a precise and universally applicable definition, \u201cemerging\u201d could be applied to infectious diseases on a regional basis taking into account local epidemiology.",

Therefore EID outbreaks are typically difficult to predict and risk assessments often have a high degree of uncertainty. While the major transfusion-relevant viruses are transmitted human-to-human without vectors or host reservoirs and have an endemic worldwide distribution, a number of EID agents known to be transfusion-transmissible, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Plasmodium spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi, are primarily vector-borne and have a defined geographical distribution [19]. Due to the focus on the major transfusion-relevant viruses in the 1980s and 1990s, sensitive and specific assays for universal donor screening have been developed and implemented in most countries, and TT risks can be estimated by risk models [45], [46], [47], [48], [49]. In contrast, donor screening is not possible for most EID agents as suitable assays have only been developed and approved for a limited number of agents, including WNV [23], [50], [51], T. cruzi\n[52], hepatitis A virus (HAV), human parvovirus B19 (primate erythroparvovirus 1) [53], [54], [55], DENV [56], [57] and Plasmodium spp. [58]. Moreover, even when a suitable assay is available for an EID agent, universal donor screening is not always implemented as it may not be mandated or considered a proportionate response to the perceived level of risk, or not feasible due to inadequate resources.",

However, modeling based on incident-window period methodology is not applicable to EID agents for which donor screening has not been implemented as the incidence of infection in the donor population is not known and an assay window period is not applicable.

For example, based on an estimated weekly donor prevalence of 1.07 CHIKV cases per 100 000 (95% CI, 0.38-2.03) donors at the outbreak peak, the actual risk of severe infection in recipients was estimated as 0.0001 per 100 000 donations.

Firstly, the diagnosis and reporting of symptomatic infections in the general population represents all symptomatic cases. Secondly, published historic data estimating the ratio of asymptomatic/symptomatic infections is applicable to the study population. This ratio is important as it allows the total incidence (symptomatic and asymptomatic) in the general population to be estimated from the incidence of reported symptomatic infections. Thirdly, individuals with symptomatic infections would either not present to donate or would be excluded from donating. In the BP model this assumption is the basis for determining the period for which an infected donor is at-risk of presenting to donate \u2013 the entire viraemic period for donors who remain asymptomatic and the pre-symptomatic period for those who do develop symptoms. Fourthly, blood donors have the same risk of infection as the general population and therefore the incidence of infection in the blood donor population is the same as that in the general population.",

Direct comparison of TT risk estimates from the BP model and EUFRAT have been reported for three EID outbreaks, either by different investigators in separate studies or by the same investigators as part of a single study. Using the same data set and input parameters, both models have been applied to the 2007 CHIKV outbreak in Italy [85], [89] and the Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands in 2007\u20132009 [93] with very similar risk estimates for each outbreak. A third study comparing the EUFRAT and the BP model was performed for RRV in Australia, also using the same data set and input parameters for both models [88]. Unlike the 2 previous examples, the RRV modeling showed what appeared to be a substantial difference between the risk estimates of the EUFRAT and BP models. For example, the EUFRAT estimate for risk of (asymptomatic) infection in donors (ie, the risk of collecting a viraemic donation) in the state of Western Australia for the 12-month period June 2013 to May 2014 was 1 in 33, 481 (95% CI, 11 415-109 695) compared to the BP model estimate of the risk of collecting a viraemic donation of 1 in 58 657 (uncertainty range, 17 320-232 208). This difference in the risk estimate may be due to methodological differences between the models noted above. The BP modeling was performed using most plausible (with lower and upper) point estimates for viraemic periods and asymptomatic/symptomatic infection ratio while the EUFRAT model estimates were based on assumed distributions for these parameters. Additionally, unlike the BP model, EUFRAT does not take into account the pre-symptomatic viraemic period for the proportion of infections that develop clinical symptoms. However, it should be noted that the most plausible estimate of the BP model was within the 95% CI for the EUFRAT estimate indicating the risk estimates were not significantly different.",

Until the ZIKV outbreak on Yap Island in 2007, no major outbreaks had been reported [43], [100]. However, a number of ZIKV outbreaks since 2007 have dramatically demonstrated the outbreak potential of the virus. The first reported outbreak occurred on Yap Island in 2007 with an estimated 5000 cases [43], [101], [102], [103], followed by an outbreak in French Polynesia in May 2013 with an estimated 30 000 cases by May 2014 and subsequent spread to the Western Pacific region during 2014\u201315 [43], [99], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113]. In early 2015 a ZIKV outbreak was reported in the Americas which remains ongoing and has become the largest ever reported outbreak. As at 14 November 2016, there were 46 countries (excluding the US mainland) in the Americas that had reported active ZIKV transmission [106]. By 2 March, 2017 a total of 548 690 suspected and 205 013 confirmed ZIKV cases had been reported by the Pan American Health Organization in the Americas [114] and 221 cases of locally acquired ZIKV had been reported on the US mainland [115]. In these recent outbreaks outside of Africa, transmission is believed to be primarily a human-mosquito-human cycle with A. aegypti as the primary mosquito vector [116]. However, non-vector-borne modes of transmission have been reported: sexual [117], [118], [119], [120], [121], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126], [127], [128], [129], [130], [131], [132], [133] including male to male [134] and female to male [135], perinatal and intrauterine [136], [137], [138], [139], [140], [141], [142], [143], [144], breast feeding [136], [144], [145] and blood transfusion [43], [146], [147], [148], [149].",

Firstly, as noted above, ZIKV has demonstrated an ability to establish infection in humans and spread within human populations. Secondly, an estimated 80% of ZIKV infections do not develop symptoms and symptomatic infection includes a pre-symptomatic viraemic period [102], [105], [156], [157], [158], [159], [160], although the viraemic period appears to be typically brief with relatively low levels of virus [102], [105], [161], [162]. In addition, ZIKV RNA has been detected in asymptomatic blood donors during outbreaks in French Polynesian (2013\u201314) [105], [163], Puerto Rico (April 3\u2013June 11, 2016) [164], Martinique (January to June 2016) [165] and the continental US (May to October, 2016) [166]. Thirdly, there is a general consensus that ZIKV is the causative agent of severe neurological disorders [43], [167], [168], [169], [170], [171] including microcephaly in newborns [95], [96], [172], [173], [174], [175] and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) in the wider population [109], [176], [177], [178], [179]. Fourthly, there is evidence that ZIKV is transfusion-transmissible as at least four probable TT cases have now been reported, all from Brazil during the current outbreak. [148], [149], [155], [180], [181] Therefore, there is now sufficient evidence that ZIKV is a transfusion-transmissible EID agent, similar to the phylogenetically related DENV [56], [182], [183], [184], [185], [186], [187], [188], [189], [190] and WNV [72], [73], [74], [75], [77], [191], [192].",

In Fig. 2\nwe have summarized the basis for this parameter uncertainty. Nonetheless, in response to the growing evidence that ZIKV represents a threat to blood safety, a number of jurisdictions have implemented risk mitigation strategies as a precautionary or pre-emptive approach, even though this risk has not been estimated by formal modeling. For example, following the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of the use of two investigational blood donor screening assays for ZIKV nucleic acid testing (NAT) under an investigational new drug application (IND) [193], [194], it subsequently issued a guidance for industry recommending the implementation of either universal screening of all donations in the US for ZIKV by individual donation (ID)-NAT or pathogen reduction technology for platelets and plasma [195]. It has been noted that this guidance was issued without a formal risk assessment and without stakeholder consultation [152].",

So that health authorities are able to anticipate and respond quickly to EID outbreaks and potential threats to blood safety, intense ongoing surveillance, epidemiological modeling and risk assessments are essential. Modeling the TT risk of EID agents can be an important part of risk assessments, informing decisions regarding when risk mitigation strategies should be implemented and which strategies are the most appropriate. In this review we have described the methodological principles of two published models for estimating the TT risk of EID agents. An understanding of the methodology that underpins these models will assist investigators in applying them to specific EID outbreaks and interpreting the uncertainty associated with risk estimates.",
