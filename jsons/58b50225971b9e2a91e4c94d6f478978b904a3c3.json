            "text": "We are in the midst of a global viral pandemic, one with no cure and a high mortality rate. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene complex plays a critical role in host immunity. We predicted HLA class I alleles from the transcriptome sequencing data prepared from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of five patients at the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. We identified the HLA-I allele A*24:02 in four out of five patients, which is higher than the expected frequency (17.2%) in the South Han Chinese population. The difference is statistically significant with a pvalue less than 10 \u22124 . Our analysis results may help provide future insights on disease susceptibility.

The resulting coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has a relatively high (\u223c3.4%) mortality rate [1] -a figure that varies widely between jurisdictions due to factors yet to be determined. Currently, no vaccines or effective treatments are available. Most current data analysis efforts are, understandably, focused on the virus itself for the purpose of vaccine development and tracking its evolution for diagnostics and infection monitoring purposes.",

Thus, gaining insights on host susceptibility to the coronavirus is clearly another important aspect that needs to be worked on and understood. One would expect a link between host immunity genes and susceptibility or resistance to infection. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene complex includes two classes of such genes, which encode the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). Proteins of the MHC present (class I) internally-or (class II) externally-derived antigenic determinants (epitopes) to T cells, which upon recognition of the epitope-complex, will mount an immune response to defend against viral and bacterial infections. HLA genes are therefore cornerstone to acquired immunity in humans. HLA alleles have also been shown to be factors in susceptibility or resistance to certain diseases, and their frequency and composition in human populations vary widely (http://allelefrequencies.net). A previous study found HLA class I genes HLA-B*46:01 and HLA-B*54:01 to be associated with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infections in Taiwan [4] -a related disease to the current pandemic.",
