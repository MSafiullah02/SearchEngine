Many factors and routines in surgery are evidencebased, but most of them are still lacking evidence and can probably never be investigated because of ethical problems. Consequently, consensus and guidance are used to a great extent. Surgery opens into sterile tissues for hours, where there is massive tissue damage by knife, diathermy, clogging of vessels, pressure against and drying of tissues, decreased blood supply, impaired phagocytosis and impaired infection defence. Microbes deposited in this devitalized tissues may find a good basis for growth and proliferation if there is lack of infection control and sterility. For patients with ongoing infections and who need surgery, special routines are made to prevent the spread of infections in the operation department. This chapter is a practical description of many important preventive procedures that may protect the surgical patient against surgical site infection (SSI).",

At vaginal births, the contamination was undetected by half of the personnel and by caesarean undetected by 90% [64] . \u2022 Endo et al. [65] examined 600 surgical face masks with visors or face shield and found that 66% were blood contaminated: at eye level 37%, in eyebrow elevation 38% and face masks 60%. Surgeon 1 had contaminated masks with visors in 84% of cases, the surgeon 2 69% and surgical nurse 46% [65] .

Pathogenic bacteria were found in and around a heavily polluted sink, on the hands of staff after handwashing, on contaminated \"clean hands\" and in the air near the sink. The sink was closely located to the patient beds where the air around the nearest bed had the same microbes as in the air around running water in the sink (aerosols). After actions, including closing off the sink, the infection rate was reduced to 5.6% [87] . Singlebed rooms in ICUs may reduce the number of infections, and length of stay becomes shorter [89] .",
