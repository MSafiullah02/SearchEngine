Now, the task is bearing the burden of identifying, isolating, triaging and managing the rising number of cases, necessitating total engagement of the medical community, public health sector, governments and society as a whole. For the medical and public health communities, this enormous task requires approaches that are both rapidly scalable and sustainable.

They draw on and highlight lessons from the 2003 SARS experience in Toronto. Notably, while they utilized airborne, contact, and droplet precautions in a negative pressure room, no advanced personal protective equipment (PPE) such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) was used. The rationale was simple. Prior research demonstrates that using unfamiliar or increasingly complex PPE increases the risk of selfcontamination 3 . Consequently, training for healthcare workers (HCW) focused on ensuring proper donning and doffing techniques with familiar, well-rehearsed PPE procedures. As Sun Tzu noted, \"If in training soldiers' commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined.\" 1 The authors also highlight improvements in infection prevention and control (IPC) infrastructure, administrative controls, and public health coordination compared to their 2003 SARS experience. Standard staffing models rather than a dedicated COVID-19 team were used safely. Strategies that focus on maintaining the workforce by requiring sufficient training for all staff offer potential for more sustainable, scalable HCW capacity in these extraordinary settings. Still, these authors note the paucity of evidence-based guidance for initial triage and discharge timing decisions in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",

As illustrated by the Canadian report, the allure and novelty of PPE \"maximalism\" should be avoided in favor of proven strategies that HCW have practiced and conduct with a high-degree of fidelity without self-contamination. Regarding triage, Bryson-Cahn 4 and colleagues in Washington state present a novel framework for home screening and evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) based on prior preparation for Ebola community screening in 2014. Their experience describes nine community-based assessment visits during which teams screened PUIs in a variety of community settings after the IPC team determined a home assessment was appropriate. Detailed protocols are given for how a HCW team, with appropriate training and required supplies, can safely perform a focused assessment and collection of screening samples outside the healthcare setting.",

At this stage where screening must expand from narrow geographic-based criteria to syndromic surveillance, rapid and validated testing at scale must be available to help inform clinicians and public health officials for isolation, triage and care of patients. Fortunately, FDA Emergency Use Authorization regulatory requirements have been relaxed to allow more laboratory developed tests to come online even as the CDC races to expand testing capacity in the public health sector. These efforts must be given utmost priority to define the scope of current community transmission and to allow proactive, rather than reactionary, public health responses.",

The World Health Organization and others have issued helpful guidance on the rational use of PPE for COVID-19, aimed at optimizing HCW safety while mitigating disruptions in the global PPE supply chain. 5 Rapid scalability in the supply of pharmaceuticals and PPE must be considered a public health imperative. Moreover, preventing rushes on the public market through measured risk communication with the public can help safeguard needed supplies. Finally, we must consider strategies to decrease less urgent use of PPE and identify situations where we can use different types of protection, where elements of PPE can be reused, or where the use of PPE is not supported by evidence-based practice.",

Marchand-Senecal et. al. point out that specialized, dedicated teams in an outbreak, while attractive, could be quickly overwhelmed as cases increase. Moreover, longer shifts and increased work intensity may lead to HCW fatigue and lapses in PPE techniques, driving nosocomial transmission, a painful reminder from the battle with SARS. Initial reports indicate about 4% of Chinese HCW caring for COVID-19 patients were infected, with 15% classified as severe or critical disease. 6 Transmission to HCWs, a feature seen with SARS and MERS, is devastating as it simultaneously diverts resources, depletes HCW capacity, saps morale, and drives public fear. To mitigate this, healthcare systems experiencing a surge in cases should consider all measures to liberate resources and staff, including telemedicine triage, drive-thru testing, and preparations to reschedule elective medical care.",
