If the N gene assay was more sensitive than the ORF 1b assay, one would expect that the \u0394Ct of a sample would be much greater than the \u0394Ctcalibrator. We first tested this hypothesis using RNA isolated from infected cells. Indeed, even when virus-infected cells were harvested at the late phase of viral replication (60 h postinfection), the \u0394Ct from infected cells was statistically greater than the \u0394Ctcalibrator (Table 3 ; P <0.02). By contrast, the \u0394Ct values for NPA samples were not statistically different from the \u0394Ctcalibrator (P = 0.89). In addition, we also determined the \u0394Ct value for stool samples. Again, the \u0394Ct of stool samples was not statistically different from the \u0394Ctcalibrator (Table 3 ; P = 0.64).

At days 1\u20133 after disease onset, approximately one-fourth of NPA and stool samples from SARS patients were positive in the conventional RT-PCR assay. The detection rates for these samples increased as the disease progressed. Because SARS is a respiratory disease, the low detection rate of SARS CoV in stool samples early after disease onset was not surprising. It is, however, striking that the detection rate of SARS CoV in NPA samples isolated during the first 3 days after disease onset was surprisingly low (26%). A possible explanation may be that the replicating site of SARS CoV in the early stage of the disease is restricted to the lower respiratory tract (15)(16).

In this study, we focused primarily on improving the detection of SARS CoV cDNA. This could be achieved by use of radioactively labeled probes to detect PCR amplicons. However, these approaches often require further downstream processing and are less practical in a routine clinical setting. Therefore, we established a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay to target the ORF 1b region of SARS CoV. Our results demonstrated that early in the course of the disease, the real-time assay for the ORF 1b gene was more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay (Table 1 ). However, the detection rates of the conventional and real-time assays became very similar as the disease progressed. This observation could be explained by the fact that there was more viral RNA in specimens collected at later time points (Fig. 2 ). Thus, for most of the samples collected at the second week after disease onset, the amount of viral RNA might well be above the detection limits of both assays.",
