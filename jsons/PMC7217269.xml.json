LDH is a reliable biomarker of acute inflammatory injury associated with upper respiratory infections (URI). Unlike LDH, these cytokines in themselves do not directly represent cellular injury \u2013 the acute-phase cytokines are the mediators of inflammation, whereas LDH is the product of inflammatory injury.[2] LDH is enzyme released in the bronchoalveolar space on damage of cytoplasmic cell membrane. Elevated LDH is also indicator of underlying lung injury and inflammation.[3]",

Cases with normal nasopharynegal LDH can be kept in home isolation and recheck nasopharyngeal LDH if their symptoms persist. Hence, nasopharyngeal LDH can be measured, those with high LDH can be segregated and treated at the earliest, they are likely to have severe course of disease, they may likely be COVID-19 positive as well. While others may be having seasonal flu, without much damage, they may be very well treated at home, of course in home isolation.
