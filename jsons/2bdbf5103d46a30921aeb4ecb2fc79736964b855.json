A calibration process is executed through the solution of an inverse problem with the help of a Trust-Region-Reflective algorithm, used to determine the best parameter values that would fit the model response. The purpose of this study is to give a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time. Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the beginning of June with the peak size of \u223c 15, 774 symptomatic infectious cases in Russia, \u223c 26, 449 cases in Brazil, \u223c 9, 504 cases in India and \u223c 2, 209 cases in Bangladesh. Based on our analysis, the estimated value of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) as of May 11, 2020 was found to be \u223c 4.234 in Russia, \u223c 5.347 in Brazil, \u223c 5.218 in India, \u223c 4.649 in the United Kingdom and \u223c 3.5 in Bangladesh. Moreover, with an aim to quantify the uncertainty of our model parameters, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) which is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is applied which elucidates that, for Russia, the recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers, the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the transition rate from quarantined class to susceptible class are the most influential parameters, whereas the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are highly sensitive parameters in Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom which could significantly affect the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. Our analysis also suggests that relaxing social distancing restrictions too quickly could exacerbate the epidemic outbreak in the above mentioned countries.",

The PRCC index is found to 446 be \u22120.585. In addition, rate of entering into home-quarantine or self-quarantine of 447 susceptible individuals (q) and the fraction of wrongly quarantined people who be-448 come susceptible after certain latent period (r 1 ) are the other two influential empirical 449 features with PRCC indexes are \u22120.5672 and 0.567 respectively. 450 In case of Brazil, rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of suscep-451 tible individuals (q), the fraction of quarantined people who become susceptible due 452 to avoiding home-quarantine (r 1 ), and the inverse of the COVID-19 mean latent pe-453 riod are the most influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size 454 (I D (t)). The corresponding PRCC indices are \u22120.62, 0.53 and \u22120.499. The figure 12b 455 qualitatively elucidates that a high quarantine rate of the susceptible individuals can 456 curtail the number of symptomatic infected individuals. In broader view, high efficacy 457 of home or self-quarantine and a lower unlockdown rate could flatten the I D (t) curve 458 in Brazil. 459 In case of the India, rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of sus-460 ceptible individuals (q) and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are the 461 most influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size (I D (t)) and 462 the corresponding PRCC indexes are \u22120.64 and \u22120.62. Both the parameters are neg-463 atively sensitive to the size of detected infected individuals which is illustrated in the 464 figure 12c.
