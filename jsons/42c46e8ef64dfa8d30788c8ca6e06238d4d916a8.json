At present, the efforts of various countries focus on the rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients, as well as to find a treatment that can combat the most serious impact of the disease. The number of reported COVID-19 virus infections is still increasing. Unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of human coronaviruses, but there is an urgent need for in-depth research on emerging human infectious coronaviruses. Clarification transmission routes and pathogenic mechanisms, and identification of potential drug treatment targets will promote the development of effective prevention and treatment measures. In the absence of confirmed effective treatments, due to public health emergencies, it is essential to study the possible effects of existing approved antivirals drugs or Chinese herbal medicines for SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, virus structure and targeting strategies of COVID-19. Meanwhile, this review also focus on the re-purposing of clinically approved drugs and Chinese herbal medicines that may be used to treat COVID-19 and provide new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on novel COVID-19.",

CQ/HCQ block viral from entering into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors, proteolytic processing, and endosomal acidification, as well as regulate immunity through attenuation of cytokine production, inhibition of autophagy and lysosomal activity in host cells [35, 36] . CQ can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection at a low-micro molar concentration and HCQ is more potent than CQ [37, 38] . A multicenter clinical trial involving more than a dozen hospitals in China showed that CQ can improve radiologic findings, enhance viral clearance and reduce disease progression in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so China has included CQ in the recommendations regarding the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [37, 39, 40] . At the same time, another clinical trial showed that HCQ can significantly shorten the clinical recovery time and promote the absorption of pneumonia among patients with COVID-19 [41] . Notably, azithromycin reinforced the effect of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 patients, but the publishing journal's society subsequently declared that the trial did \"not meet the Society's expected Standard\" [42, 43] . Conversely, the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir [44, 45] . In summary, although CQ/HCQ have shown anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy both in vivo and in vitro trials as well as relatively well tolerated, some clinical trial designs and outcome data have not been submitted or published to peer review [46] . It is not recommended in the use of CQ/HCQ for COVID-19 outside of the hospital or a clinical trial due to lack of reliable efficacy data and potential toxic effects [47, 48] .",

Subsequently, research about it also showed significant anti-SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV activity [51, 52] . As a nucleoside analog with exonuclease resistance, remdesivir is metabolized to active nucleoside triphosphates that effectively prevents the elongation of the RNA chain by inhibiting RNA polymerase, but will not be digested with a viral exonuclease (nsp14) with proofreading activity [53] .

However, the results of the global clinical trial are believed that remdesivir can relieve symptoms and reduce mortality, especially for patients in intensive care who require mechanical ventilation [56] . Meanwhile, the clinical trials in Chicago have suggested that early COVID-19 patients benefit more due to the reduction of lung damage [57] .

As a new protease inhibitor, LPV/r interrupts viral nucleic acid replication via inhibition of 3CLpro [63] . Xushun Guo's team at Sun Yat-sen University School of Medicine derived a homology modeling to confirm that LPV/r significantly inhibited the function of CEP_C30 to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction cycle [64] . In addition, two groups in China and Korea have reported LPV/r can improve the clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 [65, 66] . Besides, LPV/r can achieve better antiviral effects when used with interferon or ninavir than alone [67] . However, the latest evidence suggests that it may cause liver damage and prolong hospital stay in the COVID-19 infected patients [68] . Furthermore, no benefit was observed with LPV/r treatment beyond standard care in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 [69] . Therefore, whether LPV/r can become an important adjuvant drug in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy and improve the clinical outcome of patients remains to be determined. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Antiviral therapy with Chinese herbal medicines have been recorded for a long time in Chinese history, and previous studies have shown that Chinese herbal medicines have great potential for preventing SARS transmission [105] . Given the low toxicity and availability of Chinese herbal medicines, screening active compounds targeting viral or host targets from Chinese herbal medicines may be a potential strategy for treating COVID-19. In this review, we summarized potential Chinese herbal medicines ( Table 2 ) that may treat COVID-19 by targeting proteins such as Spike protein, ACE2, 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp. We also predicted the binding affinities between these compounds and COVID-19 related targets by molecular docking, with a focus on six compounds: quercetin, andrographolide, glycyrrhizic acid, baicalin, patchouli alcohol, and luteolin. And the binding patterns of these six compounds to the key targets of SARS-CoV-2 are shown in Figure 2 . ",

It has been confirmed that quercetin showed a good inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV 3CLpro expressed in Pichia pastoris, with an inhibition rate of 82% [111] . In addition, enzyme inhibition assays in vitro also showed that quercetin had inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro [112] . Since the 3CLpro sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV [10, 25] , we speculated that quercetin may also exhibit antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2. However, it has not been documented whether quercetin inhibits SARS-CoV-2, so we docked quercetin to 3CLpro as well as other key targets, and the docking results showed that quercetin bound well to each target, with a binding energy of -5.6 kcal/mol to 3CLpro.",

In addition, andrographolide exerts antiviral activity against H1N1 by inhibiting the activation of RLRs signaling pathways and thereby improving H1N1 virus-induced cell death [121] . To test the anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2, we docked andrographolide with key targets, and the results also showed that andrographolide bound well to the key targets including Spike protein, ACE2, 3CLpro, RdRp and PLpro, which indicated that andrographolide has potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

In addition, Yunjia Yu et al. found that intracellular PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways may be involved in the anti-IAV effect of PA and PA significantly inhibits the in vitro proliferation of different IAV, suggesting that PA may block IAV infection by directly killing viral particles and interfering with some early stages after viral adsorption [136] . Another study showed that PA also has an effect against influenza virus (IFV) in vivo and enhances protection against IFV infection in mice by enhancing host immune responses and attenuating systemic and pulmonary inflammatory responses [137] . To investigate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of PA, we investigated the possibility of PA binding to SARS-CoV-2 related targets using molecular docking ( Table 2 ). The docking results showed that the binding effect of PA and Rdrp was satisfactory, which provided some support for the antiviral effect of PA. The above study results showed that patchouli alcohol had antiviral effect and also modulated the levels of inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that PA may be a novel and effective antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug for COVID-19.",

From the target point of view, the binding effect of ACE2 and PLpro with these natural compounds was more prominent; while from the natural compounds, the lowest binding energy was -9.0 kcal/mol for Cryptotanshinone and PLpro, while the highest was -4.3 kcal/mol for Lignan and 3CLpro, that is to say, the range of binding energy was from -9.0 kcal/mol to -4.3 kcal/mol, which indicated that the natural compounds had a good binding effect with the target. Our aim of docking was to select natural compounds with high potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, but it should be pointed out that these compounds cannot be considered to treat COVID-19 only by such a screen which is aimed to provide priority to focus.",

A large number of studies have shown that licorice and its chemical components have protective effect on lung inflammation and damage, and it is a promising herbal medicine for treating SARS[124]. Cinatl J et al.compared the effects of conventional antiviral drugs ribavirin, 6-azouridine, pyrazofurin, mycophenolic acid, and glycyrrhizic acid on SARS-CoV, and the experimental results showed that glycyrrhizic acid had a better viral inhibitory effect than the other four drugs in inhibiting the viral adsorption and penetration[125]. Hoever G et al. also showed that glycyrrhizic acid has a good anti-SARS-CoV effect, while SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to different subclasses of coronaviruses with similar structures[126]. In addition, glycyrrhizic acid can promote IFN-\u03b3 production by T cells[127]. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have the same receptor ACE2, and glycyrrhizic acid can bind to this receptor, suggesting that glycyrrhizic acid may have therapeutic effects on SARS-CoV-2[128]. To discuss whether glycyrrhizic acid has an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, we performed molecular docking of glycyrrhizic acid with the binding energy of glycyrrhizic acid and ACE2 -7.0 kcal/mol (As the shown inTable Jo u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2). At the same time, the binding energy of glycyrrhizic acid with other targets: 3CLpro, PLpro,",

Chen et al. have demonstrated the antiviral activity of baicalin against SARS coronavirus, with an EC50 value of 12.5 \u03bcg/ml at 48 hours, and the activity tended to decrease with incubation time beyond 48 hours[132]. Due to the similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, it can be speculated that baicalin may also have an antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2. In addition, Deng et al. used UV spectrophotometry to determine angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity and found that baicalin could inhibit ACE in vitro, with an IC50 value of 2.24 mM[133]. Hansen Chen et al. used molecular docking technology to find that baicalin may have a strong binding effect with ACE2, and the possible binding sites are ASN-149, ARG-273, HIS-505[128]. Haixia Su et al. showed that baicalin, as a non-covalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, has high ligand binding efficiency",

Guided by the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, exerting the advantages of overall regulation of traditional Chinese medicine is an important method for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. At present, Qingfei Paidu Decoction is recommended for the treatment of clinically confirmed cases according to Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Pneumonia (On Trials\uff0cthe Seventh Edition) in China[39]. A study including 98 patients with COVID-19 showed that Qingfei Paidu Decoction has a good clinical effect for the treatment of COVID-19, it can significantly improve the abnormal laboratory test indicators and clinical symptoms of patients, reduce the adverse reactions of patients, and effectively improve the therapeutic effect[154]. In addition, Lianhua Qingwen was also demonstrated to significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells at the mRNA level as well as markedly reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that Lianhua Qingwen may have a potential inhibitory effect on the cytokine storm induced by SARS-COV-2[155]. At present, symptomatic and supportive therapy is still the key to clinical treatment. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicines have both antiviral and symptom-relieving effects may lead to better therapeutic effects.At present, western medicine treatment is mainly based on the principles of symptomatic treatment, prevention of complications, treatment of underlying diseases, and prevention of infection[39], while traditional Chinese medicines play an important role in relieving the symptoms of patients and delaying or reducing the development of mild diseases into severe diseases[156], and may also play a role in reducing the side effects of western medicine, especially in the recovery of pulmonary function[157]. Both Chinese herbal medicine and approved western medicine have their own advantages in the treatment of COVID-19. In the course of COVID-19's treatment, the combination of Chinese herbal medicine and approved western medicine has shown obvious effect, which is of great value in alleviating the early clinical symptoms of patients and reducing the incidence of patients from mild to severe then to intensive care[158]. The combination of nefenavir and sinomenine significantly reduced the amount of virus accumulation and shortened the time of virus clearance compared with single use of nefenavir and sinomenine[159]. In short, the combination of Chinese herbal medicine and approved western J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f medicine is worth thinking about in the future treatment of COVID-19.",

Efforts should also be made to develop specific drugs, promote vaccine research and development, reduce disease morbidity and mortality, and better protect the lives of the people.At present, the potential therapeutic agents used in COVID-19 come from previous experience in treating SARS, MERS or other new influenza viruses. As broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have long been approved on the market to treat different viral infections, their metabolic characteristics, dosage, potential efficacy and side effects are clear. Re-purposing of clinically approved drugs may be an important short-term strategy for the treatment of novel coronavirus. But the disadvantage is that these treatments are too \"broad-spectrum\" to specifically treat COVID-19. In addition, its side effects can not be underestimated. A number of clinical trials are under way to evaluate the effectiveness of other treatment options. Active symptomatic support is still the key to treatment. Although stem cells, monoclonal antibodies, polypeptides, interferon or plasma from recovered patients have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19 patients, their safeties are still being evaluated and the efficacy remains to be further confirmed.Except the some undergoing small molecules, this paper also focuses on the most promising compounds in traditional Chinese medicine in recent years, which can be used as effective antiviral drugs for the treatment of diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 based on in vitro and in vivo studies. In addition, computer molecular docking shows that these monomers have good binding J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ability to COVID-19 virus and host targets. The low toxicity and availability of active compounds of traditional Chinese medicine should be used as potential drug candidates for COVID-19",
