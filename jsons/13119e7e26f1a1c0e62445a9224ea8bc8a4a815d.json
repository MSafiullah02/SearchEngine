Staffing problems have been exacerbated by healthcare workers (HCWs) refusing to work out of concern for their families. I sketch a deontological framework for assessing when it is morally permissible for HCWs to abstain from work to protect their families from infection and when it is a dereliction of duty to patients. I argue that it is morally permissible for HCWs to abstain from work when their duty to treat is outweighed by the combined risks and burdens of that work. For HCWs who live with their families, the obligation to protect one's family from infection contributes significantly to those burdens. There are, however, a range of complicating factors including the strength of duty to treat which varies according to the HCW's role, the vulnerability of family members to the disease, the willingness of family members to risk infection and the resources available to the HCW to protect their family. In many cases, HCWs in 'frontline' roles with a weak duty to treat and families at home will be morally permitted to abstain from work given the risks posed by COVID-19; therefore, society should provide additional incentives to maintain sufficient staff in these roles.",

Furthermore, the staff that are available become fatigued and make more mistakes, some of which increase the transmission of infectious disease.

Social care workers at an aged-care home in Australia refused to work after a COVID-19 outbreak at their facility, citing concern for their family members, some of whom were immunocompromised. 5 Australian disability service organisations have reported 'enormous trouble with workers not turning up'. 6 Physicians and nurses in the UK have threatened to quit because a lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) is putting them and their families at too much risk. 7 8 Most shockingly, elderly patients in Spain appear to have been abandoned in their aged-care facility with some being found dead in their beds. 9 These cases raise the following questions. When is it morally permissible for HCWs to abstain from work to protect their families from infectious disease and when is it a dereliction of duty to their patients? When can society pressure HCWs to meet a moral obligation to work during an epidemic and when would such pressure be unjustified? I set out a deontological framework for answering these questions and apply it in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

COVID-19 is a much worse proposition, however, for the elderly and those with comorbid cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension or cancer. 11 The fatality rate is 8% for those aged 70 to 79 years and nearly 15% for those aged 80 years and above. 11 Many HCWs will have family members in these vulnerable groups. As a rough indication of the risk to family members, consider a 'frontline' nurse who shares a home with his 80-year-old father. There could be as much as a 3% chance of passing on a fatal infection (ie, a 20% chance of the HCW being infected at work and a 15% chance infection is fatal in the father's age group). This risk to family can be decreased if the HCW takes careful measures not to pass on the infection in the home but, given that people are infectious prior to exhibiting symptoms, only highly burdensome measures will be effective. A 'frontline' nurse in Ireland details some of the effort involved: I'll come home from work through my laundry room door that leads to the outside. I'll strip naked including shoes and put everything straight into the washing machine on sanitise mode. I'll use a Clorox wipe to clean anything I touched in the process. I'll then take the towel that my husband has left for me and use it to walk to my master bedroom covered up. In there, a room that nobody else is allowed to enter after today\u2026 after my shower I'll sanitise everything I touched again, then hand sanitise and get dressed. When I'm done with this process I'll be able to sit in the family room 6 feet away from everyone I love. 12 These measures are likely to be required for weeks if not months and, even then, they might not prevent the HCW infecting their family. Furthermore, many HCWs living arrangements won't allow for such effective segregation and they will be unable to reduce the risk to family as effectively. So, why would HCWs be obliged to take on any of these risks and burdens?",

For risk to be implicitly consented to, it must be inherent to the role. A physician specialised in the treatment of infectious disease, for example, could reasonably be thought to have implicitly consented to more risk of infection but not something unrelated like risk of assault. This means that each HCW's duty to treat involves different risks and burdens depending on the characteristics of their role. However, since all HCW's roles inherently involve the delivery of good care, there is an obligation to deliver that care in a range of adverse circumstances, including circumstances that involve some risk of infection and some burden to protect one's family from infection. Those HCW roles that inherently involve treating infectious disease oblige workers in those roles to take some further risk of infection and to bear a greater burden to protect their families from infection than HCWs not in such roles.",

In exchange for these benefits, workers have a duty to treat despite higher risks. The reciprocity argument entails that the strength of the duty to treat is proportional to those benefits. Specialised physicians receive substantial benefits so have a very strong duty to treat. Towards the other end of the scale, social care workers receive substantially less from society than physicians and nurses, so their duty to treat is much weaker. Ideally, the role expectations that HCWs implicitly consent to would be justified in light of the benefits society provides and we can see that this is roughly true-society expects more of physicians than nurses, and much more of both physicians and nurses than social care workers. iii This analysis of the duty to treat allows us to make relational claims such as: HCWs are obliged to take on more risk and burden to care for patients than minimally decent Samaritans are expected to take to help strangers; physicians are obliged to take on more risk and burden to care for patients than social care workers; specialists in treating infectious diseases are obliged to take more risk of infection than non-specialists. But it is difficult iii Of course, society's expectations and the benefits it provides to HCWs can come apart and then the strength of the duty to treat becomes less clear; is it determined by what was implicitly consented to, the benefits society provides or some fusion of the two? Due to space constraints I won't pursue this issue here.",

The measures that one is obliged to take depend on one's relationship with the other and the risk one will infect them. HCWs have a fiduciary relationship with their patients which entails an obligation to work harder to prevent negligent harm to their patients than to strangers. However, HCW's obligation to prevent negligent harm to people they are in close relationships with, such as immediate family, is even stronger. iv18 This is because the deep mutual trust and love that characterise these relationships entail proportionally strong obligations, including an obligation to avoid negligently harming each other. The obligations involved in close relationships can also be asymmetrical, such as when people voluntarily enter into caring relationships with their children or elderly parents.",

In a pandemic, they might do so to reduce the burden on HCWs in their family. To the extent family members waive their claim to not being harmed by infection, the question of whether the HCW is obliged to work depends solely on the personal costs to the HCW. In what follows I assume family members cannot or have not waived this claim.",

            "text": "Outside of epidemics, HCWs typically manage to fulfil both their duty to treat and their duty to protect their family members iv This category of close relationships includes relationships with non-family members but for simplicity I limit my discussion to the HCW's family. It is notoriously difficult to justify the claim that familial relationships per se generate extra obligations because they are not entered into voluntarily. from infection. The conditions created by an epidemic, however, make this unusually challenging and, in some circumstances, the burden of protecting one's family overrides the duty to treat. To illustrate, let's assume that the measures taken by the Irish nurse above-separating a room in the home for her exclusive use and keeping six feet away from her family at all times-are required for any 'frontline' HCW to meet their obligation to close family at home. Does the strength of the HCW's duty to treat oblige her to take on that burden along with the other personal risks and burdens detailed above? My intuition is that it does for those with a strong duty to treat, such as physicians and nurses. Although I expect that some won't share this intuition and this case might fall into the large grey area created by uncertainty over the exact strength of the duty to treat. I think it is less controversial, however, to claim that HCWs with a weak duty to treat are not obliged to take on such a burden to protect their families. Social care workers, for example, can plausibly argue that, since society doesn't provide them with much in the way of benefits, they are not obliged to take such burdensome measures. If that is correct, then the absentee Australian social care workers were morally permitted to abstain from work after the outbreak of COVID-19 in their workplace. 5 This is even more clearly the case for those two workers who reported having to protect immunocompromised family members and so would have to take on an even greater burden to protect them. This line of argument does not, however, justify abandoning people in agedcare homes, as appears to have happened in Spain. 9 Even in cases where social care workers are morally permitted to abstain from work to protect family, they are still obliged to inform management so that alternative measures can be taken.",

One solution to this problem is for society to temporarily employ HCWs in roles with a stronger duty to treat. The risks involved in these roles would be more explicit and so more clearly consented to, and the roles would come with clear benefits such as greater pay, prioritised healthcare for HCW's and their families or accommodation and board for HCWs.",

Consider, for example, a 'frontline' HCW with a strong duty to treat but no available means of sufficiently reducing the risk of infecting his family (perhaps he lives in a small house with a large family and no alternative living arrangements are available). In cases where the family members are not particularly vulnerable and so are unlikely to be severely harmed, the duty to treat trumps the duty to family and the HCW is morally obliged to work. Conversely, for a HCW in the same situation but with an extremely vulnerable family member at home, the duty to family trumps the duty to treat and the HCW is permitted to abstain from work. But in both kinds of case, compensation is owed for the duty violated. In the first kind of case, public healthcare has benefitted at the expense of the HCW's family so fairness requires society compensate the family, perhaps with prioritised healthcare. In the second kind of case, the HCW has been relieved of the excessive burden of protecting a vulnerable family member at the expense of public healthcare, so fairness requires the HCW compensate society, perhaps financially or with free labour after the epidemic.",

This is especially the case with COVID-19 which poses significantly more risk to elderly family members than HCWs themselves. In many cases, HCWs in 'frontline' roles with a weak duty to treat and families at home will be morally permitted to abstain from work, so society should provide extra incentives to ensure these workers are fairly compensated and to prevent staff shortages in these areas.",
