            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped positive single\u2010stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae, and is the leading cause of acute and chronic liver disease in humans, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [1, 2, 3]. There exists no vaccine to prevent HCV infection and current therapeutic agents have limited success against HCV [4]. The HCV genome consists of one translational open reading frame encoding a polyprotein precursor, including structural and non\u2010structural proteins, that is cleaved by host and viral proteases (Fig. 1a). The structural proteins consist of the core protein, which forms the viral nucleocapsid, and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, both of them transmembrane proteins. The HCV cell entry is achieved by the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and the morphogenesis and virion budding has been suggested to take place in the endoplasmic reticulum [5]. HCV proteins are very sensitive to folding, assembly, mutations or deletions. Besides, the HCV genome is widely heterogeneous; the errors during its replication cause a high rate of mutations. Therefore, the region implicated in fusion and/or budding must interact with the membranes and should be a conservative sequence. Finding protein\u2010membrane and protein\u2013protein interaction inhibitors could be a good strategy against HCV infection as they might prove to be potential therapeutic agents.",

            "text": "The HCV core protein is highly basic and shows homology with the nucleocapsid protein of other flaviviruses. This protein is well conserved among the different HCV strains [6] and is important for HCV infection diagnosis by the detection of either specific anti\u2010HCV core protein antibodies or circulatory viral antigens. The core protein has regulatory roles on cell functions like immune presentation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism and transcription [7, 8, 9]. Additionally, this protein has oncogenic potential playing an important role in the regulation of HCV\u2010infected cell growth, transformation to a tumorigenic phenotype and development of hepatocellular carcinoma [10]. Recombinant cDNA expression studies of this protein have identified two major protein core species, p23 and p21 [8]. The later is the predominant species and is found in viral particles from infected sera, probably being the mature form of the protein. Although the three dimensional structure of this protein is unknown three distinct domains can be considered in the full\u2010length immature protein [11, 12], i.e. domain 1, comprising amino acids 1\u2013117 and having several positive charges involved in RNA binding and including the immunodominant antigenic site, domain 2, comprising amino acids 117\u2013171 and putatively responsible of its association with lipid droplets, and domain 3, comprising amino acids 171\u2013191, a signal peptide upstream of the E1 glycoprotein. Significantly, the mature core protein is a dimeric helical protein exhibiting membrane protein features [11].",

These results have permitted us to suggest the possible location of different segments in these proteins which might be implicated in protein\u2013lipid and protein\u2013protein interactions, helping us to understand the processes which give rise to the interaction between the protein and the membrane. Additionally, HCV membrane assembly and budding is an attractive target for anti\u2010HCV therapy, as it has been proposed that the core protein has an important role in viral assembly. To investigate the structural basis of the protein core interaction with the membrane and identify new targets for searching viral assembly inhibitors, we have analysed and identified different membrane\u2010active regions of the HCV core protein by observing the effect of 18\u2010mer core\u2010derived peptide libraries from two HCV strains, namely, HCV 1AH77 and HCV 1B4J, on the integrity of different membrane model systems. Furthermore, we have studied the secondary structure of specific membrane\u2010interacting peptides, both in aqueous solution and in the presence of model membrane systems, to understand the molecular mechanism of viral budding as well as making possible the future development of HCV assembly inhibitors which may lead to new vaccine strategies.",

For assays of vesicle leakage at pH 7.4, buffer containing 10 Tris\u2013HCl, 20 NaCl, 40 CF, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, was used [13]. To obtain MLV, 1 mL of buffer was added to the dry phospholipid mixture and vortexed at room temperature until a clear suspension was obtained. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) with a mean diameter of 90 nm were prepared from MLV by the extrusion method [14] using polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 0.1 \u03bcm (Nuclepore Corp., Cambridge, CA, USA).

The medium in the microtitre plates was continuously stirred to allow the rapid mixing of peptide and vesicles. Leakage was assayed until no more change in fluorescence was obtained. Changes in fluorescence intensity were recorded with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 492 and 517 nm, respectively. Excitation and emission slits were set at 5 nm. One hundred per cent release was achieved by adding Triton X\u2010100 to the microtiter plate to a final concentration of 0.5% (wt/wt). Fluorescence measurements were made initially with probe\u2010loaded liposomes, afterwards by adding peptide solution and finally by adding Triton X\u2010100 to obtain 100% leakage.

The concentration of each of the fluorescent probes within the liposome membrane was 0.6 mol%.

The spectra were obtained in a Bruker IFS55 spectrometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) using a deuterated triglycine sulphate detector. Each spectrum was obtained by collecting 200 interferograms with a nominal resolution of 2 / cm, transformed using triangular apodization and, to average background spectra between sample spectra over the same time, a sample shuttle accessory was used to obtain sample and background spectra. The spectrometer was continuously purged with dry air at a dew point of \u221240 \u00b0C to remove atmospheric water vapour from the bands of interest. All samples were equilibrated at the lowest temperature for 20 min before acquisition. An external bath circulator connected to the infrared spectrometer controlled the sample temperature. For temperature studies, samples were scanned using 20 \u00b0C intervals and a 15\u2010min delay between each consecutive scan. Subtraction of buffer spectra taken at the same temperature as the samples was performed interactively using either GRAMS/32 or Spectra\u2010Calc (Galactic Industries, Salem, MA, USA) as described previously [20, 21]. Frequencies at the centre of gravity, when necessary were measured by taking the top 10 points of each specific band and fitted to a Gaussian band. The criterion used for buffer subtraction in the C=O and amide regions was the removal of the band near 1210 / cm, and a flat baseline between 1800 and 2100 / cm.",

For enveloped viruses, the assembly of the virions takes place in the host cell membrane and in the case of HCV it has been suggested that the virus particles assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes [26] where the core protein might play a central role in viral particle formation as well as it might drive the budding process [27]. Significantly, the HCV core protein is very well conserved among different HCV strains [6] and has important regulatory roles on different cell functions. Interestingly, the HCV core protein has been reported to be associated with raft sub\u2010domains in the absence of other viral non\u2010structural proteins [28]. Rafts, rigid membrane sub\u2010domains located predominantly in the plasma membrane are described to be important in the HCV replication cycle, assembly of virions and budding from the host cell. For this reason, we have chosen membrane model systems composed not only of a liver lipid extract but also of EPC, SM and Chol [29, 30], as mimetic of model membranes containing raft domains. As the biological roles of the HCV core protein can be modulated by membranes, we have identified the membrane\u2010active regions of the HCV core protein by studying the effect of two core\u2010derived peptide libraries from HCV on the integrity of membrane model systems. Furthermore, to obtain information on the structural basis of the interaction of the protein with model membranes, we have studied the secondary structure of specific membrane\u2010interacting peptides both in aqueous solution and in the presence of model membrane systems. In this way, it would be possible to identify important regions which might be implicated in the budding molecular mechanism, and therefore could be used as new targets for searching viral assembly inhibitors as well as making possible the future development of HCV assembly inhibitors which may lead to new vaccine strategies.",

The first region displayed a high interfacial value along its sequence; however, the second one did not show significant hydrophobic and interfacial values. In this context, it is interesting to note that the region comprising residues 85\u2013123 has been described to be important in homotypic interactions which might be a prerequisite for assembly and budding of HCV\u2010like viral particles [27, 31]. Significantly, mutant core proteins without the 80\u2013118 amino acid residues reduced, but did not abolish the association with lipid droplets [32, 33]. Interestingly, the interaction of a region composed of amino acids 72\u201391 with the E1 glycoprotein [34] has been described; this region might be also important for association with the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondrial outer membranes [35]. Notably, region 85\u2013102 coincides with a hydrophobic cluster located in domain 1 of the core protein and region 106\u2013123 partially overlaps with another one located in domain 2 [36]. By infrared spectroscopy, it was possible to observe that the 85\u2013102 region displayed different types of secondary structure, as random structure was the major one in aqueous solution but an increase in \u03b2\u2010sheet in the presence of model membranes was observed. Although these regions present high levels of membrane rupture, hemifusion and fusion in the whole protein context, this region might be implicated in protein homodimerization but not in protein\u2010membrane interactions.",

As observed in Fig. 1b, this region displays high hydrophobicity and interfaciality values along its sequence. By infrared spectroscopy, it was determined that in aqueous solution, the predominant secondary structure was \u03b2\u2010turn but \u03b2\u2010sheet in the presence of model membranes composed of either raft or liver extract lipids. This region has two sequential glycines which might confer a high flexibility to the peptide and might act as a hinge around which the conformation could change. Moreover, this region is part of the HCV major antigenic domain sequence [37], being probably exposed and implicated in protein\u2010membrane interactions. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that uniformly packed virus particles are generated only by segment composed by amino acid residues 1\u201382, whereas region 29\u201346 is the only one in the N\u2010terminal half of the core protein found to interact with lipids [38]. For this reason, this region might be an important one for the HCV assembly. Another interesting core sequences pertain to the 57\u201374 and 155\u2013172 regions, as they displayed low but constant membrane rupture, hemifusion and fusion activities (Fig. 4a). It has been described that the ability of the core protein to associate with lipid droplets is lost when the 153\u2013172 region containing the YATG motif is deleted [27].

The predicted structure of the whole protein using circular dichroism (CD) indicated that the protein has 16% of \u03b2\u2010helix structure, 29%\u03b2\u2010sheet structure and \u03b2\u2010turns and 55% of random coil, whereas the C\u2010terminal truncated protein was largely unordered [9]. As shown in this work, nearly all the peptides we have assayed display a major random coil or turn structure in solution; however, their structure changes in the presence of model membranes.

However, the prevalent idea is that domain 1 might be the RNA\u2010binding region whereas domain 2 of the HCV core protein would be responsible for membrane\u2010binding (domain 3 is a signal peptide) [11, 12]. Gathering related results in the literature, it is clear that a domain 1 vs domain 2 reasoning is not appropriate to unravel the foundations of HCV core\u2010protein interaction with lipids. The region comprising the C\u2010terminus of domain 1 and N\u2010terminus of domain 2 seems to be the most active in membrane interaction, although a role in protein\u2013protein interaction cannot be excluded. There is a sequence in domain 1 of maximal fusion and hemifusion (sequence f in Fig. 4c) that belongs to the major antigenic sequence of HCV. This sequence most probably plays a part in the biological action of HCV in lipid interaction whether during assembly, or fusion, or both. A more exhaustive study of these lipid\u2013peptide interactions might help in the understanding of the HCV budding molecular mechanism as well as making possible the future development of anti\u2010HCV drugs targeted to budding. These membranotropic regions could be envisaged as new possible targets, as inhibition of its interaction with the membrane could potentially lead to new vaccine strategies.",
