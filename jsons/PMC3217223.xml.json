The data presented in Table 1\nindicate that the presence of a substituent in C-3 in the 2-oxaadamantane nucleus is essential for NMDA receptor antagonism. Thus, primary amine 7 and all its N-alkylated and N-dialkylated derivatives (2a,b, 3a,b, 4, and 8) are inactive as it is the case of the methyl derivatives 10a and 11a. Phenyl derivative 10c is only a weak NMDA receptor antagonist while more lipophilic amines 10b and 10d show a similar potency than amantadine. Further enhancement in potency was achieved by alkylation of 10b, the most active derivative being 12, a tertiary amine that is seven times more potent than amantadine, but still ten times less potent than memantine. Contrary to our expectations, all the benzyl derivatives were found to be inactive. This is in striking contrast with NGP1-01 that features a benzyl group essential for NMDA receptor antagonism, and with previous work by our groups that found that benzylated ring-contracted analogues of amantadine showed NMDA receptor antagonism.12\n",

Of these compounds, the tertiary amines 11a,b were found to be the most active. Amine 11b had an IC50\n = 10.92 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcM and an IC90\n = 15.54 \u00b1 1.14 \u03bcM, while the trimethyl derivative 11a had an IC50\n = 3.97 \u00b1 0.75 \u03bcM and an IC90\n = 6.82 \u00b1 0.84 \u03bcM. Amine 11a was the most potent compound tested, being approximately twice as active as rimantadine (IC50\n = 7.04 \u00b1 0.12 \u03bcM; IC90\n = 13.97 \u00b1 1.68 \u03bcM), and at least 30 times more active than amantadine (IC50\n > 130 \u03bcM). Amines 2a,b, 3a,b, 4, 7, and 8, which lack the C3 substitution, had no activity at concentrations up to 5 mg mL\u22121. The primary and secondary amines 10a\u2013d, 13, and 15 also displayed no significant trypanocidal properties, even though they do carry a substitution at this position.",

The presence of a substitution at the C-3 position is essential for NMDA receptor antagonism. Although 11b, 12, and 15 were more potent than amantadine against NMDA-induced calcium increase in cerebellar granule neurons, they were less potent than memantine. In contrast with the model compound NGP1-01, all our benzyl derivatives were devoid of NMDA receptor antagonism activity. None of the tested compounds showed antiviral activity. Two tertiary amines, 11a and 11b, displayed a significant level of trypanocidal activity; 11a was twice as active as rimantadine. The mechanism by which adamantylamine derivatives kill trypanosomes is unknown, but it has been hypothesized by analogy with the known properties of this class of compound that it may involve channel blocking activity.4 The data obtained with the trimethyl amine 11a now provides a basis for exploring if related derivatives have enhanced activity.",

Cells were loaded with 6 \u03bcM Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) for 45 min. Afterwards, the coverslip was mounted on a quartz cuvette containing a Locke-Hepes buffer using a special holder. Measurements were performed using a Perkin\u2013Elmer LS-50B fluorometer equipped with a fast-filter accessory, under mild agitation and at 37 \u00b0C. Analysis from each sample was recorded real-time during 1200 s. After stimulation with NMDA or glutamate (100 \u03bcM, in the presence of 10 \u03bcM glycine), increasing cumulative concentrations of the compound to be tested were added. The percentages of inhibition at every tested concentration were analyzed using a nonlinear regression curve fitting (variable slope) by using the software GraphPad Prism 4.0.",
