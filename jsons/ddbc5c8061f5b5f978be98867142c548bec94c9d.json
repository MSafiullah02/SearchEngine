            "text": "Gerald P. Bodey, MD, Houston, Texas C linicians first became interested in infectious complications in immunocompromised hosts in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Three major medical advances stimulated this interest: successes in renal transplantation, effective chemotherapeutic regimens with curative potential against a few malignant diseases, and the availability of antimicrobial agents with activity against gram-negative bacilli. Bacterial infections were the major cause of mortality in those early years, so much attention centered on management of these infections. 1 Fungal infections were also recognized as a complication in some immunocompromised hosts, such as those with acute leukemia. Most of these infections occurred in leukemia patients who were not responding to chemotherapy, and progress in this area was thwarted by difficulties in diagnosis and limited therapeutic options.",

This was not surprising, since no routine screening procedures were available during the early 1960s, and these patients often received blood cell transfusions. Several papers were published on the frequent identification of the hepatitis-associated antigen in patients with acute leukemia. 5 After empiric antibiotic therapy for fever in neutropenic patients became accepted practice, it became apparent that a bacterial pathogen could not be identified as the cause of many of these fevers. Hence, in the early 1970s, a few physicians considered the possibility that some febrile episodes in these patients might be due to community-acquired viral infections. Several surveys were conducted to detect these viruses, but they were unsuccessful, and the effort was essentially abandoned.",

This is exemplified by the experience in neutropenic patients, in whom response rates with various antibacterial regimens have usually only been in the range of 30-50%. 6, 7 Although response rates for other infections have improved substantially during the past two decades, this has not been true for pneumonias. Routine sputum cultures have identified the causative agent in only about 20% of cases and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage frequently has failed to establish a diagnosis. Open lung biopsy is often a risky procedure, owing to the possibility of hemorrhage secondary to the patient's thrombocytopenia, and frequently shows only nonspecific acute and chronic inflammation. Many clinicians have recognized that the high failure rate has been due in part to the fact that some of these pneumonias were not caused by bacteria. In retrospect, it is somewhat surprising that those of us caring for immunocompromised patients did not give much consideration to community respiratory viruses as a possible cause of some of these infections.",

Community respiratory virus infections also develop in renal transplant recipients, but they are often less serious and may resolve without therapy. Age plays a role in susceptibility to some of these infections. For example, adenovirus infection is reported to be twice as common in children receiving bone marrow transplants as in adults. 11 Some infections, such as those caused by influenza virus and RSV, are seasonal; others, such as those caused by parainfluenza, are not.

Ribavirin has been effective against RSV pneumonia, if given promptly, in uncontrolled studies. However, the optimum method of administration has not been determined. Existing evidence suggests that inhalation therapy is superior to intravenous therapy, but should we be administering the drug by both routes? Is ribavirin plus IV Ig superior to ribavirin alone?
