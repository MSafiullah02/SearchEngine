In 2016 and 2017 it took place in ACL, in conjunction with BioNLP. In 2018 and 2019, it took place as an independent workshop in EMNLP and ECML-PKDD conferences respectively. In 2020, an independent BioASQ CLEF lab will run and the results will be presented in the context of CLEF 2020 conference.\n",

Additionally, measures that use the MeSH hierarchy to provide a more refined estimate of the systems\u2019 performance are used.

For yes/no questions the official evaluation measure is the macro-averaged F-Measure on questions with answers yes and no. For factoid questions, where the participants are allowed to return up to five answers, the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) is used. For List questions, the official measure is the mean F-Measure.
