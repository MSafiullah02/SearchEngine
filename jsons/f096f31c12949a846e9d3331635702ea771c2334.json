The storm triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has forced each of us into an unfamiliar, life-threatening situation, with health systems, even in the most advanced countries, in crisis [1] . In this report, we would like to focus on the avoidable deaths-in other words, the price that we pay when health systems are unprepared to manage this type of emergency. The goal is not to highlight individual responsibilities, which will have to be assessed in any case, at least from an ethical (and, consequently, political) point of view when this emergency is over. The idea is to balance the importance of various evident shortcomings (i.e., the absence of plans for pandemic management, the serious lack of personal protective equipment, and the absence of differentiated routes for non-infected patients who must have access to non-extendable diagnostic and therapeutic areas). Overall, we have verified, with dramatic evidence, that money is not everything (there have been times when the price of a mask was next to invaluable!). Europe has lacked a homogeneous economic and financial strategy at a time when it is necessary to ensure maximum osmosis between various countries and a coherent flow of information that is capable of promptly and effectively inducing radical changes in social behavior, a strategy which was apparently able to contain the contagion in China [2] . Furthermore, one could speculate that the actual societal model, based on the absolute power of the economy and on the induction of ephemeral needs, does not favor the prompt adaptation of habits that are common to the majority of citizens in order to combat this pandemic emergency.",

Never before has it been necessary for scientific authorities to be solely responsible for appraising innovative proposals and guaranteeing the objective assessment of ideas. At the moment, the common desire is clearly to find a miracle drug or a vaccine that is able, in a short time, to cure and, above all, prevent this disease, allowing us to resume our normal lives. There are parallels between this scenario and the old dream of identifying the \"magic bullet\" that is able to hit and kill cancer cells [3] . Recent progress made in the knowledge and treatment of malignancies has made it clear to each clinician and researcher that there are no drugs or miraculous solutions. We have learnt that small and constant steps forward are possible and were accomplished thanks to the ability to build networks, produce scientific research and share knowledge [4] . COVID-19 is an unknown virus that we are chasing in its race for globalization. Political and religious institutions continue to remind us that we are all \"on the same boat\" and that only common economic and health policies can help us overcome this outbreak. Researchers are also called upon to face this global challenge. How can they? By not losing awareness of the health and economic emergencies, we must remember that only preclinical and clinical research can end this typhoon, as it did in the treatment of neoplasms. We must collect not only clinical data, but also biological material, blood and tissue samples whenever possible. International health institutions are calling for the centralization and coordination of global biological and data banks. If it is true that no one can save themselves on their own, it is equally true that no one will identify the solution to this crisis without a critical multidisciplinary approach.",
