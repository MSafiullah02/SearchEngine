Genomic sequences from civet-cat SARS-CoV strains SZ-3 and SZ-16 were used as standards for comparison [19]. Sequence-variation\u2013distance plots were generated by use of an 800-bp window, a 200-bp step, and a Jukes-Cantor correction. Initially, 4 variable regions (SC18, SC22-23, SC27, and SC28), which contain SNVs of different SARS-CoV genotypes [17], were combined for phylogenetic analysis. Because the resultant phylogenetic tree was not satisfactory, we added another 2 variable regions (SC10 and SC20) based on the sequence-variation plot (figure 2)",

The PCR product was gel-purified for DNA sequencing by use of an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). For the laboratory-contamination case, multiple primers [17] were used for complete genome sequencing. Superscript III RT (Invitrogen) was used for production of cDNA, and a RACE kit (Roche) was used to amplify the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of cDNA. Both strands of the PCR product were analyzed, and the resultant sequences were assembled by use of the SeqMan II software package (version 5.0; Lasergene)",

            "text": "Integration of the results of the phylogenetic analyses and the epidemiological information (figure 4) indicated that there were 5 waves of epidemic SARS-CoV infection in Taiwan during 2003. The first wave, during early March, was composed of 1 imported case, 2 cases of transmission between family members (strain TW1), and 1 nosocomial infection (strain TW3); in cluster B1, both SARS-CoV strain TW1 and SARS-CoV strain TW3 were clustered with other SARS-CoV strains linked to Hotel M in Hong Kong [8, 17]. The second wave (strain TW5) consisted of 4 Taiwanese individuals who contracted the disease as they flew from Hong Kong to Beijing [9] and who then carried it back to Taiwan during mid-March. The third wave, which began in late March, consisted of an infection that occurred on a train (patient TW-HP1), a case of transmission between family members (strain TC1), and multiple nosocomial infections (all \u201cTW-HP\u201d patients and patients TW-GD1, TW-GD-3, and TW-GD4). In cluster B2, all the SARS-CoV isolates mentioned above clustered with the SARS-CoV isolates from Amoy Gardens (strains CUHK-AG01, CUHK-AG02, and CUHK-AG03) [27], with a bootstrap value of 71%. The fourth wave, which started during late April and ended in mid-June, contained SARS-CoV isolates not only from hospitals JC, KC, PH, GD (patients TW-GD2 and TW-GD5), and YM but also from sporadic community outbreaks (strains TW10 and TW11), and all of these SARS-CoV isolates belonged to cluster B3, with a bootstrap value of 71%. The fifth wave occurred during early December and began with a laboratory-contamination case, patient SCVJ. It clustered with both HKU-39849, a SARS-CoV strain used in the laboratory [14], and TWC, another strain from Taiwan [12]. Sequence-variation rates for the strain from patient SCVJ versus strain TWC and for the strain from patient SCVJ versus strain HKU-39849 were, respectively, 0.01% (3/29,756) and 0.04% (12/29,756). In addition, a 24-nt deletion occurred at nucleotide position 26132\u201326155, resulting in both a frameshift of open reading frame 4 and a deletion of 8 aa residues within the small-envelope glycoprotein",

Although the bootstrap values for nodes a and b in the NJ and Pars trees generated by the conventional method were higher than those in the NJ and Pars trees generated by the proposed method, the difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, the bootstrap values for node c in the Pars trees generated by the conventional and proposed methods were 56% and 67%, respectively, and the corrresponding bootstrap values in the NJ trees were 63% and 66%. This finding was confirmed by the ML trees: the P value for node c in the tree generated by the conventional method was not statistically significant, and that for node c in the tree generated by the proposed method was <.01. Accordingly, the tree generated by the proposed method was more reliable; also, because the proposed method requires only 7 RT-PCR reactions to perform the analysis, it is less time-consuming and more efficient than the conventional method.

Although both the second and the third waves were in the B2 cluster, the SARS-CoV isolates in the third wave had their own nucleotide-signature pattern (figure 5). Neither the first wave nor the second wave led to serious outbreaks, but the third wave\u2014originating with a resident of Amoy Gardens who visited Taiwan\u2014led to 1 transmission on a train (strain TWC3), 1 case of transmission between family members (strain TC1), and nosocomial infections in at least 2 hospitals (HP and GD) in northern Taiwan. Only 1 nucleotide difference between strains TC1 and TWC3 was noted (figure 5). In addition, strain TWC3 and an Amoy Gardens strain, CUHK-AG01, shared an identical sequence, even though the woman who was the source of the isolate of strain TWC3 never left Taiwan at any time during the epidemic. An epidemiological investigation showed that the visitor from Amoy Gardens and this woman sat in different cars during the train ride. Because this is the first documented case in which there is molecular proof of transmission on a train, it raises the question of why only 1 passenger contracted the infection. Because it has been reported that SARS appears to be most infectious at 6\u201311 days after onset of illness and not during the first day of symptoms [29], we assumed that the visitor from Amoy Gardens was not highly infectious during the train ride, even though he developed symptoms during the same evening that he traveled from Taipei to Taichung",

In addition, there was a 7-nt difference between TWC and TC1 (figure 5). If we assume that strain CUHK-AG01 represents the first-generation SARS-CoV in the transmission link, then both strain TC1 and strain TWC3 were the second-generation, and TWH was the third-generation. According to the SNV-based analysis (figure 5), the number of nucleotide changes in the SARS-CoV genome per number of intermediate hosts was extremely low (<1 nt change/host). Because it has also been shown that no or very limited nucleotide changes occur in SARS-CoV sequences from either cultures or primary clinical specimens [11, 30], we can tentatively conclude that strain TWC is a laboratory contaminant and did not originate from patient TC1",

As shown in figure 6, after combining the epidemiological data with the results of our phylogenetic-tree analysis, we conclude that the fourth wave of epidemic SARS infection progressed in 2 dissemination paths: the first path was from hospital JC to hospital KC in Kaohsiung and then to hospital PH on Penghu Island; the second path was from hospital JC to hospital GD and then to hospital YM.
