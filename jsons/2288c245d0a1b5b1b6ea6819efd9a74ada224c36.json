At the time, residents and faculty believed this mandate would make it difficult for residents to be adequately trained, 3 Similar to the ACGME work hour restrictions in 2003, the COVID-19 outbreak presents a significant challenge to residency training in neurosurgery. As an initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) recommended suspension of all elective surgical procedures 5 . Further, in an attempt to manage both healthcare provider personal protective equipment (PPE) and human-to-human contact, outpatient clinics at many institutions have been substantially reduced, or pivoted to telehealth. These measures have almost immediately eliminated the traditional educational experiences available to neurosurgical residents. This communication aims to outline how one academic department has adapted to meet the highest standards of neurosurgical education possible given the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Although operative training is the main focus of most Patient Care sub-competencies, with specific procedures detailed by subspecialty, many of the other educational objectives can be met despite the limitations dictated by the COVID-19 crisis. With limited operative time available for trainees, it is exceedingly important for residency programs to optimize all available learning opportunities. At our institution, we have leveraged telehealth to focus on clinical experiences that are traditionally underrepresented in residency training, using educational theory as the underpinning for our activities.",

Mastery models are readily apparent in surgical training, in which skills acquisition and technical proficiency are primary goals. For instance, Ericsson's theory outlines that deliberate practice is a key factor in achieving expertise, with the specific intention and motivation to improve, as opposed to rote repetition. However, it is often underappreciated that this approach is most effective when coupled with constructivist strategies, including experiential learning methods that include targeted feedback from instructors. Experiential learning theory involves learning through direct encounter, reflecting on experiences to develop concepts, and receiving feedback, so that behaviors can be modified for application to new situations. Vygotsky's theory identifies a \"zone of proximal development\"",

The skills learned during inpatient care are not directly transferable to this setting, because of the fragmented way in which care is delivered by residents coming on and off service, and the hierarchical nature of decision-making in the hospital. Clinic experience in residency is highly variable from program to program, and depends on attending availability and program logistics, including work hours, as most residents are primarily responsible for managing the inpatient service.",

            "text": "In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, our department has pivoted quickly to develop a robust clinical pathway for outpatient evaluation using telehealth 17 . The telehealth format is optimal for seamlessly incorporating residents into clinic. With operative volume limited to emergencies at each of our clinical sites, residents have been reassigned to virtual clinics across a number of disciplines, from peripheral nerve and spine to brain tumor and vascular neurosurgery. Prior to COVID-19, the curriculum only allowed space for two required outpatient clinic rotations for all residents, both in spine. Under the current telehealth system, residents are assigned a clinic day for one faculty member at a time. After patients are screened by medical assistants and all of the relevant clinical data is collected by the outpatient coordinator, the resident is able to review the information and conduct telehealth appointments with each patient. Residents are asked to complete documentation in the electronic medical record using a standardized template that automatically incorporates the relevant clinical information and allows the learner to focus on recording their history, virtual physical examination, clinical assessment, and plan. Each case is then discussed one by one with the attending using these templates for efficient review of all clinical data, including imaging findings. The resident can then observe how the attending conducts each encounter with the patient by video conference. Senior residents have the option to take a more central role in the second encounter, depending on the resident's skill level and relationship with the patient. The format of gradually elevated responsibility used in our telehealth clinic is modeled after the ACGME milestones. Residents are provided with the opportunity to go from novice level observation to expert level autonomy, in line with the training guidelines ( Figure 1A ).",

They then can receive direct feedback from faculty members and reflect on their performance, after either observing the attending conduct the same encounter, and or having the attending observe their performance in a follow-up encounter (Vygotsky's theory, experiential learning model). Further, telehealth can easily be adapted to all four of Kolb's learning styles, affording observation for divergent learners, active problem-solving for convergent learners, logical clinical reasoning for assimilating learners, and relationship building--with both patients and faculty mentors--for accommodating learners. Because telehealth is likely going to remain an integral part of care even after the COVID-19 crisis subsides, this format is flexible for adaptation as surgical volume grows, and can even serve as the blueprint for a resident-run clinic (with attending oversight), which is typically difficult to arrange within most health systems.",

Prior to COVID-19, at our weekly case conference with all residents and faculty present, patients from each clinical site are presented and residents have the opportunity to simulate an oral boards examination, practicing surgical decision-making with each case scenario. Using videoconferencing, residents now conduct their own case-based conferences three times per week, with an introductory didactic to review a specific topic followed by case presentations, each moderated by a senior resident and a faculty member with relevant subspecialty expertise. So far, this approach has created a community of practice for social learning (Lave and Wenger's theory) that is primarily resident-driven, not only strengthening relationships between co-residents, but also allowing residents to develop their individual teaching styles while reviewing essential neurosurgical content together. In a manner similar to the telehealth learning structure, the alternative resident learning opportunities provide a means for gradual increasing responsibility, modeling the ACGME milestones ( Figure 1B ). Of note, the alternative education structure is designed with the capacity to expand as the pandemic deepens and regress as elective practices return to normalcy. Ultimately, this makes it possible for our department to maintain the standard of residency education while flexibly adapting to the ebb and flow of the current pandemic.",
