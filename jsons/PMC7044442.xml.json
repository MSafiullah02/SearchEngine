The trial revealed that apneic oxygenation with HFNC during endotracheal intubation increased the incidence of severe hypoxemia after adjustment for PaO2 in patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxemia. Similarly, Simon et al.45 uncovered that the oxygen level during bronchoscopy was significantly lower in patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxemia receiving oxygen via HFNC than those receiving oxygen via noninvasive ventilation. In our subgroup analysis, we found a reduction in the incidence of severe hypoxemia in patients with mild hypoxemia among those receiving HFNC (number needed to treat = 16.7). Furthermore, in the linear meta-regression interaction analysis, we observed that the trend of reduction in hypoxemia incidence followed the reduction in baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratio in patients receiving HFNC therapy. Therefore, we propose that optimal oxygen delivery strategy should be based on the patient; by the same token, HFNC might be beneficial for apneic oxygenation in patients with mild hypoxemia.",

Second, the clinical heterogeneity of the included individuals was a critical confounding factor that should be considered. Third, the effect of HFNC as apneic oxygenation might not be isolated due to the different interventions of pre-oxygenation. Last, there was a paucity of large clinical trial to evaluate the true association between PaO2/FiO2 ratio and severe hypoxemia.
