In J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f contrast, the specificity of CLIA IgM (100%) was greater than that observed for ELISA IgA (86%). Both tests showed similar specificities of IgG at 99% for CLIA and 100% for ELISA. As shown in table 2, during the first week after the onset of symptoms, the ELISA IgA analysis was significantly more sensitive than the CLIA IgM (p < 0.001). Although not-statistically significant, higher sensitivity was also observed for the ELISA IgG Results for the lateral flow assays were easily interpretable with unambiguous coloured reading IgG lines. The colour intensity in the line regions correlated with the concentration of SARS-Cov-2 antibodies. In some cases, IgM line presented slight difficulty for reading in all commercial lateral flow tests. As predicted by the manufacturer, the results were obtained after ten minutes or less in all cases. All the tests performed in this study provided valid results. Overall sensitivity was similar (around 70%) without any significant differences between the three tests (Table 1) . However, the sensitivity for IgM was significant lower (p < 0.001) with LabOn Time as compared to the QuickZen and Avioq assays. The Avioq lateral flow test showed three false positive results of concomitant IgM and IgG reactivity in three samples from a previous epidemic period without any known confounding factor. In contrast, no false positive results were observed among the pool of 31 sera containing antibodies with potential cross reactivity. Globally, no significant differences were observed between the specificity values of the three tests with a positive predictive value of 100% for QuickZen and LabOn Time and 97.7% for the Avioq assays. As shown in Table 2 , similarly to the serological quantitative assays (ELISA and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f CLIA ), the sensitivity of the three lateral flow assays increased during the second week after the onset of symptoms and achieved similar values (91% to 94%) after 14 days. Table 3 shows the percentage of agreement between the five immunoassays. Overall, the best agreement was observed between the CLIA and LabOn Time assays (91%; Cohen Kappa index of 0.819) and between the two lateral flow assays LabOn Time and Avioq (91.5 %; Cohen Kappa index of 0.829). The absence of agreement between the five serological assays observed during the first week following symptom onset lessened 14 days after symptom onset, with all assays achieving 97% to 100% agreement.",

In this study, the ELISA IgG/IgA was tested on a fully automated microtiter plate analyser. The workflow for ELISA tests depends on the analyser used: in our laboratory, the capacity was 90 tests per 3-4 hours. In contrast, the CLIA IgG/IgM assays are fully automated random-access tests. This technology allows up to 180 tests per hour, depending on the platform used, with the results delivered in about 40 minutes. The performance of Maglumi IgG/IgM tests has been successfully evaluated by Padoan et al., showing the reliability of these immunoassays for assessing the immunological response in the sera of COVID-19 patients. These tests show that it takes at least 12 days to reach 100% sensitivity for IgG and a 88% positive rate for IgM [12] . In another study that compared the Maglumi IgG/IgM and Euroimmun IgG/IgA, 100% sensitivity was observed with Maglumi IgG 10 days following onset of symptoms. These authors reported a lower sensitivity for the Maglumi IgM (60%) compared to the Euroimmun IgA (100%) [13] . In the current study, the Maglumi IgG/IgM tests also showed overall lower sensitivity than the Euroimmun IgG/IgA test (64.3% vs 84.4%), but in contrast, their specificity increased to 100%. The mean days since symptom onset in the population tested for this study was 11.46 days (median of 10 days). This can explain the lower sensitivity of the Maglumi IgG/IgM tests in our study as compared to those in the literature. Obka et al. [8] also described higher sensitivity observed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in the Euroimmun IgA test than in the Euroimmun IgG test (83.6% vs 61.7%). This was particularly evident in the two first weeks after symptom onset, but with less specificity for the former test (86.1% vs 98.6%).",

Similar results were reported by Li et al., showing good sensitivity (88.6%) and specificity (90.6%) with a rapid test in a large cohort of patient samples in China.

These ELISA assays provide a semiquantitative in vitro determination of human antibodies of the immunoglobulin classes IgG and IgA against the SARS-CoV-2. The microplate wells are coated with recombinant S1 structural protein. The results are evaluated semi-quantitatively by calculation of a ratio of the extinction of samples over the extinction of the calibrator. The ratio interpretation was as follows: <0.8 = negative, \u2265 0.8 to < 1.1 = borderline, \u2265 1.1 = positive. Borderline data were considered positive for the statistical analyses.",
