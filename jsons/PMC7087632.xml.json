Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are of special interest, because silicon is the basic material in microelectronics. The big demand for building powerful devices and the limits of the present approaches based on lithographic techniques to achieve few nanometer size components require the development of new methods. Control of the synthesis and the surface properties of SiNWs may open new opportunities in the field of silicon nanoelectronics and use the SiNWs as nanocomponents to build nano-circuits and nano-biosensors. Thanks to their nanometric dimensions, and the possible quantum confinement effect, the nanowires have interesting electronic, optical, chemical, and thermal properties.",

            "text": "The thermal stability of one-dimensional nanostructures has a major importance to its use in electronic and protonic circuits. It is well established that the melting point of a solid material can be greatly reduced when the size is reduced to the nanometer scale [4]. Yang and coworkers studied the melting and recrystallization of germanium nanowires encapsulated by a carbon film. Two important phenomena have been observed: the first is the low value of the melting point, which is inversely proportional to the diameter of the nanowire. The second phenomenon concerns the large hysteresis associated with recrystallization-fused ring [9]. Wang, Lee and colleagues found that the silicon nanostructures of various morphologies are formed at different temperatures after thermal evaporation of a mixture Si / SiO2 [10]. In addition to silicon nanowires, they observed several other silicon nanostructures with significant returns. They also found that the formation and annealing temperatures have played important roles in determining the relative ratios of these nanostructures in the final mixture. It is possible to achieve a good control over the morphology and crystallinity of the silicon nanostructures simply by varying the temperature. This result represents an important step towards the design and controlled synthesis of nanostructures knowing their thermal stability. The remarkable reduction of the melting point associated with the diameter of the nanowires has several implications. First, the annealing temperature necessary for the synthesis of a nanowire without defects could be a small fraction of the annealing temperature required for solid. It is thus possible to perform refining of the nanowires at relatively low temperatures. Second, reducing the melting point allows connecting and disconnecting the nanowires at relatively low temperatures. These opportunities can provide a new tool to integrate these dimensional nanostructures into devices and circuits. Finally, when the size of the nanowires is reduced, they can become extremely sensitive to environmental change and in particular to the fluctuation of temperature and the residual variation of the mechanical stresses.",

Phonons are the equivalent in quantum mechanics of a particular category of vibratory movements known as normal modes of vibration in classical mechanics. Given that the size of a one-dimensional nanostructure is reduced to the range of the phonon mean free paths, the thermal conductivity will be reduced, due to the dispersion caused by the defects. Theoretical studies have suggested that in nanowires with a diameter less than 20 nm, the phonon dispersion relation may be changed (due to the confinement of phonons) such that the speed of a group of phonons would very significantly well below their speed in the bulk [11]. Molecular dynamic simulations have also shown that the thermal conductivities of the silicon nanowires may be two times smaller than those of a silicon substrate at room temperature. The reduction in thermal conductivity is desirable in certain applications such as cooling and thermoelectric power generation, but are not preferred for other applications such as electronics and photonics.",

One of the most popular terms in the nano world is quantum confinement effect which is essentially due to changes in the atomic structure as a result of direct influence of ultra-small length scale on the energy band structure. The length scale corresponds to the regime of quantum confinement ranges from 1 to 25 nm for typical semiconductor groups of IV, III-V and II-VI. In which the spatial extent of the electronic wave function is comparable with the particle size. As a result of these \u201cgeometrical\u201d constraints, electrons \u201cfeel\u201d the presence of the particle boundaries and respond to changes in particle size by adjusting their energy. This phenomenon is known as the quantum-size effect.

The origin of this photoluminescence produced by light excitation of some solid pigments is probably due to the quantum confinement effect, although the surface condition may also make additional contributions [13]. It is important to note that the change in the growth direction of the silicon nanowires leads to different optical responses. For example, oriented nanowires {100} showed a more intense luminescence than that observed with {110} oriented nanowires. Furthermore, the excitement of {100} oriented nanowires require more energy than that required for {110} oriented nanowires.",

The method includes sublimating a mixture of Fe/Si at 1200 \u00b0C under an Ar pressure of 100 torr. Using this simple method, silicon nanowires with a diameter of about 15 nm and a length of between 10 and 100 \u03bcm were obtained. Figure 1a and b show images in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of nanowires obtained by this method. Figure 1a shows silicon nanowires wrapped with an oxide layer of about two nanometers. The diffraction pattern shows the crystalline nature of the nanowires. This is similar to that of a bulk silicon. The oxide layer may be chemically etched in hydrofluoric acid (Fig. 1b). The size of silicon nanowires increases with increasing pressure [18]. This technique allows, moreover, carrying out localized growth of nanowires. Indeed, iron deposition on a silicon substrate by lithography, followed by a thermal evaporation leads to synthesis of the located silicon nanowires [19, 20]. The thermal evaporation of a mixture of Si/SiO2 in the absence of a catalyst has also led to the production of silicon nanowires [21]. The nanowires are made of a crystalline core with a high density of defects surrounded by an amorphous oxide matrix [22].\n",

The fundamental process is based on metal catalyst directed chemical vapor deposition of silicon. According to this mechanism showed in Fig. 3, the anisotropic crystal growth is promoted by the presence of liquid alloy/solid interface. This technique is carried out in the presence of gold (Au) or other metal nanoparticles catalysts at high temperature. Based on Si-Au binary phase diagram, Si (from the decomposition of SiH4) and Au form a liquid alloy when the temperature is higher than the eutectic point (363 \u00b0C). The liquid surface has a large accommodation coefficient and is therefore a preferred deposition site for incoming Si vapor. After the liquid alloy becomes supersaturated with Si, Si nanowire growth occurs by precipitation at the solid-liquid interface. In principle, the diameter, the length, the composition and the electronic properties of SiNWs can be controlled during the synthesis.\n",

In this process, the diameter of the nanowires is determined by the diameter of the catalyst particles and therefore, the method provides an efficient means to obtain uniform-sized nanowires. SiNWs with narrow size distribution were obtained by using well defined catalysts (e.g., gold nanoparticles). It was possible to tune the electronic properties of the nanowires by including doping precursors in the silane gas. Boron and phosphorus-doped silicon nanowires were obtained this way [17\u201319]. Controlling the growth orientation is important for the applications of nanowires. Nanowires generally have preferred growth directions. For example, silicon nanowires grow along the {111} direction when grown by the VLS process, but can be made to grow along the {112} or the {110} direction by the oxide-assisted growth mechanism. These results demonstrate a clear preference for growth along the {1 1 0} direction in the smallest SiNWs and along the {1 1 1} direction in larger SiNWs [19]. Direct evidence for germanium nanowire growth mechanism in a VLS process has unambiguously been confirmed by conducting real-time in situ TEM studies at high temperature as shown in Fig. 4 [20]. The experiment result shows clearly three growth stages: formation of Au-Ge alloy, nucleation of Ge nanocrystal and elongation of Ge nanowire. This observation demonstrates the validity of the VLS mechanism for nanowire growth. The establishment of VLS mechanism at the nanometer scale is very important for the rational control of inorganic nanowires, since it provides the necessary underpinning for the prediction of metal solvents and preparation conditions.\n",

The mechanism proposed for the MCEE method was based on metal-induced local oxidation and anisotropic dissolution of Si substrates in aqueous oxidizing HF acid solution. They observe that the metal move preferentially along the Si (100) orientation, causing anisotropic etching. They also compare MCEE to chemical vapor deposition and Reactive Ion Etching; they conclude that MCEE is a simple, low-temperature, scalable, and speedy process. Otherwise, by using MCEE they produce vertical SiNWs of 20\u2013300 nm diameters with desirable electrical properties and orientations from mother Si wafers. Due for its flexibility in wafer scale production and vertically aligned SiNW arrays, MCEE has considered as a cheaper alternative to common bottom-up fabrication, in the other hand, MCEE are uniform in terms of doping profile, crystal orientation, density, size, and shape, which are essential for applications.\n",

A variety of methods have been developed and employed for structural information on the micrometer scale. Since the size of the nanowires is usually comparable or in most cases, much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, conventional optical microscopy techniques are usually limited in the characterization of morphology and the surface of nanowires. Electron microscopy techniques play, therefore, a dominant role in the characterization of nanoscale objects. The two most used techniques are the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Information on the general structure of the nanowires, such as length, diameter, and crystallinity, can be easily determined using the TEM. The composition of the nanowires can be evaluated using analysis of energy dispersion X-ray (EDX). A complete characterization includes determining the direction of growth, the cross section, the external morphology, dislocations and stacking faults. The determination of the nanowire growth direction and the cross section is important for understanding the surface energy and crystal formation mechanisms using a catalyst based synthesis process. Moreover, they provide important information for understanding these material properties that affect electronic or optical response of a device manufactured by the nanowires.",

If this transverse electric field has the effect of reducing the number of majority carriers of the semiconductor channel, then the FET works by depleting. The curve of current versus potential between two electrodes connected by the nanowire allows the characterization of NW FET electrical properties. The curve of Fig. 14 b shows the current (I) versus the potential of the transistor. The numbers on the curves indicate the transistors of the gate potential (Vg) and the small picture inset shows a current curve (I) versus a potential Vg (source-drain) Vsd equal to 1 V.

The pH change of the survey solution causes protonation and deprotonation of -NH2 and Si-OH on the surface of the nanowire [53]. The change in charge density on the surface controls the conductance of the nanowire. As the silicon nanowire was p-type, the conductance increases with the addition of negative charges at the surface of the nanowire. The combined behavior of acid and base Si-OH and NH2 on the surface results in approximately a linear dependence of the conductivity at pH in a pH range between 2 and 9. Figure 16 shows a NWFET used for pH variation detection. The NH2 terminus is obtained by chemical reaction of the oxidized surface of the nanowire with aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). The reaction of protonation/deprotonation of the nanowire leads to a charge change of its surface as a function of pH. On Fig. 16b, we see changes in conductance as a function of pH of the solution probed. An almost linear increase in the conductance as a function of the pH is observed, this change results from the presence of two distinct receptor groups, which undergo protonation/deprotonation at different pH. Figure 16d shows a silicon nanowire unmodified with an amine function. The reaction of protonation / deprotonation of nanowires which generates the change of the charge of the wire surface depending on the pH in this case only the Si-OH groups can act as a hydrogen receptor. Figure 16d corresponds to the conductance of an unmodified silicon nanowire as a function of pH (solid line) and charge density on the surface of the nanowire. In the second case there are two response regimes, one relatively low between 2 and 6 and the other most important is almost comparable to the first case for pH between 6 and 9.\n",

            "text": "Biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids are typically charged in aqueous solution, which can detect easily by NWFET probes. The first example to detect biomolecular interactions between proteins (biotin/streptavidin) in solution was demonstrated by Lieber\u2019s group [54]. In this device, the biotin molecule has been grafted onto the surface of p-type silicon nanowire oxidized and exposed to a solution containing streptavidin. This device has high sensitivity and can detect the attachment of a streptavidin with concentration less than 10 pico molar (10\u221212 moles). Figure 17a illustrates the principle of operation and detection of the biotin / streptavidin interaction. Figure 17b shows the curve of the conductance as a function of the modified silicon nanowire time. Regions 1, 2 and 3 respectively correspond to the exposure of the surface to a buffer solution, a solution of streptavidin (250 nmolar) and a buffer solution (rinse). When a solution of streptavidin is brought to the nanowires biotin modified, it is seen that the conductance increased rapidly until it reaches a constant value. This result is explained by the negative charge contributed by streptavidin, (due to the pH of the medium in which the experiment was performed) thereby inducing a charge carrier accumulation in the nanowire (p-type). Figure 17c shows a conductance curve in function of time of a silicon nanowire by unmodified biotin molecules. Regions 1 and 2 are the same as in curve B. No change in conductance was observed. This result demonstrates the specificity of the biotin / streptavidin interaction. More recently Hsiao-Kang el Al has detect the SARS virus N-protein by using In2O3 based nanowire biosensor. They found that antibody mimic protein (AMPs) can be used as capture agent in nanobisensors. By modifying the In2O3 nanowire by fibronectin-based binding agent they detect the SARS biomarker N protein selectively. They detect the N protein at a sensitivity similar to the exisiting detection methods, but within shorter time and without the labeled reagent [55].\n",

To make this device, PNA molecules (peptide nucleic acid) is immobilized on the surface of the nanowire (PNA molecules have been used for their high affinity and stability) and exposed to a solution containing single-stranded DNA molecules [57, 58]. Figure 18d shows a silicon nanowire modified with PNA molecules before and after interaction with DNA molecules. Figure 18e shows the change in conductance as a function of time before and after the DNA binding by the peptide, changing the conductance is due to the increase in negative charge of the surface due to the attachment of the DNA. The small arrow is the addition of 60 fM of a solution of DNA. Figure 18f shows the conductance versus DNA concentration. The curves with red and blue dots are made by two different devices. It is clear from this curve that the conductance increased significantly with the concentration of DNA, and that detection is possible at concentrations below 10 fM.\n",

            "text": "The use of nanowires for photovoltaic applications constitutes a promising approach thanks to their high aspect\u2013ratio. Densely packed vertical wires can improve light absorption thanks to their anti\u2013reflective and light trapping properties. However, what is even more interesting is that they offer the advantage of decoupling light absorption and carrier collection into orthogonal directions by using a radial junction: while photogenerated minority carriers are collected in the radial direction, incident light is absorbed axially. Nanowires can be as long as needed to absorb all the light and thinner than the minority\u2013carrier diffusion length. This carry the possibility of optimizing both absorption and carrier collection while using low\u2013quality materials as active PV components [60, 61]. It was Kayes et al. in 2005 who first gave a boost to the field demonstrating theoretically the benefits of using this configuration. Large efficiency gains (from 1.5 to 11 %) were predicted for silicon nanowires [60]. However, was not before 2007, when the group of Lieber reported about single p\u2013i\u2013n nanowires, that the firs experiment was demonstrated [62]. The same group compared, later on, the response of optimized p\u2013i\u2013n nanowires in axial and coaxial geometries [63]. The first attempt on contacting vertical arrays of nanowires in parallel were published by Tsakalakos et al. [64].

They succeeded in fabricating axial p\u2013i\u2013n InP nanowires arrays on p\u2013doped InP substrate with efficiences up to 13.8 %. They identified two key elements to optimize the cell performance: the nanowire diameter and the length of the top n\u2013part. Moreover, even if InP has a direct and optimal band gap (1.34 eV) for single junction devices, they understood that light absorption in nanowires does not follow the ray optics law. Actually, many works have also been focused on improving the optical absorption. Zhu et al. proposed the use of nanocones and nanodomes to gradually reduce the effective refractive index [71, 72].

            "text": "Silicon is a very promising material for the fabrication of anode (negative electrode) of the Li-ion batteries. Its theoretical charge capacity is about 4200 mAh.g\u22121 (ten times more than the graphite-372 mAh.g\u22121). This corresponds to a Li22Si5 alloy is 4.4 lithium atoms per one silicon atom. The insertion of lithium results in an increase in volume (about 400 times). The stresses exerted by these volume changes during insertion and removal of lithium cause the cracking of the silicon film and thus a loss of contact with the collector. The formation of stable and dense stable solid- electrolyte interphase (SEI) over the Si surface, is also affected by the large volume change. This (SEI) act as an ionic conducting and electronic insulation passivation layer to impede side chemical reactions to occur [73]. Thus the Si based anode suffer greatly from reduced stability and a large irreversible capacity. The capacity of the electrode therefore fall after a few cycles only [74, 75]. These volume changes are better amortized when silicon is nanostructured. These nanostructures can be nanowires [76\u201378], porous nanowires [79\u201381], silicon nanotubes saddled [82] or not [83, 84], Si nanowires with a crystal core and amorphous shell [85], Si nanowires associated with another material SnO2 [86] and Carbon (Fig. 21). The presence of a large side surface allows efficient stress relaxation and allows nanowires to better accommodate the mechanical stresses of incorporation cycles and extraction of lithium. Reported for the first time in 2008 by Cui et al. [77], this topic continues to attract much attention and several articles are published. Recently, Cui et al, have managed to get an even better stability by covering the nanostructures with PEDOT [87]. Recently Toan et Al has used highly doped silicon nanowire produced by Al-catalyzed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, as lithium-ion battery anodes, they show a good cycling behavior during the first 65 charge-discharge cycles, the electrode capacity was still 1400 mAh.g\u22121 after 150 cycles at 0.1 \u00b0C. They attribute this degradation to the delamination of the SiNWs from the stainless steel substrate on which they were grown [88].\n",
