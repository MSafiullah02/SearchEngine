            "text": "Plant-based natural products have been a potential source of lead compounds for the discovery and development of drugs. Antimalarial drugs such as artemisinin and quinine and anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel and vinblastine are some of the well-known natural products which are used for the effective treatment of the disease. The major problem associated with the natural products is poor bioavailability and limited yield. These problems are being overcome by medicinal chemists by synthesizing the natural products in good yield and by preparing their analogues with good bioavailability. The genus Calophyllum has also proved to be a potential source of lead compounds for the drug discovery and development. Calanolide A, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor isolated from the genus, is being evaluated under clinical trial. The genus is a rich source of several medicinally active compounds falling under various chemical classes. The genus includes 190 species and is classified under Calophyllaceae family. The species of the genus are identified with various distinguishing characters like red-coloured outer bark and drupe fruit. The species of the genus such as Calophyllum inophyllum is also known to be used traditionally to alleviate disease and is used in the management of leprosy. Owing to the medicinal importance of the genus Calophyllum, this chapter presents a review of its ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology.",

Now, the APG III (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group) system of flowering plant classification classifies it under Calophyllaceae family. There are 190 species in the genus, of which 179 were identified in the Old World (Africa, Asia and Europe) and only 10 species in the New World (the Americas and Oceania) (Eckenwalder 1980). These species are distributed mainly from eastern Africa to the Pacific in the Old World (Stevens 1980). The multivariate analysis by Diaz et al. showed that other American species of the genus Calophyllum are originated from this taxon (D\u00edaz 2013). The species in genus Calophyllum are difficult to classify due to the challenge of establishing distinct boundaries (Watt 2014).",

The habitat of the species ranges from wet tropical rainforest of the lowlands to drier areas at higher altitudes. Some of the species are also found in flooded areas. The genus has several distinguishing taxonomical characteristics like red-coloured outer bark with diamond-shaped fissures and presence of opposite leaves with closely and alternating parallel veins. Other characteristics of the species include axillary, terminal and raceme inflorescences. The fruits of the genus Calophyllum are drupe possessing very thin layers of flesh along with a large seed. The sepals and petals in the genus are arranged in hermaphrodite flowers. These also secrete latex which is yellow or white in colour (Eckenwalder 1980). Several species of the genus such as C. apetalum, C. bracteatum, C. caudatum, C. cordato-oblongum and C. mooni have been included in the red list of threatened species by the IUCN RedList. Furthermore, 18 species are categorized as vulnerable (viz. C. apetalum, C. caudatum, C. cordato-oblongum), 5 species as endangered (viz. C. insularum, C. morobense, C. nubicola, C. trapezifolium and C. waliense) and 3 species as critically endangered (viz. C. acutiputamen, C. africanum and C. cuneifolium) (Stevens 1980).",

The seed oil of C. apetalum is used by traditional practitioners for the treatment of leprosy (Watt 2014). The latex of the seed of C. inophyllum has also been used for the management of leprosy. The seed oil of C. apetalum and C. soulattri was used in the treatment of skin infections (Stevens 1980; Watt 2014). The infusion of C. apetalum mixed with the honey is used for treating scabies (Watt 2014). C. apetalum, C. tacamahaca and C. inophyllum are reported to be used in the treatment of rheumatism (Dorla et al. 2019; Lavergne 2001; Watt 2014). Trunk bark decoction of C. brasiliense along with the root bark of Coutarea hexandra is used for the treatment of diabetes (Yasunaka et al. 2005). Root decoction of C. inophyllum is used locally in the treatment of ulcers and the leaf decoction is used in the treatment of eye infections (10). Furthermore, infusion of the roots of C. soulattri is rubbed on the skin to alleviate rheumatic pain. The oil extracted from the seeds of C. tomentosum is used in the treatment of skin disease (Stevens 1980).\n",

The coumarins have heterocyclic structure and their biosynthesis is related to the biosynthetic scheme for neo-flavonoids. Coumarins isolated from Calophyllum exhibit various pharmacological activities and can be used as a biomarker. The coumarins of the genus are further subclassified as simple coumarins, furanocoumarins, pyranocoumarins and furo-pyranocoumarins. Calanolide A (1), costatolide (2) (also known as calanolide B), calanolide C (3) and calanolide D (4) were isolated from the fruits and twigs of C. lanigerum. Calanolide E1 (5) and calanolide E2 (6) (diastereoisomer of calanolide E1) were isolated from the stem bark of C. lanigerum (Kashman et al. 1992; McKee et al. 1996). Patil et al. (1993) isolated two tetracyclic dipyranocoumarins, i.e. calophyllic acid (7) and isocalophyllic acid (8), from the leaves of C. inophyllum. Similarly, recedesolide (9), a tricyclic pyranocoumarin, was isolated from C. blancoi (Shen et al. 2004). Shen et al. (2003) isolated inocalophyllin A (10) and B (12) along with their methyl esters (11and 13, respectively) from the seeds of C. inophyllum. Furthermore, Yasunaka et al. (2005), Gomez-Verjan et al. (2014) and Pires et al. (2014) isolated mammea-type coumarins [A/BA (14), A/BB (15) and B/BB (16)] from the leaves of C. brasiliense. Tomentolide A (17) and B (18) were isolated from the nut kernels of C. tomentosum (Nigam and Mitra 1968). Recently, a new coumarin Wallimarin T (19) was isolated from the stem bark of C. wallichianum (Fig. 5.1; Table 5.2).\n\n",

Dombakinaxanthone (46), a trioxygenated diprenylated chromen-xanthone, and calozeyloxanthone (48) were also isolated from C. moonii. (Dharmaratne and Wijesinghe 1997). Furthermore, caloxanthone (49) and pyranojacaeubin (50) possess two pyran rings. Caloxanthone G (51) possesses 2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydropyrane ring while caloxanthone B (52) possesses a furan ring. Gunasekera et al. (1977) isolated three xanthones calabaxanthone (53), trapezifolixanthone (54) and 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)xanthone (55) from the bark of C. cuneifolium. Similarly, brasixanthone B (56) was isolated from the stem bark of C. inophyllum (Mah et al. 2015) (Fig. 5.1; Table 5.2).",

Studies on its mechanism of action showed that these compounds inhibit reverse transcriptase enzyme and are classified as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Creagh et al. 2001). Researchers from the National Cancer Institute studied anticancer potential of Malaysian trees in Sarawak\u2019s forest. Unfortunately, they did not get any anticancer compound; instead they found an anti-HIV compound calanolide A from leaves and twigs of C. lanigerum. The isolated compound calanolide A showed complete protection against HIV-1 replication, with an IC50 of 5.9 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcM. The relocation efforts of the tree were failed and percentage of calanolide A was very less in other species of the genus Calophyllum. Further research showed that calanolide B, an isomer of calanolide A, is slightly less active. Calanolide B has the advantage of being readily available from the latex without causing any harm to the trees (Kashman et al. 1992). The development of calanolides was licensed by NCI/NIH to MediChem Research, Inc. (now Advanced Life Sciences) which negotiated an agreement with the Sarawak State Government for the development of calanolides as an anti-HIV drug. A joint venture company named Sarawak Medichem Pharmaceuticals was incorporated for the development of the lead molecule. After the joint venture arrangement proved unworkable, the lead role in the development was transferred to a Sarawakian company named Craun Research Sendirian Berhad. MediChem Research successfully synthesized (+)-calanolide A which is in early clinical trials, while (\u2212)-calanolide B is in preclinical development. 11-Demethyl-12-oxo, an analogue of calanolide A, possesses comparable in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity and is used as a template to study structure\u2013activity relationship of other congeners (Hanna 1999).",

Calanolide A, isolated from the genus Calophyllum, has shown potential anti-HIV activity and continues to be in the clinical developmental stage. The dependence of calanolide A availability on isolation from the natural source has posed a problem in its further development. Various synthetic routes and alternative sources of the compounds with better yields are being explored to overcome this problem. Further studies to explore the molecular mechanism of the phytochemicals need to be done to exploit it for health benefits.",
