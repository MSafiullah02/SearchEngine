The former binds to sialic acids on target cells to initiate virus infection and the latter cleaves sialic acids to allow virus release.1 The haemagglutinins of human influenza viruses preferentially bind to \u03b12-6 sialic acid receptors whereas the haemagglutinins of avian influenza viruses bind to \u03b12-3 sialic acid receptors.2 The functional balance of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities has roles in viral pathogenicity, replication efficiency, and transmissibility.3 Influenza A viruses are classified into various subtypes on the basis of the antigenicity of their haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. In addition to subtypes H1, H2, and H3 of seasonal influenza A viruses, subtypes H5, H7, H9, and H10 have been reported to cause infections in human beings.1, 4 Influenza A H6N1 virus has been isolated from migrating birds and domestic poultry in many continents.5, 6, 7, 8 It is thought to be of low pathogenicity for avian species and has caused outbreaks in poultry with slight morbidity and mortality.8, 9 Infection with H6N1 has been prevalent in domestic chickens in Taiwan since 1972.9 The virus circulating among Taiwan poultry is of a genetically unique lineage, different from that circulating in Hong Kong and southeast China, and has shown the potential for cross-species infection of mammals.9\n",

Influenza A virus was identified by immunofluorescence assay as described elsewhere.10 The isolated virus was confirmed as influenza A virus (targeting the matrix gene), but tested negatively for H1, and H3 subtypes using real-time RT-PCR assays, as described elsewhere.11 The clinical specimen and unsubtyped isolate of the patient were sent to the Taiwan CDC. The unsubtyped influenza A virus was analysed with conventional RT-PCR using universal primer sets.12 The clinical specimen of the patient was tested later using real-time RT-PCR assay for H6 subtyping, which was confirmed on the basis of the haemagglutinin sequence of the H6N1 virus isolated in this study. The primers and probe sequences were H6-1578F (TGGTGTGTATCAAATTCTTG), H6-1706R (GCATTGCATTGARCCAT), and H6-1620P (FAM-TATAGTACGGTATCGAGCAGTCTRGT-BHQ). The clinical specimen of the patient was tested for other respiratory viruses, using 13 multiplex real-time RT-PCR/PCR reactions that were set up to detect 23 human respiratory viruses: adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, MERS-CoV), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza type 1\u20134, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus 6 and 7, bocavirus, parvovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus. The assay conditions, primers, and probes for each virus have been described elsewhere.13, 14, 15, 16 For haemagglutinin inhibition (HI) tests, H6N1 virus (A/Taiwan/2/2013 isolated from the patient) was used as the antigen to test for specific antibodies. The HI tests were done in accordance with procedures described elsewhere.17 For this test we used turkey red blood cells. We report HI titres as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that inhibited virus-induced haemagglutination. Sera that tested negative at a dilution of 1:10 were recorded as a titre of less than 10.",

Multiple sequence alignments, protein translations, and phylogenetic analyses were done based on the nucleotide sequences with MEGA5.218 and BioEdit 7.0 software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the neighbour-joining method and 1000 bootstrap replications were done to assess the reliabilities. For each gene segment, the full-length sequences of H6N1 isolated in Taiwan available on the influenza virus resource at the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)19 were selected for the construction of phylogenetic trees. The nucleotide sequences of the influenza viruses included in our study have been submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (accession numbers EPI459852\u2013EPI459859).

            "text": "On the basis of the analysis of full-length gene sequences, all gene segments of TW02/13, except PB1, had high homology (>96% nucleotide identity) with the corresponding sequences of A/chicken/Taiwan/A2837/2013 H6N1 (A2837/13) isolated from chickens in Taiwan in 2013. The PB1 gene of TW02/13 shared greatest nucleotide identity (95\u00b77%) with the older A/chicken/Taiwan/PF3/02 H6N1 (appendix). Phylogenetic analyses of the eight gene segments showed that TW02/13 belonged to an H6N1 lineage that has circulated in chickens in Taiwan since 1997. This lineage comprises all H6N1 viruses isolated in Taiwan and is separated from the viruses in Hong Kong and other regions, suggesting that all segments of TW02/13 originated from viruses in chickens in Taiwan (figure 3\nand appendix). Gene segment constellations of human TW02/13 isolate and chicken A2837/13 viruses were analysed and are summarised in figure 4\nbased on the phylogenetic topologies of the eight gene segments from viruses of this lineage. The PB2, PA, NP, NA, M, and NS segments of TW02/13 and A2837/13 were all descended from A/chicken/Taiwan/A342/05 H6N1 (A342/05). The PB1 gene of TW02/13 was evolutionarily related to A2837/13 and could be traced back to the older A/chicken/Taiwan/PF3/02 H6N1 (PF3/02). The HA gene of TW02/13 and A2837/13 clustered with A/chicken/Taiwan/0204/05 (0204/05), apart from A342/05 and PF3/02. The incongruent relation between various segments of these phylogenetic topologies suggested that TW02/13 was generated from complex interclade reassortments among A/chicken/Taiwan/A342/05 H6N1, A/chicken/Taiwan/PF3/02 H6N1, and A/chicken/Taiwan/0204/05 H6N1-like viruses in poultry in Taiwan (figure 4). The viral genetic characteristics that are associated with host adaptation, receptor binding, antiviral resistance, and pathogenesis are analysed and listed in table 2\n. The haemagglutinin cleavage site of TW02/13 did not contain additional basic aminoacids (PQIATR/G), suggesting low pathogenicity in poultry species. Analysis of the receptor binding site of the haemagglutinin protein showed a G228S substitution (H3 numbering) that is also evident in some avian H6N1 viruses in Taiwan. Based on the phylogenetic topology of HA genes, these G228S-carrying viruses formed a clade (designated as 228S in figure 3). The H6N1 viruses isolated from chickens in Taiwan after 2005 had the G228S substitution, suggesting that the 228S clade viruses have become endemic and predominant in Taiwan (figure 3). The other important signatures, Q226L substitution in haemagglutinin and E627K and D701Q in the PB2 protein, were not detected in TW02/13. PB1-F2 of TW02/13 was truncated and comprised 57 aminoacids. A 14-aminoacid deletion in the stalk region of neuraminidase was noted at position 41\u201352 and 68\u201369 of TW02/13, compared with that of A/chicken/Taiwan/ns2/99 H6N1. For the antiviral drug-related markers, TW02/13 encoded NA-275H, suggesting susceptibility to oseltamivir. In the M2 protein, TW02/13 carried a S31N substitution, conferring resistance to adamantanes. The C-terminal region of the NS1 protein of TW02 contains the sequence EPEV, which has been linked to high pathogenesis in a mouse model.20 The actual significance of each potential virulence mutation described was based on animal studies, and the pathogenesis of this influenza virus in humans remains unknown.",

A reassorted live attenuated H6N1 vaccine was reported to be highly restricted for replication and antibody response in healthy seronegative adults, despite a substantial immune response in ferrets.22, 23 These reports suggest that H6N1 virus is not adapted for human infection and is poorly immunogenic in human beings, consistent with the low HI titres of the case in our report.PanelResearch in context\nSystematic review\nWe searched PubMed on Aug 1, 2013, with the terms \u201cinfluenza\u201d and \u201cH6N1\u201d. There were no date or language limits applied to our search. The results of our search showed that human beings with influenza A H6N1 virus infection in nature has not been reported. For genetic analysis of the human H6N1 virus (A/Taiwan/2/2013), we did a BLAST search of each H6N1 gene segment on the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database on May 30, 2013. Our search showed that the sequences of the human H6N1 virus were closest to those of viruses isolated from chickens in Taiwan. We selected 45 of 205 H6N1 viruses with full-length sequences in the NCBI database of viruses with closer relation to that of A/Taiwan/2/2013, and some reference strains for phylogenetic analyses. To understand the geographical and temporal distribution of the G228S substitution of haemagglutinin in subtype H6 viruses, a total of 1539 HA sequences of H6 subtype in the NCBI database were included for analysis and 30 sequences contained the G228S substitution. Two of 30 viruses with G228S belonged to the H6N6 subtype and were isolated from a pig and duck in China in 2006 and 2010, and the other 28 viruses were H6N1 subtype isolated from chickens (n=27) and a duck (n=1) in Taiwan from 2000 to 2010.\nInterpretation\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of human infection with an avian influenza A H6N1 virus. The genetic analysis and phylogenetic relation suggest that the H6N1 isolate from the patient was highly homologous to chicken H6N1 viruses in Taiwan and had been generated through interclade reassortment. We also noted that the virus carried a human adaptation marker, G228S, in its haemagglutinin and a unique group of H6N1 viruses with G228S have circulated persistently in poultry in Taiwan since 2000.",

Her close contacts' respiratory tract illnesses and the lack of known poultry exposure for the index patient raise the question of human-to-human transmission. However, there was no laboratory evidence of human-to-human transmission. To our knowledge, no study has shown that H6N1 virus is able to transmit among mammals through aerosols.24 Because understanding the transmissibility of a novel influenza virus is of major importance to public health, further field and laboratory investigations are warranted to elucidate the mode of transmission of the virus.",

            "text": "In Taiwan, some chicken H6N1 viruses have acquired a G228S substitution in haemagglutinin since 2000 (figure 3). The G228S substitution has been reported to contribute to the specificity of haemagglutinin for the human \u03b12-6 sialic acid receptor, thereby enabling the replication and transmission of the virus within and among human beings.25 Notably, most of the H6N1 viruses isolated in Taiwan after 2005 exhibited the G228S substitution and all haemagglutinin sequences of H6N1 with the G228S substitution in the NCBI database were obtained from isolates in Taiwan, suggesting that a unique H6N1 lineage with the human-adapted G228S substitution has become endemic and predominant in poultry in Taiwan. The human H6N1 TW02/13 virus had an identical 14-residue deletion pattern of neuraminidase with avian H6N1 isolates in Taiwan. These avian H6N1 isolates with 14-residue deletion had become predominant strains in Taiwan since 2001.9 Deletion in the neuraminidase stalk seemed to be associated with adaptation and virulence of aquatic viruses in chickens;26 it should be carefully monitored and assessed for a possible relation between NA deletion and human adaptation. These viruses continue to evolve and accumulate changes, increasing the potential risk of avian-to-human transmission. Regarding the origin of human H6N1 TW02/13 virus, Yuan and colleagues27 analysed our submitted sequences and speculated that the virus was derived from the reassortment of H5N2 and H6N1 viruses. However, the six internal genes of Taiwan chicken H5N2 virus have been shown to originate from the Taiwan chicken H6N1 viruses.28 Therefore, we propose that the human H6N1 virus was probably generated through interclade reassortment among H6N1 viruses. Previous studies have shown that the H6N1 virus has the potential to serve as a scaffold virus, which provides internal gene segments to reassortants.28, 29, 30 H6N1, H9N2, and H5N1 viruses in southeast China might exchange their gene segments.29 The H5N2 strains circulating in Taiwan have six segments originating from the H6N1 strain.28 It was of concern that if the reassortment happened between the H6N1 virus and other influenza viruses, it would increase the genetic diversity and allow the emergence of new pathogenic influenza strains that might infect human beings.",
