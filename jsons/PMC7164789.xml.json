Our search did not identify any reports of trends and epidemiological features of infectious diseases in China in the period after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. We retrieved one report from 2013 of morbidity and mortality characteristics of infectious diseases in China, and we found another report of emergence and control of infectious diseases in China before 2004, including data for 18 infectious diseases. However, the model of infectious disease prevention and control has changed significantly since 2003, when the great tragedy of the SARS outbreak revealed the shortcomings of China's infectious disease prevention system and propelled the Chinese Government to accelerate reforms. Based on literature searches in PubMed after the 2003 SARS outbreak, no complete, systematic, long-term, and comprehensive description of infectious disease characteristics and trends has been made available.\nAdded value of this study\nOur study describes the epidemiological features and evolution of 45 infectious diseases (an increase from the previous report of 18 diseases) from 2004 to the end of 2008, when major special national science and technology projects on prevention and control in China were initiated, then from 2009 up to 2013. To our knowledge, our report covers the longest period studied in post-SARS China. The increasing trend in overall incidence of infectious diseases levelled off after 2009; the annual percentage change in 2009\u201313 (2\u00b73%) was significantly lower than that in 2004\u201308 (6\u00b72%).\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe incidence and mortality of infectious diseases has varied significantly in the post-SARS era. Effective prevention and control strategies are needed for diseases with the highest yearly incidence, including hand, foot, and mouth disease, tuberculosis, and hepatitis B, and those with the fastest rates of increase\u2014ie, hydatid disease (echinococcosis), hepatitis C, and syphilis. The Chinese Government now has the authority to enforce joint multisectoral integrated prevention and control by collaboration between different departments and levels of administrations.\n",

We expressed trends as annual percentage changes (appendix p 2). We used the Z test to assess whether an annual percentage change was significantly different from zero. In describing trends, we used the terms increase and decrease when the slope (annual percentage change) was significant (p<0\u00b705). We used the term stable to refer to a non-significant annual percentage change (p\u22650\u00b705) and indicated that the incidence was maintained at a perennially stable level or that the incidence was perennially unreported or only reported sporadically.",

            "text": "In recent decades, the overall incidence and mortality of infectious diseases have shown a striking decline in China.3 This sharp fall can be attributed to effective and large-scale public health interventions and large population-based vaccination programmes. However, the notable decreasing tendency of overall incidence was reversed in the past few years, with a gradual upward trend reported,3 which we have confirmed in our study of 45 infectious diseases. Several factors could account for this increasing trend. First, the timeliness of reporting has improved, with fewer missing reports, which is attributable to great technological progress in laboratory detection and case identification. Moreover, diagnosis of infectious diseases has improved gradually in recent decades. In particular, use of PCR rapid diagnosis technologies has become widespread in hospitals at all levels. An improvement in diagnostic levels for infections would affect incidence.26 Second, because of increasing antimicrobial resistance, augmented human connectivity, and changeable human behaviour, the threat of infection continues to rise.2 In China, more than 10% of the population has moved from poor rural areas to urban centres in search of better economic opportunities, which promotes transmission of infectious diseases.3 Furthermore, imported and emerging infectious diseases are correlated with socioeconomic, environmental, and ecological factors.5 Specific strategies and measures should be designed to counteract increasing trends in hydatid disease, hepatitis C, HIV infection, syphilis, brucellosis, schistosomiasis, hepatitis E, other infectious diarrhoeal diseases, mumps, and leprosy\u2014eg, early surveillance and warning with enhanced screening, massive vector control, expansion of vaccine immunisation programmes, and reduction or exemption of treatment costs for infectious diseases. However, some discrepancies with previous reports in trends of infectious diseases (eg, schistosomiasis) need to be studied specifically in the future.27\n",

In particular, the major special national science and technology project on preventing and controlling infectious diseases began in China at the end of 2008,13 with a total investment of about US$2\u00b725 billion. The primary infectious diseases\u2014including hepatitis B, tuberculosis, and HIV infection\u2014have been contained effectively in a large-scale demonstration area (located in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Shandong, Beijing, Gansu, Sichuan, Henan, Xinjiang, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guangxi provinces), where the project has made improvements in perfecting, enhancing, and expanding screening, augmenting the vaccine immunisation programme, and reducing or exempting treatment costs for infectious diseases.21, 28, 29 In the past several decades, China has implemented various strategies to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Some strategies have been proven effective, which could also serve as a model for other developing countries. These strategies include improvements in the water supply and sanitation, improvements in the safety of blood collection, massive vector control, expanding the vaccine immunisation programme, and early surveillance and warning with enhanced screening.",

Second, incidence could also be underestimated because of ascertainment bias by self-selection, in which individuals with a specific infectious disease are more likely to avoid screening than are people without that infection. Third, overall yearly incidence of the 45 infectious diseases was affected by the constituent incidence of each infectious disease in each province; thus, overall incidence should be considered with reference to each infectious disease and province. Moreover, potential bias could affect incidence and mortality reporting because of variations in diagnostic standards, technical levels, and experimental conditions in different departments or institutions.",

We have described the epidemiological features of and changes in 45 infectious diseases (expanded from a previous report of 18 infectious diseases) during the longest period studied in post-SARS China. Moreover, although the overall incidence of infectious diseases was increasing, this trend was inflected after 2009, and 20 of 45 infectious diseases showed decreasing trends since 2004. Furthermore, incidence and mortality have varied substantially in the post-SARS era. Hand, foot, and mouth disease, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis have the highest yearly incidence, and hydatid disease, hepatitis C, and syphilis show the fastest increases. Thus, personalised and precise strategies for prevention and control of these diseases should be applied for specific populations, with an emphasis on children, elderly people, male individuals, and people living in specific regions.",
