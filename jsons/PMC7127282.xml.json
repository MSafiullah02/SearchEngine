            "text": "The genus Cryptosporidium was named at the beginning of this century, but was only recognised as a potential cause of disease in 1955, when it was found to be associated with diarrhoeic turkeys[1]. Although Cryptosporidium was subsequently found in a broad range of farm animals, its impact was neglected until the early 1980s when it was found to be a common, serious primary cause of outbreaks of diarrhoea in certain farm mammals2, 3. The fact that Cryptosporidium was found to infect humans[4], and could cause a life-threatening disease in immunodeficient people, especially AIDS patients[5], as well as the association of Cryptosporidium with waterborne-related human outbreaks of diarrhoea[6], has certainly given the parasite a more widespread recognition. It has encouraged the scientific work on Cryptosporidium in many domains, such as in the veterinary field, to some extent because animal husbandry is seen as a threatening source of infection for humans by the release of tremendous numbers of resistant oocysts in surface waters. Recent studies have revealed the heterogeneity of the Cryptosporidium sp. infecting both humans and animals, making the causal connection between animal and human cryptosporidiosis far more complex[7]. Nevertheless, the interest for cryptosporidiosis in the veterinary field arises even more from the fact that it concerns a harmful, difficult to control disease of many farm animals, that results in significant economic losses. This point will be addressed in this review.",

            "text": "The life cycle of Cryptosporidium is direct and monoxenous and it follows the patterns described for other enteric coccidia, which include a merogonic cycle with two generations of meronts, a gametogonic cycle with macrogametes, microgametes and zygotes and a sporogony (outlined in[8]). Compared with Eimeria spp., the life cycle of Cryptosporidium is characterised by a number of peculiarities, some of them of major importance for the establishment and spread of the infection and for the treatment of the disease: (i) exposure of Cryptosporidium oocysts to reducing conditions, pancreatic enzymes and bile salts, results in a high percentage of excystation. However, in contrast to most other coccidia, Cryptosporidium oocysts can liberate their sporozoites in warm aqueous solutions without any of the aforementioned special stimuli[9]. This spontaneous excystation explains, in part, the ability of Cryptosporidium to infect tissues other than the intestine, such as the conjunctiva of the eye10, 11, 12, 13and the respiratory tract10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19; (ii) the parasite develops inside the epithelial cell of the digestive or respiratory tract, although on the edge of the host cell cytoplasm and separated from it by a feeder organelle membrane. This intracellular extracytoplasmatic location is unique for the coccidia and might play a major role in the failure of many antimicrobial agents to inhibit the growth of Cryptosporidium\n[20]; (iii) two stages can cause auto-infection: the recycling type I meronts and the thin-walled oocysts. Consequently, in the absence of a protective immune response Cryptosporidium may persist inside a single host, even without further exposure to exogenous oocysts; (iv) the thick-walled oocysts are already fully sporulated when they leave the body with the faeces and are therefore immediately infectious. Thus, Cryptosporidium seems to have an extraordinary reproductive ability. In addition, the oocysts can travel a considerable distance following runoff[21], can survive for a relatively long time in an aqueous environment22, 23, and are infectious to a wide range of animals, thus having many potential excretors[20]. As a result, this parasite undoubtedly has an exceptional capacity to disseminate.",

In practice, oocyst excretion has been described as early as 3 days of age, which means that calves are already susceptible for infection during or shortly after birth37, 38, 39. Calves raised in isolation from Cryptosporidium remain susceptible to infection at older age, but the clinical signs become less severe[40]. In neonates, a great variability was observed in the severity and duration of diarrhoea due to cryptosporidiosis, even when the animals were exposed to similar conditions. In most calves diarrhoea has already began 3\u20135 days p.i., and lasted from 4 to 17 days[36]. In fattening units, where the prevalence of C. parvum is known to be high (93%), up to 38% of the calves developed a liquid diarrhoea, that could be attributed to cryptosporidiosis[41]. Cryptosporidial diarrhoea is associated with the excretion of tremendous numbers of oocysts[42]. High mortality due to cryptosporidiosis has been reported, even in the absence of other enteropathogens[43], and this would occur more often in the Belgian Blue\u2013White, and the French Limousin and Charolais meat breeds[44].",

Data from the Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre in Brussels, on the proportional occurence of viral enteropathogens and C. parvum in samples from diarrhoeic calves (Fig. 1\n), highlighted the increasing importance of Cryptosporidium. During the period July 1982\u2013June 1983 Cryptosporidium infections made up only 6.7% (3.9% as a single pathogen, 2.8% in association) of the digestive problems, whereas the impact of cryptosporidiosis was considerably greater in 1992\u20131993. Indeed, almost 40% of the diarrhoeic calves shed C. parvum; in 30.7% of the cases Cryptosporidium was the only pathogen present, and in 8.9% it was found in association with a viral infection. For comparison: rotavirus, coronavirus and BVD-virus were found as a single pathogen in, respectively, 11.2, 23.7 and 8.9% of the diagnosed samples. The decreased number of cases of rotavirus, shown in Fig. 1, is probably due to the use of commercialised rotavirus vaccines that became available halfway during the studied period (Vanopdenbosch, personal communication). The proportional occurrence of these pathogens may differ according to geographic parameters and the studied period, but in the last decade several studies described C. parvum as the most commonly detected enteropathogenic agent in calves50, 51, 52.",

There are reports of viruses other than the aforementioned ones, populating the intestine of young calves (picobirnavirus[59], calici- and astrovirus[60], adenovirus[61], enterovirus[62]and parvovirus[63]), but their pathogenicity is still uncertain. Giardia infections have also been found to be exceptionally frequent in suckling and weanling calves, although the role of this protozoan parasite in the aetiology of diarrhoea in calves remains unclear[39].

This might explain the association between cryptosporidial diarrhoea and the farm type and/or its specific hygienic conditions. Cryptosporidium infections were more common in single or multiple suckler beef herds[70]and dairy farms with multiple-cow maternity facilities[71].

            "text": "In lambs, the prepatent period oscillated between 2 and 7 days[82]and around 4 days in goat kids[83]. This period increases with a reduction in the dose of the infectious agent[84]or with an increase in the age of the animal[85]. The main clinical manifestations of cryptosporidiosis in neonate small ruminants are: apathy and depression, anorexia, abdominal pain, and mainly diarrhoea accompanied by the shedding of a large number of oocysts74, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88. The faeces are usually yellow, have a soft or liquid consistency and give off a strong unpleasant odour. In experimental infections in lambs[85]the dry weight of the faeces can drop from 24 to 10%. In milder cases of the disease the animals have diarrhoea for 3 to 5 days and in more severe cases for 1 to 2 weeks. The diarrhoea usually coincides with the period of oocyst shedding. The duration of the oocyst shedding depends on factors such as the age or immune status of the animals. The kinetics of the shedding is usually similar in experimentally and naturally infected animals. After the first 2 or 3 days of the patent period there is a progressive increase in the number of oocysts shed which reaches a maximum 5\u20136 days p.i. and drops sharply between days 10 and 15 p.i.83, 85, 89. In addition to the diarrhoea and oocyst shedding the animals characteristically manifest anorexia74, 83, 85which results in weight loss and retarded growth during the first few weeks of life[90]. Studies on the development of the lesions over the incubation period and the clinical course of the disease74, 83have shown that, over this period, the parasite mainly proliferates in the jejunum and the ileum. After the start of oocyst shedding (3 days after the start of infection) the lesions can spread to other parts of the small and large intestine.",

Other agents such as rotavirus were less important (7% of the outbreaks and 2% of the individuals). In goat kids, C. parvum was present in 40% of the outbreaks and 42% of the individuals, followed by E. coli (36 and 22%), rotavirus (14 and 22%), Clostridium perfringens (20 and 11%) and Salmonella spp. (7 and 3%)[76]. In a parallel study, it has been shown that E. coli strains isolated from diarrhoeic lambs and kids older than 4 days (mainly between 7 and 15 days old) are not generally toxigenic and belong to a large number of serogroups91, 92. In small ruminants older than 4 weeks, infections by Eimeria spp. are increasingly important accompanied by dietary changes and situations of stress[93]. The role of other intestinal protozoa such as Giardia sp. is controversial and although infection by this parasite is often diagnosed during the first month of life[94]it is not clearly associated with the production of diarrhoea39, 95.",

Between 75 and 100% of lambs born in this environment become infected in the first few weeks of life[105].

Extension of the prepatent period and reduction of oocyst shedding occur as the age of the lambs at infection increases. In a recent study, diarrhoea was only present in lambs infected at 6 days old and in a small percentage of lambs infected at 28 days old, but not in lambs infected at 56 days old. The size of the specific serum (IgG and IgA) and faecal (IgA) humoral response was similar and apparently independent of the age, suggesting the participation of mechanisms other than the humoral response in the development of protection[85]. However, a greater intestinal mucus production and increased glucoprotein concentration in the mucus was observed in animals infected at 28 or 56 days old. The kinetics of the IgA in the intestinal mucus response varied with the age of the animal at infection, the most rapid responses and highest titres occurred in animals which were older when infected (Quintanilla-Gozalo A, Wright S, Pereira-Bueno J, Rojo-Vazquez FA, Ortega-Mora LM.

Cryptosporidium baileyi has been reported in domestic chickens from Asia, Australia, Europe, North America[136]and North Africa[137]. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in chickens and other Galliformes has been studied both in outbreaks of respiratory and/or intestinal disease and in randomly selected flocks (Table 2\n). Histological observations demonstrated a similar incidence of Cryptosporidium infection in broilers and commercial egg-layer-type pullets[134]. However, limited epizootiological data suggest that the infection in the latter[126]is under-reported compared with that in broilers[136]. Goodwin et al.[148]found that 41% (23/56) of the northern Georgia broiler flocks had C. baileyi tracheitis. Parasitism rates among C. baileyi-infected flocks ranged from a low of 10% to a high of 60%. Cryptosporidium baileyi tracheitis was very highly correlated to severity of tracheitis, negatively correlated with average body weight, and correlated with airsacculitis and condemnations. This study indicated that C. baileyi infection rates in Georgia were much higher than previously suspected.",

In chickens, the synergistic effect of C. baileyi and these viruses was experimentally confirmed (reovirus[153], MDV [Abbassi H, Coudert F, Cherel Y, Naciri M.

The economic losses associated with this disease are due to poor flock performance (growth retardation and increased consumption index) and/or mortality121, 140, 141, 148. In addition, cost of therapy, although most drugs are inefficient122, 125, 142, 160, and carcass condemnation at processing due to air sacculitis15, 121, should also be taken into account. When C. baileyi occurs concurrently with immunosuppressive or other respiratory pathogenic agents, the consequences are more serious, and the losses more important15, 127, 157. Vaccination with the attenuated serotype 1 MDV can enhance the severity of subsequent cryptosporidial respiratory disease, resulting in unexpected losses (Abbassi H, Couder F, Cherel Y, Brugere-Picoux J, Naciri M. Effect of Cryptosporidium baileyi on the development of vaccinal immunity to Marek's disease in SPF chickens. In: 5th Avian Immunology Research Group Meeting. Turku, 1998, p. 7.4). Thus, the role this parasite plays in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease and the related production losses could be unexpectedly large. Therefore, avian cryptosporidiosis should not be neglected or overlooked during diagnosis.",

Thereafter, naturally occurring cryptosporidiosis in pigs has been described worldwide[163]. Experimental infections of piglets resulted only in diarrhoeic problems when the animals were inoculated before 2 weeks of age164, 165, 166. In older piglets, experimental Cryptosporidium infection did not cause clinical manifestations167, 168, 169. The prevalence of cryptosporidiosis was reported to be very low in nursing piglets168, 170, 171. Several studies demonstrated that naturally occurring cryptosporidiosis is delayed until after weaning146, 169, 171, 172, 173. The infections are mostly asymptomatic and usually of low intensity, and no statistical association between infection and clinical symptoms has been found171, 174. Previous studies have confirmed that diarrhoea in suckling and weaned piglets is usually a multifactorial problem, where mixed infections between C. parvum and E. coli or rotavirus are frequent. It has been suggested that Cryptosporidium is not an important primary agent of diarrhoea in piglets but it may be a copathogen in the multifactorial aetiology[163]. Recently, genetic analysis of the Cryptosporidium isolates from pig herds revealed that the animals harboured two distinct genotypes: a porcine genotype and a bovine genotype with distinct virulence in nude mice[175]. The zoonotic potential of the porcine genotype is still uncertain and requires further study.",

Experimental Cryptosporidium infection of rabbits resulted in high mortality and liquid diarrhoea in suckling 3-day-old rabbits, but no mortality and very discrete diarrhoea in weaned animals[177]. The parasite was found in 2\u201311% of weaned diarrhoeic Belgian rabbits[176]. In general, field outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in suckling rabbits are rarely detected and in weaned rabbits the parasite causes only subclinical enteritis.

In ruminant husbandry, the destruction of oocysts in the pens and buildings used for parturition by applying moist heat and/or chemical disinfectants, the use of abundant clean straw beds, avoidance of high stocking rates in the parturition area and the separation of healthy and ill animals during outbreaks of diarrhoea, in addition to the administration of appropriated supplies of colostrum to neonates, all help to prevent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis and to minimise mortality and morbidity in infected herds.",

Cryptosporidium parvum is the most commonly found enteropathogen during the first weeks of the life of calves, lambs and goat kids and is considered to be an important agent in the aetiology of the neonatal diarrhoea syndrome. The parasite frequently acts alone, but the losses are more pronounced when concurrent enteropathogens are present. Economic losses associated with cryptosporidiosis are retarded growth and mortality, and a number of hard to estimate costs resulting from interventions necessitated by diarrhoeic problems. Especially in small ruminants, the direct losses due to mortality caused by cryptosporidiosis alone was reported to be high. Because of the limited availability of effective drugs, hygienic measures and good management are the most valid weapons in the struggle against this disease. Avian cryptosporidiosis is an emerging health problem. In chickens and other Galliformes, cryptosporidiosis is mostly manifest as respiratory disease, although in turkeys and quails enteric forms of the disease were also reported to be responsible for morbidity and mortality. It was alarming to ascertain the unexpectedly high prevalence of C. baileyi in chicken flocks and the enhanced pathogenicity when immunosuppresive or other respiratory pathogens are present, or when birds are subjected to vaccination against other pathogens. In pigs and rabbits, Cryptosporidium spp. were reported to cause only clinical disease when administered experimentally to nursing neonates, but in these farm animals naturally occurring cryptosporidiosis is mostly asymptomatic.",
