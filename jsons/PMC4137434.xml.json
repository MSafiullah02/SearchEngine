Demographic projections estimate that the number of elderly people will double in many regions by 2030 [1]. In the past, asthma was considered mainly as a childhood disease; however, recent epidemiologic studies have indicated that asthma is highly frequent in the elderly population with its prevalence ranging from 4.5% to 12.7% [2-15]. In addition, the burden of asthma is more significant in the elderly than in their younger counterparts, particularly with regard to mortality, hospitalization, medical costs or health-related quality of life [15-20]. Nevertheless, asthma in the elderly (AIE) is still been underdiagnosed and undertreated [5,21-23].",

In Italian general population surveys, the asthma incidence rate after 40 yrs old was 2.27/1,000 person-year, which was increasingly higher with aging from the third decade of life [24]. Along with this, AIE might have a different pathophysiology than in childhood disease, resulting from complex interactions with various factors such as aging-related lung and immune alterations, epigenetic factors, environmental exposures, microbial triggers, or various comorbidities [19].",

More recently, in a major conceptual shift, reactive oxygen species have been found to be physiologically vital for signal transduction, gene regulation, and redox regulation, among others, implying that their complete elimination would be harmful. An alternative notion, termed the \"redox stress hypothesis,\" proposes that aging-associated functional losses are primarily caused by a progressive pro-oxidizing shift in the redox state of the cells, which leads to the over-oxidation of redox-sensitive protein thiols and the consequent disruption of the redox-regulated signaling mechanisms [29].",

However, the existence of specific gene products, that initiate deleterious alterations in the latter part of life, has not as yet been demonstrated [29]. As stated by Hayflick [30], genes do not directly drive the aging process, rather they indirectly modulate the potential life span by specifying a certain level of physiological fitness, determined by the efficiency of functions such as repair, turnover and replacement. Accordingly, the progression of senescent deterioration can be envisioned to be mainly dependent upon the genome-controlled efficiency of the physiological systems to maintain homeostasis, and the magnitude of the stochastic events that diminish the ability of the organism to maintain homeostasis. Thus, the pathways/mechanisms involved in resistance to various types of stress and maintenance of bioenergetic capacity and redox homeostasis may be critical in the evolution of longevity [29].",

Because of simultaneous changes in the mechanical properties of the lungs and chest wall and the interdependence of muscle groups, it is difficult to precisely quantify age-related changes of specific respiratory muscles [49]. Respiratory muscle strength, particularly that of the diaphragm, can be assessed by measuring the maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). MVV is reduced with age [50], and the clinical risks associated with such changes include diaphragmatic fatigue and potential ventilatory failure during increased ventilatory load. MIP is a measure of diaphragmatic strength and has also been shown to decrease between the ages of 65 and 85 years [51,52].",

The aging lung mimics emphysema in that both have enlarged alveoli, decreased surface area for gas exchange, and decreased elastic recoil, leading to the term \u201csenile emphysema\u201d that has been used to describe the normal aging lung. This term is not fully accurate, however, since the normal aging lung lacks airway wall destruction and distal duct ectasia classically seen in emphysema, and the changes of normal aging are more homogeneous than those of emphysema [54-56]. What is not clear is whether \u201csenile emphysema\u201d reflects aging-associated destruction of lung parenchyma or loss of supporting structures [57]. There is degeneration of the elastic fibers around the alveolar duct starting around 50 years of age, resulting in enlargement of airspaces. Dynamic CT imaging has shown emphysematous change with age [58]. However, a definitive progression to an emphysema phenotype will never be proven because this would require serial biopsies over many years.",

Although the effects of aging on adaptive immunity have been studied more extensively (they will be described later in this chapter), several features of innate immunity may also change with aging. In animal studies, macrophages have been noted to decrease their expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), their secretion of cytokines following activation, and their phagocytic ability. This decline occurs in parallel with decreasing levels of macrophage-derived chemokines [59,60]. The effect of aging on monocyte and macrophage function in humans, however, remains controversial. Although some studies suggest that aging does not affect the function of these cells, others have demonstrated an impaired cytotoxic effect of aged monocytes [62]. In addition to impaired function, monocyte/macrophage and lymphocyte recruitment to infected tissue has been shown to be delayed in elderly individuals based on a study of cutaneous punch biopsies [63].",

It has been demonstrated a higher percentage of neutrophils and a lower percentage of macrophages [64]. This increased proportion of neutrophils in BAL fluid with age was also noted in two subsequent studies by Meyer et al.[65,66]. A significant increase in total cell concentration, neutrophils, immunoglobulin content, and IL-6 concentration was observed in the BAL fluid from older adults [65,66]. BAL samples from the older individuals demonstrated more IL-8, neutrophil elastase, and several antiproteases, consistent with an increased neutrophil predominance in these older individuals [67]. These observations suggest that even asymptomatic and clinically normal older volunteers have altered inflammatory profiles, reflecting the presence of low-grade inflammation in the lower respiratory tracts. These alterations include a significant rise in the number of CD4+ T cells, neutrophils, immunoglobulins, and cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8, as well as an increase in the release of superoxide anion and other byproducts of neutrophil activation [65-67].",

There is a reduction primarily in thymic function as T cells age, and the number of na\u00efve lymphocytes in the thymic compartment as well as in the periphery is significantly reduced with aging. As a direct consequence, the actual mass of T cells and B cells probably undergoes at 25% reduction with aging. The causes of this age associated decline clearly relate to the decline in the generation of na\u00efve cells [75,76]. Nave CD4 cells isolated from older humans have decreased in vitro responsiveness to activation through T cell receptor pathways, but also through different cytokine usage and secretion patterns when compared to na\u00efve CD4 cells taken from young individuals. CD4+ T cells and loss of function of signaling proteins with aging may reduce the efficiency of this synaptic activation between antigen presenting cells and T cell receptors [76,77]. Memory T cells which are long lived and maintained by homeostatic cytokines remain relatively competent even into old age, but the numbers of these memory CD4 T cells are reduced [77]. The differences in B cell activation as aging occurs may play a potential role in the increase in significance of autoimmunity and selection on B cell clones that are not common clones that can lead to altered autoimmune immunity at the B cell level. B cell related aging also uncovers a lack of normal responses. It is also possible that memory B cells that may be maintained that are of little value in terms of maintaining a protective vaccination status with reduced T cell activation [78].",

The first is inadequate responses to vaccination as elderly individuals are vaccinated receiving pneumovax and other anti pneumonia agents, some directed at bacteria and some directed at viruses. The development of an actual significant immune response is critical in the CD4, CD8 and B cell compartments, but the reduction in size and function of these compartments correlates with difficulty in achieving proper vaccination and it should be examined in any elderly individual receiving a vaccination. Hence, the efficacy of the vaccination process needs to be tested in those individuals and the revaccination and booster activities should be put in place of those who make a less than adequate response to any vaccine. In addition, the lack of vigilance related to the T cell compartment through help of NK cells and CD8 T cells is also of consideration and potential development of both autoimmune diseases and also hypersensitivity diseases including asthma for quite possibly other lung disease including susceptibility to ARDS with infection and susceptibility to other viral lung infections [78].",

Over 80% of young children with asthma are allergen sensitized, and atopy in this age group increases disease morbidity [79,80]. Additionally, atopy plays a critical role in the inception of asthma in this age group, in particular during viral infection [23]. However, with increased recognition of asthma in older subjects, our knowledge on the role of IgE sensitization to antigens and subsequent exposure to subjects with asthma in this age group is increasing. It is well established that with increased age, total serum IgE decreases. This has been demonstrated in several cross-sectional studies of randomly selected individuals. For example, the Tucson Epidemiological Study and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2005\u20132006) reported that IgE peaks by 20 years of age and is lowest after 70 years [81,82]. However, not all studies have not supported this trend. [83,84]. Additionally, when looking at the prevalence of allergen-specific IgE, younger populations, including subjects with and without asthma, tend to have a higher prevalence of allergen-specific IgE sensitization than in older groups [83,85]. This has been reported in several longitudinal studies from cohorts of randomly selected subjects from Tucson [85], Nottingham [86], Copenhagen [87], and in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey [88].",

The reported percentage of older patients with atopic versus non-atopic asthma may depend upon the characteristics of the population studied. Studies done in non inner- city populations are variable; suggesting that 28% to 74% of older adults with asthma are sensitized to at least one antigen [90-93].

Rogers et al. reported that in an asthma clinic in New York City , that 60% of subjects > 65 years of age had at least one detectable allergen specific IgE (including outdoor allergens) and that cockroach sensitization was the most prevalent at 47% [94]. Cockroach sensitization was associated with more severe asthma as determined by airflow limitation and hyperinflation. This study did include a group of younger subjects from the same population for comparison. Another study done in New York City reported that 41% of subjects over the age of 60 years with moderate to severe persistent asthma, were sensitized to at least one antigen, whereas 73% between 18\u201335 years of age were sensitized [95]. Antigen sensitization developing later in life may contribute to late onset asthma in some patients [96,97]. In the Normative Aging Study, which followed subjects over an extended period of time, those men who developed airway hyper-responsiveness after 49 years of age were more likely to have developed recent IgE to cat (23.9% versus 4.4%) compared to age-matched controls [96]. Additionally, approximately 50% of the forty patients in the Tucson Epidemiologic study of obstructive lung diseases who developed asthma after the age of 60 years were skin prick positive to at least one antigen, compared with 26% of the age-matched control population without asthma [90]. In a study of 21 patients with asthma onset after 65 years of age, 81% demonstrated a positive skin prick test to at least one allergen compared to a group of 14 patients developing asthma before the age of 65 years in whom 57% were allergen sensitized [96]. A French study recruited 1,485 patients (mean age 73 years) with a diagnosis of asthma to examine disease characteristics. 14.7% of those developing asthma after 65 years of age were sensitized to at least one antigen by skin prick testing, whereas 60.1% of those developing asthma prior to 21 years of age were antigen sensitized [91].",

An important unanswered question is, what is the role of allergen exposure in sensitized older patients with asthma on disease pathogenesis and severity?",

Particularly, it is suggested to have relationships with intrinsic asthma [101], or severe non-atopic late-onset asthma [102]. In recent GA2LEN surveys, the prevalence of SE IgE sensitization was 29.3% in the European adult populations, which was higher than that of house dust mite (14.9%) [100]. Of note, they found that the SE sensitization was positively related to smoking history and aging. As Staphylococcus aureus is a frequent colonizer in the upper airways and skins, the airway epithelial disruption by repeated smoke exposure [103] or the reduced cutaneous barrier function by aging process [104] could contribute to the SE IgE sensitization. Thus, \u2018aging\u2019 could be a predisposing factor for SE sensitization and also for developing asthma in later adult life among susceptible subjects. Although there is still no direct evidence, the collective evidence suggests the potential contributions of SE sensitization on the nature of elderly asthma. The atopic condition in the geriatric age group represents an additional tool in the diagnostic process and, consequently, in the therapeutic approach [105].",

The result is a decrease in FEV1/FVC, such that normal elders have spirometric features suggestive of obstructive lung disease. Thus, the diagnosis of AIE is challenging, and AIE is commonly misdiagnosed as COPD resulting in the under-diagnosis and under-treatment of asthma [126]. Significant, irreversible airflow obstruction in older adults is usually due to COPD, while remodeling or bronchiectasis with segmental fibrosis is more characteristic of older adults with asthma. Patients with COPD often have increased lung volume (air trapping), reduced diffusion capacity, and emphysematous changes on high resolution tomographic imaging (often absent on chest radiographs). When these findings are present, patients with persistent dyspnea and reduced FEV1 of less than 60% predicted are more likely to have COPD than AIE [127].",

The major differences are the degree of reversibility is often greater in asthma and the persistence of dyspnea is greater in COPD. Both are characterized by exacerbations which respond to corticosteroids and bronchodilators, infections triggering exacerbations, episodic wheezing, cough with or without mucous production, improvement with chronic inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators, and decreased exercise tolerance. The chronic bronchitis phenotype of COPD as opposed to the emphysematous phenotype is more likely to be confused with asthma, but the variations of phenotypes in both diseases confounds simple measures to reliably distinguish one from another [126,127]. The major distinguishing clinical features between the two diseases are personal or family history of atopy and/or asthma with symptoms starting in childhood being more likely with asthma; cigarette smoking history and adult onset of symptoms being more likely in COPD; and increased biomarkers including fractional exhaled nitric oxide, peripheral and sputum eosinophil and serum total and specific IgE being more likely with asthma [95]. However, exceptions are not unusual, and the LOA phenotype may not exhibit many of the distinguishing factors for asthma [127].",

Infections are the most important triggering factors, similar to COPD [126,127]. Compared to the younger asthmatic, the role of specific IgE in AIE is decreased, and a positive family history of asthma is less common, particularly in the LOA phenotype [95]. In addition, due to changes in the skin from normal aging and damage from sun exposure in the elderly, the responses of skin testing are smaller in induration, have less erythema and are less consistent. Thus, the interpretation of both allergen skin tests and in vitro specific IgE testing is confounded in the elderly [95,130]. Peripheral blood or airway eosinophilia, characteristic of asthma is useful in distinguishing COPD from asthma. Also the severity of upper airway disease is likely to be more significant in asthma compared to COPD [126,127].",

CRS may be phenotyped as CRS without (CRSsNP) and with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), based on symptoms (loss of smell is typical for CRSwNP, headache and facial pain are typical for CRSsNP), nasal endoscopy (presence of bilateral nasal polyps) and CT scanning.

Poor treatment adherence, inappropriate inhaler use, or depression were found to be independent predictors for asthma exacerbation in the elderly [158]. An important benefit of education could be in improving adherence to treatment and improving self-management skills. In this regard, adherence to therapy has been often reported as deficient in the elderly. Frequent patient follow-up visits and monitoring for medication adherence, including proper inhalation technique is encouraged. Some patients may also find it difficult to implement a written action plan in the event of an acute exacerbation, and the immediate availability of an asthma educator (by phone or in person), would be ideal [159-161]. The technique of device inhaled medication administration is a difficult problem in elderly patients, and the great majority of elderly patients can not properly use the inhaler, even after the proper instruction [162,163]. The use of dry powder devices, although easy to use, requires the generation of an adequate inspiratory flow can be sub-optimal in fragile patients and those with severe airway obstruction. In such situations, the use of spacers or nebulizer devices may be beneficial. Patients should recognize the rationale behind the use of different drugs, the correct way to use them, and their side effects and polypharmacy with more devices should also be avoided.",

The diagnosis of AIE in older populations relies on the same clinical findings and diagnostic tests used in younger populations, but the interpretation of the clinical data is more challenging. The possibility of multiple causes of symptoms or physical dysfunction is more likely in the aged. The response to drugs may also be less interpretable. There are several reasons why a physician should strive to make a specific diagnosis for a patient presenting with a symptom complex. Just providing the patient with a disease diagnosis or label can be reassuring to the patient. Moreover, advancement of understanding of the epidemiology, natural history, pathobiology, and treatment require a definable disease entity.
