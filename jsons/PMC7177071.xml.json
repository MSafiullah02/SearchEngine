In another study, SARS-CoV was shown to cause diabetes by ACE2-dependent infection of pancreatic isle cells (10). Interestingly, the significantly enriched \u201ccAMP signaling\u201d pathway is an indirect link between diabetes and ACE2 signaling, based on experimental evidence associating cAMP levels and ACE2 activity in diabetic patients (11) (False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05); Table 1\n. Following entry to host cells, lipid metabolism is a subsequent important target of single strand RNA viruses, critical for the formation of the viral envelope in subsequent lifecycles (12). Autophagy mediated triglyceride and lipid droplet catabolism is one such mechanism, as identified in DENV infection (13). Hijacking the host cells\u2019 lipid metabolism has been shown to be a critical step in establishing HCoV-22E and MERS - coronavirus latency (14). In SARS-CoV patients, alterations in lipid metabolism have been detected as far as 12 years after the initial infection (15).",

While the approach presented here is inherently limited due to setting its basis on the SARS-CoV proteomic interactions, it nevertheless presents in silico and literature evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 potential to affect human metabolism. Furthermore, as genes affected by SARS-CoV infection are significantly enriched for other infections, they may represent a common interface, targeted by viruses.
