Since its inception in 2007, PAN has hosted 22 shared tasks at 21 different events with continually increasing reception within the community. The latest installment of PAN at CLEF 2019 had a strong focus on authorship analysis, featuring tasks on author profiling, celebrity profiling, authorship attribution, and style change detection. Continuing in 2020, PAN will again organize four shared tasks in these domains. The first task, profiling fake news spreaders on Twitter, addresses the critical societal problem of fake news from the perspective of author profiling, by studying stylistic deviations of users inclined to spread them. The second task, crossdomain authorship verification, studies the stylistic association between authors and their works in a setting without the interference of domain-specific vocabulary. The third task, celebrity profiling, analyzes the presumed influence that celebrities have on their followers to study whether celebrities can be profiled based on their followership. The fourth task, style change detection, continues the research on multi-author documents by attempting to separate segments of a document based on authorship.",

This helps in identifying profiling aspects such as age, gender, and language variety, among others. In the years 2013-2018, we addressed several aspects in the shared tasks we organized at PAN. 1 In 2013, the aim was to identify gender and age in social media texts for English and Spanish [22] . The corpus included chat lines of potential pedophiles with the purpose of investigating the robustness of the best-performing systems also from this perspective (i.e., identifying the age of the pedophiles). Age classes included a gap in between: 10s (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) , 20s (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) , 30s (33-48). Results in both languages and in both subtasks were below 70% accuracy.",

The best results were obtained on Twitter, where users showed a more spontaneous way to communicate [20] . In 2015, apart from age and gender identification, we addressed also personality recognition in Twitter in English, Spanish, Dutch and Italian. The best results (above 80% accuracy) were obtained on English data [24] . In 2016, we addressed the problem of cross-genre gender and age identification (training on Twitter data and testing on blogs and social media data), in English, Spanish, and Dutch. The best results were obtained on blogs for English with an accuracy above 75% for gender and below 60% for age identification [25] . In 2017, we addressed gender and language variety identification in Twitter, in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic. The lowest results were obtained for Arabic with an accuracy of 80% for gender and 83% for language variety identification [23] . In 2018, our aim was to investigate if approaching gender identification in Twitter from a multimodal perspective (e.g., considering also images of the links in tweets) could improve results. The corpus was composed of English, Spanish, and Arabic tweets. Only for Arabic it was possible to improve accuracy (albeit less than 2%) [21] .",

Advanced bots that generated human-like language, also with metaphors, were the most difficult to be profiled. It is interesting to mention that when bots were profiled as humans, they were mostly confused with males [19] .

Recently fake news detection has gained a lot of attention from the research community. Indeed, their early detection can prevent further dissemination of false claims and rumors, but it's a hard and time-consuming task, since they involve manual annotation. Recent approaches that have been proposed [6, 7, 16] are effective in detecting false claims that already have been disseminated, but not the newly emerging ones. In addition, these models do not take into account the role of users that unintentionally or intentionally share the false claims and who play a critical role in their propagation. To this end, in this task, we aim at identifying and profiling fake news spreaders on social media as a first step towards preventing fake news from being propagated among online users. We propose a new task that focuses on fake and real news spreaders detection. The detection of accounts that are possible spreaders of fake news is very important for the field of misinformation detection. These accounts could be operated by laymen [2] , \"professional\" trolls [4] , and even bots [14] . The fake news spreaders might be identified from several possible perspectives: textual, semantic, sentiment, social variables, etc. Previous work [5] showed that word embeddings and style features are important to profile such accounts, whereas other information, such as hashtags, is not useful.",

Celebrities can contribute much to author profiling research: they are prolific social media users, often supplying extensive writing samples as well as personal details. Celebrities build a consistent public persona either themselves or with the help of public relations agents. In addition, celebrities are in a unique position within their communities: they are highly influential on their followers, frequently considered trustworthy and reliable, and they act as hubs for like-minded people on social media. Celebrity Profiling [30] is the newest addition to PAN's shared tasks. In 2019 [31] , the goal was to determine the demographics age, gender, occupation, and fame from the timelines of celebrities on Twitter. Eight participants submitted solutions, which, given sufficient training data, performed well on demographics with a coherent separability by topic or domain. Poor performance was achieved in cases where certain demographics are rare (e.g., non-binary genders), or where they are underrepresented (e.g., age groups for very low and high ages). Also domain-invariant demographics, like the scientific creative occupations, posed problems. The results of the first shared task on celebrity profiling are coherent with most of the related work in author profiling, authorship analysis, and computational stylometry in general: the domain-specific vocabulary is the primary discriminator and demographic differences are often reflected by topics.",

The formation of closely connected communities around celebrities, who are also under their influence, allows us to investigate the role of author characteristics, domain, and demographic on language use. For the upcoming edition of celebrity profiling, we focus on separating a celebrity author's textual characteristics from domain-specific language use, using the demographics as an indicator. Instead of predicting the authors demographics from his text alone, we use the texts of highly influenced individuals, while the prediction targets remain largely the same as last year (age, gender, occupation). The results of this shared task will help us to determine for the first time, whether and to what extent an influencer's demographics and characteristics can be predicted from his or her followers. Tangible applications, besides academic interest, include methods to profile users with few own text samples, and to judge influence exerted between users in a community.",

These communities crucially rely on trustworthy, transparent benchmark initiatives that reliably establish the state of the art in the field [17] . Author identification is concerned with the automated identification of the individual(s) who authored an anonymous document on the basis of text-internal properties related to language and writing style [9, 12, 27] . At different editions of PAN (since 2007), author identification has been studied in multiple incarnations: AUTHORSHIP ATTRI-BUTION: given a document and a set of candidate authors, determine which of them wrote the document (2011-2012, 2016-2020); AUTHORSHIP VERIFICATION: given a pair of documents, determine whether they are written by the same author (2013-2015); AUTHORSHIP OBFUSCATION: given a document and a set of documents from the same author, paraphrase the former so that its author cannot be identified anymore (2016-2018); OBFUSCATION EVALUATION: devise and implement performance measures that quantify safeness, soundness, and/or sensibleness of an obfuscation software (2016) (2017) (2018) .",

Fan writers actively aim to increase their readership and on most platforms (e.g., archiveofourown.org or fanfiction.net), the bulk of writings can be openly accessed, although the intellectual rights are not unproblematic [29] .

Authorship verification can be formalized as the task of approximating the target function \u03c6 : (D k , d u ) \u2192 {T, F }, where D k is a set of documents of known authorship by the same author and d u is a document of questioned authorship. If \u03c6(D k , d u ) = T , then the author of D k is also the author of d u and if \u03c6(D k , d u ) = F , then the author of D k is not the same with the author of d u . In crossdomain settings, D k and d u do not share topic, genre or even language (in our case the fandom is different). A simple form of the verification task is to only consider the case where D k is singleton, thus only pairs of documents are examined. Given a training set of such text pairs, verification systems can be trained and calibrated to analyze the authorship of unseen pairs. Such verifiers produce a score in the form of a bounded scalar between 0 and 1, indicating the probability of the test item being a same-author pair (rather than a binary choice).",

(II) Systems are known to be very sensitive to changes in domain and topic: whether or not train and test pairs are extracted from the same fandom(s) will strongly affect performance [1] . Including multiple fandoms into training and/or test pairs is another valuable aspect for experimentation. (III) Overfitting on specific authors is a real danger during training: allowing authors to contribute more than one text during the construction of training pairs might affect performance. Likewise, one explicitly can vary the number of test authors (if any) that have not been encountered in training.

Detecting these positions is a crucial part of the authorship identification process, and for multi-author document analysis in general-documents which have not been studied a lot to date. This task has been part of PAN since 2016, with varying task definitions, datasets and evaluation procedures. In 2016, participants were asked to identify and group fragments of a given document that correspond to individual authors [26] . In 2017, we asked participants to detect whether a given document is multi-authored and if this is indeed the case, to determine the positions at which authorship changes [28] . However, this task was deemed as highly complex and hence, was relaxed in 2018, asking participants to predict whether a given document is single-or multi-authored [11] . Given the promising results achieved, in 2019, participants were asked to firstly detect whether a document was single-or multi-authored and, if it was indeed written by multiple authors, to predict the number of authors [32] .",

We aim to steer the task back to its original goal: detecting the exact position of authorship changes. Therefore, the task for PAN'20 is to find the positions of style changes at the paragraph-level. For each pair of consecutive paragraphs of a document, we ask participants to estimate whether there is indeed a style change between those two paragraphs. This binary classification task will be performed on a dataset curated based on a publicly available dump of a Q&A platform to cover different types of documents at different lengths and topics. We will distill two different datasets: one featuring a rather narrow set of topics being discussed, and a second dataset containing a broad variety of topics. This setup allows for analyzing the performance of the developed approaches in dimensions of text length, topics, and the number of contributing authors.",
