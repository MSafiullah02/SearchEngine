            "text": "Polyploidy or whole\u2010genome duplication (WGD) has long been recognized as an important process in plant evolution (Otto & Whitton 2000; Soltis et al. 2009). At least one round of WGD occurred before the divergence of seed plants (Jiao et al. 2011), and multiple rounds of WGD have been reported in angiosperms (Vision et al. 2000; Simillion et al. 2002; Bowers et al. 2003; also see review by Leitch & Leitch 2012). Polyploidy may have broad\u2010scale effects on genomic repatterning, gene expression and genetic networks due to the inheritance of an additional set of chromosomes, and can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system and ecological tolerances (Otto 2007; Soltis et al. 2010; Fawcett et al. 2013; Weiss\u2010Schneeweiss et al. 2013), although some studies found no correlation between polyploidization rate and species richness (Wood et al. 2009; Mayrose et al. 2011). While it has been recognized that a polyploid species often has multiple origins (see review by Soltis et al. 2014a), it remains challenging to evaluate the direct effect of polyploidy on evolutionary success of the species (Madlung 2013; Soltis et al. 2014b). Moreover, although some studies indicate that ecological divergence is an important driver of polyploid speciation, especially allopolyploid speciation (Fawcett et al. 2009, 2013; Van de Peer et al. 2009; Ramsey 2011), it remains unresolved whether diploid and polyploid plants can share broad\u2010scale climatic niches (Glennon et al. 2014).",

When excluding three species of conifers, that is the two tetraploids Juniperus chinensis \u2018Pfitzeriana\u2019 and Fitzroya cupressoides and the hexaploid Sequoia sempervirens (Ahuja 2005), the remaining natural polyploids of gymnosperms all belong to the genus Ephedra, in which 50\u201365% of species show tetraploid or very rarely octoploid cytotypes (Khoshoo 1959; Huang et al. 2005). It is of interest to investigate why and how so many polyploids have evolved in this genus.",

These species originated by radiative speciation in the Cenozoic with a crown age of about 30 Ma (Ickert\u2010Bond et al. 2009), although the earliest fossil record of the genus is from the Early Cretaceous (Yang & Wang 2013). As a secondary diversification centre, the Qinghai\u2013Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjacent regions harbour approximately 16 species of Ephedra (Fu et al. 1999; Yang 2002; Yang et al. 2003), of which nine were reported to be polyploids or have polyploid cytotypes, including E. distachya, E. equisetina, E. gerardiana, E. glauca, E. intermedia, E. likiangensis, E. monosperma, E. saxatilis and E. sinica. All of the 16 species form a monophyletic clade with several other species from northern and western Asia and Horn of Africa (Huang & Price 2003; Rydin & Korall 2009) and are generally geographically isolated from the other species of the clade, whereas the nine polyploids are respectively located in three well supported subclades, southern QTP, eastern QTP and northern China (Qin et al. 2013). It was inferred that the subclade divergence occurred in the Miocene and was very likely linked to the uplift of the QTP and the Asian aridification (Qin et al. 2013). However, the origin of these polyploid species remains unknown.",

Also, in recent years, the whole\u2010genome or whole\u2010transcriptome analysis has greatly advanced our knowledge of origin and evolution of polyploids in angiosperms (e.g. Roulin et al. 2012; Page et al. 2013; Renny\u2010Byfield et al. 2013). However, genome sequencing of any gymnosperm remains a huge and expensive task, although a draft assembly of the genome has been generated for a couple of conifers, including Norway spruce (Nystedt et al. 2013), white spruce (Birol et al. 2013) and loblolly pine (Neale et al. 2014). Therefore, current phylogenetic analysis using single\u2010/low\u2010copy nuclear genes is still the best approach for exploring the evolution of polyploids in Ephedra.",

This study aims to investigate the origin and evolution of polyploids of Ephedra distributed in the QTP and neighbouring areas. First, flow cytometry was used to measure ploidy levels of the sampled species, most of which were represented by multiple individuals from different populations. Then, two single\u2010copy nuclear genes (LFY and DDB2) and two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments (trnT\u2010trnF and trnS\u2010trnfM) were used to investigate whether these polyploids are allopolyploids or autopolyploids and which species could be the maternal donors of the allopolyploids. Finally, based on a comprehensive analysis of biological attributes, phylogenetic relationships, geographical distributions and ecological factors of the habitats, we discussed the possible correlation between allopolyploid speciation and some biological and ecological features.",

Young branchlets were collected from the individuals that were at least 50 m apart from each other. The remaining four species that also occur in the QTP and neighbouring areas, namely E. distachya, E. lomatolepis, E. rituensis and E. fedtschenkoae, were not included in the study due to the controversy of their species status (Fu et al. 1999; Yang 2002; Yang et al. 2003), or a lack of enough population samples. Among them, E. fedtschenkoae seems unique in being monoecious, but Florin (1933) reported that monoecious individuals are common in Ephedra. The other three species are tetraploids based on previous studies (e.g. Leitch et al. 2001) and our preliminary investigation. Therefore, the exclusion of these species should not greatly affect our inference about the origins of other tetraploid species (mostly allotetraploids, see Results).",

In Ephedra, the leaves are reduced to small membranous sheaths. Therefore, we used the silica gel\u2010dried young branchlets for the FCM measurement, mainly following the protocol of Suda & Tr\u00e1vn\u00ed\u010dek (2006). Approximately 0.3 g silica gel\u2010dried branchlets per individual was chopped with a razor blade in a Petri dish containing 1 mL of Otto I buffer (0.1 mol/L citric acid monohydrate, 0.5% (v/v) Tween\u201020, pH 2\u20133). After filtering through a 50\u2010\u03bcm nylon mesh and centrifuging at 100 g for 8 min, the pellet was resuspended in 200 \u03bcL buffer of a 1:2 mixture of Otto I and Otto II (0.4 mol/L Na2HPO4 12H2O) and stained with 50 \u03bcg/mL PI including 50 \u03bcg/mL RNase. The FCM measurements were taken using an Elite flow cytometer (BD FACSCalibur, USA). To guarantee the reliability of the measurements, several samples were reanalysed (up to four times) on different days to assess between\u2010run fluctuations, and the results showed that the measurements are very consistent. If the coefficient of variation (CV) of the histogram peak exceeded 5%, the sample was discarded or remeasured. The DNA ploidy levels were inferred based on DNA contents measured in plants with known chromosome numbers. That is, based on chromosome number counts (see Results), the two species of Ephedra, E. equisetina (2n = 14, diploid) and E. intermedia (2n = 28, tetraploid), were used as external reference standards, with their DNA contents measured and shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting information).",

Therefore, the FCM fluorescence histograms of the two samples, as shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting information), were used to represent diploid (2x) and tetraploid (4x) nuclei, respectively. The peak ratio of E. intermedia to E. equisetina is 1.98. For all the Ephedra samples (12 species, 48 populations and 248 individuals) analysed by FCM, none of the CV values exceeded 5%. Based on the peak positions that indicate the relative DNA contents, the fluorescence histograms could be clearly divided into two cytotypes, corresponding to diploids and tetraploids, respectively. The peak ratios of diploids to E. equisetina ranged from 0.95 to 1.08, and those of tetraploids to E. intermedia ranged from 0.94 to 1.07. The FCM measurement indicated that three species (E. gerardiana, E. przewalskii and E. regeliana) harboured both diploid and tetraploid cytotypes, four species (E. equisetina, E. minuta, E. monosperma and E. rhytidosperma) showed only the diploid cytotype, and six taxa (E. likiangensis, E. glauca, E. intermedia, E. saxatilis, E. saxatilis var. mairei and E. sinica) exhibited only the tetraploid cytotype (Table 1).",

Like E. likiangensis, E. saxatilis var. mairei is higher in BIO3, BIO12 and BIO18 except the comparison between it and E. gerardiana in BIO3 (Fig. S5S\u2013U, Supporting information). The allotetraploid E. sinica also shows niche divergence from most of its putative progenitors and tends to occupy a niche with higher BIO12, BIO15 and PET (Fig. S5V\u2013X, Supporting information).",

Phylogenetic analysis of single\u2010/low\u2010copy nuclear genes can be effective in revealing allopolyploid parental lineages (e.g. Ge et al. 1999; Ferguson & Sang 2001; Kim et al. 2008; Cai et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2012a, b; Kelly et al. 2013), when an allopolyploid species, particularly of recent origin, has paralogous sequences inherited from its two or more parental species. These paralogues can place an allotetraploid in different parental clades. In the present study, the FCM measurement of the ploidy levels in a number of individuals from different populations indicates that six (46%) of the studied 13 Ephedra taxa, including E. glauca, E. intermedia, E. likiangensis, E. saxatilis, E. saxatilis var. mairei and E. sinica, are tetraploids (Table 1). In both single\u2010copy nuclear gene trees (LFY and DDB2), each of the six taxa contains two types of sequences that are distributed in different major clades A and C or B and C (Figs 5 and 6), strongly suggesting an allopolyploid origin involving diploid parents from these clades. Compared to clades A and C, clade B only contains tetraploids. This could be attributed to the extinction or lack of sampling of diploids in this clade.",

The chlorotypes of E. saxatilis belong to lineage III (Fig. 2), and are narrowly distributed in southern QTP (Fig. 1), corresponding to the geographical distribution of this species. Hence, this species possibly originated by allopolyploidy with a maternal progenitor from southern QTP, very likely the diploid cytotype of E. gerardiana (in lineage III of Fig. 2 and clade C of Fig. 5), and a paternal progenitor from clade B (Fig. 6). However, as mentioned earlier, the ancient diploids in clade B could be currently extinct. The chlorotypes of E. likiangensis belong to lineage II with a relatively wide distribution (Figs 1 and 2), and thus, its maternal progenitor could be a diploid species in this lineage, such as E. equisetina, E. minuta and E. monosperma (with nuclear gene alleles in clade C), whereas its paternal progenitor should belong to clade B (Figs 5 and 6). The E. saxatilis var. mairei harbours a high frequency of chlorotypes of lineage III and a much lower frequency of chlorotypes of lineage II (Figs 1 and 2). Therefore, the maternal progenitor of this taxon could be diploid species from the two lineages such as E. gerardiana (2x), E. equisetina, E. minuta and E. monosperma, and its paternal progenitor could be from clade B (Figs 5 and 6).",

            "text": "Both diploid and tetraploid cytotypes are present in E. gerardiana, E. przewalskii and E. regeliana (Table 1). The tetraploids of E. przewalskii only have A2\u2010type sequences of the nuclear gene LFY (in clade A, Fig. 5) as its diploids (Figs 3 and 4), but do not share all chlorotypes with the diploids (Table 1; Fig. 1), although their chlorotypes all belong to lineage I (Fig. 2). In particular, the chlorotype H3 is shared between the tetraploids of E. przewalskii and E. glauca (Table 1; Fig. 1). Therefore, the tetraploids of E. przewalskii may be autopolyploids or young allopolyploids with very closely related parental species. In the LFY tree (Fig. 5), the tetraploids of E. regeliana harbour two subtypes of sequences in clade A, including A2 with the diploids and tetraploids of E. przewalskii and the tetraploid E. glauca, and A3 with the diploid E. regeliana and two tetraploid species (E. sinica and E. intermedia). Notably, the diploids and tetraploids of E. regeliana do not share chlorotypes (Table 1; Fig. 1). Thus, the tetraploids of E. regeliana could be allopolyploids that might have originated by hybridization between the diploids of E. regeliana and E. przewalskii (Fig. 6), although an origin by hybridization between an autotetraploid of E. regeliana and a tetraploid of other species cannot be ruled out. In addition, there could be incomplete linage sorting or introgression at the tetraploid level. However, it is unknown why this tetraploid population (XAB) only exhibits private chlorotypes. The diploids and tetraploids of E. gerardiana occur in clade C and clade B+ clade C, respectively (Fig. 5), and they do not share chlorotypes (Table 1; Fig. 1). This may also suggest an allopolyploid origin or a complicated origin of the tetraploid cytotype like in the tetraploid E. regeliana (Fig. 6), although the two cytotypes of E. gerardiana do not show clear morphological difference. To understand the origin of the tetraploids of this species, more samples need to be studied in the future.",

            "text": "Of the 36 Ephedra species that have been cytologically studied, 24 are polyploids or contain polyploid cytotypes (66% of species). Although intraspecific polyploidy has been documented in about half of the species, the results of some early cytological studies need to be checked carefully as mentioned earlier, and more population samples are necessary to study the ploidy levels of a species. Notably, all polyploids in the 24 species are tetraploids with the exception of an octoploid cytotype reported in E. funerea and E. gerardiana (Table S3, Supporting information). According to the available information (Table S3, Supporting information), tetraploids are present in about 75% of the Old World species and 62.5% of the New World species. Our present study found that all tetraploid Ephedra species from the QTP and neighbouring areas, excluding the species with both diploid and tetraploid populations, are allotetraploids. Therefore, we may conclude that allotetraploidy is a dominant mode of speciation in Ephedra, although the origin of other polyploids in this genus, especially from Europe and America, needs to be further studied. In fact, all of the remaining three polyploid species from other gymnosperm lineages were also deduced to be allopolyploids by Yang et al. (2012a, b).",

            "text": "The high percentage of polyploids in Ephedra could be related to some attributes of the genus such as a shrub habit, vegetative propagation, a relatively high rate of unreduced gamete formation, and a relatively low basic chromosome number and small genome size (at diploid level) for a gymnosperm (Leitch & Leitch 2012). Previous studies in angiosperms indicate that perennial herbaceous plants with clonality are more likely to form polyploids, which can persist for long periods of time until a suitable mate is found (Otto & Whitton 2000; Leitch & Bennett 2007; Otto 2007; Husband et al. 2013; Weiss\u2010Schneeweiss et al. 2013). Grif (2000) reported that plant taxa with a small DNA value per genome have a high percentage of polyploidy and show higher ploidy levels, and Wood et al. (2009) found that the generic base count (the minimum number of chromosomes reported in a genus) is negatively associated with polyploid incidence in angiosperms. In particular, the union of unreduced gametes has been considered as the most likely way of polyploid formation in plants (Harlan & de Wet 1975; de Wet 1980; Soltis et al. 2010; Brownfield & K\u00f6hler 2011), and the different rates of unreduced gamete formation could influence the establishment of polyploids in different lineages (Bretagnolle & Thompson 1996; Ramsey & Schemske 1998, 2002; Ramsey 2006; Younis et al. 2014). According to the karyomorphological study of Ephedra based on pollen germination, three of five tetraploid species exhibited unreduced pollen grains that accounted for 2\u20135% of the total amount (Mehra 1946). Also, dimorphism of pollen size in the same herbarium specimen has been reported from seven species of Ephedra, including E. alata, E. americana, E. aphylla, E. breana, E. chilensis, E. ochreata, E. torreyana, E. trifurca and E. tweediana (Beug 1956; Kedves 1987; Ickert\u2010Bond et al. 2003). Hence, a relatively high rate of unreduced gamete formation in Ephedra has very likely contributed to the high frequency of polyploids in the genus.",

Both these species widely occur in open areas such as zonal steppe, desert steppe or coarse\u2010textured\u2010skeletal\u2010sandy soils (Our unpublished observations; Freitag & Maier\u2010Stolte 1994; Fu et al. 1999). However, their putative progenitors E. equisetina, E. minuta and E. monosperma are usually subordinate components of acrophytia with narrow distributions in dry rocky slopes (Table S5; Fig. S2, Supporting information). It is particularly interesting that most of the allotetraploid taxa we found, including E. intermedia, E. likiangensis, E. saxatilis var. mairei and E. sinica, have adapted to a moister climate with a higher annual precipitation than their putative progenitors (Fig. S5L, P, T, V, Supporting information), considering that the genus Ephedra generally occurs in dry habitats.",
