'Science seeks certainty \u2026 and tells us what we can do\u2026 but it is for the law to tell [science] whether and how to do', 2 even if it is in a climate of uncertainties. As a natural phenomenon, scientists tend to concentrate on the beneficial uses of scientific research, but each of them should also concentrate on the potential destructive misuses, in as far as is known, assumed or reasonably predicted. Considering the fast accumulation of sophisticated scientific and biotechnological information, it is upon the scientist and his community to inform and warn the public about the potential destructive misuses of biotechnological research and findings. It is instrumental for the public to be aware of the risks posed by certain dangerous biological agents that are used, manipulated or developed in the course of biotechnological research. The public must be aware of and be reminded that certain biological agents can be used as biological lethal weapons for mass-destruction, or misused for deliberately inflicting infectious diseases. This can be done either by directly spreading common pathogens or by indirectly contaminating food-products, water resources, crops, animal food and feed, etc. It is known that certain lethal biological agents can be transformed into more lethal forms or may even be specifically engineered as such. It is upon the public at large, in applying its collective moral conscience, guided by relevant knowledge and information, to choose what scientific research and advanced technologies should be furthered, banned, or temporarily withheld.",

It is in the public interest to observe and protect these rights. However, in confronting today's threats and potential dangers, it is imperative to frame their protection within a legal framework, adequately balancing between 'fair and legitimate uses' and the potential 'destructive misuses'. Modern biotechnology has to strike the delicate balance between conflicting and competing interests, in order to protect the scientist in his working environment, and the public at large, in its extended environment. This has to be the 'oracle' and guiding code of all scientific research and its neighboring activities. Commercialization of biotechnological findings became an important vehicle in the knowledge-based global economy, but it is the law that makes them merchantable by securing their intellectual property rights. It is upon the law, and especially intellectual property law, to act as the 'Gatekeeper' of 'Morality and Public Order', and 'to tame the genie of science', although not too severely, for the present and future generations. There is a need for an interactive collaboration between the scientific community, the public at large, through its legislative bodies, the legal practitioners, the media and the judiciary in providing a balanced adequate normative infrastructure, designed for ensuring furtherance of scientific research and free dissemination of its results, subject to protection of public health, security and safety.",

Many new techniques and procedures are invented for manipulating and treating biological agents and a wide range of innovative equipment is available. Until not long ago the main concern, surrounding practice and research in biology, was focused on safety measures in the 'work place', mainly for the protection of researchers and 'workers', dealing in dangerous biological agents, especially in micro-biological laboratories. Microbiological laboratories have been considered as work places that pose infectious disease risks to persons that work in the laboratory or are in its vicinity. The history of microbiology describes laboratory-associated infections and cases of typhoid, cholera, brucellosis, and tetanus. A number of cases were attributed to carelessness or poor technique in the handling of infectious materials. 'Handling of cultures or specimens or the inhalation of dust containing dangerous organisms [was found] eminently dangerous to laboratory workers\u2026'; 7 'Exposure to infectious aerosols was considered as the most common source of infection.' 8 In the 1990s, a growing concern was expressed about the re-emergence of M tuberculosis. The 'routine application of recombinant DNA technologies has required a thorough risk assessment of their inherent unknowns. Nevertheless, it seemed that the scientific community assumed that in the course of scientific research, all manipulations with biological agents are legitimate for beneficial R&D. For years, a strong tendency has existed by the scientific community, to oppose intrusive regulation of their work. It was widely propagated and accepted that all scientific research has to rely on self-governance by the scientists depending on their integrity, morals and stringent ethical rules, rather than being incarcerated into legal normative frameworks, prescribed by the legislators.",

The recent events have tilted the balance, justifying rethinking of existing policies and change of approach. It became clear that biotechnology in its manifold 'get-ups' and 'dualuse' processes and products, alongside its legitimate uses, poses a 'clear and present danger' if used for destructive purposes. The world community has been reminded that certain biological agents, e.g., toxins, viruses and bacteria, innocently dealt with or invented and developed for scientific research or medicine have been and can be used as biological weapons for mass-destruction. This depends on the nature of the biological agent. its preparation; its ability for 'survival' in the environment; its dispersion ability; scope of contamination, etc. Scientific writings underlined the difficulty in detectability and the delayed ouevert effect of a released biological agent. Voices stressed the simplicity of access to dangerous biological agents, easy development and simple employment for bioterrorism in whatever destructive manner, 'not entailing excessive costs'! Pathogens can be obtained from\u2026[their] natural environment, \u2026 [from] a microbiology laboratory or bank \u2026 An alternative to acquiring agents is creating them \u2026 Advances in biotechnology have made it possible to synthesize certain viruses based on their genome, or on genetic instructions \u2026 or to modify agents and alter their function. 10 It was stressed that agents modified for increased pathogenecity and a shorter incubation period could cause severe, fast-acting diseases. Other modifications could make treatments, vaccines, or the body's immune system, useless. 11 Attention was drawn to possible dangers if deadly microorganisms may unintentionally, through negligence or carelessness, 'escape' from a laboratory or while in transit. It was also stressed that in course of dealing with such agents, a scientist may not knowingly become infected by a life-threatening disease and become a carrier of it into his community or even further. In cases of recklessness or negligence, he may enable access to such agents for hostile purposes.",

It is recognized that the dual-use characteristics of biotechnology and its products pose a difficult dilemma for the scientific and legal communities and for the public at large. However, while science races ahead in an unprecedented pace, law limps heavily in its far back and the public remains dormant until some disaster scares it. Considering the new developments and the presently known dual-uses of biotechnology, it may be said that there is already a public consensus that biotechnological research in dealing with dangerous biological agents requires a strict and comprehensive normative framework. Although the Geneva Protocol prohibits use of chemical and biological weapons in warfare and the BWC restricts countries from developing, producing, stockpiling, or acquiring biological agents, weapons, and equipment outside of peaceful purposes, these international legal instruments are not equally implemented. Many of the signatory nations, in adhering to the convention, have prohibited further development of biological weapons and destroyed their existing arsenals, but it is known, that some of the adhering parties have secretly continued and some non-parties are even hurriedly competing in developing new sophisticated biological weapons.",

Invention, development and maintaining of medical countermeasures, is to be strongly encouraged. 31 'Security should be provided for R&D of countermeasures, and for evaluation and production of new and emerging technologies against Bioterrorist attacks and other public health emergencies\u2026.' 32 'Stockpiles of drugs, vaccines and other biological products, medical devices, and other supplies\u2026 appropriate and practicable [for health security]\u2026 in the event of a bioterrorist attack' should be maintained. 33 In its wide spectrum of prescribed 'Enhanced Regulatory Control of Certain Biological Agents and Toxins', the Act stresses the necessity and importance of maintaining, by regulations, the 'list of each biological agent and each toxin that has the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety'. 34 It also repeats the same criteria as prescribed by the AEDPA 1996, with slight changes in the consultation process.

If such release poses a threat to public health or safety, the Secretary shall immediately notify the relevant authorities (local, State or Federal) and the public. Compliance with these requirements shall be ensured by the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, as part of the registration system.' 40 Requirements and limitations for access to listed agents should be imposed by regulations in accordance with stringent stipulations by law. 41 Upon receiving the names and other identifying information the Attorney General shall, identify 'whether the individuals involved are within any of the [suspected by the act] categories', and shall 'promptly use criminal immigration, national security, and other electronic databases that are available to the Federal Government and are appropriate for such purpose'. 42 Exemptions are prescribed for clinical or diagnostic laboratories by providing that:",

This alone is not enough. Judged by the surveyed provisions it shall be said that there is enough legal authority for regulating research in the field of new biotechnology at its source. It may also be said that in many communities there already exists a regulatory framework, providing adequate precautionary bio-safety and bio-security measures for preventing or minimizing recklessness and possible destructive uses of dangerous biological agents. However, as already said, the unprecedented race and advances in biological, biomedical research and technological development, in comparison with the conventional slow pace of the legislative process, make it impossible for the authorized bodies to embrace all the advances, even if speeded up in consequence of recent events. The same is to be said as to updating regulatory implementation regimes and enforcement mechanisms. Thus, it is important to emphasize that awareness and alertness of each individual scientist in dealing with dangerous biological agents and the willingness of the entire scientific community for recognizing the seriousness and feasibility of the possible misuse of biological agents and toxins -is very instrumental.

The public was informed that they succeeded 'to build from scratch an entire microbial chromosome, a loop of synthetic DNA, carrying all the instructions that a simple cell needs to live and reproduce'. 66 Craig Venter was quoted saying that 'the goal is to design novel microbes whose handcrafted genomes endow them with the ability to produce useful chemicals, including renewable synthetic fuels that could substitute for oil'!

The New York Times Co., 70 Hatfill, who was considered an experts in the area of biological weapons and agents by government officials and the scientific community alike, propagated increased government vigilance to combat bioterrorism and in 1999 co-authored an article which 'urged the public health community to step up efforts to be prepared for a chemical or biological attack.' 73 In determining the plaintiff's status, based on the mentioned facts, whether he was a private or a public figure or a public official, the court concluded that he qualifies as a 'public official', notwithstanding the plaintiff's claim that he was a private person, 'involuntary dragged into the controversial situation'. 74 The court stressed the fact that the public had an interest in the plaintiff, considering his qualifications, the highly sensitive nature of his work and its importance to national defense. In describing him as 'a vocal critic of the government's level of preparedness for a bioterrorist attack' and in reference to his lectures, writings, participation on panels, and interviews, as well as his own resume as an expert in the field of biological weaponry, the court concluded: 'The Plaintiff voluntarily assumed a role of special prominence in the public debate over the nation's preparedness for a biological attack, and indeed sought to influence government policy. The plaintiff should have foreseen that by his activities he 'was likely to invite [public] attention and scrutiny'. 75 Moreover, the relevant questions are: Did his warning really draw attention of the public? Did anybody draw consequences from their contents? Assuming that it was a warning by a recognized expert expressed in classified circles but also on public media, did the decision makers act upon it, and did it raise public concern?",

It was stressed that the army was instructed to 'carefully select crop destruction tar-gets\u2026 in areas remote from population\u2026 [and] only of military significance'. The US government claimed that the 1925 Geneva Protocol does not ban the use of some herbicides in warfare, since 'chemical herbicides which were unknown in 1925, could not be included within the scope of the prohibitions'. In reviewing the justicibility of the herbicide program the judges emphasized that the operations became a matter of scientific controversy almost from their inception, but the herbicide program was continued because of 'substantial military benefit'. Court stressed that in April 1970 some components of the herbicide were banned from most U.S domestic uses on the basis of evidence of its 'possible teratogenicity'. On April 15, 1970, DOD suspended military use of Agent Orange upon evidence of toxicity of the dioxin component. In January 1971, the last spray mission took place.",

The court stressed that: '[t]he concept of military necessity or proportionality is a well accepted international norm governing the conduct of war. There is nothing in the UN Charter outlawing the use of herbicides in Viet-nam\u2026.' 78 The court observed: 'Norms that depend on modifiers such as disproportionate or unnecessary, invite case-by-case balancing of competing interests and black-letter rules become vague and easily manipulated.' 79 One wonders whether 'Agent Orange' operation would go on if the US government would have timely applied the 'precautionary principle' while the climate was of uncertainty which unfortunately became later, a certainty!.

Thus, it is important to observe that many of the clauses speak in a very amorphous language, subjecting it to judicial interpretation of conduct or terms that partly have never been defined.
