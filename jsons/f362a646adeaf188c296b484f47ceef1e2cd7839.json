Earlier intensive surveillance or treatment then could be performed to saves lives. Previous reports had descried the clinical characters of the patients with COVID-19. The difference between the mild and severe subjects were compared. [2] [3] [4] Nonetheless, previous studies have limitations including the relatively small sample sizes, single center observations and using the univariate analysis along. The independent predicted factors of fatal outcome remain uncertain. What more, it has been suggested that the use of a single risk factor could hardly estimate the comprehensive clinical outcome of individual patients. 5 Therefore, based on a national cohort, our study attempts to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatality through multivariate Cox regression analysis and nomogram model .",

Though the CFR is obviously lower than SARS(10%) 9 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome MERS(36%), 10 the transmissibility of COVID seem to be much higher. Recent study has found the 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) is approximately 10-to 20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binding to functional host-cell receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), which may be a potential mechanism for the large number of infected population around world. 11 Consistent with previous reports 12, 13 , our study indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to all aged groups. However, the elderly patients are more severe and generally have a higher probability of the fatal outcome.

Some independent laboratory predictors of the fatal outcome were found via multivariate Cox regression analysis. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a calcitonin pro-peptide synthesized by C cells of the thyroid gland and released from leukocytes, which is significantly increased in bacterial infections and the SEPSIS. It has been proved a high specificity for bacterial infection and an good correlation with severity of illness. 24 Procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic stewardship (ABS) has been shown to reduce antibiotics, with lower side-effects and an improvement in clinical outcomes. 25 In the nomogram model of our study , an elevated level of PCT (>0.5ng/ml) was a strong reliable predictor for case fatality. The results indicated that secondary bacterial infections on the earlier stage may play an important role in progressive of the disease .",

Increased creatinine (\u2265133 \u03bcmol/liter) and total bilirubin(>17.1 \u03bcmol/liter) might associated with the death outcome. Since ACE2 is widely expressed in multiple organs besides lung , it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 could invade the local tissues and lead to a direct damage and indirect damage. The following activation of immune response and cytokines storm will also play an important role in the organ dysfunction. Over activation of peripheral T cells, present as increase of CC4+CCR6+Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells\uff0cmay contribute to the immune injury in severe case with COVID-19. 21 What's more, the usage of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antivirus, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine which might associated with liver and renal injury. These findings call for multidisciplinary cooperation and monitoring of the organ dysfunction.",

First, in some cases, there were incomplete documentation of the history, symptoms or laboratory findings in the electronic database, even after trying effort to feedback and recollect. Some diagnosis of co-existing illness were from patients' self-reports at admission, which might lead to the recalling bias. Although the cohort had a broad coverage of all patients and regions, the non-responsive bias cannot be fully excluded. Second, as a retrospective and observational study, we currently could not set up a validation cohort to assess the predictive accuracy due to the urgent timeline under this special situation. However, we use the bootstrap resampling cohort and show that the C-index is ideal, suggesting the nomogram is a good model for predicting outcomes. Likewise, the calibration curves for survival probability also demonstrated a good consistence between the prediction and the observation.",

The median age of fatal cases who received NIV and IMV were 69 years (range: 53-84 years), 66 years (range: 51-82 years), respectively. 10.8% of cases were given ECMO,21.1% with CRRT therapy. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, secondary infection, septic shock were the common reported complications (Figure 1B&C).FigureE1 in appendix showed a progression of a 63-year-old patient with a fatal outcome.

Kaplan-Meier survival plots for these prognostic factors are shown in Figure 3. The nomogram was constructed based on the final multi-variate model. To calculate 14 days, 21 days and 28 days overall survival probability, we first identify each factor based on the points scale at the top of the nomogram and then sum the points of each factor. Finally, the 14 days, 21 days and 28 days overall survival probability was obtained based on the bottom point scale of the nomogram (Figure 4). The calibration plots on bootstrap resampling validation are illustrated in Figure 5.
