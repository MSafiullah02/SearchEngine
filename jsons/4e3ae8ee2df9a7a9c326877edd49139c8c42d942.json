Since SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted via respiratory droplets and close contact [10], more evidence emerged to show positive PCR detection of the virus in various clinical specimens, such as blood, sputum, feces, urine, and nasal samples [11, 12] . The live virus has even been detected in feces [12] , implying the possibility of fecal-oral spread. In recent studies the basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated as 2.20~3.77, higher than those of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [3, 5] . Due to the large number of cases of infection in Hubei Province, the details of the cases were not released, so we collected information on cases confirmed to be from outside of Hubei Province. In this study, our objectives were to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases and the length of the interval between contact with infected patients to the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis.",

The average age for all cases was 44.24 years, with a range from two months to 97 years old.

By comparing with the age-specific proportion of the national population, we found the proportion of cases under 20 years old (20,826 per 10 6 ) is much lower than that of other age groups (56,189 per 10 6 ). Up to 61.50% (3,802) of all cases were imported cases and 37.56% (1,428) of them came directly from Wuhan ( Table 2 ).

Fatigue (9.96%) and pharyngalgia (6.68%) were common as well. A few cases also reported digestive tract symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. Compared with 533 cured cases, 21 deaths occurred among patients who were much older (71.9 vs 39.9 years old), and a much higher proportion of these deaths occurred among patients with other diseases (71.4% vs 0.9%).",
