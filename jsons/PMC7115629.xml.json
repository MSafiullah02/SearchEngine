The S-protein is a 150\u2013180 kDa highly glycosylated trimeric class-I fusion protein [4], [5] responsible for receptor binding, virus-membrane fusion and tissue tropism. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for virus entry into susceptible target cells [6], [7], but C-type lectin L-SIGN (CD209L) has also been shown to mediate virus uptake [8]. S-mediated viral entry occurs in a pH-dependent manner [9], [10] and can be inhibited by S-specific sera [11]. Neutralizing antibodies are broadly elicited in patients with SARS [12] and passive transfer of S-specific antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S [13], to na\u00efve animals confer protection to SARS-CoV challenge indicating that the humoral immune response alone can protect against SARS-CoV [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].",

            "text": "SARS vaccine candidates should induce strong protective immunity against infection and person-to-person transmission which requires a humoral immune response at both systemic and mucosal levels and absence of immunopathology. Different vaccine candidates have been explored for SARS including DNA [19], Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) [16] subunit vaccine [20] or inactivated virus vaccine [21], [22], [23] and they all have been shown to induce neutralizing and protective responses. While protection was achieved in the mouse with a recombinant MVA virus expressing S protein [16], vaccination with a different MVA-S construct failed to elicit a sustained serum neutralizing antibody titer to SARS-CoV in ferrets and subsequent challenge with SARS-CoV was associated with hepatitis [24]. In vitro data also demonstrate that anti-S immune responses can enhance SARS-CoV entry into target cells. Yang and colleagues showed that entry of SARS-CoV pseudotype viruses, expressing the palm civet S-protein, into a human renal epithelial cell-line was enhanced by human S-specific neutralizing antibodies [25]. Such in vitro detectable facilitating antibodies can be correlated with disease enhancement in feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected cats (FIPV) and it has been shown that vaccine-induced anti-S antibodies and macrophage-expressed Fc receptors (FcR) are key factors of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [26], [27] in cats.",

The hamster is an interesting small animal model as it reproduces several pathological features of human SARS including high titer replication of SARS-CoV in lungs and nasal turbinates and marked lung pathology including cellular necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltrates [30]. In the present study, we analyzed the immune response to a recombinant native full-length S protein trimer of SARS-CoV. Neutralizing and enhancing activity could be detected in sera of immunized animals and human convalescent SARS patient sera in vitro while challenge experiments in hamsters indicate complete protection and absence of disease enhancement in vivo.",

Analysis of the apparent molecular weight of the protein by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot under non-reducing conditions revealed the predominant trimeric nature of the antigen (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Trimers dissociate into monomers when the protein is heat-denatured in the presence of SDS indicating that monomers are associated non-covalently (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Higher molecular weight DTT-sensitive aggregates were observed when the protein was not heat denatured prior to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, lane 3). As expected, trimers and aggregates dissociate completely into monomers when heat-denatured in SDS and DTT (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Monomers derived from SDS/heat-denatured trimers have a slightly greater electrophoretic mobility than monomers derived from SDS/heat/DTT denatured trimers indicating that intramolecular disulfide bonds lead to a more compact three dimensional conformation of the Spike monomer. The trimeric and monomeric S-protein frequently migrate as doublets (Fig. 1B) [33]. These represent high-mannose glycoforms from proteins that reside in the ER at the time of lysis and glycoforms from proteins that have acquired complex N-glycans in the median-Golgi [33]. triSpike has native antigenicity shown by reactivity with sera from 10 convalescent SARS patients by Western Blot and FACS (data not shown). The native fold was further underscored by the specific binding of the triSpike protein with soluble ACE2 receptor (Fig. 2E, lane 2). Altogether our results strongly argue that purified triSpike molecules mimic the native trimeric S-protein on the virion surface.",

Previous study suggested the induction of IgG response in serum (systemic response) and IgA response in stool (mucosal response) samples against Yersinia pestis using intraperitoneal immunization [39]. To address this question antibody were prepared from fecal samples of immunized animals. Occult blood detection showed absence of blood contamination (data not shown) indicating that the samples were not contaminated by serum antibodies. Western Blot using antibodies isolated from fecal samples revealed that mucosal IgG and IgA were induced by triSpike plus alum but not by triSpike alone (Fig. 3A).

SARS pseudotype particles (SARS-CoVpp) were generated for this study. These recombinant viruses encoding the luciferase reporter gene and expressing the SARS-CoV Spike protein at the virion surface have been shown to faithfully mimic the SARS-CoV entry process [9], [10], [11]. We infected cells with SARS-CoVpp in the presence or absence of heat-inactivated serum from triSpike immunized mice and hamsters as well as sera from ten convalescent SARS patients. Transduction of FcR-negative VeroE6 cells with SARS-CoVpp was reduced in a dose-dependent manner when pseudovirus was pre-incubated with S-specific antisera (Fig. 4B & C). When SARS-CoVpp were pre-incubated with heat-inactivated S-specific mouse or hamster sera a dose-dependent enhancement of ACE2-negative Raji B and Daudi cell transduction was observed (Fig. 4A\u2013C). Only background level of transduction was detected in the absence of serum or in the presence of sera from the na\u00efve control group. When Raji B cells were pre-incubated with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) SARS-CoVpp transduction was reduced to background levels demonstrating that pseudovirus entry was Fc\u03b3RII dependent (Fig. 4D). Furthermore ADE could be abrogated by pre-incubating the pseudovirus-antibody mix with protein G, demonstrating that the process is mediated by the Fc portion of the antibody (data not shown). Interestingly, a mAb against ACE2 blocked transduction of VeroE6 cells by SARS-CoVpp but not on Raji B cells by SARS-CoVpp-antibody complexes indicating that Fc\u03b3RII mediated virus entry does not require ACE2 for virus-cell membrane fusion (Fig. 4D). Only a low level of SARS-CoVpp transduction was observed with the J774A1 murine macrophage cell line despite the presence of Fc\u03b3RII receptor. ADE was not limited to vaccine-induced anti-S sera from mice and hamsters. Eight out of ten sera from convalescent SARS patients also showed enhancement of Raji B cell transduction despite the capacity of 10/10 sera to neutralize virus entry into VeroE6 cells (data not shown). Our results demonstrate that S-specific antibodies can induce a shift in cell tropism of SARS-CoV towards human Fc\u03b3RII expressing cells. Antibody- and Fc\u03b3RII-dependent but ACE2-independent virus entry and fusion is a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV can enter into target cells.",

Half the hamsters receiving three doses of 2 \u03bcg triSpike vaccine showed complete protection from challenge. Mean viral titers for the group were 102.3 TCID50/g tissue. Seventy-five percent of hamsters receiving three doses of 10 \u03bcg triSpike vaccine showed complete protection from challenge. One hamster for this group had viral titers just above the limit of detection at 102 TCIDso/g tissue. In comparison of four mock immunized hamsters had similar high titers of SARS-CoV present with a mean viral titer of 107.2 TCIDso/g tissue. Patterns or consistent elevations of liver enzymes were not observed in any group following any immunization or SARS-CoV challenge (data not shown).",

The data indicate that regardless of the dose administered the vaccine significantly protects from the occurrence and severity of pneumonitis following SARS-CoV challenge. In contrast to previously published data where pneumonitis and consolidation were completely cleared by day 14 post-challenge, moderate (1/4) to severe pneumonitis (3/4) was observed 21 days post-challenge in mock immunized hamsters. In triSpike immunized hamsters 21 days post-challenge, pneumonitis was completely cleared (3/13) or reduced to mild (8/12) or moderate (2/12) levels. The variation between these observations and previously reported observations in the time to resolution of pneumonitis is likely due to changes in tissue processing. Lungs were inflated with formalin in these studies and were not in the previous report [30]. Nevertheless, consistent with previously reported data, 21 days after challenge pulmonary consolidation was absent in all groups including the mock immunized controls.",

            "text": "There is currently no licensed vaccine against a human coronavirus. Vaccines against animal coronaviruses have been successfully generated, e.g. transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [40]. However, the development of a vaccine against FIPV has proven difficult due to immune enhancement of disease in vaccinated cats. Receptors binding viral envelope glycoproteins are prime targets for neutralizing antibodies [41]. We hypothesized that a SARS-CoV envelope with native trimeric conformation would be optimal for induction of conformation-dependent neutralizing antibodies targeting multiple epitopes. Full-length coronavirus Spike glycoproteins with an intact transmembrane domain were previously shown to assemble into rosettes generating highly immunogenic enveloped lipid spheres [42]. Biochemical characterization of the S-protein immunogen showed that purified recombinant S protein migrates in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight >500 kDa, suggesting that it is a trimer. The correctly folded S protein is a complex-glycosylated, non-covalently linked homotrimeric glycoprotein which is not cleaved by intracellular proteases during exit to the cell surface. These results are in agreement with data obtained by others for SARS [5] and other coronaviruses [4]. Immunopurified preparations of full-length S trimer (triSpike) contain correctly folded S protein but also mannosylated high molecular weight forms, which are likely ER retained proteins that are not yet correctly folded or being degraded. Indeed, high-mannose forms are purged from the ER, as evidenced by pulse-chase experiments [33] and by treatment of S expressing cells with translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Correct folding and native conformation of triSpike was confirmed by binding to soluble ACE2 receptor. Preliminary results obtained with two soluble forms of the S-protein ectodomain, Secd (aa1-1184) and S1 (aa1-757), show that Secd migrates with the apparent molecular weight of a trimer (>500 kDa), consistent with the model that trimerization domains are located within the membrane proximal S2 domain, while S1 migrates with the apparent molecular weight of a monomer (data not shown). These findings are in agreement with previous reports showing that coronavirus MHV and TGEV S proteins are trimers [4], [43].",

In our experiment sera collected from Secd and S1 immunized animals also neutralized SARS-CoV (unpublished data) suggesting that the key neutralization epitopes are located in the S1 domain and that correct conformation of the monomer alone is sufficient to achieve a neutralizing response. Our data show that a purified protein vaccine can induce such blocking antibodies with high efficiency. Indeed neutralizing sera from our vaccinated mice prevented triSpike binding to soluble human ACE2 receptor indicating that the RBD is accessible to antibodies and suggesting receptor binding inhibition as key mechanism of virus neutralization in triSpike immunized animals. However, blocking of receptor binding might not be the sole mechanism of virus neutralization. Neutralization with antibodies against the putative S2 protein [51] suggest that antibodies can also block post binding steps, e.g. conformational transitions of the S2 subunit required for membrane fusion.",

ADE occurs when a virus-antibody complex interacts with FcR or complement to trigger virus uptake or alternatively when antibodies induce conformational changes in envelope glycoproteins that are required for virus-cell membrane fusion [56]. Antibody-dependent conformational changes have previously been reported for a civet cat strain of SARS-CoV which showed enhanced entry into a human renal epithelial cell-line in the presence of human monoclonal antibodies against human strain of SARS-CoV Spike [25]. We could exclude this mechanism of enhancement as sera from triSpike vaccinated mice did neutralize, rather than enhance, virus infection on VeroE6 cells. However, we observed that sera from triSpike vaccinated mice or hamsters showed a 100\u20131000 fold increase in virus entry into Fc\u03b3RII positive, ACE2-negative human B cells. ADE was still observed when the complement was inactivated by heat treatment of sera but could be abrogated by protein G and an anti-Fc\u03b3RII antibody, demonstrating that ADE is mediated by the Fc region of the antibody and the Fc\u03b3RII receptor. Interestingly, the R/R131 genotype of the human Fc\u03b3RIIA receptor was recently correlated with severity of disease in SARS patients [57]. Our results show that anti-ACE2 antibody did not reduce transduction by pseudovirus-antibody complexes indicating that Spike-mediated virus cell entry and membrane fusion can occur through an ACE2-independent mechanism. Together with previously described data, our results suggest that pseudovirus-antibody complexes might be endocytosed via Fc\u03b3RII, followed by protease cleavage of S in the endosome [58], [59] and S2-mediated membrane fusion in a low pH endosomal compartment [9], [60].",

Analysis of monoclonal antibodies against S should provide evidence whether antibody subclass or specific epitopes are involved in the enhancement mechanism. Interestingly, we observed the enhancement phenotype only in human B cell lines but not in mouse macrophages despite the presence of Fc\u03b3RII. Reasons for this are unclear, but the respective role of activating and inhibiting human Fc\u03b3RII which have identical extracellular but heterologous intracellular domains and signaling capacities might play a role [63]. ADE in SARS-CoV entry is not restricted to vaccine-induced anti-S antibodies but can also be observed with SARS patient sera. Eight out of ten sera capable of neutralizing infection on VeroE6 cells were found to enhance transduction of B cell lines. B cells have been shown to be only occasionally infected in patients with SARS [64]. However, enhanced viral entry into B cells could have a profound effect on pathogenesis even if ensuing viral replication in this cell type is abortive. Vaccine-induced antibodies that enhance entry of virus could increase the frequency of B cell infection in vaccinated subjects and alter disease on subsequent exposure to SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Vaccine-mediated protection against SARS-CoV infection in mice has been demonstrated using different vaccine approaches [19], [20], [65]. However, mice do not replicate SARS-CoV to high titers and do not show pronounced pathology in lungs [15]. On the contrary, ferrets [28], cynomolgus macaques [29] and hamsters [30] have been shown to support high titer replication of SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract associated with pneumonitis. In order to assess the respective role of neutralization or ADE in vivo we performed SARS-CoV challenge experiments in hamsters vaccinated with three doses of 2, 10 or 50 \u03bcg of protein in alum adjuvant. All vaccinated groups showed a significant decrease of viral load at 3 days post challenge by at least four orders of magnitude without signs of enhanced lung pathology. The rare foci of hepatocyte necrosis that we observed in these hamsters did not correlate with pre-challenge neutralizing antibody titers, liver enzyme levels (pre- or post-challenge), or immunohistochemical detection of SARS-CoV antigen suggesting that hepatic cellular necrosis is unrelated to SARS-CoV immunization or infection in Syrian golden hamsters. This contrasts with a report of hepatitis 28 days following challenge with SARS-CoV in ferrets vaccinated with a poorly immunogenic recombinant MVA vaccine expressing SARS-CoV spike protein [24].",
