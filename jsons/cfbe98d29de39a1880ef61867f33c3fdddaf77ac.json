As of now, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs declared to be officially useful against the infection. Saikosaponin is a group of oleanane derivatives reported in Chinese medicinal plants and are described for their anti-viral, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antinephritis and hepatoprotective activities. They have also been known to have anti-coronaviral property by interfering the early stage of viral replication including absorption and penetration of the virus. Thus, the present study was undertaken to screen and evaluate the potency of different Saikosaponins against different sets of SARS-CoV-2 binding protein via computational molecular docking simulations. Docking was carried out on a Glide module of Schrodinger Maestro 2018-1 MM Share Version on NSP15 (PDB ID: 6W01) and Prefusion 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VSB) from SARS-CoV-2. From the binding energy and interaction studies, the Saikosaponins U and V showed the best affinity towards both the proteins suggesting them to be future research molecule as they mark the desire interaction with NSP15, which is responsible for replication of RNA and also with 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein which manage the connection with ACE2.",

The genome sequencing has revealed novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, formally known as 2019-nCoV as etiological agent for COVID-19 . The genome of CoVs (enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA) is the largest genome of known RNA viruses with varying size (26 kb-32kb in length). Coronaviridae family can be divided in four genera comprising of aand b-CoV, known to infect mammals, whereas dand c-CoVs infect birds. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus i.e. SARS (2002) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus i.e. MERS (2012) were viral pneumonia outbreaks due to b-CoVs and resulted in approximately 800 deaths (Song et al., 2019; Abdo & Eman, 2020) . Whereas, this 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC) declared due to widespread outbreak of a SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 1,773,086 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 111,652 deaths, as of 05:00 pm CEST, 13 April 2020, reported to World Health Organization (WHO) (https://who. sprinklr.com) (World Health Organization. 2020).",

The recent report on the threedimensional structure of the crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV main protease (PDB: 6LU7) revealed, that the protein is encoded within the viral genome , in complex with an inhibitor.

Indeed, in current emmergent situation, the concept of drug repositioning might be a cost-effective and time-efficient option for meticulous development of possible therapeutic and/or prophylatic lead condidate(s) from wellknown traditional and/or approved drugs (Li et al., 2019) . Recent studies comprising reverse vaccinology and via integrated computational approaches have highlighted repurposing of FDA approved drugs and known drugs from various databases against various corona virus enzymes either individually or in combination to combat the virulence in COVID 19 (Muralidharan et al., 2020; Elmezayen et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020; Pant et al., 2020; Enayatkhani et al. 2020; . The interaction of ACE-2 and with spike protein with furin cleavage site resulting in the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 is also reported (Hasan et al. 2020) . Additionally, several phytochemicals were found effective in inhibiting the 3CL pro of SARS-CoV and blocking the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells viz. phenolic compounds of Isatis indigotica root (Lin et al., 2005) , baicalin (Chen et al., 2004) , glycyrrhizin (Cinatl et al., 2003) , quercetin (Chen et al., 2006) and Saikosaponin (Cheng et al., 2006) . Moreover, 'leads' from natural products has also been explored for their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (Aanouz et al., 2020) , and hesperetin, a natural citrus fruit flavonoid is found promising in suppressing the cleavage activity of the 3 C-like protease (3CL pro ) of SARS-CoV in cell-free and cell-based assays .",

            "text": "Saikosaponins represent a group of oleanane derivatives, usually glucosides and are major bioactive compounds found in plants of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) such as Bupleurum spp., Heteromorpha spp. and Scrophularia scorodonia (Li et al. 2018a; Li et al., 2018b) . Saikosaponins have been reported for various biological activities like anti-viral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antinephritis and hepatoprotective activity both in-vivo and in-vitro (Chen et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2018) . Saikosaponins exhibit immunomodulatory effects with enhanced production of immunosuppressive mediators i.e. T helper (Th) 1/Th2 cells, IL-4 and IL-10 and suppression of pro-immune mediators (IFN-c and TNF-a in splenocytes) (Huang et al., 2017) . Inhibitory potential of Saikosaponins for HBV-DNA replication and HBsAg secretion, without inhibition of cell proliferation has been found to be superior to lamivudine (well-known antiviral drug) (Lin et al., 2015) . Moreover, Saikosaponins (A, B 2 , C and D) have also been reported for their anti-coronaviral efficacy by interfering the early stage of viral replication including absorption and penetration of the virus (Cheng et al., 2006) . A recent study, performed by Goswami and Bagehi (2020) reported the potential of Saikosaponins against SARS-CoV-2, showing favorable affinity towards RBD region of the spike glycoprotein using docking simulation study (Goswami & Bagchi 2020) . However, it will be interesting to investigate the potency of different class of Saikosaponins towards the other protein such as NSP15 and fusion spike (S1 and S2) protein, which will give a clear indication about the selectivity of the Saikosaponins towards SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, in the current investigation attempt has been made to screen and evaluate the potency of different Saikosaponins against different sets of SARS-CoV-2 binding protein via computational molecular docking simulations.",

This S protein occurs in a metastable prefusion conformation which undergoes structural rearrangement so that the viral membrane gets fuses with the host cell membrane (Li, 2016; Bosch et al., 2003) . This fusion process is accelerated by binding of S1 subunit to the host-cell receptor and by transition of the S2 subunit to a highly stable postfusion conformation (Walls et al., 2017) . The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 subunit undergoes hinge-like conformational movement to engage the host-cell receptor, which transiently hide/expose the determinants of receptor binding. Further, the S1/S2 subunits have been reported to possess arginine-arginine-alanine-arginine (RRAR) a protease cleavage site. Recent studies have also reported that, 2019-nCoV S and SARS-CoV S shares the same functional host cell receptor i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In addition, the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 106 fragment (S residues from 319-591) have reported to have ACE2 binding site. The affinity with which ACE2 bounds to 2019-nCoV S ectodomain is 10-to 20-fold higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S. Due to the higher binding affinity of 2019-nCoV S for human ACE2, the spread of 2019-nCoV became apparently much prevalent from human-to-human (Chan et al., 2020) .",
