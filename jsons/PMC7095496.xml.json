The percentage of mechanically ventilated infants and children varies from 30 to 64% [1, 2, 3, 4]. Since its introduction into the modern ICUs, MV has undergone continuous evolution. There has been an explosion of new ventilator modes, many of which have been incorporated into routine clinical practice without evidence of their efficacy o their superiority over other modes of ventilation. Indeed, in most cases physicians must rely only on short studies performed on small numbers of patients to help them decide which mode of ventilatory support they should use for their patients with acute respiratory failure.",

We found that the percentage of mechanically ventilated children compares more closely with this later study. The wide variation in the percentage of ventilated patients could be related to several factors such as regionalization of PICUs, political admission and discharges of PICUs, severity of illness, and seasonal variation. The time period of this study missed respiratory syncytial virus season for most of the participating PICUs; hence, the percentage of patients receiving MV would have been higher.",

Among the subgroups of ARF, the higher proportions were the acute pulmonary disease and postoperative state. Acute pulmonary disease was seen to be the main reason for the initiation of MV in developing countries [13, 14], whereas postoperative state seems to be the main indication for institute ventilatory support in developed countries [15]. To date, there has been significant progress in our understanding of pathophysiology in patients with ARDS, and innovative therapies for ARDS in children are available. Accordingly, several attempts have been made to obtain precise information on the incidence of ARDS. In both, adult and children ventilated patients, the reported incidence of ARDS ranged from 2 to 4% [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Now, we have found that ARDS accounted for only 2% of patients who required MV at admission to the PICUs.",

Different reasons may be attributed for the lack of uniformity in the selection of ventilatory modes in the pediatric population. One reason is the lack of published studies assessing the most beneficial ventilatory mode in terms of mortality or in reducing the time that patient remains on ventilatory support",

For example, this method was not reported in Harel et al.\u2019s [5] study, but we found that 30% of mechanically ventilated patients used this method to gain liberation from MV. The SBT has been shown to be a useful approach in identifying those patients who are ready for extubation [13, 14, 25]. Although, its implementation in infants and children mechanically ventilated could simplify the approach to weaning and shorten the duration of MV, it is an aspect that requires further investigation.",

Nevertheless, the selection of ventilatory settings in our patients with ARDS reflects a more cautious use by PICU physicians than in the beginning of the past decade. Before the recommendation of American College of Chest Physicians [6], three studies reported a maximum level of PIP utilization ranging from 63\u00b117 to 73\u00b118 cm H2O [18, 19, 20]. We have found that the median peak inspiratory pressure used on these patients with ARDS from days 1\u20136 was never higher than 37 cm of water. Similarly, the set tidal volume values that we found in those patients with ARDS between days 1 and 6 of MV ranged between 13 and 10 ml/kg, respectively. These tidal volume values are also remarkably lower than previously reported by a study in the beginning of 1990 [20].",

Furthermore, the reintubation rate after unplanned endotracheal extubation and later re-institution of MV was 30%. These data suggest that many infants and children are kept intubated longer than necessary. More frequent assessment for the eligibility to wean and a protocol-driven weaning from MV should help to identify those patients who remain unnecessarily on the ventilator. Likewise, a re-intubation rate of 10\u201320% or so is consistently found among pediatric studies [13, 14, 15, 24, 25, 31] and is confirmed in the present study. Like us, several studies on pediatric and adult populations have reported that patients requiring reintubation have a significantly higher mortality than patients who are successfully extubated [13, 30, 32, 33]; however, in this study the mortality rate of reintubated patients was not different for the entire group who received MV. Again, it is possible for reintubated patients to begin a new course of MV where the probability of mortality is very similar to that of those patients who received MV for more than 12 h [17].",

These descriptive studies performed in unselected and heterogeneous population have showed that the mortality rate ranges from 50 to 75%. The mortality rate in this study in infants and children with ARDS was approximately 50%. The mortality rates in adult and pediatric patients in the controlled clinical studies on ARDS and acute lung injury ranged from 30 to 40% [35, 36]. The higher mortality in observational studies as compared with clinical trials might be explained, at least in part, by restrictive inclusion criteria for the enrollment of patients with poor prognosis in the controlled clinical trials [17, 37].",
