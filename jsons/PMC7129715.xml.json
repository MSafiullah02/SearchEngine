IL-6 is also a pyrogenic cytokine and, and a trial involving 21 patients in China [6] found that tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor antagonist) quickly resolved some of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, such as fever and oxygen saturation. Sarilumab an inhibitor of soluble and membrane IL-6R\u03b1 receptors may reduce the severity of the pulmonary complications of COVID-19, including respiratory failure, but there is no evidence that it has anti-viral potential.",
