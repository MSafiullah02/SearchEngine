Ganciclovir (GCV) and foscarnet are effective agents in the prevention and treatment of CMV disease.5,6 However, these antiviral agents are not without disadvantages: ganciclovir causes neutropenia and an increased risk of bacterial and fungal infection;7,8,9,10,11,12 resistance to antiviral drugs can develop and the treatment can delay recovery of CMV-specific immunity.8,12,13,14,15 In order to minimize the use of GCV or foscarnet, many investigators use a pre-emptive treatment strategy performing regular blood monitoring for CMV antigen or DNA (using techniques which have varying sensitivity) and treating at the first indication of viremia.16,17,18,19 An alternative way to reduce the need for ganciclovir or foscarnet is to use high-dose acyclovir (HDACV) (1.5 g/m2/day) as prophylaxis for CMV disease. Although CMV is less sensitive to inhibition by ACV,20 the agent has been used in high doses with partial success in a few studies to prevent or delay CMV reactivation.21,22,23 When administered for up to 6 months post-transplant HDACV also reduced late CMV infection and improved survival when compared to standard treatment doses,22,23 while one study showed no clear benefit using HDACV followed by prophylactic GCV.24 Using a total body irradiation (TBI)-based, T cell-depleted transplant protocol and pre-emptive treatment of CMV antigenemia with GCV, we previously reported a high incidence (25%) of fatal CMV IP in patients at risk from CMV reactivation.25 Subsequently, in all allogeneic transplant patients at risk for CMV infection, we have used HDACV from day \u22127 for 3 months post-transplant in conjunction with weekly CMV antigenemia monitoring and pre-emptive treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and GCV. Here we report the outcome of this strategy in two large cohorts of patients receiving either intensive chemoradiotherapy and a T cell-depleted SCT followed by delayed add-back of donor T cells (TCDT), or a non-myeloablative preparative regimen followed by an unmanipulated peripheral blood SCT (NMT). This strategy was associated with effective control of CMV antigenemia in the majority of patients and near-complete eradication of fatal CMV IP.",

When only seropositive recipients were analyzed, the actuarial probabilities of developing pp65 antigenemia were 88.7% with TCDT and 52.4% with NMT (P < 0.00001). Because patient characteristics with TCDT and NMT were widely different, further risk factor analysis for CMV events was performed separately for each group, and only for seropositive recipients. In both cohorts, age (above or below the median), donor sex match (female into male recipient vs other combinations), or transplant CD34+ and CD3+ cell doses (above or below the median) were not significant factors for CMV reactivation in univariate analysis. Likewise, source of stem cells (BMT vs PBSCT) or disease risk status (high vs standard risk) in TCDT, and use of MMF or disease type (hematologic vs solid tumor) in NMT had no significant impact on the incidence of CMV reactivation.",

With this approach, the overall incidence of CMV disease (early and late) was 5% in TCD and 8% in NMT, and in only one patient death was attributable to CMV pneumonitis in 174 patients at risk for CMV infection. These results are superior to the CMV outcomes in our historic control, in which a pre-emptive GCV approach was also used, starting at the same level of CMV pp65 antigenemia. Therefore, besides differences in patient clinical characteristics, the only practical change for preventing CMV disease was the introduction of HDACV.",

Because this was a single institution, non-randomized study, it was not possible to directly compare our results with other approaches using various CMV detection methods and prophylactic regimens. In a randomized study comparing prophylactic and pre-emptive GCV,9 the incidence of early CMV disease (occurring before day +100) was 2.7% in the prophylactic arm compared to 14.1% in the other arm (P = 0.002). However, survival was similar at all times because the early improvement was offset by increased late CMV disease (16.5% vs 8.3%) and many fungal infections. Subsequently, the same group reported the results of a modified protocol treating pp65 antigenemia at any level (1/300 000 cells modified from 3/300 000 cells in the earlier study). With this, they observed an incidence of early CMV disease of 3.8% and late CMV disease of 13.1%.35",

The incidence of late CMV disease in our TCDT cohort was lower than that reported by other groups. However, it is difficult to attribute this low incidence of late CMV disease to either HDACV or pre-emptive GCV. We continued HDACV and weekly pp65 antigenemia monitoring until day +100 (or longer only if clinically indicated), and it is unclear why there would be any protective effect beyond day +100 in our regimen. This might rather be due to differences in patient characteristics, such as a lower incidence of acute GVHD (48% compared to 75\u201378%), and no mismatched or unrelated transplants in our cohorts. It is possible that our delayed DLI on days +45 (or 30) and +100 might have contributed to immune reconstitution beyond day +100, thereby preventing CMV disease. However, when we analyzed the pattern of CMV pp65 antigenemia before and after day +45 post-transplant, we did not find clear differences between patients who received day +45 (or 30) DLI and those who did not (data not shown). A favorable effect of HDACV can also be discerned by the fact that there was no CMV reactivation or CMV disease in seronegative recipients who received a transplant from a seropositive donor (n = 7 in TCDT, n = 16 in NMT), although the number was small. Overall, our results compared favorably with the original randomized study evaluating HDACV (HDACV arm, day \u22125 to day +180) with regard to the incidence of CMV disease (eight of 105 patients) and infectious death (eight deaths).22",

With this approach, about a third (34/103) of CMV infections never recurred after one course of induction therapy. We identified that a first CMV pp65 antigenemia level greater than 2/400 000 cells was associated with subsequent persistence or relapse, requiring prolonged anti-viral therapy. With regard to CMV disease, acute GVHD and a high number of pp65 positive cells at first reactivation appeared to be associated with subsequent CMV disease. While persistent or recurrent CMV pp65 antigenemia was also common in patients who developed CMV disease (4/5) after TCDT, CMV pp65 antigenemia appeared to be poorly correlated with CMV disease in our NMT cohort.36 In the current study, five of the six patients had no preceding CMV pp65 antigenemia before developing CMV disease. However, one patient, beyond day +100 post transplant was not on regular surveillance at the time of CMV disease. Three other patients underwent bronchoscopy when they developed pulmonary infiltrates and had a positive shell vial culture. All three of these patients also had other microorganisms, and subsequent deaths were attributed to persistent adenovirus infection (UPN 180), grade IV GVHD (UPN 180), or bacterial/fungal pneumonia (UPN 253). Therefore, it is possible that we incidentally found CMV reactivation rather than true CMV disease when they underwent bronchoscopy during the period (days 31\u201349) at which a screening BAL is usually performed for pre-emptive GCV therapy.7",

Because the baseline patient characteristics and transplant methods were so different, we did not believe that we could clearly identify the factors responsible for the difference in the CMV outcome. Possible factors include large T cell dose in NMT, lack of TBI in the conditioning regimen, post-transplant immunosuppression, or different underlying diseases. Studies on CMV outcomes in NMT have been reported mostly in abstract form, and results were mixed. Several studies using antithymocyte globulin or CAMPATH-1H had high rates of CMV infection,37,38,39 whereas a few other groups reported a lower rate of CMV infection and CMV disease.40 Further understanding of immune reconstitution and infection risks after NMT is necessary to optimize the prophylaxis/pre-emptive strategies in this population.",
