Our data suggest that increased TTDS in Black patients with melanoma may be an independent explanatory factor for racial differences in melanoma survival alongside factors such as later stage at presentation, biological differences in melanoma characteristics, and differences in healthcare utilization. 6, 9, 12 Multiple unfavorable socioeconomic factors may exacerbate overall health status more than the additive effects of each of the individual factors. 13 Racial differences in TTDS persisted within each insurance group, implying that insurance status does not fully account for racial TTDS disparities. We found that Black patients also had increased TTDS despite living closer to hospitals, suggesting physical distance from the hospital is not as much of a contributor to TTDS for melanoma as for other cancers (e.g. colorectal). 14 A recent study of three high-risk surgical procedures showed that Black patients lived closer to high-quality hospitals but were 25-58% more likely to receive surgery at low-quality hospitals than NHW patients; it is possible that a similar phenomenon exists in TTDS for melanoma. 15 The quality and availability of melanoma treatment may thus be significantly different between racial groups for reasons other than travel burden . 15 Abbreviations: TTDS, time to definitive surgical treatment; NHW, non-Hispanic white; SD, standard deviation.

Black and NHW patients did not differ by age (p=0.07). Compared to NHW patients, Black patients were more often female (p<0.001) and presented with later stage melanoma (p<0.001). Median household income differed significantly by race (p<0.001). Most NHW patients had a median household income of \u2265$63,000 (41.9%), while most Black patients had a median household income of <$38,000 (32.9%). Insurance status also differed by race, with a greater proportion of Black patients having Medicaid or no insurance than NHW patients (7.0% versus 2.1%, 5.7% versus 2.3%, respectively; p<0.001). On average, Black patients lived closer to the hospital than NHW patients (70.0% versus 61.6% living less than 20 miles from the hospital, p<0.001). Compared to NHW patients, Black patients had increased average TTDS (23.4 days versus 11.7 days, p<0.001) and increased average time to immunotherapy (129.8 days versus 108.3 days, p=0.01). There was no significant difference in time to chemotherapy between Black and NHW patients (123.4 days versus 100.4 days, p=0.10). Stratified by stage, Black patients had increased average TTDS for Stage I, II, and III melanoma (p<0.001) but not Stage IV melanoma (p=0.55; Table 2). Black patients also had increased average TTDS when stratified by insurance type (Table 3). After controlling for sex, age, income, and insurance status, Black patients were significantly more likely than NHW patients to have TTDS between 31-60 days (aOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.74-2.34), 61-90 days (aOR 3.15, 95% CI 2.42-4.02), or >90 days (aOR 5.16, 95% CI 3.84-6.80) (p<0.001 for all;",

            "text": "Efforts to geographically centralize care for melanoma should consider that disparities may be driven by other extrinsic and intrinsic patient-level factors. Creation of a model delineating interactions between the myriad components underlying worse outcomes for Black melanoma patients, including race and insurance status, is critical in identifying targeted avenues for intervention. Difference in disease characteristics by race may also impact time to treatment for melanoma. Black patients more often present with acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) on the lower extremities and have increased Breslow depth and stage at diagnosis for other melanoma subtypes, which portends worse prognosis.16 Several controversies exist in the treatment of ALM that are not present in the treatment of other melanoma subtypes (such as superficial spreading increased TTDS for stages I-III melanoma, but not stage IV melanoma. Racial disparities in time to treatment may thus be less prominent for melanoma that has metastasized. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy are increasingly becoming the standard of care for patients with metastatic melanoma.23 It has been shown that Black patients are less likely to receive immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma and various other cancers after controlling for other sociodemographic factors.23,24 Our research also adds to the growing knowledge base regarding disparities in immunotherapy by showing that Black patients receive immunotherapy an average of 21.5 days differences in TTDS persisted after stratifying by insurance type and melanoma stage.Ultimately, it is important to better understand the various components underlying worse outcomes for Black melanoma patients. Targeted approaches to improve TTDS for Black melanoma patients are integral in reducing racial disparities in melanoma outcomes.",
