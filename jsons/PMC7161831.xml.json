The results were anomalous from the perspective of economic theory as mean ratings of the superior No\u2010Loss and inferior Loss gambles were, respectively, 9.4 and 14.9, that is, the \u201cbets effect.\u201d The effect cannot be explained by averaging (i.e., a choice option may be evaluated as the average of its components) because averaging predicts that adding a 5\u00a2 loss to an option with positive payoffs would make it less attractive (Anderson, 1974; Troutman & Shanteau, 1976). Instead, the effect appeared due to feelings about the $9 that emerged from judges comparing the $9 with the 5\u00a2 loss in the Loss condition and deriving more positive affect to the $9; no such comparison was available in the No\u2010Loss condition. Consistent with this hypothesized process is evidence that integral feelings to the $9 (e.g., participants were asked \u201cHow good or bad is $9?\u201d in both conditions) were quite positive in the Loss condition (as if people used the comparison to understand how they felt about the $9) but were about neutral in the No\u2010Loss condition.",

First, the effect cannot be explained by a response\u2010mode effect as they demonstrated a similar effect whether using the usual 0\u201320 attractiveness rating, freely drawn circles, or a choice between each gamble and a fixed amount. Second, some colleagues have suggested that the presence of the small loss makes the bet more exciting. This explanation, however, was not supported as Bateman et al. demonstrated that the effect was substantially the same when a 5\u00a2 gain replaces the 5\u00a2 loss and that the effect diminished when the 5\u00a2 loss was replaced with a larger (and perhaps more exciting) 25\u00a2 loss. Finally, under conditions of joint evaluation where people rate both bets side by side, the No\u2010Loss bet was judged as more attractive than the Loss bet, indicating little excitement for it.",

In multiple studies, they replicated the bets effect and the small loss's impact on affect to the $9. They also demonstrated that probabilities were easier to evaluate than monetary outcomes for simple gambles such as that in the No\u2010Loss condition. In particular, they suggested that probabilities carry a more precise impression and are weighted more in judgments than monetary payoffs because probabilities are on a bounded scale that allows them to be evaluated as good versus bad without other context whereas a payoff such as $9 is relatively abstract and difficult to evaluate (to feel how good or bad it is) in the absence of a comparison. Finally, they found that attractiveness was correlated primarily with affect for probability in the No\u2010Loss condition and primarily with affect for payoff in the 5\u00a2 Loss condition. Thus, the loss seemed to enhance the affective meaning and importance of the gamble payoff.",

Peters et al. confirmed the hypothesized interaction and the highly numerate's greater positive affect to the $9 partially mediated the effect of the 5\u00a2 loss on bet attractiveness. The interaction was further replicated controlling for nonnumeric intelligence (Peters & Bjalkebring, 2015). It is unclear, however, whether the effect depended on the highly numerate's habit to attend more to numeric outcomes (with subsequent processing then being relatively automatic) or on the highly numerate's greater inclination to do number operations such as the hypothesized comparison process.

First, the more numerate prefer numbers more than the less numerate (Fagerlin et al., 2007). They seek out more information and spend more time on numeric decision tasks compared with the less numerate. In one study, this increased time in task partially mediated numeracy's effects on superior decisions (Ghazal, Cokely, & Garcia\u2010Retamero, 2014). When making choices among gambles, the more numerate attended to and sought out more information, processing numeric information in more depth (Jasper, Bhattacharya, & Corser, 2017). Second, they are more likely to do various number operations. They transform provided numbers into their alternative frame and are less susceptible to framing effects (e.g., 26% mortality = 74% survival and 10% chance to win = 90% chance to lose; Peters et al., 2006; Peters & Levin, 2008; Cokely & Kelley, 2009).

In addition, the less numerate tend to be more susceptible than the highly numerate to incidental affect unrelated to the decision object at hand, using it rather than decision\u2010relevant numeric information (e.g., Peters et al., 2009; Traczyk & Fulawka, 2016). The highly numerate (more than the less numerate) derive greater integral affective meaning from numbers and number comparisons and use that integral affect in their judgments (Peters et al., 2006; Petrova, van der Pligt, & Garcia\u2010Retamero, 2014).

It is possible, however, that greater attention to the numeric outcomes could lead inevitably to the effect.

If true, then their responses may be more labile and prone to preference construction due to this lack of familiarity and experience (Payne, Bettman, & Schkade, 1999). In the present paper, we examine this possibility by testing whether extremely numerate individuals with vastly more experience with numbers and probabilities nonetheless would demonstrate a similar bets effect.Individuals who have extensive experience with and understanding of monetary values and probabilities (accountants in Study 1 and actuaries in Study 2) would demonstrate the Loss versus No\u2010Loss bets effect.\n",

Thus, numeracy differences in inclinations for number operations may not exist. Instead, the highly numerate may simply have a habit of attending more to numbers; the number comparison and other processes then may ensue for all individuals once they attend to the numbers.Making the 5\u00a2 loss or the $9 win in the Loss bet more salient would encourage all individuals to attend to and process information in a manner similar to the highly numerate in the Original Loss condition (Study 3).\n",

We replicated the findings not only with nonstudent adult participants but also with two particularly expert and numerate samples that allowed us to test whether earlier results might have depended on those participants' lack of experience with monetary values and probabilities. The results with actuaries and accountants clearly indicated otherwise. Their substantially greater expertise with monetary outcomes and probabilities (as compared with prior samples), however, did not protect them from demonstrating the bets effect. We conclude that both actuaries and accountants have a stable inclination, based on their high numeric abilities, to do number operations such as the hypothesized comparison process of the present bets effect. Nonetheless, some questions remain. The actuaries' free responses did not point directly to the hypothesized number comparison process (although their more positive affect to the $9 in the presence versus absence of the loss was consistent with it). Also unclear was whether less numerate populations cannot show the bets effect due to their lower ability, or whether they can be encouraged to attend to and/or compare the monetary outcomes and thereby show the bets effect.",

First, because the comparison of the $9 and 5\u00a2 was not possible in the No\u2010Loss condition, we examined a possible numeracy difference in the Loss condition only. Consistent with the bets effect and a tendency for number comparisons, 26.4% of the highly numerate mentioned comparing the $9 with the 5\u00a2 loss compared with only 12.5% of the less numerate, Wald \u03c72(df = 1) = 5.26, p = .022. For the remaining coded responses, logistic regressions were conducted for each coded response with condition (0 = Loss, 1 = No\u2010Loss), numeracy, and their interaction as predictors. We describe here only those codes that resulted in a significant interaction as they would be the most likely explanations of the bets effect (for additional results, see note a of Table 3). Only two significant interactions, both concerning probabilities, emerged between numeracy and bet condition. Among the less numerate, a smaller proportion identified the probability of winning in the Loss versus No\u2010Loss condition (55.0% and 78.0%, respectively, vs. the highly numerate 69.8% and 71.4%, respectively), interaction b = \u2212.45, Wald \u03c72(df = 1) = 4.64, p = .031.

Thus, whereas the highly numerate demonstrated more evidence of comparing the $9 with the 5\u00a2 loss, the less numerate may have found the probability of winning less salient in the Loss condition as if the addition of the 5\u00a2 loss distracted them from the possibility of winning. This possibility is not entirely consistent with the attractiveness results, however, because the less numerate did rate the Loss bet as somewhat higher than the No\u2010Loss bet (although less so than the highly numerate).",

They may have found the bet more attractive with Study 4's instruction to consider what they would do with their winnings; however, although the interaction of instruction with numeracy was significant, the effect on the less numerate (based on a median split) was marginal and the interaction effect was nonsignificant after controlling for shared variance between numeracy and vocabulary, nonnumeric reasoning, and NFC. Past literature points towards the less numerate relying more on simpler and often nonnumeric information in judgments (e.g., incidental emotions) whereas the more numerate use concurrently presented numbers instead (Traczyk & Fulawka, 2016).

When then shown the comparison to their personal numeric risk, they felt relieved and less at risk for breast cancer. More and less objectively numerate women responded similarly as if all individuals had compared the two numbers. Such lack of a numeracy effect could be due to these probabilities being easier to evaluate (similar to the ease of processing probabilities in the bets task). We think it more likely that health motivation played a role and that all women were powerfully motivated to understand their personal risk. Findings such as these may help researchers to identify boundary conditions so that we can better understand the conditions under which more and less numerate individuals compare versus do not compare numbers. In the present bets task, the highly numerate were more likely to; the less numerate, however, could when instructed in Study 3. Identifying boundary conditions for information processing is important, both theoretically and practically. It seems likely that differentiation by numeracy will occur more often when motivation is low, comparisons are not salient, and attentional resources are limited (Gilbert, Pelham, & Krull, 1988).

Not all dual\u2010process models are identical, however, and they make some different predictions, particularly with respect to two questions important to the present bets effect. First, the theories differ in terms of which process is thought to produce superior decisions. Popular default\u2010interventionist theories (also called serial\u2010interventionist models) assume that the intuitive System 1 process provides generally reasonable default responses that guide behavior; the deliberative System 2 then may detect an error and override the intuition, replacing it with a better, reflective response (e.g., Kahneman, 2003; Stanovich, 2009; Stanovich & West, 2000). Thus, the deliberative process produces superior judgments and decisions. Because numeracy is considered a deliberative process and greater numeracy is associated with a greater nonnormative bets effect, default\u2010interventionist theories are inconsistent with these findings. The effect, however, is consistent with fuzzy trace theory (FTT; Reyna, Lloyd, & Brainerd, 2003; Reyna et al., 2009) as well as interactive dual\u2010process theories (cognitive\u2010experiential self\u2010theory, Epstein, 1994, 2000; affect heuristic, Slovic et al., 2002; Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2004) that have sometimes been grouped incorrectly with default\u2010interventionist theories (e.g., Reyna et al., 2009). Both types of dual\u2010process theories allow for better or worse decisions to emerge from either process. Epstein (2000), for example, states \u201cThis is not meant to suggest that the [deliberative] mind is always superior. The inferential, [deliberative] mind and the learning, experiential mind each has its advantages and disadvantages\u201d (p. 671).",

(2006) suggested that the integral affect was due to the highly numerate deliberating more with numbers to produce the affective input; in other words, the dual processes interact to inform one another and the judgment itself. Default\u2010interventionist theories are inconsistent with the two processes interacting in this manner; they allow for System 2 to correct an incorrect System 1 response but not to provide an informative affective response to System 1. Interactive theories do allow for complex interactions between the two processes. Thus, in the affect heuristic, for example, \u201cWe now recognize that the experiential mode of thinking and the analytic model of thinking are continually active, interacting in what we have characterized as \u2018the dance of affect and reason\u2019 \u201d (Slovic et al., 2004, p. 314).
