            "text": "Feline calicivirus (FCV) is one of the most common viral pathogens of cats, especially in multi-cat environments such as shelters and catteries. FCV infection and disease occurs in acute and chronic forms (reviewed by Studdert, 1978, Reubel et al., 1992). The manifesting signs of acute disease depends on the route (oral versus aerosol) and strain of virus. Aerosol infection, which is commonly used in laboratory studies, produces a more serious disease than oral infection, with lesions extending further down the respiratory tract. Hoover and Kahn (1975) described the acute disease produced by 10 field strains of FCV. The disease differed only in severity, with the more virulent strains causing fever, depression, dyspnea, pneumonia, and vesicles/ulcers of the tongue, hard palate and nostrils. Lower virulence strains were less likely to affect the lungs, although other signs were similar. Transient mild conjunctivitis and rhinitis, has also been associated with acute FCV infection, but unlike pathogens such as feline herpesvirus, upper respiratory involvement is not the major feature of FCV infection. Pedersen and colleagues (1983) added the feature of \u2018limping\u2019 to the FCV disease syndrome. The lameness appears to be associated with acute viremia and localization of virus and/or immune complexes in the joints (Bennett et al., 1989, Dawson et al., 1994). Following recovery from acute disease, up to one-fourth of cats will shed the virus for a prolonged period of time from their oropharynx (Bennett et al., 1989, Harbour et al., 1991; Dawson et al., 1993a, Dawson et al., 1993b). Although most FCV carriers are asymptomatic, a small proportion will develop a distinct disease syndrome known as chronic plasmacytic/lymphocytic stomatitis or chronic ulceroproliferative stomatitis (Reubel et al., 1992). This chronic oral disease is progressive and extremely difficult to treat and is perhaps the single most important clinical manifestation of FCV infection today.",

Related caliciviruses, such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, have been associated with severe clinical disease and high mortality. Although recognized strains of FCV have not been associated with significant acute mortality, the calicivirus genome is highly mutable (Johnson, 1992, Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995, Geissler et al., 1997, Kreutz et al., 1998, Radford et al., 1998) and more highly virulent strains could arise at any time. The present report describes the sudden appearance and disappearance of a novel strain of FCV, which induced a severe systemic hemorrhagic-like fever and high mortality. The new strain, named FCV-Ari, has weak to negligible cross-reactivity to current vaccine-induced immunity and would pose considerable risk to cats if it were to spread widely among either vaccinated or unvaccinated animals.",

Ria presented on 12 October 1998 with a primary complaint of 24 h of lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Physical examination was uninformative except for fever. Tests for FeLV and FIV infections were negative and CBC and blood chemistry analyses were unremarkable. A slight swelling of the dorsal muzzle, extending from one canthus to the other, was observed that afternoon. Shortly thereafter, hair over the right side of the muzzle epilated, revealing a 5 mm diameter erythematous patch with a dark necrotic center. Ria was sent home for observation, but returned on 14 October 1998 still lethargic, anorectic and febrile. Additional lesions, with focal crusting, erythema and epilation, were present on the right and left medial canthi, commissures of the mouth, and on the margins of both pinnae. The patient also demonstrated diffuse cutaneous edema of the face and submandibular area and extending down the limbs. Biopsies were taken from the muzzle and pinnae lesions and swabs of several sores were collected for routine aerobic bacterial culture. Ria was still febrile on 15 October 1998, but did not appear to be in discomfort and was beginning to eat and groom. Skin biopsies taken on 14 October 1998 revealed multifocal moderate to severe neutrophilic/lymphoplasmacytic perivascular and periadnexal dermatitis, superficial pyoderma, and extensive ulceration and superficial dermal necrosis with underlying vasculitis. No infectious organisms were observed in routine or special stained tissues sections and no aerobic bacteria grew in culture. Ria was treated with prednisolone and antibiotics; within the next 2 days she was eating well and actively grooming, the cutaneous edema was resolving, and the skin lesions were healing.",

There were no significant past health problems; he tested negative for FeLV and FIV infections and had been parenterally vaccinated against rabies and FPHCV on 10 April 1997 Ari presented on 19 October 1998 with a history of an acute onset of lethargy and anorexia of 2 days duration. A slight lameness in the right foreleg was noted 2 days prior but had spontaneously resolved. The patient had vomited a bile tinged fluid with flecks of red blood. Physical examination revealed fever and a small crusty lesion on the lower lip. Ari returned to the hospital on 21 October 1998 afebrile and alert, but moderately dehydrated and anorectic. Diffuse facial edema with central ulceration were noted, primarily over the muzzle and left pinna; focal crusty and erythematous lesions were also present on the upper and lower lips. Intravenous fluids, metoclopramide and antibiotic therapy were instituted. Ari was afebrile on 22 October 1998 but anorectic. The facial swelling was mildly increased but the central ulcerated areas seemed to be less exudative. The patient\u2019s right forepaw was slightly edematous. Ari was still afebrile on 23 October 1998 but remained anorectic; the edema of the right forepaw remained unchanged. The patient was transported to the UC Davis VMTH for additional testing, including blood and nasal swabs for virus isolation and blood for chemistry and coagulation profiles. Blood chemistries revealed moderate elevation of CPK, mild elevation of total bilirubin, and moderate hypoproteinemia. There was evidence of a coagulopathy with moderately increased prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times and a slightly prolonged activated clotting time (ACT). A FCV was isolated in cell cultures exposed to both blood and nasal exudate. Ari was still euthermic on 24 October 1998; however, he was anorectic and his entire face was edematous. The facial lesions had coalesced to form large irregular crusts on both sides of the muzzle (Fig. 1\n), and the mucus membranes were slightly icteric. A nasoesophogeal feeding tube was positioned and oral hyperalimentation instituted; this therapy that would be continued until his death. Ari seemed more responsive on 25 October 1998, although still anorectic and hypocoagulable. The patient appeared comfortable on 26 October 1998; there was no more vomiting, but the subcutaneous edema of the right foreleg was persisting. Ari was transfused with one unit of whole blood and low level heparin therapy was instituted to counteract a suspected disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Dextran 70 was given initially as an IV bolus and then maintained as a continuous infusion. Laboratory tests taken in the evening of 26 October indicated a persisting coagulopathy, hypoproteinemia, and hyperbilibubinemia. Ari was alert, responsive, and afebrile on the morning of 27 October; however, he was diffusely edematous, had mild watery diarrhea and exhibited a slightly increased respiratory rate and effort. Laboratory work revealed a decreased hematocrit, hypoproteinemia and greatly elevated ACT. The patient was then given a second unit of cross matched whole blood. The respiratory rate continued to increase throughout the day and a thoracocentesis was performed late that evening and a yellowish-transudate withdrawn. Ari was alert and responsive on 28 October 1998, but still anorectic. The patient received a third unit of whole blood at mid-day and more pleural fluid was removed. On 29 October 1998, Ari was quiet, responsive and vocal when handled, but polypneic and totally anorectic. A chest tube was placed to facilitate thoracic drainage and the dextran 70 replaced with hetastarch. Ari was still anorectic and lethargic on the morning of 30 October; he was diffusely edematous with small areas of miliary crusting noted in areas of greatest swelling, especially on the distal limbs. Despite treatment, Ari\u2019s condition slowly deteriorated and he died on 8 November 1998 from complications of pneumothorax, shock and cardiac arrest. A FCV, genetically indistinguishable from the earlier isolate, was recovered from blood and tissues at post-mortem examination.",

Previous clinical history included a negative FeLV/FIV test on August 1998 and routine parenteral vaccination for rabies and FPHCV on 2 June 1998. Ian became febrile on 22 October 1998 and was lethargic and sneezing occassionally. Physical examination revealed mild edema of his muzzle with patchy erythematous macules and miliary crusts on margins of both pinnae. Ian was transported to UC Davis, VMTH for consultations with one of the authors (NCP) and a veterinary dermatolgist (Dr. Peter Ihrke). Blood and nasal swabs were collected and the cat returned home. A FCV, which was genetically identical to the isolate from Ari, was obtained in tissue cultures from both blood and nasal exudate. On 23 October 1998, Ian was still febrile at home but was eating and drinking. The facial and pinna swellings were increasing and new crusts were present on his pinnae and around his nares. Ian continued to do well at home on 24 October, although the owner reported sneezing and nasal congestion.

Emma presented on 4 November 1998 with a history of 2 days of lethargy and anorexia. Her physical examination was unremarkable except for fever, moderate dehydration and possible abdominal tenderness. The patient was hospitalized and started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Presenting lab work revealed a slightly elevated total blood bilirubin and glucose. FeLV and FIV tests were negative. On 5 November 1998, Emma was depressed, anorectic, febrile and hyperirritable. The fever increased by evening and her left hind paw appeared swollen. Emma was still anorectic on 6 November 1998 but was much more alert; rectal temperatures continued to be elevated and her right hind paw was swollen. Emma remained anorectic on 7 November 1998, her hind paws remained swollen and slight swelling was observed on the muzzle. Small areas of ecchymosis were noted on the right caudal abdomen. A naso-esophageal feeding tube was inserted and the patient was started on a full strength hyperalimentation solution. The next morning Emma became restless and mildly dyspneic, with pronounced decreases in the hematocrit and total plasma proteins. Emma was started on vigorous treatment for a developing hypoproteinemia and DIC; therapy included intravenous Hetastarch, subcutaneous heparin, intravenous antibiotics, and nasoesophageal tube feeding. The patient\u2019s respiratory rate continued to increase throughout the day even though her fever abated. A chest tube was placed but only small amounts of a transudate were withdrawn. She became progressively more dypneic and depressed throughout the day and was hypothermic by midnight. Results of laboratory tests taken in the evening revealed a moderate hypoproteinemia, hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia. Blood tests taken on 8 November 1998 showed an elevated glucose, decreased hematocrit and total protein, and a prolonged ACT. Emma\u2019s condition continued to decline throughout the day, with increasing respiratory difficulty.

The four cats had not been exposed to other agents and were quarantined from other cats through separate ante-rooms, and were cared for by different caretakers. The caretakers took extra precautions in terms of disposable overalls, gloves, boots, and foot baths, as well as separate food and litter sources, to prevent inadvertent infections from the outside. On the morning of 13 November 1998, one of the four cats (97-659) in this group was found dead and the other three animals were depressed and febrile. Gross necropsy findings showed a reddened and somewhat swollen pancreas with areas of hemorrhage and saponification in peripancreatic mesenteric fat. Several large areas of yellow-tinged subcutaneous edema were observed in the groin and trunks. The lungs appeared grossly congested with many areas of collapse, and there was a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen and chest cavities. The condition of the remaining three cats rapidly deteriorated, in spite of antibiotic, fluid and whole blood therapy. Cat 96-101 was in shock on 18 November 1998 and euthanatized. The remaining two cats (96-179 and 97-680) were still febrile on 19 November 1998 but were becoming rapidly more depressed; a decision was made to euthanatize them rather than to continue symptomatic treatment. Blood chemistry panels taken near the time of death from all four animals revealed mild to moderate elevations in blood glucose, moderately decreased serum total proteins, and mild to moderate hyperbilirubinemia. Gross necropsy findings in the three latter cats were identical to those observed in the first cat. All three cats had reddened and swollen-appearing pancreases with hemorrhage and saponification of peripancreatic fat. In addition to these findings, cat 97-680 had an edematous omentum, ulceration of the skin on the phalanges of the right hindleg, sloughing of the claw on second digit of the right hindleg, an ulcer of the skin under the jaw, a yellowish edema under the tongue and icteric appearing nictitating membranes. Cat 96-179, in addition to pancreatic lesions, had congestion and consolidation of the right lung lobes, an edematous omentum, and splenomegaly. Cat 96-101 had identical lesions on the pancreas and surrounding tissues, but also had subcutaneous edema with yellowing of the tissues of the hind limbs and edema of all four paws. CrFK and Fcwf-4 cell cultures of blood and pancreatic tissue from all four cats yielded FCV. Genetic sequencing of FCV isolates from all four cats showed them to be identical to FCV-Ari (data not shown). Maximum quarantine was initiated at the time of the secondary outbreak; the virus was only handled under the strictest of quarantine conditions, with special isolation facilities, separate caretakers, complete changes of disposable coveralls, gloves, and foot coverings. No additional cases were observed in either the clinic of origin or in the experimental animal facilities after this time.",

The route and dosage were identical to the initial experimental infection study. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated cats became febrile within 24 h, and the fever persisted for 5\u20136 days (Fig. 4\n). The febrile responses were slightly lower and about 1 day shorter in duration in vaccinated versus unvaccinated cats. Clinical signs were similar in both groups, but noticeably less severe in vaccinates than nonvaccinates. Clinical signs included transient anorexia, dehydration, lameness, slight ocular and nasal discharge, mild sneezing, swelling of the face with occasional ulceration, edema of the pinnae with ulceration or crusting of the edges, and variable swelling of the lower limbs. There appeared to be no relationship between whether the cats were still shedding FCV-F9 vaccine virus at the time of challenge-exposure and subsequent disease severity; cat 98-382, a vaccine virus carrier, was almost as symptomatic as the nonvaccinates. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated cats were treated with subcutaneous lactated ringers solution for several days, but all animals made a rapid uncomplicated recovery starting at Days 5\u20137 post-infection. Virus shedding, as measured by both tissue culture isolation and PCR, from the oral cavity was observed in both nonvaccinates following FCV-Ari challenge-exposure and in 3/4 vaccinates (Table 4). Virus shedding lasted from 1\u20133 weeks; no cats were still shedding calicivirus by culture or PCR after Week 10. Virus shed at the time of FCV-Ari challenge-exposure and earlier was of the F9 strain, while virus shed after challenge was entirely of the FCV-Ari strain as determined by sequence analysis (data not shown).",

            "text": "FCV is endemic in most catteries, shelters and large multiple cat households, where up to one-fourth of cats may be orally shedding the virus at any given time (Bennett et al., 1989, Harbour et al., 1991; Dawson et al., 1993a, Dawson et al., 1993b). FCV exists in numerous overlapping serotypes but is basically a single species (Gillespie and Scott, 1973). Different strains vary somewhat in the main types of disease signs that they cause (Hoover and Kahn, 1975, Pedersen et al., 1983, Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995), but these differences are hard to discern from genetic or serologic comparisons (Dawson et al., 1993a, Dawson et al., 1993b; Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995, Geissler et al., 1997, TeeWee et al., 1997). Although original descriptions of FCV infection suggested that it might be a major cause of mortality in young cats, this has not been borne out by subsequent experimental studies. So-called highly virulent strains of FCV, such as FCV-255 (Gillespie and Scott, 1973), can exist in breeding populations of cats without significant disease; kittens being infected from 3\u20139 weeks of age when they still have significant levels of passive immunity (Johnson and Povey, 1984). Clinical disease can be of acute or chronic form. Acute disease, when it is seen, is generally systemic with vesicular involvement of the oral cavity (ulcers on palate, tongue, inflammation of gums and oral fauces), arthropathy (limping) and mild interstitial pneumonia (Hoover and Kahn, 1975, Pedersen et al., 1983, Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995, TeeWee et al., 1997). Upper respiratory disease is relatively uncommon, associated with certain strains much more than others, and manifested as a mild and transient bilateral conjunctivitis and rhinitis (compare FCV-263351 and FCV-Cook in Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995). A viremia is detectable during the first week of infection (Pedersen et al., 1983), and oral shedding occurs for several weeks to months (reviewed by Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995). The source of viral carriage and shedding appears to be the tonsils and surrounding mucosa (Dick et al., 1989).",

The dates that this particular animal was in the clinic both preceded and overlapped the dates when client-owned cats were exposed.

Elevations in CPK also indicated myonecrosis.

Similarities included the high mortality, acute nature, the tendency to cause more severe disease in older animals, the ease of spread, hepatocyte tropism, and widespread vascular disease. Following its apperance in China, RHD spread throughout Europe, where it caused severe disease in rabbits but mild to unapparent infections in hares (Mitro and Krauss, 1993). A closely related calicivirus, the European Brown Hare Syndrome Virus (EBHS virus) (Bascu\u00f1ana et al., 1997), affects both wild and farmed hares, and was also first reported in the 1980s in Europe. Both viruses cause severe necrotizing hepatitis and widespread hemorrhaging. The disease caused by the RHDV is particularly severe, with mortalities approaching 100% in rabbits older than 8 weeks of age (Nowotny et al., 1990, Nowotny et al., 1991). The high species specificity and virulence of RHDV led the Australian government to experiment on the virus as a means to control wild rabbits (Kovaliski, 1998). Experiments conducted on an offshore island showed the potential of the virus as a biologic agent, but before a final decision for controlled release could be made, the RHDV appeared in wild rabbits on the mainland. The virus spread rapidly, with over 97% mortality on wild rabbit populations recorded for one region of South Australia (Mutze et al., 1998).",

The virus is definitely more virulent than any FCV strain yet tested by one of the authors (NCP) or reported in literature.

RHDV causes a mild self-limiting infection in rabbits less than 8 weeks of age, while the mortality approaches 100% in older animals (Mutze et al., 1998). Inherent resistance factors also seemed to play a role; some individual cats developed mild self-limiting disease, while others were devastated by the infection. The close genetic relationship of Ria, Ari and Ian could have contributed to the severity of their illness. At least one of the cats (Ari) was also treated with prednisolone early in the course of his infection, in the belief that the disease was some sort of immune vasculitis. However, another cat (Emma) in the initial outbreak, and several laboratory cats, were not treated with prednisolone and had a similar fatal disease course.",

Antibodies against the universal FCV-F9 vaccine strain also did not significantly cross-react with FCV-Ari, and laboratory cats immunized by the oral route with FCV-F9 6 weeks prior to challenge-exposure possessed only a small measure of immunity. Two field cats that died of the infection (Ari and Emma) had been previously immunized for FCV also indicating that current FCV vaccines, given by prescribed parenteral routes, will not protect against FCV-Ari.",
