PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, and its genome is approximately 28 kb in length and is composed of seven open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2\u20136) [3, 4]. Four structural proteins, namely, the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein, and one accessory protein, ORF3, are encoded by ORF2\u20136 [4, 5]. Among the structural proteins, the S protein is the major envelope glycoprotein responsible for receptor binding and cell membrane fusion and entry [6, 7]. Therefore, the S protein is considered the main target for neutralizing antibodies against PEDV and has been frequently used in phylogenetic analysis, establishment of serologic diagnostic methods, and development of new vaccines.",

Furthermore, new highly virulent PEDV strains emerged in China at the end of 2010 and caused large economic losses [9, 10]. Starting in the spring of 2013, the PEDV variant outbreaks were successively reported in the United States (US) and subsequently spread to other countries in North America and Europe [5, 11\u201313]. Although attenuated and inactivated PEDV vaccines have been developed and widely used in Asia for many years, severe PEDV outbreaks have still been reported in recent years [14\u201316]. The main reason for this result is that vaccines based on European and other classical PEDV strains failed to control the more recent virulent PEDV strains in Asia [5, 14]. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to develop new PEDV vaccines from highly virulent variants of the virus.",

Therefore, many studies have been carried out for the development of next-generation PEDV vaccines based on the S protein, such as a recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine [19], a recombinant DNA plasmid vaccine [20], an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium vaccine [21], a recombinant Parapoxvirus vaccine [22], a recombinant orf virus (ORFV) vaccine [23], and a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vaccine [24]. Moreover, the first commercial PEDV vaccine used in the US, called the iPED vaccine, was based on a truncated version of the PEDV spike gene and a pVEK replicon vector derived from the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus [14]. The vaccine induced immunity in young pigs after two doses given intramuscularly (IM) in a three-week interval, significantly reduced the severity of clinical signs (diarrhea), and reduced viral shedding for the first 72 hours [14]. Going forward, new genetically engineered vaccines will be an important direction for the development of PEDV in the future.",

However, to date, PEDV commercial vaccines cannot completely prevent and control PEDV infection, so it is still necessary to develop new vaccines and to improve current PEDV vaccine efficacy. Currently, recombinant live vector vaccines are a new hot research topic in the development of vaccines and have been widely applied in many human and animal vaccine development attempts [31, 32]. In the recent work on development of a PEDV vaccine, several recombinant live vector vaccines based on the PEDV S protein were constructed successively [19, 22, 23]. These recombinant live vector vaccines both elicited protective immunity against the PEDV challenge in piglets and demonstrated the potential of recombinant live vectors as a vaccine delivery platform capable of eliciting passive immunity against PEDV. Therefore, in this study, a recombinant adenovirus expressing the spike protein of genotype GIIa PEDV was constructed successfully, and its immunogenicity and protective efficiency as a vaccine candidate were evaluated in 4-week-old pigs.",

The same result can also be found in this study. Although rAd-PEDV-S could induce high levels of specific antibodies, its efficacy was limited. Therefore, future studies should be carried out to further improve this vaccine candidate, such as increasing the immune dose, reducing the side effects of the adenovirus vector, and selecting the appropriate immunization route.",

Protecting suckling piglets through lactogenic immunity is dependent on the gut-mammary-sIgA axis [8]. The results here showed that there is a good correlation between the levels of serum IgG and IgA induced by rAd-PEDV-S and proved that the adenovirus vector construct is capable of eliciting humoral immunity and protection against PEDV infection in neonatal piglets. However, in the next study, rAd-PEDV-S should be used to immunize pregnant sows to determine whether it produces sIgA antibodies that are secreted in the colostrum and milk and ultimately transferred to suckling piglets (gut-mammary-sIgA axis).",

After the challenge, typical clinical signs of PEDV infection were observed in all four groups from 1 to 7 dpi. The results demonstrated that rAd-PEDV-S and the inactivated vaccine could markedly delay clinical signs, reduce virus shedding, and provide partial protection against the highly virulent PEDV challenge. The possible reasons for the low protective efficacy of rAd-PEDV-S and the inactivated vaccine in pigs are as follows: the inoculation dose in pigs in the challenge study was relatively higher than that in most of the previous PEDV animal experiments. Generally, most PEDV animal experiments use 100 TCID50 virus as an inoculum. However, here, 1 \u00d7 105 TCID50 highly virulent genotype GIIb PEDV strain was used as the inoculum in the pig challenge study. Although our previous study determined that the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD50) of the challenge strain CH/HNPJ/2017 was 8.63 log10 PDD50/3 mL at 7 dpi, the experimental animals were 4-day-old conventional suckling pigs [28]. Therefore, the challenge inoculum dose in the present study cannot be completely in accordance with the previous PDD50. The results of this study indicated that a suitable inoculum dose is very important for a PEDV infection study and should be determined in advance in various ages of pigs.",
