The prolonged incubation time and virus shedding from asymptomatic infected cases have allowed the virus to spread quickly and to avoid medical detection and containment. Current estimates of SARS-CoV-2 occurrence are heavily biased toward regions where medical screening of individuals is under way. In contrast, resource-poor regions remain under-tested and disease occurrence underreported. While some countries are now trying to test every individual (e.g., Iceland) to obtain population-wide data, this approach is impractical, slow, and cost-prohibitive for most nations around the world.",

            "text": "Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been identified as a population-wide infectious disease surveillance tool featuring a proven track record for polio and hepatitis A (Asghar et al., 2014; Hellm\u00e9r et al., 2014), and holds considerable promise for population-wide surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic. When first proposed for tracking of SARS-CoV-2, the prevailing scientific opinion was that the virus may be shed into wastewater at insufficiently high rates, and that both the virus itself and its RNA may be too labile to facilitate detection in wastewater. Recent reports of coronavirus shedding in human stool (Gao et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020; Jiehao et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a, Zhang et al., 2020b, Zhang et al., 2020c, Zhang et al., 2020d, Zhang et al., 2020e) and three preliminary reports of successful SARS-CoV-2 detection in municipal wastewater from the Netherlands the United States and Australia have dispelled some of these concerns (Ahmed et al., 2020, Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020, Medema et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Yet, considerable uncertainty remains as to what information may be gleaned from monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and whether a WBE assay, once perfected and shown to be reproducible across different laboratories, will be sensitive enough to inform public health responses. Better population-wide data could aid in reducing the economic damage and social burden placed on populations dealing with stay-at-home ordinances, furlough and involuntary unemployment. At present, public health interventions are implemented with a broad brush; potentially excluding communities that would benefit from them and putting a burden on areas where the virus may currently not pose a threat, thereby rendering hardship-inducing containment measures not only ineffective but also economically and socially disruptive.",

This is based on the presence of between a reported 600,000 (Zhang et al., 2020e) to 30,000,000 (W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020) viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2 per mL of fecal material, and assuming a fecal load of 100\u2013400 g feces/day/person with a density of 1.06 g/mL (Brown et al., 1996). A further refinement of the lower and upper bounds estimate is desirable and will be informed by future studies providing more comprehensive information on virus shedding by symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals.",

This implies that the practical limit of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in community wastewater is well within the useful range and potentially superior to the alternative approach of randomly testing of 100 to 2 million people to establish presence or absence of symptomatic or asymptomatic cases in a population of interest. The relationship between virus concentration, water use and SARS-CoV-2 detectability is shown in Fig. 1\n. The plot is useful for determining the theoretical detection limits. However, practical detection limits for the virus may be lower, due to potential loss of qRT PCR signal in the sewer from virus degradation and RNA loss.",

            "text": "In the absence of seasonal temperature fluctuation, a biomarker discharged into the wastewater collection system at a constant rate would degrade at a rate proportional to its residence time in the system and arrive available for observation at some downstream sampling location at a seasonally invariant rate. However, in actuality, wastewater temperature varies seasonally, and its modulation over the course of a year differs around the world (Hart and Halden, 2020a). Seasonal changes in air and soil temperature affect the transfer of heat between wastewater and the surrounding environment (Fig. 2\n, panel A). Thus, temperature-adjusted degradation of such a biomarker will not be constant over a year, and instead may vary significantly as shown here for a use case, the city of Tempe, AZ, USA (Fig. 2, panel B). As a result, the same hypothetical constant loading deposited into the sewer upstream will result in different masses available for observation at the downstream monitoring location (Fig. 2, panel C). All else held constant, the degree to which the same seasonality in wastewater temperature will affect downstream observations will increase with increasing in-sewer travel times \u2013 i.e., it will be magnified for outfalls serving larger sewersheds, and be more subtle in locations serving smaller sewersheds. We recently showed that failing to account for the role that temperature plays in the degradation of biomarkers can lead to the propagation of error into estimates of upstream discharge, consumption, exposure, and excretion (Hart and Halden, 2020a). The SARS-CoV-2 virus is no exception to this rule. Ignoring temperature effects puts decision-makers at risk of misjudging the public health status and of over- or under-reacting in the selection and implementation of infectious disease control interventions. The effects of temperature adjustment are magnified for longer in-sewer travel times; however, they are evident in some form at every real-world in-sewer travel time (Fig. 2, panel C). WBE studies which do not adjust their monitoring results to temperature will risk significant under- or over-estimation of the true temporal changes occurring in virus shedding within the community (Fig. 2, panel D). Previous studies reporting on the use of WBE for detecting SARS-CoV-2 had very limited surveillance durations (Ahmed et al., 2020; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020); rendering temperature a marginal factor overall. However, as WBE becomes more common and is being practiced long-term across the changing seasons and differing climate regions, its potentially pronounced effects will have to be taken into consideration in order to obtain robust data and to inform selection of an appropriate public health response.",

Here, we applied this model to examine annual changes in wastewater in locations representing past, present and emerging hot zones of the COVID-19 pandemic; for illustrative purposes, we also include the study use case, the city of Tempe, that thus far has reported relatively fewer cases and a low frequency of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (unpublished data). Fig. 3\nprovides an overview of global locations considered here and the estimated wastewater temperature over the course of the year. Annual temperature swings were most pronounced for the city of Detroit, USA and least pronounced but still notable for the cities of Tempe and New Orleans, USA. Application of the average estimated half-life of 5.95 h calculated in Table 1 and use of the kinetic rate of transformation adjusted according to the Q10 rule (Eqs. (2), (3)), enabled the calculation of the maximum time a virus load can spend in the sewer line on route to the sampling location before it falls below the estimated limit of detection of qRT PCR. The latter was based conservatively on a loading of 600,000 viral genomes/mL feces (Zhang et al., 2020e) and a wastewater generation rate of 370 L/person/d (Fig. 3). Accordingly, low temperatures of wastewater of the city of Detroit, USA in the winter would enable detection of the virus target even after almost 100 h of in-sewer travel time; however, in the summer the tolerable duration would be reduced down to 20 h. Whereas temperature-related swings in the detectability of SARS-CoV-2 were much less pronounced in Madrid, Spain and Tempe, USA, the relatively higher water temperatures (when compared to Detroit, USA) result in maximum travel times prior to loss of signal of 38 h or less in both locations (Fig. 3).",

The impact of failing to account for wastewater temperature in back-calculating upstream health metrics increases during the summer and with longer in-sewer travel times (Fig. 4\n; shown for 0.25\u20135 h). In Fig. 4, this is illustrated by different loading scenarios and travel times that would be required in order to observe a constant theoretical signal of 100 million virus genomes per unit time passing through the centralized monitoring location in the various COVID-19-impacted cities. A continued observation of the same viral counts in May, June, July, and August as were seen in January, February, and early March would suggest that the case load is stable and the epidemic reasonably managed. However, when taking temperature changes into account, model predictions show that the number of infected individuals actually must have tripled during that time period (300% increase; Fig. 4; Wuhan and Tempe). This is magnified by the residence time of the virus in the sewer (i.e., the spatial distribution of infected and healthy individuals within a sewershed), which remains a large source of uncertainty in WBE.",

Using the City of Tempe as a case study, the pronounced difference in the composition of a sewershed outfall's sample makeup during the winter and summer months is further illustrated in Fig. 5\n. Here, the model-simulated in-sewer travel time is mapped to the nearest building footprint using an actual, as-built, city sewer network. Modeling results show that, during winter months, the sewershed is captured more evenly and the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 sampled at the basin's outfall represent more closely the COVID-19 status of the sewershed's population as a whole. During the summer months, wastewater sampling at the outfall will reflect the health status of individuals living closer to the WBE sampling location, and the measurements marginalize or do not capture at all the health status of household members residing near the sewershed's edges. This phenomenon of seasonal differences influencing how far WBE \u201ccan see up the sewer line\u201d and how the demographics of the surveilled population changes as a result of contracting and expanding effective area observed had been described previously for chemical markers by our team (Hart and Halden, 2020a, Hart and Halden, 2020b).",

This implies that comprehensive screening of a nation's population using individual test kits is not only expensive (approximately $1.25 billion USD for Germany for assay reagents only) but also impractically slow (3 months, during which major changes can occur in the prevalence of the virus in the community). In contrast, all of Germany's 9636 wastewater treatment plants could easily be sampled and analyzed within 24 to 48 h, due to the country's favorable transportation and testing infrastructure, at a cost for reagents alone of only $145,000 USD. In this case, the cost for WBE surveillance reagents would constitute only 0.014% of those required for clinical testing of individuals. This implies that testing this nation's wastewater millions of times over again would still be cheaper than a single screening of all people individually. For both speed and economy, these order-of-magnitude cost estimates heavily favor WBE over clinical screening for population health assessment. Similarly, about 70% of the US population could be screened for SARS-CoV-2 community spread by analyzing in 48 h all 15,014 wastewater treatment plants at an estimated reagent cost of approximately $225,000 USD. The US currently still has limited clinical testing capacity, rendering individual screening of the 330 million population impractical. In addition, this approach would be too slow and cost-prohibitive, with clinical screening of all Americans leading to reagent costs alone of some $3.5 billion USD per sampling event. Even if the cost of reagents for clinical screening could be reduced by 99% in the future (e.g., through the introduction of paper-based assays) (Mao et al., 2020), the associated costs and logistical challenges still would render this approach questionable and unresponsive to the need of retesting a population to learn about new and repeated infections.",

We estimate that WBE today could reach some 2.1 billion people around the world whose household is connected to one of the approximately 105,600 wastewater treatment plants operated globally. Several nations, including various European countries (SCORE, 2017), Australia (Lai et al., 2018), Israel (Asghar et al., 2014), and China (Feng et al., 2018), already have made strategic investments into WBE at the national level. Whereas the US is home to the largest national and international WBE network and sample repository, the Human Health Observatory (HHO) at Arizona State University, this shared resource (Halden et al., 2019; Venkatesan et al., 2015; Venkatesan and Halden, 2014\nBowes and Halden, 2019) was created over the course of a dozen years primarily with discretionary funds from philanthropists and support from partnering municipalities (Gushgari et al., 2018, Gushgari et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019; Driver et al., 2020). Among the latter, the city of Tempe, AZ stands out as an innovator in WBE data communication, by immediately releasing obtained wastewater data on locally consumed licit and illicit opioids via an online dashboard to inform the public, emergency response teams, and policy makers (ASU-Tempe, 2020).",

Improvements would be welcome in lowering the detection limit and in increasing the precision of quantitative data, possibly achievable via use of digital PCR (Majumdar et al., 2015). Whereas processing of larger sample volumes and more effective concentration of virus particles and viral RNA may help to lower method detection limits, there also is a desire to keep required samples sizes low enough to facilitate economic shipping between sampling location and the analytical laboratory.",

            "text": "This computational modeling study and cost analysis served to identify WBE as a rapid, inexpensive and potentially robust tool for tracking SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Effective use of this emerging surveillance tool will require the consideration of temperature effects in order to obtain robust, informative data. Whereas WBE cannot replace clinical testing, it can serve to alert emergency response teams to the presence of infected individuals in towns, cities and specific drainage areas (sub-sewersheds) of large metropolitan areas down to the neighborhood and building complex level. The feasibility of performing longitudinal monitoring of wastewater at the city-area/neighborhood level already has been demonstrated in the city that served as the use case of this study, Tempe, AZ, where SARS-CoV-2 recently was added to a spectrum of public health indicator that have been tracked continuously since May 2018. To accelerate the global economic recovery, it is desirable to implement restrictions to people's mobility and livelihoods only in locales where these are needed. WBE is well positioned to inform this local decision-making process. WBE also appears to constitute the only viable means of enabling large-scale population-wide testing globally, particularly in resource poor regions. Since effective use of large-scale WBE requires access to wastewater that is centrally collected, composited and treated, the global use of WBE relying on sampling of wastewater treatment plants currently is restricted to about 2.1 billion people or 27% of the global population. Billions of additional people could benefit from human waste analysis by integrating sampling of latrines into global health surveillance. However, he required effort would be disproportionately larger and the number of people reflected in each sample relatively low. Yet, if only 1% of the resources currently allocated for clinical testing were diverted to WBE, significant cost savings could be realized, vulnerable populations could be protected more effectively, and economic recovery could be balanced locally more selectively with the need for containing community spread of the new coronavirus.",
