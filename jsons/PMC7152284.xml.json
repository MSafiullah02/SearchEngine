            "text": "Adenoviruses are large, nonenveloped double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses. Members of three different genera have been described in reptiles: atadenoviruses, siadenoviruses, and the proposed \u201ctestadenoviruses.\u201d6 The atadenoviruses have been hypothesized to have evolved in squamate reptiles,7 and some of the viruses found in these reptiles appear to be host species\u2013specific. Atadenovirus infections in squamates are not always associated with disease, although they may be involved in multipathogen disease processes. There is increasing evidence that numerous squamate atadenoviruses are able to switch between various squamate hosts, with unknown clinical and epidemiologic consequences8 as well as ramifications for viral detection methods. Although atadenoviral infections in squamates are well documented, reports of adenoviral infections in chelonians are relatively rare and the genetic diversity of the detected viruses is relatively high, indicating that at least in some cases adenoviruses have recently switched to chelonians as hosts. The first report of a disease outbreak associated with adenoviral infection in chelonians was in a group of Sulawesi tortoises (Indotestudo forsteni) that were illegally imported into the United States.9 Affected animals developed severe multisystemic disease with clinical signs including anorexia, lethargy, mucosal ulcerations, nasal and ocular discharge, and diarrhea. The group experienced a mortality rate of 82%. An adenovirus was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as by electron microscopy in cells of affected tissues. The virus was determined to belong in the genus Siadenovirus. Siadenoviruses had previously been described in birds but are hypothesized to have evolved in amphibians.10 The same virus was later also found in impressed tortoises (Manouria impressa) and a Burmese star tortoise (Geochelone platynota) with systemic disease.11\n",

TeHV4 was originally detected in a clinically healthy tortoise during quarantine screening.25 TeHV3 has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates than TeHV1.26 Recent studies using molecular techniques to investigate genomic differences between TeHV3 strains as well as transmission studies have provided evidence that there may also be differences in pathogenicity between different isolates.24, 27 In a study in Europe almost 20 years ago in which samples from tortoises kept as pets were tested for the presence of herpesviruses, only TeHV1 and TeHV3 were detected, with TeHV3 making up greater than 80% of the detected herpesviruses.28 In a recent study screening samples from over 1000 chelonians in Europe for herpesviruses and other pathogens, approximately half of the herpesviruses detected were categorized as TeHV1, indicating that the prevalence of this virus in pet tortoises in Europe has increased over the past years, possibly due to changes in the pet trade.3 It might also reflect a change in the popularity of specific tortoise species in the pet trade. During that same study, a TeHV4 was detected for the first time in Europe in an African tortoise species, the leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis).29\n",

They were originally isolated in cell culture and, proving difficult to characterize, were sometimes called \u201cvirus x.\u201d Viruses in this category have been sequenced and shown to represent a new genus in the family Picornaviridae, with the name Torchivirus.37, 38 This group of viruses have been detected mostly in Testudo spp. but also in several African tortoise species. They have been associated with softening of the plastron in juvenile tortoises and with rhinitis, stomatitis, and ascites in adult tortoises. They have also been isolated from clinically healthy animals.28, 39 Transmission studies with T. hermanni and T. graeca showed that the kidneys were most severely affected.40 Serologic testing has shown that some wild-caught tortoises in Europe and Africa have antibodies against these viruses. Epidemiology of these viruses in Europe appears to undergo some fluctuation over time. A recent study showed that torchiviruses were detected by PCR using mostly oral swabs as samples in 2.2% of over 1000 chelonians tested over a Image 1-year period in a commercial laboratory in Europe.3 Another picornavirus with the suggested genus name \u201cRafivirus\u201d was described from Sulawesi tortoises that were also infected with an adenovirus.41 Animals died with severe systemic disease,9 but the role of the picornavirus in the disease is not known.",

A genetically related but distinct virus has been described in shingleback lizards (\u201cbobtails,\u201d Tiliqua rugosa) in Australia.46 In ball pythons, the \u201cBarnivirus\u201d was associated with a proliferative interstitial pneumonia. In some cases, tracheitis, stomatitis, esophagitis, and/or rhinitis were also associated with infection. In individual cases, lesions were also observed in other parts of the body and included encephalitis, acute nephritis, salpingitis, hepatic lipidosis, keratitis, and colitis. The greatest viral load was detected in the lungs of affected snakes.42 A similar disease syndrome of unknown etiology was reported to have been observed in ball pythons since the 1990s.42\n",

Central nervous system (CNS) signs are most often described, but animals may develop anorexia, pneumonia, various skin lesions, mouth rot, and other problems. However, a large number of snakes (especially boa constrictors) may remain clinically healthy despite the presence of inclusions and/or virus. In 2012, NGS showed the probable cause of IBD to be newly discovered viruses in the family Arenaviridae in the new genus Reptarenavirus.49, 50, 51 These viruses are closely associated with the disease and can cause the development of similar inclusions in cell culture. Antibodies against reptarenaviruses isolated in cell culture bind to typical inclusions in the cells of affected animals.49, 50 IBDP is believed to be accumulated viral nucleocapsid protein.49 Additional studies on snakes infected with arenaviruses have demonstrated a huge amount of genetic diversity in these viruses, with multiple species and possibly different genera detected.4, 52 In many cases, snakes were infected with multiple viruses, and the two genomic segments of the reptarenaviruses, L and S, appeared to reassort readily.4 It has been hypothesized that snake importation and husbandry practices may have created this diversity among reptarenaviruses, with capture of wild snakes, importation into various countries, mixing of animals for breeding purposes, and overcrowding all being part of an \u201canthropogenic disruption of pathogen ecology.\u201d4 It has been hypothesized that coinfection or superinfection with multiple reptarenaviruses could play a role in disease development.52\n",
