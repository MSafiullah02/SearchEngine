            "text": "Despite increasing numbers of publications in disaster medicine and MCC during the past 5 years, high-quality research to support evidence-based recommendations for the care of critically ill and injured patients related to a pandemic or disaster is virtually nonexistent and desperately needed. Indeed, this research should be a moral imperative in both resource-rich and resource-poor areas of the world. In the developed world, research should be directed at the provision of critical care during MCC; in resource-poor areas research on building capacity in the current system and on ways to decrease the need for intensive care would be of greater benefit. Granted, significant challenges exist with regard to conducting research in these settings,30 but these challenges can be overcome by \u201cdisruptive creativity\u201d and planning. Conducting research during disasters or pandemics requires novel approaches to address the unique logistic and ethical and methodology challenges of operating and collaborating in these environments. A number of international collaborative efforts, such as those led by the ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium; http://isaric.tghn.org), InFACT31 (International Forum for Acute Care Trialists), and PREEDICCT32 (Providing Resources for Effective and Ethical Decisions in Critical Care Triage) groups serve as examples of the types of efforts required to advance evidence within the field. Research questions that currently need to be addressed are discussed in detail within each of the individual articles within this supplement. In the absence of scientific evidence, experts' opinion, although less than ideal, will have to suffice. Clearly, much research needs to be done to enrich the tacit knowledge of experts.",

Lacking high-quality evidence to guide recommendations, the Task Force has endeavored to bolster the expertise of the Task Force and increase the rigor of the process through which the current expert-opinion-based suggestions were developed. In addition to updating the suggestions, this version of the Task Forces' suggestions addresses the broader issue of caring for the critically ill and injured from pandemics and disasters beyond the walls of the ICU, across the age continuum, and those from special populations who are particularly vulnerable to being negatively impacted and who require specialized critical care. Moreover, the Task Force provides suggestions regarding the evacuation of the critically ill and injured as well as the legal, ethical, and systems frameworks necessary to support an effective response. Finally, the Task Force has attempted to illustrate how the concepts of MCC should be integrated into the spectrum of surge response from contingency care through crisis care.",
