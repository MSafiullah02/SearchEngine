The veal sector is strongly integrated and industrialized and is therefore substantially different from conventional cattle farms (Pardon et al., 2014). Therefore, it cannot be assumed that biosecurity measures and levels of implementation on veal farms are comparable to conventional dairy and beef farms. The veal-rearing system is highly similar throughout the majority of the main veal-producing countries, often with veal companies working across borders (Sans and Fontguyon, 2009). Therefore, biosecurity in Belgian veal farms could, to a certain extent, be considered representative of European veal production.",

The age when leaving the farm of origin differs between countries. In the sorting center, calves are sorted by breed, bodyweight, and conformation, and are thereafter transported to the veal farms (Schoonmaker et al., 2002). White veal calves are slaughtered at a maximum age of 8 months. Most veal calf farms in Belgium are part of a veal company (Pardon et al., 2014). Veal companies organize the veal farming process from the top down, with their own sorting centers, feed factories, and slaughterhouses. The companies generally own the calves, distribute feed to the farms, and impose some management requirements, while the farmer gets paid for each calf he raises on his farm.",

In the list, both calf diseases and diseases of high importance in cattle, or with zoonotic potential, were included. Diseases not occurring in, or not at risk of emergence in Belgium (never reported in Europe), were removed from the initial list. Second, three different data sources were accessed to select the most important diseases from this list: 1) a combination of recently described prioritization methods applied to the literature search, including all notifiable diseases (ANSES, 2010; Havelaar et al., 2010; Humblet et al., 2012; McIntyre et al., 2014; Ciliberti et al., 2015); 2) data on disease occurrences in the last three years, provided by regional animal health centers; and 3) an online survey among bovine veterinary practitioners (Renault et al., 2018a).",

This review was kept as broad as possible to have a complete overview of all factors concerning biosecurity, and then cross-referenced with previous biosecurity questionnaires and a biosecurity reference work (Dewulf and Van Immerseel, 2018). For this reason, a search of the PubMed database was performed with this combination of terms: \u201cname of disease and/or pathogen,\u201d or \u201ccattle,\u201d \u201crisk factors\u201d or \u201cepidemiology\u201d or \u201cprevalence\u201d or \u201cbiosecurity measures\u201d or \u201ccontrol measures.\u201d The list of risk factors and biosecurity measures for each disease was integrated into an exhaustive list with all known (published) risk factors and biosecurity measures relevant for veal calves. If possible, a corresponding biosecurity measure was identified for each risk factor. Risk factors that cannot be controlled, or for which no biosecurity measure is available (e.g., birth weight, weather), as well as risk factors related to parturition or shortly thereafter (e.g., hygiene at parturition and provision of colostrum) were discarded. Though this last category is considered important, these risk factors are outside the control of the veal farmer because the animals arrive at two weeks of age. The total list of biosecurity measures is provided in Annex 1. This table also provides the number of risk factors each measure addresses, and the number of diseases for which it was cited in the literature. In Table 2\n, an overview of the 12 most important biosecurity measures, and their relation to the 34 most important calf diseases is provided.",

This finding confirms previous observations that there is a substantial lack of information on how to improve farm management and how to implement these improvements (Damiaans et al., 2018). The finding also shows that the results of previous studies that suggested measures like risk classification, limitation of the arrival period, and the farms of origin have not been translated into practice (Pardon, 2012).

As the purchase of animals is often described as one of the most important risks in disease introduction (Cuttance and Cuttance, 2014; Sarrazin et al., 2017), this procedure is a significant disadvantage for the veal sector. This disadvantage is even aggravated by the induction of stress through the transport and commingling of the calves, resulting in increased susceptibility to new infections (Stokka, 2010). Solving this calf-sourcing risk will require fundamental changes in the organization of the industry. A first step toward limiting the farms of origin could be grouping births in larger dairy farms to increase the number of calves originating from one farm.",

This decrease is especially important for BVD, as it has been described as one of the major contributors to disease in veal calf-rearing (Pardon et al., 2011). Furthermore, in collaboration with the veal companies, previous experiences with farms of origin could serve as a valuable source of information, provided that this information is recorded and shared (Hobbs, 2004; Pardon, 2012).

Conventional farms often have more types of visitors, such as salesmen, feed suppliers, hoof trimmers and drivers of milk trucks (Renault et al., 2018a). Nevertheless, the frequency with which some visitors enter influences the risk for introduction of disease. Although only a limited number of visitors enter the farm, the precautionary measures they take upon entrance are insufficient (Table 4). As these professional visitors are, by definition, high-risk visitors since they have frequent contact with animals from different farms, the risk of spreading infection through this route remains high.

However, Lava et al. (2016) concluded that farms where calves were vaccinated had a lower mortality rate. Lava and colleagues also remarked that an ideal vaccination scheme should start at the farm of origin, thus reiterating the importance of information exchange between the origin farms and the veal farm. Admittedly, the calves in the study by Lava et al. (2016) were, on average, one month old upon purchase while, in Belgium, calves are sold at the age of two to four weeks (Pardon et al., 2015). Besides vaccination, maternal immunity is of the utmost importance for the calf\u2019s immunity (Delafosse et al., 2015). Measuring serum IgG concentrations of all calves upon arrival, as described by Weaver et al. (2000), could be a measure to ensure the adequate function of the herd\u2019s immune system.",

However, the farmers seem to ignore that the older animals have a higher immune status and can be carriers of quickly spreading, high impact diseases, such as Mycoplasma bovis and Salmonella spp. (Radaelli et al., 2008; Pardon et al., 2011), and therefore can spread disease to the younger animals.

Besides the advantages of keeping young, susceptible calves separated from the older cohorts (Sarrazin et al., 2014), each compartment can be cleaned, disinfected, and thoroughly dried during the sanitary vacancy. A clean and disinfected environment is recommended in the literature for multiple diseases, such as Cryptosporidium parvum, Salmonella spp., and BVD (Daugschies and Najdrowski, 2005; Fossler et al., 2005; Villarroel et al., 2007). Next to the frequency of cleaning and disinfection, a well-designed and adhered-to protocol, including the seven steps described in Van Immerseel et al. (2018), is equally important. These seven steps consist of removal of all organic material, soaking all surfaces, high pressure cleaning, drying, disinfection, drying and testing the efficiency of the procedure. If the stables are not cleaned and disinfected properly, pathogens can survive even after a sufficiently long sanitary vacancy. Research suggests that the length of the sanitary vacancy, which in this study was, on average, ten days, is not as important as a proper cleaning and disinfection procedure (Luyckx et al., 2016). The farmers indicated that they thoroughly cleaned and disinfected their stables more often during recent years due to the distribution of cleaning and disinfection products by the veal company. This example illustrates that the veal company could play a crucial role in the motivation toward the implementation of biosecurity measures. It also illustrates that the farmers are not the sole decision makers and can be influenced regarding their biosecurity policies. Possibly, this understanding explains why several farmers answered that they were not obliged by government or veal company to apply certain measures, but were waiting for guidelines to follow.",
