For example, concentration-dependent transcriptomics approaches with fish models provide efficient tools for prioritizing chemicals of concern and for making management decisions according to the responsiveness of evolutionarily conserved biological pathways in human cells and fish models. 7 High-Throughput In Vitro and In Silico Toxicology In ecotoxicology and environmental toxicology, in vitro methods are now being used for metabolism studies to better elucidate chemical bioaccumulation in fish, an important component of environmental risk assessments for ecosystems and human health (i.e., ingestion of contaminated fish). As the science continues to develop, so has the ability to relate chemical concentrations that induce in vitro responses to in vivo exposure levels resulting in adverse human and ecological outcomes. For example, comparable with in vivo results, 8 toxicogenomic data generated in vitro are already yielding drug rankings and drug potentials to cause toxicity while guiding the selection of appropriate animal species with human relevance. Well-developed in vitro methods are also increasing confidence among scientists and regulators in the resource and ethical advantages of in vitro predictiveness and extrapolation to animals. Further, these methods offer valuable mechanistic information for training and testing a new generation of in silico models that use big data or modeling of molecular interactions to identify problematic chemicals and design less hazardous alternatives. 9 Some of the most active comparative and predictive toxicology efforts in the US include the federal Toxicology in the 21 st Century (Tox21) and Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) programs (http://www. epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicologytesting-21st-century-tox21). Through Tox21 and ToxCast, thousands of chemicals are being screened with hundreds of in vitro assays (largely adapted from drug-development and pre-clinical safety efforts) and zebrafish models for identifying chemical bioactivities. Such highthroughput information is supporting computational efforts to identify chemicals of potential concern. In addition, these and other toxicology advances are being leveraged for prospective evaluations of diverse substances-including ingredients in consumer products, industrial chemicals, and pesticides-for human and ecological hazards and during retrospective assessments (e.g., effectdirected analysis) for the identification of pollutants and other stressors in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

            "text": "One Earth 2, April 24, 2020 313 ll Alternative Vertebrate Models Because of their molecular, biochemical, and physiological similarities to humans, mammals (particularly rodents) have historically been used for biomedical research in general and toxicology in particular. But more recently, various fish species have been increasingly employed as vertebrate alternatives to rodents for toxicology, pharmacology, and etiology studies of human disorders. Notably, approximately ten new drugs discovered by zebrafish screenings have reached, or are about to enter, clinical testing thus far. 10 Fish are now commonly used in laboratory investigations, which are supported by well-developed comparative biology resources. Similar to in vitro tools, fish are more cost and time effective than mammals and aid in reducing animal welfare concerns. The more rapid development and reproduction of fish than of mammals provide clear benefits during high-throughput screening of a large number of chemicals.",

As noted above, recently developed diverse technical resources (such as sequenced genomes, DNA libraries, and available antibodies) further support using fish for biomedical studies. Fully established genome databases of zebrafish and the fathead minnow indicate high evolutionary conservation in comparison with the human genome. For example, 70% of protein-coding human genes are related to genes found in zebrafish, and many mutant phenotypes are similar to human clinical diseases. 11 Evolutionary conservation of pharmacology and toxicology targets for chemicals among species has supported the development of various tools 12 (Box 1) to support the rapid and efficient evaluation of chemical toxicity. For example, Sequence Alignment to Predict across Species Susceptibility (SeqAPASS) 13 is an online tool that supports toxicological predictions across species and the identification of problematic chemicals. Such information can also aid the development and application of new comparative and predictive tools.",

Fortunately, recent developments in comparative biology, computational chemistry, and pharmacology are being translated to provide basic and applied environment and health information to decision makers and practitioners in government agencies and industries, particularly within the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework. 14 AOPs are conceptual models that can be used for understanding chemical activity and potential effects with available knowledge to describe causal linkages from molecular initiating events to adverse outcomes at the individual and population levels, which are relevant to chemical risk assessment. AOPs can also be extended to higher levels of biological organization and for examining cascading interactions among trophic positions. 15 When AOPs are conserved across species, comparative and predictive toxicology efforts promise to further develop coupled ecological and human health hazard and risk assessments.
