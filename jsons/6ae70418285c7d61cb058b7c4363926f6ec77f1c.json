Over time, the film's title has become part of the lexicon to describe the relativity of truth and the unreliability, indeed subjectivity, of memory. Science should be able to provide accurate and reliable explanations. Therefore, emerging reports on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and tear or conjunctival involvement may give readers reason to pause.",

Some authors refer to the report \"Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (5the7th editions),\" updated by the National Health Commission of China on March 4, 2020. An online translation of the seventh edition by a physician society carries the caveat that \"healthcare providers . . . make clinical decisions based on [their] own nation's medical guidelines and regulations.\" \"Suspected\" cases meet 1 of the travel or contact history criteria and 2 of the clinical ones, which include fever, radiographic findings of viral pneumonia, and change in lymphocyte or leukocyte count. \"Confirmed\" cases are \"suspected\" cases with 1 piece of \"etiology or serological evidence: real-time RT-PCR is positive for COVID-19 nucleic acid; the viral gene identified by gene sequencing is . . . homologous with . . . COVID-19,\" or immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G presence with immunoglobulin G titer increase in recovery.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 6 human coronavirus NL63, and other viruses (e.g., adenovirus) provide examples of ocular tropism of respiratory viruses. Possible reasons include anatomic linkage, structure and distribution of cellular receptors, and immunologic interdependence. 7 Experiments strongly suggest that the eye is a potential entry portal for these viruses and emphasize the importance of masking and eye protection for ophthalmologists, 8 who sit far closer to patients than the 6 feet recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for social distancing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 may end up in tears and conjunctiva because of such direct inoculation, migration of an upper respiratory tract infection, or hematogenous involvement of the lacrimal gland. However, further study is needed to determine whether the viral load in tears or conjunctiva is enough to transmit infection.",

The coronavirus pandemic has exposed geopolitical differences in preparation and approach to COVID-19: screening, contact tracing, self-quarantine, masking, and providing personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael described Rashomon as the \"classic film statement of the relativism, the unknowability of truth.\" Other viewers have insisted there must be 1 true account of the crime, discoverable if one diligently sifts through the clues. Two truths may emerge here: the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular tissue or secretions would not be surprising, and ophthalmologists are at increased risk for infection without adequate protection.",
