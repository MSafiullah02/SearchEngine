PCR is a powerful new technique developed in 1985 and is an alternative to direct hybridization methods. It can be used to amplify a small piece of viral DNA or RNA in clinical specimens up to a millionfold, allowing detection of small quantities of infectious agent in a single sample. PCR has the sensitivity to detect as few as ten infected cells or one virus in as many as one million cells in clinical specimens. Because PCR is very sensitive, slight contamination of laboratory specimens by stray DNA can lead to amplification of DNA not in the original specimen. It is being used currently to detect HIV, herpesviruses, influenza virus, hepatitis viruses, rotavirus, EBV, CMV, and parvovirus. The use of PCR for the diagnosis of CNS disease has been well evaluated for HSV encephalitis and enterovirus meningitis. The use of this highly sensitive technique has increased our understanding of the etiological role of viruses in CNS disease. For example, it has been demonstrated that varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and HSV type 2 (HSV-2) can cause meningitic symptoms without causing concurrent skin lesions.",

Besides providing prognostic information on individual cases, particularly for HIV and human CMV, genome quantification plays a most important role in monitoring the patient\u2019s response to antiviral treatment. VL testing assesses the success of antiviral therapy, including, but unable to distinguish between, different factors involved. These include treatment failure due to viral (development of antiviral resistance) and host factors (one of which is noncompliance). Several studies have proven the value of VL determination as a surrogate marker for clinical markers of therapeutic success. The increasing availability and clinical use of potent anti-(retro)viral chemotherapy has sparked the development of a variety of commercial assays for viral genome quantification.
