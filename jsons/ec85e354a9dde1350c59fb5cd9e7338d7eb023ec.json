EOSINOPHIL RESPONSE IN COVID-19 162 RV, RSV, and IFV are common triggers of viral-induced asthma exacerbations, whereas 163 coronaviruses are far less common triggers for acute asthma exacerbations. 29, 38-41 Asthma has 164 not yet been identified as a major risk factor for severity of SARS-CoV-1 infections. 42 With 165 regard to SARS-CoV-2, Zhang et al. recently reported that none of the 140 hospitalized patients 166 with confirmed COVID-19 in one hospital in Wuhan, China reported asthma or comorbid atopic 167 disease. 10 Another recent review of 548 patients admitted with COVID-19 to another hospital in 168 Wuhan reported only five cases of asthma (prevalence of 0.9%), markedly lower than the 169 prevalence of asthma within the adult population in Wuhan (6.4%). 43 Leukocytosis, with 170 increased absolute neutrophil counts, has been associated with more severe presentations of 171 COVID-19 disease. 43-46 Interestingly, Zhang et al. reported more than half of the patients 172 admitted with COVID-19 (53%) had eosinopenia (defined as absolute eosinophil counts <0.02 173 x10 9 cells/L) on the day of hospital admission. 10 Similarly, Du et al. reviewed the medical 174 records of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 and noted that 81% of the patients had absolute 175 eosinophil counts below the normal range (absolute eosinophil counts <0.02 x10 9 cells/L) at the 176 time of admission. 47 Lymphopenia has also been a common finding in patients with COVID-177 19, 10, 43, 48, 49 and blood eosinophil counts correlated positively with lymphocytes counts in both 178 severe and non-severe cases. 10 Liu et al. also noted eosinopenia at the time of initial presentation 179 in a small cohort of patients that were treated with lopinavir. 50 Notably, eosinophil levels 180 improved in all patients prior to discharge, suggesting that resolution of eosinopenia may be an 181 indicator of improving clinical status. The pathophysiology for eosinopenia in COVID-19 182 remains unclear but is likely multifactorial, involving inhibition of eosinophil egress from the 183 bone marrow, blockade of eosinophilopoiesis, reduced expression of chemokine 184 receptors/adhesion factors 8, 51 and/or direct eosinophil apoptosis induced by type 1 interferons 185 released during the acute infection. 52 Importantly, no eosinophil enrichment into the pulmonary 186 tissue has been observed in samples from patients with COVID-19 disease at early stages of 187 disease 53 or in postmortem analyses. 54 Moreover, postmortem analysis of lung tissue from a 188 patient who died from COVID-19 demonstrated signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome that 189 was dominated by mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, mostly lymphocytes. 55 Consequently, 190 consistent with SARS-CoV-1, asthma or other allergic comorbidities do not seem to increase risk 191 for poor outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infections given the current evidence available. 192",

VACCINE-INDUCED IMMUNOPATHOLOGY LINKED TO CORONAVIRUSES 203 Following the outbreak of the SARS epidemic in late 2002, investigators raced to develop 204 candidate SARS-CoV-1 vaccines. Diverse strategies were tested, including use of attenuated or 205 inactivated whole CoV particles, DNA-based vaccines, recombinant viral particles, and 206 recombinant subunit vaccines. 57 Sera from patients convalescing from SARS revealed robust 207 antibody titers against the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein. 58 Vaccine candidates that 208 induced neutralizing antibodies targeting the S protein demonstrated efficacy in blocking viral 209 replication, 59 a concept later confirmed by passive antibody transfer studies. 60, 61 Unfortunately, 210 anti-SARS vaccine-associated pathology emerged in early ferret (hepatitis 62 and pulmonary 211 eosinophilia 62, 63 ), cynomolgus monkey (Th2-type immunopathology with eosinophils 63, 64 ), and 212 mouse (pulmonary eosinophilia) 65 studies. SARS-CoV-1 driven, eosinophil-associated Th2 213 immunopotentiation also occurred with reinfection (green monkey model), suggesting that 214 immune enhancement of coronavirus-associated disease may be relevant in future outbreaks of 215 heterologous CoVs. 66 Eosinophil-associated disease enhancement following exposure after 216 vaccination is unfortunately not a new phenomenon. Historical reports from the 1960s link 217 administration of a candidate formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine to severe, eosinophil-associated 218 pulmonary disease following natural infection.

Two 227 independent studies using recombinant viral particles (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus 228 [VEEV] or Vaccinia) utilized isolated SARS structural proteins to investigate the source of 229 immunopathology. 65, 71 N-protein vaccination was implicated as a major driver of vaccine-230 associated pulmonary eosinophilia, although passive transfer of anti-N protein antibody was not 231 sufficient to drive enhanced Th2 disease, suggesting a possible role for anti-N protein-specific T 232 cells. 65 Th2-mediated disease enhancement was also linked to age, as vaccination of aged mice 233 (>12 months old) with double-inactivated SARS-CoV-1 led to increased morbidity/mortality and 234 accentuated eosinophilic pulmonary disease. 72 Follow-up studies comparing vaccination 235 strategies, vaccine preparations [whole virus/virus-like particles vs. subunits vs. subunit 236 fragments], boosting strategies and timing, and the inclusion of alum versus other adjuvants 237 (TLR agonists) have yielded variable results. In early studies, chimeric recombinant virus-like 238 particle vaccines displaying only the SARS S protein did not induce eosinophilia. 65, 71 In 239 contrast, isolated S protein subunit vaccines (Spike \u0394TM [S \u0394TM ]) appeared capable of Th2 240 immunopotentiation. 63, 73, 74 S protein-derived fragments containing just the receptor-binding 241 domain (RBD) have also been proposed as vaccine antigens, but these vaccine formulations have 242 required more aggressive use of adjuvants and more boosters (3-4 times more) than other 243 approaches. 57 Investigations into the Th2 immunopotentiation capacity of these compounds have 244 been limited but reassuring, with one study showing no evidence of pulmonary eosinophilia in 245 post-challenge animals 75 and a follow-up study showing balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine induction 246 following vaccination. 76 Some investigators have implicated the inclusion of the Th2-skewing 247 adjuvant alum in causing the immunopotentiation, and subsequent studies have shown that the 248 inclusion of Th1-skewing adjuvants with both whole virus and subunit vaccine candidates have 249 attenuated or blocked the development of pulmonary eosinophilia with SARS-CoV-1 250 challenge. 73, 74 Alternatively, contaminating exogenous proteins from serum-containing media 251 (i.e., bovine serum albumin) in vaccine preparation or viral stocks may explain the observed Th2 252 skewing in certain experiments; however, the absence of eosinophilic infiltrates in mock-253 vaccinated control animals makes this possibility less likely. Overall, the SARS-CoV-1 254 vaccination literature documents recurrent, post-vaccination disease enhancement in diverse 255 vaccine preparations and across multiple animal models; however, this side effect declines with 256 the use of more tightly defined antigens (S protein RBD peptide) and the use of Th1 skewing 257 adjuvants. 258 259",
