Reinfection with HRSV can occur throughout life, and annual epidemics occur during winter months in temperate regions. 3 HRSV (Family: Paramyxoviridae, Ordo: Mononegavirales) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, negative sense, nonsegmented RNA genome that is 15.2 kb in length. The viral genome consists of 10 genes, coding for 11 proteins in the following order: NS1, NS2, N, P, M, SH, G, F, M2-1, M2-2, and L. Two groups, HRSVA and HRSVB, have been described based on reactions with monoclonal antibodies against the G and F glycoproteins. 4, 5 The G protein is a type-II integral membrane protein consisting of 289-299 amino acids that facilitates virus attachment to a susceptible cell host. The ectodomain of the G protein consists of two hypervariable regions, HVR1 and HVR2, that are split by a highly conserved 13-amino acid length (aa 155-206) domain. The addition of O-and N-oligosaccharides to G glycoprotein changes its antigenic characteristics. 1,4,6-8 HVR2 region, located at the C-terminal end of protein, commonly used for molecular analyses.

Insertion in the same place was determined by Cui et al13 in CB1 strains. The association of changes in the G protein length with antigenic variation has been reported in many studies. The antibody response induced by HRSVA may provide cross protection against HRSVB such that HRSVB undergoes more extensive antigenic variation to evade herd immunity.2,47 Some recently reported novel variants, such as BAC and CB-A within HRSV subgroups, seem to be circulating domestically. 11,13 TR-A, TR-BA1, and TR-BA2 should also remain domestically. As proposed by Reiche and Schweiger,35 these results indicate that HRSV strains may develop independently. It should be monitored whether these novel genotypes were temporary or will establish a stable linage in the population. Additionally, it is important to follow-up on the mutations that the virus developed against herd immunity.Diversity in the HVR2 region of the G protein plays a significant role in HRSV pathogenesis by facilitating evasion of the immune response.8,48 Our results indicate that the ectodomain G protein of HRSV has both N-linked and O-linked glycosylation with O-linked sugars contributing to the major part of glycosylation.2,7,11", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Clinical symptoms and characteristics observed for HRSVA and B from the patients at the Pediatric Allergy and Immunology Clinic, Department of Children's Health Pediatric Hematology Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Ankara", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>HRSVA (n = 45)\n</td><td>HRSVB\n(n = 24) </td><td>P\n</td></tr><tr><td>Age, month </td><td>5.6 (2.3-10.6) </td><td>2.8 (1.8-9.6) </td><td>0.20\n</td></tr><tr><td>Male gender, n (%) </td><td>27 (60.0) </td><td>13 (54.2) </td><td>0.64\n</td></tr><tr><td>Premature birth, n (%) </td><td>6 (13.3) </td><td>6 (25.0) </td><td>0.19\n</td></tr><tr><td>Clinical symptoms, n (%)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Fever </td><td>17 (37.8) </td><td>7 (29.2) </td><td>0.42\n</td></tr><tr><td>Coughing </td><td>44 (97.8) </td><td>24 (100) </td><td>0.65\n</td></tr><tr><td>Wheezing </td><td>35 (77.8) </td><td>18 (75.0) </td><td>0.79\n</td></tr><tr><td>Rhinorrhea </td><td>17 (37.8) </td><td>11 (45.8) </td><td>0.61\n</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment, n (%)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Oxygen </td><td>37 (82.2) </td><td>21 (87.5) </td><td>0.42\n</td></tr><tr><td>Antibiotics </td><td>36 (80.0) </td><td>21 (87.5) </td><td>0.33\n</td></tr><tr><td>Systemic steroid </td><td>23 (51.1) </td><td>15 (62.5) </td><td>0.36\n</td></tr><tr><td>Salbutamol </td><td>44 (97.8) </td><td>21 (87.5) </td><td>0.11\n</td></tr><tr><td>Duration of response to treatment, day\n</td><td>5 (3.75-6.0) </td><td>5 (5.0-8.0) </td><td>0.1\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Length of hospitalization,\n</td><td>9 (7.0-9.0) </td><td>8 (7.0-11.0) </td><td>0.65\n</td></tr><tr><td>day*\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Laboratory findings, n (%)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Leukocytosis </td><td>5 (11.1) </td><td>1 (4.2) </td><td>0.33\n</td></tr><tr><td>Eosinophilia </td><td>1 (2.2) </td><td>1 (4.2) </td><td>0.59\n</td></tr><tr><td>CRP </td><td>17 (37.8) </td><td>12 (50.0) </td><td>0.25\n</td></tr><tr><td>Pathological findings in chest X-ray\n</td><td>29 (64.4) </td><td>20 (83.3) </td><td>0.062\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Additional Supporting Information may be found online in the supporting information tab for this article.
