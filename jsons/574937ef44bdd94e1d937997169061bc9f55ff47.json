            "text": "Following the first report of coronavirus disease 2019 in Sapporo City, Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan on 14 February 2020, a surge of cases was observed in Hokkaido during February and March. As of 6 March, 90 cases were diagnosed in Hokkaido. Unfortunately, many infected persons may not have been recognized as cases due to having mild or no symptoms. We therefore estimated the actual number of COVID-19 cases in (i) Hokkaido Prefecture and (ii) Sapporo City using data on cases diagnosed outside these areas. The estimated cumulative incidence in Hokkaido as of 27 February was 2297 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 382, 7091) based on data on travelers outbound from Hokkaido. The cumulative incidence in Sapporo City as of 28 February was estimated at 2233 cases (95% CI: 0, 4893) based on the count of confirmed cases within Hokkaido. Both approaches resulted in similar estimates, indicating higher incidence of infections in Hokkaido than were detected by the surveillance system. This quantification of the gap between detected and estimated cases can help inform public health response as it provides insight into the possible scope of undetected transmission.",

The internationally exported cases were reported from Malaysia (1 case) and Thailand (2 cases) [29, 30] . Considering that the two Thailand cases are husband and wife and one case is asymptomatic, one infection may have been the result of household transmission as similarly described in [31] rather than exported from Japan. Second, the total volume of air passengers from all airports in Hokkaido to Thailand and Malaysia over the two-month period of January and February 2019 were retrieved from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and includes 9,349 passengers to Malaysia and 45,137 to Thailand.

For example, in one instance a Sapporo resident travelled to Kitami City in Okhotsk subprefecture and caused secondary infections among Kitami residents. These Kitami residents were excluded from our analysis as they were infected outside of Sapporo. However, if a case from Kitami was to travel to Sapporo, have likely been infected there, and then be subsequently diagnosed in Kitami, they would eligible for our analysis.

By subtracting the daytime population size from the nighttime population size and dividing the difference by the nighttime population, we obtained a value of 3.7% [33] , reflecting the change in population size of Sapporo due to commuting. However, this estimate accounts for movement of individuals both within Ishikari subprefecture and between subprefectures. In contrast, our model requires the average estimate between all subprefectures of Hokkaido. Therefore, we set this parameter at 1% and performed a sensitivity analysis wherein we varied the fraction of commuters between 0.5% and 4%.",

A surge of cases was observed at the end of February (Figure 2A ). In the first half of February, peaks of reported cases by date of illness onset were separated by 3-4 days on average, consistent with estimates of the serial interval [45] . The epidemic curve peaked around 18 February 2020, but the decline in cases which was seen later can be explained by the delay in reporting. The delay distribution fitted with the gamma distribution had the mean of 7.9 days (95% CI: 6.9, 9.0) and standard deviation of 4.2 days (95% CI: 3.3, 5.2).

            "text": "In our analysis of the reporting delay, we did not implement right truncation of the likelihood because the low case count (by date of illness onset) seen in late February through the beginning of March was likely due to the effect of interventions in Hokkaido rather than delays in reporting. In support of this assumption, there were fewer cases reported between 28 February and 6 March compared to the week of 21-27 February (cf. Figure 2 and Supplementary figure 2) . Right truncation should therefore be used with caution when it is unclear whether recent incidence is increasing or decreasing. Although we tracked the spread of the disease in Hokkaido and we were able to distinguish between locally acquired and travel associated infections, the surveillance systems in the subprefectures of Hokkaido may not be sensitive enough to detect cases with milder symptoms. This could explain why we obtained a lower estimate of the incidence in Sapporo using cases diagnosed within Hokkaido compared to analyzing the outbound flow of travelers from Hokkaido. Use of data on travel volume of commuters and tourists within Hokkaido could be beneficial for fitting the travel volume to the observed incidence rather than adopting a model of human movement ( Figure 3B ). However, publicly available data on train, bus, and private car travel in Hokkaido were inconsistent and scarce, and we were unable to use them for this study. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that the use of mathematical models of human movement at the scale of estimating the travel volume between administrative subunits of a given region is a promising alternative to use of observed transportation data. Previously, this has been also demonstrated by other researchers in assessing the risk of spread of yellow fever in Angola [23] or during epidemics in resource poor settings [24] .",

As shown by other researchers [39, 48] the linear regression fit of the travel volume among international travelers to observed disease incidence represents an elegant way to distinguish areas that are able to well detect new infections from those that are likely to miss some fraction of cases. We applied the same approach to compare the performance of the various subprefectures of Hokkaido, as shown in Figure 3B . Subprefectures that fall within the 95% CI of the linear regression line are considered to have surveillance systems that succeed in detecting COVID-19 infections within their jurisdiction. Subprefectures that fall below the 95% CI of the linear regression line may not have surveillance systems that are sensitive enough to detect all imported cases [39] .

However, Shirebeshi is located next to Ishikari/Sapporo and includes the relatively large city of Otaru, though the lack of reports in Shiribeshi may be explained by our use of place of diagnosis over place of residence for determining the subprefecture assigned to cases. This was done because the specific place of residence was not always reported. We suspect that some cases from Shirebeshi subprefecture were diagnosed in Ishikari subprefecture.",

(A) shows international and domestic cases (excluding Hokkaido). Hokkaido is shaded in black, whereas affected countries are depicted in red. The circled numbers indicate the total count of cases for each import destination. (B) shows all cases confirmed in Hokkaido. The labels indicate the names of the subprefectures of Hokkaido. (C) shows only cases included in our analysis: non-residents of Sapporo with unknown links either with or without travel history to Sapporo. Ishikari subprefecture was separated into two subregions: Sapporo City and outside Sapporo City. Hatched areas in grey indicate subprefectures with zero counts. Epidemic curves by date of report (A) and date of illness onset (B) as of 29 February 2020 for confirmed cases among Japanese nationals that were linked to Hokkaido. The total number of cases are characterized according to the legend shown in (A).",
