Indeed, daily weights and fluid balance help guide diuretic and fluid therapy. However, the inflammatory state in COVID-19 patients may contribute to vascular permeability and intravascular depletion despite increased total body water. Periodic vasoplegia, high positive end-expiratory pressure, and cardiac dysfunction also confuse typical hemodynamic estimations of total body water such as blood pressure and central venous pressure. 4 Utilizing an apical four-chamber view and a parasternal short-axis view, a quick estimation of left and right ventricular function and fluid status can be obtained (Figure 1 ). These findings could then be interpreted in the context of hemodynamics and fluid balance to guide treatment.",

In addition to ventilatory settings, partial pressure of oxygen, and pulse oximetry, a scoring of diseased to normal lung regions may add to patient assessment. Placing patients with severe ARDS in the prone position is employed as high settings or limits of mechanical ventilation are reached. 5 Posterior lung ultrasound, if identifying significant areas of normal lung parenchyma, may identify patients in whom early proning may reduce precipitous increases in ventilator settings, 3 escalation of vasopressors, and need for neuromuscular paralysis. We depict a COVID-19 patient pre-and post-proning demonstrating improved lung aeration and reduced consolidation (Figure 2 ).",
