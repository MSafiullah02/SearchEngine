Because of the low number of COVID-19 test kits available at the hospital and which are reserved for patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 infection, each patient admitted to the orthopedic department and the operating room is considered like COVID-19 positive even if they are otherwise healthy adults with no comorbidities. Surgeons must ensure utmost care is provided to patients in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative settings to minimize risks of infection [4, 7, 8] . Personnel entering operating theatre must be reduced [9] . All traffic in and out of the operating theater should be minimized [6] . Intraoperatively, full personal protection equipment including N95 FFP2 masks, protective glasses and face shields should be used even if it reduces the clarity of verbal communication between theatre staff [10] . Consideration should be given to surgical approaches that could decrease operating staff exposure and shorten case duration [6] . Surgical team should be kept to the minimum, whenever possible [3, 4, 11] . In our department, we deplore the absence of N95 masks supplied to our staff. We only benefit from simple surgical masks to operate on patients during this pandemic. Surgical face masks are not designed for personnel protection and do not closely fit around the face and mouth. Their design is intended for preventing contamination of the surgical wound from the aerosols generating by the surgical team [9] . We have received face shields made and supplied by generous donors.",

This includes the adoption of telemedicine initiatives, allowing patients to be consulted and followed-up in the comfort of their own homes [4, 11, [13] [14] [15] . Where possible, consultations are done through the telephone and this helps to allay patients' anxiety [3] .

Physical and social distancing must be respected between health workers and patients. With the increased number of COVID-19 cases in the hospital, the intensive care and pulmonology units were quickly saturated. To align with other hospital departments, a COVID19 unit has been set up in the orthopedic surgery department to receive COVID-19 positive patients. There is a single entrance in this unit and dedicated nursing staff to avoid contact with the rest of patients admitted for orthopedic conditions. The COVID-19 crisis has resulted in people working outside their specialty [1] . The orthopedic community has banded with their medical and surgical colleagues in the battle against COVID-19 [4] . During this COVID-19 crisis, orthopedic surgeons and residents, together with their counterparts from other specialties, have been requisitioned for shifts in the special COVID-19 ward at the emergency department to assist with the screening of suspected cases [4] . The COVID-19 shifts were planned to involve all the medical and surgical departments of the Mustapha Bacha hospital. Our team was composed of 2 senior surgeons and 2 junior surgeons (residents) with a rotation system to involve all the surgeons and residents of the orthopedic surgery department. Any plans need to be developed with a recognition that the severity of the situation and the availability of resources may change on a daily basis [6] .

Authors should declare the role of study sponsors, if any, in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data; in the writing of the manuscript; and in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. If the study sponsors had no such involvement, the authors should so state.Authors must obtain written and signed consent to publish a case report from the patient (or, where applicable, the patient's guardian or next of kin) prior to submission. We ask Authors to confirm as part of the submission process that such consent has been obtained, and the manuscript must include a statement to this effect in a consent section at the end of the manuscript, as follows: \"Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal on request\".Patients have a right to privacy. Patients' and volunteers' names, initials, or hospital numbers should not be used. Images of patients or volunteers should not be used unless the information is essential for scientific purposes and explicit permission has been given as part of the consent. If such consent is made subject to any conditions, the Editor in Chief must be made aware of all such conditions.Even where consent has been given, identifying details should be omitted if they are not essential. If identifying characteristics are altered to protect anonymity, such as in genetic pedigrees, authors should provide assurance that alterations do not distort scientific meaning and editors should so note.",
