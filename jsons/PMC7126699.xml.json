Thus, travel and tourism play important roles in the economic development of some nations, such as Fiji (Aresh, Umar, & Aryan, 2004; Eilat & Einav, 2004). Fiji, one of the nations in the Pacific region, is a typical tourism nation for tourists from Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada, the UK, and Japan. The national income for Fiji is not as large as that of other nations. Thus, revenue from tourism is relatively more important than it is for other nations. The tourism revenue for Fiji reached 22% of its GDP in 1998 (Eilat & Einav, 2004). Similarly, tourism revenue accounted for approximately 32% of total government revenue in 2017 for the Maldives (Statistics & Research Section, Ministry of Tourism, Maldives, 2018). In 2008, the World Tourism Organization of the United Nations (henceforth UNWTO) predicted that the total number of tourists will reach 1.561 billion by 2020 and that tourism will be one of the major sources of revenue for developing nations (UNWTO (2017)). Data by UNWTO (2018a) also indicate that tourism in Asia and the Pacific region contributes 25% of the total tourism revenues of all nations.",

The TTCI is a comprehensive index to calculate each nation's travel and tourism competitiveness. Because the TTCI is a composite index, it is difficult to identify the performance of any specific factor of a sub-index or certain category of the index for a specific nation (Hanafiah & Hemdi, 2016; Joshi, Poudyal, & Larson, 2017; Weaver, Kwek, & Wang, 2017). Thus, if a certain factor is prominent or important, it must be calculated individually. Studies by Song and Li (2008) have determined the influence of the relative commodity price level on travel and tourism. Other studies have indicated that factors such as the security of the travelling spot, gourmet food, and scenic views are crucial for tourism decisions (C\u00eerstea, 2014; Enright & Newton, 2004).",

Tourism increases revenues for destination nations. Durbarry and Sinclair (2003) studied tourism demand in France and concluded that Italy, Spain, and Great Britain (henceforth GB) accounted for 60% of outbound tourists to France. Their study further indicated that from 1996 to 2000, the number of tourists to GB decreased by 16%, and tourism revenue for the nation decreased by 9%. In contrast, the number of tourists to Italy and Spain increased by 26% and 19%, respectively, and their tourism revenue increased by 14% and 22%, respectively. This evidence not only shows the consistent change between the number of inbound tourists and the amount of tourism revenue but also demonstrates tourism competition among nations. Thus, each nation uses different ways to attract tourists (Harb & Bassil, 2018; Kozak, Kim, & Chon, 2017; Mar\u00e1kov\u00e1, Dyr, & Tuzimek, 2016; UNWTO, 2017).",

This situation reversed in 2016, when the number of tourists from China decreased dramatically from its highest level of 4.2 million in 2015 to 3.5 million in 2016 and further decreased to 2.7 million in 2017. The reason for this significant variation was the implementation of China's Open-door Tourism Policy to Taiwan (hereafter Open-door Policy) in 2008. In 2008, the number of tourists allowed to visit Taiwan was relaxed, but it was tightened in 2016 when the ruling party of the central government in Taiwan changed. Thus, this policy has highly political connotations. It is quite different from regular tourism policies that are designed to limit or attract tourists based on tourists' personal qualifications.",

It is generally believed that an increase in the number of tourists will create more employment opportunities in the travel industry, generate more revenue from the tourism sector, and provide frequent cultural exchanges among nations (Ap & Crompton, 1998; Kwek & Lee; Omkar, Poudyal, & Larson, 2017). However, these positive impacts may not occur if the number of inbound tourists is less than that stipulated by policies implemented by other nations. That is, if there is a tremendous increase in the number of inbound tourists or a large number of tourists pour into Taiwan and tourism revenue increases due to the Open-door Policy, a decline could occur in the number of tourists and tourism revenues. The changes in the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan stated above from 2008 to 2015 and to 2017 are obvious evidence.",

However, when the implementation of such a policy is imposed by other nations, it affects the nature of tourism as an action of free movement. For tourists, the selection of destinations is not a free choice but should be approved by home nations. For destination nations, this causes the potential number of inbound tourists and potential tourism revenue to become highly uncertain. As such, improvement in any facility or other factor might not be useful for engaging inbound tourists. This uncertainty could make tourism either change or remain the same for destination nations. For instance, tourists and the associated tourism revenues from other nations might decline due to an increase in the number of tourists from China. Specifically, if the number of inbound tourists declines, this will reduce travel expenditures, and the overall tourism revenue in Taiwan will decrease. However, this pessimistic situation may not occur. An increase in the number of tourists from China might attract more tourists from other nations.",

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the change in the number of tourists to Taiwan and tourism revenue under the Open-door Policy. The innovation of this study is that a policy factor imposed by a nation other than Taiwan is included in the EGM. This factor means that the number of tourists to Taiwan is basically controlled by other nations. The analysis in this study not only empirically allows us to identify the impact of a particular factor in the EGM but also scientifically provides deeper insight into tourism management in the EGM. The simulation for 2018\u20132021 observes the sustained impact in the number of tourists visiting Taiwan and the change in tourism revenue for different nations under this policy.",

The estimation of the EGM can determine factors that influence international trade, and the model can be applied to tourism. Park and Jang (2014) used the EGM to analyse 30 nations from 1995 to 2009 and found that the major factors were not only the GDP, population, and distance but also natural and cultural resources, infrastructure for tourism, price competitiveness, and political and policy factors (e.g., the process of applying for a visa). Certain types of infrastructure, such as public transportation, have been included in the gravity model (e.g., Khadaroo and Seetanah's study, 2008) to study their effect on tourists. Moreover, both economic and non-economic factors affect tourism. Vietze (2012) noted that a common culture, such as the same or a similar language, was a decisive factor for the selection of visiting nations.

A similar comparison can be conducted for tourism revenue and its corresponding share to total tourism revenue in the same year for the nations and regions. We find that the actual total number of tourists from China decreases rapidly from its highest point in 2015\u20132017 (the year for which the most recent data are available) by approximately 35%. If the number of tourists from China continues to decline (as the simulated results indicate it will), the share of tourists from China will decrease to 9% by 2021. The corresponding tourism revenue will then drop from 49% of total tourism revenue in Taiwan in 2015 to 11% in 2021. However, this decline will decrease the number of tourists travelling to Taiwan from some nations and regions but will increase the number of tourists from South Korea and many nations from South and Southeast Asia.

This policy promoted a large number of tourists to Taiwan. It is important to identify the impact of this policy when operated in opposite directions by China.

It seems optimistic to have a larger number of tourists from the other nations when there are more tourists from China under its Open-door Policy to Taiwan. However, Taiwan will inevitably be faced with fewer tourists from all other nations (i.e., Japan, Hong Kong, Australasia (New Zealand and Australia), North America (Canada and the US), and Europe (France, Germany, GB, Italy, and the Netherlands)) as China reduces its number of tourists.

The results clearly indicate that Taiwan must identify the reason for the increase in tourists from all other nations. To minimize the impact of China's Open-door Policy on the number of tourists from all other nations (regions), the best strategy for Taiwan is to promote different factors to attract tourists from nations other than China. If the current preparation and arrangement of travel and tourism facilities is specifically designed or developed for China due to its large number of inbound tourists, then other nations have the opportunity to use them only incidentally. This makes other nations a spillover beneficiary of travel to Taiwan. This is not an effective way of developing the tourism industry for Taiwan in the long term. Because inbound tourists from different nations have different preferences and tastes for tourism facilities and installations, such as hotels, motels, and public transportation, the preparation of different types of hardware and software facilities suitable for tourists from different nations around the world is essential. Relying on a policy imposed by other nations to bring Taiwan an abundant number of tourists is an unwise and passive decision. The development and improvement of travel and tourism facilities for tourists from different nations is a constructive way to produce a competitive relationship for the number of tourists and tourism revenue between China and other nations.",

First, the distance between the capital of Taiwan and that of a specific country is a proxy variable of travel cost and is constant over time; thus, the model used here, like most other gravity model applications, cannot take into account the effect of travel cost variation for travel and tourism to different destinations. If data for flight routes to different destinations are available, the travel costs from the gasoline use of aircrafts travelling at different times to different nations might replace the current constant distance variable between the capitals of nations. If this is possible, the creation of this variable requires high demands for data. Second, the estimated coefficients of variables in the conventional gravity model only present the mean effects for tourist numbers and fail to capture out-of-average differentiations. An advanced method, such as quantile regression, is a possible solution to this problem and could be used in future research.",
