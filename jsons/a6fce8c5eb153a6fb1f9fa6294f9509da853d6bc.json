[2] In some viruses, statin-induced reduction of cholesterol in the plasma membrane results in lower viral titres and failure to internalize the virus. Such data suggest that in some viruses, cholesterol affects the early stages of infection. In particular, in the initial stage of infection, viruses bind specific receptors concentrated within lipid rafts, areas of plasma membrane rich in cholesterol. Statins, by reducing the percentage of cholesterol present in the membrane, alter the assembly of the receptors and dramatically reduce the possibility of adhesion of the viral agent to the host. Lipid rafts are also involved in the viral replication phases, as they constitute packets of vesicles capable of concentrating virus replication factors. These processes are also highly destabilized by statins. [2] Many viral pathogens encode substrates for mammalian prenylation pathway (mevalonate pathway). It is hypothesized that the pre-dilation of viral proteins is beneficial for the propagation of the virus and that in some viral infections the statins, by inhibiting HMG-CoAR and reducing the expression of prenylated proteins, carry out an evident antiviral activity. [2] A recent study has shown that the influenza A virus induces the formation of numerous lipid droplets in infected cells. In the experimental model used, Madin-Darby dog kidney cells were treated with atorvastatin (ATV, 5microM) before inducing the infection. Pretreatment reduced the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infectious capacity and, consequently, the production of new influenza A viruses, with a percentage higher than 95%. [4] Studies performed in other viral strains have shown that different statins perform antiviral activity with variable efficacy, probably due to the specific pharmacological and biochemical properties of the statins used in the analysis and, therefore, to the different antiviral power observed. [5] Furthermore besides statins there are also a series of mevalonate pathway inhibitors that could then be used in the next future with a more specific target and effectiveness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 137, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 945, "end": 948, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1316, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1748, "end": 1751, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2048, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 131, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "It is certainly worth studying in detail the mechanism by which statins inhibit virus replication.
