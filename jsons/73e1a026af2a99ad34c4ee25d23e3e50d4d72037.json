During the Cold War, when adversarial great-powers and their supporting blocs appeared to be perennially poised on the brink of catastrophic conflict, realism gained ground among national security establishments ruling dominant states. Grounded in the postulate that its practitioners perceived the world as it really was, an agglomeration of selfish Westphalian state-actors pursuing narrow self-aggrandising interests, without a central authority to moderate such Hobbesian tendencies, a world where the strong did what they wished and the weak did what they could to defend themselves, realist frameworks rationalised, if they did not breed, competitive policies.",

Pursuing a Kantian perspective of collaborative approaches to shared challenges and opportunities, they pushed a collegial line as an organising principle in both domestic politics and international relations. For much of the period, liberalism was largely associated with scholastic visionaries seeking to challenge practitioners with alternative concepts of the possibilities of managing interstate relations. However, even many leaders of post-colonial successor-states who refused openly to align themselves to either bloc of realism-driven competitors, preferring instead to form a non-aligned coalition, mixed liberal rhetoric with realist praxis.",

At its heart reposed the dominant system, a constellation of the world's great powers, inheriting their leading status from their victory in World War II. The dominant system itself radiated outward from the systemic core, a bipolar-binary construct comprising two adversarial superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, located at the peak of the global power-hierarchy. Their power, i.e., their capacity to promote favourable changes and prevent unwanted changes to the security environment, alongside their expansive interests and ambitions, so surpassed those of all others that they comprised a category unto themselves. This binary core was perceptibly driven, defined and shaped by an existential, zero-sum, strategic competition for global influence, if not control. As the superpowers threatened each other with cataclysmic thermonuclear devastation, should respective core interests be challenged, both were mutually deterred from initiating direct conflict.",

These constructs simplified complexities of the global political reality to the extent that formulaic application of these frameworks to policies addressing specific objectives guaranteed only partial success. The subordinateand sub-systems, too, comprised competitive and cooperative elements, with some actors gaining from patron-client networks fashioned by the rival superpowers while others, at least formally, retained non-aligned independence of action. Patron-client relations were usually formalised as alliances, generically described as intrusive systems, linking the systemic core to the periphery. As many of the nonaligned states were, in fact, tacit clients of either superpower, intrusive systems divided most of the planetary polity into rival camps. Since the superpowers desisted from direct conflict, their competition found expression in proxy-warfare among peripheral rival clients, whose ability to manage their local/regional disputes was eroded as systemic-subsystemic resonances deepened cleavages, raised stakes and intensified violence.",

With its only peer-rival removed from contention, the United States emerged as the sole superpower, the solitary core of a unipolar system. As no challenger questioned America's authority, this transition from a bipolar-to a unipolar core was largely untroubled. For many secondary and tertiary actors, in contrast, reorganising their domestic order and external relations simultaneously proved more traumatic. Some descended into civil-war, attracting external intervention with a view to restoring peace. But at the systemic core, unchallenged success bred a belief in the new order's indefinite immutability. For over a decade, the system-manager exercised hegemonic power in pursuit of its national interests, which were now seemingly reasonably conflated with global peace and stability.",

The direction of resource-flows changed from the West to the East, and from the North to the South. This process, eroding the systemic core's visibly unipolar attributes, triggered a gradual, mostly non-violent and possibly irreversible transition. However, by 2015, the core had not assumed definable contours of either an adversarial bipolarity, or a binary condominium. Nor had the system become definably multipolar, although aspects of all three paradigms became discernible. The post-Cold War dispensation had eroded but no new equilibrium had been established. The redistribution of resources, resultant transfers of power-capabilities and consequent changes in the global powerhierarchy precipitated systemic transitional fluidity noticeably since the late 1990s when the US national security establishment began identifying China as a near-peer-rival meriting close scrutiny. China denied hostile intent but responded in kind.",

Nonetheless, reality proved to be more complex than a monochromatic adherence to either school would suggest. As actors began to again rely on coercive deterrence to cope with the uncertainties triggered by systemic transitional fluidity, many of them, as members of multilateral institutions, also ceded elements of individual sovereignty, accepting instead institutionalised collective sovereignty, if only partially and reluctantly. The evolution of the European Union offered a model for other historically disputatious subordinate systems, but the fallout from the 2008-2010 Great Recession seemed to render wider acceptance and replication of this model momentarily moot.",

Power shifted horizontally from developed members of the dominant system to emerging economies within various subordinate systems, most prominently China, but also Russia, India, Brazil, as well as several hitherto tertiary actors, e.g., Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa. Most of these states were either allied to or aligned with America, or moving in that direction. So, in most cases, power-shift did not appear threatening to members of the erstwhile dominant system. The latter, after all, were almost equally concerned with the parallel process of vertical powerdiffusion from states to increasingly active non-state, sub-state and supra-state actors. Supra-state organisations e.g., the UN, especially the UNSC, other UN organs, the World Bank, IMF, Asian Development Bank, the WTO, and similar bodies, often backed with US resources, expanded their influence over developing states seeking their help. Although sometimes considered unresponsive to acute human needs in the pursuit of their liberalising missions, intrusions by these bodies were not perceived as fundamentally threatening.",

Operating across state-boundaries with newly-acquired freedoms, they challenged state-sovereignty in ways that could not meaningfully be countered with either conventional might or nuclear-armed military forces. Rapidly developing information-and-communication technology and ubiquitous devices armed with it allowed myriad groups, ranging from separatist guerrillas and terrorist organisations to socio-cultural networks and citizens' collectives, to organise and operate more cohesively than before. This enabled them to demand and often secure autonomous space both within the states in which they were active, and beyond.

Global warming/climate change, pandemics like Ebola and SARS, internal wars in fragile states such as Syria, Libya, Congo and Sudan, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, state-collapse and the spread of violent extremism exemplified other challenges no one actor, however powerful, could address alone. Faced with the combined consequences of these trends and processes, the state's relative autonomy, its monopoly of organised violence, and capacity to marshal a unifying meta-narrative subordinating all local/parochial sub-narratives, declined. As the nature and effect of power within the state changed, so did the nature and effect of interstate power within the international system.

Economic interests often urged close ties to China, for instance, while strategic insecurity forged closer links to America. In the post-Cold War period, as many component-states began asserting their individual identities, most subordinate systems declined in significance in strategic discourse. In contrast, regional subsystems acquired a higher profile as potential hot-spots and fault-lines between contending interests pursued by the status-quo oriented systemic primate, and its existentially and presumably revisionist 'near-peer competitor'. Since the 1990s, the West-Pacific subordinate-system, comprising North-Asian, East Asian and Southeast Asian sub-systems, as the focal point of Sino-US contention, attracted global attention. The competitivecooperative but otherwise unstated and still-evolving Sino-US diarchy, with its competitive character only generally acknowledged in official commentary, either precipitated numerous security complexes or profoundly affected incipient or pre-existing ones. While America and China, powers at the core of the evolving system, sought to avoid incidents between their armed forces escalating to confrontations, their endorsement of, or support for, the actions of their clients within Asia-Pacific security complexes and, occasionally, their own participation in certain regional security complexes, lowered the bar for and raised the prospects of such escalation, with potentially combustible consequences.",

In a constellation of five hypothetical actors named A, B, C, D and E, for instance, binary relations link A-B, A-C, A-D, A-E, B-C, B-D, B-E, C-D, C-E, and D-E. If the A-B linkage was more influential to both A and B in shaping both their mutual policies and policies towards the constellation's other components, then A-B could be described as a binary security complex. Sino-US relations can, as this study will demonstrate, reasonably be described as a binary security complex. While it has the most incendiary potential from a global security perspective, US and Chinese leaders have, until 2015, managed its evolution in a broadly non-violent fashion. The same cannot be said of their handling of other West Pacific security complexes. In a way, this trend recalls the Cold War era, when mutually deterred by the risk of catastrophic nuclear exchanges, rival superpowers transmitted their competitive impulses to peripheral actors waging proxy-conflicts. Key binary security complexes simmering across the wider Asia-Pacific region, aside from and around the core Sino-US dynamic, are China-Japan, South Korea-North Korea, and China-India.",

When a third actor enters the fray, the binary complex precipitates a strategic triangle which, owing to the added complexity of permutations and combinations of antagonistic action and the increased probability of misperception and miscalculation, further complicates the management of mutual insecurity. While a handful of strategic triangles in the Asia-Pacific region are congruent, meaning their component actors are closely cooperative in pursuit of shared interests and consonant policies, most are competitive. The US-Japan-ROK, US-Japan-India, US-Japan-Australia and Japan-Australia-India relational dynamics exemplify congruent strategic triangles. In contrast, US-Japan-China, US-ROK-DPRK, China-DPRK-ROK, China-DPRK-US, Japan-ROK-DPRK, US-China-India, and US-China-Australia are instances of competitive strategic triangles. With maritime/territorial disputes in the South China Sea (SCS) acquiring a high profile, the China-Vietnam-US and China-Philippines-US relational dynamics, too, instance competitive strategic triangles. The simultaneity of formation/activation, temporal-spatial proximity, and potentially inflammable interactions, of competitive strategic triangles threaten regional peace by explosively detonating Sino-US competition.

Improvement would be effected with America's overwhelming economic, scientific-technological and military dominance. America 'must build and maintain' its 'defenses beyond challenge.'

A dozen years later, another historian posited that America's decline, seen from a cultural-intellectual, as well as a military-political-economic perspective, had begun after its defeat in Vietnam [13] . This, however, was a minority view on the margins of academic discourses, far removed from policy debates animating the Washington Beltway. Most US practitioners and academic observers apparently believed, if to differing degrees, in the quasi-permanence of the strategic status quo. Shortly after al-Qaeda's aerial assaults on New York and Washington, Joseph Nye explained America's hitherto relaxed view of the world without. Post Soviet-fission, no rival could assail America's pre-eminence. The first Gulf War and NATO's bombing campaign against Serbia demonstrated the historical incomparability of US power. Consequently, 'Americans who did pay attention to foreign policy became arrogant about our power, arguing that we did not need to heed other nations. We seemed both invincible and invulnerable' [14] .",

These would telescope development, induction and integration of lethally networked mobile weapon-systems, train the manpower needed to deploy these in combat, and restructure the PLA organisationally to assimilate this 'new' force into existing formations. The process progressed so well that DoD told Congress, 'Over the long term, if current trends persist, PLA capabilities could pose a credible threat to other modern militaries operating in the region' [19] .

Chinese conventional ballistic missiles with submunition-warheads and improved guidance systems attaining circular-error-probability of less than 50 m could strike US and allied airfields and aircraft in Okinawa, elsewhere in Japan, and South Korea, eroding air-cover for US operations [21] .

Power in a unipolar system is so overwhelmingly concentrated in hegemonic hands that the distinction between secondary powers' threat perceptions and the threat inherent in the power of primacy is often blurred. Distance, the differences between offensive and defensive stances, and intentions no longer moderate the threat's existential nature from the percipient's perspective [35] . Dramatic power differentials separating the hegemon and other players mean the latter 'must worry primarily about the hegemon's capabilities rather than its intentions' [36] .

The PLA's AMS used a seven-category system comprising 29 secondary indices and over 100 tertiary indices; CASS applied eight categories and 64 indices; CICIR used a seven-category, 115-indices system, and analysts at Beijing's Tsinghua University developed eight categories and 23 indices [66] . One school posited that however CNP was calculated, the power status of states was essentially relative and reflected or shaped the order undergirding international politics. The growth in a state's power indicated an expansion of its autonomy within the international system, causing the relative contraction of the autonomous space of other actors. This was the zero-sum nature, in this view, of systemic power dynamics [67] . In the post-Cold War era of a sole-superpower facing several secondary major-powers, America was 'destined to defend its status against any possible challenging states.' As a major secondary power, 'China automatically becomes an opponent of the United States' [68]. By 2005, Chinese and some non-Chinese commentators were predicting China's ascent to the status of a superpower within the first few decades of the twenty first century [69] .",

Sun Zi classified rulers on the bases of two attributes-mores and ethics, and power and strength. A 'True King' displayed strong mores and ethics and although usually had strong power, it was possible for a True King to have some weaknesses in power. Subjects voluntarily submitted to a true king. A hegemon displayed fairness and honesty in mores and ethics, and exercised strong power. Subjects accepted a hegemon's authority primarily because of the coercive costs of challenging it.

Mo Di's followers, the Mohists, became a wellorganised order with influential networks across much of China. However, after the fall of the Qin dynasty in 206BCE, Mohists lost their influence and organisational cohesion, and whole chapters of the Mozi texts were either lost or corrupted. Only in modern times has most of the Mozi been rediscovered, collected, translated and analysed. The Mozi distinguished between two kinds of warfare, Zhucombat against unjust aggressors, and Gong-war of expansion and aggression. Mo Di and Mohists opposed Gong and supported those waging Zhu [85] . Mohists also propagated an additional concept-jian'ai, or universal love, bereft of which robbers robbed others, and kings invaded other kingdoms. Mo Di said, '. . .regard the state of others as one's own, the houses of others as one's own, the persons of others as one's self.

Key economic decisions on wartime taxation and monopolies as well as military and diplomatic policies were debated. The record of these exchanges, Discourses on Salt and Iron, became a key contribution to Chinese statecraft. While a senior minister urged the use of superior force against weaker neighbouring powers to achieve inexpensive but beneficial expansion, scholars argued that military expansion was often shortsighted, cost a lot but brought little profit, increased domestic burdens and could cause state-collapse. They advised that 'Broad virtue will bring distant people to come and follow' [88] . By contrasting a powerful force capable of expanding territory with 'broad virtue' which brought 'distant countries to submit', the cognoscenti offered an alternative paradigm of 'expansion by submission' [89] .

Considering the tributary system as a functional tool of immutable utility through this long and variegated period would be inaccurate. Besides, whether China's rulers formulated foreign policy solely, or primarily, on the basis of an assumed superiority of Sinic attributes throughout the two millennia of dynastic rule remained uncertain. In this view, a distinction must be made between a strong China and a weak China, a unified empire and a fragmented, fractious agglomeration. Actual, fungible, power and the nature of the external environment were likely to have shaped Chinese diplomacy as much as did a sense of Chinese superiority. Power realities modified and moderated Sinocentricity and a belief in the 'barbarian' inferiority\" [97] . How non-Chinese rulers viewed China and why some but not all of them voluntarily submitted to a tributary relationship are not explained by either Western or Chinese scholarship. In fact, the system did not even consider the reality of diminishing power over increasing distances from the Chinese capital in ancient times.",

They reigned over a spectrum of diminishing influence stretching through an inner vassal area, an outer vassal area and a 'temporary non-vassal area'. Chinese rulers did not expect to exercise authority over the last, and often treated them as equals. The Sui and Tang dynasties, for instance, maintained 'fraternal' relations with Tibetan, Turkic and Uighur polities before the Han finally subdued and subjugated these [98] . So, the tribute system might be useful in describing and explaining China's regional foreign relations in periods of imperial cohesion and power, but it did not offer an immutable framework for appreciating Chinese diplomacy at other times. While examinations of historical experience enriched China's intellectual capital, deepened understanding of the complexity of the polity's past, and perhaps helped China gain international respect for the rich heritage bestowed by its antiquity, such exercises made limited contributions to China's ability to manage and respond to more contemporary issues and challenges. And the latter did prove increasingly complex, although China's 'national rejuvenation' catapulted it from the ranks of secondary actors to close to the peak of the systemic hierarchy at the end of the first decade of the twenty first century.",

DoD's MDA confirmed in 2012 the details of the US-Japan SM-3 Cooperative Development Programme designed to upgrade the system with the 21-in. diameter SM-3 Block IIA missiles aiming 'to defeat longer range ballistic missiles' [104] .

Chinese commentary, describing US missile-defence programmes as destabilising, reflected profound angst. In 2001, shortly before Washington abrogated the ABM Treaty, Sha Zukang, head of China's Arms Control and Disarmament Department, said, the US National Missile Defence (NMD) programme would not only undermine global strategic balance and stability, but also disrupt efforts for security in the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover, the US also intends to deploy Theatre Missile Defense (TMD) in the region. Research and development of TMD per se may not necessarily constitute a violation of the ABM Treaty. But, the crucial question is how large is the scale and what are the nature and function of TMD that the U.S. is prepared to deploy in Asia.

Unilateralism will only lead to greater insecurity. . .The United States possesses the biggest nuclear arsenal and the most sophisticated conventional weapons in the world, and it pursues a deterrence policy based on first use of nuclear weapons. A missile defense will severely impede the nuclear disarmament process and render any U.S. initiative on the reduction of offensive nuclear weapons meaningless. . .Is it really to defend against the missile threat from the few so-called \"problem states,\" or for greater military advantage over other big countries? [106] Chinese concerns appeared to be straightforward: NMD/BMD systems, once installed, would protect the entire United States from ballistic missile attacks such as a hypothetical Chinese second-strike. This would reduce the efficacy of China's nuclear deterrent to something approximating zero. Additionally, given the small number of the PLA's ICBMs, interceptors 'deployed on a single site may be enough to knock out all Chinese CSS-4' ICBMs [107] , laying China open to a decapitating first-strike. Close links between US-Japanese BMD efforts and the MDA's C4ISR coordination in target-data acquisition, processing, and dissemination, and in operations, meant Japanese BMD assets located in China's neighbourhood reinforced America's NMD carapace, eroding the efficacy of China's strategic deterrent [108] . Comments by a Congressional specialist in ballistic missile-related strategy, in the wake of a significant expansion of the US BMD network in Japan and Southeast Asia, revealed by Secretary of Defence Panetta in 2012, confirmed Chinese fears of US plans to neuter Beijing's deterrent, hobbling China's freedom of action and exposing it to potentially existential threats: 'The focus of our rhetoric is North Korea.

Given the convergence of historical Sino-American focus on the question of Taiwan's future-whether Taiwan will seek de jure independence and be able to count on American interventionist support and deter a Chinese military response, or acquiesce in re-unification under duress, much of the PLA's efforts prior to Hu Jintao's 2004 proclamation of 'New Historic Missions' beyond Taiwan had indeed focused on Taiwan.

After five centuries of Western domination, power was now flowing to other parts of the planet, especially Asia. Countries hitherto on the fringes of the global economic/financial core, especially China, had become central to its productive patterns, and resources from these centres were flowing outwards to recapitalise developed countries' financial sectors. The replacement of the G7/8 by the G20 as the premier global governance forum reflected and reinforced this trend. 'While America will remain the single most important actor, especially militarily, its relative power has declined together with its political and moral influence' [141] . However, if America was no longer the centre of a unipolar order, neither were Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) able or willing to act as power-centres responsible for maintaining a stable multipolar system.",

The international security system was rapidly evolving, but 'toward what' remained unclear [142] . Profound uncertainties over the future notwithstanding, the study identified Sino-US relations as an area of 'critical foreign policy challenge'. The difficulty resided in a China which generally acted in a restrained and reassuring manner while developing advanced military capabilities and expanding its regional and global influence. Having defied Western predictions of political-economic collapse or substantial change in the 1990s following the Soviet fission, China had reformed itself economically to generate sustained growth without political reforms.",

Instead of formally identifying China as either a partner or an adversary, America had hitherto sought to take advantage of China's growing economy and influence while hedging against its 'emergence as a future threat' [143] . Washington would have to develop a more nuanced approach while building on the 'hedging while engaging' strategy [144] . The study's authors urged America to welcome 'restrained and responsible Chinese behaviour', while noting that Washington 'must also recognize and prepare for the more complex policy challenges a strong China will pose' [145] .",

Constant global engagement using 'smart power' was needed to restore and maintain American leadership [146] . The way ahead was charted by an influential group of analysts including senior officials in the outgoing Bush Administration and others being inducted into its successor [147] . They pointed out that Ongoing shifts in geopolitical power from west to east make the Asia-Pacific region more important to the United States today than ever before. The region is already an engine of the global economy, and major Asian countries are becoming global economic and political actors. Yet, as Asia's importance has grown over the last decades, Washington has often been focused elsewhere. The Obama administration needs a more active approach to the Asia-Pacific region that recognizes the new geopolitical realities and positions the United States to deal effectively with the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Such a strategy must build upon America's long-standing positive engagement in Asia and articulate a vision that can advance US interests and attract support from countries in the region [148] .",

A 2002 meeting between Defence Ministers and a summit between President Bush and Prime Minister Koizumi in 2003 accelerated the pace of BMD co-operation. In December 2003, Tokyo decided to deploy an operational BMD system to defend Japanese territorial expanse.

In June 2006, the allies launched the 'joint cooperative development' of the Standard Missile (SM)-3Block IIA. In March 2007, Japan deployed US-supplied PAC-3 Patriot ABM systems for local BMD operations at Iruma Air Base, with additional deployments which followed.",
