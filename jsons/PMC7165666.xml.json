            "text": "On 20 July 2014, Liberian Patrick Sawyer disembarked from an ASKY Airlines flight to Lagos, vomiting and showing signs of illness. Although Sawyer was quarantined immediately and taken to the hospital upon arrival, he infected nine doctors and nurses, as well as several contact persons at the airport, and died five days later. Sawyer became known as Nigeria's Ebola index case: he arrived amidst a historically unprecedented outbreak of Ebola fever in West Africa that swept across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In contrast to earlier outbreaks, the epidemic did not seem to be confined to rural areas and smaller villages, but spread to the countries' urban populations. Up to this time, Nigeria (Africa's most populous country, which includes Lagos, a megacity with an estimated population of 17 million) had not reported any cases of Ebola infection, but all of a sudden Lagos's high population density, its sanitary infrastructure and the complex mobility patterns of its inhabitants were discussed as posing a challenge to contact tracing and other infection control measures. This prompted the US Consul General in Nigeria, Jeffrey Hawkins, to invoke dreadful images of an \u2018apocalyptic urban outbreak'. The World Health Organization described the situation as a \u2018powder keg' (WHO, 2014), and alarming visions of possible outbreak scenarios in Lagos spread across the media. What had happened here? And what would happen next?",

In this regard, urban environments are often depicted as areas at risk of infectious disease outbreaks3.3 Between 1925 and 1950, infectious diseases constituted the leading cause of mortality among the populations of industrialized cities (McMichael, 2000: 1118). A wide variety of health threats characteristic of urban environments\u2014ranging from poor sanitary conditions to malnutrition, polluted water, high population density and inadequate housing\u2014created serious public health problems and provided a fertile breeding ground for microbial and viral agents (Hardy, 1993; de Landa, 1997; V\u00f6gele and Woelk, 2001; Hardy, 2005).",

Indeed, cities are affected differently by climatic conditions, life expectancies, water infrastructures, legal regimes, transnational mobility, financial resources, population density, health beliefs and practices, development plans and governance structures. These, in turn, have an impact on the emergence, problematization and management of disease and disease risks: vector\u2010borne diseases, for example, are more common in regions with a warmer climate. Financial resources are required to build a medical infrastructure, and governance structures might determine the flow of resources and equipment. Densely populated areas are especially prone to outbreaks of infectious diseases, while local legal regimes require the management of index cases and contacts. Mobility hubs might serve as entry points for infectious agents, but also for medical expertise and vaccines. Health beliefs might facilitate or hinder treatment. In consequence, Helsinki, for example, faces different health problems to Port\u2010au\u2010Prince or Jakarta. But how, then, can the \u2018urban' aspect of urban epidemics be tackled?",

One way would be to view infectious diseases as the result of biocultural interactions. In terms of this approach, the health and disease of urban inhabitants can be approached through an analytical blending of environmental effects (for example, population density, infrastructure, sanitary conditions), biological dynamics (for example, immune status, microbial performance) and social practices (for example, mobility patterns, burial rituals). For each of these dimensions, different dynamics are at play, from processes of population growth to practices of waste management, and from individual explanatory models to syndemic interactions at the micro\u2010level. We might ask, for example, what concepts of environment undergird the identification of areas of risk, why some people seem to be more susceptible than others, and to what extent social processes are taken into consideration in the classification of vulnerable population groups. As illustrated by the example of Lagos, conventional models of urban health governance, and their institutional routines and norms, might be challenged in certain urban environments, but not in others.",

As a large number of urban epidemics\u2014such as dengue fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and HIV\u2014are of zoonotic or vector\u2010borne origin, the question as to what kind of nature is at play becomes all the more pressing. This liveliness of cities (Hinchliffe and Whatmore, 2006) can be rooted in agricultural patterns (such as rooftop poultry or wet markets), in urban flows, nooks and crannies (ranging from rivers over sewage systems to puddles and mosquito breeding habitats), or in the very epidemiology of diseases themselves (Ebola outbreaks, for instance, are often discussed in the context of bush meat consumption). What urban nature actually entails, and how this influences our conceptualization of urban health, is itself up for debate.",

Microbial emergence as a biosecurity issue is problematized and made visible within specific urban contexts, as pathogens are not only of biomedical significance, but also relevant to a number of other sociotechnical domains. Accordingly, biosecurity concerns arise in different areas of civil protection, food safety, public health and environmentalism, each field tending to stress the vulnerability of cities, each focusing on different aspects of urban environments (for example, water infrastructures, climatic conditions, global interconnectedness or the implementation of vaccination programmes). Within biosecurity approaches, we are able to focus on the topological dimensions of urban epidemics and infection control measures. Kezia Barker, Sarah Taylor and Andrew Dobson (Barker et al., 2013) remind us that biosecurity practices do not simply constitute a response to disease events, but are part of a wider process of problematization and politicization. Perspectives such as these might give us a better grasp of how emerging pathogens are translated into local risks to be acted upon, how geopolitical boundaries are reinforced or circumvented in this process, and how the management of unruly matter affects the lives of urban inhabitants.",

            "text": "When seeking to understand how urban environments are configured as areas at risk of infectious disease outbreaks, a good starting point is the examination of the concept of emergence itself. Emerging infections are increasingly problematized in the context of urbanization and globalization processes, as these are believed to accelerate the emergence, development and spread of infectious diseases (often illustrated with reference to empirical cases of SARS, avian flu and swine flu\u2014 see Alirol et al., 2011; see also Saker et al., 2004). By accepting this view of the emergence of infectious disease as a natural consequence of urbanization and globalization processes, we fail to see that the concept of emergence itself is only enacted within specific analytical frameworks. These frameworks, for example, the 1992 Institute of Medicine report (Lederberg et al., 1992), consist of classification schemes, national and international surveillance systems, funding bodies and political rationales (see Washer, 2014). They determine what can be seen, known or said within the biomedical and political context of emerging diseases. Underlying assumptions concern the movement of pathogens from disease\u2010 ridden to disease\u2010free areas. Scholars such as Paul Farmer, M\u00e1rcia Grisotti and Fernando Dias de \u00c1vila\u2010Pires argue that the classification of an emerging infectious disease is contingent on reliable systems of notification and the conception of risk groups. According to these critical accounts, pathogens do not suddenly \u2018emerge' somewhere, for instance in the backyard of an Indonesian poultry farmer (see also Hinchliffe and Bingham, 2008a). In order to be classified as emerging, a pathogen needs to be linked to a specific disease, to a vulnerable population, to surveillance systems and to a territory (Farmer, 1996; Grisotti and Dias de \u00c1vila\u2010Pires, 2010; see also F\u00fcller, 2014). Consequently, a large number of pathogens and infectious diseases slip through the net. Similarly, critical biosecurity scholars note that emerging microbial agents are articulated and problematized through different political and normative frameworks in order to be transformed into microbial risks that can be calculated, known, managed or visualized. During this process, they achieve political and biomedical visibility. Possible domains of problematization include anxieties about bioterrorism, food safety, health or biosafety (Collier and Lakoff, 2008: 9\u201312; Dobson et al., 2013; see also Caduff, 2008). Seen from these perspectives, the emergence, development and spread of infectious diseases do not simply rely on a given global order, but coproduce this very order.",

The growing number of diverse publications concerned with these issues bear witness to a stirring discussion, and as attempts to synthesize them would probably be regarded as fussy and reductive, I do not claim to present an exhaustive overview. Instead, I aim to frame the different approaches dedicated to the material consequences of globalized urban environments and to outline further research questions and challenges. The diverse ideas and concepts discussed in this article can be regarded as different lenses offering different ways of communicating about the complex subject of urban infections. Although I write from the perspective of cultural anthropology I include numerous sources and field\u2010based approaches that have emerged from scholarship in cultural and human geography, political ecology and sociology, and bring them into dialogue with one another. The article is structured as follows. First, it explores the implications of urban health, taking into account the idea that disease as a biocultural event is contingent on environmental conditions and that the urban setting might be more than a locus of these interactions. Secondly, it focuses on the links between \u2018nature' and urban environments in order to underscore the dynamic and complex character of infectious disease aetiologies. Thirdly, it examines the political, social and theoretical responses to contagious outbreaks in urban areas to help us understand the lineaments of \u2018networked diseases' (Ali and Keil, 2008) and their prevention.",

As medical anthropologist Margaret Lock (2012: 129) suggests, a biocultural focus may help us overcome simple \u2018culturalistic' cause\u2013effect relationships and develop a more thorough understanding of human embodiment within distinct historical and spatial contexts. A first, substantial step in analysing the complex relationship between urban physical\u2010material environments and the multitude of bodies (human and non\u2010human) that inhabit them is to recognize the human body as a molecularized body, as a biocultural and embedded agent, as Lock claims (ibid.). In this context, geographer Nigel Clarks uses the example of the common cold virus to illustrate the ongoing openness of bodies to other forms of biological life: \u2018assorted seeping, dribbling, spraying of excessive bodily fluid [is] an indicator of an outgoing porosity that follows an earlier ingoing perviousness' (Clarke, 2004, cited in Greenhough, 2008: 1).

The World Health Organization reacted accordingly and created the Healthy Cities Project in 1986, reflecting the socio\u2010political significance of urban and community health. In their classic study on community health and the urban poor, Harpham et al. (1988) describe and classify health problems that are characteristic of, but not confined to, the urban poor. They draw distinctions between the following: (1) problems that directly result from poverty, such as unemployment, low income and malnutrition; (2) environmental problems caused, for instance, by lack of water supply, high traffic volumes, exposure to infectious agents and overcrowding; and (3) psychosocial problems, such as stress, depression and substance abuse. Urban environments, according to Harpham et al. (ibid.), demonstrate a tendency to combine health problems resulting from poverty and \u2018underdevelopment' with those usually attributed to industrialized areas. The authors strive to provide policy\u2010relevant insights on how urbanization processes, funding constraints and restricted health care services directly affect the living conditions of the urban poor, especially in the global South. Overcrowding and high population density, international connectivity and the close proximity of different species also contribute to the fact that cities tend to be vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks (although this vulnerability is distributed unequally between and within countries).",

            "text": "In 1991, medical anthropologist Carl Kendall explicitly associated infectious disease ecologies with urban built environments (see Kendall et al., 1991). In their study on dengue fever and urbanization processes in America and the Caribbean, the authors show how local responses to infectious disease outbreaks may contrast sharply with public health education programmes (ibid.). Based on their analysis of the cities of Merida (Mexico) and El Progreso (Honduras) as urban social worlds and urban ecosystems, they claim that new disease ecologies emerge in tandem with the growth of slums and shanty towns: mosquito\u2010borne infections such as dengue fever and malaria benefit significantly from stagnant water (puddles, flower vases, barrels, dishes) near residential areas, as the disease\u2010carrying mosquitoes like to breed in standing water. Nevertheless, public health education in the affected areas has proven largely ineffective because it collides with people's explanatory models for disease: they attribute dengue fever to malicious \u2018winds' instead of to mosquito bites, or simply mistake it for the common flu.55 Consequently, they argue that dengue fever has to be understood as symptomatic of changes in disease epidemiology (ibid.). One of the most striking findings of their analysis is that multiple features of modernity, such as urbanization processes, transnational travel and trade, and the accumulation of garbage owing to a scarcity of community resources, contribute to the emergence of infectious diseases within urban areas, but these are also intertwined with local knowledge. On the basis of their findings, Kendall et al. amply demonstrate that neither technological solutions nor health education alone will help us overcome this complex assemblage of infectious disease aetiologies. The authors draw attention to the unequal processes of urban development worldwide and simultaneously sketch a general \u2018rise of the city', embedded in a larger framework of population growth, modernization and urbanization. In this context, rural areas are primarily defined by a lack of water infrastructure and education\u2014but it remains unclear how this development is connected to urban environments and how these environments, in turn, are affected by urban expansion or urban development processes.",

For example, the Aedes aegypti mosquito is now found to be closely associated with human habitation and has become endemic in many urban areas (Rigau\u2010P\u00e9rez et al., 1998). The urgent need to develop sustainable and effective prevention measures is increasingly being recognized, and current research into the transmission cycles of the dengue virus has provided insight into how new larval habitats emerge from neglected swimming pools in the US (Reisen et al., 2008), how socioeconomic, institutional, spatial and political contexts have an impact on mosquito management strategies (Shaw et al., 2010), and how urban household waste such as coconut shells, pitchers and plastic containers contribute to mosquito breeding (Banerjee et al., 2013). Overall, it is now increasingly clear that the epidemiology of the dengue virus is deeply intertwined with ongoing urbanization processes and the hybrid landscapes they create.66 These accounts present the city as a breeding habitat that is strictly confined to the climatic conditions required for dengue mosquitoes to reproduce (usually tropical and subtropical areas). They focus on the mutual entrapments of waste or environmental management strategies and mosquito transduction processes that contribute to the emergence of mosquito\u2010borne infectious diseases, and are particularly helpful in questioning their underlying spatialities and institutional routines. Subtropical urban and suburban areas are here described as contingent, risky and expansive. The assumed dialectical relationship between natural sites and urban environments, however, is transgressed by the mosquitoes themselves as they transform the \u2018nooks and crannies of natural and urban spaces' (Shaw et al., 2010: 376) into breeding sites. Also, within these accounts, disease emergence is closely connected to particular historical moments, such as developments in the housing market, thus subverting any attempt to implement generic disease control strategies.",

Medical anthropologist Arthur Kleinman and colleagues (Kleinman and Watson, 2006) devoted a body of interdisciplinary work to the 2002/2003 SARS outbreak in China, particularly Hong Kong, which they analyse in terms of transmission, disruption and flow. SARS, a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus, was first identified in early 2003 and is believed to have started in the Guangdong province in China. Having infected a businessman travelling from Guangdong to Hong Kong, the virus spread rapidly from China to numerous countries worldwide and created a serious public health crisis. During the pandemic, global cities and international mobility hubs such as Hong Kong and Toronto seemed to play a key role in the spread of the disease. Much more than merely a site for emerging microbial and viral agents, urban Hong Kong proved to pose a specific problem for public health officials. A well\u2010known example is that of Amoy Gardens, a large apartment complex with 17,000 inhabitants, where more than 300 persons were infected. Its residents experienced not only serious SARS\u2010related stigmatization, resulting in unemployment, quarantine, social isolation and various services being refused (Kleinman and Lee, 2006)\u2014the building itself seems to have facilitated the spread of the virus because of its specific microclimatic conditions and constructional features. Virally laden aerosols were transported via air shafts, plumbing systems and floor drains as well as via the multizone airflow between the flats (Yu et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005; McKinney et al., 2006). Rumours and uncertainty spread, as Lee and Kwok Wing (2006) explain in their brief description of social suffering as a result of SARS:The lay public \u2026 speculated about the causes and means by which the infection was spreading: cockroaches, rats, sewage pipes, elevator buttons, or construction workers urinating nearby the apartment complex. Until the Amoy Gardens outbreak, most local citizens believed that they could avoid SARS by not leaving their homes. But now the home itself had become a dangerous site (Lee and Kwok Wing, 2006: 137).\n",

They conceptualize the city as an environmental condition and context; their points of reference are communities and populations in inner\u2010city areas (without defining the characteristics, differences or boundaries of these areas). Whereas biomedical classification systems, as the authors state, rely on conceptions that understand diseases as \u2018distinct, discrete, and disjunctive entities that exist (in theory) separate from other diseases and from the social groups and social contexts in which they are found' (ibid.: 424), they suggest reconceptualizing diseases as contextualized events resulting from multiple biological interactions among certain health conditions (see also Draus, 2004, for an account of syndemic patterns of tuberculosis). Singer and Clair (2003) use HIV infection in injection drug users in three New England cities as an illustrative example of syndemic interactions between the virus, other major diseases (including hepatitis, STDs, pneumonia and symptoms such as abscesses are the most important) and homelessness. They show how poverty and social deprivation foster the emergence of viral synergisms and result in enhanced infections owing to a high density of pathogenic interactions.77 The presence of the HI virus seems to trigger other infections, and this synergism appears to take advantage of homelessness. Similarly, sociologist Eric Klinenberg (2003) in his social autopsy of the Chicago heat wave of 1995 shows how cities in the US are characterized by new vulnerabilities. Social and ecological conditions such as social isolation, poverty, the downsizing and privatization of public health infrastructures, architectural features, the housing market and the delivery of social services, he claims, all contribute to the making of \u2018natural' disasters and the diverse impact thereof on local populations. He portrays the city of Chicago as a potentially lethal environment, characterized by degradation, fear and the fortification of public space. The city's physical, social and political structure is determined by larger demographic changes in the US.

However, what they have in common is a focus on cities as environments (Kendall et al., 1991; Klinenberg, 2003), as environmental condition (Singer and Clair, 2003) or as habitation (Rigau\u2010P\u00e9rez et al., 1998; Banerjee et al., 2013). These approaches also highlight the unequal distribution of risk and vulnerability between and within diverse local contexts, rendering some bodies more susceptible than others. Disease in these settings is described as interaction: two distinct and bounded entities (environments and bodies) interact. Consequently, this interaction is open to intervention, for example, through the building of infrastructure, the management of toxic exposure or the destruction of mosquito breeding sites. In other words, health in these accounts seems to result from the successful management of environmental risks and individual health\u2010related behaviour; thus, infectious diseases are less of a natural disaster, but \u2018emerge' alongside social structures and inequalities in housing, health education or financial resources.",

The line of enquiry discussed in this subsection of the article requires close attention to the material and social dimensions of infectious disease aetiologies within urban settings. It also requires an openness to actors often regarded as marginally important in urban theory (including those we would rather live without, such as rodents, insects and microbes), as well as engagement with biomedical and biological sciences. Clearly, an understanding of other biological actors is essential to an understanding of human health and human social, economic, political and urban life, since a large number of infectious diseases are of zoonotic or vector\u2010borne origin. Zoonotic diseases (such as influenza, bovine tuberculosis, rabies and many viral haemorrhagic fevers) can be passed between humans and animals, whereas vector\u2010borne diseases (such as malaria, dengue fever, plague and Chagas disease) are caused by viruses, bacteria or parasites transmitted through vectors such as mosquitoes or fleas between humans or between humans and vertebrate animals. They have different implications for social science or public health interventions. Many vector\u2010borne diseases are confined to certain climatic conditions (often tropical or subtropical areas); however, a growing section of the human population is affected on a global scale. These diseases spread slowly and can only establish themselves once their vector is accommodated to its new habitat (a malaria outbreak in Nuuk, Greenland, is currently highly unlikely). Disease management in the case of vector\u2010borne diseases might target the human population, the vector or the pathogen. Zoonotic diseases, by contrast, possess higher mobility, they might spread quickly and are not confined to particular geographical areas: an influenza outbreak in Nuuk is not at all unlikely. The management of zoonotic diseases needs to engage with human as well as with animal health and with the environments the species in question inhabit and produce.",

Desfor and Keil (2000) take local state institutions and political processes as a starting point to analyse the governance of growing complexity in world cities; they understand environmentalism both as a strategy of urban politics and as a discourse of liberation under neoliberal capitalism. Apart from the health concerns associated with environmental regulation processes (such as air and soil pollution), one of the striking findings, noted in Desfor and Keil's work, for my purposes here, is their advocacy to accept urbanization \u2018as the major condition of our living in the natural world, while recognizing the existence of a natural, physical, and biological world beyond the reach of urban life' (Desfor and Keil, 2004: 214\u201315; see also Desfor and Keil, 2000).

In seeking to understand cities as biopolitical and topological spaces and to \u2018think the city through SARS', Braun focuses his attention on a set of previously absent actors\u2014such as microbes and animals, but also technical features, such as sewage systems and airports\u2014and their contribution to the city's socio\u2010material composition. He suggests the need to understand the city as an unbounded and polyrhythmic space, that is, to stretch the molecular geography of urban environments beyond their built boundaries. As \u2018more\u2010than\u2010human' spaces (Whatmore, 2006), cities and the multitude of bodies and organisms that inhabit them are organized within global networks of interaction and disease transmission, as became apparent during the SARS epidemic. Braun explains the situation as follows: \u2018These networks are at once biological, technological, political, and economic, and they are at the same time local and global' (Braun, 2008: 265). In consequence, he argues, the surveillance, maintenance and governance of urban health can no longer be based on local practices and local bodies, but are a matter of global concern, binding cities and the bodies that inhabit them into a global biopolitical order (Braun, 2007). Braun's approach captures a specific historical moment of urban governance and urban topology confined to the global cities of Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Taipei. While he describes a kind of city in which the urban and the rural are entwined in \u2018city\u2010nature\u2010formations' (2008: 257), he presupposes that the concept of city\u2010nature\u2010formations relies on a dichotomist construction of cities and natures, but does not question or analyse it in detail.

In the broadest sense, urban metabolism provides a framework for looking critically at the material\u2010semiotic flows of water, norms, energy, information, waste and knowledge that constitute the modern city. Although the concept of urban metabolism has a long heritage in political economy (Brenner et al., 2011: 232), it tends to expand the methodological toolkit by incorporating some of the concepts developed within actor\u2010network theory (ANT) and science and technology studies (STS), such as the integration of non\u2010human actors and hybrids (Latour, 1993). Indeed, one way of understanding the dialectical relationship of nature and the city, as geographer Maria Kaika (2005) suggests, has been to trace the manufacturing of urban nature in Western metropoles by their spatial and material impacts, a construction process she call \u2018the urbanization of nature'. Interestingly, as Kaika (ibid.) shows, modernist ideas and engineering attempts to release cities from any natural processes, in fact, demonstrate opposite results, namely, the binding of nature and city, of complex ecologies of social, technological, scientific, material and biological agents, into a socio\u2010spatial continuum.

In nineteenth\u2010century Europe, the dawn of bacteriological medicine brought about a reconceptualization of organicist interpretations of urban order in terms of sanitation, rationalization, hygiene and water purification technologies. As the invention of novel water supply systems ties the privacy of the modern home to larger urban physical metabolisms, the \u2018bacteriological city' as a distinctive socio\u2010spatial area can be explored through the concept of Foucault's biopolitical dynamics. In order to capture the relationship between individual bodies and social discipline, Gandy (2004: 367) argues that it is useful to link ideologies of hygiene and cleanliness to the wider regulation of social order through public health campaigns, urban restructuring processes, water infrastructures and, finally, the construction of a public realm. Against the backdrop of municipal governance attempts, the rationalized modern city, rooted in nineteenth\u2010century capitalist urbanization, facilitates the political control of urban space. While cautioning against teleological approaches of urban space, Gandy (2006) portrays the \u2018bacteriological city' as an assembled dynamic, fractured by underlying (political, economic and social) tensions and contradictions. European and North American industrialized cities are defined as coherent functional entities, in contrast to rural areas in India or sub\u2010Saharan Africa, which are characterized by water scarcity. The concept of the \u2018bacteriological city' is insightful in so far as it traces the hidden co\u2010evolutionary dynamics of urban flows, which are simultaneously social, biological, political, technical and microbial.

According to social scientists Ignacio Far\u00edas and Thomas Bender (2010), contemporary urban life requires new forms of analysis in which the city is examined from a relational and decentred perspective. Far\u00edas and Bender (ibid.) make productive use of ANT as a laboratory for urban studies scholars who perform empirical analyses by looking at issues of scale, ecology and sociotechnical practice. Thus, in order to draw attention to heterogeneous urban networks\u2014multiple human and non\u2010human actors and spaces condensing into what is termed \u2018urban assemblages'\u2014Far\u00edas and Bender (ibid.) argue we must come close to a critical scrutiny of the shifting terrains of social categories such as society, the global\u2010local differentiation, structure, scale or city. The application of ANT to urban studies provides a metaphoric approach that is highly sensitive to \u2018urban complexity, of the unities and disunities, of the stabilities and instabilities, and especially the complex and heterogeneous networks of connection and association out of which the city as a social and a physical entity is formed and sustained' (Bender, 2010: 315\u201316).

A focus on human/non\u2010human domains and hybrid collectives, might make other aspects of urban life\u2014political development, urban governance or spatial development\u2014fade into the background.88 Anthropologist Nikhil Anand (2011) in his ethnographic work on hydraulic infrastructures in Mumbai aimed to combine political ecology approaches with science studies. His analysis focuses on the multiple ways in which settlers try to access the municipal water system. As access is only granted to those who can officially prove that they occupied their settlements before 1995, others have to mobilize social and material relationships in order to access water. Plumbers, engineers and politicians play a key role in these processes. Mumbai, as Anand depicts it, has to be understood as a settlement and a living condition mediated by unequal, topographical and hierarchical relationships. He shows how cities have to be actively claimed and made liveable by their inhabitants (although certain populations\u2014for example, Muslims\u2014are excluded from these claims). What is important in these accounts is a focus on the topography of the city as a politically and physically mediated reality, and as nature that is enacted in socio\u2010political relationships, rather than treated as a passive substrate or a stable essence.",

In their efforts to reintroduce the concept of microorganisms, anthropologists Heather Paxson and Stefan Helmreich (2014) propose a focus on \u2018novel natures' in which a broad range of organisms are enrolled in the process of history making, scientific practices and social life.99 For them, these novel natures highlight the indeterminateness of biology, which indicates that its manifold possibilities are yet to be explored. Their novel natures\u2014as reflected in the microbial turn of biology and biomedicine\u2014swarm with \u2018organismic operations unfolding at scales below everyday human perception, simultaneously independent of and entangled with, enabling of, and sometimes unwinding of human, animal, plant, and fungal biological identity and community' (ibid.: 2; based on McFall\u2010Ngai et al., 2013). Bacteria, then, highlight a particular condition of living within and alongside biological nature (ibid.: 20), namely, a shift away from ontological conceptions of life itself towards framing the question of how we wish to live with other organisms and what forms of life this would include (ibid.; see also Paxson, 2008). From the perspective of microbial agency and novel natures, then, the concept of infection cannot be confined to the interaction of two bounded, distinct and ontologically diverse entities (the host and the pathogen). Instead, humans and their habitations are always already partly microbial. Consequently, novel ways of intervention might not necessarily aim to interrupt interaction, but implement new ways of interaction.1010",

Indeed, although urban environments might seem to be exclusively inhabited by humans, current research shows that we share urban space and urban susceptibility with a number of fellow creatures. A great number of biological agents such as birds, rodents, insects and viruses are urban dwellers too, and many remain invisible to the human eye and effectively circumvent control technologies. The past few years have shown a growing inclination to bring other species back into discussions that have traditionally been dominated by a theoretical perspective focusing on anthropos alone (Kirksey and Helmreich, 2010). Swarms\u2014or \u2018clouds' (Lowe, 2010)\u2014of microbial and viral agents, for example, consider urban environments and their inhabitants to be ideal habitats. Multispecies scholar Alex Nading (2012, 2014; ) suggests bridging critical approaches of biosecurity on the one hand, and nonlinear approaches of emergence and becoming on the other hand, by focusing on entanglements: \u2018from the perspective of entanglement, people, birds, pathogens, and spaces are connected in a process of \u201cmutual becoming\u201d' (Nading, 2012: 69). In this context, Nading (ibid.), in his ethnographic study of local dengue control programmes in urban Nicaragua, explores the boundaries drawn between human and non\u2010human actors through mosquito management strategies. His research shows that anti\u2010dengue advertising campaigns that promote a participatory approach by integrating female community workers (brigadistas) into the regulation of urban mosquito populations seem not to have solved the problem. These campaigns depict a vision of disciplined households where humans and insects are kept strictly apart, and where the female members of these households are assigned full responsibility for sanitation. Nading, who joined several teams of local brigadistas during their search for hidden larval habitats (such as flowerpots, bottle caps and coconut shells), observed profound discrepancies between scientific attempts at separating humans from insects and the brigadistas' belief in accepting their environment and households as places of multiple interspecies encounters. This ethnographic study\u2014which draws on the empirical example of community health in urban Nicaragua\u2014not only reveals why the call for more rigorous advertisements, education strategies and \u2018more science' is doomed to failure, but also describes how interspecies entanglements challenge scientific attempts at rationally ordering urban environments. It suggests that urban nature is the setting of the entangled relationship of mosquitoes and humans. However, the concept of entanglement does not necessarily allow us to locate or confine infectious disease risks within urban environments. Rather, the city here is depicted as vicissitudinous, as an open landscape and a community shaped by the downsizing of public health investment, but otherwise unstable in form or extension. Urban health is therefore closely linked to uneven urban development processes.",

They describe public health intervention strategies in Dar es Salaam as attempts to disentangle the human population from malaria\u2010transmitting mosquitoes (see also Brown and Kelly, 2014). Mosquito control is carried out by Community Owned Resource Persons\u2014local residents who are trained to target larval habitats. Larval control strategies aim to identify potential breeding sites and\u2014in some cases\u2014treat them with microbial larvicide. Kelly and Lezaun (2014) identify two different rationales underlying public health intervention strategies. In theory, these strategies aim to disengage mosquitoes from the urban public by mobilizing sanitary images from Tanzania's colonial past. But in practice, the authors argue, larval control seems to focus on urban maintenance and the mobilization of political ideas contrasting with prevalent notions of the function and impact of African governments. The authors emphasize the mobile and shifting nature of the urban fabric: holes, pits, drains, construction sites, sewage ponds, containers, but also fences and private premises, offer numerous breeding sites for the Anopheles mosquito. The mosquito, in turn, has adapted to the rhythms and surfaces of its urban environment. In this approach, the city of Dar es Salaam is depicted in terms of contingency, cohabitation and flexibility. As the city's surfaces shift and evolve, so do the political, social and moral dimensions of city life that have an impact on both insects and humans. The city and its rural hinterland are organized through a malaria geography, thereby questioning dichotomous constructions of disease\u2010free and disease\u2010ridden areas: boundaries are porous, cities are expansive and urban dwellers are characterized by their increased vulnerability to vector\u2010borne diseases (compared to their rural counterparts).

Boundaries matter in urban health research, as I will argue in the next section of this article. They are particularly relevant for the identification and location of disease risks in specific environments and equally important for biomedical concepts of infection as such, as well as for the conception of disease management strategies and the idea of \u2018microbial emergence' itself. Anthropologist Tim Ingold's (2004) reflection on ecological knowledge draws attention to the fact that our conceptions of the environment tend to rely on a hierarchic world order in which places seem to exist within themselves and organisms are independent of their surroundings. Places as territorial mosaics, according to this conception, can only be experienced and known by movements \u2018from place to place'. Ingold (2004) argues for an ecological relationship between organisms (be they human or not) and their environments; however, he proposes conceptualizing this relationship as mutual and emerging when he writes, \u2018In short, organisms no more interact with the environment than do individuals with society. Rather, ecological relations\u2014like social relations\u2014are the lines along which organisms\u2010persons, through their process of growth, are mutually implicated into each other's coming into being' (Ingold, 2004: 306; see also Ingold, 2000). If we are to take this argument seriously, then pathogens\u2014and other organisms\u2014 do not spread along the lines of a pre\u2010existing global order; rather, pathogens themselves and the technologies invented to manage them co\u2010produce new global orders and new environments. Similarly, a number of scholars (Star, 1991; Tsing, 1995; Franklin, 2007; Haraway, 2008; Paxson, 2008) have argued for the social and conceptual inclusion of other species in order to promote a richer understanding of human health, ecological niches and development, and biodiversity. In her ethnographic work on environmental conflicts in Indonesia, multispecies scholar Anna Tsing (2005) rightfully claims to analyse global connections (ecological activism, global health movements, healthy city projects) from the inside and to move beyond generalized assumptions about local knowledge, freedom, transnational politics and humanism. By studying a broad range of actors, such as village elders, honeybee trees, UN funding agencies and rainforest tourists, Tsing describes how environmental activism is enacted in fragmented and sticky connections. Seen this way, through ethnographically informed research, world\u2010travelling concepts, such as feminism and market rationality (but also risk and infection), are only effective at specific times and places. An understanding of how concepts of nature and environment are invoked in global environmental discourses, Tsing (ibid.: 4) argues, involves an understanding of the creative, unstable, awkward and unequal interconnections across differences. She employs the concept of friction\u2014the sticky grip of encounter\u2014to argue against notions of the homogeneous formations of culture, power and politics created by globalization processes. Tsing (ibid.) promotes the vision of global diversity and multiple global futures, rather than that of bringing about a culturally and biologically uniform world. Concepts such as friction enable us to rethink nature, environments and the biological beings that inhabit them as being in a permanent process of formation and becoming. They also enable us to understand the frameworks needed to make a universal knowledge of nature effective and true, and to thoroughly understand material and symbolic gaps that hinder powerful demarcations\u2014such as nature/culture and human/non\u2010human binaries\u2014from travelling well.",

In light of these approaches, it seems doubtful that disease risks can be located in specific features of the urban environment (see also Brown and Kelly, 2014).

As discussed above, viruses and other microbial agents are material\u2010symbolic representatives of an emerging and uncontrollable nature. In this context, some pathogens (such as H5N1, anthrax, and MERS\u2010CoV\u2014Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus) have come under scrutiny: their routes of transmission and their genetic makeup have been analysed, they have been politicized, and they are embedded in transnational surveillance systems. When an emerging virus arrives in the city, it represents \u2018matter out of place' (Douglas, 1966) and elicits a wide range of biomedical and sociotechnical countermeasures, mirrored by the escalating response schemes of pandemic preparedness. Other pathogens, however, pass unnoticed as they are neither classified as emerging, nor are they diagnosed or made visible to surveillance systems (for example, Trypanosoma cruzi or Mycobacterium ulcerans). Paradoxically, global networks simultaneously serve as threat and solution (Wald, 2008: 8). Intensified global flows of people, microbes, consumer goods, traffic and transport\u2014connecting other organisms and other places to the bodies of urban residents\u2014pose a massive threat to urban health, while they also create transnational collaborations, surveillance networks and the exchange of expertise and experts. The spatial dimensions of prevention and disease management in mobile fields present a number of challenges to scholars working within urban health contexts. When compared to (1) biocultural; and (2) multispecies perspectives on urban infections, network approaches tend to stress the relational character of infectious diseases, their topological dimensions and their translation into the domains of biosecurity. The establishment, maintenance, circumvention and erosion of territorial borders are of key importance to these approaches. Their empirical focus is on those pathogens that are highly visible (often airborne viruses) and considered to be of global significance\u2014although, as critical approaches claim, the implementation of networked disease management technologies mainly meets the needs of Western states (Fidler, 2003; Davies, 2008; Washer, 2014).",

In her analysis of the activities of the Team Clean task force, a hygiene initiative, she pays close attention to the spatial dimensions of infectious disease management. According to internationally articulated objectives, the urban space of Hong Kong is categorized into high\u2010risk and low\u2010risk zones, with far\u2010reaching consequences for their inhabitants. Whereas the residents of Amoy Gardens, a large and \u2018high\u2010risk' apartment complex, had to face severe hygienic interventions such as quarantine and confinement, highly mobile but \u2018low\u2010risk' international elites by contrast subverted restrictions. Giving empirical priority to representational features of the securitization paradigm places emphasis on educational messages, the visualization of risk, and the mapping of individual cases (but less so on individual agency, experiences or limitations). Roloff's (2007) study makes it apparent that globalized and non\u2010territorial threats such as SARS and avian flu challenge traditional concepts of urban space and its governance. As architectural historian Ben Campkin and geographer Rosie Cox (Campkin and Cox, 2007: 1) note, the spatialities of dirt and contamination (which are of major importance in the conception of hygienic interventions) might be made visible by reflecting on concepts and practices of cleaning and cleanliness. Thus, notions of blame and responsibility find a resonance in hierarchies of cleanliness and health (see also Aasgard Jansen, 2013). Roloff's work stresses the city's representational character\u2014it is here where local, regional, national and international governance processes overlap and are decided, mirroring international and powerful fears of emerging pathogens.

Based on fieldwork performed in Hong Kong, Keck (2010) describes how the emergence of SARS seemed to confirm the hypothesis that new viruses originate in South China's ecology (which is characterized by close proximity of different species) and that they use Hong Kong as a point of transmission to spread globally. Keck draws on analogies between bioterrorists and pandemic threats to sketch how Hong Kong became a sentinel for avian flu and a biosecurity hotspot. Whereas many scholars of the existing literature on biosecurity make use of Foucault's notion of biopower, Keck understands biosecurity measures as the outcome of specific human\u2013animal interactions. In his understanding, animals (being an important part of the chain of transmission) and their immune systems are transformed into sentinels for the emergence of pandemic flu viruses and therefore contribute to attempts to modernize Hong Kong into a bulwark of disease control. Hong Kong is portrayed as \u2018a place where live poultry is produced, exchanged, and consumed, or as a city where nature is at the same time controlled and proliferating' (2011b: 57). Thus, urban and rural environments do not represent a dialectical order, but are entangled and share certain characteristics (such as poultry consumption patterns). In this account, the city of Hong Kong embraces three functions: a sentinel post, a gateway to the distribution of agricultural and other products, and a sensitive border territory to the city's rural hinterlands such as Guangdong province. This account is instructive, as it captures multiple connections without squeezing them into linear and static networks.",

The Egyptian government targeted backyard and rooftop poultry as the main risk factors contributing to the spread of the virus. Suddenly the \u2018sights, smells, and noises of poultry' (ibid.: 1545) not only meant an unwanted disruption to representations of Egypt as a modern metropolis, but also seemed to pose a major risk to the city's human population. Experts killed and disposed of an estimated 34 million birds. Simultaneously, an agricultural crisis caused by the restructuring of the poultry industry struck the nation and ended in the breakdown of small local economies, food price increases and the proliferation of small\u2010scale husbandry. When put together, these efforts resulted in food shortages and chaotic attempts to hide seemingly healthy chickens and ducks or to bring infected birds onto the market. In their critical approach, Hinchliffe and Bingham (ibid.) attempt to question the interaction of various disease and security ecologies in Egypt. They conclude that while some of the security measures (such as culling) may succeed in minimizing the number of potential hosts, the same measures also create new risks and new viral niches (such as numerous dead or hidden animals). To realize the dynamic and topological nature of biosecurity networks, referred to as \u2018netwars', they argue that one has to take into account their multiple interferences, adaptabilities and accommodations. Current bio\u2010surveillance approaches underestimate the non\u2010human and build upon \u2018a logic of control and instrumentalism', and thus fail to adapt to the indeterminate nature of networks (ibid.: 1547).

Cities are made up of moving and emerging forces, of multiplicity, symbioses, little things and change, many of which escape the attempt to grasp them in encompassing concepts and controlling mechanisms. As a result, cities resist the Foucauldian panoptic gaze (Foucault, 1977) and possess an experimental nature. Amin and Thrift (2002) cite the work of Luhmann (1998) on ecologies of ignorance, arguing that \u2018the city is a complex imbroglio of actors with different goals, methods and ways of practice. Then, precisely because of this complexity, the city can never be wholly fathomed. There always remain parts that can never be reached \u2026 gaps, blind spots, mistakes, unreliable paradoxes, ambiguities, anomalies, invisibilities' (Amin and Thrift, 2002: 92).When taken together, network approaches mostly capture airborne infections and emphasize cities' functions as focal points, gateways, border territories or conduits of disease transmission. Thereby, they point to diverse attempts to govern microbial traffic either through the monitoring and surveillance of pathogens or the regulation of agricultural production and meat consumption, often framed as biosecurity technologies. Cities\u2014based on this understanding\u2014are not only shaped by circulation and flow, but are affected very differently by hierarchical modernization processes. Health is thus drawn into the domain of security and seems to be fundamentally ambiguous: while it results from successful governance practices, it is also portrayed as embedded in flows, and thus eventually not controllable and maybe even transhuman. Such studies of urban complexity and the traversing of organic boundaries make it apparent that anthropological research into global health governance and disease surveillance that is blind to the multitude of flows, bodies and processes contributing to urban life and urban health would quickly lead to a theoretical dead end with limited explanatory value. Conversely, it is not surprising that scalar logics might not be able to capture the complex and relational configurations of urban epidemics.",

A focus on the material impact of urban environments on the health of its inhabitants might reveal a whole new set of questions about the interactions among host, pathogen and environment, and about how urban infections manifest themselves differently in different local contexts. Cities troubled by infectious disease outbreaks do not fall neatly into universal categories of space, modernity or risk; rather, they are produced and formed on a range of social, political, biological and economic sites and scales. Whereas emerging infectious diseases are often portrayed as a \u2018natural' effect of urbanization and globalization processes, critical biosecurity scholars have, however, pointed out that the concept of emergence itself is only enacted within specific analytical frameworks. The three different analytical lenses discussed in this article offer three distinct, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, frameworks for communicating about the complex subject of urban infections. First, biocultural approaches productively blend and analyse biological dynamics, environmental effects and social practice. They present cities as environments, environmental conditions or as habitations, while simultaneously stressing that risks are distributed unequally between and within cities. In these approaches, disease might be understood as the interaction of two distinct entities: environments and the bodies that inhabit them. Second, approaches that focus on urban natures and multispecies entanglements understand other biological actors as essential to urban infectious disease ecologies. While they display the liveliness of cities, they also focus on their unstable and expansive character. Environments are thus never bounded, but entangled and open. Health, as seen through this lens, can only be achieved by living with\u2014and not against\u2014nature. Third, and finally, network approaches display the manifold ways that territorial borders are established, circumvented, maintained, politicized or eroded in infectious disease management. They stress the unbounded nature of urban environments by analysing governance processes. Scholars working in this tradition depict cities as shaped by circulation processes. Circulation processes, in turn, are organized in a hierarchical order. Within this hierarchical order, some pathogens and their urban habitats pass unnoticed, while others are highly visible and believed to be of political significance. Here, health is drawn into the domain of security.",

I will now briefly sketch some methodological and epistemological implications arising from this area of research, as considered from the perspective of cultural anthropology. One of the most striking qualities of urban epidemics is their inherent mobility. Studies of the networked character of infectious disease have shown how these are embedded in topological relations and networks that exceed their geographies. The anthropology of globalization (Tsing, 2005; Collier and Ong, 2008; Lowe, 2008) provides important impulses regarding the exploration of mobile and multi\u2010sited phenomena such as migratory microbes, global health strategies and the circulation of agricultural products. This line of enquiry has shown that the analysis of globalization processes moves beyond an investigation of a growing global interconnectedness. Instead, a reconsideration of analytical categories of space, time, climate or nature\u2014which are of equal importance to both the social sciences and public health\u2014goes hand in hand with accounts that ramify different sites and aim to capture new paths of connection and association.1313 Outbreaks of infectious diseases with pandemic potential put political, ethical and technological pressures on the relationship between science, the market and the geographies of afflicted populations (Collier and Ong, 2008: 18). In order to delineate biosocial territories and connections and to track people, animals, pathogens or things moving through them, anthropology\u2014and other ethnographic sciences\u2014might need to evolve from their former committed localism.",

Steve Hinchliffe, John Allen, Stephanie Lavau, Nick Bingham and Simon Carter (Hinchcliffe et al., 2013) in their multi\u2010sited research suggest understanding parts of the environment as \u2018borderland' in the transformation and rearrangement of infectious spaces. In analysing the topologies of infected life, they argue that infectious diseases cannot be reduced to a simple and fixed geometry, and that biosocial spaces are never pure. Rather, disease is depicted as contingent and dynamic intra\u2010action: health is not threatened by intruding pathogens, but life and pathogens co\u2010evolve. Consequently, as they argue, attempts to separate infected from healthy life are doomed to failure. According to this conception, proximities cease to be well\u2010defined, and cities have to be thought of as \u2018topological landscape[s] of embeddings and disembeddings, where disease registers its presence through the density of its intra\u2010actions' (ibid.: 358). Seen in this light, infectious diseases, as well as cities, cannot be confined within static realities.

In order to understand how urban outbreaks of infectious diseases demonstrate differences and similarities, and to understand how different urban settings enact different forms of health and disease, it might be useful to apply a comparative perspective. At the same time, comparative approaches are subject to their own limitations and challenges. They start with the assumption that it is meaningful to compare two settings along certain dimensions. Thus, it is essential to identify abstract concepts and categories that can be used across different contexts. But, as anthropological research has shown, even apparently common phenomena such as death, menopause, fertility or contagion display tremendous local differences in terms of categorization, definition, treatment and diagnosis, and can only be approached meaningfully as embedded in a particular context. It is therefore doubtful that comparative approaches enable us to discover universal causal explanations\u2014although comparative approaches help us rethink the general applicability of theories and models of urban infections and their shortcomings (see Azarian, 2011).",

Anthropological studies of infectious diseases span a broad range of diverging diseases, geographical contexts and historical eras. They are often grounded in the localities, communities and settings that have been affected by infectious disease outbreaks. They have provided insightful accounts of the interactions between hosts and pathogens within diverging contexts and have often contributed to the understanding of complex disease ecologies and their potential control. Shirley Lindenbaum's (1979) study on kuru, a neurodegenerative condition, in New Guinea is probably one of the most prominent early examples. Anthropological approaches combining macro\u2010 with microsociological perspectives are relevant for understanding how human behaviour affects the transmission of pathogens, either by increasing or limiting the spread (Inhorn and Brown, 2009: 42\u20133).

This is especially relevant to the analysis of infectious disease governance. When taken together, anthropological and geographical approaches might offer a deeper understanding of the social production of infectious spaces and their constitutive practices, policies, materialities and processes. Both depend on sustained empirical analysis and on interpretative theory, both might provide sources for critique and intervention\u2014and both might benefit from an engagement with biotic materialities and processes (see Kirksey and Helmreich, 2010: 8). The implications of biological and medical approaches, and of knowledge regimes for social science studies of human\u2013environmental interactions, need to be taken seriously. As the numerous studies discussed throughout this article suggest, infectious diseases are neither socially constructed, nor natural biological phenomena. Ethnographically trained multispecies scholars underscore the importance of understanding precisely how environmental, social and political dynamics serve to establish and sustain co\u2010evolutionary links between different biological agents such as humans, plants, animals and microbes.

As a locus, cities offer a setting for ethnographic work. Ethnographic work here promises insights into how people experience and construct their environments, how they relate to other people and to animals or microbes, how political discourses are manufactured, and how health and disease are negotiated (see Kleinman and Lee, 2006; Keck, 2011b; Nading, 2012; Kelly and Lezaun, 2014). In turn, to think of urban settings as objects of research means to pay attention to their manifold forms, territories, expressions and dynamics, as well as their relationships with other places (Brenner and Schmid, 2014). A combination of both perspectives might provide useful insights into the interrelationship of urban forms and infectious diseases on different scales and at different sites. It might also help us gain a better grasp of how urban settings relate to other places, commonly referred to as rural, sub\u2010urban or non\u2010urban. Against this backdrop, numerous studies have pointed out the relational character, messiness and complexity of urban infections. The fact that urban disease ecologies and urban natures are messy and entangled means that it is impossible (from a theoretical perspective) to analyse urban health along predetermined categories of biological life or to understand them through abstract notions of their material properties. In addition, as I have shown above, the lives of other biological beings lie firmly within the scope of social science studies. On a conceptual level, empirical research into fluid and processual phenomena helps us rethink the limits of human agency. A focus on messiness might enable us to see things, connections, or nooks in what has always been there. It is noteworthy that the messy nature of urban infectious disease ecologies cannot be abbreviated to what is found in concepts. Some things, however, might remain unknown or unnoticed, maybe even unknowable.

Accordingly, it might prove beneficial to ask how the surveillance, anticipation, visualization, politicization and management of infectious disease risks came to choose urban environments as one of their major targets. Critical biosecurity approaches analyse how infectious disease risks are enacted within complex assemblages of sociotechnical infrastructures, biomedical knowledge, different biological organisms and policies. Practices and technologies of emergency and resilience planning are performed, functioning as new tools of urban governance, and new areas of intervention emerge.
