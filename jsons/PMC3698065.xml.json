However, pooling donors increases the risks of transmission of infectious diseases. To reduce this risk, multiple pathogen inactivation methods are used, such as solvent/detergent (SD) treatment, methylene blue (MB), ultraviolet light with riboflavin, and psoralens (amotosalen). SD-FFP inactivates enveloped virus but has no effect on hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. SD-FFP also seems to reduce HLA concentrations and bioactive lipids, which could lead to fewer immunologic adverse effects [8].",

Prestorage leucocyte depletion has been shown to prevent TRIM [16]. Nevertheless, in vitro studies have revealed that even leuco-depleted plasma increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukine-10 (IL-10) after transfusion [17]. One might hypothesize that this is due to the freezing process, which ruptures the cell walls in the remaining WBC, as leukoreduction leaves < 1\u00d7106 WBC/unit. Other studies also have described the different effects of filtration of interleukins, histamine, and TNF in filtrated blood components [18].

Thromboelastography, a recently incorporated method into ICU clinical practice, is performed with whole blood. It assesses the viscoelastic property of clot formation under low shear condition [41]. Thromboelastography-based algorithms reduce both transfusion requirements and blood loss in massively bleeding patients [42].
