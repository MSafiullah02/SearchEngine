For many of these urgent procedures, such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion, laparoscopy may offer the best surgical approach and outcomes for the patient. However, some have suggested that laparoscopic procedures should be avoided, and laparotomy procedures be universally employed when a patient is COVID-19 positive or status is unknown due to concerns about aerosolization of viral particles via the pneumoperitoneum. We strongly disagree with this premise. Based on best available evidence, we concur with both the recent U.S. joint professional society statement on minimally invasive gynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic (1) as well as the European joint society statements (2) endorsing laparoscopy as a safe surgical approach in this setting.",

General anesthesia is not contraindicated in COVID-19 confirmed patients, but the surgical team should minimize exposure to airborne virus during intubation and extubation and OR personnel should don adequate PPE including face shields, N95 filtered masks if available, gowns and gloves. Even if it is assumed that limited viral particles may become airborne via pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy, the operating room is one of the safest places in the hospital to avoid COVID-19 exposure, given the air filtration/circulation in most standard ORs, the sterile field, and surgeons and anesthesiologist will be wearing PPE.",

            "text": "Several techniques can be used to minimize the potential risk of airborne viral particles at the time of surgery via any route, and specifically during laparoscopy. Performing laparoscopy with lower intraabdominal CO2 pressures and minimizing the use of energy will limit the production of surgical plume and pneumoperitoneum. Additionally, the use of a smoke evacuation/filtration system allows for controlled release and filtration of the surgical plume. Ideally, gas and plume evacuation and filtration is accomplished with the use of ultralow particulate air filter (ULPA) rated to screen particles of 0.1 micron in diameter (e.g., the ConMed Airseal or Stryker Pneumoseal). In contrast, high efficiency air filters (HEPA) are only required to filter particles of 0.3 micron in diameter. Of note, N95 masks are rated to filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles. (3) While smoke evacuation and filtration systems can be used both at the time of laparoscopy and laparotomy, laparoscopy offers the unique advantage of being able to almost entirely contain the surgical plume in the abdominal cavity. In conjunction with tightly fitting laparoscopic ports, an evacuation/filtration system can be used to minimize release of potential airborne virus into the operating room environment, while simultaneously evacuating the surgical smoke actively or passively. It is important to avoid sudden release of the pneumoperitoneum. This is most relevant prior to tissue extraction, whether via a minilaparotomy or vaginally, and at the completion of the surgery. At these times, the abdominal cavity should be actively desufflated through a filtration system or with a simple piece of tubing attached to a suction canister, rather than releasing the pneumoperitoneum into the operating room. Use of a containment bag for tissue extraction can help maintain seal and may limit loss of pneumoperitoneum. This is in contrast to smoke evacuation at the time of laparotomy, where containment of the surgical smoke is challenging, if not impossible. The smoke evacuator must ideally be within 2 cm of the source, with 50% loss of capture for every 1 cm from the source of the plume. If COVID-19 particles can indeed be disseminated into the surgical plume, then surgeons and OR personnel may be more likely to experience direct exposure to viral particles from a laparotomy approach.",

We believe laparoscopy offers the opportunity for better containment and filtration of the surgical gas and plume compared with laparotomy, and continues to offer vastly more health benefits, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic and when precious PPE and hospital resources as well as minimizing viral exposure risks are so critical to mitigating this public health crisis. Let's not lose sight of the \"scope\" of the problem: it is imprudent, and even dangerous, to blindly abandon tried-and-true, safe surgical practices during a viral pandemic.
