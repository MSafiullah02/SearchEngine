            "text": "Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 is a serine/threonine kinase consisting of two highly similar paralogs, GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2. With more than 40 definitely identified targets and more than 500 proposed candidate substrates, GSK3 is involved in the regulation of a plethora of intracellular/molecular, organic/cellular, and (patho-)physiological events [1]. For instance, GSK3 has an influence on transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing [2,3], and mRNA stability [4]. On the protein level, GSK3 affects translation and protein synthesis [5,6], protein activity, localization, and degradation [7] (including its participation in the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex [8]). Metabolic processes, such as glucose metabolism [7], lipid deposition [9] and accumulation [10], and processes associated with mitochondrial activity (biogenesis, bioenergetics, permeability, and motility [11]), are influenced by GSK3. In consequence, relevant cellular functions are governed by GSK3. These include proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, [1], adhesion, and migration [12]. Amongst others, GSK3 is of importance for physiological processes, such as embryonic and tissue development [1,7], tumor suppression [13], innate and adaptive immune responses [14], a variety of neuronal functions, and circadian rhythm regulation [12].",

            "text": "GSK3 protein was initially purified in 1980 from rabbit skeletal muscle and characterized as an enzyme activating adenosine triphosphate/magnesium-dependent protein phosphatase [23,24] and phosphorylating glycogen synthase (GS) [25,26], thus inhibiting its activity and negatively controlling the final step of glycogen synthesis [6]. In 1990, nucleotide sequence analysis of a rat brain cDNA library revealed the existence of two highly similar GSK3 paralogs termed \u03b1 and \u03b2 [27] and further analyses led to the identification of two GSK3\u03b2 splice variants (GSK3\u03b21 and 2; see Section 2.2.1.) [28]. Due to their remarkable homology (see Section 2.2.1.), most GSK3-targeting small molecule inhibitors address the ATP binding pocket of both GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2, rendering their selective inhibition a persistent challenge [12]. However, due to the presence of a single amino acid (aa) exchange between \u03b1 and \u03b2 in the ATP binding pocket within the kinase domain (GSK3\u03b1-Glu196 \u2192 GSK3\u03b2-Asp133), the development of paralog-selective inhibitors has been reported recently (GSK3\u03b1: BRD0705, GSK3\u03b2: BRD3731) [29]. Though highly similar, GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2 are differentially regulated and expressed, exhibit tissue-specific expression profiles/levels (see Section 2.2.), have common as well as distinct substrates and cellular functions, and cannot replace each other completely [12]. Moreover, the loss of one paralog does not result in an enhanced expression or activity of the remaining gene/protein [30].",

GSK3\u03b2 contains a negative regulatory N-terminal domain, the kinase domain including both the ATP binding site and the enzymatically active site, as well as a C-terminal domain also possessing negative regulatory capacity (for details, see Section 2.2.3.). GSK3\u03b1, basically characterized by the same protein structure, contains an extended and glycine-rich N-terminal domain [32,33]. Within the active site, conserved Lys residues (GSK3\u03b1: Lys148 and 149; GSK3\u03b2: Lys85 and 86) are responsible for ATP binding and catalyzing the \u03b3-phosphate transfer to the substrate; thus, local point mutations (GSK3\u03b1: Lys148Arg; GSK3\u03b2: Lys85Arg) have a dominant-negative effect on GSK3 enzymatic activity [34].

            "text": "GSK3 generally targets the consensus aa sequence Ser/Thr1-X1-X2-X3-Ser/Thr2. Though not absolutely required, X1 is often a proline [35]. In dependency of prior phosphorylation (\u201cpriming\u201d) of the C-terminal serine/threonine residue (Ser/Thr2), the primed substrate is able to associate with the positively charged GSK3 substrate binding domain, thus enabling the phosphorylation of the respective substrate at the N-terminal serine or threonine (Ser/Thr1) [12,13,36] with a massively increased efficiency (up to 1000-fold) in comparison to unprimed substrates [32,37]. Though the number of intervening residues is generally three in most substrates, deviating numbers have been described [13]. Moreover, in GSK3 substrates that are subsequently addressed by \u03b2-TrCP (\u201cF-box containing E3 ligase \u03b2-transducin repeat-containing protein\u201d) for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, a more specific GSK3 recognition sequence, i.e., Asp-Ser-Gly-X-X-Ser, is present [7]. While the initial priming phosphorylation has to be mediated by another kinase, GSK3 is able to perform multiple successive phosphorylation steps at substrates containing a series of adjacent consensus sequences, thus generating its own priming phosphorylation for further phosphorylation events [38]. Only a limited number of substrates (e.g., Jun, avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (Myc), histone H1.5, microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) \u03b2, Tau protein, and p21) may be bound and phosphorylated at specific sites without priming phosphorylation [7,12,39], potentially due to the presence of acidic residues in the C-terminal position [13]. However, this assumption is still controversially discussed [7] and an influence of protein conformation has also been proposed [12]. In addition, other motifs in these proteins may be addressed by GSK3 via the conservative mechanism, as shown for Jun and Tau following Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated priming phosphorylation [35] and C/EBP\u03b2 after extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2-mediated priming [40].",

The human GSK3\u03b1 gene (GSK3A, chromosomal localization: 19q13.2) is expressed as a single mRNA comprising 11 exons with 2193 bases (gene bank accession number: NM_019884.3; average G/C content: 61%), including a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of 137 bases (83% G/C), the protein coding sequence (1452 bases, including stop codon; 61% G/C), and a 3\u2032UTR of 604 bases (58% G/C) [48]. Human GSK3\u03b2 (GSK3B, 3q13.33) is encoded by a total of 12 exons, yielding three variants comprising 7134 (NM_002093.3, transcript variant 1), 7095 (NM_001146156.1, transcript variant 2), and 6982 bases (NM_001354596.1, transcript variant 3).

GSK3\u03b2 protein expression, however, is slightly more restricted; can hardly be detected in human heart, skeletal, and smooth muscles as well as in lung, vagina, and soft tissues; and is most strongly expressed in the brain and neuronal tissue [54]. Moreover, in many tissues, a remarkable discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels can be observed [46,54], an effect that may be ascribed to differentially regulated and paralog-specific transcriptional and translational events [46]. However, in GSK3-expressing cells/tissues, its expression levels remain relatively stable and only a limited number of cellular conditions appear to exist in which GSK3 expression is significantly regulated [13], including murine brain development [55] and maturation of murine Th17 lymphocytes [56]. GSK3 mRNA amounts may be adjusted by mRNA stability-modifying proteins, such as human antigen R [57].",

            "text": "GSK3 paralogs show distinct patterns of intracellular distribution [12]. GSK3\u03b1, though in principle capable of nuclear translocation, is virtually exclusively located in the cytosol due to its fast export from the nucleus [63]. GSK3\u03b2 is also mainly a cytoplasmic protein but nonetheless well detectable in both the nucleus and mitochondria [64] and at further membrane compartments, such as endosomes and lysosomes [65]. However, an aberrant accumulation of active GSK3\u03b2 has been described in several cancer cells [19]. A 19 aa comprising nuclear localization sequence (NLS) has been described to be present in a basic loop (aa 85\u2013123) within the kinase domain. To ensure cytoplasmic localization, the NLS is sequestered by cytosolic protein complexes [66]. Interestingly, the amount of active GSK3\u03b2 is significantly higher in the extra-cytoplasmic areas (5- to 8-fold) [64]. Intracellular localization is controlled at different regulatory levels [12]. These include (de-)phosphorylation [67], association with proteins facilitating nuclear import (e.g., karyopherin \u03b22 [68] or herpesvirus-derived latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) [69]) or export (e.g., GSK3-binding protein [70]), and partial digestion (see Section 2.2.3.). Recently, it has been shown that inactivation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), mechanistic target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) 1 axis results in the nuclear accumulation of both GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2. In contrast, active PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 favors the retention of GSK3\u03b2 in the cytosol, including (partial) localization at endomembrane compartments [65].",

The presence of an activating phosphorylation at Tyr279 (GSK3\u03b1) and Tyr216 (GSK3\u03b2) is assumed to be necessary for proper formation of the catalytic domain during protein folding [39] and has been demonstrated to significantly facilitate substrate accessibility [71], to increase GSK3 protein stability [72], and to be essential for maximum enzymatic activity [73,74], thus increasing its catalytic capacity (approximately 5-fold, [75]). However, replacing this tyrosine by phenylalanine via in vitro mutagenesis had only little effects on GSK3 activity [34,75,76], indicating that Tyr279/216 phosphorylation is not an indispensable prerequisite for basal enzymatic activity. Moreover, these sites are prone to auto-phosphorylation [72,77] and are already phosphorylated following translation during heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)-dependent protein folding, thus directly yielding active enzymes [13,78]. The tyrosine protein kinases src, fyn, and Pyk2 may further contribute to Tyr279/216 phosphorylation [79]. Though Tyr279/216 phosphorylation proved to be very stable [72], it can be dynamically regulated under certain conditions as demonstrated in models of neurodegeneration [7,80]. Decreased GSK3 activity is associated with reduced tyrosine phosphorylation under various conditions and thus, a regulatory role for phospho-tyrosine phosphatases has been proposed [13].",

            "text": "However, the major regulatory influence on GSK3 is mediated via inhibitory events, mainly in response to a variety of stimulating agents (e.g., insulin, serum, growth factors), leading to the fast reduction of enzymatic activity (30%\u201370% within 10 min) [12]. At the molecular level, this is predominantly mediated via inhibitory phosphorylation at different residues mainly located in the N-terminal region [79]. Among these, Ser21 and Ser9 are regarded as the most important regulatory sites in GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2 [39,79] due to the function of the N-terminal protein domain as a pseudo-substrate [6]. This feature results from the interaction of phosphorylated Ser21/9 with three highly conserved basic residues [81] located within the priming phosphate binding site (GSK3\u03b1: Arg159, Arg243, and Lys268; GSK3\u03b2: Arg96, Arg180, and Lys205 [34,71,74,82]) blocking both the primed substrate binding and the catalytic domain [6]. Thus, Ser21/9 phosphorylation is sufficient for overriding Tyr279/216 phosphorylation-dependent GSK3 activation [80]. This mechanism also opens the possibility that phosphorylation of the few unprimed GSK3 substrates may not be negatively affected by Ser21/9 phosphorylation [39].",

In mice, an additional dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation at Thr356 has been described [85], which still has to be established in humans. The respective sites are targeted by several kinases upon stimulation with multiple factors [39,79]. Ser21 and/or Ser9, for instance, can be phosphorylated by protein kinases A (PKA) in response to cAMP-inducing agents (e.g., forskolin or isoproterenol) and cAMP analogues [86], PKB/Akt (induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [87], interferon (IFN) \u03b2 [88], growth factors, insulin [89], and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [90]), and various protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (including \u03b1, \u03b2II, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b7 [91], e.g., induced by TNF [92], phorbol esters, and via the Wnt (\u201cwingless-type MMTV integration site family member\u201d) pathway [93]). Moreover, these residues may be triggered by p38-MAPK (in response to IL-13) [94], serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase [95], and both subfamilies of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p90-RSK and p70-S6K, induced by growth factors) [39]. Interestingly, a Ser21/9 phosphorylation-independent mechanism of GSK3 inactivation in response to Wnt signaling has also been described [96], presumably involving GSK3 localization and restriction of substrate accessibility [7,97]. GSK3\u03b2-Ser147 phosphorylation is induced by Wnt signaling via PKC\u03b6 [83], Thr43 phosphorylation by growth factors via ERK [84], and Thr390 in response to cellular stress or Wnt proteins via p38 [98].",

Lysine acetylation has been shown to have a negative regulatory influence on GSK3 kinase activity in general. For instance, acetylation of GSK3\u03b1-Lys246 and GSK3\u03b2-Lys183 appears to hinder ATP binding [106]. Accordingly, deacetylases of the sirtuin (SIRT) family contribute to the activation of GSK3\u03b2, e.g., via deacetylation of Lys183 by SIRT2 [106] or Lys205 by SIRT1 [107] and 3 [108]. ADP-ribosyltransferase ARTD10-mediated mono-ADP-ribosylation also leads to an inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 activity [109], whereas removal of ADP-ribose by mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase macrodomain protein MacroD2 restores its activity [110]. GSK3\u03b2 Lys292-SUMOylation appears to be required for its stability, kinase activity, and nuclear localization [111] and peptidyl-deiminase 4-mediated citrullination also supports its nuclear translocation [112]. Using high-throughput approaches, further post-translational modifications have been found in both GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2, including ubiquitination at multiple sites [113] and methylation of GSK3\u03b1-Arg16 [114] or GSK3\u03b2-Lys27 [115].",

The inhibitory effects of Ser21/Ser9 phosphorylation, for instance, can be countered by matrix metalloprotease (MMP-)2 [118] or calpain-driven N-terminal cleavage of GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2, generating remarkably truncated but enzymatically active protein variants (MMP-2: GSK3\u03b2: 30 kDa; calpain: GSK3\u03b1: 42 and 30 kDa, GSK3\u03b2: 40 and 30 kDa) [116]. Further analyses revealed that residues Thr38-Thr39 and Ile384-Gln385 are the relevant calpain cleavage sites in GSK3\u03b2 resulting in the formation of the fragments \u0394N-GSK3\u03b2 (aa 39\u2013420), \u0394C-GSK3\u03b2 (aa 1\u2013384), and \u0394N/\u0394C-GSK3\u03b2 (aa 39\u2013384, i.e., the most active form). The remaining (non-catalytic) C-terminus, however, appears to be essential for GSK3 enzymatic activity, since it was demonstrated in deletion experiments that the absence of aa 417\u2013430 in GSK3\u03b1 or aa 345\u2013367 in GSK3\u03b2 yields a virtually complete loss of both Tyr279/216 auto-phosphorylation and substrate (e.g., Tau) phosphorylation [34].",

In the case of GSK3\u03b1, the N-terminal region further appears to be responsible for its fast and efficient export from the nucleus, since N-terminal binding of specific calcium/calpain-sensitive interaction partner(s) or deletion of the N-terminus resulted in nuclear accumulation of GSK3\u03b1 [63]. For GSK3\u03b2, it has been shown that the presence of the N-terminal part is necessary for the interaction with certain proteins, e.g., PKB/Akt, p53, or the 14\u20133-3\u03b6 adapter protein [120].",

It is well established that enzymatically active GSK3 acts as a crucial positive regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, interleukin (IL-)1\u03b2, IL-6 [15], IL-17, IL-18 [122], IL-23 [94], IL-12, IFN-\u03b3 [17]), chemokines (IL-8 [122], C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 2 [17], 3, 4 [123], and 12, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 1, 2, 5 [17], and 10 [124]), and further pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., nitric oxide (NO) [125] or prostaglandin E2 [126]). Vice versa, anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 [127], IL-10 [90], IL-22 [128], IL-33 [129], and IL-1 receptor antagonist [130], are negatively regulated by GSK3. Interestingly, GSK3 has also been linked to anti-inflammatory action leading to the termination of inflammatory events (see Section 3.2.). As a reflection of the impact of GSK3\u03b2 on inflammatory diseases, the application of the GSK3\u03b2 activity index (i.e., the ratio of total to Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3\u03b2) has been proposed as a new diagnostic and prediction tool [131,132].

            "text": "In contrast to GSK3\u03b1, GSK3\u03b2 KO proved to be lethal in the late phase of murine embryogenesis [12]. The respective mice are characterized by a variety of cellular and organ defects, including liver degeneration induced by TNF-hypersensitivity-related apoptosis of hepatocytes [137] and severe cardiac defects resulting from impaired cardiomyocyte differentiation [138]. Since the premature death of KO individuals impedes the analysis of GSK3\u03b2 functions, several conditional, tissue-specific GSK3\u03b2 KO models have been generated. Though not predominantly characterized by alterations of the immune system or in host defense, some aspects of conditional KO may also have an impact on inflammatory processes (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, or TF activation). A myeloid cell-specific GSK3\u03b2 KO, for instance, led to liver tissue/hepatocellular protection as well as diminished pro- (TNF, IL-6, CXCL10, neutrophil infiltration/activation) and enhanced anti-inflammatory responses (IL-10) in a murine model of ischemia-reperfusion injuries [139]. GSK3\u03b2 KO in the renal proximal tubule proved to be protective against mortality and tubular injury due to rapid tissue regeneration as reflected by reduced apoptosis in the renal cortex and accelerated proliferation of renal proximal tubule cells in a mercury chloride-induced acute nephrotoxic injury model [140]. In murine experimental adriamycin nephropathy [141] and oxidative glomerular injury [142], podocyte-specific GSK3\u03b2 KO significantly decreased podocyte loss and injury, reduced glomerular damage, attenuated proteinuria [141,142], and reduced glomerular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, the latter presumably due to an increase in the antioxidant genes, inducing nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 [142,143]. The respective podocytes were characterized by increased glycogen accumulation [142] as well as preserved cytoskeleton integrity and focal adhesions, reduced mitochondria dysfunction, and diminished pro-inflammatory nuclear factor (NF-)\u03baB activation [141]. Anti-apoptotic effects of GSK3\u03b2 deficiency have also been observed in murine GSK3\u03b2 KO oligodendrocytes that are protected from caspase-dependent (but not -independent) apoptosis [144]. Moreover, in heterozygous GSK3\u03b2+/- mice exhibiting Pam3CSK4-induced peritonitis, the extent of inflammation was significantly lower than in the wildtype and equivalent results have been obtained in chimeric mice possessing GSK3\u03b2 KO hematopoietic cells [145]. In summary, these data indicate that GSK3\u03b2 indeed plays an essential role in controlling cellular functions contributing to initiation or resolution of inflammation (see also Section 3.2.).",

            "text": "The influence of GSK3 on inflammatory events has also been studied in a number of animal models focusing on inflammatory diseases. For instance, in a murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor TDZD-8 led to significantly reduced joint inflammation and destruction as reflected by reduced edema formation and histological joint alterations/bone resorption, decreased numbers of circulating leukocytes and infiltrating neutrophils as well as lower levels of TNF, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1\u03b1 and 2, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [146]. In another murine CIA model, GSK3 inhibitors reduced hind paw erythema and swelling, pannus formation, infiltration of macrophages and T-cells, and bone erosion. Inhibitor-treated CIA mice also showed decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, e.g., TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 [147]. In a collagen antibody-induced arthritis model, GSK3 inhibition using LiCl also reduced joint swelling [145]. Likewise, treatment with LiCl resulted in an amelioration of peritonitis in a murine Pam3CSK4-induced peritonitis model [145]. In mice with peptidoglycan (PGN)-induced peritonitis, anti-inflammatory effects (increased IL-10, decreased TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) could be elicited by ephedrine hydrochloride (EH), a substance that inhibits GSK3\u03b2 via the PI3K-Akt axis in cell culture experiments [148] (see Section 3.1.3.). In a rat model of ischemic stroke, the application of GSK3 inhibitor VIII significantly reduced infarct volume, brain swelling, and neutrophil infiltration as well as signs of apoptosis (caspase-3 activation) and inflammation (COX-2 amounts; number of astrocytes, monocytes, and macrophages) [149]. In comparison to WT mice, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) KO mice are characterized by significantly attenuated inflammation (i.e., decreased amounts of TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, CCL2, 3, and CXCL10; reduced numbers of infiltrating immune cells in the liver) following the induction of fulminant hepatitis using Concanavalin A injection. In that case, PTPRO KO was associated with increased PI3K/Akt activation and significantly elevated GSK3\u03b2-Ser9 phosphorylation [150].",

The injection of GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 during ischemia prevented the occurrence of inflammatory symptoms [151]. (Neuro)-inflammation is also a symptom observed upon hypoxic-ischemic injury.

Under the same conditions, comparable results have been obtained in the liver of normal mice treated with a zinc chelator [153]. In contrast, SB216763-treated diabetic WT mice and cardiac-specific metallothionein-overexpressing transgenic mice (which are protected from diabetes-associated cardiomyopathy) showed neither GSK3\u03b2 activation nor significant symptoms of cardiac inflammation [154]. In an alternative streptozotocin-induced diabetes model, elevated levels of GSK3\u03b2 were accompanied with increased TNF, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels in the hippocampus. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression could be ameliorated by application of Boswellia serrate extract, a polyphenol-rich substance also reducing hippocampal GSK3\u03b2 expression [155]. Decreased GSK3\u03b2-Ser9 phosphorylation, increased TNF, IL-6, COX-2, and iNOS expression, and the abolishment of these effects by SB216763 can also be observed in the hippocampi of rats with diabetes induced by a combination of a high-fat diet and low streptozotocin concentrations [156].",

In LPS-treated murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells and primary murine macrophages, preceding TLR2 stimulation by recombinant leucine-responsive regulatory protein preincubation results in PI3K/Akt activation, GSK3\u03b2-Ser9 phosphorylation, reduced NF-\u03baB activity/nuclear translocation, and suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and -12 expression [160]. In LPS-challenged human monocytes, it was shown that Akt-dependent GSK3 inactivation may be supported by additional mTORC2-dependent activation of Akt as well as (mTORC1-dependent) activation of GSK3\u03b2-Ser9-targeting S6K [161]. The application of GSK3 inhibitors protected mice from endotoxin shock [90] and enhanced the survival of Burkholderia pseudomallei-infected mice [162]. The increase in IL-10 via CREB due to Akt-mediated GSK3\u03b2 inactivation has also been demonstrated in murine macrophages in response to Francisella tularensis (FT) [163] and in murine and human macrophages in response to Leishmania donovani (LD) infection [164]. Furthermore, increased IL-10 and decreased IL-6 production due to Ser9-dependent GSK3\u03b2 inactivation has been observed in PGN-treated primary murine peritoneal macrophages and RAW cells following EH application [148].

In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-)1-infected T- and monocytic cell lines, upregulated GSK3\u03b2 expression has been observed in both the cytoplasm and (to a lesser extent) the nucleus [169]. It has also been demonstrated that coxsackievirus B3 infection upregulated GSK3\u03b2 levels in a mouse model [170] and increased the activity of GSK3\u03b2 in HeLa cells, resulting in reduced \u03b2-catenin amounts, infection-associated cytopathic effects, and apoptosis as well as increased viral progeny release, effects that could be blocked by GSK3 inhibition [171]. Furthermore, GSK3\u03b2 inhibition considerably reduces viral replication in HIV-1-infected macrophages or cell lines [169,172] and Varicella zoster virus-infected human MeWo melanoma cells [173]. In hepatitis C virus (HCV)-treated human hepatocarcinoma Huh7.5 cells, GSK3 inhibitors prevented the release of HCV virions, while viral replication was not affected [174]. Another group found that GSK3\u03b2 (but not GSK3\u03b1) inhibition reduced both replication and viral particle production of HCV but not hepatitis E virus in Huh7.5 cells [175]. Moreover, GSK3-mediated phosphorylation appears to be involved in the destabilization of PHD finger protein 13, a host factor that (amongst other functions) is involved in repressing HIV-1 [176] and human cytomegalovirus gene expression [177]. Direct GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2-dependent phosphorylation of the coronavirus (CoV) nucelocapsid (N) has been described to be of importance for viral expansion, since GSK3 inhibition reduces both CoV-N phosphorylation and CoV replication [178].",

Following promising preclinical and phase I clinical results in terms of pharmacokinetics, metabolism, excretion [199], and efficacy (in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin) against advanced solid tumors [200], a phase II study showed no significant clinical effects of LY2090314 as a single agent in acute myeloid leukemia treatment, thus limiting its benefit [201]. Other components, such as AZD1080, were analyzed in phase I trials [202] but discontinued in development [195]. Chiefly, problems with this type of drug may be attributed to two major issues, i.e., a common lack of specificity combined with a frequently occurring toxicity [195]. However, even ATP competitors are still regarded as potential pharmaceutical agents. 9-ING-41, for instance, is a malmeimide-derived GSK3 inhibitor that initially showed potent anti-proliferative activity [203] and capacity to overcome chemoresistance [204] in different cancer cell lines.

Initially, it has been demonstrated that TNF-induced NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity and transactivation of NF-\u03baB-dependent promoter constructs were significantly reduced in murine GSK3\u03b2 KO fibroblasts, effects that could be reversed by transient transfection of rat GSK3\u03b2. Interestingly, under these circumstances, I\u03baB degradation and nuclear p65 translocation were not affected [137]. GSK3 inhibition [219] or genetic deletion [220] also had no effect on I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, IKK activation, or p65 translocation and it has been proposed that direct p65 phosphorylation may play a decisive role in that context (see below) [219]. In addition, during GSK3 inactivation, the increasing \u03b2-catenin levels appear to further enhance NF-\u03baB suppression, since \u03b2-catenin has been shown to directly interact with protein complexes that include p65- and/or p50-containing NF-\u03baB dimers and to reduce NF-\u03baB DNA binding and subsequent functions (i.e., transactivation activity and target gene expression) in this way [221].",

In TNF-stimulated WT endothelial cells, a rapid transient (i.e., 5\u201310 min following stimulation) activation of GSK3 has been observed, an effect associated with IKK\u03b2 activation, I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, enhanced DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB, and the formation of a pro-inflammatory phenotype [223]. The influence of long-term TNF incubation on GSK3 activity, however, has not been comprehensively addressed yet (see also Section 3.2.4.). Other studies demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 activity contributes to the activation of several NF-\u03baB-dependent genes following TNF stimulation by enhancing p65 DNA binding activity, while specific subsets of NF-\u03baB-dependent genes (including I\u03baB\u03b1) are not affected [220,224]. Vice versa, at the promoters of certain NF-\u03baB-dependent genes that are suppressed under GSK3\u03b2 inhibiting conditions, either decreased p65 or increased p50 amounts can be detected [224]. This suggests the existence of specific and differentially regulated NF-\u03baB-dependent gene sets and a distinct role for GSK3\u03b2 in the modulation of the NF-\u03baB system(s). This may also be reflected by the identification of a set of growth factor-responsive genes that are suppressed in quiescent cells by GSK3-dependent inhibition of IKK and I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, whereas GSK3 inhibition (either by inhibitors or growth factor stimulation) leads to increased IKK activity, I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation/degradation, nuclear p65/p50 translocation, and binding of p65 to the promoters of several (though not all) of these genes [225]. Thus, GSK3 activation appears to involve an activation of NF-\u03baB and associated signaling molecules in general. However, since single studies report that overexpression of constitutively active GSK3\u03b2 variants significantly reduced stimulus-induced IKK activation, I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity, and/or NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription [226,227], an excess of enzymatically active GSK3\u03b2 also appears to be disadvantageous for the responsiveness of the NF-\u03baB system.",

            "text": "Most of the NF-\u03baB subunits also act as substrates of GSK3. GSK3-dependent phosphorylation has been described for p65 [219] at Thr254 [228], Ser276 [229,230], Ser468 [231,232] (or its murine equivalent Ser467 [230]) and Ser536 [222,233], p105 at Ser903 and 907 [234], p100 at Ser707 [235], and RelB at Ser552 (in the mouse; corresponds to human RelB-Ser573 [236]) [237]. Various functional consequences arise from GSK3-driven NF-\u03baB phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of p65-Thr254 appears to be essential for the transactivation of certain genes as shown for type II collagen expression during chondrocyte differentiation [228]. An increase in GSK3\u03b2-Tyr216 phosphorylation and the Tyr216/Ser9 ratio was associated with enhanced p65-Ser276 phosphorylation, p65-CBP interaction, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF, IL-1\u03b2) [229]. In unstimulated cells, phosphorylation of p65 at Ser468 inhibits its transactivation activity and reactivation may be performed by PP1-mediated dephosphorylation [231]. In stimulated cells, however, p65-Ser468 phosphorylation results in the increased expression of a subset of NF-\u03baB-dependent pro-inflammatory genes, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [230,232]. EGF-stimulated epithelial cells show an activation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway as reflected by increased p65-Ser536 phosphorylation due to the activation of both IKK\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 [233].",

            "text": "The regulation of AP-1 is a crucial step in mediating the expression of a variety of GSK3-dependent genes, making AP-1 an important player within the GSK3-regulated transcriptional network [218]. In general, activation and activity of AP-1 and its subunits Jun, JunB, JunD, Fos, FosB, Fos-related antigen (Fra-)1, and Fra-2 are inhibited by active GSK3. Early, it was shown that GSK3 is able to phosphorylate the DNA binding domain within the C-terminus of Jun in vitro, thus reducing the DNA binding activity of AP-1 consisting of Jun homodimers [211], whereas PKC (i.e., PKC\u03b1, \u03b21, \u03b22, or \u03b3)-mediated GSK3\u03b2 inactivation reduces the negative regulatory Jun phosphorylation [91]. Once phosphorylated by GSK3, Jun family proteins may be ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded via the proteasomal pathway as shown for Jun [241] and JunB [242]. For JunB and D, a similar GSK3-driven regulation of DNA binding activity has been demonstrated [212,213]. However, since JunB/D and Fra-1/2 possess relatively weak transactivation domains, which may render them to AP-1 subunits with predominantly deactivating or repressing features, GSK3-driven regulation of AP-1 is often mediated via its activating subunits, such as Jun [218]. A good example for the regulatory interrelationship during inflammation is the repression of IL-10 via the inhibition of AP-1 (and CREB) following IFN-\u03b3 stimulation of primary human macrophages. In detail, IFN-\u03b3 induced the activation of GSK3, which was associated with a significant suppression of both basal and TLR2-induced fos mRNA and Jun protein levels, lower AP-1 DNA binding activity, and reduced expression of AP-1-dependent genes, such as IL-10 [145]. An alternative possibility to negatively regulate Jun/AP-1 activity is the suppression of JNK activating signal transduction as shown in drosophila [243].",

C/EBP\u03b1 was early identified as a GSK3 substrate phosphorylated at Thr222 and Thr226 (corresponding to human Thr226/230 [236]), i.e., residues that are dephosphorylated by PP1 or 2a during GSK3 inhibition, e.g., in response to insulin [251]. Accordingly, in transgenic mice expressing inactivation-resistant GSK3\u03b1-Ser21Ala and GSK3\u03b2-Ser9Ala variants, C/EBP\u03b1-Thr222/226 phosphorylation was significantly enhanced, while total C/EBP\u03b1 levels were comparable with the WT [252]. Furthermore, it has been described that GSK3 activity is able to induce conformational changes in C/EBP\u03b1 [251]. However, since reduced Thr222/226 phosphorylation could not be detected in insulin-treated hepatocytes, this effect appears to be cell type specific [253]. Moreover, the functional role of these phospho-sites seems to be situation dependent, since no concrete regulatory influence has been observed by in vitro serine-to-alanine mutation in adipocytes [253], whereas these aa exchanges suppressed the induction of metallothionein 2A in murine hepatocytes [254].",

            "text": "An equivalent dephosphorylation following growth hormone-induced GSK3 inactivation has been observed for C/EBP\u03b2 and its isoforms liver-enriched activating protein (LAP, a TF possessing transactivating capacity) and liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP, an inhibitory factor lacking transactivation domains) in murine fibroblasts. In this case, interestingly, LAP DNA binding activity was increased, while LIP binding was decreased, at least at certain C/EBP binding sites, e.g., within the cfos promoter, an effect associated with increased promoter activity [255]. Thus, C/EBP\u03b2 may contribute to the activation of AP-1 under GSK3-inhibiting conditions (see Section 3.1.7.). In murine embryonic fibroblasts and macrophage-like cells, another phosphorylation site at Thr188 (human: Thr235 [236]) has been described that was required for the activation of certain genes, including C/EBP\u03b1, and is sensitive towards GSK3 inhibition [256,257]. Following stimulation of RAW cells with edema toxin (ET), the phosphorylation of C/EBP\u03b2-Thr188 was enhanced and the association of both GSK3\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b2 with the tumor suppressor APC (\u201cadenomatous polyposis coli\u201d, a subunit of the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex [8]) was induced, suggesting that APC may facilitate GSK3-driven C/EBP\u03b2-Thr188 phosphorylation [257]. Further, MAPK-phosphorylated Thr188 may act as a priming site for GSK3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser184 and Ser179, i.e., phospho-residues favoring dimerization due to conformational changes and enhancing both DNA binding and transactivation activity [40,258]. Decreased C/EBP\u03b2-Thr235 phosphorylation due to GSK3 inactivation was detected in TNF long-term-incubated monocytic cells in the presence of kenpaullone [259] as well as human monocyte-derived DC in response to platelet-activating factor [260]. In contrast, in IL-17-stimulated murine ST2 stromal cells, ERK-mediated priming phosphorylation at Thr188 and subsequent phosphorylation at Ser179 by GSK3 have been described as being repressive for certain C/EBP-dependent genes [261]. Equivalent results have been obtained in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) [262]. In differentiated murine preadipocytic 3T3-L1 cells, an O-linked \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine modification at Ser180 or Ser181 prevented C/EBP\u03b2-Thr188, -Ser184, and -Thr179 phosphorylation and decreased its DNA binding and transactivation activities [263]. In rat-derived osteoblasts, a corresponding GSK3\u03b2-dependent phosphorylation at C/EBP\u03b2-Thr189, -Ser185, -Ser181, and -Ser177 was described. In this case, however, stimulation-induced and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG)-dependent GSK3\u03b2 inhibition was associated with C/EBP\u03b2 dephosphorylation, increased DNA binding activity, and enhanced C/EBP\u03b2-dependent reporter gene expression [264], suggesting a differential regulation in the rat when compared to mice and humans. In murine microglial cells, LPS-induced nuclear translocation of C/EBP\u03b2 and \u03b4 was strongly enhanced in the presence of LiCl [265]. Moreover, murine C/EBP\u03b4 has been reported to be phosphorylated by GSK3\u03b2 at Ser167 in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1\u03b2, leading to enhanced C/EBP\u03b4-dependent gene expression [266].",

In prostate cancer cells, for instance, normally low C/EBP\u03b1 protein (but not mRNA) levels massively increased in the presence of GSK3 inhibitors, while the higher C/EBP\u03b2 levels remained unchanged, suggesting that C/EBP\u03b1 protein stability may be affected by GSK3 [267]. Inhibition of GSK3 activity by melatonin treatment led to downregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 and \u03b4 expression in human mesenchymal stem cells [268]. In RAW cells, C/EBP\u03b4 has been shown to be targeted for degradation by Fbxw7\u03b1 following phosphorylation by GSK3\u03b2 at Thr156 and (to a lesser extent) Ser160. GSK3\u03b2 inhibition, in turn, either by inhibitors or LPS-induced Ser9 phosphorylation, enhanced C/EBP\u03b4 protein half-life [269]. In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, however, CEBPD promoter activation and C/EBP\u03b4 levels decreased in the presence of enhanced \u03b2-catenin amounts following GSK3 inactivation [270]. C/EBP\u03b6, aka C/EBP homologous protein (acting as a pro-apoptotic TF), has been described to be upregulated in situations favoring GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 activation, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [271]. Accordingly, expression of the constitutively active GSK3\u03b2-Ser9Ala variant induced C/EBP\u03b6 mRNA and protein levels in primary murine macrophages even under conditions antagonizing ER stress [272]",

The following increase in nuclear CREB resulted in decreased pro-inflammatory NF-\u03baB-p65 DNA binding as well as reduced IL-17 and IL-23 but increased IL-10 expression, i.e., a modified cytokine expression profile favoring amelioration of inflammation [94]. In THP-1 cells challenged with varying doses of LPS, GSK3\u03b2-dependent cytokine expression profiles were differentially modified, suggesting a dose-dependent impact of LPS on the programming of innate immune cells and the resolution of inflammation. In this model, very low LPS doses yielded decreased Akt activity and increased Pyk2-mediated Tyr216 phosphorylation (i.e., activation) of GSK3\u03b2, resulting in elevated expression levels of pro-inflammatory IL-6. At the transcriptional level, an upregulation of TF forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) and a downregulation of CREB protein amounts contribute to the realization of this effect. Following high dose treatment, THP-1 cells showed increased Akt activity (implying GSK3 inhibition), upregulated CREB and downregulated FoxO1 levels (including activating CREB-Ser133 and inhibiting FoxO1-Ser256 phosphorylation), and elevated levels of both IL-6 and anti-inflammatory IL-33 [129].",

            "text": "Interestingly, resolution of inflammation also comprises effects that are rather regarded as pro-inflammatory. For instance, the proper production of ROS has been implicated to be of importance, since p47phox KO resulted in ROS deficiency-associated excessive acute inflammation in different mouse models (including p47phox KO mice and macrophages) following LPS challenge. Mechanistically, this can be attributed to decreased IL-10 levels, which are caused by significantly increased GSK3\u03b2 activation due to reduced PI3K-Akt-dependent GSK3\u03b2-Ser9 phosphorylation in the absence of p47phox [273]. Thus, GSK3 inhibition generally appears to support the resolution of inflammatory processes. Consequently, the application of GSK3 inhibitors (e.g., SB216763, SB415286, TDZD-8 [274], indirubin-3\u2032-monoxime [275], or lithium [145,276]) alleviates symptoms of systemic inflammation in murine and rat inflammatory disease models [121] (see Section 3.1.2.) and equivalent results have been obtained in human cell culture approaches [223].",

These pro-proliferative events supported tissue repair, a process also contributing to the termination of inflammation [280]. An equivalent regulation of GSK3 has been observed in a wounding model using IEC-18 rat epithelial cells [281]. Consistently, wound healing was supported by overexpression of \u03b2-catenin or substances inducing GSK3\u03b2-Ser9 phosphorylation, such as lucidone [282], while GSK3\u03b2 overexpression or PKC inhibition had the opposite effect [280].

The elimination of neutrophils, for instance, which represents another key module of fading inflammation [283], is significantly impaired in patients with severe injuries showing resistance towards intrinsic neutrophil apoptosis [284]. At the molecular level, reduced GSK3\u03b2 enzymatic activity prevents the phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination/degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 (\u201cmyeloid cell leukemia 1\u201d). Thus, the stabilization and accumulation of Mcl-1 results in the suppression of pro-apoptotic events and a prolonged neutrophil lifespan [284]. Another example is the IL-17A-induced promotion of pulmonary fibrosis. Here, IL-17A stimulation results in PI3K-dependent inactivation of GSK3\u03b2, inhibition of GSK3\u03b2-Bcl-2 binding, reduced Bcl-2 phosphorylation and ubiquitination, and increased Bcl-2 levels in murine MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells.

            "text": "The development of different forms of tolerance towards the sustained stimulation with various activating agents is also regarded as an event contributing to the resolution of inflammation. In this context, the term tolerance describes a physiological phenomenon in which a pretreatment of organisms or specific cell types (e.g., monocyte/macrophages or hepatocytes) with a specific activating stimulus over a certain time leads to the resistance towards further stimulation with the same (or, in the case of cross-tolerance, another) substance. In its pure form, tolerance is mostly expressed as TNF, LPS, or TNF/LPS (cross-)tolerance [286] and reflected by the repression of immunologically relevant genes, such as IL-8 [287] or Il-6 [288]. TNF tolerance may occur in two forms, i.e., absolute tolerance (in which gene expression is blocked) and induction tolerance (in which gene expression is not further inducible). Low-dose preincubation predominantly results in absolute tolerance, whereas high-dose preincubation induces both absolute and induction tolerance [289]. Amongst other mechanisms, the development of low-dose TNF tolerance as well as TNF-induced cross-tolerance towards LPS depends on the activity of GSK3 [286], since GSK3 remained in an active state during TNF preincubation [288], while pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of GSK3 are able to reverse the formation of these forms of tolerance [288,289]. Mechanistically, GSK3 inhibition appears to counteract several molecular effects observed in low-dose tolerized cells, especially the increased phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB-p65 at the inhibiting site Ser468 and the reduced phosphorylation at the activating site Ser536 [289]. The latter can be traced to direct association of C/EBP\u03b2 with p65 in tolerant cells [290]. It has been further shown that a GSK3 inhibitor can suppress the rapid resynthesis and nuclear accumulation of I\u03baB\u03b1 that occurs during LPS stimulation following TNF preincubation, suggesting that GSK3 is involved in the I\u03baB\u03b1-mediated restriction of NF-\u03baB signaling under these conditions [288]. In addition, GSK3 inhibition in TNF-tolerized cells also results in increased binding of p65 at the promoters of tolerizable genes (e.g., IL-6), reduced expression of A20 (a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB signaling, e.g., during TNF incubation [291]), and enhanced chromatin accessibility [288]. Recently, it has further been demonstrated that numerous proteins differentially phosphorylated under conditions inducing high-dose TNF tolerance are potential GSK3 targets [259]. However, further analyses have to elucidate whether additional GSK3-dependent mechanisms are involved in the complex regulation of tolerance formation and the termination of pro-inflammatory signaling.",

            "text": "As shown in this review, GSK3 is a versatile kinase targeting a variety of substrates. Thus, GSK3 controls a plethora of cellular functions at various mechanistic levels by orchestrating numerous molecular events. With respect to inflammation, GSK3 acts as a potent and multifunctional regulator of both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. Among both paralogs, GSK3\u03b2 appears to be the more influential kinase in terms of imunoregulatory action. Its specific effect, however, appears to depend on the respective cellular and molecular conditions. In general, active GSK3 involves a strong pro-inflammatory component by supporting the execution of multifaceted pro-inflammatory events. Conversely, GSK3 inhibition, either following physiological Ser9 phosphorylation or via pharmacological approaches, predominantly contributes to the amelioration of inflammation (as summarized in Table 1). The latter also includes the termination of pro-inflammatory signaling and the induction of (cross-)tolerance. Remarkably, several exceptions from this principle have been described. This janiform and to some extent contradictory nature is part of the mystery surrounding GSK3. During inflammation, modulation of GSK3(\u03b2) activity may affect multiple regulatory levels. These include enzymatic activity, signal transduction, transcription and translation, as well as localization and stability. Thus, due to its two-faced nature and its eclectic regulatory possibilities, GSK3 can be regarded as a key factor steering and balancing the initiation, progress, and resolution of inflammation. In consequence, a better understanding of its complex modulatory role during inflammatory processes may represent a promising opportunity to specify and modify different stages of inflammatory diseases.",
