            "text": "'Us' and 'them' in the coronavirus outbreak A core risk factor governing the emergence of social tension/conflict during the outbreak of Covid-19 will be the extent to which there is a widespread sense that some sections of the community are being treated unfairly as a consequence of policy measures. This may be because different measures taken by the authorities apply to different groups or because the same measure impacts differently on different groups. For instance, if quarantining measures (e.g. self-isolation) are seen as disproportionately penalizing poorer groups in society (who are less able to afford time off work), then there is a real potential for social division between the 'haves' and the 'have nots'. The risk may be amplified when agencies who then enforce such measures (i.e. police, army, etc.) are then seen as agents of privileged groups rather than neutral guardians of law and order. In such circumstances, there is a danger of these enforcement agencies becoming seen as the illegitimate agent of the 'other' and for a loss of trust and conflict to emerge. In such contexts, minor confrontations in one location can then be seen by others in different locations as indicative of wider illegitimacies in their relationship to authority and disorder can begin to escalate and spread Ball et al., 2019; Drury et al., 2019) .",

As a result, people and communities will be more likely to selfregulate (for instance, complying with the instructions of authority figures, spontaneously challenging those who act against the communal interest) and to be more positive towards external regulation by the police and other agencies. From this perspective, the public are potentially the most powerful resource that the authorities have to deal with emergencies. The role of the police and other authorities, then, is to work with citizens to scaffold, rather than substitute for (or, at worst, suppress) community 'self-regulation'. Moreover, insofar as they are able to act in this way, the police come to be seen as 'of us' and 'for us' (Reicher et al., 2004; Reicher et al., 2007; Stott et al., 2008) .",

In this regard, it is important to consider what police resources will be available (e.g. Police Support Units (PSUs) via Mutual Aid) and how they will be mobilized from one place to another in ways that support local neighbourhood policing operations, community relations, and goals. Following the guidelines given to Behavioural Science group, we use three examples to translate the general principles outlined above into specific scenarios.

Moreover, other members of the community are more likely to support police action. In operational terms, such a scenario means that the police should set up local command structures that involve input from community members and that they should work with community mediators to try to prevent people presenting at hospital unnecessarily. In particular, communication about the need to ration resources comes best from within the community itself and may increase the potential for community selfregulation decreasing the likelihood of people presenting unnecessarily. (b) Anger arises at those who refuse to self-isolate and are seen to act in ways that spread disease: this is the potential 'dark side' of creating strong norms of acting for the communal good and of collective self-regulation that targets norm violators. This can easily spill over into vigilantism unless care is taken to communicate clearly how disapproval should be expressed in strictly limited ways, how it is important to report serious norm violations, and that violence against violators will itself require policing resources that could better be used elsewhere and, hence, undermines collective interests. Such vigilantism becomes particularly serious under conditions where individuals are treated as proxies for groups and hostility extends to all members of the group-the notion, for instance, that ethnic minority members have behaved in ways that endanger the health of the majority has been at the root of pogroms throughout history. Hence, it is particularly important to monitor the activities of 'hate groups' and the incidence of hate crime and to make a challenge to racist rumours and reacting to incidents a key priority of neighbourhood and response policing efforts. Once again, the success of these interventions depends upon the active involvement of a diverse array of community representatives with the police at a local level both in the framing and the delivery of policy. (c) Most religious groups suspend their gatherings, but others do not. This would be a particularly egregious example of the previous scenario, especially if the groups still meeting were from an ethnic minority where prior community tensions have been high. In such cases, the probability of violence would be high and the police themselves may come under attack for intervening to prevent these attacks. Hence, it would be very important to avoid such situations through prior dialogue, through assessing religious needs and priorities at a local level, and, where necessary, by facilitating alternative means of satisfying these without gathering. Here more than ever, a focus on understanding and facilitating the legitimate goals and values of a community (e.g. to worship) combined with the early implementation of structures for police dialogue with all sectors of the diverse communities within a specific area is critical to avoiding circumstances where conflict might develop.",

Characteristically, people respond to emergencies by developing a very strong sense of community and displaying remarkable altruism. With careful management both at a general policy level and in terms of sensitive community-based and dialogue-led policing, it will be possible to maintain a sense of common endeavour and, hence, to draw on the community as a key resource in dealing with the crisis. The two keys are to build a sense of 'usness'-of shared identity and shared fate-at every decision point and to be especially sensitive to any fault lines in the community which could lead particular groups (including the authorities) to be seen as 'them' rather than 'us'.",
