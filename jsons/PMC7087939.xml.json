In Fall 2008, SFHBF launched the \u201cB a Hero\u201d media campaign to convey the message that anyone can be a hero by talking to friends and family about getting tested for hepatitis B (Fig. 1). The goal of using the upbeat and positive superhero image was to destigmatize the disease within the Asian community by normalizing hepatitis B and bringing the subject into open conversation so that the importance of screening, vaccination and treatment could then be addressed. \u201cB a Hero\u201d posters were placed along commute corridors and other high-traffic places. While the campaign message was widely disseminated to the whole San Francisco population in English, Asians were targeted due to their high risk for infection through distributing advertisements through in-language ethnic newspapers and the use of Asian models for the media images.\n",

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate risk factors for having been tested for HBV, having asked for a HBV test, and recognition of the B a Hero logo, and perception of greater community awareness about HBV in the last year compared to years before. Covariates include sex, ethnicity, age, years spent in the US and household income. Lastly, because we had many more Chinese respondents than those from other Asian groups, sub-analyses were performed on select variables to determine whether replies from Chinese respondents were significantly different from those who were Asian but not Chinese. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1.3 for Windows (Cary, NC).",

            "text": "Surveys of clinicians in the San Francisco Bay Area indicate that while almost all knew that Asians were disproportionately affected by hepatitis B infection and liver cancer, levels of hepatitis B screening and vaccination for their Asian patients remain suboptimal [32, 33]. A 1 year follow-up study of a pilot hepatitis B screening effort of Chinese Americans in the area suggest that poor clinical follow-up for screened patients may be due to ineffective communication between patients and their providers, and the lack of awareness on the part of primary care providers about appropriate follow-up actions [34]. Together with our findings, these facts suggest that efforts to increase hepatitis B screening among Asians must both mobilize the public to request testing, as well as educate providers and institute processes that would remind them to test high-risk patients. In this next phase of the campaign, SFHBF is capitalizing on our target population\u2019s high level of trust in the medical providers by focusing on outreach to the clinician community (Table 6). In addition to continuation of educational events and distributing a screening algorithm developed earlier in the campaign, SFHBF is promoting a clinician\u2019s honor roll to encourage clinicians to pledge to test patients at risk for hepatitis B infections, and has created a \u201cPatient Ask Sheet\u201d that may be distributed at public venues to help individuals proactively ask their providers for hepatitis B testing and/or vaccination (Fig. 3).\n",

Because the campaign did not have the resources to conduct a representative-sample survey of the San Francisco Asian population, our results can only be considered an evaluation of our specific outreach program and cannot be extrapolated to all Asians living in San Francisco. Also, even though a wide array of monolingual Asians reside in San Francisco, we only had the resources to survey one monolingual group (Cantonese speakers, the largest proportion of monolingual Asians in San Francisco [6]). By recruiting for our street intercept interviews at locations frequented by Chinese residents and interviewing non-Cantonese-speaking Asians in English only, we overrepresented monolingual Cantonese speakers and may have excluded valuable feedback from non-Chinese Asians that also have high prevalence of HBV infection, such as Vietnamese, Cambodian and Korean residents. Also, while we did find a higher percentage of respondents who were familiar with hepatitis B (90%) compared to studies in similar populations in other parts of North America, (ranging from 56% to 86% [15, 26, 27, 30, 35\u201338]), and that almost half of our respondents reported seeing an increase in hepatitis B awareness within their community in the past year, we are unable to directly attribute these apparent increases to SFHBF due to the lack of baseline data from the period before 2007, with the most recent local data having been produced in 2000 [10].",

It is the first recent assessment of hepatitis B knowledge, attitudes and testing behavior among Asian residents of San Francisco. Our use of many open-ended questions and lack of initial prompting about hepatitis B as the survey\u2019s subject matter should have elicited objective feedback about how a sample of Asians in San Francisco prioritize hepatitis B in relation to other health issues in their community. We were able to use results from this project to determine where to focus upcoming campaign activities, resulting in a new and nationally-recognized media campaign with messaging that emphasizes the serious consequences of infection and a more focused strategy for clinician outreach. It is our hope that, by simultaneously driving both the Asian community to seek testing from their medical providers and the clinician community to be more vigilant in initiating testing and vaccination, SFHBF and our partner organizations can build a comprehensive and sustainable strategy to significantly decrease the burden of disease caused by hepatitis B in San Francisco.",
