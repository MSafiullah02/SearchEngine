            "text": "The incidence of ADEM from different causes has been reported to be between 0.4 and 0.8 per 100,000 of population [16], [17] with a median age of onset of 4.5 to 7.5 in pediatric studies [18], [19] and 33.5 in a study of adult patients [20]. Disease has a seasonal peak in winter and spring, consistent with its putative infectious etiologies. ADEM typically appears with the abrupt onset of neurologic symptoms 2 to 30 days after the occurrence of a preceding infection or vaccination [19]. A clear preceding infection or vaccination is not found, however, in around one third of children and half of adults presenting with disease [16], [19], [21]. The contribution of different infections or vaccination to disease varies based on regional immunization programs, with the natural infections still reported to constitute most cases (93%) in countries with widespread immunization against childhood viral infections [16], [22]. Systemic symptoms including fever (43%\u201352%), headache (45%\u201358%), malaise, and myalgias may occur shortly before the appearance of neurologic signs and symptoms [22], [23]. ADEM usually presents as a monophasic demyelinating disease, and neurologic manifestations depend on which region of the CNS is affected, with the most common signs including obtundation and depressed consciousness; unilateral or bilateral long tract signs (85%); acute hemiparesis (76%); and ataxia (59%) [19]. Depressed mental status exists in cases of ADEM. Meningismus (26%\u201331%), caused by inflammation in subarachnoid space, can also be found on neurologic examination [22], [23]. Although motor deficits occur in both adult and pediatric cases, sensory deficits are more frequent in adults but seizures predominate in pediatric cases; one study has reported prolonged focal motors seizures in 70% of children with a high tendency to develop status epilepticus. Involvement of peripheral nervous system is rare in childhood ADEM but more common in adult patients, usually in the form of acute polyradiculoneuropathy [19], [20]. Although ADEM displays a monophasic disease course, rare cases of disease relapse have been described in some studies. Long-term clinical and imaging follow-up has shown the resolution of lesions with no long-lasting neurologic impairments in most of these multiphasic cases [22].",

            "text": "Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a common clinical presentation of postinfectious or postvaccinal ADEM that is characterized by focal inflammation of the spinal cord with subsequent neural injury [29], [30] leading to sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction. About one third of patients have pain in the distribution of the involved segments of the spinal cord, before the development of sensory-motor or autonomic symptoms. At the peak of the disease about 50% of patients with ATM are paraplegic; 80% to 94% have been reported to have paresthesia, dysesthesia, or numbness; with almost all the patients suffering from bladder dysfunction [31], [32], [33], [34]. Although ATM can occur in the context of multifocal CNS disease or as a part of multisystemic autoimmune disorders (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus or sarcoidosis) [35], [36], it can also present as an isolated idiopathic entity [29]. The initial events leading to detrimental autoimmune responses targeting spinal cord are still a matter of debate, but disease has been pathogenically linked to postinfectious demyelinating disorders [29], [37]. Indeed, in 30% to 60% of idiopathic cases there is a preceding respiratory, gastrointestinal, or systemic illness [31], [32], [38]. Like cerebral ADEM, ATM has also been reported following measles, rubella, influenza, and hepatitis B vaccinations (see below) [39], [40], [41], [42]. In about 5% of cases, transverse myelitis represents the first attack of MS. Unlike ATM, however, sensory-motor impairments following myelopathic MS are usually asymmetric, making the two entities distinguishable [43]. Moreover, monosegmental involvement of the spinal cord is more commonly seen in myelopathic MS, compared with other ATM etiologies [44]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and abnormal IgG index can be observed in both MS and ATM. Initial severity of weakness and evidence of denervation on electromyography has been considered poor prognostic indicators for ATM [45]. Approximately one third of patients with ATM recover completely, one third show partial recovery with moderate disabilities, and the rest of the cases lead to permanent severe disabilities [46].",

Axons in the areas of demyelination are relatively preserved and neuronal soma are less affected. Hyperemia and periventricular edema followed by fibrosis in the later stages of disease are also seen [48]. AHLE is characterized by petechial hemorrhages around blood vessels with infiltrates containing high numbers of polymorphonuclear cells, perivascular demyelination, and fibrosis [49]. AHLE is believed to be the outcome of the same pathogenic process as ADEM but with a more severe clinical course and poorer prognosis [50].",

Despite the availability of vaccines in many countries, measles virus still remains one of the most common global infectious causes of childhood mortality and neurologic morbidity. Measles infection can cause a transient but severe suppression of cell-mediated immunity, which is the chief reason for postmeasles fatal complications, including disseminated pneumonitis and bacterial infections [53]. Paradoxically, measles infection can also lead to ADEM, an autoimmune phenomenon. The incidence of ADEM is 1 to 2 per 1000 measles infections, being more common in children above 5 years of age [54]. Postmeasles ADEM varies in its time of onset, with most cases developing when the fever and rash from the primary infection are diminishing. Return of the fever together with headache and signs of meningeal irritation herald the start of inflammation in the brain. Focal or generalized convulsions that can be followed by coma have been reported in about half of the patients. Gradual or abrupt depression of consciousness may occur. Focal neurologic deficits indicative of the involvement of cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, or spinal cord may develop. CSF shows a mild mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated protein content in most patients [55]. Mortality rate is high, reported to be between 10% and 40% in different studies, with a substantial number of survivors suffering permanent neurologic sequelae. The length of stupor or coma has been generally considered a poor prognostic factor [54], [56]. On pathologic examination of postmortem brains, perivenular infiltration of mononuclear cells together with demyelination is observed, features that are reminiscent of EAE neuropathology. ADEM comprises about 95% of postmeasles neurologic complications with the rest being myelitis, polyneuritis, and toxic encephalopathy.Box 1Causes of postinfectious and postvaccinal encephalomyelitis\nViral infections\u2022Measles\u2022Varicella-zoster\u2022Rubella\u2022Mumps\u2022Influenza A and B\u2022Hepatitis A\u2022Hepatitis C\u2022Epstein-Barr virus\u2022HIV\u2022Nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection\u2022Human herpsevirus-6a\n\u2022Herpes simplex virusa\n\u2022Dengue virusa\n\u2022Coxsackie Ba\n\u2022Coronavirusa\n\nNonviral infections\u2022Group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci\u2022\nLegionella pneumophila\n\u2022\nSalmonella typhi\n\u2022Leptospirosis\u2022\nPlasmodium falciparum\n\u2022\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n\u2022\nRickettsia rickettsii\n\u2022\nBorrelia burgdorferi\n\nPostvaccinal ADEM\u2022Rabies vaccine made in brain or spinal cord preparations\u2022Measles\u2022Japanese encephalitis virus\u2022Oral polivirus\u2022Tetanus toxoid\u2022Influenza\u2022Hepatitis B recombinant vaccine\u2022Tick-borne encephalitisa\n\n\naDenotes single case-reports.",

Some children develop fever, rash, and conjunctivitis in the second week after immunization. This is rarely followed by neurologic manifestations of encephalomyelitis. Indeed, the reported incidence is one to two per million doses, which is not above the background incidence. Nevertheless, there is a much higher incidence of encephalomyelitis following measles infection (20\u201330 per million infections), which can be prevented by vaccination [86]. Live attenuated varicella vaccine might cause a mild case of chickenpox, which can be followed by cerebellar ataxia. This resolves completely, however, as is the case for natural varicella infection [86]. Rubella vaccine has not been implicated in encephalomyelitis, although transient paresthesias and mild signs of neuropathy have been reported 1 to 3 weeks after vaccination. Encephalomyelitis associated with tetanus toxoid [87], oral polio [88], influenza [42], [89], and hepatitis B recombinant vaccines [90] have also been described [86] (see also [91] for adverse events associated with childhood vaccines). The pathogenic process leading to development of postvaccinal encephalomyelitis is generally believed to be the same as the virus-associated ADEM (ie, molecular mimicry or altered immunoregulation). In the case of oral polio\u2013associated paralytic events, however, it might be simply recapitulating poliomyelitis disease course (see Box 1).",

Infection with Mycobacterium avium complex, Cryptococcus neoformans, JC virus, and cytomegalovirus are the more closely associated microbial etiologies [92], [93], [94]. Exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are two examples of IRIS-mediated reaction against self-antigens. As expected from the underlying immunopathogenesis, clinical IRIS might represent as an anatomically compartmentalized phenomenon (ie, where the microbial or self-antigen is already present). Lower CD4+ T cell counts and higher plasma viral load at the time of HAART initiation together with younger age at the onset of HAART have been reported as risk factors for IRIS development [95], [96], [97].",

Before the advent of HAART, there were no effective therapies for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Some progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy patients' clinical status deteriorates after the start of HAART, however, a phenomenon attributed to the restoration of immune function (ie, IRIS) [94], [100]. Indeed, NeuroIRIS occurs in the context of other CNS disorders associated with HIV infection including CNS tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and HIV-associated dementia. Imaging of NeuroIRIS shows contrast enhancement in all cases of clinical deterioration. Neuropathologic analyses in these cases have shown perivascular and intraparenchymal infiltration of T lymphocytes [101] and severe demyelinating lesions [98]. In fatal cases, the inflammatory infiltrates are chiefly composed of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, whereas in less severe cases CD4+ cells with macrophage activation have been more evident [98]. NeuroIRIS has also been reported in conjunction with cytomegalovirus infection of brain [93]. Although chiefly described in association with opportunistic infections, few cases of NeuroIRIS have been reported as acute deterioration of HIV-associated dementia following the initiation of HAART [102], [103]. Perivascular and intraparenchymal infiltration of inflammatory cells, chiefly CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, have been described in neuropathologic examinations in these cases of NeuroIRIS [102], [103].",

Sequence similarity searches to find common linear epitopes between different ADEM-inducing pathogens and myelin basic protein have yielded some results, including a sequence similarity between myelin basic protein and hepatitis B nonstructural polymerase [115].

ADEM is typically a monophasic disease of children with a slight male preponderance, whereas MS is usually a chronic relapsing-remitting disease that has its first onset in young adults, with a female predilection. A history of a preceding infection followed by the return of fever, and systemic symptoms, altered level of consciousness, multifocal neurologic dysfunction, seizures, and movement disorders are cardinal features of ADEM, but as a syndrome are not seen together in MS. From a clinical viewpoint, however, ADEM can be difficult to distinguish from the first attack of MS and a clouded sensorium is often the most prominent distinguishing feature (\nTable 1).",

            "text": "Neuroimaging plays a key role in the diagnosis of ADEM from other similar entities. Both CT scanning and MRI have been used to diagnose ADEM; however, MRI is much more informative. CT scan of brain can be normal at the onset and start to reveal abnormalities as late as 5 to 14 days after the start of the disease, showing multifocal subcortical lesions in the white matter [116]. Hemorrhage and edema can be detected in CT scans of AHLE cases [116]. MRI changes occur much earlier, usually when the neurologic signs and symptoms appear. MRI abnormalities are more likely to be seen on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. ADEM MRI typically shows multiple, large lesions in subcortical and central white matter in cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord [23]. Lesions might involve gray matter of basal ganglia and the junction of gray-white matter in cerebral hemispheres [19], [117]. The margins of ADEM lesions are usually blurry, unlike the well-defined sharply demarcated lesions of MS. ADEM lesions are more amorphous than MS plaques and they lack the vertical orientation to the midline axis of brain, which is frequently seen in MS plaques. Gadolinium enhancement in T1-weighted images has been reported in 30% to 100% of patients in different studies, likely reflecting the stage and severity of inflammation. Unlike MS, different lesions in ADEM appear at the same time, hence less variability in contrast enhancement between lesions [118]. Complete resolution of lesions after treatment has been reported in 37% to 75% of patients and partial resolution in 25% to 53% of cases [23], [119]. More advanced imaging techniques have also been used in cases with the suspicion of ADEM. Positive emission tomography scanning in one study has shown decreased global and bilateral cerebral metabolism and reduced cerebral blood flow [120]. Reduced blood flow and metabolism has been linked to ADEM severity and clinical course in this study [120].Tc-99m single photon emission CT shows areas of hypoperfusion, whereas MRI has been showing more limited lesions in the same cases [121]. SPECT with acetazolamide has shown longer-lasting lesions compared with MRI [122]. It is likely that longer-lasting cerebral circulatory impairment evident in SPECT might underlie the neurocognitive deficits observed after the resolution of neurologic abnormalities and MRI lesions [122].",

A common clinical feature of viral encephalitis is of an abrupt onset of a febrile disease, accompanied by headache, altered consciousness, and cognitive and behavioral disturbances [123]. Herpes simplex virus is the commonest agent for acute sporadic viral encephalitis. Other common viral agents are varicella-zoster virus, measles, mumps, and enteroviruses, hence the same causative agents as ADEM [123], [124]. Having common clinical features and etiologic agents with ADEM, the diagnosis is not always straightforward. Younger age of onset, history of prodromal infection or vaccination, focal neurologic signs including visual loss, spinal cord symptoms, and involvement of peripheral nerves point to ADEM. If not accompanied by meningitis, signs of meningeal irritation are less common in acute viral encephalitis. CSF analysis of ADEM usually shows features similar to that of acute viral encephalitis (ie, lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein levels, normal glucose, with negative cultures). Unlike viral encephalitis, however, virus culture or PCR detection of pathogens shows negative results. Red blood cells appear in CSF most commonly in the cases of AHLE and herpes encephalitis [123], [124], [125]. MRI in acute viral encephalitis can identify characteristic changes caused by specific pathogens in brain (eg, frontotemporal changes in herpes simplex encephalitis or striatal-thalamic lesions in Japanese or West Nile encephalitis). T2-weighted images of acute viral encephalitis usually show one or more diffuse areas of increased intensity affecting the cortical gray matter and subjacent white matter [123], although the gray matter of basal ganglia or brainstem might be involved but to a lesser extent [123].",

            "text": "Vaccination against viral etiologies has significantly decreased the incidence of viral cases of ADEM, and the risk imposed by vaccines themselves is significantly less than natural infections. There is a lack of placebo-controlled double-blind studies to evaluate different treatment options for ADEM. Nevertheless, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy has been the most widely used treatment for ADEM. Adrenocorticotropic hormone and prednisone have been successfully used in the past [126], [127]. Currently, intravenous methylprednisolone (10\u201330 mg/kg/d) or dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) for 3 to 5 days are the most commonly used steroids in pediatric cases [18], [23]. Intravenous glucocorticoid therapy needs to be tapered with administration of oral steroids for 4 to 6 weeks, following intravenous therapy. Shorter tapering might increase the risk of relapses [128]. In the first few days of disease, intravenous methylprednisolone might be combined with intravenous acyclovir if there is still a suspicion of acute viral encephalitis. Intravenous immunoglobulin has been used alone or in combination with glucocorticoids with a dose of 1 to 2 g/kg single-dose or divided over 3 to 5 days [129], [130]. Although reports of success exist for intravenous immunoglobulin treatment of autoimmune disorders, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for ADEM remains at the level of case-reports. One study recommends high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, given separately or in combination with high-dose methylprednisolone, in cases of severe debilitating pediatric-onset acute encephalomyelitis [131]. The mechanism of intravenous immunoglobulin action is not well-known; it might have immunomodulatory effects through binding to pathogenic antibodies or myelin basic protein\u2013mimicking antigens, thereby inhibiting the generation or activation of myelin-reactive T cells.",
