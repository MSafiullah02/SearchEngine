It is widely used as anti-malarial agent and has established immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity; it has also proven clinical efficacy against a large variety of viral infections by increasing endosomal pH required for virus replication [2] . Considering the public health emergency since the onset of the new coronavirus pandemic, repositioning of this molecule is an interesting strategy because pharmacokinetics, safety profile, posology and drug interactions of HQ are well known [3] [4] [5] . Many emerging evidences have converged on the efficacy of HQ in the treatment of Covid-19 infection [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Multicenter clinical trials conducted in China showed apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia [8] . In a recent series reported by Gautret et al. [9] , the authors demonstrated that HQ treatment has a significant effect, both in terms of clinical outcome and viral clearance. At day 6 post-inclusion, 70% of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologically cured comparing with 12.5% in the control group. Gautret et al. suggested that further works are needed to determine if HQ antiviral prophylaxis is useful, especially for healthcare workers [9] .",

Indeed, caregivers are in the frontline against the Covid-19 all around the world and are particularly exposed to infection. According to many reports, Thousands of nurses and doctors contracted the virus since the onset of the new coronavirus [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In China, among the 44672 cases, a total of 1716 were healthcare workers (3.8%), as of February 11, 2020 [10] . In Italy, as of March 20th, 2020, according to the country's National Health Institute, seventeen doctors have died from Covid-19 and there are at least 3654 healthcare workers that have been infected, representing 9% of total cases [11] [12] [13] . In Paris, France, as of March 20th, 2020, there were 345 healthcare workers infected by the Covid-19 [14] . And as of March 23rd, 2020, five doctors have died from Covid-19 in France [15, Page 4 of 9 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 16] . The number of infected healthcare workers is probably underestimated because they are not always tested [11] .",

The more healthcare staff is infected, the weaker the responsiveness of the healthcare system, particularly in a context of a chronic shortage of staff and means [19, 20] . This vicious circle could increase mortality among Covid-19 hospitalized patients. It is important to preserve the healthcare reserve which is the back spine in the fight against Covid-19.

            "text": "These recommendations are empiric and are not based on the results of a clinical trial. As of April 15th, 2020, Paris hospitals in France have begun a randomized trial in 900 participants, called PrEP Covid, to access both of HQ and azithromycine in Covid-19 prophylaxis, the trial will access a 200mg per day posology of HQ, results are expected within 2 to 3 months [24]. Chang, R and al. recommended safe and potentially efficacious dose regimens for protection against COVID-19 based on a review of chloroquine's antiviral mechanisms, its laboratory efficacy activity against COVID-19, as well as its pharmacokinetics in established indications. The authors recommended pre-exposure prophylaxis of 250-500mg daily and post-exposure prophylaxis at 8mg/kg/day for 3 days [21]. An urgent clinical assessment is needed to access the effectiveness of HQ anti Covid-19 chemoprophylaxis, the optimal dosage and the balance between the benefits and risks. Regarding the potential benefits: does anti-viral prophylaxis reduce the risk of infection with Covid-19? In the event of infection, does it reduce the viral carriage and therefore the virus transmissibility? Does it reduce the percentage of serious forms requiring respiratory assistance? And does it reduce mortality among caregivers?",
