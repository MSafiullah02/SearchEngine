Online services became the alternative for many dwellers, particularly in Wuhan. This alternative also came with some hurdles, as goods ordered took longer than expected to arrive. Moreover, newer policies barred door-to-door delivery services in some communities. Thus, individuals had to pick their ordered items at the community entrance further increasing their chances of contracting the virus. This could be described as inefficiency in the delivery market. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) or selfdriving cars provided by companies such as JD and Meitan came in to solve this market failure as it also helps to reduce the spread of the virus.",

Touted as the second-largest economy in the world with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP growth rate of US $13.9 trillion and 6.1%, respectively, as at 2019 (Figure 1) 1 and projected to take over the number one spot as the largest economy, it is clear that \"when China sneezes, the rest of the world catches cold.\" Undisputedly, the COVID-19 has immensely dented global economies as shown by indicators from the various market and reports from factories in China and other parts of the world. For instance, the world's largest producer of car parts, Robert Bosch GmbH is reported to have shut down two factories which employed a little over 800 people in Wuhan. 2 Honda Motors Co, Ltd, and Nissan Motor Co, Ltd, have also shut down their factory in Wuhan. There has been a fall in global stock prices (Figure 2) 3 as well as oil price all due to quarantines, cancelation of flights by many airlines, factories shut down, and so forth. This has reduced demand for oil drastically given that China is the second largest consumer of oil. 4 Given the unfortunate spread of COVID-19 across the borders of China into other countries, the negative effects have multiplied.",

The identification of symptoms, finding newer treatments, and tracking the spread of the disease became a herculean task for authorities. For instance, some health professionals although in protective gear who came into contact with patients ended up contracting the disease. Artificial intelligence powering futuristic technologies came in to resolve these issues. Interactions made via robots made treatment of sick patients easier, reduced disease transmission, and saved health workers time on simple tasks. Robots were now being used in communicating with isolated patients, disinfecting rooms, taking vital statistics, and delivering medications. In addition, meal delivery robots provided by Keenon Robotics reached people in hospitals and quarantine zones in more than 40 cities. 7 People who might be sick or not wearing masks, walking in open spaces were detected and alerted via powerful surveillance technologies, such as facial recognition enabled cameras and drones. Although potentially unreliable, infrared thermometers or thermometer guns increasingly become common in China, where people's temperatures were regularly checked by health workers. 8 Schools and universities in China, for the time being, remain closed indefinitely to minimize the spread of the virus. To reduce the impact of the postponements, online classrooms that enable teachers and professors to conduct online courses from homes such as DingTalk and Tencent Education were launched. Furthermore, online educational platforms such as Liulishuo, Onion Academy, and Zuoyebang currently offer free online classes to students nationwide.",

The spread of the COVID-19 witnessed health service providers cashing in on the sale of fake cures (vitamin C boosters), face masks, disinfectant wipes, and newly published books on online platforms. 9 This also led to price gouging, referring to the practice where prices of goods are hiked up to unreasonably high levels due to the increase in demand. For instance, a 50-piece surgical mask sold on Amazon at \u00a310 early January 2020 shot up to \u00a3170 a few weeks later as the virus spread heightened (ibid). The World Health Organization (WHO) expressing concerns about some of this misleading information especially on Amazon helped rectify this anomaly. A million products with the claim of protecting patients against the coronavirus or even curing it have now been banned on Amazon. Furthermore, tens of thousands of overpriced health products from unscrupulous sellers have also been removed from the platform. Aside from WHO and the various departments of health raising awareness via traditional media, many companies are offering new tools to share reliable information and counteract myths especially in this age where fake news, rumors, and misinformation travel faster than pathogens. For example, a map layer has been created on top of Baidu's Map App that indicates real-time locations of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus. 10 A platform created by Qihoo 360 now provides information about the health status of travelers boarding trains or planes. New entries on the relevant symptoms, medical treatments, and preventive measures are currently updated on Medipedia, a health care encyclopedia, and are edited and reviewed by renowned medical experts.
