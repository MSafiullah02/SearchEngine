Cloning of the cDNA of this enzyme and biochemical studies revealed that the large extracellular domain of the enzyme with the catalytically active site contains nine cysteine residues that are highly conserved among species. To investigate the functional role of these cysteines in TRH-DE we used a site-directed mutagenesis approach and replaced individually each cysteine by a serine residue. The results revealed that the proteolytically truncated and enzymatically fully active enzyme consists of two identical subunits that are associated noncovalently by protein\u00b1protein interactions but not via interchain S-S bridges. The eight cysteines contained within this region are all important for the structure of the individual subunit and the enzymatic activity, which is dramatically reduced in all mutant enzymes. This is even true for the four cysteines that are clustered within the C-terminal domain remote from the Zn-binding consensus sequence HEICH. In contrast, Cys68, which resides within the stalk region seven residues from the end of the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain, can be replaced by serine without a significant change in the enzymatic activity. Interestingly, this residue is involved in the formation of an interchain disulfide bridge.

TRH-DE is unique in the Zn-dependent aminopeptidase family in that it is the only peptidase that contains a cysteine residue within the zincbinding motif.

From the alignment of the amino-acid sequences we speculated that Cys68, the only Cys residue of the N-terminal peptide fragment that could be left in the membrane after trypsin cleavage, might be involved in disulfide-linked dimerization. Therefore, the wild-type and the C68S mutant were fused in-frame C-terminal of the FLAG-epitope of pFLAG-CMV1 (see Experimental procedures) and expressed in BHK-cells. Membrane fractions from BHK-cells expressing the wild-type or the mutant enzyme were subjected to SDS/PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak). Under reducing conditions (1.5% dithiothreitol), a band of immunoreactive protein with a molecular mass of 130 kDa could be detected for both proteins, the wild-type and the C68S mutant (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3) . Under nonreducing conditions, the same band was also visualized for the C68S mutant (Fig. 4A , lane 6) but not for the wild-type protein (Fig. 4A, lane 5) , which migrated as a high molecular mass protein. These data are compatible with the interpretation that the mutant enzyme may exist as a monomeric fusion protein, while the wild-type protein represents a disulfide-linked homodimer. This hypothesis is further supported by the analysis of the proteolytically truncated, catalytically fully active ectoenzyme from rat brain. Under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, this protein migrates on SDS/PAGE as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 116 kDa (Fig. 4B) indicating that other cysteine residues are not involved in dimer formation.

This cysteine is positioned within the presumed stalk region, a stretch of about 40 amino-acid residues that is a general feature of ectoenzymes and is thought to be important for surface exposition [38] . The hypothesis that this stretch forms a separate domain is supported by the fact that in TRH-DE [21] , as in other enzymes such as in aminopeptidase N (reviewed in [39] ), this region is considerably less conserved than the catalytic domain. As in aminopeptidase A [31, 32] , this cysteine is obviously responsible for intersubunit S-S bridging and thus for the formation of the homodimeric wild-type TRH-DE. Surprisingly, however, covalent dimerization seems not to be essential for the formation and expression of the catalytically active enzyme. Moreover, as also shown with the truncated mutant protein in which the catalytic domain was replaced by GFP, the intermolecular disulfide link via Cys68 appeared not to be essential for trafficking and transport of the protein to the cell surface. In agreement with these results are the data of previous biochemical studies on the dimeric assembly of enterocyte brush border enzymes (e.g. aminopeptidase N and A, dipeptidyl peptidase IV) which demonstrated that homodimerization is not an absolute requirement for transport of these enzymes to, and through, the Golgi complex [40] although dimeric assembly may increase the rate of intracellular transport. For the mouse meprin peptidase, site-directed mutagenesis studies also demonstrated that the covalent dimerization of subunits is not essential for efficient biosynthesis, trafficking or post-translational processing of the secreted protease [33] . Moreover, for membrane dipeptidase, another enzyme with a single disulfide bond close to the membrane surface, mutation of the critical cysteine residue to glycine neither influenced the expression of the mutant enzyme to the cell surface nor the enzymatic properties of the peptidase [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 499, "end": 503, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 603, "end": 607, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 671, "end": 675, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 772, "end": 776, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 777, "end": 780, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1637, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1956, "end": 1960, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2252, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "D I S C U S S I O N"}, {"text": "Taking these data together, it might be reasonable to assume that the noncovalent hydrophobic domain\u00b1domain interactions of the catalytic subunits may represent the major elements that are critical for the structure and function of TRH-DE and related dimeric proteins.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "D I S C U S S I O N"}, {"text": "We thank Andre \u00c2 Wolfstein and Beate Sodeik (Institut fu \u00c8r physiologische Chemie, Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover) for experienced support with confocal fluorescence microscopy, Lutz Schomburg for advice and helpful discussions, Uwe Grunenberg for excellent technical assistance, Valerie Ashe for linguistic help and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for financial support.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A C K N O W L E D G E M E N T S"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Peptides in the brain: the new endocrinology of the neuron", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Guillemin", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1978, "venue": "Science", "volume": "202", "issn": "", "pages": "390--302", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Aspects of hypothalamic regulation of the pituirary gland", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["V"], "last": "Schally", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1978, "venue": "Science", "volume": "202", "issn": "", "pages": "18--28", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Neuroendocrine control of thyrotropin secretion", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Morley", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1981, "venue": "Endocr.
