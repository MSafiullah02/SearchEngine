Such strategy can decrease the number of candidate compounds providing a good starting point for chemical synthesis and biological screening. Therefore, in many cases, virtual screening can be used prior to expensive experimental highthroughput screening. For this reason, since the terms of computational virtual screening came out in the late 1990s, it has been considered as a novel and essential technology in drug discovery. Ligand-and structure-based virtual screenings have been successfully applied to drug discovery programs in various disease areas. After prospective results for various protein targets were obtained, the utility of virtual screening to identify compounds for nucleic acidbased receptors has been the focus of much attention.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Many computational docking programs that can automatically dock small molecules into a binding site of a target receptor with minimum input from an operator have been developed and their applicability has been proven (McInnes 2007 ) .

In order to carry out docking calculations, it is necessary to know the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of a target and the nature of the binding site. 3D structures are identi fi ed by X-ray crystallography or NMR experiments and can be downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al. 2000 ) or predicted by homology modeling using various programs. The next step is to de fi ne the binding site by known information or prediction. When input is prepared, chemical compounds present in the database are docked into the de fi ned binding site of the selected target receptor. There are two purposes of docking studies. One is to predict accurate ligand binding orientation referred as \"molecular modeling\" and the other is to predict activity or binding af fi nity referred as \"scoring.\" A docking result is evaluated by ligand binding orientation through visual inspection and by binding af fi nity using the scoring function. Scoring function is designed to predict the biological activity or binding af fi nity through the evaluation of interactions between ligands and receptor (Halperin et al. 2002 ) . Among various docking programs (Table 12 .1 ), the most widely used programs are AutoDock (Morris et al. 1998 ; Huey et al. 2007 ) , DOCK (Ewing et al. 2001 ) , FlexX (Kramer et al. 1999 ; Stahl 2000 ) , Gold (Jones et al. 1995 ) , Glide (Zhou et al. 2001 ) , Internal Coordinate Mechanics (ICM) (Abagyan and Totrov 1994 ) , and Sur fl ex-Dock (Jain 2003 ; Kellenberger et al. 2004 ) . AutoDock is an automated fl exible docking program designed to predict how small molecules (ligands) bind into the receptor structure. AutoDock is performed with an empirical free energy force fi eld based on a Lamarckian genetic algorithm, to bring about speedy prediction of conformation with calculated free energies of association (Morris et al. 1998 ) . This program has application in X-ray crystallography, structure-based drug design, virtual screening, and protein-protein interaction studies. DOCK was introduced by the Kuntz group at UCSF and uses a rigid body docking algorithm and fl exible ligand docking algorithm to dock the ligand into a negative image of the binding pocket (Ewing et al. 2001 ) . FlexX is a fully automatic computer program for predicting protein-ligand interaction. FlexX can predict not only the lowest energy geometry of the complex of ligand with protein but also the binding af fi nities using an empirical scoring function (B\u00f6hm 1994 ) .

RNAs contain highly conserved structural and functional motifs that may serve as drug targets, so the development of resistance to drugs targeting RNA can be slower than that to drugs targeting protein (Gallego and Varani 2001 ) . In contrast to DNA, which mostly has a double-stranded helix structure, RNA is generally single-stranded and folds into complex 3D structures that provide unique pockets for small molecules (Foloppe et al. 2006 ) , thus making RNA an attractive drug target.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 200, "text": "(Knowles et al. 2002 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 201, "end": 215, "text": "Hermann 2005 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 303, "end": 312, "text": "(Neu 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 336, "end": 362, "text": "(Perrin and Telenti 1998 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 567, "end": 593, "text": "(Gallego and Varani 2001 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 786, "end": 808, "text": "(Foloppe et al. 2006 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RNA-Targeted Virtual Screening"}, {"text": "In spite of these advantages, RNA has not been focus of structure-based drug design, not only due to lack of information of RNA 3D structures, but also due to the sequence-speci fi c unique features of the binding pockets in RNA. The binding pocket of protein usually lies deep in an internal region, separated from solvent. In RNA targets, the binding pockets are large and fl at, located along the surface, and relatively exposed to solvent. Therefore, in using docking algorithms to discover RNAbinding drugs, the physicochemical properties of RNA, such as conformational fl exibility, high negative charge, and solvation, should be taken into account more accurately than those for proteins. Despite such differences between protein and RNA targets, classical protein-ligand docking programs have sometimes successfully performed in RNA-targeted virtual screenings. For example, Kuntz fi rst reported a successful virtual screening using DOCK 3.5 program to identify small molecules in the Available Chemicals Directory (ACD) that targeted an RNA double helix (Chen et al. 1997 ) . Following the fi rst study, many research groups have reported successful studies of virtual screening targeting RNA through protein-based docking methods (Filikov et al. 2000 ; Lind et al. 2002 ; Kang et al. 2004 ; Park et al. 2008 Park et al. , 2011 . Meanwhile, since most of the available docking methods were developed for protein targets, their compliance with RNA targets has been evaluated extensively, and recently Li et al. demonstrated that two widely-used protein docking programs, GOLD 4.0 and Glide 5.0, are appropriate for structure-based drug design and virtual screening for RNA targets (Detering and Varani 2004 ; Li et al. 2010 ) . Several modi fi ed algorithms were established for RNA-targeted virtual screening. For example, Morley and Afshar established an empirical scoring function that appropriately describes steric, polar, and charged interactions in RNA-ligand complexes (Morley and Afshar 2004 ) . This scoring function was implanted in RiboDock program and validated for docking screening of a large-size chemical database. Virtual screening with this program successfully identi fi ed novel ligands for the bacterial ribosomal A-site (Foloppe et al. 2004 ) . Moitessier et al. applied a unique method to the AutoDock docking process, taking into account inherent RNA fl exibility and key water molecules, and this modi fi ed docking tool was validated by (Moitessier et al. 2006 ). In Kuntz et al.'s study, 70 experimental RNA-ligand complexes from PDB were re-docked using the DOCK 6 program, and the resulting docked conformations were rescored with AMBER generalized Born/solvent-accessible surface area (GB/SA) and Poisson-Blotzmann/SA (PB/SA) scoring functions in combination with explicit water molecules and sodium counterions. The success rate for reproducing experimental binding modes was signi fi cantly improved by using AMBER GB/SA or PB/SA (Lang et al. 2009 ) . As small molecules induce RNA conformational changes by binding to structures from preexisting dynamic ensembles (Puglisi et al. 1992 ; Zhang et al. 2007 ; Frank et al. 2009 ; Cruz and Westhof 2009 ; Fulle and Gohlke 2010 ) , large conformational changes in RNA receptors after binding with small molecules during virtual screening must be accounted for. However, current protocols do not consider this point, limiting the range of target structures for the discovery of small molecules. Guilbert and James therefore developed a fl exible docking program called MORDOR, which supports fl exibility in the ligand and limited fl exibility in the RNA for induced-fi t binding. MORDOR performed well not only on 57 test sets of RNA-ligand complexes by retrieving experimental poses within 2.5 \u00c5 with a 74% success rate, but also in discovering ligands for novel targets such as human telomerase RNA Pinto et al. 2008 ) . When comparing the practicality of DOCK 6 and MORDOR, DOCK 6 screened about 3-10 times faster than MORDOR, while MORDOR performed better on ligands with a large number of rotatable bonds (Lang et al. 2009 ) . Most recently, Al-Hashimi's group reported a new strategy for virtual screening targeting an RNA dynamic ensemble constructed by combining NMR spectroscopy and computational molecular dynamics (MD) (Stelzer et al. 2011 ) . This strategy takes into account large degrees of RNA conformational adaptation during virtual screening. This approach was applied to a search for small molecules for HIV-1 TAR (transactivation response element) RNA ( vide infra ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1064, "end": 1083, "text": "(Chen et al. 1997 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1263, "text": "(Filikov et al. 2000 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1282, "text": "Lind et al. 2002 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1301, "text": "Kang et al. 2004 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1318, "text": "Park et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1337, "text": "Park et al. , 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1690, "end": 1717, "text": "(Detering and Varani 2004 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1732, "text": "Li et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 2011, "text": "(Morley and Afshar 2004 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2252, "end": 2272, "text": "(Foloppe et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2473, "end": 2496, "text": "(Moitessier et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2972, "end": 2989, "text": "(Lang et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3107, "end": 3129, "text": "(Puglisi et al. 1992 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 3130, "end": 3149, "text": "Zhang et al. 2007 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 3150, "end": 3169, "text": "Frank et al. 2009 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3170, "end": 3193, "text": "Cruz and Westhof 2009 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3194, "end": 3217, "text": "Fulle and Gohlke 2010 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3889, "end": 3908, "text": "Pinto et al. 2008 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 4098, "end": 4115, "text": "(Lang et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 4318, "end": 4338, "text": "(Stelzer et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RNA-Targeted Virtual Screening"}, {"text": "As one of the best characterized RNA-based regulatory machineries, the interaction of TAR with Tat protein has been focused upon as a target to inhibit HIV-1 replication (Yang 2005 ) .

Two cis -acting elements are required to regulate \u22121 FS. One is a slippery sequence where ribosome-associated tRNAs slip, and the other is RNA secondary structure such as a hairpin or pseudoknot that promotes ribosome pausing. Thermodynamic or kinetic control of RNA secondary structure folding may be important in regulating the ef fi ciency of \u22121 FS. Human immunode fi ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) utilizes \u22121 FS to regulate the expression ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol, which is critical for the production of infectious virion particles (Paulus et al. 1999 ) . The RNA stem-loop sequence that is involved in \u22121 FS of HIV-1 is highly conserved in the main subtypes of HIV-1 (Gareiss and Miller 2009 ). Mutations of this sequence reduce \u22121 FS and decrease viral infectivity and replication (Baril et al. 2003 ; Dulude et al. 2006 ) . In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), replicase genes mainly encode two large replicative polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) which are expressed by two partially overlapped open reading frames ORF 1a and ORF 1b. As ORF 1b has no independent translation initiation site, polyprotein pp1ab encoded by ORF 1b is only translated as a fused protein form with ORF 1a through \u22121 FS. As pp1ab includes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and other replication components which are important proteins for viral replication, \u22121 FS is essential for the synthesis of enzymatic proteins. The stability of the RNA pseudoknot that induces \u22121 FS in the SARS-CoV (SARS-pseudoknot) also has a dramatic effect on \u22121 FS ef fi ciency.

These interactions may alter the stability of the RNA pseudoknot and increase the stalled time of the ribosome on the slippery site, thus increasing the rates of \u22121 FS. Based on these successful results, Park applied the virtual screening strategy to discover ligands for the SARS-pseudoknot, even though its 3D structure was not completely determined. It was known that the SARS-pseudoknot has a unique 3 stem-3 loop structure. They built a 3D model using the RNA pseudoknot predicting program (PSEUDOVIEWER) and Sybyl molecular modeling software, and then Three-dimensional structural model of the SARS-pseudoknot used in this study. It was optimized by molecular dynamics simulation using the Amber 8.0 program. Brown ribbon renders the phosphate backbone of the RNA pseudoknot optimized the RNA structure by AMBER molecular dynamics simulation (Case et al. 2005 ) (Fig. 12.3 ). Using the DOCK 4.0 program, fl exible docking of a commercially-available chemical DB (Leadquest) was conducted. The chemical DB was the same as that previously used for screening against the biotin aptamer RNA pseudoknot. A total of 35 compounds inhibited \u22121 FS, and three structurally analogous compounds ( 43 , 21 , and 10 in Fig. 12 .4 ) reduced \u22121 FS selectively. Compound 43 was the most active, decreasing \u22121 FS ef fi ciency by 80%. In HEK 293 cells, 43 inhibited \u22121 FS in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 value of approximately 0.45 m M (Park et al. 2011 ) . The docking model of 43 in complex with the SARS-pseudoknot is shown in Fig. 12 .5 , and reveals that 43 interacts with various residues including key residues to maintain \u22121 frameshifting ef fi ciency by hydrogen bonds. Compound 43 interacts with the carbonyl oxygen atom (O 2 ) of the U58 uracil base by hydrogen bond, and the nitrogen atom in the thiazole ring of 43 forms a hydrogen bond (2.8 \u00c5) with the 2 \u00a2 -OH group of ribose of C62. The hydrogen bond between the thiazole moiety and the receptor pseudoknot was identi fi ed as one of the key intermolecular interactions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 155, "text": "(Park et al. 2008 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 403, "end": 421, "text": "(Nix et al. 2000 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 424, "end": 440, "text": "Park et al. used", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 503, "end": 517, "text": "(Martin 1992 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2217, "text": "(Case et al. 2005 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2791, "end": 2808, "text": "(Park et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 895, "end": 906, "text": "Fig. 12.1 )", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 949, "end": 958, "text": "Fig. 12.2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1077, "end": 1090, "text": "(Fig. 12.2a )", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1334, "end": 1347, "text": "(Fig. 12.2b )", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2218, "end": 2228, "text": "(Fig. 12.3", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2561, "end": 2568, "text": "Fig. 12", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2885, "end": 2892, "text": "Fig. 12", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Case 2: RNA Pseudoknots"}, {"text": "Riboswitches are highly organized domains within 5 \u00a2 -UTRs of mRNAs and undergo alternate conformational switches.

Upon metabolite binding, one of the riboswitch conformers is stabilized, and is capable of controlling expression of a (Miranda-R\u00edos et al. 2001 ; Mironov et al. 2002 ; Gilbert and Batey 2005 ) in bacteria (Winkler et al. 2002 ; Mandal et al. 2003 ) as well as in some plants and fungi (Sudarsan et al. 2003 ; Bocobza and Aharoni 2008 ) . Therefore, the aptamer domain is an essential element of gene regulation. Riboswitches were originally discovered as an antibiotic target (Blount and Breaker 2006 ; Lee et al. 2009 ; Kim et al. 2009 ) and also have the potential to be developed into designer riboswitches for genetics studies (Suess and Weigand 2008 ) .

Due to several features of RNA (conformational fl exibility, high negative charge, and solvation) that differ from those of proteins, researchers have observed that the conventional protein-ligand docking programs have limitations in accurately predicting RNA-ligand interactions. In some studies, active molecules have been fortuitously obtained by proteintargeted docking programs. However, continuing progress has been made in the development of docking algorithms or scoring functions optimized for RNA receptors, which makes various RNA targets more amenable for structure-based drug design. As an example, consideration of receptor fl exibility is important not only for RNA-based receptors, but has also been a critical issue for protein receptors for a long time. Massive efforts have been made to incorporate protein fl exibility into docking process, but it exponentially in fl ates the potential search space and became impractical.

In protein-targeted virtual screening of chemical databases, many hits with nanomolar or submicromolar activity were identi fi ed.
