Clinical characteristics of patients with a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 has been widespread but mainly include fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath 1,2 .A 65-years-old Caucasian diabetic male patient presented to the ophthalmology clinic complaining of burning eye and discharge for the previous two days. He denied having fever, cough, or any other symptoms. His body temperature was 98.2 \u00b0F (36.8 \u00b0C) and 98.4 \u00b0 F (36.9 \u00b0C) at 2 separate measures. His past medical history was only significant for diabetes mellitus under treatment with Metformin 500 mg twice daily. He did not have a recent travel history or recent illnesses. Slit lamp examination yielded mucoid discharge and follicular conjunctivitis (Figure.1). Establishing a diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, symptomatic treatment with artificial tear was prescribed. Two days later, the patient visited emergency room with a sudden-onset fever of 101.4 \u00b0F, dry cough, and shortness of breath. A computed tomography (CT) scanning of the chest revealed bilateral ground glass opacity of the lungs (Figure.",

Subsequently, another RT-PCR testing of the conjunctival secretion J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was positive for COVID-19 at two separate occasions. Patient received supportive care with nasal 100% O2 along with oral administration of Oseltamivir capsule 75 mg bid and Hydroxychloroquine tablet 200 mg bid. Following improvement of symptoms, he was discharged home uneventfully. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 have not been the centre of attention by emerging guidelines during the outbreak 1,3-5 . Ranging from conjunctival hyperemia, hypersecretion, chemosis, to epiphora, ocular secretions might be a poor source for testing of COVID-19 5 . In a series of 38 patients with clinically-proven COVID-19 from Huebi province of China, Wu et al. found that almost one third of the patients (12 cases) had the manifestations of COVID-19 4 . Of the twelve patients with COVID-19-related ocular diseases, 11 had positive RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab while only two cases had a positive PCR from both nasopharyngeal and ocular secretions. Although the PCR result could have been negative at the first time of our patient presentation, lack of proper protection by our staff might be a high-risk practice. Moreover, unlike the case series by Wu et al., this patient presented initially with a viral conjunctivitis and later developed classic presentation of the COVID-19.",
