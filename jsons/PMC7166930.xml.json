Saline extracts of rabbit kidney were shown to slowly raise the blood pressure (BP) when injected into rabbits. The principle causing this was present in kidney cortex but not in medulla and was destroyed by heating. The authors concluded that the substance was a protein and they named it renin. They speculated that \u2018renin might in some direct or indirect way be associated with hypertrophy of the heart found in renal disease and high BP\u2019. However, these early results could not be repeated in other laboratories, and it was not until late 1930s when renin was \u2018rediscovered\u2019.",

In the early 1970s, the major components of \u2018classical\u2019 circulating RAS (Fig. 1) were identified and there was compelling evidence to indicate important roles for RAS in the regulation of fluid balance and BP. At that time, however, there was widespread skepticism regarding the role of RAS in cardiovascular disease. It was not until the discovery of orally effective angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the first of which was captopril [2], that the paramount importance of RAS in cardiovascular homeostasis and disease was being appreciated. The introduction of losartan, the first orally active and effective angiotensin receptor type 1 blocker [3] further strengthened this concept.",

However, the physiological implications of the RAS have continued to expand (Fig. 2) and we have not seen the entire picture yet. It has gradually become evident that in addition to the \u2018circulating RAS,\u2019 there is a local \u2018tissue RAS\u2019 in most organs and tissues studied. In fact, even intracellular generation of Ang II has been reported [4]. This makes RAS not only an endocrine, but also a paracrine and an intracrine system. Moreover, both the heptaptide angiotensin 2\u20138 (Ang III) and the hexapeptide 3\u20138 (Ang IV) have been shown to be biologically active. The angiotensin 1\u20137 heptapeptide (Ang 1\u20137) appears to play an important role by counterbalancing many actions of Ang II. Angiotensin II and Ang III actions are mediated by AT1 and AT2 receptors only. Recent discoveries have revealed specific functional receptors for Ang IV, Ang 1\u20137, and perhaps most surprisingly, even for renin/prorenin. Therefore, our present expanded view of RAS (Fig. 2) is quite complex and multilayered.",

The authors speculated that blockers of aminopeptidase N might be developed to treat diseases characterized by sodium and fluid retention such as hypertension and heart failure. In theory, such inhibitors may also exert beneficial actions via reduced tissue levels of Ang IV (see below).

Two receptors have been characterized; the M6P/insulin\u2010like growth factor II receptor, a clearance receptor and the specific renin receptor, which activates intracellular signalling and enhances receptor\u2010bound renin catalytic activity on the cell surface (Fig. 4). Renin receptors are abundant in heart, brain and placenta, lower levels being found in kidney and liver [52]. Visceral adipose tissue also expresses renin receptor, whereas subcutaneous adipose tissue expressed less renin receptors [53]. It appears that renin receptors participate in local production of Ang II and may contribute to systemic Ang II levels as well. Binding of prorenin to the renin receptor (Fig. 4) leads to activation of prorenin to active renin, activation of mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases p44/42 and TGF\u2010\u03b2, ultimately increasing contractility, hypertrophy and fibrosis [51, 52]. It has been suggested that blocking renin receptors may be a new target for tissue protection.",

Of particular interest is the use in ONTARGET of telmisartan, by far, the most prominent activator of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor\u2010\u03b3, a mediator of a host of favourable metabolic actions [33, 96]. In the ONTARGET study, mean BP was lower in both the telmisartan group (0.9/0.6 mm Hg greater reduction) and the combination therapy group (2.4/1.4 mm Hg greater reduction) than in the ramipril group. Telmisartan was equivalent to ramipril in terms of primary outcomes in patients with vascular disease or diabetes. The combination of telmisartan and ramipril was associated with more adverse events (hypotension, renal dysfunction) without an increase in benefit. The recent introduction of the first orally effective renin inhibitor, aliskiren, has raised additional interest in new possibilities of almost complete blockade of RAS as a tool (Fig. 5), perhaps, more effective than earlier, in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease [92, 93, 97, 98]. Early reports on the use of aliskiren are promising, showing at least, an antihypertensive effect of aliskiren potent as those of other antihypertensive drugs [93].
