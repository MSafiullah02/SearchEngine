            "text": "The rapid expansion of methods and data available for landscape-oriented epidemiological studies has considerably transformed health-environment research over the last two decades. It is now customary to include landuse/landcover data sensed from satellites, climate data obtained from global repositories of networked weather stations (e.g., WorldClim) or from satellite sensors such as the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission that provides daily rainfall data for all of Asia. Also, these data products are increasingly available at a global scale, and as \u2018pre-processed\u2019 information products consumable by spatial models. For example, the WorldPop project (http://www.worldpop.org.uk/) aims to provide high-resolution spatially explicit demographic data across South and Central Americas, Asia, and Africa (Tatem 2014). Geographically granular case data aggregated over small health areas are also commonplace, both in studies in the developed and developing worlds. Data describing other features of the environment such as roads, river networks, water bodies, built-up areas, health care service locations are also increasingly available in even remote parts of the world. We are on the cusp of real-time global-scale epidemiology, whereby \u2018feeds\u2019 describing the important features of the environment for health is updated in real-time. For diseases with immediate environmental components of risk (e.g., arboviruses, heat-related illnesses), the benefits of timely updating of spatially explicit information on risk factors provide opportunities for highly granular public health responses and data-driven policy formulations. Further, diseases with longer latencies and more complex risk profiles also stand to benefit from enhanced environmental information. With this data-rich environment in machine-readable forms, and the capacity for automated model-building, it is important to structure analysis using such large, spatially explicit information sources within a broader framework for understanding disease-landscape dynamics (e.g., Lambin et al. 2010).",

The recent cholera outbreak in Haiti provides a salient example, where volunteers on the ground and on the other side of the world contributed data and expertise to the mapping of local environment in support of disease control and health programs. Citizen-generated data is also increasingly used in empirical studies themselves, for example\u2014actively in mobile health-reporting apps such as \u2018outbreaks near me\u2019 (Freifeld et al. 2010) as well as passively, when web-search data are repurposed for syndromic surveillance of seasonal influenza (Hulth et al. 2009), in support of what is often called \u2018epidemiological intelligence\u2019. In landscape epidemiological research, all of these datasets can be accessed, mapped, and integrated via their geographies to derive factors affecting disease risk, and the cumulative risk distribution in space and time.",

            "text": "Reviews of \u2018GIS in Epidemiology\u2019 have not provided this sort of framework. Many reviews have rightly focused on broad overviews of spatial analysis or GIS methods and disease (Cromley 2003; Rytk\u00f6nen 2004), and/or their application to areas such as animal disease (Freier et al. 2007), and other areas such as surveillance (Robertson et al. 2010). The shortcomings of GIS approaches to health research and specifically the disconnect between analytical methods and parameters such as neighbourhood weights matrices in disease mapping models, and their epidemiological meaning was highlighted by Yang et al. (2013), whereas Fritz et al. (2013) review and compare methods for handling point event data in spatial health research. Barrett et al. (2013) reviewed the scope for big data to improve understanding and tracking of health-related behaviours and outcomes. And while the emphasis in health geography over the last two decades has focused largely on social determinants (Kearns 1993; Kearns and Moon 2002), these approaches have bifurcated somewhat from approaches dominant in spatially oriented infectious disease epidemiology, which have remained quantitative and modelling/biomedically oriented. Rather than debate the relative merits of these paradigms, it is instructive to re-examine the motivation for these studies in the first place, and perhaps contextualize these differing research frames within a common framework. Recent work relating infectious disease risk to climate change has introduced ideas from adaptation research such as vulnerability and adaptive capacity that are conditioned on socioeconomic processes (Kienberger and Hagenlocher 2014) is an example of a new generation of integrative spatial studies of health and disease that may be bridging this gap. In this paper, we present a framework oriented around knowledge uses and existing tools in order to provide a methodological grounding for new integrative studies in landscape epidemiology (LE).",

The backbone of GIS\u2014relational database management systems\u2014has provided the technology for this historically, although rarely identified explicitly in research related to LE studies. However, given the increasingly granularity of satellite data, the volume of mobile sensor data, and the advent of \u2018big data\u2019 generally (and real-time epidemiology), these technologies are starting to become insufficient to handle the current data-rich environment. New geocomputational methods for spatial data storage and access may be required for new research in landscape epidemiology\u2014including spatial indexes, data compression algorithms, and knowledge discovery algorithms. For example, social media data streams are by definition \u2018always on\u2019\u2014and extracting and storing a subset of these defined by space and time into a relational database for the purposes of on-line surveillance of new disease reports induces a delay in the processing chain. Application programming interfaces (APIs) as a way of accessing data portals algorithmically partially sidestep this issue, but these tools are by their nature reserved for researchers with advanced technical skills. Consequently, the \u2018data processing step\u2019 is an increasingly relevant but frequently overlooked component of LE studies, as data integration based on geography is often required prior to undertaking any analysis. Complex processing chains that incorporate web-based geographic data repositories, cloud-based storage and analysis, and delivery of results via web-map services may encompass the computational tools of neogeography (e.g., OpenLayers, cartoDB, D3, leaflet), open data portals and cloud services (e.g., Amazon EC2) and a myriad other software tools and packages. Situating these methods and tools within their functional context relevant for LE will provide an organizational mapping to aid understanding of this complex and rapidly evolving landscape.",

While scale has increasingly been emphasized in the health geography literatures, much of this work has been conceptual and theoretical rather than applied. While laying the necessary theoretical foundations for a multi-scale approach to understanding health and disease in populations is an important first step, concrete tools and methodologies are required in order to operationalize these ideas for applied LE. Geocomputational methods are well-suited to multi-scale analysis, however there are several approaches to multi-scale analysis that can be taken, and little guidance is available to researchers aiming to take a multi-scale approach to LE. Characterizing features of the landscape at multiple scales is perhaps one of the most widely employed tactics, whether it is compositional factors (e.g., percent forest cover) or configurational properties (e.g., edge density, fragmentation). Identifying \u2018zones\u2019 of scale consistency and abrupt changes in landscape properties with scale can provide insight into the appropriate spatial scale of investigation (Wu 2004). This approach is consistent with the landscape ecology paradigm of hierarchical patch dynamics, which may provide a conceptual basis for investigating landscape influences on health in patchy landscapes.",

Our aim in proposing the framework that follows is to more clearly organize current methods, provide a structure for research design, and more concretely link methods to knowledge translation and use. Surveillance can provide health workers with the baseline knowledge required to judge when and where unusual events are taking place, which can catalyze early responses to outbreaks or changes in disease incidence. Knowledge of risk factors can contribute to formulating effective interventions, and identifying areas and populations vulnerable to disease. Once knowledge of landscape influences on health and disease is established, this can be applied and integrated into healthcare delivery systems in contextually appropriate ways (Lai et al. 2008).",

In practice, this step of analysis might be used to develop spatial variables that are used in a study aimed at the \u2018characterize the assemblage\u2019 step, or may be the objective of analysis. Examples of flows include the movement of mosquito vectors with climate change, movement of cattle to markets in a region, commuting patterns of residents of a large metropolitan area, and the flow of capital into resource extraction industries in individual countries or regions. While we don\u2019t constrain our description to physical flows (e.g., diurnal movement of people within the city), we emphasize aspects of flows that can be represented and or analyzed within a geocomputational framework. Often, non-geographic flows have important properties and expressions that are embedded within geographic space.

In geocomputation, learning and behavior are increasingly relevant concepts, as algorithms are developed that learn relationships across space from continuous data streams (Young 2013). Many of the dynamical models of mathematical modelling center on feedbacks between system components, and estimation of critical epidemiological parameters. While geography has traditionally been excluded or assumed away in these models, the field of spatial statistics has developed spatially explicit extensions to classical epidemiological models (Riley et al. 2015). However, for LE the majority of approaches that are focused on representing connectivity and positive and negative feedback between system components fall into the category of conceptual modelling approaches rather than empirical/mathematical modelling. The translation of conceptual models of complex systems to workable mathematical models that can be fit to observational data is one of the most challenging aspects of GLE. In practice, there is often iteration between the approaches described in Tables 2 and 3 and those in Table 4. Feedbacks can also exist within complex systems designed to represent a health domain that are created as loosely coupled ensembles of simple models\u2014which are integrated with an aim of intelligence, situational awareness, or monitoring.\n\n\n",

Daily rainfall records were tabulated into monthly totals for each of the 446 stations, and each month was interpolated using TPS function in the Fields package in R (Nychka et al. 2015). Averaging interpolated total rainfall for each month over each MOH area provided concurrent estimates of rainfall and reported cases of leptospirosis over equivalent geographical units. Surveillance data for weekly reported cases of leptospirosis by MOH area were aggregated by year, and standardized by population to produce estimates of incidence per 100,000 for the year 2008 in each geographical unit.

The timing of this spike is consistent with peaks in cases in previous years, however the magnitude is much greater and worthy of further investigation. Examining the rainfall patterns over 2008 evident in Fig. 3, the most striking pattern is the unseasonably intense and extensive rainfall that occurred in March 2008. Whether this unusually high amount of rainfall occurred was related to the spike in reported cases on leptospirosis is unclear. Correlation analysis revealed both positive and negative associations between incidence and rainfall (Table 7). The highest rank monthly correlations in terms of t-statistic magnitude were July (positive), March (negative), and April (positive). The magnitudes of the correlations were not high; indicating limited predictive potential at least at the scales investigated here. Direct comparison of month-to-month correlations would provide a more robust indicator of the relationship\u2014however power is also reduced due to the smaller numbers and smaller effect sizes. Month-to-month cross correlations indicated both positive and negative associations (Fig. 4). While some interesting spatial patterns emerge from this analysis, the evidence is insufficient to explain the outbreak in 2008, as key information is missing. Note that our previous modelling work of landscape factors related to clusters of high risk found associations between paddy areas, small agricultural holdings, distance to cities and distance to rivers (Robertson et al. 2012).\n\n\n\n",

A functional analyses would examine the flows, feedbacks, and events that would describe the movement of people, their interaction with the health care system and care-seeking behaviours, application of control mechanisms, distributions of animal reservoirs and their habitats or production chains in the case of livestock, and individual interactions with paddy fields.
