            "text": "Mathematical models of epidemiological systems enable investigation of and predictions about potential disease outbreaks. However, commonly used models are often highly simplified representations of incredibly complex systems. Because of these simplifications, the model output, of say new cases of a disease over time, or when an epidemic will occur, may be inconsistent with available data. In this case, we must improve the model, especially if we plan to make decisions based on it that could affect human health and safety, but direct improvements are often beyond our reach. In this work, we explore this problem through a case study of the Zika outbreak in Brazil in 2016. We propose an embedded discrepancy operator-a modification to the model equations that requires modest information about the system and is calibrated by all relevant data. We show that the new enriched model demonstrates greatly increased consistency with real data. Moreover, the method is general enough to easily apply to many other mathematical models in epidemiology. a) rebeccam@colorado.edu; rebeccaem.github.io b) americo@ime.uerj.br; www.americocunha.org",

            "text": "Potential epidemics of communicable diseases are a major health concern of the modern world, especially as city density, air and water pollution, and worldwide travel steadily increase. A stark example of this is the global Coronavirus outbreak, already responsible for more than 2000 deaths around the world at time of this article's submission, and more than 13,000 at time of revision, approximately one month later. When faced with a potential outbreak, decision-makers such as health officials and medical professionals rely on mathematical models to aid their decision-making processes. But oftentimes these models are not consistent with the dynamical system they are designed to represent. The discrepancy between the output of a model and the real system is then a serious impediment, as it may decrease our confidence in the model, or even invalidate it entirely, so that it can no longer be used to aid in decision-making. When such a discrepancy is observed, we, as modelers, must either improve the model or somehow account for the discrepancy itself. While a direct model improvement is usually the most desirable solution, how to do so may be infeasible because of computational reasons, time constraints, or lack of domain knowledge. This paper provides a systematic method to instead account for the discrepancy itself, explored via a case study of the Brazilian Zika epidemic of 2016. The method is not a correction of the model output to data, but rather a modification of the model equations themselves by a so-called embedded discrepancy operator. The operator is designed with three critical properties in mind: interpretability, domain-consistency, and robustness. We show that including the embedded discrepancy operator greatly increases the fidelity of the model, so that model output and real data are now in fact consistent.",

In some cases, these simplifications do not preclude the use of the model to understand, investigate, and make decisions and predictions about the system. The quintessential example of this comes from the domain of classical mechanics: Newtonian mechanics ignores quantum and relativistic effects but, over a wide domain of masses and energies, provides a completely adequate model to describe the motion of macroscopic objects. Outside this domain, however, quantum or relativistic effects are no longer negligible, and Newtonian mechanics fails.",

This discrepancy is revealed during model validation, a process by which we check that the mathematical model is a reliable representation of reality. Without accounting for the discrepancy, one cannot trust the model output, much less use it to make predictions or decisions. In this case, there are two immediate options: (1) Improve the model directly, i.e., from first principles or by including additional information; and (2) Represent the model discrepancy itself. While option 1 is usually desirable, it may not be feasible due to computational constraints, or because we in fact lack the knowledge to directly improve the model. Then we are left with option 2-represent the model discrepancy.",

A response discrepancy function corrects model output (or response) to data. Typically, an additive function on the model output is calibrated to data, either point-wise or with a parametric form. An advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented even if the model is a black box, that is, one only needs access to model output, not the model itself. There are also disadvantages. In essence, a response discrep-ancy function builds a better interpolation to a single dataset, over the range of usable data. Thus, this approach provides no basis for extrapolation, to, for example, make a prediction about the probability of an epidemic next year. Furthermore, the action of this bias function is not interpretable, as it lies outside the model equations.",

The inclusion of the embedded discrepancy operator into the original, or reduced model, yields an enriched model. In essence, the enriched model takes advantage of both mechanistic and statistical modeling: it retains the reduced mechanistic model, and incorporates a general, statistically calibrated discrepancy model. Of course, this intrusive approach highly depends on the context. Here, we investigate the value of an embedded discrepancy operator in the context of epidemiology modeling. Mathematical modeling of disease spread and outbreaks has a long and rich history; see [2] [3] [4] [5] , to name just a few. One of the most common classes of these models consists of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), whose state variables include populations of the host (here, humans) and the disease carrier, or vector. These populations are further specified as either Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, or Recovered, leading to thus-named SEIR models. 6 These models are relatively simple to implement and understand. Model parameters allow for the specification of transmission rates, incubation times, etc.",

In previous work, after calibration of model parameters, the reduced model captured major tendencies of the outbreak. This was a major improvement compared to the reduced model with parameter values as suggested by current literature, which bore almost no usable resemblance to the real epidemic data. However, the calibrated model was still insufficient to precisely capture the dynamical behavior of the Zika outbreak. The current work extends previous works of embedded model discrepancy, used in the contexts of combustion 8 and ecological models 9 , to the current domain of epidemiology. The discrepancy model is embedded within the coupled model differential equations, and the introduced discrepancy parameters are calibrated to available data. The enriched model is shown to greatly outperform the original model.",

In addition, the actual discrepancy was known exactly between each reduced model and the corresponding data-generating model; some of that information was used to further constrain the discrepancy model parameters. Thus, the previous paper provided no guarantee that this method would work in a highly applied, real-world model scenario without those strong assumptions.",

At the same time, the issue of under-reported cases does obviously play an important role during the model validation process. We try to disentangle the two problems-observational error and model error-by first considering only model error, and later allowing for both model error and significant under-reporting.

            "text": "Clearly the reduced model, given \u03b8 n parameter values, is a poor representation of reality. After observing such a discrepancy, the authors of 7 performed a sophisticated calibration of the model parameters \u03b8 , using the Trust-Region-Reflective (TRR) method 15, 16 . Following that method, and using the public data to calibrate, two slightly different results are obtained by imposing a different set of constraints on possible parameters values. The model outputs after both calibrations are shown in Figure 2 . Although the model output is now much closer to the data, still, a detectable inconsistency persists. To be specific, note that after about week 30, the difference is tens of thousands of new cases of humans infected by Zika. From a modeling perspective, the salient point is that the model is unable to capture the dynamical behavior of the outbreak, even after calibration. Assuming (as we are for now), that the given data is correct, this suggests that the problem lies with model itself. Indeed, there are several possible sources of model error, that may impact not only this specific Zika model but many other epidemiological models. First, these SEIR models are not built from first principles, but rather from assumptions about interactive behavior, empirical information, and domain scientists' intuition and experience. Second, these models provide a continuous, deterministic description of discrete interactions, which naturally involve some stochasticity 17 . With large enough populations, though, this should not be a problem. Third, diseases do not spread in a closed system of host and vector. Rather, the spread of a disease involves other species such as livestock and non-human primates 18 . Fourth, other modes of transmission are possible, such as sexual interaction 19, 20 and blood transfusion 21 . Finally, there could certainly be additional time-or spatially-dependent effects, such as migrations and local dynamics 22, 23 , collective behavior and timedelayed synchronization dynamics 24 . Some modelers assume power-law dynamics of the networks 25 , while others use fractional derivatives to describe relevant dynamics 26 . Instead, this model assumes time-independent parameters, and only models populations over time, not space. In summary, the spread of a contagious disease is an incredibly complex problem, and it remains unclear what is critically missing from the model or how to best improve it directly from epidemiological information. Here, then, we can turn to the field of model ",

Roughly speaking, the parameters of the enrichment can be seen as \"gains\" that adjust to drive the epidemic curve generated by the model towards the real observational curve. These parameters are identified via Bayesian inference, with prior distributions that ad- To understand more deeply why this competition between corrective signals produces such an effective correction, consider the injection and removal of information (i.e., energy) in the system, as well as its flow between the different coordinates of the state (groups of human and mosquito populations). To make an analogy with the dynamics of mechanical oscillators, the feedback effects proportional to the state derivative produce a kind of \"viscous force,\" which introduces (via positive feedback) or removes (via negative feedback) information into or from the epidemiological state variables. Furthermore, the terms proportional to the system state correspond to a kind of \"restoring force,\" which redistributes information among the different population groups. The intensity of this additional information flow between the different coordinates of the system state is controlled by the new time It should be noted that the approach presented in the paper is not control theory in the literal sense, since no information from the biological system is obtained in real-time, nor is an action signal sent to the real system to adjust its epidemic curve trajectory. Therefore, the observability and controllability issues related to the real system are not taken into account. The notion of duality between parameters and gains is explored above only as a way to pave an initial reasonable interpretation of how the discrepancy operator acts to correct the model's response, by promoting additional information flows between the different compartments of the populations.",

While beyond the scope of this paper, a deep exploration of interpretability, connections to linear feedback theory, and an explanation of these discrepancy terms in a physiological sense will be the subject of immediate future work.",
