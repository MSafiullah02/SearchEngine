            "text": "The Meloidae is a widespread family of Tenebrionoidea found throughout the World except New Zealand, Antarctica and most Polynesian islands. It includes more than 120 genera and ca 3000 species (Bologna and Pinto 2001). This family is well known for its production of cantharidin, a chemical defensive substance and hypermetabolic larval development, common to all taxa except possibly the basal subfamily Eleticinae (Bologna 1991; Pinto et al. 1996; Bologna et al. 2001). Phylogenetic studies using morphological and bionomic characters (Bologna & Pinto 2001) recognised four subfamilies, Eleticinae, Nemognathinae, Tetraonycinae and Meloinae, while analyses based on molecular and combined characters (Bologna et al. 2008) recognised only three, the tetraonycines being referred as a tribe in the Meloinae.",

Only 25 taxonomic papers have been published on this fauna, the latest almost one century ago (Lea 1914, 1917; Blair 1920). Thus far the only genera recorded from Australia are Horia Fabricius, 1787 in the tribe Horiini, and Palaestra Laporte de Castelnau, 1840, Palestrida Hope, 1842 and Zonitis Fabricius, 1775 in the Nemognathini. Studies showing the presence of additional horiine and nemognathine genera common to other Gondwanian areas, as well as a complex of possibly new genera close to Palaestra will be the focus of a separate contribution (MA Bologna et al. unpublished 2007\u20132010). Preliminary work also suggests that there remains a considerable number of undescribed species on the continent.",

            "text": "The morphology of meloid first\u2010instar larvae (also called triungulins) has been useful for phylogenetic studies (e.g. Cros 1940; MacSwain 1956; Bologna & Pinto 2001). All Nemognathinae triungulins are phoretic with the possible exception of the relatively plesiomorphic genus Stenodera Eschscholtz, 1818 (Bologna et al. 2002), and consequently their morphology is less heterogeneous than in the nominate subfamily (e.g. Bologna & Pinto 2001;Di Giulio & Bologna 2007). Triungulins of Australian blister beetles have never been described specifically. Silvestri (1920) cited, and superficially figured and described a phoretic triungulin collected near Adelaide on a Zygentoma of the family Nicoletiidae (Subtrinemura excelsa (Silvestri 1920)). A biological association of blister beetles with silverfishes is unknown and this record could have been accidental. We failed to locate this triungulin in the Silvestri collection at the Portici University (Napoli). More recently 1984, 1987) reported triungulins phoretic on Australian Stenotritidae bees. These larvae, incorporated by Bologna and Pinto (2001) in their phylogenetic study of Meloidae (as sp. H), are described here together with other larvae of Nemognathini collected in the field, and of Palaestra rufipennis (Westwood, 1841) obtained recently from eggs. Larvae from one of these field collections also were incorporated in the 2001 phylogenetic study (as sp. K).",

            "text": "The prominent tooth\u2010like transverse ridges of the mandibles and two pairs of ocelli clearly assign Group 1 larvae to the Nemognathinae as characterised by MacSwain (1956). However, assignment to the tribe Nemognathini remains tentative. These larvae differ from all known Nemognathini in lacking modified spiracles on abdominal segment VIII and from most in having hair\u2010like caudal setae (Fig. 3a). Both features are believed to be primitive for the subfamily. Other primitive traits, the presence of a well\u2010developed epicranial suture and a line of dehiscence on the pronotum (Fig. 1a,b), also occur in several genera in the subfamily. Group 1 larvae share these traits with the Horiini, considered a subfamily by MacSwain (1956) and only a tribe in the more recent literature, but they lack toothed tarsal claws, the only clearly derived larval feature of horiines. Bologna and Pinto (2001) placed clade L, which included two of the group species studied here (A1, B1), in the Nemognathini based on the presence of a dense tuft of setae on the epipharynx (char. 20), a feature absent in the Horiini. However, the monophyly of Group 1 is inadequately supported. The only character believed to be derived is the dorsal position of abdominal spiracle I. This condition, known to occur in several genera of Meloinae, has not been reported in other nemognathines. Other features supporting monophyly of clade L (which would now also include Palaestra) in Bologna and Pinto (2001) either are reversals (chars. 17, 46, 49) or now are known in other nemognathine genera (char. 85). The study of adult traits and additional larvae should assist in the taxonomic positioning of this assemblage. What is clear is that the larvae of Group 1 species are thus far unique to Australia.",

As in all genera described thus far the spiracles of abdominal segment VIII are placed on projecting horn\u2010like evaginations (Fig. 3b) (MacSwain 1956; Bologna & Pinto 2001). Within the tribe, Group 2 appears to be most similar to genera which MacSwain placed in the Zonitides (Zonitis, Gnathium Kirby, 1818, Leptopalpus Gu\u00e9rin\u2010M\u00e9neville, 1834, and Pseudozonitis Dillon, 1950), and Bologna and Pinto in clade K. In this assemblage, as in all Group 2 representatives, the epicranial suture is absent as is the line of dehiscence on the pronotum (Fig. 1c,d). The number of tooth\u2010like transverse ridges on the mandibles also is reduced (<5) (Fig. 4c,d). The distinct caudal setae of species of Group 2 (5, 1) however separates it from larvae thus far described in these other genera (Fig. 3b). This character may represent a primitive condition in these Australian Nemognathini of clade K that also occurs in some Palaearctic genera such as Sitaris Latreille, 1802 and Apalus Fabricius, 1775.",

Ongoing studies of adults (A Bologna, JD Pinto and F Turco unpubl. data 2007\u20132010) document the presence in Australia also of Synhoria Kolbe, 1897 (Horiini) and Zonitoschema P\u00e9ringuey, 1909 (Nemognathini). They show clearly that many of these species (Z. purpureipennis, Z. violacea Hope, 1842, Z. violaceipennis Waterhouse, 1875, and many others) are placed inappropriately in Zonitis and instead are allied more closely to Palaestra. Morphotypes A and B (Group 1) probably represent this lineage which is known currently only from Australia, New Guinea, Micronesia, Sri Lanka and East Africa. Morphotypes C and D (Group 2) are more cosmopolitan, with basic features characterising Nemognathini from other parts of the world. They are probably assignable to Zonitis and/or Zonitoschema or possibly to undescribed genera.",
