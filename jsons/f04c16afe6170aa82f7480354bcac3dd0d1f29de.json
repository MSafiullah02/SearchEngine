            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enteric coronavirus causing high morbidity and mortality in porcine herds worldwide, that possesses both enteric and respiratory tropism. The ability to replicate in the enteric tract directly correlates with virulence, as TGEVs with an exclusive respiratory tropism are attenuated. The tissue tropism is determined by spike (S) protein, although the molecular bases for enteric tropism remain to be fully characterized. Both pAPN and sialic acid binding domains (aa 506-655 and 145-155, respectively) are necessary but not sufficient for enteric tract infection. Using a TGEV infectious cDNA and enteric (TGEV-SC11) or respiratory (TGEV-SPTV) isolates, encoding a full-length S protein, a set of chimeric recombinant viruses, with a sequential modification in S protein amino terminus, was engineered. In vivo tropism, either enteric, respiratory or both, was studied by inoculating three-day-old piglets and analyzing viral titers in lung and gut. The data indicated that U655>G change in S gene (S219A in S protein) was required to confer enteric tropism to a respiratory virus that already contains the pAPN and sialic acid binding domains in its S protein. Moreover, an engineered virus containing U655>G and a 6 nt insertion at position 1124 (Y374-T375insND in S protein) was genetically stable after passage in cell cultures, and increased virus titers in gut by 1000-fold. We postulated that the effect of these residues in enteric tropism may be mediated by the modification of both glycosaminoglycan binding and S protein structure.",

            "text": "Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is a TGEV mutant that naturally appeared in the field, lacking enteric tropism [23, 24] . PRCV contains a 227 amino acid deletion in the N-terminus of S protein (Figure 1) , strongly suggesting that this region of TGEV S protein is important for the enteric tropism. In addition, we have previously shown that S protein binding to the host cell receptor, the porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), was not enough to determine the enteric tropism, as both TGEV and PRCV bind pAPN [10] . By comparing TGEV and PRCV binding to cell surface sialoglycoproteins, it was proposed that TGEV binding to this type of molecules may facilitate enteric tract infection [25] . Nevertheless, the sialic acid binding domain identified in TGEV S protein is conserved in several TGEV-derived respiratory viruses with a full-length S gene, such as TGEV-PTV (Figure 1 ), suggesting the existence of additional determinants of enteric tropism in the S protein. PRCV genome also contains deletions in the C-terminus of S gene, in genes 3a, 3b, and the ORF1a region encoding nsp3. Then, the contribution of other S protein domains or other viral proteins to enteric tropism was for a long time an open question [26] . In fact, the relevance of S protein N-terminus in TGEV enteric tropism has even recently been questioned [27] .",

            "text": "Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is a TGEV mutant that naturally appeared in the field, lacking enteric tropism [23, 24] . PRCV contains a 227 amino acid deletion in the N-terminus of S protein (Figure 1 ), strongly suggesting that this region of TGEV S protein is important for the enteric tropism. In addition, we have previously shown that S protein binding to the host cell receptor, the porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), was not enough to determine the enteric tropism, as both TGEV and PRCV bind pAPN [10] . By comparing TGEV and PRCV binding to cell surface sialoglycoproteins, it was proposed that TGEV binding to this type of molecules may facilitate enteric tract infection [25] . Nevertheless, the sialic acid binding domain identified in TGEV S protein is conserved in several TGEV-derived respiratory viruses with a full-length S gene, such as TGEV-PTV (Figure 1 ), suggesting the existence of additional determinants of enteric tropism in the S protein. PRCV genome also contains deletions in the C-terminus of S gene, in genes 3a, 3b, and the ORF1a region encoding nsp3. Then, the contribution of other S protein domains or other viral proteins to enteric tropism was for a long time an open question [26] . In fact, the relevance of S protein N-terminus in TGEV enteric tropism has even recently been questioned [27] .

The respiratory TGEV virus already contained the domains binding to pAPN (aa 506-655) and sialic acid (aa 145-155), which were necessary but not sufficient for enteric tract infection. Our data clearly demonstrated that the nature of the nucleotide at position 655 of S gene (leading to a S219A mutation in S protein) was required to confer enteric tropism to the respiratory TGEV. Moreover, a 6 nt insertion at position 1124 (leading to Y374-T375insND in S protein) led to a virus highly stable in cell cultures and increased by 1000-fold the virus titers in the enteric tract.",

Based on previous data from our group [15, 16] , the attention was focused in the nucleotide substitutions located at the N-terminus of S protein. To identify the determinants for TGEV enteric tropism, a series of chimeric S proteins was designed, containing different SC11 domains into a SPTV background (Figure 2A ). These mutants were introduced in the TGEV infectious cDNA, leading to the rescue of a set of recombinant viruses (rTGEV-Rs).

Passage two after cDNA transfection (p2) and passage eight (p8) viruses were used to infect piglets and virus titers in intestine were determined. As previously observed, rTGEV-SC11 p8 virus had decreased virus titer in the gut compared with p2 (Table 1 ). In contrast, no significant difference in virus titer in enteric tract was observed between p2 and p8 rTGEV-Rs7 virus (Table 1) . These data were further confirmed when rTGEV-Rs7 was used as an expression vector and virus was passed 16 times in cell cultures maintaining S protein sequence [32] . Therefore, Rs7 S protein sequence would be very useful to generate vaccine candidates that can be propagated in cell cultures without losing the enteric tropism and, therefore, maintaining all the immunogenic potential [1] . These vaccine candidates would be both for TGEV, including attenuating mutations [30] , or for other viruses if TGEV is used as a viral vector [32] .

Passage two after cDNA transfection (p2) and passage eight (p8) viruses were used to infect piglets and virus titers in intestine were determined. As previously observed, rTGEV-SC11 p8 virus had decreased virus titer in the gut compared with p2 (Table 1 ). In contrast, no significant difference in virus titer in enteric tract was observed between p2 and p8 rTGEV-Rs7 virus (Table 1) . These data were further confirmed when rTGEV-Rs7 was used as an expression vector and virus was passed 16 times in cell cultures maintaining S protein sequence [32] . Therefore, Rs7 S protein sequence would be very useful to generate vaccine candidates that can be propagated in cell cultures without losing the enteric tropism and, therefore, maintaining all the rTGEV-SC11 (3 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10 7 (4 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10 8 (5 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10 6 (2 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10 6 (5 \u00b1 1.3) \u00d7 10 6 (5 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10 5 rTGEV-Rs7 (5 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 8 (3 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 8 (4 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10 7 (8 \u00b1 2.9) \u00d7 10 6 (8 \u00b1 1.7) \u00d7 10 6 (4 \u00b1 5.1) \u00d7 10 6",

            "text": "In agreement with previous observations [16, 30] , our data indicated that the presence of sialic acid and pAPN binding domains was necessary but not sufficient for TGEV enteric tract infection. Additional requirements for enteric tropism were identified in this work. We have engineered a mutated rTGEV-Rs7 enteric virus that differs from a respiratory recombinant virus (rTGEV-SPTV) in just two locations in the S gene: U655>G and a 6 nt insertion at position 1124, leading to S219A and a Y374_T375insND insertion in S protein, respectively. It is worth pointing out that the 6 nt insertion was also present in the respiratory PRCV, although this virus lacks the sialic acid binding domain (Figure 1) . Interestingly, comparing viruses containing both sialic acid and pAPN binding domains showed that, as occurs in respiratory rTGEV-SPTV virus, many TGEV enteric isolates contain a deletion at position 1124, such as strains WH-1 (GenBank HQ462571), USA/Z/1986 (GenBank KX900393), HX [33] or TH-98 (GenBank KU729220), strongly suggesting that this sequence alone is not a determinant of enteric tropism. By comparing our results on rTGEV-Rs5 and rTGEV-Rs7 viruses, it can be concluded that the presence of Y374_T375insND significantly increased the growth of TGEV in the enteric tract (around 1000-fold). In addition, it could also be strongly suggested that this sequence insertion may help virus stability in cell culture.",

            "text": "In contrast, U655>G mutation was a determinant of the enteric tract infection, as it was required for gut infection of a virus already containing sialic acid and pAPN binding domains. This mutation led to a S219A change in S protein, resulting in the elimination of a predicted glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment site. Then we postulated that, during adaptation to cell cultures, TGEV viruses acquire the U655>G mutation to increase GAG binding. GAG association with TGEV has been described [34, 35] . And the use of GAGs as attachment factors in cell cultures has been described for other enteric CoV, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [36] . Very often, the interaction between viruses and GAGs traps virus progeny, inhibiting virus release and spread [37] . We hypothesized that the cell-culture adapted virus, containing the additional GAG binding site, may have decreased ability to traffic through the enteric tract to reach its target tissues and, as a consequence, has reduced virulence. Similar findings were described for other RNA viruses, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) [38] , alphaviruses [39] [40] [41] , and flaviviruses [42] [43] [44] [45] , reinforcing our postulate.",

This fact, together with the observation that non-engineered mutations introduced in vivo into the S1 domain of the spike protein of rTGEV-Rs3 and rTGEV-Rs4 viruses abrogated enteric tropism, suggests that structural constrains in the S protein of the N-terminal region may have a role in the determination of the enteric tropism. Unfortunately, the structural information on TGEV S protein is limited to the APN binding region (aa 506 to 655) ( Figure 5A ) [10] , not allowing the location of S219A mutation in the experimentally determined S protein structure. As an alternative, S1 domains (aa 1 to 818) were modeled using RaptorX web server [46] . The prediction showed limited differences between the SPTV and Rs7 structures ( Figure 5A ). One of the biggest differences was in the vicinity of Ser219, changing the predicted orientation of the loop including aa 219 ( Figure 5B ). Moreover, this structural perturbation may also affect some loops in antigenic site B and the sialic acid binding domain ( Figure 5B) . Interestingly, the Y374_T375insND also may produce a structural change affecting antigenic site D and S protein loops which are close to the pAPN binding residues ( Figure 5C ). Therefore, it could be postulated that S219A and Y374_T375insND mutations, present in rTGEV-Rs7, may structurally favor interactions with host cell receptors.",

The obtained plasmids were subsequently digested with NcoI and XhoI and the fragments were cloned in pGEMT-SPTV plasmid, containing nucleotides 20,287 to 24,811 of TGEV-SPTV genome and engineered PacI and MluI restriction sites [30] , generating plasmids pGEMT-Rs1, pGEMT-Rs2, pGEMT-Rs3, pGEMT-Rs4, and pGEMT-Rs5. To obtain plasmid pGEMT-Rs6, pGEMT-SC11-1881 was digested with NcoI and XhoI and this fragment was cloned intro the same sites in pGEMT-SPTV plasmid. Plasmid pGEMT-Rs7 was obtained by overlapping PCR. Briefly, a 1095 bp PCR product was amplified using pGEMT-Rs5 as a template and oligonucleotides S-77(Pac) VS (5 -CCTTAATTAAGAAGGGTAAGTTGCTC-3 ) and S998RS (5 -CGTCTACAGTATTATTTAAAACAGCACC-3 ). A second 672 bp PCR product was amplified using pGEMT-Rs6 as a template and oligonucleotides S998VS (5 -GGTGCTGTTTTAAA TAATACTGTAGACG-3') and S1640RS (5'-GATGTTACTTAATGTTGAGG-3'). Both PCR products were combined and amplified using S-77(Pac) VS and S1640RS oligonucleotides. The obtained 1739 PCR product was digested with PacI and XhoI and cloned into the same sites in pGEMT-SPTV plasmid. Finally, pGEMT-RS plasmids were digested with PacI and MluI and the fragments were cloned into the same sites in pBAC-TGEV-SPTV [30] to obtain the corresponding infectious cDNAs. All cloning steps were checked by sequencing of the PCR fragments and cloning junctions. For each mutant sequence, two independent cDNAs were constructed. To rescue parental control viruses, pBAC-TGEV-SPTV and pBAC-TGEV-SC11 [30] were used.",
