Supposing that, 90% of the excess of hospitalizations is due to COVID-19; based on the observation that the year of 2019 is about 10% bigger than the background, meaning we could see this behavior on 2020 as well; that marks around 10023 to 10108 hospitalizations by infections of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which reflects on 52752 to 53200 infections between 21/03/2020 and 26/03/2020 (According to the average time taken to hospitalization).

With these estimations, we may find the percentage of lost cases on these countries until 28th March by comparing the estimate number of people infected with the official data available at 28th March. Relating these percentages with the number of tests done per 1000 habitants and the number of tests done per day per 1000 habitants, we got an linear relation between the number of total tests done per 1000 habitants and per day per 1000 habitants on a country and the percentage of lost cases ( Figure 4 and 5). The number of points on each graph is different because, although the study considered 11 countries, not all of them had data of tests per day available on [18] . We also compared the undocumented cases with the progression of the outbreak on each country and the day on which the non-pharmaceutical interventions were imposed, but found no correlation. We evaluated the effect of the increasing rate of testing as well, but it had no observable effect. From this relation, a country needs to perform 4 (0.94 -17) tests per day per 1000 habitants. Here, the large margin for the higher values of testing arises from the low density of data points on the bigger values of the x-axis on figure 4.",
