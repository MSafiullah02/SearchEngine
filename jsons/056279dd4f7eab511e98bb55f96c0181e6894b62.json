Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is main pathogens responsible for piglets viral diarrhea. Knockout the host cellular surface receptor for TGEV may be an effective way to accelerate the breeding of resistant pigs. In this study, we applied site-specific editing pAPN which is effective in swine testis (ST) cells. Site-specific editing of pAPN reduced TGEV proliferation in ST cells by 96%-99% at different time periods post-infection. Next, the site-specific editing of pAPN porcine fetal fibroblasts were produced, and then the cell colonies were used as donor cells to generate the site-specific editing of pAPN pigs. Our research findings will not only offer a more thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of piglet diarrhea and lay the foundation for breeding TGEVresistant piglets, but also understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in coronaviral infections.

In spite of vaccine therapy, TGEV infections continue to be a concern in the porcine industry. TGEV enters the host by first attaching its glycoprotein (S protein) to the host cellular surface receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) (Delmas et al., 1992) .",
