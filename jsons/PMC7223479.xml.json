We emphasise that measures of lethality are hardly interpretable solely as characteristics of the disease but also depend on the continuous availability and quality of care. The consequences of a pandemic are not only limited to covid-19 related deaths but rather contribute in an indirect way to the potentially avoidable deaths due to extreme triage of limited resources in crisis situations.29\n",

Potential explanations for reduced spread of the virus include the implemented stringent community isolation measures, the promotion of preventive behaviours, as well as a growing number of immune people. For the reduced case fatality rate, possible contributing factors include a smaller pool of vulnerable people as well as boosted healthcare capacities from reallocation and optimisation of resources.",

As a consequence, we believe data on all cause mortality should be considered along with traditionally reported measures as an important metric to evaluate and compare the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic within and between settings. Although all cause mortality can only be interpreted as an approximation of the health status of the population under study, it is more often systematically collected under high quality standards, relies on universally accepted classification, and is not influenced by testing strategies or shortages of tests. 25 Furthermore, this metric captures indirect deaths, such as those related to a healthcare system under crisis, yielding a more complete picture of the pandemic\u2019s effects on population health. As we have outlined, this metric has several advantages and overcomes major drawbacks of other statistics for quantifying the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.",
