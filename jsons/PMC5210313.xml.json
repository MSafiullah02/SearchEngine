A chest radiograph repeated the following day showed the presence of perihilar haziness and increased pulmonary vascular markings (Fig. 1b). The patient\u2019s platelet counts dropped further to 17 \u00d7 109/L but there was no sign of spontaneous bleeding. He also went through a few hypotensive episodes where the BP dropped to 85/50 mmHg and mean arterial pressure down to 60 mmHg. Vasopressor had to be initiated to maintain a mean arterial pressure of above 65 mmHg. Meanwhile, he suffered acute kidney injury with a urine output of 5\u201310 mL/h, requiring haemodialysis. Although it was the seventh day of illness (second day from admission), the patient had a spiking temperature of 38.7 \u00b0C. The fever was preceded by severe shivering which lasted for nearly an hour. This shivering led clinicians to perform a blood film for malaria parasite (BFMP). The result showed the presence of the malaria parasite resembling Plasmodium knowlesi with parasitaemia of 520,000/\u00b5L of blood. Intravenous artesunate 2.4 mg/kg daily and doxycycline 100 mg twice a day were started. Subsequently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test confirmed the parasite to be P. knowlesi. Soon after starting anti-malarial treatment, the malaria parasite count dropped to 460,000/\u03bcL after 24 h and 320/\u03bcL after 48 h, respectively.

Surprisingly, in a study conducted in Thailand in 2006 by Singhsilarak et al. involving 194 patients with malaria, no co-infection with dengue was found [37]. To date, there has been only one case reported in Thailand on dual dengue-malaria infection involving P. falciparum-DENV [38]. With this current incidence occurring near the Malaysia\u2013Thailand border, awareness among doctors in this region is crucial with regard to the possibility of co-infection. Both diseases are endemic in Southeast Asia, especially in areas near to jungle that is undergoing urbanization. As for Malaysia, both diseases may overlap in Sarawak and Sabah [39], Pahang and Kelantan [40].",

In view of the diagnostic difficulty and the high mortality risk, the Malaysian Malaria Management Guidelines recommend that all blood film results with parasites resembling P. malariae should be reported as P. knowlesi/P. malariae and patients should be treated as P. knowlesi infection [45].",

The eradication of this parasitic disease is expected to be difficult and not achievable in the near future. The incidence of co-infection should be taken seriously. Reported cases of concurrent infection in Southeast Asia are far too few compared to the dengue-malaria co-infection rate, from 1 to 33%: in French Guiana (1%) [26], Kenya (5.7%) [33], India (10.25%) [8], and Pakistan (23.21\u201333%) [9, 10] in local studies. The actual number of incidences are probably underestimated as such areas are known to be highly endemic for both malaria and dengue, especially around the forest area of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, East Timor, Papua, Sabah, and Sarawak.",

These two diseases share similar major symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Differentiating them is difficult on clinical grounds alone. One of the clinical signs that may suggest malaria rather than dengue in this context will be splenomegaly [48]. However, this patient had no splenomegaly and absence of splenomegaly does not rule out malaria. With the emergence of malaria-dengue co-infections, even with laboratory investigations, the risk of overlooking malaria is still high in dengue outbreak areas and vice versa. This is because they both share similar laboratory findings with dengue, such as thrombocytopaenia. In Malaysia, the confirmation tests for dengue (NS1 antigen and dengue IgM) are rapid and easily available. A positive confirmatory dengue test often misleads practitioners to rule out the possibilities of other diseases without actually screening against it [42, 49, 50].",

However, there are some signs for clinicians to suspect the presence of concomitant infection with dengue. Firstly, in most cases of dengue, the fever spikes by day 5 of illness. Fever may be prolonged in patients who have co-existing infections [52]. Secondly, patients with dengue are more likely to have a temperature under 39 \u00b0C [48]. Thirdly, they are more likely to be associated with leucopenia [48], haemo concentration [8] and atypical lymphocytosis [34, 35]. In this patient, the temperature was 40 \u00b0C on day 6 of illness, there was no haemoconcentration and no leucopenia. Additionally, he had anuria, worsening metabolic acidosis and hyperlactatemia, which was resistant to aggressive fluid resuscitation. These are strong indications to further investigate co-existing infections. In fact, a leptospirosis test was taken on admission with prophylactic treatment for leptospirosis. Unfortunately, BFMP was not done upon admission.",

If left untreated, this condition can rapidly turn fatal as P. knowlesi has a 24-h replication cycle [53] (48 h for P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. ovale; 72 h for P. malariae [54]) which causes a drastic rise in parasitaemia leading to multiple organ failure. Additionally, treatment of these two illnesses differs. Most dengue cases can be treated with adequate supportive management, i.e., fluid replacement and other measures. Supportive management itself may reduce the mortality rate from more than 20% to less than 1% in severe dengue cases [55]. To treat malaria, specific anti-malarial medication has to be used or the infection may rapidly become fatal [56, 57]. In a case reported in East Timor, a girl who falsely tested negative for malaria with a rapid diagnostic kit died within 7 h of admission because of delayed treatment [12]. There were several mortalities in Malaysia where parenteral artesunate was delayed because P. knowlesi was wrongly reported as P. malariae, which has a relatively benign clinical course [57]. Awareness and a high index of suspicion of the possibility of dengue-malaria co-infection can be life-saving and any suspicion of such case must be carefully excluded.",
