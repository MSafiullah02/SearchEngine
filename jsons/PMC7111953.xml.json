            "text": "The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against an invading viral pathogen and the outcome of an infection is dependent on the ability of host cells to recognize the invading pathogen and activate appropriate signaling pathways. Cells are equipped with a group of proteins known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon stimulation by pathogens, multiple signaling pathways are activated, leading to the induction of a number of latent transcription factors and the establishment of an anti-viral state (Sen, 2001). In cells infected with RNA and DNA viruses, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is produced as a replication intermediate and recognized as PAMPs by three major types of RNA sensors, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, and retinoid acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (Mda5), leading to the induction of type 1 interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Garcia et al., 2007, Takeuchi and Akira, 2009). Cytokines produced during a viral infection are potent immunomodulatory molecules that act as mediators of inflammation and the immune response. They are key regulators in governing host defense against pathogens. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-6, and IL-8 are produced early in the infection, triggering the production of Th1 cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 involved in cellular immune responses. In this report, the cellular mechanisms exploited by coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to regulate the induction of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, at the transcriptional level were studied.",

Of the three MAPK pathways described in mammalian cells, the ERK pathway, the JNK pathway, and the p38 MAPK pathway, the ERK pathway is activated by mitogenic and proliferative stimuli, whereas the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways are activated by environmental stresses. So far, four p38 isoforms, p38\u03b1, p38\u03b2, p38\u03b3 and p38\u03b4, have been identified (Nebreda and Porras, 2000). Among them, p38\u03b1 is the most widely expressed and best characterized isoform. Evidence available suggests that p38 MAPK activates a specific set of transcription factors, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. For example, embryonic stem cells derived from p38\u03b1 MAPK-null mice showed a reduced IL-6 production in response to chemical stress (Allen et al., 2000).",

DUSPs constitute a structurally distinct family of 11 proteins, with DUSP1 being the archetype of the family (Lang et al., 2006). In addition to heat shock and oxidative stress, DUSP1 has been shown to be up-regulated by other pro-inflammatory stress stimuli, such as ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Abraham and Clark, 2006, Liu et al., 2007). Prolonged activation of p38 MAPK in DUSP1-deficient macrophages (Chattopadhyay et al., 2006, Zhao et al., 2005) indicates that p38 MAPK is the target of DUSP1 (Franklin and Kraft, 1997). In addition, the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were substantially increased in DUSP1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages upon LPS stimulation (Chi et al., 2006, Hammer et al., 2006, Salojin et al., 2006, Zhao et al., 2006). Up-regulation of DUSP1 by virus infection was also reported (Abraham and Clark, 2006), indicating a clear physiological regulatory role of DUSP1 in innate immunity.",

            "text": "IBV is the prototype virus of group 3 coronaviruses in the family of coronaviridae (Liu et al., 1997). It is an enveloped RNA virus with a 27.6 kb single stranded RNA genome packed with the nucleocapsid protein (Liu et al., 1991, Liu and Inglis, 1991). IBV infection of chickens causes an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease (Fang et al., 2007, Fang et al., 2005, Shen et al., 2004). It initially infects the upper respiratory tract, where it is restricted to the ciliated and mucus-secreting cells (Raj and Jones, 1997). High virus titers were detected in the nose, trachea, lung, and airsacs (Ambali and Jones, 1990, Hofstad and Yoder, 1966). Following infection of chickens by IBV, interferon was detected in trachea and lung (Otsuki et al., 1987). Chicken type 1 interferon reduced replication of IBV in chicken tracheal organ culture and kidney cell culture (Pei et al., 2001). Intravenous or oral application of type I interferon delayed the onset of disease in chickens and its severity. In this study, analysis of the infected cells by Affymetrix microarray, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot revealed the induction of IRF1, DUSP1, IL-6 and IL-8 at the transcriptional level. Activation of p38 MAPK was found in cells infected with IBV. Furthermore, this study showed that p38 activity was responsible for the induction of the two pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. The p38 MAPK activity was regulated by IBV-induced up-regulation of DUSP1, resulting in the suppression of excessive induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

Vero cells were infected with IBV at an MOI of approximately 1 and harvested at 0, 8, 16, and 24 h post-infection. Total RNAs were extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis with DIG-labeled DNA probes for IL-6, IL-8, and IRF1, respectively. IBV RNAs were also detected to indicate the efficiency of viral infection, and GAPDH as a loading control for normalization. As shown in Fig. 1A, IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1 mRNAs were gradually increased after 8 h post-infection, and peaked at 24 h post-infection. Quantification of the corresponding bands by densitometry showed that IL-6 mRNA was induced 17-fold at 8 h post-infection and continued to increase to 109-fold at 24 h post-infection, IL-8 mRNA was induced 3-fold at 8 h post-infection and continued to increase to 57-fold at 24 h post-infection, and IRF1 was induced 2-fold at 8 h post-infection and continued to increase to 8-fold at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1A). It was noted that the folds of IL-6 and IL-8 induction obtained by this approach were much higher than those obtained by Affymetrix and real-time RT-PCR assays. Nevertheless, these results clearly demonstrate that IL-6, IL-8, and IRF1 are induced at the mRNA level in Vero cells infected with IBV.",

Vero, H1299 and Huh7 cells were individually infected with IBV and harvested at 0, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h post-infection, respectively. Mock-infected cells harvested at 24 h post-infection were used as negative controls for each cell line. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1 showed that all three factors were induced with various efficiencies at the transcriptional level in all the three cell lines. Quantification of the PCR bands showed that IL-6 was induced 4- to 5-fold, IL-8 was induced 2- to 12-fold, and IRF1 was induced 4- to 10-fold over the time-course in IBV-infected H1299 cells (Fig. 2\n). In IBV-infected Huh7 cells, IL-6 was induced 2- to 7-fold, IL-8 was induced 11- to 13-fold, and IRF1 was induced 3- to 5-fold (Fig. 2). In IBV-infected Vero cells, IL-6 was induced 2- to 6-fold, IL-8 was induced 3- to 7-fold, and IRF1 was induced 5- to 31-fold (Fig. 2). It was noted that minor induction of these cytokines was also observed in mock-treated cells which might be due to the serum starvation or cell overgrowth (Fig. 2). After normalization, the relative induction folds of IL-6 and IL-8 in IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 h post-infection determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR were roughly comparable to those obtained by Affymetrix and real-time RT-PCR assays. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was therefore used to quantify the induction folds of these factors in most experiments described in the subsequent sections. IBV gRNA(+) was detected for indication of efficient viral replication, showing gradually increased accumulation of the viral gRNA(+) over time (Fig. 2). These observations further confirm that IBV infection of cultured cells from different origins induces the transcription of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1.",

The effect of IBV infection on the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway was examined. Vero and H1299 cells infected with live (IBV) or UV-inactivated IBV (UV-IBV) were harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 h post-infection, respectively. UV-IBV was included in the experiment to check whether virus entry was sufficient to activate this pathway. The p-p38 MAPK was detected by Western blot with anti-p-p38 antibody and total p38 MAPK was detected by p38 MAPK antibody in the same membrane after stripping off p-p38 antibody. Result showed that p-p38 MAPK was increased from 12 h to 24 h post-infection and the total p38 MAPK expression was relatively over the time-course (Fig. 3A). After normalization of p-p38 MAPK to p38 MAPK, a 2.2- to 2.7-fold increase of p-p38 MAPK was observed from 12 to 20 h post-infection in IBV-infected Vero cells; a 2.1- to 2.5-fold induction of p-p38 was detected from 12 to 20 h post-infection in IBV-infected H1299 cells; and a 3- to 4-fold induction of p-p38 was also detected at 16 and 20 h post-infection in IBV-infected Huh7 cells (Fig. 3A). However, in cells infected with UV-IBV, the p-p38 MAPK level was relatively constant over the time-course (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the virus entry step is not sufficient to activate this pathway. The same membranes were stripped and re-probed with IBV M or N protein antibodies, showed the efficient virus replication in IBV-infected cells. \u03b2-tubulin was probed as an internal loading control (Fig. 3A). These results demonstrate that p38 MAPK was activated in IBV-infected cells and active virus replication is required for this activation. As phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was observed in all three cell lines, it also suggests that activation of the p38 MAPK pathway upon IBV infection is not restricted to a specific cell type.",

SB203580 inhibits the p38 MAPK activity by blocking its catalytic function but not phosphorylation, resulting in the suppression of the downstream substrate activation in the p38 MAPK pathway (Kumar et al., 1999). H1299 cells were either treated with 50 \u03bcM of SB203580 or mock-treated with DMSO alone for 1 h prior to IBV infection and throughout the time-course. At different time points post-infection, cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot with antibodies against p-p38, p38, IBV N protein and actin. As shown in Fig. 4A, similar amounts of IBV N protein were detected in SB203580- and DMSO-treated cells at each time point. Elevated levels of p-p38 MAPK were observed in both SB203580- and DMSO-treated samples from 8 h post-infection until 16 h post-infection, although higher levels of p-p38 MAPK were observed in SB203580-treated cells at 4, 8, 12 and 16 h post-infection (Fig. 4A). At 20 h post-infection, the level of p-p38 MAPK was slightly reduced in SB203580-treated cells (Fig. 4A). The increased detection of p-p38 MAPK in cells treated with SB203580 was also observed in IBV-infected Vero cells at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 4B), and was reported in other studies (Ciuffini et al., 2008). Similar levels of IBV M protein were detected in SB203580- and DMSO-treated cells at 8 h and 20 h post-infection (Fig. 4B).",

Negative control siRNA was transfected into another set of cells as a control. The p38 MAPK knockdown efficiency was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, showing an almost 100% knockdown efficiency at the mRNA level and 18\u201362% knockdown efficiencies at the protein level at different time points (Fig. 5A).

However, in p38-knockdown cells, the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 was progressively suppressed from 12 to 15 h post-infection, and reduced to a minimal level at 18 h post-infection (Fig. 5A), confirming that p38 MAPK pathway is important for IL-6 and IL-8 induction. Similar levels of viral RNA were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in both p38-knockdown and control cells (Fig. 5A). However, at the protein level, less IBV S protein was detected in the knockdown cells infected with IBV at 12 h post-infection, compared to that in the control cells (Fig. 5A).

Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines plays an important role in the pathogenesis of virus infection, and may be regulated by the p38 MAPK and DUSP1 feedback loop. The p38 MAPK is involved in numerous biological processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cytokine production. On the other hand, DUSP1 negatively regulates p38 MAPK phosphorylation and forms a feedback loop. In this study, we show that levels of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, were greatly elevated during IBV infection of cultured cells. This induction may be resulted from activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Meanwhile, DUSP1 was also stimulated to regulate the p38 MAPK activity in the late stage of viral infection. As activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and induction of IL-6 and IL-8 may have multiple pathogenic effects on the whole host as well as on individual infected cells, regulation of the p38 MAPK and DUSP1 feedback loop by IBV may modulate the pathogenesis of the virus. Further studies using avian cells, chicken embryos and young chicks would reveal more information on the functional roles of this regulatory loop in IBV\u2013host interactions, viral replication and pathogenesis.",

For example, MHV, a prototype coronavirus in group II, was able to activate the p38 MAPK pathway in the infected cells (Banerjee et al., 2002). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, were significantly induced by infection of primary mouse astrocytes and microglia with MHV strains JHM and A59 (Yu and Zhang, 2006). It was also observed that phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was greatly elevated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells at 18 h post-infection (Mizutani et al., 2004). In this study, treatment of cells either with the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB203580, or with a small interfering RNA targeting p38 MAPK almost abolished the IBV-medicated induction of IL-6 and IL-8. It was previously suggested that in MHV-infected cells, phosphorylation of eIF4E promoted by p38 MAPK may contribute to the induction of IL-6 (Banerjee et al., 2002). However, our preliminary data did not show an increase in the phosphorylation of eIF4E in IBV-infected cells (data not shown). Based on the observation that IL-6 induction was detected at the transcriptional level in IBV-infected cells, it is unlikely that eIF4E phosphorylation is a major contributing factor in IL-6 induction by IBV infection.",

It is a protein phosphatase that regulates the activities of p38 MAPK and JNK, and, to a less extent, the ERK1/2 MAPK activity. It functions as a negative regulator to suppress the production of excessive cytokines and inflammatory responses (Turpeinen et al.). In DUSP1-deficient mice, increased levels of IL-6 and other cytokines were detected (Hammer et al., 2006). Up-regulation of DUSP1 was detected in cells in response to pro-inflammatory stress stimuli, such as UV irradiation and treatment of cells with pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 (Lasa et al., 2002, Li et al., 2001, Toh et al., 2004). Up-regulation of DUSP1 upon infections by viruses was also reported (Abraham and Clark, 2006). One example is the nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which could up-regulate DUSP1 (Tachado et al., 2005). In this study, either siRNA-mediated knockdown of DUSP1 or inhibition of the DUSP1 activity by a specific inhibitor enhances and prolongs the p38 MAPK activation and the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 in IBV-infected cells. These observations imply that up-regulation of DUSP1 by IBV may be a viral strategy to prevent drastic activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and limit pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. The mechanisms that control the IBV-mediated up-regulation of DUSP1 await elucidation. One possibility is that some of the IBV proteins may be able to trigger its activation. Alternatively, the virus may up-regulate DUSP1 indirectly by activation of either IL-1 or TNF\u03b1, as an increase in IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 production in IBV-infected cells was also observed (unpublished observations). More systematic studies are underway to address these issues further.",

It is well known that this cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) and inhibits translation (Dar et al., 2005, Dey et al., 2005). A recent study reported that PKR-dependent activation of MAPK is induced in vaccinia virus-infected cells, but is antagonized by viral E3L protein (Zhang et al., 2009). In addition, PKR is also involved in other signaling pathways, including p53, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) (Kumar et al., 1997, Lemaire et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Similar to that in cells infected with other RNA viruses, dsRNA is generated as a replication intermediate in coronavirus-infected cells during the replication and transcription of the genomic and subgenomic RNA by a discontinuous transcription mechanism (Sawicki et al., 2007, Zuniga et al., 2004). PKR may act as a major sensor of cytosolic dsRNA (Sadler and Williams, 2007, Yang et al., 1995), and plays a role in transduction of pro-inflammatory signals by mediating the activation of dsRNA-dependent NF\u03baB (Zamanian-Daryoush et al., 2000). However, it remains unclear whether the PKR kinase activity is directly required for signal transduction or PKR may simply function as a structural protein via interaction with other kinases and adaptor proteins. For instance, PKR was suggested to interact with TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 as a scaffold protein to mediate TLR3-dependent NF-\u03baB and MAPK activation (Jiang et al., 2003). PKR was also linked to TRAF2 and TRAF5 (Gil et al., 2004). A more recent study in human keratinocytes proposed a central role for PKR in dsRNA-mediated type I IFN responses involving both TLR3 and RIG-I pathways (Kalali et al., 2008). Alternatively, PKR was shown to activate the p38 MAPK pathway in response to dsRNA by phosphorylation of the upstream kinase MKK6 (Silva et al., 2004). It would be interesting to investigate if PKR is actively involved in IBV-induced p38 MAPK activation and IL-6/IL-8 induction. As PKR phosphorylation was shown to be severely inhibited in IBV-infected cells at later stages of the replication cycles (73), it may suggest that the kinase activity of PKR may be not critically required for its involvement in the induction of IL-6 and IL-8.",
