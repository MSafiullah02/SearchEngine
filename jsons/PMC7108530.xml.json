Hosts in turn have developed innate cellular defenses to block infection and replication of these viruses. It has been well established that the introduction of a virus into a host cell alters the host's proteome resulting in novel protein interactions. The novel interactions may not only occur between integral host components, but may also involve viral proteins. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) would therefore enable the utilization of these mechanisms for the discovery of antiviral drugs and the identification of virally altered host proteins (Zheng et al., 2011; Kshirsagar et al., 2013; Mancone et al., 2013).",

For the purposes of this review, we consider host proteins that interact with one another and with viral proteins forming distinct complexes as an interactome.

This method relies on the interaction between a \u2018bait\u2019 fusion protein and a \u2018prey\u2019 fusion protein to activate reporter genes or selectable markers. The advantages to this system are that it is economical and can be used to process large sample sizes (Drewes & Bouwmeester, 2003; White & Howley, 2013). For example, a pooled library screen approach can be used where a library of known \u2018prey\u2019 clones are combined and tested as pools against \u2018bait\u2019 strains. An example of determining PPI by the Y2H system was demonstrated by the influenza virus NS1 protein and human Staufen proteins in vivo (Falc\u00f3n et al., 1999; Cho et al., 2013), where coupling genome wide expression profiling with the Y2H system suggested a large number of host\u2013viral protein interactions (Shapira et al., 2009; Tafforeau et al., 2011). Additionally, this system was used to identify: nine putative host cell proteins interacting with NSm of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV); Vaccinia virus interactions with a variety of proteins (McCraith et al., 2000); Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u2010CoronaVirus (SARS\u2010CoV) proteins self\u2010interacting and/or interacting with other viral proteins to form multimeric complexes (Von Brunn et al., 2007); and numerous cellular proteins binding to Dengue virus (DENV) proteins (Khadka et al., 2011). Unfortunately this procedure is also limited in that interactions between more than two proteins cannot be detected (Drewes & Bouwmeester, 2003; White & Howley, 2013) and the PPIs are observed outside of their natural context and will always require independent validation in relevant model systems.",

            "text": "The analysis of PPIs traditionally involves binding systems, where the protein of interest is tagged for recovery in methods such as co\u2010immunoprecipitations (co\u2010IP Miernyk & Thelen, 2008; Noisakran et al., 2008). Co\u2010IPs rely on the idea that a fairly strong interaction between two proteins is stable under stringent elution conditions (such as high salt). When one partner of such an interaction is precipitated, the interacting protein is also precipitated and can be detected by antibody\u2010based methods. Co\u2010IP usually uses a sepharose\u2010protein A column. Briefly, an antibody specific to the protein of interest is incubated with prepared protein samples to form an antibody\u2010protein complex, which is then analyzed by SDS\u2010PAGE and Western blotting, or further processed for more modern approaches including Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization \u2013 Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI\u2010TOF MS) Drewes & Bouwmeester, 2003; Miernyk & Thelen, 2008; Zheng et al., 2011). As examples, the use of co\u2010IP has allowed for the identification of host\u2013viral PPIs such as: DENV nonstructural protein 1 and human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2(Noisakran et al., 2008); the methyltransferase domain of West Nile Virus NS5 protein and mammalian cGMP\u2010dependent protein kinase, protein kinase G (Keating et al., 2013); and Vaccinia virus p37 with the host Rab9 and tail interacting protein of 47 kDa (TIP47) Chen et al., 2009). Additional examples of co\u2010IP studies include the Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus, nonstructural protein 2 with the host's major ribosomal phosphoprotein RpS6(Montgomery et al., 2006) and Ebola virus VP35 protein with the host inhibitor of \u03baB kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) and TANK\u2010binding kinase 1 (TBK\u20101) (Prins et al., 2009). While valuable information has been determined through co\u2010IP studies, the major drawbacks to this technique are that it may not be an accurate representation of an in vivo scenario, and weak or transient PPIs may be overlooked (Hsu & Spindler, 2012).",

            "text": "Additional methods are emerging to analyze PPIs that utilize a new generation of aptamers that contain chemically modified nucleotides. Aptamers are short single\u2010stranded oligonucleotides that bind with high affinity and specificity to proteins, peptides, and small molecules (Gold, 1995; Brody & Gold, 2000). One method uses Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) to select aptamers from libraries of randomized sequences (Ellington & Szostak, 1990; Gold, 1995). Although this technology has high potential for high\u2010throughput biomarker identification, there have been some difficulties creating high affinity aptamers for some protein targets (Gold, 1995). In addressing this problem, a new form of aptamers has been developed, called Slow Off\u2010rate Modified Adapters (SOMAmers). The basis for SOMAmers is that the addition of functional groups can give aptamers protein\u2010like properties that enable a wider variety of high affinity aptamers (Gold et al., 2010). The aptamer\u2010based technology wave has advantages, but requires further characterization, validation and standardization with standards such as affinity capture\u2010MS (Gold et al., 2010).",

More recently, large\u2010scale \u2018precision proteomics\u2019 based on MS and microarrays have enabled the system\u2010wide characterization of host\u2010based events at the levels of post\u2010translational modifications, PPIs and changes in protein expression. This advancement delivers accurate and unbiased quantitative information regarding protein modifications in response to any perturbation.

Additional applications of FPMA involved profiling protein tyrosine phosphorylation and characterizing changes in post\u2010translational modifications, such as acetylation and ubiquitination in mammalian cells (Ivanov et al., 2004). Other studies have developed a proteomic profile of cancer progression in oral cavity cancer tissue samples where a combination of FPMA was employed with Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) (Knezevic et al., 2001). LCM enables researchers to isolate cells of interest from heterogeneous tissue (with multiple kinds of cells) and arrive at a homogeneous cell population without contamination from surrounding nonrelevant cells (Espina et al., 2006). For additional technical information on LCM, the reader is directed to Espina et al. (2006).

Performing serial dilutions of the samples is often necessary to dilute protein concentrations to alleviate high background issues (Gulmann et al., 2006).

RPMA is a newer iteration of traditional FPMA technology developed in 2001 for the cancer field by Drs. Lance Liotta and Emanuel Petricoin III, where cell populations from samples taken from cancer tissue were subjected to LCM and used to analyze the state of pro\u2010survival checkpoints and growth regulation proteins (Wulfkuhle et al., 2004; Paweletz et al. 2001). Since this publication, RPMA technology has been adopted by many research groups and applied not only to LCM tissue, but also to heterogenous tissue samples, cell culture lysates (Nishizuka et al., 2003), and serum/plasma samples (Janzi et al., 2005; Mueller et al., 2010), ovarian effusions (Davidson et al., 2006), vitreous (Davuluri et al., 2009), fine needle aspirates (Rapkiewicz et al., 2007), and peptides (MacBeath & Schreiber, 2000). Moreover, the use of RPMA has not been limited to pre\u2010clinical research studies, but has been a critical component of several clinical trials [for review see Mueller et al. (2010)], cancers (VanMeter et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2010; Einspahr et al., 2012), cellular pathway characterizations, bacterial infection mechanisms (Popova et al., 2009), immunological disorders and viral\u2013host interactions (Wilson et al., 2010; Einspahr et al., 2012; Aguilar\u2010Mahecha et al., 2009; Narayanan et al., 2012; Baer et al., 2012; Austin et al., 2012; Popova et al., 2010).

For this reason, the combination of LCM technology with RPMA creates a powerful analytical tool based on its increased sensitivity, reduced sample volume/concentration input requirements and combination of hundreds to thousands of samples on a single array. Moreover, because the RPMA is not a two\u2010site sandwich\u2010type antibody array and requires only one well\u2010performing primary antibody for detection, the number of analytes that can be measured is much greater than what could be performed on a forward\u2010phase array.

The source of these analytes could be in vitro samples generated from cultured cells or in vivo samples generated from animal tissue or clinical samples. With a spot size of only tens to a few hundred microns in diameter, the RPMA platform allows for thousands of samples to fit on one slide and hundreds of slides can be analyzed in every array run giving this approach a high throughput flavor. Each array is then probed with a single primary antibody, in principle similar to other immunoassays.",

In this study, Popova et al. used RPMA to identify phospho\u2010signaling protein pathways modulated in cultured human cells at very early (of the order of a few minutes) to late time points after RVFV infection. Human cells were infected with the wildtype strain of RVFV, ZH\u2010501 and cells were lysed at various time points. For the RPMA procedure, c. 30 nL of each sample (equivalent to the amount of material from 40 lysed cells) was arrayed on nitrocellulose slides. An advantage of the array layout is that each sample is printed in a 4\u20138 point dilution series which ensures that the quantification of positive signals can be performed in the linear range. Each slide was then probed with one of 60 different antibodies specific against phosphorylated or total forms of signaling proteins. The antibodies were selected to monitor the molecular networks involved in host responses most likely affected by virus exposure such as apoptotic and cell survival pathways. To validate the RPMA data, the levels of multiple selected proteins were analyzed by Western blots using antibodies against phosphorylated and total forms of proteins; both procedures were in agreement with each other. This demonstrated that while RPMA has enormous technical utility independently, it can also function in a synergistic capacity with traditional methods.",

Some software packages, such as microvigene, include several features to facilitate quantification of array data: automated spot\u2010boundary detection with image contrast enhancement, dust/scratch removal, outlier flagging, regional background correction and total protein, negative controls and internal reference standard normalization options (Gulmann et al., 2006). Data normalization algorithms range from calibration curve normalization (Sevecka & MacBeath, 2006), spiked\u2010in internal standard normalization (Korf et al., 2008), Robust\u2010Linear\u2010Model normalization (Sboner et al., 2009), to normalization of respective sample total protein. In the example of Popova et al.

The outcome of each RPMA run is a virtual treasure trove of information on multiple signaling events analyzed as a single snapshot in time. Each one of those altered signal events will form a basis of an individual hypothesis. If this involved specific viral strains or individual viral proteins, for example, we can go to great lengths in deciphering functional consequences of PPIs. This was exemplified by a RPMA study conducted by Popova et al. (2012) that revealed phosphorylation and activation of the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling cascade. Narayanan et al. (2012) demonstrated in a follow up study that phosphorylation of p65 (serine 536) involved phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 through the classical NF\u03baB cascade and that RVFV utilized the host NF\u2010\u03baB signaling cascade to establish a robust infection. In addition, this group demonstrated that inhibition of the NF\u2010\u03baB cascade was able to inhibit viral replication (Narayanan et al., 2012). The more important outcome of that study was that the viral protein NSs may have an influence on the activation status of the cascade. The same RPMA study also revealed that the tumor suppressor protein, p53 was phosphorylated in the event of ZH501 infection (Austin et al., 2012). A study by Austin et al. (2012) expanded on this data to show that in RVFV infections, p53 was activated, phosphorylated and localized in the nucleus following transient interaction with the RVFV virulence factor NSs. Further characterization of p53 phosphorylation prompted investigation into the DNA damage signaling pathway during RVFV infection. Baer et al. (2012) demonstrated that RVFV infection induced an NSs\u2010dependent DNA damage signaling response and concurrent S\u2010phase arrest, providing evidence for a novel function of NSs that was shown to directly impact viral replication. Collectively, modifications in phospho\u2010protein signaling in RVFV examined by a single RPMA study resulted in the elucidation of numerous cellular mechanisms that played important roles during viral infection and that were subsequently exploited in targeting viral replication. The results drawn from these studies illustrate how the high throughput identification of PPIs between the host and the virus can lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets during viral infection (Baer et al., 2012).",

New techniques utilizing traditional and novel next\u2010generation targeted proteomics have started to shift the traditional paradigm from using discovery\u2010based identification to targeted quantification, such as in the utilization of triple quadruple mass spectrometers (QQQ; Boja & Rodriguez, 2012; Shi et al., 2012; Fung et al., 2013). With a discovery\u2010based strategy, the goal is usually to identify as many proteins as possible, while the goal of a targeted proteomics is to monitor a select few proteins of interest with high sensitivity, reproducibility and quantitative accuracy. In the traditional discovery\u2010based approach peptide ions are automatically selected in the mass spectrometer for fragmentation on the basis of their signal intensities, generating rich but complex tandem mass spectra for each peptide sequence, requiring careful analysis and complex bioinformatics. In contrast when using a targeted workflow, the QQQ mass spectrometer can be programmed to detect specific peptide ions derived from proteins of interest, and can select specific \u2018precursor\u2019 ions (on the basis of their m/z ratio) for fragmentation. In the second mass filter, target ions are selected and guided to the detector for quantification, resulting in a trace of signal intensity vs. retention time for each precursor ion\u2013product ion pair. This process is called selected reaction monitoring (SRM) or multiple reaction monitoring (MRM; Lange et al., 2008). While this up\u2010front approach is much more labor intensive to develop than a traditional discovery\u2010based pipeline, once a reliable assay is generated for a specific protein, analysis of the MS data is relatively straightforward and uncomplicated in comparison. While SRM is the most mature MS\u2010based technology for targeted proteome analysis, new methodologies that obviate the need for laborious SRM assay optimization are currently being developed. One example of several novel methodologies is SWATH; complex mass spectra generated by data\u2010independent acquisition (in which peptides are selected for fragmentation without regard to signal intensity) are queried for the presence of specific peptides using libraries of qualified peptide fragment spectra (Gillet et al., 2012).",
