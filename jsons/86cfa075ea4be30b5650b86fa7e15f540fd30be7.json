            "text": "Kary Mullis' 1983 invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) marked the starting point of modern molecular diagnostics. Today, the PCR-based detection of nucleic acids is routinely used to diagnose a plethora of infectious diseases, to genetically test for cancer, and to monitor ongoing treatments (Ieven 2007) . A wide range of commercially available specialized kits enable easy-toperform protocols, but regarding the entire workflow from sample to result, the complex manual handling led to calls for more convenient or automated solutions. As a result, sequential steps previously executed manually in separate devices have gradually been combined within a single device. By now, fully integrated, as well as miniaturized solutions are available in the form of \"lab-on-a-chip\" (LoC) systems, the most elaborate of which are capable of processing diagnostic tests from sample to result. A major driver in their development is the reduction in the costs per analysis and per single test result afforded by them. Critical factors for the marketability of such devices, however, also M. Ritzi-Lehnert (*) : J. Clau\u00dfen : E. Schaeffer : J. O. Wiborg : I. Wick : K. S. Drese include a high significance and reliability of the results as well as sensitivities and specificities that satisfy stringent clinical requirements. At this stage, many microfluidics-based concepts and technologies fail to meet these demands (e.g. Blow 2007 , Chen et al. 2007 , Dobson et al. 2007 , Zhang and Xing 2007 , Weigl et al. 2008 , Sauer-Budge et al. 2009 , Huckle 2006 , Becker 2009 , Kaigala et al. 2010 , Lounsbury et al. 2010 , Fujimoto et al. 2010 .",

Here, we present a lab-on-a-chip system that integrates all processing steps for detecting respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal samples. The device features, among other things, a combined lysis and nucleic acid binding step, a novel magnetic separation principle, \"on-chip\" nested multiplex amplification, and internal processing and amplification controls. Current cost-per-analysis (COG) estimates are in the $10-$15 range. The present system can easily be adapted to different pathogens and may thus offer a route to opening new markets for in-vitro diagnostics.",

Several fluids have to be moved, merged, metered, mixed and heated in a controlled manner. To prevent cross-contamination during all steps T-junctions and overlapping structures were excluded on the chip. To ensure precise pumping and positioning of the fluids, the gas volume in the system has to be minimized as its compressibility may cause uncontrollable fluid movements. Homogeneous mixing and fast heat distribution within the reaction chambers has to be guaranteed. Since magnetic stirring known from standard laboratory equipment is a very effective mixing method, magnetic stir bars are integrated into the chip at several positions. Inside the lysis chamber mixing is done using a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar. Within the SPE chamber, the PCR chambers, and the hybridization chamber a piece of foilmagnet is used, respectively.",

These multiway turning valves permit a chip design without T-junctions and overlapping structures. In addition, these valves not only allow for different channel connections but also for the integration of metering structures. One metering structure is needed to separate an aliquot of the first RT-PCR for processing in the second amplification step and a second metering structure separates an aliquot of the second PCR for the following hybridization step. To avoid moving tiny reagent volumes, we decided to store all enzymes and PCR reagents in freezedried form on the chip while all buffers needed in larger volumes are stored in liquid form in a reagent cartridge allowing 24 analyses. The buffers are moved into the chip using syringe pumps since those allow pulsation-free pumping. Contamination is prevented by collecting liquid waste in special waste chambers on the chip.",

Four resistive heating elements, each contained in one bracket, are symmetrically fixed on turnable discs. One disc is located above and one below the disposable chip. The temperatures of the corresponding heating brackets can be pairwisely set. Three pairs of these can be actively heated, while one corresponding pair of heating brackets serves as a passive cooling element having room temperature. An additional stepper motor moves two eccentric discs to travel the heating brackets towards and backwards the disposable processing chip. These eccentric discs are placed above the upper and below the lower heating elements. By bringing the heating elements directly in contact with the chip, the heat transfer is facilitated. After incubation for a given time (seconds), the heating elements are locked off, and the carrousel moves the turnable discs with the heating brackets to the next position. The next cycling step is accomplished by moving the corresponding pair of brackets towards the chip again. In order to increase the rate of cooling from e.g. 95\u00b0C to 52\u00b0C, the software programme moves for heat dissipation the non-heated pair of brackets towards the chip first, before the heating brackets preset to 52\u00b0C are attached to the cartridge to reach the final target temperature. Foil-magnet pieces within the PCR-chambers are moved by electromagnetic coils located at the lower part of the corresponding pair of heating brackets, supplying an alternating current. This enables a fast homogeneous heat transfer within the reaction mixture. The electromagnets run at AC mode with 50 Hz frequency. Using electromagnetic coils a tumbling action of the central magnets is generated, whereas the magnetic mini-stirrer induces a forced convection (Kim et al. 2009 ).",

The RNA yield was slightly lower (81%) and the DNA yield slightly higher (131%) for the LoC system compared to the EZ1 prepared RNA and DNA yields ( Fig. 6 top left) . These small differences might result from the assay specific performance based on the sample preparation method, but overall both preparation approaches revealed similar yields in RNA and DNA.",

Surprisingly, blocking reagents sustain the efficiency of the RT-PCR reaction but were unfavourable in the second PCR reaction (Fig. 6 bottom left) . The efficiency of the nested RT-PCR was lower on-chip than in the conventional setup without the prior addition of blocking reagents (on-chip V1). Upon adding such blocking reagents in both PCR reactions (on-chip V2) it was further decreased.

Comparison of time consumption for 30 cycles using a conventional lab cycler system (MJ Research) and the heating carrousel (\"Fumu PCR\") where times needed for the reaction itself, the temperature ramping and the movement of the clamps are indicated with different colours reduced using the dried reagents to about 60% of the results obtained with the conventional procedure and liquid reagents ( Fig. 6 bottom right) .

We performed the complete processing protocol manually and with the LoC device using this medium as sample input material. All manual performed steps were done similar to the steps performed in the LoC device, applying freeze-dried reagents, too. For detection, the median fluorescence intensity values were measured with the LiquiChip 200 workstation. The via LoC system processed sample showed approx. 50% of the MFIs when compared to the manually processed sample. Optimizing the complex protocol further the different parameters will merge even better and better results will be achievable. Additional benchmark tests were done to compare the performance of the prototype device with commercially available kits and nucleic acid preparation devices (preparation: BioRobot EZ1 Workstation with EZ1 Virus Mini Kit extraction protocol; amplification and detection: QIAGEN ResPlex II Panel v2.0). As a \"positive\" sample, we spiked 1 ml of Copan UTM medium that already contained the biomaterial from a nasopharyngeal swab with an ADV Standard from ZeptoMetrix Corp. The signal intensity of the via LoC system processed sample showed 81% of the signal intensity of the references. Since the experimental results vary strongly for the references already (see, e.g., MFIs in Figs. 6 and 7) , results should be determined as signal ratios rather than absolute signal values.",

Next to functionality another focus of this development laid on the manufacturability of the system. By permanent checking manufacturability and availability of the components used, this approach led to a LoC system suitable for serial production. The system can easily be adapted to different pathogens and may thus offer a route to open new markets for in-vitro diagnostics. One remaining major challenge of LoC systems in general, is to make them more robust yet keep them affordable. It appears that simplifying both the assay and the instrument will be the key to achieve this goal (Kim et al. 2009 ). As it turned out during this work, much of what is today considered the state of the art in microfluidic construction strategies fails to meet said demands. We therefore think that our valve design and simple stirring process represent a clear improvement over established construction principles in terms of ease of production, robustness, and reliability.",

The functionality was demonstrated by the direct comparison of samples processed manually vs. automatically using the \"ResPlex Panel II v2.0\" for the detection of respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal samples. Experiments showed comparable results of the developed system in comparison to conventional lab procedures and therefore provide an excellent basis for further optimization. It is envisaged to reduce complexity of the chip by simplifying the assay and the electro-mechanical device and to integrate the detection to end up with an all-in-one LoC-system.",
