Children aged 5 to 13 years who had an ARI were enrolled from the outpatient department (OPD) 1 or 2 days/week; patients who presented to the ED were enrolled 1 to 4 days/week. ARI was defined as an illness that presented with fever and/or 1 or more of the following symptoms: cough, earache, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, vomiting after coughing, wheezing, and/or labored, rapid, or shallow breathing. Children were excluded if their symptoms were present for >14 days, if they had chemotherapy-associated neutropenia, or if they had been hospitalized within the previous 4 days. Additional details of the NVSN study design have been reported [1, 8]. After informed consent was provided by the parent/guardian, caretakers were interviewed to obtain demographic and clinical information, including underlying medical conditions, presence and duration of symptoms and signs of ARI, and complications of illness. Medical records were also reviewed for clinical and laboratory information. Information on conditions considered to confer higher risk for respiratory illnesses, including premature birth (<36 weeks\u2019 gestation), chronic pulmonary disease (including asthma), cardiac, renal, or immunodeficiency disease, cancer, or sickle cell anemia, was also obtained. Nasal and throat swabs were also obtained from each child for virologic testing [8]. After the enrollment visit, the medical records for each encounter were reviewed and recorded; the information we captured included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis codes assigned by the respective medical center\u2019s professional coders.",

The only clinical feature of HMPV infection observed in our cohort that differed significantly from those with HMPV-negative ARI was cough, which was present almost universally (53 [98%] of 54) in children with HMPV infection. This result suggests that HMPV ARI is associated with a higher proportion of lower respiratory tract disease than HMPV-negative ARI, particularly given that HMPV infection was also associated with an incidence of coded pneumonia or bronchiolitis diagnosis that was higher than that in the HMPV-negative group. A preexisting asthma diagnosis was associated with a discharge diagnosis of asthma, although it was not significantly associated with detection of HMPV or a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia.",

Rates of HMPV-associated hospitalization are highest among children <6 months old, but the rates of HMPV-associated outpatient visits among children aged 6 to 59 months remain similar to the rates among young infants [1]. This pattern is in contrast to that observed for RSV and coronavirus infection, for which rates of symptomatic illness and hospitalization decrease markedly after 1 year of age [10, 11]. Thus, our findings support the assertion that HMPV, similar to influenza [12], causes clinically significant disease not only during early childhood but also throughout later childhood. This observation is further supported by findings from another multicenter prospective population-based study of hospitalized children with pneumonia in which the incidence of HMPV-associated pneumonia was highest among children <5 years old but also remained prevalent in 5- to 9- and 10- to 17-year-old children [7].",

An additional 1060 HMPV infections occurred that were associated with outpatient visits, ED visits, or brief (<24-hour) hospitalizations. Although those 1060 episodes associated with outpatient visits, ED visits, and brief hospitalizations were not stratified according to age, the prevalence of HMPV detection among outpatients in our study suggests that children aged >5 years might contribute substantially to this burden.",

First, the study population might not be representative of the entire US population or that of other locations, despite the large number of patients enrolled at our 3 study sites. Second, children were enrolled only between November and May. Thus, our estimate might not represent the overall outpatient/ED burden of HMPV infection in older children, given that HMPV infection has been associated with biannual periodicity in some studies, and its seasonality might extend beyond May [13]. We enrolled children in outpatient and ED settings but not inpatients, although patients seen in outpatient and ED settings who were admitted were included. Thus, detailed features of more complicated or severe HMPV infections in older children who were directly admitted to the hospital were not captured in our study. Moreover, the numbers enrolled did not allow us to calculate rates of HMPV-associated hospitalization among older children. Our analysis did not examine the clinical features of infections with viruses other than HMPV, so direct comparisons of the features of HMPV infection with those of other viruses in older children cannot be made.",
