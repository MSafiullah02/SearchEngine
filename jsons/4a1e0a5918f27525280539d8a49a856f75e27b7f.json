Lung US has a higher diagnostic accuracy than physical examination and chest radiography combined. 8 For many years, direct sonographic evaluation of lung parenchyma was considered inaccessible because of the presence of air. The high acoustic mismatch between the lung air and adjacent extra-pulmonary tissue creates a complete reflection of the ultrasound beam, and creates an ultrasound image of air artefacts without any discernable imaging of the lung parenchyma. 9 However, it is now recognized that pathology of the lung create distinct artefacts that can be used to diagnose pathology and guide therapy. 4 Lung US has proved to be useful in the evaluation of many different acute conditions, namely cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute lung injury, pneumothorax, pneumonia, and pleural effusions. With the appropriate training and supervision, the intensivist can use ultrasound to diagnose lung pathology rapidly, as well as plan and monitor therapy in real-time.",

The lung tissue in this region is completely de-aerated, either due to extensive atelectasis or a 7 pneumonic process. 23 The anterior zones tend to be spared and therefore signs of aeration may be present. (Figure 1b) . This pattern of lung injury (H phenotype) resembles ARDS and those patients may benefit from high levels of PEEP and prone positioning (Figure 2) . 4, 16, 21 In both patterns, use of low tidal volume ventilation (6ml/kg predicted body weight), and low plateau and driving pressures (less than 30 and 15cmH 2 O respectively) to reduce the risk of VILI, is paramount. 24 It has been argued, that patients with L phenotype profile (pattern 1 on LUS) can be safely ventilated with higher tidal volumes (7-8 ml/kg predicted body weight) given the preserved respiratory system compliance (resulting in lower plateau and driving pressures). 25 The ARMA trial, however, demonstrated that patients with ARDS can have preserved pulmonary compliance and that this subgroup of patients would still benefit from low volume/low pressure ventilation. 24 It would therefore be prudent to avoid use of liberal tidal volumes in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and 'injured' lungs.",

This is in part due to the logistics of transferring the sheer volume of patients out of 'hot zones' and the risk of exposure and transmission that this involves. Our colleagues in both China and Italy have found LUS to be a suitable alternative to computed tomography (CT) in times where rapid diagnosis, triage and evaluation of ventilation strategies is required, and when CT is not a feasible option.[12][13][14] However, the main reason LUS has been the favored imaging modality is due to its ability to identify and serially evaluate progression or indeed resolution of superficial pathology, in particular the lung signs and 'patterns' we now know to be characteristic of SARS-CoV-2.12 Characteristic sonographic findings, first described by Chinese intensivists, with consensus from clinicians of other affected countries, include: 1) thickened, irregular pleural line; 2) B lines (focal, multifocal and diffuse); 3) consolidation varying from focal, non-translobar to translobar with or without air-bronchograms; 4) A lines, indicating air under the pleural line, during the recovery phase; and 5) pleural effusions (less common). 8, 12-17 B lines are a form of reverberation artefact, produced as a result of the interaction between ultrasound as it encounters a mix of fluid and air.8,17",

Prone ventilation should be considered in refractory cases. Response to proning and its physiological efficacy in this group of patients is likely related to redistribution of blood flow and offloading of the right ventricle rather than homogenous distribution of transpulmonary pressure and recruitment (Figure 2). 4, 10, 21, 22",
