            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a new virus that was first discovered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 2012.[1] Many cases of MERS-CoV have since been confirmed worldwide. Around 80% of the MERS-CoV cases were discovered and confirmed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).[2] It is estimated that 1625 cases have been diagnosed with MERS-CoV globally, with 1283 specifically in (KSA). At the time of publishing of this manuscript, 551 deaths had been recorded. In April 2014, the incidence of MERS-CoV dramatically increased and was found to be equal to the number of all cases detected before that month. Numerous hypotheses have been made to explain this dramatic increase in incidence.[2] The basic hypotheses being that viral change in the form of mutation facilitated the dissemination of the virus in health-care facilities and the transmission from animal to human. It seems that MERS-CoV has a predilection to specific months, leading to dramatic increases in incidence from March to April. Many studies have shown that camels may play a role in zoonotic transmission to humans.[2] The clinical features of MERS-CoV infection vary from very simple cases that can be managed in outpatient settings to very complicated ones that require admission to the intensive care unit. However, the most common symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which are no different from other influenza infections.[3] The seriousness of MERS-CoV infection is a worldwide health concern.",

Furthermore, about six million pilgrims come to Saudi Arabia for Umrah throughout the year, and another two million, come to fulfill their fifth pillar of Islam, \u201cHajj.\u201d These events put the pilgrims at an increased risk of contracting and transmitting infections both within and outside the KSA. Some countries such as Germany, UK, France, Italy, Tunisia, Malaysia, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates[45] reported incidences of MERS-CoV after their citizens returned from Hajj in 2013. The most common cause of hospital admissions during Hajj is respiratory diseases.[6] Assessing the different aspects of knowledge about MERS-CoV, and the protective precautions that can be taken against it among pilgrims will help to determine the need for MERS-CoV educational programs. To the best of our knowledge, there are hardly any studies that address issues relating to pilgrims.",

Self-administered structured questionnaires were distributed and collected from 417 Arab participants at their convenience at King Fahad Extension, King Abdullah Prayer Extension area, and King Abdullah Piazza Extension after Taraweeh and Fajr prayers. The data collectors introduced themselves to the respondents, briefed them about the study, and took their verbal consent. They handed out the questionnaires, which required 5 min to complete.

Differences in respondents' knowledge about MERS-CoV across genders, age, nationality, etc., were assessed by independent t-tests/analysis of variance (ANOVA). Participants who selected the right answer were given a score of one for each of the 31 knowledge questions. Those who did not know the answer or answered incorrectly were given a zero for the question. The sum score out of 31 was multiplied by a constant to make a final score of 100. Multivariate stepwise linear regression model was used to identify the predictors associated with knowledge of MERS-CoV.

Majority of the participants believed that MERS-CoV may lead to respiratory compromise (61%) and death (65%), while only 18% thought that there were no complications to MERS-CoV infection. Participants correctly believed that using a facemask (85.3%), hand washing (85.3%), using hand sanitizer (83.3%), avoiding contact with infected patients (82.4%), sneezing into a tissue (82.6%), and avoiding touching eyes and nose (76%) could prevent MERS-CoV transmission.
