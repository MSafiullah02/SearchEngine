To this end, we developed a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for the contagion, and we used official data of the pandemic up to March 30th, 2020 for identifying the parameters of this model. The non standard part of our approach resides in the fact that we considered as model parameters also the initial number of susceptible individuals, as well as the proportionality factor relating the detected number of positives with the actual (and unknown) number of infected individuals. Identifying the contagion, recovery and death rates as well as the mentioned parameters amounts to a non-convex identification problem that we solved by means of a two-dimensional grid search in the outer loop, with a standard weighted least-squares optimization problem as the inner step.",

Models can also be crucial in a number of other tasks, such as estimation of transmission parameters, understanding of contagion mechanisms, simulation of different epidemic scenarios, and test of various hypotheses.",

            "text": "Several kind of models have been proposed for describing the time evolution of epidemics, among which we distinguish two main groups: collective models and networked models. Collective models are characterized by a small number of parameters and describe the epidemic spread in a population using a limited number of collective variables. They include generalized growth models [1] , logistic models [2] , Richards models [3] , Generalized Richards models [1] , subepidemics wave models [4] , Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models [2] , [5] , and Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) models [1] . SIR, SEIR and other similar models belong to the class of the so-called compartmental models [1] , [6] . Networked models typically treat a population as a network of interacting individuals and the contagion process is described at the level of each individual, see, G e.g., [7] - [13] . These models clearly provide a more detailed description of the epidemic spread than collective models but their identification is significantly harder. A first reason is that they are usually characterized by a high number of parameters and variables. A second reason, perhaps more relevant, is that the network topology is unknown in most real situations and its identification is an extremely hard task. In this paper, we focus on collective models since, thanks to their relative simplicity, they can be more suitable for nonexpert operators and public health authorities, and they can provide simple but reliable models, even under scarcity of data.",

However, the identification of such parameters raises several practical issues, as discussed next. An important variable in many epidemic models is the number of individuals that are infected at a given time. However, in a real epidemic scenario, only the number of infected individuals that have been detected as \"positive\" is available, while the actual number of infected people remains unknown. A common assumption made in the literature is that the observed cases are the actual ones. Clearly, this assumption is unrealistic and may lead to wrong epidemiological interpretations/conclusions. Other issues stem from the fact that identification of epidemic models requires in many cases to deal with non-convex optimization problems. Indeed, a key feature of an epidemic model is to provide reliable results in long-term predictions, in order to allow analysis/comparison of different scenarios and design of suitable control strategies. Hence, identification has to be performed with the objective of minimizing the model multi-step prediction error. This typically requires solving a non-convex optimization problem, even when the model is linear in the parameters, with the ensuing relevant risk of being trapped in poorly-performing local solutions. Furthermore, the initial values of some model variables have often to be identified, in addition to the model parameters, and this also requires solution of a non-convex optimization problem.",

As discussed above, this quantity is important from the epidemiological standpoint. The second contribution consists in a model identification and prediction framework that allowed us to overcome the mentioned problems in the modeling of the infection evolution of the present COVID-19 pandemics. The model identification approach is based on a simple yet practically effective scheme: a model structure is assumed, characterized by a set of parameters to be identified. A grid is defined for those few (two, in the actual model considered here) parameters on which the model has a nonlinear dependence (with some abuse of terminology, these are called the nonlinear parameters). For each point of this grid, the other parameters are identified via convex optimization. Finally, the optimal parameter estimate is chosen as one minimizing a suitable objective function over the grid. This approach is particularly suitable for epidemic collective models, which typically feature a low number of nonlinear parameters. Clearly, when the number of such parameters is large, the approach becomes computationally unfeasible.",

To overcome this issue, we employed a novel long-term prediction algorithm, based on a weighted average of the multi-step predictions performed by starting the simulation at all the available initial conditions. The weighted average allows a reduction of noise and error effects, possibly yielding significant improvements in the long-term prediction accuracy.",

Nonetheless, the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3,\u03bd, and \u03c9 can be determined by using the following Algorithm 1, which computes the model parameters that better fit the data by gridding the variables \u03b1, \u03c9, using (7) to determine MSE(\u03b1, \u03c9), and solving min \u03b1,\u03c9 MSE(\u03b1, \u03c9). Table I reports the values of the parameters obtained using Algorithm 1 considering either each region disjointedly or all the Italian cases of COVID-19 with \u03b1 = 100 and \u03c1 = 0.9. defineS as in (4) 5:",

Algorithm 2, has also been used for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in the most affected regions of Italy. V. DISCUSSION This work has been done in the urgency of the ongoing COVID-19 contagion, with the purpose of providing a simple yet effective explanatory model for prediction of the future evolution of the contagion, and verification of the effectiveness of the containment and lockdown measures. One significant feature of the proposed model is the identification, simultaneously with model parameters, of the \u03b1 factor that relates the number of detected positives with the unknown number of actual infected individuals in the population. For the aggregated data of Italy, such factor has been estimated to a value of about 63. This in turns affects the real mortality rate of the infection which, if computed on the basis of the detected positives would amount to the quite high value of \u03bd = 1.18%, whereas if referred to the number of actual infected individuals would decrease to \u03bd =\u03bd/\u03b1 = 0.019%. This seemingly high proportionality factor \u03b1 = 63 appears to be actually in line with today's (March 30, 2020) estimates provided by Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team in [17] , who foresee a total infected figure of about 5.9 million (with an uncertainty range of [1.9 -15.2] million). Indeed, today's (March 30, 2020) cumulative number of detected positive individuals in Italy is 101739 which, multiplied by \u03b1 = 63, yields a figure of about 6.4 million infected, that is well within the range estimated in [17] . It is to be observed that the present identification results are quite sensitive to the input data and that, due to time constraints, we could not run a suitable Monte-Carlo analysis for inferring intervals of reliability for the model parameters and predictions. Due to the large uncertainty in the data collection procedures, however, we can expect the same type of high variability reported in [17] , that is, for instance, \u00b178% uncertainty on the real number of total infected individuals. Finally, notice that the data we used for tuning the model run up to March 30th, 2020. As it can be seen in Figure 3 most recent data show a substantial decrease of the number of infected individuals, which is imputable to the coming into effect, after a delay of about two weeks, of the lockdown measures imposed by the government. Clearly, the underlying process is non-stationary, and the predictions of the model tuned using data up to March 30th, 2020 will (hopefully) be pessimistic, as the lockdown will drastically change the underlying mechanics of the contagion.
