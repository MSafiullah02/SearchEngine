Left panel: SUD-N domain. Since the resonances of SUD-N were assigned as a group (see text), the NOEs are plotted in the order of increasing values of I rel . Right panel: SUD-M domain, where the data are plotted versus the (a) Overlay of the 2D [ 15 N, 1 H]-HSQC spectra of SUD-MC in the absence (red) and presence (blue) of (GGA) 4 at an RNA:protein ratio of 0.5:1. (b) 2D [ 15 N, 1 H]-HSQC spectrum of SUD-C. This spectrum is shown here as a reference, to facilitate the identification of peaks originating from SUD-C in panel (a). (c) Plot versus the amino acid sequences of chemical shift perturbations, \u0394\u03b4, induced by (GGA) 4binding to SUD-M (red) and SUD-MC (blue) at an RNA:protein ratio of 0.2:1. (d) Spacefilling view of SUD-M visualizing the surface locations of chemical shift perturbations induced by adding 0.2 equivalents of (GGA) 4 to SUD-MC. The residues with \u0394\u03b4 \u2265 0.03 are colored green, and are labeled. (e) Plot versus the amino acid sequence of the decrease of the [ 15 N, 1 H]-HSQC peak intensities, \u0394(S/N), in SUD-MC after addition of 0.5 equivalents of (GGA) 4 . \u0394(S/N) is equal to the difference between the signal:noise ratios of the correlation peaks in the presence and absence of (GGA) 4 , respectively. Since it is unlikely that line broadening due to slow ligand exchange would affect all resonances of the SUD-M domain, the observations in panel (e) appear to indicate formation of higher aggregates mediated by the RNA binding. In these aggregates only the SUD-M domains would appear to be immobilized, whereas the SUD-C domains seem to retain mobility within the aggregate so that they do not experience significant line broadening. Codon-optimized DNA sequences used for the production of the SUD proteins used in this study. Restriction enzyme sites derived from the vectors and used to clone the constructs (5': NdeI, 3': HindIII) are in italics. Protease recognition sites (thrombin in SUD-MC, TEV protease in all other constructs) are underlined. For SUD-C, the additional thrombin cleavage site derived from pET-28b precedes the S7 construct and is not shown. Stop codons were added at the 3'-end of each construct, immediately preceding the HindIII restriction site.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "search of the PDB.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>PDB ID, chain IDa\n</td><td>Zb </td><td>RMSDc </td><td>%Iseqd </td><td>Proteine </td><td>Activitye\n</td></tr><tr><td>2p1x-A </td><td>4.4 </td><td>2.7 </td><td>10 </td><td>CyaY (bacterial frataxin) </td><td>Iron binding, iron-sulfur cluster assembly </td></tr><tr><td>1k90-C </td><td>4.4 </td><td>2.1 </td><td>10 </td><td>Anthrax edema factor (EF) </td><td>Calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase </td></tr><tr><td>2w03-B </td><td>4.1 </td><td>2.6 </td><td>5 </td><td>Achromobactin synthetase protein D (AcsD) </td><td>Citrate adenylation </td></tr><tr><td>1ylx-A </td><td>3.6 </td><td>3 </td><td>9 </td><td>Hypothetical protein </td><td>Unknown </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>APC35702, Bacillus stearothermophilus </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>1d0q-B </td><td>3.6 </td><td>3.3 </td><td>13 </td><td>B. stearothermophilus DNA primase zinc-binding domain </td><td>ssDNA binding in RNA primer synthesis dsDNA binding (putative) </td></tr><tr><td>2fki-A </td><td>3.5 </td><td>3 </td><td>5 </td><td>Escherichia coli protein </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>YjbR, putative double-wing motif DNA-binding protein </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>1lvn-A </td><td>3.5 </td><td>2.9 </td><td>9 </td><td>E. coli copper amine oxidase </td><td>Oxidation of primary aromatic amines </td></tr><tr><td>2fql-A </td><td>3.4 </td><td>3.1 </td><td>7 </td><td>S. cerevisiae mitochondrial frataxin </td><td>Iron binding and homeostasis </td></tr><tr><td>2oc6-B </td><td>3.4 </td><td>3.1 </td><td>7 </td><td>B. subtilis hypothetical protein YdhG </td><td>Unknown </td></tr><tr><td>2fug-7 </td><td>3.3 </td><td>3.4 </td><td>8 </td><td>Respiratory complex I, </td><td>Iron binding, complex assembly </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>subunit Nqo15, Thermus thermophilus </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>2bho-A </td><td>3.3 </td><td>3.1 </td><td>10 </td><td>Type III secretion chaperone SycT, Yersinia enterocolitica </td><td>Protein binding, molecular chaperone </td></tr><tr><td>3fwm-A </td><td>3.3 </td><td>3.5 </td><td>7 </td><td>'UB2H' domain of transglycosylase/penicillin-\n</td><td>Protein binding </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>binding protein 1b, E. coli </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>3cxj-D </td><td>3.3 </td><td>3 </td><td>8 </td><td>Uncharacterized protein, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus </td><td>Unknown dsDNA binding </td></tr><tr><td>1kaf-D </td><td>3.2 </td><td>3.3 </td><td>3 Double-wing motif DNA-binding domain of </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>bacteriophage T4 transcription factor MotA </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>2fo3-A </td><td>3.1 </td><td>3.3 </td><td>7 </td><td>Plasmodium vivax ubiquitin-\n</td><td>Linking proteins to ubiquitin </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>conjugating enzyme E2 </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>1jov-A </td><td>3 </td><td>2.8 </td><td>9 </td><td>Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI1317 </td><td>Unknown </td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": []}
