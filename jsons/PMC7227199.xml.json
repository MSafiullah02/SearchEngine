Apart from antiviral agents, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been examined for their roles in treatment of COVID-19.1 This may be because both CQ and HCQ have been postulated to reduce viral replication in other coronavirus infections.2,3 According to a recent systematic review, there are almost 20 ongoing randomized controlled clinical trials on both medications for treatment of COVID-19 and all of them are in China. The details including dosing regimens of CQ and HCQ in these trials have been summarized in the review.4 Although there has not yet been a completed clinical trial and the world is waiting eagerly for the results of these trials and other trials on other treatment options, many authorities have chosen to adopt CQ and HCQ in the guidelines for treatment of COVID-19 based on in vitro studies,2,3 nonrandomized trial,5 and anecdotal evidence.6\u201311 As the therapeutic doses of CQ and HCQ recommended in the trials and guidelines are relatively high compared with the maximum daily safe dose that is related to CQ and HCQ retinal toxicity, this issue of retinal toxicity should be taken into consideration when employing these 2 medications for treatment of COVID-19 worldwide.",

The toxicity, which causes irreversible retinal damage and visual loss despite ceasing prescription, requires exposure to the safe dose for a long period of time, generally in excess of 5 years. In general, the recommendation for screening for retinal toxicity from CQ and HCQ is within the first year of use as baseline and then annual screening after a year of use for CQ13 and 5 years of use for HCQ.12 Both American Academy of Ophthalmology and RCO recommended the screening should be conducted sooner if the major risk factors are present.12,13 In the case of treatment of COVID-19 using CQ and HCQ, the major risk factor is the use of higher than generally recommended dosage, although over a relatively short period of time, that is for about a week. There has not yet been a report on retinal toxicity associated with this kind of treatment. Nonetheless, it has been reported that retinal toxicity can develop even after <1 year of high dose of HCQ use (1000 mg daily) in an oncology trial.14",

Both agents have also been shown to cause damage to the photoreceptor layer and outer nuclear layer of the retina, whereas CQ can cause damage to the inner retina as well. Light absorption and metabolism of cone cells may also play roles for the damages. These mechanisms may lead to clinically characteristic \u201cbull's eye\u201d maculopathy after chronic exposure to both agents even in the safe dose.15 It is not known whether exposure to the high dose over a short period may also cause similar cellular damages as with the chronic exposure. Given that patients with COVID-19 who may require treatment are commonly older patients, it is possible that some may already have coexistent age-related macular degeneration. It is still not known whether the diseased macula would be more vulnerable to damage with exposure to the high dose of either CQ or HCQ even over a short duration.",

Further controlled clinical trial data will be necessary to help better address this issue. Despite the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic, many adverse effects of either CQ or HCQ should still be weighed against its potential benefit. For retinal toxicity, the risk of having irreversible retinal damage and visual loss may outweigh the unproven benefit of both agents in some patients. Detecting the risk is easy.
