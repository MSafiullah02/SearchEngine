            "text": "The placenta plays a crucial role in maintaining fetal well-being, growth, and development during pregnancy.5 Placental evidence of antenatal insults correlates with morbidities and mortality in preterm infants, but there is conflicting evidence of an association between different placental pathologies and neonatal outcomes.6,7 Many studies have been limited by small sample size, selection bias, and use of different definitions for various placental pathologies, resulting in a range of classifications. Moreover, most of the studies have described an association between a single placental pathology lesion and neonatal outcomes, e.g., acute histologic chorioamnionitis (AHC) and BPD, maternal vascular underperfusion (MVU) and BPD, etc.8\u201310 Recently, Chisholm et al.11 have provided a detailed review of placental pathology and associated neonatal morbidities in which they noted an association between placental pathology with neonatal morbidities, including BPD; however, they did not correct for multiple placental pathologic lesions and did not examine neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). Mestan et al.12 used the Redline classification for placental pathologic lesions and reported that placental pathologic changes of MVU are associated with BPD and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in preterm infants. They did not correct for multiple placental pathologic lesions, i.e., the presence of \u22652 pathologic lesions. Thus the presence of multiple placental lesions and its association with preterm outcomes remain unknown. We hypothesize that multiple placental pathologic lesions are associated with BPD and NDI in preterm infants born <29 weeks GA. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the association of placental pathology with neonatal death, BPD, and subsequent NDI in preterm infants using a uniform classification of placental histopathology, (2) describe the incidence of multiple placental lesions, and (3) determine whether their presence is associated with the occurrence of neonatal death, BPD, and NDI.",

            "text": "Placentas from all preterm births at Parkland Hospital are routinely submitted for gross and histologic examination by a placental pathologist according to a standing protocol as described briefly.13 Initial gross examination of the umbilical cord, membranes, and placental disc was performed. Placental weight was obtained after removal of the umbilical cord, fetal membranes, and non-adherent blood clots. The placental disk was sectioned at 1\u20132-cm intervals and examined for intraparenchymal lesions. Representative sections of the umbilical cord, fetal membranes, placental parenchyma, and any abnormalities seen on gross examination were submitted for standard histological examination. During the time that study cases were accumulated, the pathologists at our institution used the Redline classification to describe major placental findings.14 The a priori definition of \u201csignificant placental pathology\u201d was determined by an independent pathologist blinded to patient health information, including the clinical outcomes. This definition is standardized at our institution and excludes minor placental pathology in each major category of placental pathologies that have little or no clinical consequence and are considered to be present in most of the placental histologic examinations of normal term neonates. The definition of \u201csignificant placental pathology\u201d is based on modified Redline classification that we recently published.15 This includes the following placental pathologies: (1) AHC\u2014maternal inflammatory response: presence of maternal inflammatory responses (acute subchorionitis or acute chorioamnionitis); AHC\u2014fetal inflammatory response (vasculitis in the umbilical vessels and/or chorionic plate vessels). (2) High-grade villitis: patchy/diffuse chronic villitis with or without obliterative fetal vasculopathy; chronic villitis was defined as the presence of chronic inflammation of chorionic villi. High-grade lesions included inflammatory foci involving >10 villi/focus, either limited in distribution (patchy) or more extensive (diffuse). (3) MVU: MVU was defined by distal villous hypoplasia, severe maternal decidual vasculopathy (fibrinoid necrosis and/or acute atheromatous changes), and/or infarcts involving >20% of the placental volume. (4) Fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (FTV): the two variables of large vessel thrombi and villous damage from reduced fetal perfusion (avascular villi or villous stromal vascular karyorrhexis) were grouped under the heading of FTV. (5) Small for GA (SGA)/large for GA (LGA) placentas: trimmed placental weight <10th percentile for GA was defined as SGA placenta and >90th percentile for GA was defined as LGA placenta.16 Presence of any one of the six lesions described was considered as significant placental pathology. The presence of more than one of the defined placental lesions was classified as multiple placental pathology. We previously reported 100% concordance between the routine placental pathology report and independent review of placenta by a blinded pediatric pathologist.15 All placental pathology reports were reviewed by a pediatric pathologist and neonatologist (S.J.-W. and I.N.M.), who were blinded to the clinical history and outcomes. Study patients were divided into three groups based on placental pathology: (1) No placental pathology, (2) One significant placental pathology, and (3) Multiple placental pathologic lesions (presence of \u22652 significant lesions).",

A possible vascular hypothesis explaining this association suggests that placental pathology such as MVU results in placental insufficiency that in turn may lead to: (1) decreases in angiogenic factors such as placental growth factors and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A),25,26 (2) excess of amniotic fluid anti-angiogenic factors such as VEGF receptor antagonist gms-like tyrokinase-1,27 and (3) subsequent chronic fetal hypoxia.28 These factors may also result in disruption of pulmonary vascular growth/development and alveolarization.28 Notably, the presence of chronic hypoxia in fetal sheep that is associated with MVU and the development of placental insufficiency leads to the classic histologic findings of BPD.29 The alternative inflammatory hypothesis for the occurrence of BPD suggests chorioamnionitis results in a systemic fetal inflammatory response causing increased pulmonary expression of proinflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, and remodeling of the fetal lungs.30,31 Notably, this inflammation may also be associated with attenuated responses to exogenous surfactant therapy and thus the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.32 Colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum or Ureaplasma pravum or increased risk of postnatal sepsis may also contribute to the development of BPD in preterm infants with histologic acute chorioamnionitis on placental examination.33 We speculate that the association of BPD with multiple placental lesions, but not with isolated pathology, suggests that there are interactive effects between vascular and inflammatory processes that promote the development of BPD. This is especially relevant since not all preterm infants exposed to chorioamnionitis or to MVU develop BPD. Therefore, it is possible that multiple/severe insults need to occur over the course of pregnancy, rather than an isolated event, in order to increase the risk of developing of BPD in neonates <29 weeks GA.",

Similar to BPD, studies have been done to show an association between NDI and various placental pathologies, including chorioamnionitis, MVU, FTV, and chronic villitis; but these associations have been inconsistent.10,34\u201336 For instance, although the association between AHC and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes has been studied, the association is quite variable, with some reporting that AHC is a significant predictor of cerebral palsy34 and NDI,10 while others reporting no adverse association between AHC and neurodevelopmental outcome.35 Similarly, there are few studies that have examined MVU and NDI.36 It has been suggested that MVU may lead to fetal hypoxia, which contributes to the breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier and triggers glutamate excitotoxicity. Free radicals in combination with a developmental lack of antioxidant enzymes in oligodendrocytes may explain the impact of hypoxia on the premature brain.37 While significant association between placental infarction (suggesting MVU) and NDI has been reported,38 this was not seen by others.39 This variability in the previous studies may, in part, be accounted for by a lack of statistical power, retrospective analysis, and differences in time of neurodevelopmental assessments. Moreover, none of these studies evaluated multiple lesions. In our study, infants with multiple placental pathologic lesions were more likely to have moderate-to-severe NDI; however, after adjusting for potential confounders, this association disappeared. As in BPD, it is possible that there is interactive effect between placental vascular and inflammatory lesions on the occurrence of cerebral injury, but a larger cohort is needed to examine this association.",

We also assessed a large variety of placental lesions, defined their significance a priori, used a uniform method for classification, and assessed multiple lesions. Our study did have some limitations such as its retrospective nature. Even though logistic regression was done to account for known variables, it is possible that unknown confounders are not accounted for. We did not collect the data on ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and Score for neonatal acute physiology with perinatal extenstion (SNAP-PE), as these data are not collected routinely at our institution. It is highly likely that multiple placental lesions not only indicate an interaction between vascular and inflammatory lesions but may also indicate severity of the vascular or inflammatory insult. Future studies should explore role of such lesions and the interaction in pathogenesis of neonatal morbidities.",
