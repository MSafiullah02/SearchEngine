            "text": "new health system reorganization. In Lombardy (the most hit Italian region), hospitals saturated their bed availability, as overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. Intensive care units crashed down, requiring the transfer of patients to other hospitals outside region, or in some cases outside the country. Since the beginning of March, all elective procedures stopped, guaranteeing only urgent or emergent operations.Regional Health system identified 4 Hub centers out of 20 cardiothoracic departments in all Lombardy, serving more than 10 million of people. Interestingly, despite a large amount of patients, few cases per weeks have been operated, pointing out that people fears COVID-19 rather than heart attack or dissection.Life style has changed, my job has temporary changed. I started taking care COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, one cardiothoracic hub center allowed my team to perform one urgent case from our waiting list. Per policy, the following protection procedures were established: 1. Self-isolation for at least 14 days (incubation period) whenever possible;2. Nasal swab screening for COVID-19 done the same day of admission in hospital, keeping the patient isolated like COVID-19 infection; 3. All medical and nurse staff must wear personal protective equipment (PPE) until swab test is negative; 4. All surgical staff keeps an ffp3 mask plus surgical mask during operation to avoid contamination from patient to surgeon and vice versa; 5. Intensive care, high dependency unit and ward COVID-19 free. Despite these measures, there is still a percentage of COVID infection. Data from other hospitals shows that there is still some patients infected, who may escape this strict surveillance. The risk of not following the policy of PPE by health personnel, asymptomatic patient's visitors, false negative or precocious swab tests may be at the basis of COVID-19 spread in hospitals. To reduce the risk of SARS-COV2 nosocomial transmission, Mayeur et coll propose to suspend all pre-operative nasal swab screening for Staphyloccus aureus (SA) (2). Cardiac surgery patients colonized with SA have a greater risk of surgical site infection and their identification is mandatory for good outcome (3). I agree with authors that all patients should be considered positive for SA. However, in this world crisis, the focus is COVID-19 infection. All cardiac patients should be considered positive for COVID-19 and elective cardiac surgery have to be stopped. The risk of dying for pneumonia is too high for low risk surgery. It seems that the average person infected with coronavirus contaminates between 2-3 people. In light of my considerations, only emergent or urgent operation should be performed. The strict observance of protective measures and the interruption of elective surgical procedure will enhance the security and safety of patients and healthcare personnel. Whilst the infection advances in other countries, the social distancing has brought its first positive effects in Italy. Meantime, we learnt the importance of a hug with friends and family, solidarity and time. We will win this war and see the rainbow. It's gonna be ok!",
