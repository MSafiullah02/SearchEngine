The GHI adopts an integrated approach to fighting diseases, improving health, and strengthening health systems. During the past 10 years, the field of global infectious diseases has witnessed tremendous challenges and opportunities, including the continuous struggle to control and prevent the HIV/AIDS pandemic and to tackle emerging or reemerging infectious diseases, including multidrug-resistant and extensively drugresistant tuberculosis (TB), 1 novel emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, 2 the avian influenza virus H5N1, 3 and the current pandemic of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. 4 These infections have been well contained in developed countries, thanks to well-established laboratorysupported surveillance systems. However, laboratory services and systems are weak in resource-poor countries (RPCs). The new GHI, together with the surge in funding and commitment for programs to fight HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, and flu in RPCs (an estimated $10 billion per annum is devoted to tackling the HIV/AIDS pandemic 5,6 ), offers a monumental opportunity to strengthen laboratory systems in RPCs that could be used to combat multiple diseases.",

With funding from PEPFAR, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg, South Africa, recently established the African Center for Integrated Laboratory Training (ACILT). The ACILT was created after in-depth consultation on laboratory training needs of several African countries, in collaboration with the WHO Regional Office for Africa. The courses used a competency-based approach for the trainees to obtain knowledge and skills at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases; attendees then returned to their countries and developed competencies while working under supervision and received follow-up visits by the core training staff of ACILT. This training approach is similar to the short-course component of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-supported field epidemiology training programs in several RPCs. In these programs, field epidemiologists and public health laboratory staff are jointly trained in long courses (ie, 2-year public health leadership training) and short courses (ie, 1-to 2-week public health implementer training) to acquire skills and develop competencies while providing a public health service. 29 These were modeled on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Epidemic Intelligence Service.
