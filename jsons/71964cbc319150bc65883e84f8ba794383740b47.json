Briefly, the first case was a previously healthy 6year old boy who developed fever and shortness of breath. Despite antibiotic treatment he deteriorated and Chest X-Ray showed right lower lobe opacification. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was positive for influenza A and PCR showed positive result for H5 and negative for H1 and H3. He was started on oseltamivir 2 days before death. The second case was a 33 year old man with previous good health who was admitted with a 4-day history of fever, malaise, sore throat and cough with blood-stained sputum. Chest X-Ray showed right lower-lobe consolidation. Despite treatment with oseltamivir 2 days after admission his condition deteriorated and he developed ARDS. PCR for H5 was positive on day 6 of illness -the day on which he died. The clinical profiles of the nine SARS patients used in our study have been previously reported (Nicholls et al., 2006) . Human lung obtained from a patient who died of extra-pulmonary disease served as a normal control and was kindly provided by Prof. D. Kerjaschki, Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, according to ethical guidelines.",

Balb/c, 129Sv, and C57BL/6 mice were bred at our animal facility. C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeOuJ mice were purchased from Jackson laboratories. Of note, the ncf1 splice mutation was originally identified in the diabetic mouse strains C57BL/6J-m db/db and db/+ (Huang et al., 2000) and backcrossed to the B10.Q backgrounds for more than 12 generations to outcross the diabetic phenotype (Hultqvist et al. 2004 ). Mice harboring a floxed TRAF6 allele will be reported in detail in the future and were crossed onto LysCre mice (Clausen et al., 1999) to delete TRAF6 in macrophages and neutrophils. Only sex-, age-, and background-matched mice were used as controls. Basal lung function and lung structure were comparable among all the mice tested. Mice were housed in accordance with institutional guidelines.",

Mice were anaesthetized with ketamin (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) i.p., tracheostomized and ventilated with a volume control constant flow ventilator (Voltek Enterprises, ON, Canada). A volume recruitment maneuver (VRM) (35 cmH 2 O, 3 sec) was performed to standardize volume history at baseline. After intratracheal instillation of HCl (pH=1.5; 2 ml/kg), followed by a VRM (35 cmH 2 O, 3 seconds), animals were ventilated for 3 hrs (F I O 2 1.0, and PEEP 2.5 cmH 2 O). Saline-treated groups served as controls. Total positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP t ) and plateau pressure (P plat ) were measured at the end of expiratory and inspiratory occlusion, respectively. Elastance was calculated as (P plat -PEEP t ) divided by tidal volume (V T ) every 30 min during the ventilation periods. At the end of the ventilation, left lungs were assessed for lung wet/dry weight ratios or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent biochemical analysis. Right lungs were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin for histological examination. To collect BAL fluid for detection of oxidized phospholipids, we performed three washes of 1ml saline each at the end of the 3 hrs ventilation periods.",

In brief, recipient mice were irradiated with 1200 rads. Bone marrow cells from both femurs and tibias were harvested from donor mice under sterile conditions. 50 million nucleated bone marrow cells were obtained from each donor mouse. Bones were flushed with RPMI (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with 10% FCS (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Bone marrow cells were washed twice and counted using a standard hemocytometer. 1 X 10 6 bone marrow cells in 200 \u00b5l of media were delivered i.v. through the tail vein of each recipient mouse. Recipient mice were housed in a barrier facility (individually ventilated cages, high energy particulate arresting filter-filtered air), under pathogen-free conditions before and after bone marrow transplantation.

Bovine lipid extract surfactant certified for human patient use was obtained from BLES Biochemicals (London, ON, Canada). In vitro oxidation of phospholipids was performed according to previously established conditions and confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Rodriguez Capote et al., 2003) . To avoid variable levels of oxidation, this oxidization process was performed on the entire amount of surfactant required for our studies. The non-oxidized control surfactant PL preparations were from the same production batch as the oxidized material. The purified surfactant PLs we used in our study are certified to be free of LPS and are the material used in patients approved by the FDA. Of note, the endotoxin levels were below the detection limit in both non-oxidized and oxidized surfactant PLs preparations used for our experiments. The in vivo impact of non-oxidized surfactant phospholipids (PLs) and oxidized surfactant PLs was tested in normal, healthy lung as well as salinelavaged lungs to remove surfactant. In both conditions, mice were surgically prepared as described above, and ventilated with a volume control constant flow ventilator (Voltek Enterprises, ON, Canada). Volume recruitment VRM (25 cmH 2 O, 3 sec) was performed and measurements were made at baseline. In the normal condition (healthy lungs), either non-oxidized surfactant PLs (50 mg/kg) or oxidized surfactant PLs (50 mg/kg) were instilled intratracheally, followed by a VRM (35 cmH 2 O, 3 sec). Animals were then ventilated for 3 hrs (F I O 2 1.0, and PEEP 2.5 cmH 2 O). For removal of endogenous surfactant, lungs were lavaged using a 1-ml syringe filled with 37\u00b0C saline (0.15 M NaCl) connected to the endotracheal tube. This procedure was repeated 3 times with 3 min between each lavage followed by a VRM (35 cmH 2 O, 3 seconds). Then, animals were treated with either nonoxidized PLs (50 mg/kg body weight) or oxidized PLs (50 mg/kg body weight) intratracheally, followed by a VRM (35 cmH 2 O, 3 sec), and ventilated for 3 hrs (F I O 2 1.0, and PEEP 2.5 cmH 2 O).",
