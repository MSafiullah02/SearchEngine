And bestatin is also a potent competitive inhibitor (K i = 1.4-4.1 \u00b7 10 )6 M) of APN with antitumor activities and immunomodulating activities. APN inhibitor includes natural inhibitors, such as bestatin, lapstatin, phebestin, curcumin, pasmmaplin A, and betulinic acid ( Figure S1 ) [8] [9] [10] , and synthetic small molecule inhibitors such as peptidomimetics and nonpeptides. Generally speaking, because of low bioavailability, rapid elimination, proteolytic lability, and short duration of action etc, the application of peptides in clinic is limited. Therefore, peptidomimetics or peptide mimics are becoming more and more popular to researchers.",

In non-small cell lung cancer, human pancreatic carcinoma and prostate cancer, the expression of APN/CD13 for patients is associated with a poor prognosis, and APN expression is supposed to be involved in the cancer invasion and metastasis [12] [13] [14] [15] . Therefore, some researchers proposed that APN may be a new prognostic marker for cancer. In the progress of solid tumor, the formation of new blood vessels is of more importance. The new vasculature supplies nutrients and oxygen for tumors [16] . APN also participates in tumor angiogenesis through regulating filopodia formation and endothelial invasion [17] . Meanwhile, APN is present on tumor endothelial cells, but not on existing blood vessels in normal tissues [18] . Through proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix, APN and other proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases contribute to the growth and metastasis of tumors.",

            "text": "Most of the anticancer medicines belong to cell toxicity compound, which inhibit the growth of all cells. These medicines not only exert anticancer effect, but also affect the proliferation of normal cells. Therefore, it cannot avoid side effects. The target of our compound is aminopeptidase N which is involved in the development of some cancers, such as ovarian carcinoma, gastric cancer [23, 37] and is highly expressed on some tumor cells, while some tumor cells still express low level of aminopeptidase N. APN inhibitor cannot inhibit the progress and metastasis of all tumor cells, but it is effective to APN expressing tumor and brings little side effects. Although aminopeptidase N still expresses in the other tissues, compared to the metastasis of cancer, the little side effect is acceptable. Besides its direct role in anticancer, APN inhibitor also enhances radiationinduced apoptosis in cervical cancer [38] . Meanwhile, APN also participates in some other diseases, such as lung fibrosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and glomerulopathies [39] [40] [41] . All of this makes APN as a good therapeutic target. Our therapeutic target protein is APN, and the compound should only inhibit the growth of APNexpressing cells. The MTT assay indicated that the compound could affect the viability of tumor cells. It could not confirm the relationship between the compound and APN. Then, the enzyme activity assay was performed. One interesting phenomenon was the compound 13d could effectively inhibit the viability of tumor cells, but it could not equally affect the enzyme activity of APN. Psammaplin A, a marine natural product, inhibits aminopeptidase N and may have other cellular targets [10] . Therefore, we hypothesized 13d may also have other targets affecting the viability of tumor cells. These need further research. However, 13f and 22f could greatly inhibit the viability of HL-60 cells which express high level of APN (Table I and Figure 1 ). And it did not markedly affect the viability of K562 cell line which expresses very low level of APN (Figures 1 and 2b) . These data indicated that the tested compounds were APN hit compounds.",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N plays an important role in angiogenesis and tumor invasion [23, 34] , which is important for the metastasis of cancer. Although the mechanism is unclear, APN is a crucial mediator of galectin-3-induced angiogenesis in endothelial cells [42] . Then, the tube formation and invasion assay were performed. All the tested compounds could markedly inhibit the angiogenesis and the invasion of tumor cells. As we all know, the capillary vessel formation in the tumor tissue provides the tumor cells an opportunity to get into the vasculature system. Before they get into the circulation system, the degradation of extra cellular matrix is required. From these two aspects, the tested compounds can affect the metastasis of primary tumor. Considering its inhibition on the viability of tumor cells, the tested compounds might have notably therapeutic effect to highly metastatic cancer. Contour maps were produced to envision the information content of the derived 3D-QSAR CoMFA model. For the CoMFA steric contour map, green contour plots (G1 and G2 in Figure 6 ) indicate regions where bulky groups are related with increased bioactivity, while yellow contour plots (Y1 in Figure 6 ) indicate regions where such bulky groups are not favoring bioactivity. For example, the compound 7R has a trimethoxybenzamido group located in the G1 region and 13d has an isobutyl group in G2. Compounds 4b and 6c possess an ethyl ester group in the Y1 region, which might be the cause of their low potency. For the CoMFA electrostatic contour map, the red-colored contours (R1 in Figure 6 ) indicate regions in which the presence of the negative charge increases activity, while blue-colored contours (B1 and B2 in Figure 6 ) show regions where the positive charged group is favored. For example, the compounds 22f and 11f have amino groups in B1 and B2 regions. Compounds 22i and 22d got good potency might caused by their hydroxyl group in the R1 region. Based on the observations of the CoMFA contour maps, some useful information could be concluded which were conductive to the next generation of compound synthesis. Take 13f for example, the further optimization should be link electropositive substituent group to the benzene ring, for the CoMFA steric contour map implies large binding pocket around this region, and the CoMFA electrostatic contour suggesting this region may be electrical positively favored. In the other end of 13f, the CoMFA steric contour map indicating the hydroximic acid should be replaced by smaller zinc-binding groups, such as thiol group.",

Early study indicated that a high value of q 2 alone is an insufficient criterion for a QSAR model to be highly predictive. Tropsha and coworkers have introduced a new set of validation criteria for QSAR or QSPR models, and those criteria were accepted and have been applied by other researchers [43] [44] [45] .
