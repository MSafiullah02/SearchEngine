Data on the association between lung development and respiratory symptoms9 in early childhood are mostly derived from small hospital-based studies. Larger epidemiological studies have been based on questionnaires and most studies have been conducted in older children,2 in high-risk populations10 or retrospectively.11 There is a lack of prospectively assessed lung function studies in unselected healthy infants that take into account genetic and environmental factors. However, in order to disentangle the complex interaction of these predisposing factors on lung development and childhood wheeze, relatively large groups of infants need to be studied, with repeated lung function measurements, assessment of environmental and hereditary factors and clinical outcomes. The \u2018Bern Infant Lung Development\u2019 (BILD) cohort aims to contribute towards closing this gap. It was set up in 1999 to study physiological properties of the respiratory system and environmental and genetic risk factors affecting lung development in healthy individuals from infancy through childhood in relation to wheeze.9",

Although the main reason for non-participation was lacking information about the study, participants are likely to be biased towards a well-educated middle-class population. This is the case with most studies involving detailed measurements. In our analyses, social class has so far neither been a risk factor nor a risk modifier for outcome measures. Therefore, although we believe that most results are fairly representative for the general population, it must be kept in mind that not all findings can be extrapolated to all Swiss or European children. Replication of the findings in independent cohorts is desirable.",

We propose a direct effect of these exposures on lung development, and an indirect effect via changes in the balance between inflammation, injury and repair mechanisms, leading to remodelling.
