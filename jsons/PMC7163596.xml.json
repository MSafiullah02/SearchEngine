Diverse ecosystems are present in these zones, including beaches, dunes, and wetlands such as reefs, mangroves, floodplain forests, coastal lagoons, estuaries, and herbaceous wetlands (e.g., tulares, carrizales, and popales). Evidence of the dynamic nature of coastal zones includes erosion processes, which affect beaches and dunes, and meteorological phenomena, such as hurricanes and torrential rainfall, which affect extensive coastal areas. Additionally, coastal zones serve as discharge areas for groundwater and surface water originating from the continent. However, coastal regions are also vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels and phreatic levels as well as the marine intrusion and/or soil salinization (Spalding et al., 2014). These factors can lead to the loss and/or migration of wetlands, habitat fragmentation, and the reduction or ecosystem services loss (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014; Nicholls & Cazenave, 2010).",

As transitional ecosystems between terrestrial and aquatic environments (Mitsch & Gosselink, 2015), wetlands are strongly influenced by hydrology (Gusyev & Haitjema, 2011). Additionally, wetlands are often located in discharge areas and therefore have an important contribution of groundwater (Winter, 1999), which is crucial for nutrient transport and for wetland salinity (Jolly et al., 2008). Both of them (nutrient and salinity) and water have ecological effects, influencing the presence or type of vegetation that establishes, for example (Morris, 1995). Finally, in coastal wetlands, all these factors should consider interactions with both groundwater and marine water too (Qu et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Traditionally, ecological studies in wetlands have been carried out to characterize vegetation composition, biodiversity, water quality, and its effects on wetlands dynamics. Water studies in wetlands tend to be limited to surface water (Kors et al., 2012) and, occasionally, to interstitial water (water present at the root level, Weterbach et al., 2016), without understanding the role of groundwater in wetlands, its chemical composition, or the hydrogeochemical processes influencing these ecosystems (Hunt, Krabbenhoft, & Anderson, 1997; Liu & Mou, 2016). With respect to hydrogeochemical studies in coastal areas, this have been carried out to understand the water quality of aquifers for human use (Chidambaram et al., 2018; Lee & Song, 2007) and, more recently, to identify the causes of salinization (salt intrusion, geological processes, or anthropic contamination, B\u00f6hlke & Denver, 1995; Lee & Song, 2007; Bouzurra, Bouhlila, Elango, Slama, & Ouslati, 2017). Some hydrogeochemical studies have been focused to understand dynamics between groundwater and surface water to reduce anthropic effects but without an ecological approximation (Ladouche & Weng, 2005). Liu and Mou (2016) described some interactions between groundwater\u2013surface water and wetlands and the necessity of a new approach to study this ecosystem. Few hydrogeochemical studies have been carried out in tropical coastal wetlands, so the hydrogeology of these ecosystems is largely unknown, including the origin and evolution of the water that feeds them (Hunt et al., 1997; Carol, Mas\u2010Pla, & Kruse, 2013). In a temperate climate (Scotland), Malcolm and Soulsby (2001) performed the hydrogeochemical characterization of a coastal aquifer associated with an interdunal wetland complex to understand its biodiversity and its capacity to maintain the quality of fresh water despite its location and land\u2010use change. House and Sorensen (2015) characterized a riparian wetland in the United Kingdom using a model that incorporated temperature and botanical indicators (hydrophytes species present in sampling sites) in order to determine the dynamics between groundwater and surface water. In Latinamerica, Carol et al. (2013) characterized the wetlands in the Bay of Samboronb\u00f3n, Argentina, with the objective of establishing criteria for the conservation of their water resources, and Yetter (2004) characterized the hydrogeochemistry, the origin, and the quantity of water that is feeding mangroves and herbaceous wetlands in the Ramsar Site La Mancha in Mexico.",

Over this latter unit, the undifferentiated Tamaulipas Formation was deposited during the Middle Cretaceous. It is composed of lime mudstone and wackestone with some intercalations of shale and loam, with a thickness of 400 m (Stephenson, 1922). The Agua Nueva Formation of the Upper Cretaceous covers this latter unit. It is formed by lime mudstone and wackestone with intercalations of shale, with a thickness of 127 m (Stephenson, 1922). Over this latter formation, the M\u00e9ndez Formation from the Upper Cretaceous is found. It is composed of shale and loam alternated with bentonitic shale, with a varying thickness of 100 to 1,000 m (Jeffreys, 1910). The Cretaceous formations are covered by the Chicontepec Formation of the Tertiary period. It is constituted by an alternation of clay sandstone with siltstone, sandy loam, and grey shale, with a varying thickness of 1,500 to 3,300 m (Dumble, 1918). Additional geological units composed of clay\u2013sand materials cover the Chicontepec Formation (Figure 3). The sediments in the coastal plain in the Gulf of Mexico are composed of clays of which Cruz\u2010Orozco, Machado Navarro, Alba Cornejo, and T\u00e9llez Ort\u00edz (1987) identified: montmorillonite 32% to 50%, illite from 20% to 34%, kaolinite from 19% to 34%, and chlorite with the lowest values from 10% to 29%. According to vegetation, Campos et al. (2011) detailed major soil properties by depth in different vegetation communities from Ci\u00e9naga del Fuerte (Table 1). The volcanic rocks that have been reported in the region correspond to rhyolites with quartz, potassium feldspar, oligoclase, biotite, amphibole, and pyroxene, as well as dacites with plagioclase (oligoclase, albite) with a higher content of potassium and amphiboles (SGM, 2004).",

            "text": "With respect to the hydrogeological functioning (Figure 4), the recharge area of the WSM experiences high rainfall and humidity, favouring the infiltration of water. Once water infiltrates, it flows towards regions of lower hydraulic head according to Darcy's law or, in this case, towards the Gulf of Mexico. Along this route, groundwater interacts with different geological materials and becomes enriched with ions, resulting in the modification of its hydrogeochemical signature until its capture and/or arrival at the discharge area. Because of the stratification of the region, multiple sedimentary units of low hydraulic conductivity are present. Water contained in the sedimentary units of the Cretaceous period is confined to aquifers and can only ascend to the surface or mix with more local flows through faults or fractures (Figure 4). Ci\u00e9naga del Fuerte is located near the coast, in the discharge zone, within a regional hydrogeological system. In this context, the recharge occurs mainly in the limestone of the mountainous area in the Sierra Madre Oriental. These sedimentary rocks are covered by other less permeable clay formations, giving it the character of a confined aquifers. On the other hand, on the Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, there are volcanic rocks with a certain permeability that collect the local recharge along the Gulf Slope.",

Also, it has lower ion concentrations, which create more favourable conditions for most species. This site experienced disturbance 20 years ago and is therefore regenerating and is subjected to the constant perturbation by grazing cattle. On the other hand, the Cladium\u2010Typha\u2010Cyperus site had the highest level of flooding of all sites, even in the dry season. Its dominant species was C. jamaicense, even though T. domingensis is reportedly one of the most tolerant species to flooding in terms of flood depth (Chen & Vaughan, 2014) and time exposed to flooding (Cronk & Fennessy, 2001) because it possesses several mechanisms that enable it to tolerate prolonged periods of flooding (Armstrong, Justin, Beckett, & Lythe, 1991; Colmer, 2003; Cronk & Fennessy, 2001; Voesenek & Bailey\u2010Serres, 2015). Interestingly, these adaptions can signify that low levels of flooding (\u221210 cm) are stressful for this species (unpublished results). Meanwhile, C. jamaicense is reportedly more sensitive to flooding (Newman, Grace, & Koebel, 1996) and to water with high phosphorus concentrations. For these reasons, it was displaced by T. domingensis in the Everglades as this environment transformed from oligotrophic to eutrophic (Davis, 1991). In the present study, the dominance of C. jamaicense in the most flooded site may be due to its higher sensitivity to other factors that are not present as the major ion concentration. Accordingly, C. jamaicense may take advantage of this opportunity niche despite the flood level favouring T. domingensis. Species present in Group 1 can be considered more generalist and are fed with water characteristics of rainwater and inhabit environments that are favourable for the establishment of a greater number of species and/or environments that may be considered oligotrophic.",

Meanwhile, T. domingensis was present under saturated conditions, which complies with its basic requirements (nonstress conditions) although is more specialized to major floods (Inoue & Tsuchiya, 2006; unpublished results), and it likely dominates the Typha\u2010Cladium sites because of its greater tolerance to the higher ion concentrations in regional discharge compared with C. jamaicense. Overall, greater plasticity is observed in the Group 2 species, which are mainly represented by T. geniculata and T. domingensis. These latter species occupy more specialized habitats compared with the Group 1 species (considered more generalist).",

In fact, the area outlying the PNA is part of the most important region for the production of Valencian orange in the country (Sistema de Informaci\u00f3n Agroalimentaria y Pesquera, 2018). Accordingly, a large portion of the water samples were taken near the zone of saltwater intrusion and/or irrigation return, especially those in Group 2, so if salinization is due to irrigation return, strategies targeting the sustainable development and management of agriculture should be implemented to maintain the quantity and quality of water inflow (whether local or regional in origin) in Ci\u00e9naga del Fuerte. If salinization is due to salt intrusion, then it is even more important to maintain the quality and quantity of local and regional flows to minimize or stop it. Further studies are necessary to distinguish which of these latter two processes is most influential for the water chemistry of the PNA.",

            "text": "\nThe Ci\u00e9naga del Fuerte PNA is located in a regional discharge area and, based on the Mifflin hydrogeochemical diagram, it is mainly fed by local and regional flows.Two groups of groundwater were identified in the Gibbs diagram. Group 1 was associated with the floodplain pasture and Cladium\u2010Typha\u2010Cyperus sites, and Group 2 was associated with the Thalia and Typha\u2010Cladium sites. The Group 1 samples had characteristics similar to those of local recharge or rainwater, whereas the Group 2 samples appeared to be more evolved or originate from regional flows.The groundwater of Ci\u00e9naga del Fuerte was more influenced by silicate alteration than by carbonate dissolution.The chemical signatures of the groundwater of Ci\u00e9naga del Fuerte were influenced by interaction with the rocks through which groundwater circulated. Spatiotemporally, the characteristics of the Group 1 samples are more similar to those of local recharge, whereas those of the Group 2 samples evidence the occurrence of water\u2013rock interaction and evaporation.The spatiotemporal behaviour of the water samples shows that groundwater underwent evapotranspiration, possibly as a result of saltwater intrusion and/or irrigation return from agricultural activities.Groundwater in Ci\u00e9naga del Fuerte first undergoes processes of ion exchange and, as it evolves, evapotranspiration occurs. This is congruent with the region's climate and the clay content in wetland soil.The residual alkalinity showed that, as groundwater begins to evolve, spatiotemporal variation is near zero. However, in the rainy season, the Group 2 samples had positive residual alkalinity, which then turned negative in the dry season. This indicates that the hydrophytic communities associated with Group 2 likely exhibit plasticity to variation in the chemical components of water. The hydrophytic communities associated with Group 1 are more restricted in their habitat to sites with lower salt concentration.The chemical composition of groundwater in Ci\u00e9naga del Fuerte creates unique conditions that determine the areas or habitats occupied by hydrophytic species.The spatiotemporal behaviour of groundwater chemistry is one factor that, along with the hydroperiod, determines the dynamics and functioning of wetlands (eco\u2010hydrogeoperiod).The characterization and spatiotemporal behaviour of the hydrogeochemistry of wetlands are critical for understanding the origin of water feeding wetlands and the interaction between different water flows and wetland ecosystems and their dynamics. Ultimately, this information will provide a better understanding of the influence of water chemistry on the ecology of wetlands, over their floristic composition and to propose management plans including discharges areas (wetland zones) and recharges areas (upstream).\n",
