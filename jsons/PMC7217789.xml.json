            "text": "Severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since rapidly spread across the world, causing a global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The majority of cases are mild to moderate, but severe infections have overwhelmed healthcare systems in the United States, particularly in New York City. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of viral RNA from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs has become the standard method used to confirm diagnosis. The first quantitative RT-PCR test for detecting SARS-CoV2 was designed and distributed in January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) (1). In the United States and many other countries, however, the slow rollout of large-scale diagnostic testing and the long turnaround times associated with laboratory tests, particularly those sent to reference laboratories, have significantly hampered public health efforts to contain the outbreak.",

Beginning in March 2020, multiple SARS-CoV-2 rapid tests received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, manufacturer submissions for EUA only require evaluation of the limit of detection and cross-reactivity of their assays, and do not address other important performance characteristics such as accuracy, precision, and reproducibility. In addition, most manufacturer submissions include studies of contrived positive samples with spiked viral RNA, and do not assess performance on clinical patient specimens. Two recently-authorized rapid tests, Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and ID Now SARS-CoV-2 (Abbott, Chicago, IL) have been manufactured at wide-scale and distributed to numerous medical centers around the country. While initial studies on these two assays have been recently published, the number of patient samples evaluated to date has been relatively small, and significant questions remain about the accuracy of these tests across the full spectrum of viral loads ([2], [3], [4], [5]). Utilizing the high volume of patient testing performed at our medical center in New York City, we sought to evaluate and compare the performance of these two rapid assays across a wide range of clinical samples.",

There were also two samples that tested negative by cobas but positive by the Xpert. These samples had Ct values >40 for the N2 target only without detection of the E-gene target.

In contrast, the ID Now assay reliably detected specimens with Ct values \u226430, but did not detect the majority of specimens with Ct values \u2265 30. Whereas Rhoades et al. (3) found an overall high level of agreement between ID Now and the modified CDC assay, Hogan et al. (5) demonstrated lower agreement between ID Now and Panther Fusion (Hologic, Inc., Marlborough, MA). Our findings further highlight an important limitation of the ID Now for low-level positives. While all studies evaluated nasopharyngeal swabs eluted in transport media, it is important to note that the EUA for ID NOW was recently updated to remove the indication for swabs in transport media (6). Our data support that the EUA was appropriately modified, as samples may become too dilute in VTM and low-level positives may falsely test negative.",

However, the two assays differ in throughput capacity and run time. Each ID Now platform can run only a single specimen at a time, with results available in 13 minutes or less. Xpert can be run on larger, random-access platforms that allow for significantly higher throughput, with results available in 45 minutes. Both assays are available for use in POC settings, which introduces both benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, POC molecular testing delivers the shortest possible interval between sample collection and result, which can facilitate faster clinical decision-making. However, concerns related to assay performance, quality management, and safety in the POC setting still remain. Studies of POC molecular testing for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus have shown promising results, but also highlight some of these concerns ([7], [8], [9], [10]). The risk of contamination and false positives is also much higher when testing is performed outside of a controlled environment and by non-laboratory trained personnel. Nevertheless, the unique circumstances of a rapidly-spreading pandemic may ultimately necessitate the widescale adoption of POC assays in completely new patient settings, such as walk up or drive-thru testing centers.",
