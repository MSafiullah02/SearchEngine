Decentralized government efforts to reduce spread, combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the U.S. a challenge. We generate a novel metric to represent social distancing behavior derived from mobile phone data and examine its relationship with COVID-19 case reports at the county level. Our analysis reveals that social distancing is strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the 25 most affected counties in the United States, with a lag period consistent with the incubation time of SARS-CoV-2. We also demonstrate evidence that social distancing was already under way in many U.S. counties before state or local-level policies were implemented. This study strongly supports social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the United States.",

(2020) found evidence that social distancing measures in cities throughout China, delayed case transmission (8) . Chinazzi et al. 2020 (9) used a transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the spread of COVID-19 in China, finding travel restrictions to the affected areas to have modest effects and that transmission reduction interventions are more effective at mitigating the pandemic. These studies are encouraging and suggest social distancing measures should successfully mitigate infection transmission outside of China, however this has yet to be shown. There are qualitative studies and projections for social distancing helping to reduce the spread of COVID in countries such as Italy (10) and the US (11) but, to date, no such quantitative analysis has been conducted outside of China. We therefore extend the current body of work to evaluate the impact of social distancing on the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, the country which has reported the most confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in the world.",

To compute this measure, we use daily origindestination (OD) trip matrices at the U.S. county level derived from mobile phone records obtained from Teralytics (12) . This effort aligns with a recent Letter in Science (13) supporting the use of aggregated mobility data to monitor the effectiveness of social distancing interventions. The data provided consists of the number of unique daily trips made between all pairs of US counties, each day, from January 1 through April 20, 2020. Specifically, SD is the sum of the total trips incoming, outgoing and within each county on a given day, divided by the same measure on a baseline day. The baseline value is specific to each day of the week and taken as the average over the last three weeks in January 2020, when travel patterns were stable (see Fig. S3 ). We interpret this metric as a proxy for social distancing based on the assumption that when individuals make fewer trips, they physically interact less. Formally, is calculated as follows:",

This metric accounts for movements both between and within counties, thus includes changes in typical commuting patterns as well as micro-level (within county) movements, (e.g., travel to local grocery stores, shopping centers, gyms, schools, etc.) Using this function, an SD of zero would indicate no trips were made, while a value of 0.5 indicates half the number of trips relative to the baseline were made on a given day. An SD of one signifies no change in behavior since the advent of COVID-19 in the US, and any value above one means that mobility has actually increased from the baseline. The differences in county-level SD across the U.S. from January 24 to April 17, 2020, are illustrated in Fig. 1 and shown at a daily resolution in the Animation S1. For the 25 U.S. counties with the highest number of reported cases, the SD as of April 17 are shown in Fig. S4 , with the 25 counties ranked accordingly. The SD for these 25 counties ranges from 0.35 in New York City, to 0.63 in Harris County, Texas, which illustrates varying SD measures and associated behavioral change in place. Counties illustrating the most social distancing in the first week of April are predominantly in New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, the locations reporting the most COVID-19 cases to date.

Fig. S6 provides the complete list of all U.S. states ranked by their respective SD ratios as of April 17. Consistent with county level behavior, there is evidence of different social distancing across states, with only D.C. reducing trips below 50%, and the rest of the 50 states moving around between 53% to 90% traditional levels. Many of the southern states, which implemented temporary closure of non-essential business later in March or early April, report higher SD ratios. Fig. 2 illustrates the state SD trends over time, in relation to the introduction of each state's social distancing directive, which are noted by the red dashed vertical lines (explicit dates are listed in Table S1 ). In addition to the timing of the state-level directives, we collected information on the county level social distancing directives that were implemented in each of the 25 counties of focus. The timing of the local-level directives relative to SD behavior at the state level are also illustrated in Fig 2, as the blue dashed lines. A list of all local directives and respective dates is provided in Table S3 and includes the time gap between local and state-level actions. Fig 2 illustrates that social distancing began to occur in early March, well before the first U.S. state (California), implemented a \"stay at home\" directive, on March 19. The county level directives partially explain the earlier decline in SD, which is observed to begin well before the state-level directives where put in place, however all states illustrate some level of social distancing even before county level directives were enacted. Fig.  S7 and S8 further illustrate the relationship between state and local directives and social distancing ratio (SD) for each of the selected 25 counties based on total (S7) and internal/localonly (S8) trips, respectively. From this county level break down it is evident that locations such Bergen, NJ, Oakland, MI, Orange, NY and Fairfield, CN implemented local-level directives much earlier than their corresponding states, which align with the start of social distancing decline in these counties. In contrast, in Orleans and Jefferson, LA where local level directives were implemented late or not at all, social distancing was declining for weeks without directives in place, suggesting other motivations drove this behavioral change within the region. For all 25 counties, except for Jefferson, LA, local directives were implemented at least three to 17 days prior to the state level stay-at-home directives, with an average difference of 7.3 days.",

We fit a linear regression model for each county, specifically using lagged SD as a predictor of COVID-19 growth rate and test the correlation of SD and GR at different time lags. From these results, the correlation between the SD and GR is computed for each county. Additionally, the most highly correlated lag range is identified based on the (maximum) mean and (minimum) standard deviation of the correlations across all counties, based on Pearson correlation coefficient.

In other words, the lag time that best links social distancing and case growth rate in our analysis reflects the time it takes for symptoms to manifest after infection, worsen, and be reported. The confidence intervals shown on the curve illustrate that this estimated lag interval is robust and consistent across multiple counties. During the same period, the social distancing ratio steadily decreases, specifically during the second half of March, before stabilizing for most locations in early April, followed by a slight increase throughout April.",

The exact motivation behind the individual-level behavioral changes requires further study but could possibly be attributed to media and information sharing, which itself varies substantially by information source, location, and time. The growth rate ratio shows a general decreasing trend for all locations through March, stabilizing around one in April, which is consistent with the case curves. All correlations are found to be significant at a 95% confidence level, with the correlations for many of the top 25 counties above 80%. These high correlations suggest that social distancing has had a significant effect on the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. Some exceptions include Orleans, LA (.61) and Harris County, TX (.53), the former of which can be attributed to an outbreak which took off before social distancing was common practice, while the case counts in Harris, TX are likely underestimated due to limited testing rates in Texas. We repeated the equivalent evaluation method at the state level, using aggregated case reports from all the counties within each state. The results are consistent with the county-level analysis, revealing a 9-12-day lag window (Fig. S9) , and displaying similarly high correlations between social distancing and growth rate (Fig. S10) . The lowest correlation, 0.69, is observed for Massachusetts, which is likely a result of intra-state noise in the data and spatial variability, specifically with regards to the state of the outbreak, testing capabilities, and varied degrees of behavioral change associated with social distancing measures.",

Nevertheless, our methodology captures relevant trends in human behavior as it relates to the spread of the disease. Because our analysis uses real-time mobility data at the individual level, we capture the dynamics of social distancing without relying on assumed efficacy of shelter-in-place orders. Additionally, we use the real-world frequency of trips, not extrapolated transmission rates or travel distances, as our mobility indicator.

Importantly, our statistical analysis reveals that the effect of social distancing on decreasing transmission is not perceptible for nine to twelve days after implementation. Besides emphasizing its necessity, this study also reveals that social distancing (and outbreak growth deceleration) in the counties most affected by COVID was driven primarily by local-level regulations and changes in individual-level behavior; the state (and federal) actions implemented were done so either too late (or not at all). This is an important insight, as it demonstrates (given the clear correlation we present between social distancing and case growth), that it is within the power of each U.S. resident, even without government mandates, to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Critically, if individual-level and local actions were not taken, and social distancing behavior was delayed until the state-level directives were first implemented, COVID-19 would have been able to circulate unmitigated for additional weeks in most locations, inevitably resulting in more infections and lives lost. Further, the strong relationship between social distancing and outbreak case growth rates suggest that a return to 'normal' interaction patterns will result in an increase in case growth rates, which may appear 9-12 days after behavioral changes ensue. However, under these changes, additional precautions such as hand washing, wearing masks and self-isolation when sick may help to lessen the case growth rates.",

First, we focus on quantifying the relationship between social distancing and case growth rates, therefore the role of other potential mitigating factors (e.g., wearing masks, hand washing, etc.) that could also have contributed to the decline in the case growth rate observed during March are not accounted for. Second, we use the growth rate ratio (GR) as our representative variable for the degree of transmission occurring in a region. We believe this is an intuitive and representative estimate for the spread of COVID-19 amongst a local population, but future extensions of this analysis can explore replacing this variable with more traditional transmission indexes commonly used in infectious disease epidemiology. Third, the case data is error prone due to both reporting issues and limited testing capacity, especially in early March before widespread testing was underway. We partially address this issue by using a 3-day moving average for the case data. Forth, the analysis is focused on 25 counties which may represent a biased sample of locations; however, the same results are shown to hold when extrapolated up to the state level, which lends additional confidence to the conclusions. Last, the data used in this analysis does not differentiate amongst sociodemographic groups, and therefore may not representatively capture all groups such as the elderly, low income families and underrepresentative minorities, for whom social distancing may not be an option, or may not have cell phones.",

It may be difficult to recognize the value in safe behavior when the reward is not obvious, and the danger is not immediate.

Nevertheless, given the lack of proven antiviral drugs or a vaccine, social distancing is the most important and timely way to combat the spread of COVID-19 (17, 18) . These findings also highlight the difference in pandemic control policy between the U.S. and China and should serve to support more timely policymaking in the U.S. moving forward. This is particularly relevant as the U.S. begins to loosen stay at home orders, once again doing so in a highly decentralized manner. We hope that our results will motivate both individuals and decision makers in the US to take seriously the importance of advocating for safe and data-driven policy in the face of this pandemic, while balancing its impact on associated communities.
