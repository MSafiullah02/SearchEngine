            "text": "In recent years, air pollution has attracted increasing attention globally as it significantly impacted global health (Gheorghe & Ion, 2011; Yuan, Zhang, Wang, Wang, & Zuo, 2017). Worldwide air pollution-related mortality was estimated at around 6.5 million in 2012 (Influenza-like illness concept, 2014). In Taiwan, urbanization and the rapid development of various industries have made air pollution an critical concern. Obtaining real-time air quality information is of great importance for air pollution prevention. Thus, it is necessary to perform air pollution analysis and prediction to determine changing trends in air pollution and to propose prevention strategies. However, since the collected air pollution data is not only dynamically evolving and vast, a lot of computation resources are needed. In addition, it is difficult to analyze the data effectively and reliably in stand-alone computation environments. Therefore, an integrated platform of air pollution monitoring was constructed by using Spark (Spark yarn, 2016; Geng & Zhang, 2017; Yang, Chan, Liu, & Lou, 2017; Yang, Chen, Den, Wang, & Kristiani, 2018), R (Liu et al., 2018) and ELK Stack (LangiWidyawan et al., 2015, pp. 181\u2013186; Prakash, Kakkar, & Patel, 2016) based on Hadoop framework to provide a real-time and easy-to-use big data analysis and visualization environment. In this work, the real-time data of air pollution and influenza-like illness were collected from the open data websites provided by the environmental protection administration and the Taiwan CDC open data portal, respectively. In addition, HDFS and Alluxio software were employed to build the cloud storage framework. The Ceph object storage environment was also developed as the backup storage framework. Through the dashboard created by ELK Stack software, users could quickly realize the association analyses between air pollution and influenza-like illness in Taiwan in a visualized way.",

Health workers collected nose and throat swabs for virus detection by multiplex real-time RT-PCR. ILI was detected at least once in 219 (23.7%) of 945 household members. 271 (62.3%) of 435 nose/throat swabs were positive for at least one of the 15 viruses tested. Six viruses predominated amongst positive swabs: Rhinovirus (28%), Influenza virus (17%), Coronavirus (8%), Enterovirus (5%), Respiratory syncytial virus (3%), Metapneumovirus virus (2.5%) and Parainfluenza virus 3 (1.8%). There was no clear seasonality, but 78% of episodes occurred in Winter/Spring for Influenza compared to 32% for Rhinovirus. Participants, on average, suffered 0.49 ILI, and 0.29 virus-positive ILI episodes, with no significant effects of gender, age, or household size. In contrast to the US and Australian community studies, the frequency of ILI decreased as the number of household members aged below five years increased (p = 0.006). The findings indicate the need for tailored ILI control strategies, and for a better understanding of how local childcare practices and seasonality may influence transmission and the role of children.",

Our work provides a real-time gathering of data set and a social event. The results demonstrate an association of multi-factor air pollution and influenza cases, which is the combined effect of several mechanisms. First, high air pollution has been proved to harm both innate and cell-mediated immunity. It may take a period to develop symptoms and signs of influenza after the insults. Second, air pollution is associated with the abundance of microorganisms. The size of influenza virus about 0.08\u20130.12 \u03bcm is smaller than the PM2.5 so that airborne pollution particles provide condensation nuclei to which virus droplets attach. The effect of incubation period could play a role in the lag-time effect. In the incubation period is 5\u20137 days in the cases of influenza, so the lag-effect cannot be explained by organisms inoculation alone. Population susceptibility and immunogenically modulated by genetic factor and environment stimuli would be possible underlying mechanisms in the phenomena.
