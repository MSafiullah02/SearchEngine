However, certain types of coronaviruses can affect the lower airway, causing serious illnesses such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Coronaviruses have very large single stranded RNA genomes (approximately 26-32 KB). Coronavirus particles are surrounded by a fatty outer layer called an \u201cenvelope\u201d and usually are spherical when visualised under an electron microscope, with a \u201ccorona\u201d of club-shaped spikes on their surface (\nWu\net al., 2020). Most people become infected with coronaviruses at some point in their lives, but the majority of these are harmless. The novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 illness, is different, and can be extremely serious.",

            "text": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is known as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2). It appears to have emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The viruses first inhabited animals such as bats and then \u201cjumped\u201d to humans: this occurred in China in late 2019, from whence it has spread worldwide (\nZhu\net al., 2020). Coronaviruses replicate their RNA genomes using enzymes called RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which are prone to errors, but genomic analysis to date suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating slowly, thus reducing the chance of it changing to become deadlier (\nWu\net al., 2020). It is worth mentioning that since 2003, viral diseases have caused major pandemics. These include the coronaviruses, which have caused multiple major public health events that resulted in global pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; or \u201cbat SARS\u201d), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (\nKandeel\net al., 2020). In addition, with a growing threat to maternal-foetal health, the Zika viral illness began in 2009 with devastating consequences and continues to spread (\nTowers\net al., 2018). Finally, in some parts of the globe, cases of swine flu (H1N1 virus) are still on the rise\nsuch as in India, where in 2020 alone around 1500 cases have been reported to date, with 28 deaths in the period from 1 January to 1 March 2020.",

The main recognised clinical features of COVID-19 include fever (52% of younger patient, 89% of older patients), cough (44% younger, 77% older; usually dry, but can be expectorant), fatigue or tiredness; more severe cases get pneumonia. In mild cases people may have only a runny nose or sore throat. Patients may also have gastro-intestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhoea and anorexia. It does appear that older people, on the whole, are more severely affected. Individuals with pre-existing co-morbid conditions also appear to be particularly at risk: these illnesses include hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy (\nMao\net al., 2020;\nWan\net al., 2020;\nZhang\net al., 2020a;\nZhang\net al., 2020b;\nZhang\net al., 2020c;\nZheng\net al., 2020a). There is also recent evidence that anosmia or loss of smell is a symptom of COVID-19 and can even be the presenting symptom (\nHopkins & Kumar, 2020;\nL\u00fcers\net al., 2020). Recent unpublished results in a series of 417 patients suggest rates of >80%, and\na large European multicentre trial is currently being undertaken.",

Patients with abnormal chest images are older, with a higher rate of pre-existing conditions, lower rate of exposure history, and a longer time between onset and confirmation than patients without pneumonia. In addition, patients with more severe symptoms have a higher rate of fever, expectorant cough and headache, lower lymphocytes, albumin and serum sodium, and a higher total bilirubin, c-reactive protein, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, (\nZhang\net al., 2020c). Muscle aches, headache, shortness of breath and nausea/vomiting are also associated with disease severity. Also, biomarkers such as lower lymphocyte levels in addition to raised leukocytes, D-dimer levels, procalcitonin and serum creatinine, as well as higher radiograph score at admission are predictive factors for a severe/critical subtype (\nZhang\net al., 2020c). Finally, it has been shown that elevated exhaustion levels and reduced functional diversity of T cells in peripheral blood may predict progression in COVID-19 patients (\nZheng\net al. 2020b). In the most severe cases, patients go into respiratory and multi-organ failure. It must be borne in mind, however, that mortality has also been reported in children, adolescents and young adults. Thus, it does appear that no one is immune or not at risk.",

            "text": "As with anxiety \u2013 since confinement and quarantine are anxiety-triggering in their own right \u2013 an increase in tic severity can be expected. Moreover, behavioural abnormalities will likely also be exacerbated. First comes ADHD, present in 50\u201370% of patients with GTS (\nHirschtritt\net al., 2015). In particular, the hyperactive phenotype makes confinement and quarantine hard to bear as physical energy cannot be released. It is also likely that rage attacks/explosive outbursts, as well as oppositional behaviour \u2013 which largely depend on the presence of comorbid ADHD (\nM\u00fcller-Vahl\net al., 2020) \u2013 will put an increasing strain on families. Reducing screen time \u2013 a frequent trigger of explosive outbursts \u2013 follows a paradoxical injunction similar to hand washing since it is more difficult to enforce in conditions of confinement and quarantine, added to which comes reduced schooling time. Yet, this is a potential conflict for parents as allowing children and adolescents to use screens more abundantly than usual may be the only way to keep the peace for the time being. Nevertheless, even in instances where increased screen time cannot be avoided, it is still possible to ensure that the content of what is being watched is age appropriate, engaging/interactive and meaningful. With regard to ADHD and impulsivity, following the rules (hygiene and social distancing) may be particularly difficult. Note that behavioural abnormalities related to ADHD not only concern children but also adults, especially maladaptive behaviours (\nHaddad\net al., 2009). Home schooling may further penalize children with learning disabilities, frequent in GTS. Lastly, a hallmark of GTS is individual variation. We have also heard from adult patients whose tics are usually worse when they are out in society and less intrusive at home; some have described being in self-isolation with families or alone and finding their tics relatively settled.",

Patients told us of developing new coughing tics, with a particular urge in public. Other examples to be expected in times of COVID-19 may manifest as spitting, sneezing into one\u2019s hands, not maintaining social distancing, or attempting to shake hands (personal observations). Touching other people is not an uncommon complex motor tic but in the \u201cCOVID-19 climate\u201d could also represent NOSIS (see\nTable 1). Note that these behaviours can also fall into the risk-seeking/impulsive phenotype often present in patients with GTS (\nWright\net al., 2012). Furthermore, echolalia and echopraxia may lead patients with GTS to copy other people\u2019s coughing.

Undoubtedly, this literature will grow over the upcoming months and years. As immune function may be altered (even though this does not necessarily mean diminished or compromised) in GTS, one may wonder whether our patients bear a special risk of sequelae. Intuition however dictates that this is highly unlikely as viral CNS infections have a higher probability to target people with neurodegenerative disease, or even causing it, as was the case after the Spanish influenza pandemic and resulting Encephalitis Lethargica (\nHoffman & Vilensky, 2017). In neurodevelopmental disorders such as GTS \u2013 and this also holds true for its comorbidities which are based on circuit dysfunctions \u2013 it is, at present, hard to see how a viral infection, and more specifically SARS-CoV-2, could lead to lasting CNS sequelae specific to GTS (for an evolving online resource, see\nhere).

Similarly, spitting or forced touching etc. can be part of tic-related behaviours that may get the patient in trouble with the law. Hence awareness and appropriate support (e.g. the GTS patient may have to carry a card, informing authorities and other appropriate people about the condition) is important. Further, accurate identification and treatment of tics and comorbidities should continue as usual and according to established guidelines, if possible (\nPringsheim\net al., 2019). It is likely that medications will need to be increased probably transiently until the COVID-19 crisis resolves. That is obviously true for anti-tic medication as it is for psychostimulants (for ADHD) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (for anxiety and OCD). There are currently unprecedented challenges in healthcare delivery and some of the specialists who would normally give this advice in many countries may be unavailable for a time due to redeployment, potentially causing further stress to families. Also, CBT for tics (\nvan de Griendt\net al., 2013) should be maintained by videoconferencing whenever possible (\nAndr\u00e9n\net al., 2019). The same applies to supportive psychotherapy for those who suffer from anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Finally, telehealth will play an increasing role in the medical follow-up of patients with TS, likely beyond the end of the pandemic. It will be important to establish whether this type of care will be well accepted by patients and families alike.",
