This chapter discusses aspiration and bronchial obstruction in detail, with emphasis on the aspiration of toxic, infective, or particulate matter. Lung abscess, a frequent complication of obstruction or aspiration, is also reviewed. Both aspiration and lung abscess are reconsidered within the context of pulmonary infectious disease mainly in Chapter 8 on bacterial infections, and to some extent in the chapters on mycobacterial (Chapter 9), fungal (Chapter 10), and parasitic diseases (Chapter 14) .",

            "text": "Aspiration is the inhalation of liquid or solid materials into the lower respiratory tract, usually from the oral or nasal cavities, oropharynx, esophagus, or stomach. Logically, the course of aspiration is determined by such laws of physics as inertia and gravity. Larger, more solid materials, and finer more liquid materials, all follow the straightest and most dependent course after they enter the trachea. As explained in Chapter 2, the right mainstem bronchus continues on a more direct course than the left (20 to 30 degrees compared to 40 to 60 degrees for the left mainstem bronchus); the wider angle of the left bronchus allows it to extend around the heart. Larger, more solid objects that pass the larynx often lodge in the right mainstem bronchus, while smaller solid objects most frequently continue into the right lower lobe bronchus. 2 This has been well demonstrated in the aspiration of foreign objects by children, generally in the age group of 1 to 3 years. 3 ,4 During this age range, children examine almost everything by placing items into their mouths. In both children and adults, larger objects are sometimes stopped at the larynx and may be expelled by strong coughing. In adults, sudden death due to laryngeal obstruction by aspirated food (most frequently meat) has been termed the cafe coronary.s More than 80% of aspirated foreign bodies occur in children, and among all age groups only 5% are spontaneously expectorated. 6 ,7 Sharper objects may perforate a bronchus and cause bleeding, or even penetrate the pleural cavity and cause pneumothorax. 8 A foreign body may migrate within the bronchi and cause wandering infiltra tes. 9 Young children most frequently aspirate peanuts, beads, and other fragments of wooden or plastic toys. Peanuts and sunflower seeds lead the list in Western countries, whereas in Arabic countries children most often aspirate melon seeds. 8 Older children may inhale flowering grass fragments, which wedge themselves into more distal bronchi and resist expectoration. In any age group, teeth, fragments of bone ( Fig. 5.1) , food, blood clots, tissue fragments, nasal pack components, lipids from oily nose drops or orally administered cathartics, bacterial fragments, and gastric content most commonly enter the lung. Noguchi et a1. 10 reported a subacute reaction to mud aspiration in a victim of near-drowning, while aspiration of sand in children has been reported to cause a radiographic \"sand bronchogram.,, 11 Drowning, often thought of as occurring in fresh or salt water, has also occurred in large vats of beer, wine, liquid chocolate, and other interesting concoctions. A literary example of this is Shakespeare's Richard III, in which the Duke of Clarence is finally dispatched in a large vat of wine (the \"malmsey butt,,). 12 Brock 13 .1 4 in 1942, beautifully illustrated the mechanics of aspiration with abscess formation, which most often followed the dependent course described. Once within the lung, finer and more fluid ingredients flow into the first dependent orifices that are encountered. In the supine position, these are most often the posterior segment of the upper lobe and superior segment of the lower lobe ( Fig. 5.2 ). In the more upright position, material flows preferentially into the basilar segments of the lower lobes. The basilar segments divide rather evenly, and localization within these segments is not as discrete as in other areas of the lung. When a person is in the lateral decubitus position, the axillary branches of the subsegments of apical and posterior upper lobe bronchi are favored. The more anterior portions of the lung are usually spared the effects of aspiration, unless aspiration occurs in the prone position, as in near-drowning.",

            "text": "The most common conditions predisposing to aspiration include impaired consciousness, most frequently from alcohol, drugs, or anesthesia, followed by central nervous system disorders (e.g., epilepsy, stroke, dementia) or neuromuscular diseases. 4 Next in frequency is aspiration secondary to obstructing masses or other functional defects of the esophagus or stomach. Episodes of aspiration are eventually confirmed in about 85% of children, but in only about 30% of adults. 3 ,ls The difference in documentation is probably related to the altered level of consciousness in adults causing temporary amnesia. The common clinical manifestations of an aspirated foreign body constitute a triad of cough, wheezing or rhonchi, and decreased air entry. 3 The wheezing that is sometimes associated with aspirated foreign bodies in children may be ameliorated with theophylline, leading to diagnostic confusion with asthma. 16 Early experimental animal studies showed that aspiration of material into the lungs regularly occurs when materials are placed in the nares or accessory sinuses during anesthesia. 17 ,18 Myerson 19 found blood immediately postoperatively in the tracheobronchial tree in 79% to 100% of humans who underwent tonsillectomy, including those under general or local anesthesia. Several experimental studies have also proven that normal adults aspirate with some regularity. Quinn and Meyer20 in 1929 introduced lipiodal (iodinated poppy seed oil) into the noses of sleeping subjects and found the material often entered the lungs. Amberson 21 in 1937 reported placing barium in the mouths of normal subjects during sleep, with similar results. Radiologists sometimes observe aspiration while performing upper gastrointestinal tract barium studies (see below). As reviewed by Bartlett, 22 various markers placed in the stomach the night prior to surgery have been identified in lungs sampled during surgery the next day in 7% to 16% of patients. 23 \u2022 24 Huxley and associates 2S refined these techniques by placing indium-ll1 chloride in the posterior nasopharynx periodically during sleep. On lung scanning, this tracer was found in the lungs of 45% of normal individuals and in 70% of those with some alteration of the central nervous system. Those in the normal group who did not aspirate were fitful sleepers who tended not to enter deep sleep. The implication is that most normal people who enter deep sleep, aspirate. Nasogastric and oropharyngeal tubes, including endoscopes and tracheostomy tubes, increase the risk of aspiration. 26 Normal individuals tend to clear such occult aspirations without difficulty or sequelae. An acute cough reflex is most important, but also valuable are intact mucociliary activity and alveolar macrophage response (see Chapter 3) . The pathologic effects of aspiration are dependent on the character, volume, and frequency of the aspirated components. In this chapter, food and medicinals, gastric acid, lighter hydrocarbons, and heavier oils are separately considered. Aspirated bacteria are covered in the section on abscess formation. Retained squamous IF. Tomashefski, Jr. , and D.H. Dail cells from meconium in newborns are a sign of in utero distress. Squamous cells in the lungs of adults are an indicator of oral, oropharyngeal, or esophageal aspiration ( Fig. 5.3 ). In the absence of other evidence of aspiration, finding mixed bacteria in lung tissue is very suggestive of aspiration of oral content.",

            "text": "Lung injury following aspiration has been subdivided by Marik 27 into aspiration pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonitis refers to acute chemical lung injury due to inhaled gastric acid with or without injury due to aspirated particulate matter, whereas aspiration pneumonia is an infectious process resulting from the inhalation of oropharyngeal secretions colonized by pathogenic bacteriaY Aspiration of gastric acid, a major cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been well studied in humans and in experimental animals. 22 In experimental models, it has been suggested that a pH of 2.4 or lower and a significant quantity of acid (estimated to be 20 to 25mL in an adult human or 1 to 4mLlkg in an experimental animal) are necessary to induce a chemical pneumonitis.27 When gastric acid with methylene blue was put into anesthetized dog tracheas, dye was visible on the pleural surface 12 to 18 seconds later. 28 Atelectasis oflung tissue was noted in 3 minutes. Human studies date from the classic study of Mendelson 29 in 1946, and acute gastric acid aspiration is sometimes called the Mendelson syndrome. Mendelson studied 61 cases of massive gastric aspiration in obstetric patients (0.15% incidence) under ether anesthesia. Respiratory distress occurred soon after aspiration, with accompanying cyanosis, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Bronchospasm occurred in most of his patients. Chest radiographs initially showed rather widespread mottled densities, most of which cleared by 7 to 10 days. Only eight of 61 patients became infected. This study was conducted before antibiotics were readily available, but other studies in humans with or without antibiotics or steroids have confirmed his findings. In general, later studies have found a lower incidence (about 30%) of bronchospasm, more frequent early temperature elevation, and increased mortality (in the range of 30% to 60%) despite therapy. Hypotension and hypoxemia occurred more commonly than in Mendelson's series. 22 The combination of acid and particulate aspiration exacerbates alveolar capillary injury. 30 Bynum and Pierce 3 ! studied 50 patients with welldocumented gastric acid aspiration. In their series, all these events followed altered consciousness, most often by a sedative drug overdose or a general anesthesia. As in Mendelson's29 experience, respiratory symptoms developed rapidly and were very similar in all patients despite eventual outcome. Three clinical outcomes were described: 12% died shortly after aspiration; 62% had rapid clinical and radiographic clearing on the average of 4.5 days; and 26% had rapid improvement followed by deterioration relating to bacterial infection. Of this latter group 60% died, whereas 28% of the whole group died; death occurred between day 1 and 16, averaging 7.2 days. These authors found initial steroid or antibiotic therapy did not affect eventual outcome.",

The pathogenesis of this syndrome, colorfully termed \"iron lung,\" is thought to be a chemical burn induced by oxidation of iron from the ferrous to the ferric form. 64 The radiographic contrast material barium sulfate (BaS04) is also readily visualized by chest x-ray in patients who aspirate this material. Barium is a fairly inert white powder that tends to produce minimal functional lung impairment. Grossly, following barium aspiration, lung parenchyma is chalky, tan-gray, and slightly indurated ( Fig.  5.13A ). Histologically, fine, golden-tan, refractile, weakly birefringent particles of barium sulfate are present within the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages. With chronicity, or upon repeated aspiration, barium-laden macrophages migrate into the interstitium (Fig. 5.13B ).

            "text": "Oils that may be aspirated include mineral oils such as used in nose drops and cathartics, vegetable oils used in cooking, and animal oils such as cod liver oil or fat-soluble vitamin preparations. Mineral oil, derived from petroleum products, is the most common agent of exogenous lipid pneumonia. 68 Oil aspiration was first described by Laughlen 69 in 1925 in a child who received oily oral and pharyngeal preparations for diphtheria; it was confirmed by him experimentally. The role of oil-based contrast media used for bronchoscopy was well reviewed by Spencer. 70 Animal oils cause a more severe inflammatory reaction than mineral or vegetable oils, and this difference appears related to the number of free fatty acids and increased viscosity of animal oi1. 42 ,71.72 Mineral oils are fairly inert, as they have no fatty acids, and are rapidly emulsified and consumed by pulmonary macrophages. Vegetable oil droplets may remain in alveoli for months without eliciting significant reaction, but eventually, due to low-grade chronic irritation, they cause scarring. Animal and mineral oils, but only rarely vegetable oils, may be seen in regional lymph nodes. 71 Aspiration of oils commonly occurs in older individuals, who may take oily nose drops or cathartics at bedtime. Aspiration most frequently gravitates to the basilar segments of the lower lobes suggesting these patients usually sleep in a more upright position or experience aspiration before reclining.73 Because of its weakly irritative nature, mineral oil can enter the tracheobronchial tree without stimulating glottic closure or cough reflex. 74 Only two of 14 cases documenting exogenous lipid pneumonia at autopsy had reported significant clinical symptoms during life. 75 Because these oils float in the stomach, it is possible they also are aspirated via reflux from the stomach,z2.75 In unselected autopsy series, oil aspiration has been documented in 2.5% to 14.6% of adults. 75 .76 Other oily products that have been incriminated as being aspirated in the lung include fragments of lip balm, burning fats (an occupational exposure), a rapid drying agent in spray enamel paint, oils applied to tobacco products (blackfat tobacco), and possibly hair spray.77-81 Children may aspirate oily medications if they are force-fed these while resisting and crying violently.82 Atypical mycobacteria, particularly rapid growers such as Mycobacterium Jortuitum or M. chelonae, have been reported associated with oil aspiration pneumonia (see Chapter 9) . [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] Symptoms of lipid aspiration include fever (39% of patients), weight loss (34%), cough (64%), and dyspnea (50%), although in one large study lipid pneumonia was an incidental finding, without associated symptoms, in 41 % of patients. 68 Lung function tests may indicate either obstructive or restrictive changes. Computed tomography (CT) scans usually show alveolar consolidation or groundglass opacities in the lower lobes. Subfissural clear zones may be interposed between densities, creating a \"sandwich effect\" on CT scan. 68 Grossly, lungs affected by oil aspiration are often gray to yellow and rather solid (Fig. 5.14A ). Dense localized fibrotic lesions (paraffinomas) may grossly mimic cancer or complicated pneumoconiosis. 88 ,89 Occasionally oily droplets exude from the cut surface. Microscopically the lipid droplets are often dissolved by tissue processing. 71 One exception is cod liver oil, which remains as salmoncolored droplets on hematoxylin and eosin stain after tissue processing. Fats may be seen with rapid watersoluble or oil red 0 stains on frozen section ( Fig. 5 .15D); variably sized fat droplets and varying numbers of multinucleate giant cells are present ( Fig. 5 .15A-C). When only a small amount of fat has been aspirated, the reaction may be contained in alveolar macrophages. This is most commonly seen in mild degrees of aspiration with a diluted fatty substance, as might be seen with milk aspiration. When larger doses of thicker and more toxic oils are aspirated or when oil aspiration is repeated, the areas become densely fibrotic with reduction of the background lung architecture ( Fig. 5.14A ).89 Occasionally, cor pulmonale results,90.91 Transbronchial biopsies may provide enough tissue to make this diagnosis. Precise identification of specific lipids can be determined by infrared spectrophotometry. 88 In the differential diagnosis is artifactual collapse of lung around remnant air bubbles (see Fig. 1 .2C in Chapter 1). Exogenous lipid pneumonia can usually be distinguished histologically from endogenous lipid chronically ingested mineral oil as a laxative. Note yellow oil layered on the surface of fluid.",

More recently, Corwin and Irwin 93 restudied this situation using bronchoalveolar lavage in various lung diseases including aspiration, hemoptysis, cancer in the lung (either primary or secondary), bronchiectasis, interstitial fibrosis, and sarcoidosis. When compared to normal lungs, samples from diseased lungs in general contained increased fat-filled macrophages. These authors warned that the simple presence of fatty macrophages in cytology preparations is not diagnostic of lipid pneumonia; however, the quantity of lipid was more abundant in aspirators than in these other groups.

Some more slowly forming nontuberculous abscesses can do this, but most of the abscesses in the lung have an acute initial phase that destroys most of the tissue in the area ( Fig. 5.17B ). Bronchi frequently connect with abscess cavities, allowing drainage of the necrotic material, leaving an empty or partially empty cavity with or without an air/fluid level on chest radiograph (Figs. 5.18 and 5.19). Occasionally, inflammation seals off all such bronchial connections, resulting in a solid mass that may be suspected of being a tumor. Adjacent organization in acute and subacute abscesses often accounts for an enlarged surrounding radiographic density (Figs. 5.17 and 5.18).",

The latter may be more common in nosocomial-acquired lung abscess. 9s -98 Immunocompromised patients often acquire gram-negative necrotizing pneumonias and vasoinvasive necrotizing fungal pneumonias, both of which may lead to cavitation. One clue to aspirated bacteria in lung abscesses is finding mixed-type organisms on smear Gram stain, tissue Gram stain, or culture. The oral cavity abounds with mixed bacteria and is estimated to contain some 200 different types of organisms. 121 This is one reason sputum cultures are notoriously difficult to interpret, and why even oral contamination of a bronchoscope interferes with most lung cultures. 122 Transtracheal and transthoracic needle aspirations, however, correlate well with blood culture results. I 19. 123 The third most frequent factor in abscess formation is host response. Factors that compromise normal host defenses include alcohol ingestion, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, malnutrition, malignancy, and other debilitations, along with treatment with immunosuppressive agents for any reason. Patients with these factors do more poorly with pulmonary abscesses (and most other insults) than those without. [124] [125] [126] Pathologically, acute cavities have only a thin transition zone into the reactive adjacent lung parenchyma (see numbers of neutrophils and macrophages, along with tissue necrosis. The nearby lung parenchyma has variable findings depending on the rapidity of spread. Rapidly growing cavities necrose nearby lung parenchyma, destroying any early attempts at organization. There may be adjacent hemorrhage, exudate, and fibrin extravasation. In those that are slightly more stable, beginning organization occurs in the surrounding lung parenchyma, Sometimes chronic cavities heal with a thin fibrous border and may retain a coagulum of necrotic debris in their lumen. This apparently indicates that the nearby bronchi have been sealed off. Chronic cavities may resolve by collapse and fibrosis, or may remain open. In the open variety they may become reepithelialized, first with a squamous lining and then with ciliated respiratory lining. 127 In the latter case, the distinction from bronchiectasis or bronchocele may be somewhat confusing, but multiple bronchial connections in a chronic abscess cavity distinguish these entities.",

As these products are derived from the lung, this is called endogenous lipid pneumonia. Early in its course the alveolar outlines are well defined though distended with foamy macrophages. If the pneumonia is rapidly reversed, lung function may return. Gradually, permanent damage ensues, including fibrosis and vascular sclerosis, and it is then difficult to restore lung function even though the obstruction may eventually be reversed. Some degree of intraalveolar organization may also be present in approximately 57 % of cases. l44 Features of superimposed infection, such as acute inflammation, necrosis, or abscesses are seen in a minority of cases. 142 In contrast to exogenous (aspiration) lipid pneumonia, endogenous lipid pneumonia is characterized by finely vacuolated fat, absence of a foreign-body response, and minimal inflammation and fibrosis of the underlying lung architecture (Figs. 5.15 and 5.22B,C). Sometimes there are changes that suggest pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis (see below). 145.146 At times parenchymal changes very similar to those just described may be present, although no obstruction of bronchus can be identified, so-called idiopathic cholesterol pneumonia. 147 ,148 In 1949, Robbins and Sniffen 148 described 11 cases of chronic nonobstructive cholesterol pneumonia, 10 of which (91 %) occurred in men aged 32 to 67 years, the only female being a 12-year-old girl. In extent, five of their cases involved most of the lobe and six cases included a portion of one or more segments, often with pleural adhesions; some had small abscess cavities. The involved areas were wedge-shaped with their bases on the pleura and were described as bright yellow; they were accounted for histologically by abundant, finely vacuolated foamy macrophages, but otherwise these areas presented as mass effects. Mucoid or mucopurulent exudate filled some bronchioles and bronchi, but no other cause of obstruction was present. Bronchiectasis was absent, although focal necrotizing bronchitis was noted. The lobar distribution was not documented. These authors argued against aspiration as they noted the usual aspiration to be more diffuse, often multifocal, and more often seen in lower lobes. Lawler able foreign material in 11 (37%) and strongly suspected aspiration in another six for a total of 57% in this series. All except two cases (82 %) of confirmed aspiration were solitary lesions. It seems reasonable that at least some of both chronic organizing pneumonia and idiopathic cholesterol pneumonia, even when not so confirmed, may be the result of aspiration, usually involving ingredients other than exogenous lipid. Secondary chronic organizing pneumonia, involving large portions of a lobe or presenting as a mass lesion, is not to be confused with the distinctive form of interstitial lung disease termed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (bronchiolitis obliteransorganizing pneumonia), which is further discussed in Chapter 4.",

Three patients in this study had severe combined immunodeficiency, two had pulmonary hypertension, and one each had cystic fibrosis (CF), trisomy 10q, and ventricular septal defect (VSD), or lysin uric protein intolerance. All patients exhibited delayed growth, five had digital clubbing, six had depressed appetite or anorexia, five were anemic, and three experienced hemoptysis. Six of eight patients also had evidence of gastroesophageal reflux, which the authors suggest is important in the pathogenesis of this condition. 153 Pulmonary function tests in four patients showed either restrictive or mixed restrictive and obstructive physiology. Chest x-rays predominantly showed nodular pulmonary opacities, while bronchiectasis and perihilar or mild hazy parenchymal infiltrates occurred in one patient each. 153 The mechanism whereby gastroesophageal reflux might elicit this interesting triad of histologic findings is through recurrent micro aspiration of gastric content with associated bronchospasm (see discussion of alveolar proteinosis in Chapter 21). 153 The differential diagnosis of cholesterol pneumonia also includes drug reactions, notably reactions to amiodarone. The clinical history and documentation of amiodarone therapy should facilitate the correct diagnosis (see Chapter 22 and Fig. 22.8) . While the foamy macrophages in both of these disorders resemble each other histologically, electron microscopy demonstrates more abundant osmiophilic dense bodies and giant lamellar bodies in many different cell types in amiodarone toxicity compared to similar but smaller inclusions within macrophages in endogenous lipid pneumonia.146.153~156 Compared to endogenous lipid pneumonia, amiodarone toxicity also encompasses a prominent inflammatory response that may include fibrosis, organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage (see Chapter 22) . 156 Other drugs that have been implicated as a cause of endogenous lipid Cholesterol granulomas not only are associated with endogenous lipid pneumonia and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, but also have been attributed to pulmonary hypertension, organizing hemorrhage, and a unique case of excessive consumption of apples.160-162 Kay and colleagues 163 suggest that cholesterol granulomas in patients with pulmonary hypertension are more likely due to other concomitant processes characterized by type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and degeneration.",

Most often it is caused by internal bronchial obstruction of the air flow (absorption atelectasis) (see Fig. 15 .2 in Chapter 15), but it may result from external compression of the lung, such as by empyema, mesothelioma, constrictive pleural fibrosis, or tumors, or by internal compression, secondary to a bulla, tumor, or other space-occupying lesions (compressive atelectasis). Pneumothorax is an important cause of atelectasis in the ipsilateral lung. Atelectasis may also be caused by a change in metabolism or surface-wetting balance such as with hyaline membrane disease, ARDS, infection, or gastric acid or other aspiration with loss of pulmonary surfactant. It may also have vascular causes as with embolism, postoperative splinting, obesity (e.g., pickwickian syndrome), or secondary to nerve or muscle dysfunction of diaphragm or chest wall. Following complete airway obstruction, atelectasis occurs when alveolar oxygen and nitrogen are absorbed. Atelectasis is also commonly seen around chronic inflammatory reactions such as bronchiectasis, and may be part of the sequence of events leading to bronchiectasis (see below). Pathologists must be cautious, however, because most often, when observed histologically, atelectasis is artifactual. Upon the release of negative pressure, air escapes from the lung when the thorax is opened or when lung tissue is excised, and this collapse may cause confusion with preexisting atelectasis (see Fig. 1 ",

It is found more than twice as frequently in the left lower lobe as in the right. 17S -J77 Next in frequency are the right middle lobe and its counterpart, the lingula. These areas of the lung may have the poorest drainage. The upper lobes may be involved but are usually not solely involved by nonobstructive bronchiectasis. Tuberculosis more selectively causes bronchiectasis in the upper lobes, and cystic fibrosis should be considered in cases of upper lobe involvement without a definitive etiology. About one third of the cases of nonobstructive bronchiectasis have bilateral involvement. 176.178,179 Macroscopically bronchiectasis typically involves the second to the eighth order of segmental bronchi, sparing the larger, more proximal airways, which are protected by a firmly supporting cartilaginous network. 179 -181 More distal airways are often obliterated or effaced as the number of bronchial divisions is reduced (Fig. 5.25 ).173,182 Within a bronchopulmonary segment there may be patchy involvement (see Fig. 1.9 in Chapter 1). There is also apparent loss of more distal lung parenchyma as the dilated airways approach the visceral pleura ( Fig. 5.25) . 173, 182 Bronchiectasis has been divided into many different patterns grossly and radiographically. The most widely applied classification is that suggested by Reid l82 : (1) saccular (cystic), (2) cylindrical (fusiform or tubular), and (3) varicose. In the saccular form, the distal extensions of the bronchi are more dilated than proximal portions, described by Reid as \"globular ballooning.\" Usually, the second-to fourth-order bronchi are involved. Cylindrical bronchiectasis consists of evenly enlarged tubular dilatation of bronchi, usually involving the sixth-to eighthorder bronchi. IS I On bronchograms dilated bronchi come to an abrupt, square-ended termination thought to be caused by impacted endobronchial secretion.173 The varicose type describes focal dilatation separated by more narrow areas (see Fig. 1.9 in Chapter 1). These various gross patterns were previously best visualized by bronchography, and are not specific for any given etiology, although certain clinical-pathologic correlations have been made (see below).",

            "text": "Whitwell 175 integrated histologic features into his classification of follicular, saccular, and atelectatic bronchiectasis. Follicular bronchiectasis most frequently begins in childhood as the sequela of viral infections, most notably adenovirus. 183 Saccular bronchiectasis, in Whitwell's series, was often found to be postinfective or idiopathic. The pathogenesis of atelectatic bronchiectasis was linked to lobar bronchial obstruction, often by enlarged lymph nodes. Congenital bronchiectasis, purportedly due to cartilage deficiency in the bronchial walls, is a controversial entity discussed elsewhere in this chapter under the Williams-Campbell syndrome. 180 ,1S1,184 Not to be confused with congenital bronchiectasis are those hereditary conditions, such as cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia, that predispose to the subsequent development of progressi ve bronchiectasis (see below). 174, 180 Patients with bronchiectasis typically present clinically with forceful cough, purulent sputum production, wheezing, and recurrent pneumonia in the bronchiectatic zones. Wet bronchiectasis refers to abundant inflammation and mucus hypersecretion, whereas dry bronchiectasis refers to minimal sputum production. Dry bronchiectasis is most common in the upper lobes, is often of the cylindrical type, and probably relates to better drainage in this zone. Hemoptysis commonly presents as blood-streaked sputum, but may be massive and life-threatening. Frequently purulent sinusitis accompanies bronchiectasis and may contribute to its development. The chest radiograph is usually abnormal in bronchiectasis, including specific features of ring-like shadows due to dilated airways seen on end, or of tram lines when the airways are visualized longitudinally. ISS High-resolution CT scan is the best current modality for diagnosing bronchiectasis, revealing airways that are dilated relative to the adjacent blood vessels, lack of airway tapering, constrictions along the path of the airway, and terminal balloon-like cystS. IS5 ,IS6 Pulmonary function tests show obstructive changes with reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/ forced vital capacity (FVC) and frequently airway hyperresponsiveness. 185 Various theories have been proposed to explain nonobstructive bronchiectasis. Inflammation seems to best account for the changes that are observed, including the fact that the involved zones of lung are those most difficult to drain. It was known even in the 1930s and confirmed in subsequent decades that respiratory infection often preceded bronchiectasis. 175 ,176,187-192 Usually older children and young adults have the well-developed disease pattern, but also have a history of infections before the age of 2 or 3 years, with recurrent respiratory problems dating from this time. 187 Many patients may appear stable and do well for some time, and then develop a progressive course of recurrent infections and systemic toxicity. 174, [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] [182] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] [197] [198] [199] [200] In approximately 50% of cases of bronchiectasis, however, a specific inciting factor is not identified-so-called idiopathic bronchiectasis . 195 In these patients, childhood respiratory infections especially those likely to have produced bronchiolitis obliterans, are presumed to have initiated the process of bronchiectasis. 173 ,195,196 Viral infections may be important in many cases. 167 ,194,196-203 Glauser and associates 204 noted in an extensive review that measles and pertussis immunizations probably have played a significant role in decreasing the incidence of bronchiectasis. Bacteria also playa significant role, both in primary infections (see following) and in superinfections or reinfections in areas of previous injury. Aggressive treatment of pediatric pulmonary infections with antibiotics has helped to make bronchiectasis a disappearing disease. 204 Historically, the impact of immunizations and antibiotics on the declining incidence of bronchiectasis occurred at about the same time, and it is difficult to differentiate their effects; nonetheless, this association supports the role of early infection in initiating bronchiectasis.",

However, another study noted a 15% incidence of sinusitis in cases with less than 5 years of symptoms of bronchiectasis compared to the 44% incidence in all cases of bronchiectasis. 179 H. infiuenzae, a common pathogen of the upper respiratory tract, is also found with some regularity in lung cultures from patients with bronchiectasis.

            "text": "Necrotizing inflammation involves bronchial walls and adjacent parenchyma (Fig. 5.26 ) . Some scarring probably takes place in healing, with retraction of surrounding tissue. Retraction occurs circumferentially, and bronchial dilatation results. As noted, the more distal bronchi and bronchioles are often destroyed. There is also general lung contracture due to atelectasis of involved zones, while nonaffected lobes may undergo compensatory hyperinflation (Fig. 5.26) . The basic principles of fibrosis and contraction also apply to traction bronchiectasis seen in interstitial fibrosis and honeycombing.172 Traction bronchiectasis is usually not as marked as primary bronchiectasis, and is localized and most severe in the peripheral subpleural zones where fibrosis is often most prominent (see Chapter 19) . 172 Grossly, the involved lung tissue is usually atelectatic, gray-blue, shrunken, and rubbery. There may be zones of golden or obstructive pneumonia, and sometimes these zones form layers around the dilated bronchial tubes. It may be difficult or impossible to adequately inflate such a chronically contracted specimen. The involved bronchi are dilated instead of following their smoothly contoured courses as they extend peripherally. These dilated bronchi almost reach the pleural surface and run in a somewhat parallel or radial fashion without interbronchial connections (Figs. 5.25 and 5.26). Partially or totally circumferential thin folds in the mucosa extend internally from the wall and are seen as transverse infolded pleats on the bronchial cast (see Fig. 1.9 in Chapter 1). These give the appearance of webs or bands of mucosa. There are variably sized outpouchings, larger ones between the remnant bronchial cartilages, and dilated smaller pits that appear to be dilated submucosal glands. Grossly, elastic fibers can be seen still running through the wall, but these are more widely separated than is normal because of the stretched diameter of the bronchus. In wet bronchiectasis there is thickening of the wall, and mucinous, granular, semisolid material accumulates within the lumen (Fig. 5.27 ). Occasionally this material hardens and even calcifies (see broncholithiasis, below). In dry bronchiectasis the wall is thin, almost translucent, and gray-pink without mural thickening.",

Submucosal glands and surface goblet cells are not prominent and may decrease, although they may occasionally increase. Elastic tissue is preserved except in areas of necrosis (Fig. 5.28 ). Smooth muscle is usually present and often shows some degree of hypertrophy; occasionally this is atrophic. Cartilage seems less obvious and occasionally is eroded, but most often appears normal histologically. In advanced saccular bronchiectasis cartilage is markedly reduced or absent. 173 ,205,206 Neutrophils, macrophages, and desquamated and mucinous debris are present in the bronchial lumen in wet bronchiectasis. Acute inflammatory cells may infiltrate the bronchial wall or the adjacent lung parenchyma depending on the status of inflammation and active infection at the time of lung removal. As these patients are subject to recurrent infections, acute pneumonia may also be present. Lymphocytes and plasma cells usually predominate in bronchial wall and surrounding lung tissue. In follicular bronchiectasis, hyperplastic lymphoid follicles may appear to constrict the bronchial lumens (Fig. 5.29 ).175 There may be a degree of obstructive pneumonia correlating with the gross yellow color. Small granulomas are present in a few cases, apparently as a reaction to inspissated material within the bronchi. If granulomas are extensive or present in the adjacent lung parenchyma, in more normally contoured segmental and subsegmental bronchi, or in lymph nodes, one must consider fungal or mycobacterial infections. If granulomas are confined to the injured areas, one must also consider aspiration. Bronchioles are often constricted or obliterated beyond the dilated bronchi (Fig.  5.30 ). Other small airways may be dilated and sometimes mucus-filled probably because of their obstruction at the junction with the larger bronchi. Foci of carcinoid atypical proliferation (tumorlets) occur with some frequency in bronchiectasis (see Chapter 36) . Bronchial arteries respond to sustained inflammation, and may exceed 1 mm in diameter. 207 Ulceration of these systemic arteries accounts for the bright-red appearance of hemoptysis.",

The middle lobe bronchus is relatively narrow, and there are frequently moderately prominent nodes in the angle of bifurcation that may compress and further constrict the bronchus. The subcarinal node may even approach this angle. Several authors have also suggested there is less effective collateral ventilation in the middle, compared to the adjacent upper lobe. 208 .209 Because of these anatomic characteristics there is a greater tendency toward middle lobe and lingular atelectasis, inflammation, nonspecific scarring, broncholith formation, and bronchiectasis-collectively termed middle lobe syndrome (MLS) .2IO In addition to peribronchial lymphadenopathy, MLS can result from numerous disorders including asthma, tuberculosis, foreign bodies, CF, broncholiths, endobronchial silicosis, cardiovascular and of bronchiolar wall. White arrow indicates cross section of separate, obliterated airway (patient with CF) (elastic van Gieson stain). bronchopulmonary malformations, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. 2 11-213 The pathologic findings in resected lung specimens of 21 patients with middle lobe syndrome have been comprehensively described most recently by Kwon and colleagues,212 and are delineated in Table 5 .3. Although the histologic findings are nonspecific, a combination of bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis, and atelectasis is typical. 212 In this series, a mechanical obstruction (broncholith) was identified in only one patient. 212 As early as 1966, Culiner 208 also recognized bronchial patency in most cases of middle lobe syndrome. The current understanding suggests that MLS is due to recurrent infection related to poor lung drainage, possibly associated with intermittent obstruction of the precariously situated bronchi in the setting of reduced collateral ventilation of the middle lobe.208.212",

Occasionally, erosive calcified nodes may cause bronchopleural fistulas and are the most common cause of bronchoesophageal fistulas, [228] [229] [230] Retraction diverticula of the esophagus may also occur secondary to peribronchial fibrosis and calcified mediastinallymph nodes associated with broncholiths. 218 ,231 Calcified nodes have also been studied with CT scans.232 In the retrospective series by Conces et al.,227 of 15 patients with CT-proven broncholiths, 11 (73 % ) had juxtabronchial calcified nodes identified on chest radiographs.

It may be either congenital, or early or late acquired, usually of postinflammatory nature but sometimes of malignant nature.238 Localized emphysema, which occurs around the bronchocele, may be caused either by inflammation early in lung growth with continued traction-type effects on nearby lung, or by sustained air-trapping due to airway obstruction. 237 ,239.24o Many cases are reported as bronchial atresia.241-245 Bronchocele/ atresia may present in adults or children and typically affects the left upper lobe.

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis is a prototypic example of bronchocentric inflammation and bronchiectasis and the most common lethal genetic disease among Caucasians, having a frequency of approximately 1 in 2500 live births.259-261 The molecular defect of this autosomal recessive disorder was discovered in 1989 to involve mutations in a 1480 amino acid polypeptide, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), encoded by a gene on the long arm of chromosome 7. 262 ,263 Over 1000 different mutations of the CFTR gene have so far been identified, but the most frequent mutation worldwide and the most severe genetic lesion, is the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of CFTR (AF508), accounting for over 70% of affected patients. 26o , 264 Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator functions as a cell membrane-associated, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channel, which also has regulatory activity on the absorption of sodium through a separate epithelial channel (ENaC).264-266 The structure of CFTR is schematically depicted in Figure 5 .34. Mutations in CFTR have been grouped into six major types, each of which may present phenotypically as CF: (1) lack of synthesis of CFTR; (2) defective processing of CFTR such that it does not reach the cell membrane; (3) aberrant regulation of ion transport due to dysfunctional CFTR; (4) abnormal conductance of chloride ions; (5) partly defective production and processing; or (6) accelerated turnover at the cell surface ( Fig. 5.35) . 259, 261, 267, 268 The AF508 mutation is a type 2 defect in which abnormal CFTR is sequestered within cellular organelles leading to reduced insertion into the cell membrane, markedly limiting the ability of chloride to cross the membrane. 269 In epithelial cells of bronchi, biliary tract, and intestine, impaired transport of intracellular chloride and its accompanying water molecules leads to dehydration of ductal and lumen secretions. 26o In bronchial epithelium there is also enhanced intracellular absorption of sodium ions, which further dehydrates secretions within the airway lumen. 26o ,264,266 In contrast, the uptake of extracellular chloride is inhibited in sweat ducts, causing an elevation of sweat chloride concentration, a key diagnostic indicator of CF. 260 ,270 The manifestations of CF are protean, involving nearly every organ system either directly or secondarily. The correlation between genotype and phenotypic expression is best exhibited for pancreatic function and is relatively poor for pulmonary manifestations. 267 ,271,272 However, certain mutations such as A455E or the IVS8 5T allele are associated with relatively mild lung disease that may initially present in adults.m-276 A unifying feature of the pathophysiology of CF is impaction of viscid secretions in exocrine gland ducts leading to cardinal manifestations such as intestinal obstruction (e.g., meconium ileus); pancreatic acinar atrophy and fibrosis with consequent metabolic insufficiency (due to intestinal malabsorption); organ maldevelopment (e.g., congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens); hepatic fibrosis (focal biliary cirrhosis); and infection associated with mucus stasis (e.g., infective bronchitis).26o,277 Pulmonary involvement is usually The lungs in CF are structurally normal at birth. Dilatation of mucous gland ducts followed by intrabronchial mucus stasis are the earliest pulmonary lesions seen in infants. 261 ,279,28o It has long been recognized that patients with CF are predisposed to lung infection. 28 1.282 Current hypotheses suggest that susceptibility to infection may be related not only to entrapment of bacteria in thick bronchial secretions, but also possibly to abnormal binding and reduced uptake of bacteria by epithelial cells, or impaired epithelial antimicrobial protection provided by defensins (natural antibiotics of the innate immunity system).259.283-289 Even in infants without apparent infection, however, bronchoalveolar lavage studies document ongoing bronchial inflammation associated with increased levels of endobronchial IL-8, a potent cytokine that recruits neutrophils into the inflammatory response, and relatively decreased levels of IL-lO, an inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokines. 29 G-294 It is as yet undetermined whether or not intrinsically exaggerated inflammatory responses are the direct result of mutations in CFTR. 295 Infection and inflammation stimulate bronchial mucus secretion leading to a vicious cycle of worsening airway infection and obstruction, progressing to chronic bronchitis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and bronchiectasis. 286 The chronic pulmonary complications of CF evolve from the airway disease.277 Hyperinflation or collapse is the direct result of bronchial obstruction. Air trapping and postinflammatory cystic lesions underlie an increased susceptibility to recurrent pneumothorax. Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale derive from sustained hypoxia, while hemoptysis is a direct effect of bronchiectasis and bronchial artery hypertrophy. 277 Endobronchial infection tends to occur in sequential fashion, initiated by S. aureus, followed by H. injluenzae, and finally by P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains).260.2 8 Submucosal glands are enlarged and chronically inflamed behind ducts that are obstructed by dense, inspissated, eosinophilic secretion (a characteristic, but not pathognomonic feature of CF) (Fig. 5.36 ).300-302 Although bronchial smooth muscle in individual patients may appear hypertrophic, its mean volume density is within the normal range. 300",

In severe disease, bronchi terminate in large, juxtapleural, thin-walled cavities that present radiographically as contiguous, bubble-like cysts. Intrapleural blebs or emphysematous bullae are less common forms of cystic lesions, which contribute to an increased incidence of pneumothorax.305.306 Extensive acute and chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiolar mucoid impaction impart a finely nodular texture to the parenchymal surface and account for a micronodular radiographic appearance ( Fig. 5.38 ).307 Bronchiolitis obliterans, predominantly of the constrictive type, contributes importantly to airway obstruction, and likely precedes the development of bronchiectasis (see Fig. 5 .30).301.308 Occasionally, occlusion of respiratory bronchioles by polypoidal protrusions of fibroblastic tissue accompanies interstitial and organizing pneumonia?09 Small airway density decreases with age and is most significantly reduced in patients with hypercapnia. 310.311 The lung parenchyma is grossly indurated by multifocal, bronchocentric chronic pneumonia and fibrosis, with features of both organizing pneumonia and endogenous lipid (cholesterol) pneumonia. A variable degree of acute bronchopneumonia may also be seen at autopsy. Some patients who are colonized by Burkholderia cepacia undergo an accelerated decline due to acute necrotizing pneumonia (see Figs. 8.61 and 8.62 in Chapter 8). Other patients colonized by Burkholderia follow a more protracted course, similar to those colonized by P aeruginosa. [312] [313] [314] Fungi and nontuberculous mycobacteria may also colonize CF airways and contribute to lung destruction. 288 ,315,316 Bhargava and colleagues 317 identified fungal organisms histologically in 21 % of CF patients retrospectively studied at autopsy. The dilated, obstructed airways of CF patients are predisposed to fungal colonization, accounting for an increased prevalence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) of approximately 2.0%.318 Infrequently the pathologic features of ABPA, including bronchocentric granulomatosis, are superimposed on chronic CF-associated airways disease (see Fig. 15 .19 in Chapter 15).277 In CF patients with non tuberculous mycobacterial infections (often due to Mycobacterium avium or rapidly growing strains like M. chelonae or M. abscessus), necrotizing fibrocaseous granulomas may be present. 315 ,316,319,320 Pulmonary lesions are most likely to be found in patients with repeatedly positive sputum cultures for mycobacteria (see Chapter 9) . 320 The pulmonary vascular changes of CF-associated lung disease are usually pronounced, Chronic hypoxia and inflammatory changes contribute to pulmonary artery medial hypertrophy and intimal fibrosis of muscular pulmonary arteries and medial myxoid degeneration of elastic arteries.321-326 Postmortem arteriograms often show abnormally tapered arteries with a reduced background haze (see Fig. 1 .8 in Chapter 1).277 Morphometric studies provide evidence of a decreased density of arteries, which correlates inversely with the degree of right ventricular cardiac hypertrophy,321 The dropout of arteries may be related to impaired postnatal growth or to vascular destruction secondary to chronic hypoxia or sustained inflammation. 321 Right ventricular cardiac hypertrophy, seen at autopsy in approximately 84% of CF patients older than 3 years of age, is a direct consequence of pulmonary artery remodeling and associated pulmonary hypertension. 321 Bronchial arteries also undergo significant hypertrophy as a response to sustained bronchial inflammation, bronchiectasis, and bronchocentric abscesses (Fig.  5.39 ).327-329 The source of hemoptysis in CF patients is most frequently the delicate capillaries within airway granulation tissue (see Fig. 5 .28),330,331 Occasionally, mucosal ulcers erode into hypertrophied bronchial vessels leading to life-threatening massive hemoptysis (Fig. 5.39 ). Interventional bronchial artery embolization of metal coils, polyvinyl alcohol (Ivalon), or Gelfoam particles is undertaken to induce thrombosis and control bronchial artery bleeding. 331 ,332 Degenerated remnants of embolized polyvinyl alcohol may surround stenotic or occluded bronchial arteries in patients who have undergone this procedure. 333 Bronchopulmonary arterial anastomoses may further allow the paradoxical entry of small embolized particles into the pulmonary arterial circuit (see Fig.  28 .42 in Chapter 28). 334 Other less frequently reported complications of cystic fibrosis include systemic amyloidosis, intralobar sequestration, and anaerobic lung abscess. 335 -338 Emphysema is usually a minor feature, localized to bronchiolocentric scars or as paraseptal emphysema in the upper lung zonesYS,30S,329 Cystic fibrosis patients with indwelling venous access devices may surreptitiously inject aqueous suspensions of psychoactive pharmaceutical tablets leading to pulmonary artery obstruction due to embolized tablet filler materials (see Chapter 26).339 Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder, occurring in approximately 1 of 15,000 to 30,000 persons, characterized by the absence or dysregulation of ciliary movement mainly due to ultrastructural defects in the ciliary axoneme. (see Chapter 2)?40-344 Cilia on the respiratory epithelial surface play an important role in propelling mucus, bacteria, and inhaled particulate debris out of the lung (see Chapter 3). As a result of impaired clearance due to ciliary malfunction, patients with PCD are predisposed to chronic sinusitis, serous otitis, and recurrent bronchopulmonary infections beginning in early childhood. 345 ,346 Primary ciliary dyskinesia has also been implicated as a cause of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. 347 ,348 Male patients are usually infertile due to poor flagellar motility of sperm. 345 Approximately 50% of patients with PCD also have situs inversus secondary to abnormal rotation of embryonic epithelia consequent to the lack of ciliary movement. 343 The syndromic triad of situs inversus, sinusitis and bronchiectasis was first proposed by Kartagener in 1933, and is now designated Kartagener's syndrome (Fig.  5.40 ).349.350 While PCD is an important cause of bronchiectasis, the prognosis is generally more favorable than that of CF. 340 In 1976 Afzelius 340 and Pedersen and Mygind 341 were among the first to recognize that ultrastructural abnormalities of ciliary dyne in arms were associated with Kartagener's syndrome. Originally termed immotile cilia syndrome by Afzelius, it is now recognized that there are numerous structural variations that may contribute to IF. Tomashefski, Jr., and D.H. Dail PCD, and that cilia are not always immotile?51 When compared to normal (Fig. 5.40A) , the most commonly observed ultrastructural defects are the complete absence of dyne in arms or the selective absence of either inner or outer arms (Fig. 5.40B ). Other derangements of the axoneme contributing to PCD include defective or absent radial spokes (Fig. 5.41D ), transposition of microtubules (Fig. 5.41C ) (well seen in longitudinal sections of cilia), central microtubular agenesis, absence of nexin links, agenesis of cilia, or rarely, bizarre cystic dilatation of ciliary shafts. 352 -356 Nonspecific findings such as ciliary blebs, megacilia, compound cilia, and displaced microtubules may accompany the more specific defects, but are also frequently present in inflammatory airway disease of diverse causes including infectious bronchitis, CF, or air pollution. 35 6-361 Some patients with structurally normal cilia and a normal ciliary beat frequency may develop the clinical manifestations of PCD due to ciliary disorientation, resulting in uncoordinated ciliary motion (Fig. 5.40E ).362,363 Ciliary disorientation has also been described in individuals with infectious bronchitis (including CF), but the degree of disorientation is usually not as great as in those in whom the defect is primary, and the disorientation secondary to infection typically resolves after effective antibiotic treatment. 299 The diagnosis of PCD is established by ultrastructural analysis of respiratory epithelium in conjunction with typical clinical manifestations, exclusion of other causes of chronic airway inflammation, and documentation of abnormal ciliary motion by phase contrast microscopy.344.364,365 Mucosal samples obtained by endoscopic biopsy or brushing are examined by transmission electron microscopy. In patients with PCD, nasal mucosal samples are reflective of bronchial changes when most cilia are abnormal. When only few cilia are structurally abnormal in a patient in whom the diagnosis of PCD is highly suspected, a bronchial sample is required. 366 Abnormalities in sperm flagella may differ in type and quantity from those of respiratory cilia within the same patient, suggesting separate genetic control of axone mal structures at differing loci? The lung pathology in PCD is postinfective in appearance. Both saccular and cylindrical bronchiectasis may be present with the predominant histologic pattern of follicular bronchiectasis. 175 ,350,370 Neither bronchial mucus stasis nor squamous metaplasia is prominent Chronic interstitial pneumonitis, peribronchial fibrosis, and atelectasis accompany the bronchiectatic changes. 349 ,370,371 Studies to date suggest that PCD is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. The molecular basis of PCD has been localized in a few instances to mutations in the human dyne in axonemal heavy chain (DNAH5) located on chromosome 5, or in the intermediate dynein chain gene 1 (DNAIl) on chromosome 9,372-374 A mutation in the dyne in axonemal heavy chain type 11 (DNAHll) has been associated with PCD and situs inversus, without evident ultrastructural ciliary changes, 372 Ongoing studies on genetically engineered knockout mice may uncover other genetic defects associated with PCn,372,375",

Bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis were each present in about two thirds of patients. In one study it was estimated that Young's syndrome accounted for approximately 3% of all patients who presented with bronchiectasis of unknown etiology (equivalent to the prevalence of CF and slightly greater than that of PCD). 195 Azoospermia in Young's syndrome is the result of retention of semen in an enlarged epididymal head. Motility studies have demonstrated impaired upper airway mucociliary transport; however, ciliary beat frequency and ultrastructure are normal. 377 ,378,382,383 In patients with Young's syndrome, sweat chloride concentration and the electrical potential difference across the nasal epithelium are normal. 384 The respiratory symptoms in Young's syndrome have been suggested to be the result of altered viscoelastic properties of airway secretions, but the basic molecular defect is unknown. 385 An association with mercury toxicity has been hypothesized. 386 Friedman and colleagues 380 evaluated mutations of CFTR in a cohort of patients with Young's syndrome and found that the prevalence of mutations did not differ significantly from the expected carrier frequency in the general population.",

Highresolution CT scan characteristically shows central, cystic, thin-walled airways that collapse upon expiration. 404.405 The clinical course is one of recurrent pulmonary infections leading to respiratory failure. Patients may survive into adulthood and require lung transplantation. 406 As described in the original report by Williams and Campbell and substantiated in subsequent morphologic studies, the lungs grossly exhibit extreme saccular and cystic bronchiectasis (Fig. 5.43A ).406-409 Microscopically, dilated airways have very thin walls with minimal inflammation (Fig. 5.43B ). Cartilage is absent or markedly deficient from the fourth to the eighth divisions of subsegmental bronchi. First-and second-order bronchi usually have a normal cartilage investment. Pan acinar emphysema or emphysema localized to the peribronchial zone is usually also present.406.407 Bronchiolitis obliterans has also been reported.403.407 The Williams-Campbell syndrome has been considered to be the result of a congenital absence of cartilage in the subsegmental airways. Morphologic studies documenting absent cartilage and insignificant inflammation, and rare reports of familial occurrence have been used to support this view.402.409.410 However, given the propensity for cartilage loss in acquired saccular bronchiectasis of diverse etiologies, the Williams-Campbell syndrome remains a controversial entity, and its congenital origins have yet to be proven beyond question. 175.205.206.407 The Williams-Campbell syndrome has not been associated, nor is it to be confused, with congenital lobar emphysema, in which cartilage is focally deficient, usually in upper lobe bronchi, leading to bronchial collapse and air trapping (see also Chapter 6).411",

TBM can be congenital, or at least evident in early life, in which it is termed Mounier-Kuhn syndrome (see Chapter 6) . It has occurred in several cases of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, suggesting it may be related to poor elastic support, or perhaps to loss of other matrix components as in chondromalacia. 412 Tracheobronchomegaly occurs in adults, mostly in men in their fourth and fifth decades, and can be an acquired condition secondary to sustained inflammation affecting the trachea, such as in chronic tracheo- bronchitis secondary to tobacco abuse, cystic fibrosis, trauma, emphysema, or pulmonary fibrosis. 412, 413 A comprehensive review and an intriguing study of various pulmonary fibrotic reactions associated with this entity was reported by Woodring et al. 412 These investigators evaluated the tracheal diameter on plain chest radiography in a series of 34 cases of fibrotic lung reactions, and found enlargement of the trachea in 10 (29%). The associated lung diseases were idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis in four patients each, and progressive histoplasmosis in two patients. In seven of these patients as well as in nine of 24 patients (38%) who did not meet initial radiographic criteria for tracheal dilatation, tracheomegaly developed or progressed over time, Tracheobronchomegaly was usually associated with moderate-to-severe restrictive pulmonary defects, and it was proposed that shrinkage of the lung tissue retracts all adjacent spaces including the trachea in a manner similar to traction bronchiectasis. 412 Regardless of the cause ofTBM, airway dilatation may extend distally, Bronchomegaly simulates bronchiectasis, probably impairs lung clearance, and promotes recurrent bronchopulmonary infection, which paradoxically may induce secondary bronchiectasis. 412 Roditi and Weir 414 identified tracheobronchomegaly in 17% of patients with evidence of bronchiectasis on CT scan, thereby emphasizing the frequent association and possible causal connections between these two conditions. 414 Tracheobronchomegaly is predominantly a radiologic diagnosis, and its pathologic features have not been well characterized. Associated radiographic features include marked tracheal wall thinning, scalloping due to mural infolding, bronchial diverticula, and collapse on expiration. 415 . 416 The diagnostic criteria of TBM by CT scan are a tracheal diameter of greater than 3cm (measured 2cm above the aortic arch) and diameters of 2.4 and 2.3 cm for the right and left main bronchi, respectively.415Al? Tracheobronchomegaly must be distinguished from saber-sheath trachea, seen in some patients with emphysema, in which there is a decrease in tracheal coronal diameter and increased sagittal diameter. 415 .4 1 8",

No unique features of bronchiectasis were described. Patients with CVID are treated with immunoglobulin replacement therapy, which reduces the severity and frequency of respiratory infections. Symptomatic bronchiectasis, identified by HRCT scan, has also been reported in patients with HIV disease in whom it is associated with rapidly progressive airways obstruction. 43o , 431 King and colleagues 432 correlated airway dilatation on CT scan with increased neutrophils on bronchoalveolar lavage. A single report of a transbronchial biopsy showed only nonspecific lymphocytic peribronchiolitis. 431 The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis in HIV patients is likely consequent to bronchial damage from recurrent pneumonia and bacterial bronchitis in this immunosuppressed population. 430 .433 Frequently cultured microorganisms include H. injluenzae, P. aeruginosa, and S. pneumoniae. 430 ,433 Bronchiectasis also occurs as a complication of lung transplant-associated immunosuppression and bronchiolitis obliterans and is further discussed in Chapter 23. 434.435 Rheumatoid Arthritis Symptomatic bronchiectasis is estimated to occur in 1 % to 3% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), although with HRCT scan, up to 30% of patients with RA can be shown to have cylindrical bronchiectasis. 185 .4 3 6,437 Early autopsy studies of patients with RA provided a prevalence of bronchiectasis of 0% to 12%. [438] [439] [440] [441] In some studies bronchiectasis typically preceded the development of arthritis, leading to the interesting hypothesis that chronic suppurative airway disease is involved in the pathogenesis of RA.442-444 Shadick and colleagues,444 however, reported 23 patients with bronchiectasis and RA, of whom 18 developed bronchiectasis as a late complication of severe RA. Bronchiectasis may also be more frequent in patients with RA-associated Sjogren's syndrome.442A45 Bronchiectasis associated with RA cannot be adequately ascribed to either traction bronchiectasis or therapeutic immunosuppression. 436 ,444 The morphologic features of RA-associated bronchiectasis are not well documented.

The chronic inflammatory infiltrate involves bronchial glands and ducts; however, lymphoid germinal centers are usually absent, distinguishing ulcerative colitis-associated bronchiectasis from the usual pattern of follicular bronchiectasis (Fig.  5 .44B).175,446 Neutrophils infiltrating the mucosa and spilling into the dilated bronchial lumen impart a suppurative appearance in some cases. 44 6--449 Direct immunofluorescence staining of bronchial biopsies in three patients with ulcerative colitis showed deposits of immunoglobulin and complement in bronchial structures. 448 Lung biopsy in patients with Crohn's disease and bronchiectasis may show features of either granulomatous bronchiolitis or suppurative-appearing acute bronchiolitis (see Fig.  20 .27 in Chapter 20).450 Inhaled steroids were of durable benefit in patients with IBD-associated chronic bronchitis, but less so in patients with bronchiectasis. 446 Speculations on the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis in IBD are presented in a provocative editorial by Stockley.451 ",

Comparative features of congenital disorders of bronchiectasis and obstructive azoospermia CBAVD, congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens; UL, upper lobe; LL, lower lobe; CF, cystic fibrosis; PCD, primary ciliary dyskinesia, <Xl-An ti trypsin Deficiency Bronchiectasis has been reported in individuals with <X1antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, but its prevalence has been variable, with some series suggesting frequent occurrence and others not (see alsoChapter 24).389-393 Orell and Mazodier,394 using whole lung macrosections, identified cylindrical bronchiectasis in three of six patients with AAT. King et al.395 identified six of 14 patients with AAT deficiency to have CT evidence of bronchiectasis. Cystic bronchiectasis was seen in two patients and cylindrical bronchiectasis in four. Histologic evaluation of two patients revealed emphysema and dilatation of large and small airways with multifocal disruption of bronchiolar elastic fibers. In a review of the pulmonary pathology of 42 patients enrolled in the national registry for individuals with severe deficiency of AAT, mild or moderate bronchiectasis was identified pathologically in only six patients (14%)(Fig. 5.42B)?96 In the entire clinical registry, bronchiectasis was self-reported in a small minority of patients (3.4%). A more frequent histologic finding seen in 46% of autopsied patients in the registry was ectasia of membranous bronchioles in areas of severe emphysema(Fig. 5.42B).395.396 These observations suggest that bronchiectasis inAAT is secondary to matrix destruction in small airways coupled with loss of airway support due to severe emphysema (see alsoChapter 24).396 Some patients with AAT and bronchiectasis have other associated causes of bronchiectasis such as CF, immune deficiency, or childhood pneumonia.389 .397   Eighteen percent to 27% of patients with severe, AAT-replete emphysema have localized bronchiectasis as a minor contributory factor to airflow obstruction. 398 -400Thurlbeck 398  cautioned that so-called cylindrical bronchiectasis in patients with severe emphysema in the general population may simply represent airway dilata-tion in full inspiration. Conversely, in patients in whom bronchiectasis is the primary cause of airflow obstruction, emphysema in the immediate vicinity of the ectatic airways is frequently observed.398.399 Anderson and Foraker 401 documented alternating ectasia and narrowing of small airways as a constant feature in severely emphysematous lungs.",
