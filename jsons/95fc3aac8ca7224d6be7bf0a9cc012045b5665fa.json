            "text": "The delay between the WHO being made aware of the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa and declaring it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been the subject of some considerable criticism in the literature, as well as in the Report of the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel commissioned by the WHO, which stated that that 'significant and unjustifiable delays occurred in the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO.' This paper examines this late declaration of a PHEIC for Ebola through the lens of the law of responsibility, arguing that the WHO incurs responsibility for this delay. The law of responsibility is long standing in international law as the framework for providing redress for breaches of law. It gives rise to an obligation to provide redress and ensures some form of culpability for a breach of international law. In this paper we argue that the WHO does not merely have the power to declare a PHEIC via the International Health Regulations (2005), but also has a legal obligation to do so when the criteria are met. An obligation which we argue, they breached in failing to declare the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa a PHEIC in a timely manner. This breach should then engage the law of responsibility for the consequences of the delay. The paper argues, however, that there exist substantial issues with the application of the principles of responsibility to international organizations.",

The key principles in the law of responsibility establish that responsibility will arise when an internationally wrongful act has been committed, which constitutes a breach of international law, and which is attributable to the international actor concerned. 2 In this chapter we apply the principles of the law of responsibility to the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic, arguing that legal responsibility can be established at an international level on the part of the World Health Organisation (WHO) for their delayed action in respect of the West African Ebola response.",

            "text": "The West African Ebola epidemic began in Guinea during December 2013, 3 and the WHO was officially notified of the outbreak on the 23rd of March, 2014. 4 The WHO did not declare the outbreak to be a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' 5 (PHEIC) until August 8th that year. 6 By this time there were 1779 confirmed and suspected cases of Ebola, nearly a thousand of which were confirmed or suspected to have resulted in death. 7 This delay between the WHO being made aware of the epidemic and declaring it a PHEIC has been the subject of considerable criticism in the literature. 8 Further criticism came via the Report of the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel commissioned by the WHO, which stated that 'significant and unjustifiable delays occurred in the declaration of a PHEIC by the WHO.' 9 The International Health Regulations (IHRs) empower the Director-General of the WHO to declare an event a PHEIC. 10 The IHRs were passed by the World Health Assembly in 2005, as an update to the 1969 Regulations, and serve as the primary set of rules that govern state conduct in the build up to and during infectious disease outbreaks. The overarching goal of the Regulations is to prevent, detect and respond to the international spread of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies, 11 whilst at the same time attempting to prevent unnecessary restrictions being placed upon trade and travel to affected states. 12 The Regulations define a PHEIC as an extraordinary event which is determined: (i) to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and (ii) to potentially require a coordinated international response. 13 The ability to declare an event a Public Health Emergency of International Concern provides the WHO with significant power and influence over international health affairs. First, such a declaration directs international attention and resources to the public health emergency 14 ; this is intended to ensure a fast, coordinated global response to the outbreak. There is, however, a second, negative, element to this influence with the potentia significant impact on travel and trade that a PHEIC can give rise to. 15 As Adam Rainis Houston identifies in his chapter, the concept of a declaring a disease as a PHEIC on the basis of characteristics did not properly exist before the 2005 revisions to the International Health Regulations; rather, only specific diseases (cholera, plague and yellow fever, and smallpox) were considered notifiable under the 1969 IHR. 16 Since 2005 the WHO's mechanisms for determining if an event constituted a PHEIC have been tested on a number of occasions, resulting in a declaration in 2009 for H1N1 pandemic influenza, in 2014 for Polio, in 2016 for Ebola, and in 2016 for Zika, 2018 for Ebola in the DRC and 2019 for Covid-19. Other events-MERS in 2013 and yellow fever in 2016-have been considered potential PHEICs, but have not resulted in declarations. The seemingly inconsistent approach the WHO takes to declaring, or not declaring, an event a PHEIC has resulted in some considerable criticism of the Organisation and its decision-making processes in this area. 17 While the focus of this chapter is on the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, as this is arguably the most controversial use of the WHO's PHEIC powers in the new millennium, it is important to note that our arguments in respect of Ebola are generalisable to other PHEICs. We return to this later in the chapter.",

            "text": "As we have noted elsewhere, the WHO is substantially lacking in appropriate accountability mechanisms, particularly in respect of the actions of the Organisation during a PHEIC. 18 We have also suggested appropriate mechanisms by which the WHO could improve its accountability mechanisms. 19 Accountability and responsibility are inextricably linked: while reform of the accountability system would be of great benefit to the WHO and the international system as a whole, this should be done in combination with development of the international law of responsibility to enable greater redress for wrongful acts when they occur. The law of responsibility enables legal action to be brought against a responsible actor at the international level. 20 As Hafner stated, \"accountability seems to reflect primarily the need to attribute certain activities under international law to such actors as a precondition for imposing on them responsibility under international law.\" 21 Responsibility in international law originally developed in the context of the traditional nature of international law being focused around bilateral state relations and the importance of state sovereignty. If an international legal obligation had been breached then this offended the wronged state's sovereign rights and, consequently, such state should have the ability to reinforce and uphold its rights. Consequently, the law of responsibility was the law of state responsibility. 22 In spite of this early limitation, the ability to apply this law beyond the state was soon being called for. 23 These calls largely arose in response to the growth of international organisations, 18 Belgian nationals New York, 20 February 1965 , No. 7780 (1965 Kent (2005) ; The Secretary'General, Investigation by the Office of Internal Oversight both in terms of number and powers. This eventually led in 2009 to the International Law Commission (ILC) developing the Articles on the Responsibility of International Organisations (ARIO). 24 In spite of the established differences in nature and powers of states and international organisations, 25 the ARIO largely mirror the ILC's earlier Articles on State Responsibility, 26 which are well established within international law. While the principles may largely still be in their infancy in respect of international organisations, there exists a breadth of state-based practice to assist in the interpretation and application of such principles.",

The broad concept of autonomy is a complex one. In existing in this distinct manner, it is only autonomous institutions with this separate will that are capable of incurring legal responsibility. 27 While the overarching idea of autonomy can be a useful one, it is quite broad. A more concrete idea can be found in legal personality, which identifies subjects of international law capable of possessing rights, duties, powers and, crucially, obligations and liabilities of their own accord, and distinct from those of its Member States. 28 This firmer legal concept can be aligned with the idea of identifying a separate will of an organisation; in addressing autonomy and the idea of a distinct Klabbers (2011), at p. 122; Sari (2011) . 28 White (2005) , at p. 31. will, many commentators focus on the presence (or absence) of legal personality. 29 Personality is important not only in identifying a distinct identity on the part of the organisation, but it also in establishing whether an organisation has the capacity to incur responsibility as a distinct actor on the international stage. In spite of personality being slightly more concrete than the overarching idea of autonomy, there does not exist a clear definition of personality in international law. International law is largely state-centric, and states are presumed to have legal personality by their very nature; but the expansion of personality beyond the state has not led to a clear definition.",

The above statement, while utilised by many as a definition, has long been criticised, 31 both in terms of its mention of a 'degree' of personality when such a concept is a discrete one, and also in terms of its circularity. This criticism has given rise to continued debate as to precisely how to establish personality. 32 In spite of the criticism, an engagement with the concepts in the statement, while somewhat difficult, becomes almost inevitable. The important consideration begins with the intentions of member states, primarily those intentions explicitly mentioned but also, building from this, implicitly derived through the actions, powers and organs of the institution in an attempt to identify this broad notion of a 'distinct will'.",

Indeed, the role, functions, and powers of such organisations are organic in nature: they grow, shift and develop over time without a conscious statement of the intentions of the member states that are enabling this growth and development. Many organisations now differ substantially in role, functions, and powers from those which were created in the post-war era, with much of this development having been unconscious and evolutionary as opposed to explicit member state reform. The consequence is that, to identify personality, intentions are inferred from considering aspects of the institution: such as a degree of permanency and distinct purposes and powers, the existence of organs within the institution with the 29 White (2005) , at p. 30. 30 Reparations for injuries suffered in the service of the United Nations, Advisory Opinion ICJ Reports, 1949 , p. 179. 31 Br\u00f6lmann (2007 , at p. 78; White (2005) , at p. 44. 32 Seyersted (1964) , Klabbers (1998) , see in particular, 243-249; Klabbers and Wallendahl (2011). capacity for decision making, and the exercise of powers, without the prior approval of the member states. 33 Determining the WHO's personality is slightly more complex than with some other institutions due to its existence as a specialised agency of the UN. 34 As with most other international organisations, there is no definitive statement on personality in its founding documents, meaning there was no distinct conferral of personality on the WHO from the Member States at the time of its creation. The Reparations statement then directs us to consider a more implicit conferral of personality from the Member States; when considering the powers and capacities given to an institution, personality can be identified.",

            "text": "The considerable expansion of the role, functions, and powers of the WHO since they were first articulated in 1946 only strengthens the case for establishing legal personality and determining the WHO as an autonomous institution. The Member States have allowed the role, functions and powers of the WHO to move its personality beyond that which was initially envisaged in the founding of the organisation. In the 33 White (2005) words of the ICJ opinion in Reparations this can only be explained by the possession of international personality, and a capacity to operate upon an international plane. 39 While some progress on this argument can be made in relation to the initial idea of will and powers, further support can be found in the institutional structure of the WHO: it possesses its own organs. Under its auspices exist the World Health Assembly, the Executive Board, and the Secretariat, each of which has a number of distinct powers to act on behalf of the WHO. The Assembly, for example, determines policies and adopts regulations, which can be seen as akin to a legislative process. It is also able to adopt conventions with respect to the objectives of the WHO. The Executive Board exists as an executive organ of the Health Assembly, although it must be noted that it has some degree of independence from the Assembly, and thereby from the Member States that make up the Assembly. For instance, while membership of the Board is elected by the Assembly, the Board does not need to reflect the national membership of the Assembly, 40 implying that the Board members are acting in a manner that is institutionally distinct from the Assembly and the Member States. Moreover, the Board elects its own Chair and sets its own rules and procedures, 41 addresses any questions within its competence, 42 sets the agenda for the Assembly, 43 and proposes the general programme of work for the Assembly to vote upon. 44 Each of these powers and duties of the Board implies that it is distinct from the Assembly and the decision-making powers of the Member States that make up the Assembly. Most notably in this regard however, is the fact that the Board has the power to take emergency measures within the functions and financial resources of the Organisation to deal with events requiring immediate action. In particular it may authorise the Director-General to take the necessary steps to combat epidemics, to participate in the organisation of health relief to victims of a calamity and to undertake studies and research the urgency of which has been drawn to the attention of the Board by any Member or by the Director-General. 45 While the Board typically exists to work in harmony with the Assembly, and the Member States that comprise it, it is clear that it has some degree of independence, particularly when responding to epidemics and calamities such as Ebola. The existence of distinct organs in this fashion begins to give further credence to the existence of personality on the part of the WHO. While the existence of organs in themselves may not be a determining factor, their distinct identity as providing much more than a simple discussion forum for Member States can contribute towards the argument of an institution possessing personality. When considering the WHO's organs, they exist as part of the institution and, most particularly, do so during epidemics the 39 Reparations for injuries suffered in the service of the United Nations, Advisory Opinion ICJ Reports, 1949, p. 179. 40 Article 25, Constitution of the World Health Organisation. 41 Article 27, Constitution of the World Health Organisation. 42 Article 28(h), Constitution of the World Health Organisation. 43 Article 28(f), Constitution of the World Health Organisation. 44 Article 28(g), Constitution of the World Health Organisation. 45 Article 28(i), Constitution of the World Health Organisation. management and prevention of which is one of the key functions of the Organisation itself. 46 When considering further powers of the WHO, its ability to accede to international treaties also gives particular credence to an existence of legal personality. It is particularly telling that the WHO acceded to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in spite of the existing accession of many of its Member States. 47 The report of the Secretariat of the Executive Board on the Participation by the WHO to the Vienna Convention is interesting in this respect. 48 In this Report, drafted by the Secretariat, the Executive Board of the WHO advises the WHA to authorise the Director-General of the WHO to sign the Convention. This Report clearly discusses the WHO as an actor distinct from its Member States. Indeed, many Member States of the WHA were already signatories to the Convention by this stage, the implication being that the membership of its Member States was insufficient to bind the WHO to the Convention, and accession by the WHO as a distinct legal actor was required. This led to the WHO signing the Convention in 1987 and giving formal confirmation of its intention to be bound, without reservations, in 2000. 49 All of these points show that the WHO has the capacity to act in a distinct fashion that is beyond the sum of its parts; it is more than simply a collective of its Member States. In existing in this distinct manner and having certain rights, powers and obligations as this distinct actor, it clearly possesses legal personality. The WHO's legal personality gives it both the capacity to act in certain areas within its remit, but also makes it 'subject to international law', giving rise to the need to provide redress for any issues arising from its actions, or omissions, in the areas within its competence. It has the capacity for legal responsibility arising from its powers. In order to consider any possibility of legal responsibility, however, the existence of obligations over and above powers to act must first of all be found.",

It must first of all be noted that when examining the IHR and the obligation to declare a PHEIC, that the language used is not that of the discretionary 46 'may', but of the obligatory 'shall'. As noted above, a PHEIC can only be declared by the Director-General, 51 on the advice of an Emergency Committee, which is convened by the Director-General. 52 The decision to declare (or not to declare, as the case may be) an event a PHEIC is one that has significant repercussions for affected states. While the International Health Regulations provides the Director-General with the power to declare an extraordinary event a PHEIC, we argue that the Director-General actually has a legal obligation to declare an event a PHEIC and to do so in a timely manner. The first element of this obligation to declare may have been eventually fulfilled but (as we will argue in a moment), the failure to declare the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak a PHEIC in a timely fashion was not, and therefore constitutes an internationally wrongful act, for which responsibility ought to arise on the part of the Organisation.",

While this is a broad Function of the Organisation, and in and of itself it cannot be said to confer upon the WHO specific and particular obligations in respect of declaring a PHEIC in a timely manner, when taken in combination with the two further Functions outlined below, a compelling case can be made that there is an obligation binding upon the WHO to declare a PHEIC, and to do so in a timely manner. The first additional relevant function outlined at 2(a) of the Constitution outlines that the WHO is 'to act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work'. 61 The WHO's role as directing and coordinating authority during a major outbreak such as Ebola is typically triggered by a declaration of a PHEIC by the WHO. Article 13 of the IHR states that a PHEIC Declaration being made triggers the following response from WHO: 57 For an interesting historical perspective on the development of the Constitution see: Grad (2002 Further, if the WHO considers that a PHEIC is occurring it can assess the severity of the event, the adequacy of support, and offer additional assistance: Such collaboration may include the offer to mobilise [sic] international assistance in order to support the national authorities in conducting and coordinating on-site assessments. 63 This process of having the WHO coordinate and direct the response to an outbreak is crucial in ensuring an effective response from the affected states and the wider international community. A PHEIC declaration triggers the mechanisms of the WHO into action, and also directs international attention and resources to the outbreak. A consequence of this is that any PHEIC declaration must be done in a timely fashion. A PHEIC works to direct and coordinate action in response to an outbreak, and so a failure to act in a timely fashion will affect the ability to respond to a crisis. This can be seen with comments by the Report of the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel that during the Ebola outbreak the 'WHO not only coordinates the health cluster, but is also responsible for the coordination of specific technical activities such as surveillance. In the Ebola crisis, WHO should have had a key role to play in coordination, but it took a long time to get this started.' 64 The second relevant function of the WHO that could give rise to there being an obligation to declare a PHEIC in a timely fashion is 'to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases'. 65 Clearly this cannot be adequately achieved without the timely declaration of a PHEIC by the Director-General. As noted above, a PHEIC declaration not only triggers the mechanisms of the WHO, but also directs international attention and resources to the outbreak-resources that are key to controlling or eradicating disease.",

A PHEIC declaration is clearly a central tool through which this obligation is fulfilled. Not only is there a general obligation to declare a PHEIC when appropriate in a timely fashion, but the WHO-AU Agreement created an obligation upon the WHO to do as much as possible to contain disease outbreaks in African Union Member States which would clearly include declaring a PHEIC where appropriate.

There are numerous practical limitations to finding and giving effect to any determination of responsibility in relation to an international organisation like the WHO. Not only is there a question about a lack of judicial fora before which cases on breach of international law by international organisations could be brought, but there is also the question of practical consequences arising from actions before such courts, if one with appropriate jurisdiction could be identified. A determination of responsibility gives rise to an obligation to make reparation. 76 The extent to which this is possible in the present case, both in terms of enforcement, and of where any money would be drawn from in order to make such reparation, is highly questionable. Regarding enforcement, there does not exist an identifiable court before which the WHO could be taken by a state, or indeed an individual or institution affected by the WHO's omissions in the present case, to enforce the determination of responsibility. This is one of the fundamental weaknesses of responsibility in relation to international organisations; there are few, if any, possibilities in terms of judicial fora. When considering the case law that has discussed the principles contained in the ARIO, it is notable that all of them return to the responsibility of a state, after engaging with the ARIO principles in respect of the relevant institutions in order to 'discount' the institution concerned, return to the responsibility of the states concerned. 77 It is difficult to conceive of a case where the responsibility of an institution could be explicitly determined and later enforced. This is all before considering the difficult question of immunity, which is a principle that has continued to block numerous cases considering the responsibility of the United Nations. 78 While there are questions about the existence and nature of institutions' immunity, including discussions about whether they are absolute or limited, most consider the UN to possess an absolute immunity from prosecution in line with Article 105(1) of the UN Charter, together with section two of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations (1946), which states:",

With the questions arising in relation to national law, immunity arises time and again. Furthermore, the WHO constitution states that [t] he Organisation shall enjoy in the territory of each Member such privileges and immunities as may be necessary for the fulfillment of its objective and for the exercise of its functions. The UN General Assembly concluded the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialised Agencies that explicitly included the WHO within its remit. 82 Although the International Court of Justice is seemingly given some remit for action by the Constitution of the WHO, and also specifically within the Convention on Privileges and Immunities, this is substantially limited when read together with provisions of the Statute of the ICJ. Only states are able to be parties to adversarial proceedings before that Court. 83 Any proceedings involving international organisations can only be heard by the Court in the remit of an advisory opinion, in respect of interpreting international law, not enforcing it. Overall, it appears that the ability to establish responsibility judicially is highly limited; the remit of the ICJ is restricted and all attempts to bring cases in national courts have resulted in immunity preventing any action proceeding against the international organisation. While there have been some limited examples of litigants looking beyond immunity where not to do so would lead to a 'denial of justice', 84 this appears to be a highly limited approach largely addressing private law cases; cases beyond this in the sphere of public law have seen continual deference to immunity, in particular in relation to the United Nations. 85 In the present case, the WHO is privilege to the same immunity and protection from legal action as the UN.",

            "text": "The funding of reparation is a more complex issue that returns, again, to the difficult nature of the identity of an international organisation. Institutions are dependent for their budget upon their member states, and a call for reparation raises a number of difficulties. It must be considered whether the institution would pay for such reparations out of its general budget, or whether it would be feasible for it to call upon member states to contribute to a special fund in order to fulfill its reparation obligations. The difficulties surrounding this can be seen with the issues arising from the outbreak of cholera in Haiti, and the attempt by the UN to set up a compensation fund in response to the outbreak 86 : there continues to be uncertainty surrounding how this fund will be paid for. The UN has sought to address two main parts within this fund, one aspect being compensation for the victims and another being about eradication and prevention. There is a target for $200 million for each of these parts. 87 However, it was initially unclear whether this should be funded from the general budget or from member state contributions. The approach eventually taken by the UN was to rely upon voluntary donations from member states. The consequence of this was that the fund never reached anywhere near $400 million, and is currently at risk of running out completely. 88 While it is important to ensure that the WHO follows its international obligations, it is questionable whether the imposition of legal responsibility, without immunity, would be effective in encouraging the WHO to engage in its role at the global level. If there arises a concern that its actions may result in determinations of responsibility, this may result in a more cautious approach by the WHO out of fear of liability being imposed through the law of responsibility. This may end up amounting to a disincentive on the part of the institution to act and develop. Even where an institution has developed a significant amount of autonomy, it remains dependent upon its Member States for expansion and development. If the consequence of developing an institution has been that Member States have been subjected to greater requirements for payment and effective obligations for reparations then this will only discourage the development here. There are huge potential benefits in the development of institutional frameworks and the ability that they have to address global issues, such as that of global health and, in this circumstance, epidemic and pandemic emergencies. It has to be asked whether a framework that may prove a disincentive on the part of states to act and enable global action is really the best approach here. Not only did the practical limitations to imposing liability on the WHO for the mismanagement of the PHEIC declaration during the West African Ebola outbreak serve to shut down any discussion of legal restitution from the WHO, but an opportunity to acknowledge the situation and make a step towards remedying it was lost.",

Furthermore, the WHO has developed to face a number of obligations, as well as powers. However, this development has not been accompanied with any development of the WHO's internal accountability mechanisms, 89 nor any meaningful engagement with external accountability and responsibility mechanisms. Since the 2005 revisions to the International Health Regulations, the manner in which the WHO has responded to a number of PHEICs, and potential PHEICs, has been subject to considerable criticism from member states and the academic literature. 90 It is our contention that on at least one occasion the WHO, in responding to an extraordinary event that likely constitutes a PHEIC, has breached its legal obligations to declare such an event a PHEIC in a 88 See: United Nations (2017) . 89 Eccleston-Turner and McArdle (2017) . 90 see (n 8). timely manner.

It applies equally to any other extraordinary event where the criteria for declaring a PHEIC have been met. This area becomes further complicated when we consider not only the timely declaration of a PHEIC as being an international legal obligation for which responsibility can be attributed to the WHO, but also the appropriate, timely downgrading of a PHEIC's status once the extraordinary event no longer meets the criteria to be considered a PHEIC. This again, is a decision that is delegated to the Director-General via the IHR, and one that has been subject to criticism for its usage. 91 It is arguable that not only is the timely declaration of a PHEIC a legal obligation binding upon the WHO, but also that the timely and appropriate downgrading of a PHEIC amounts to a legal obligation binding upon the WHO (though the full development of that point is beyond the scope of this chapter).",

A legal determination of responsibility in a judicial setting remains highly unlikely. Therefore, a productive move forward would be a clear and unequivocal acknowledgement of wrongdoing on the part of WHO when mistakes are made and the further development of accountability mechanisms. While this is highly limited, and the examples that do exist of institutions acknowledging wrongdoing have a number of substantial flaws, 92 the possibility exists for institutions such as the WHO to develop internal mechanisms that work and allow some redress.
