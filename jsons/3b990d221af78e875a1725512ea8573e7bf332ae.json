In the absence of a culture system for HEV, the ORF1 expressed using bacterial and mammalian expression systems has shown an ~186 kDa protein, but no processing of the polyprotein has been observed. Based on these observations, it was proposed that the ORF1 polyprotein does not undergo processing into functional units. We have studied ORF1 polyprotein expression and processing through a baculovirus expression vector system because of the high level expression and post-translational modification abilities of this system.",

Based on protein sequence homology, the ORF1 polyprotein is proposed to contain four putative domains indicative of methyltransferase (MeT), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), RNA Helicase (Hel), and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Fig.  1 ) [12] . Of these, the MeT and RdRp enzymatic activities have been demonstrated [13, 14] while activities of the Hel and PCP have so far not been elucidated. Attempts have also been made to study ORF1 processing using different expression systems. In one study, the ~186 kDa ORF1 polyprotein was expressed through recombinant vaccinia virus infection of mammalian cells, but no processed products were initially observed [15] . Following extended incubation for 24-36 hours, two processed bands of ~107 and ~78 kDa were observed. Mutagenesis of the proposed cysteine protease domain of ORF1 suggested that the HEV protease had no role in ORF1 polyprotein processing. The cleavage of the ~186 kDa protein was attributed either to a vaccinia-virus encoded protease or a cellular protease.",

Since no other smaller products were observed, ORF1 processing did not seem to occur in the prokaryotic system. When the expression of ORF1 was studied by carrying out in vitro coupled transcription and translation, a polyprotein of 186 kDa could again be immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the various putative domains of ORF1, but no smaller fragments were observed. The expression in transiently transfected HepG2 cells also resulted in a ~186 kDa protein, but no other smaller sized fragments were seen [16] . Transfection of an in vitro generated infectious full-length HEV RNA into HepG2 cells has also been used to assess ORF1 expression and processing [17] .

This could be due to improper folding of the GST-ORF1 fusion protein expressed in the prokaryotic system, and low yields of the protein expressed in coupled in vitro transcription-translation or mammalian expression systems. To address this, we expressed a recombinant ORF1 polyprotein tagged at its N-and C-termini in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system, and detected the processed fragments using antibodies specific for the N-terminal hexa-histidine and C-terminal FLAG epitopes. Using this strategy, we show here that the ORF1 polyprotein is processed in insect cells and that this involves both cysteine and noncysteine proteases. The processing of ORF1 was also confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of one of the processed fragments and by western blotting with antibodies to the methyltransferase domain.",

This was expected since MeT is the N-terminal domain of ORF1, and is closest to the His-tag in this construct. To further check the authenticity of processing, we performed a kinetic study of the protein expression following recombinant baculovirus infection. The ~192 kDa tagged polyprotein and at least two smaller fragments of 98 and 47 kDa appeared faintly at 24 hpi. This indicated rapid, possibly cotranslational processing since the polyhedrin promoter, under which ORF1 is placed, gets activated at around 24 hpi. The polyprotein synthesis and appearance of the processed products increased at 48 hpi and subsequent times in agreement with the characteristics of this expression system. At later times, smaller N-terminal fragments of 35 and 22 kDa were also found. This represents a precursor-product relationship, indicative of polyprotein processing.

This suggested that cysteine protease sites occurred at 22, 35, and 98 kDa, while a non-cysteine protease site occurred at 47 kDa from the N-terminus of the tagged ORF1 polyprotein. When probed from the C-terminus with anti-FLAG antibodies, the E-64d treated cells exhibited strong accumulation of the ~192 kDa polyprotein, as well as fragments of 122 and 26 kDa. This meant that non-cysteine protease sites existed at these distances from the C-terminus of the tagged ORF1 polyprotein, while cysteine protease sites were present around 106, 93 and 59 kDa from the C-terminal end. The ~22 kDa N-terminal fragment disrupts the MeT coding region. From the present analysis, it is not clear whether this is due to nonspecific activity of the HEV protease or due to a host cell cysteine protease. Similarly, an ~26 kDa C-terminal fragment that disrupts the RdRp region is the likely product of a non-cysteine host protease. Though our results do not unequivocally prove the cysteine protease activity to have a viral origin, we clearly demonstrate ORF1 polyprotein processing.

This has led Ropp et al [15] to speculate that the proposed cysteine protease within the HEV nonstructural polyprotein is non-functional and that HEV is different from all other positive-strand RNA viruses with respect to the processing of its nonstructural polyprotein. This has important implications for the classification of HEV within the positive-strand RNA virus group. Three lines of evidence argue against this possibility. First, using an infectious molecular clone of HEV, Panda et al [17] were able to detect proteins smaller than the 185 kDa ORF1 polyprotein with antisera prepared against recombinant methyltransferase, helicase and RdRp domains expressed in bacteria. Secondly, a 37 kDa protein identified with anti-HEV RdRp antibodies was observed in cells transfected with the HEV ORF1-EGFP replicon [29] . We present the third line of evidence in this study by demonstrating that the ORF1 polyprotein is capable of being processed and that a cysteine protease is partly responsible for this. We do understand that the baculovirus-mediated expression system employed in this study is not the natural expression system for HEV. It was used here because of our apprehension that earlier failures to observe ORF1 processing were either due to improper folding of the polyprotein expressed in prokaryotic systems, or due to low levels of expression in transfected mammalian cells. The baculovirus system offered the advantage of high expression levels and close to native post-translational modifications and protein conformation.",

Besides other components, the reaction mix included 20 pmoles of each primer and 1 mM Mg(OAc) 2 . The amplification primers were designed based on alignments of the 5' and 3' ends of ORF1 in the HEV genomic sequence (GenBank Accession Number AF459438) [30] . The primers used for the amplification were EcoRI-ORF1-5', TACGGAATTCATGGAGGCCCAT-CAGTTTATCAAG and Hind III-ORF1-3', CCAAAGCTTT-GATTTCACCCGACACAAGATTGA, containing the underlined restriction sites. The PCR amplified fragment was initially cloned in the TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen). To position a FLAG tag at the 3'end of ORF1, the FLAG epitope was first reconstructed by annealing the oligonucleotides AGCTTAACTACAAGGACGACGACGATAAG-TAACTCGAG and TCGACTCGAGTTACTTATCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTC-CATA. The annealed product was ligated with the vector pBBHis-2b (Invitrogen) at its HindIII and SalI sites. The PCR-amplified ORF1 fragment with EcoRI and HindIII ends was then cloned into this modified vector. The recombinant vector, pBB-ORF1 so generated, contained ORF1 flanked by hexahistidine and FLAG tags at its 5' and 3' ends respectively in a continuous reading frame (Fig. 1) . The insert was sequenced to confirm the junction sequences and the translation frame before using this transfer vector for generating the recombinant baculovirus. The procedure used to construct the recombinant ORF1 baculovirus, vORF1 was essentially the same as suggested for the Bac-N-Blue DNA Transfection kit (Invitrogen). Essentially, 4 \u00b5g of recombinant plasmid (pBB-ORF1) was incubated with 0.5 \u00b5g of Bac-N-blue-DNA and Celfectin reagent (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 20 min for the formation of the DNA-liposome complex. This mixture was overlayed on Sf21 cells in 60 mm dishes in serum-free medium and was incubated for 4 hrs at 27\u00b0C. Following transfection, 1 ml of complete TNM-FH medium was added and incubated further at 27\u00b0C for 72 h. Recombinant virus was harvested by collecting the medium and subsequently used for two rounds of plaque purification followed by the recombinant virus amplification as described earlier [31] . This stock of virus called vORF1 was used for infection of T. ni cells to express ORF1 for studying its processing.",

Western blotting with anti-His antibody revealed that addition of E-64d resulted in loss of the processed 98, 35 and 22 kDa fragments, while there was accumulation of the 47 kDa fragment at both time points(Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). Under the same conditions and at similar times all processed fragments were observed in untreated cells (Fig. 3A lanes 1 and 3 respectively), while none of the fragments were seen in cells infected with the wt virus (Fig. 3A lanes 5 and 6). Equal amounts of proteins were loaded in E-64d treated, untreated or wt virus infected cells, as seen on Coomassie Expression and processing of the ORF1 polyprotein Figure 2 Expression and processing of the ORF1 polyprotein. T. ni cells infected with the vORF1 recombinant virus were harvested at various times post-infection and the lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting with anti-His (A) or anti-FLAG (B) antibodies. Lanes 1 to 5 show results at 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hr post-infection; lane 6 shows the result for wild type AcMNPV infection after 48 hr. Panel C shows the 48 hr lysate probed with anti-MeT antibodies. In (B) the upper and lower panels show results from 7.5% and 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The estimated fragment sizes are shown based on molecular size markers run on each gel (not shown).",
