The main disadvantage of HPAs is their very low surface area (<10 m2/g) [6]. Therefore, to address this problem, in many earlier articles these materials disperse on supports (such as silica, active carbon, acidic ion-exchange resins and etc.) which possess large surface area. Support disperses HPAs over a large surface area and increases their catalytic activity [7\u201313].",

Although these methods are valuable, however, many of these procedures have significant drawbacks such as using of surfactant and other chemical reagent, long reaction times and poly-dispersity of particle size. In this study we synthesized nano HPAs by a simple, repaid, inexpensive and one step solvothermal method. Solvothermal synthesis is generally defined as crystal synthesis or crystal growth under high temperature and high pressure solvent conditions from substances which are insoluble in ordinary temperature and pressure (<100 \u00b0C, <1 atm) in an autoclave. Thus, supercritical condition gives a favorable reaction field for particle formation, owing to the enhancement of the reaction rate and large super saturation based on the nucleation theory, due to lowering the solubility. Then as-synthesized nanostructures were characterized by several characterization methods such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analyzer. Thermal stability of nanoparticles was studied by thermal gravimeter analyse (TGA). For perception of particle size on acidity of the HPAs, the prepared nanoparticles were investigated by pyridine adsorption method. Results indicate that decreasing in particle size of HPAs will increase acidity.",

Pyridinium ions can be identified by the band at 1,540 cm\u22121 [24]. The characteristic chemisorbed pyridium ion was detected after the removal of physisorbed pyridine from HPAs by evacuation. The P\u2013O*, W=Ot (terminal oxygen), and W\u2013O\u2013W (corner sharing and edge-sharing) bands of pyridine-exposed PWAn (PWAn-Py) appeared at 1,034, 942, 839 and 737 cm\u22121, respectively. Shifting of IR bands of pyridine-exposed HPAs were attributed to the interaction of the cationic species, pyridinium ions, with the heteropolyanions. Also, the FT-IR analyses of pyridine-exposed PWAb, PMAb and PMAn are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3. The quantification of bridging oxygen bands was not simple. Thus, the absorption band correspond to the Mo=Ot or W=Ot stretch might be expected to track the extent of proton transfer upon interaction with basic molecules such as pyridine. The acidic properties of PMA and PWA are measured by the IR intensity of pyridium ion at 1,540 cm\u22121 of the pyridine-exposed PMA and PWA and calculated the intensity ratio of I(1,540 cm\u22121) to I(Mo=Ot or W=Ot) bands.
