The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA1) has established new guidelines for testing vaccines and therapeutics of select agents\u2014those pathogens that the government has determined are potential biological weapons. Because the actual risk of infection via a bioterrorist attack is not known, and because naturally occurring infections are quite rare, it is neither ethical nor practical to perform the usual phase 1, 2, and 3 trials. The ability to determine efficacy would be prohibitively expensive because most bioterror agents occur very rarely in nature and our ability to determine efficacy would take years. For this reason, FDA has ruled that stockpiles of vaccines and therapeutics can be generated if the treatment has been determined to be effective in two different animal models. Certainly at least one of the animal models should be a nonhuman primate. Below is a description of the select agents and other emerging pathogens that are likely to require the use of nonhuman primates.",

Numerous species have been used, including baboons, African green monkeys, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques; and the pathology is similar to the infections observed in humans. It will be difficult to conduct vaccine clinical trials in humans for any EBOV vaccines because of the sporadic nature of the outbreaks and the potential ethical difficulty in obtaining approvals. The relatively rare appearance of EBOV does not favor normal development of a commercially viable vaccine. However, this view changes with the newer, existing threats of bioterrorism. If a vaccine became available, it would most likely be given to medical personnel and first responders, similar to those identified at risk from a smallpox attack. It has become clear that rodent models are not necessarily predictive for efficacy of antivirals and other therapeutics, so the gold standard will remain the nonhuman primate trials (Feldmann et al. 2003; Jahrling et al. 1996). In fact, in a vaccine efficacy study in nonhuman primates, it was demonstrated that vaccine strategies successful in rodents were not able to protect primates from a 1000-plaque forming unit challenge of virus (Geisbert et al. 2002).",

In some areas of Sierra Leone, the disease accounts for 30% of medical in-hospital deaths, 30% of deafness, and 70% of spontaneous abortion. Transmission from rodents to humans is believed to be by inhalation. Nosocomial spread of LAV also takes place in hospitals.

Hantaviruses have been found to be widespread thoughout North and South America (Snell 2003). Andes virus was the first known hantavirus to show human-to-human spread; all of the other hantaviruses are rodent borne (Vitek et al. 1996). Because Andes virus has not been well studied, the probability of this agent being used as a biological weapon is unknown. Recently, nonhuman primates were used in attempts to understand the pathogenesis of the virus and the mechanisms of protection (McElroy et al. 2002). It was demonstrated that cynomologous macaques, although not manifesting clinical disease, did manifest lymphocyte decrease during infection (McElroy et al. 2002). In addition, it was determined that antibodies generated in rhesus macaques against the Andes G1 and G2 protected Syrian hamsters from lethal challenge, which provided insight into potential postexposure treatment (Custer et al. 2003).",

The virus caused encephalitis in infected humans, with up to 40% mortality (Lam and Chua 2002). Currently, no prophylaxis or vaccine exists for Nipah. However, the antiviral ribavirin, which was used as an empirical therapy in infected patients, has been reported to be effective, although it has yet to be fully evaluated in animal experiments (Chong et al. 2001). There is a hamster animal model, in which animals die of acute encephalitis following Nipah virus infection (Guillaume et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2003). The model has shown that passive transfer of antibody from immunized animals protects them from a lethal Nipah virus challenge. In humans, both relapsing and late-onset cases of infection have been observed (Lim et al. 2003; Tan et al. 2002; Wong et al. 2001). In the situations described above, the immunobiology of the infection is unknown. None of these late pathologies have been observed in the hamster model (Guillaume et al. 2004). In Bangladesh, there is a current outbreak of Nipah (H. Feldmann, Canadian Center for Human and Animal Health, Winnipeg, Manitoba, personal communication, 2004), which has been shown to have nosocomial transmissibility (Tan and Tan 2001).",

Nonhuman primate research has provided valuable insight into the role of interferon in limiting disease severity (Cosgriff et al. 1989; Morrill et al. 1990, 1991).

Lethal toxin and edema toxin exert their effect when they bind the receptor-binding component (PA) of the A-B type toxin (Pezard et al. 1991). In fact, vaccination strategies have targeted PA in immune responses to prevent coupling of the effector toxin to the receptor-binding component (Welkos et al. 2001).

However, the increasing difficulty in obtaining animals for research has led to the need to develop another model that can sufficiently mimic human infection. Attempts have been made to establish rabbit models and other small animals for inhalation anthrax (Welkos et al. 2001; Zaucha et al. 1998), but nonhuman primate models continue to be needed for vaccine efficacy testing and other therapeutic testing. For instance, a survey of the efficacy of the anthrax vaccine adsorbed anthrax vaccine among guinea pigs, rabbits, and rhesus macaques resulted in variable protection when challenged with B. anthracis from diverse geographical origins (Fellows et al. 2001). Recent studies have shown that cynomologus macaques exhibit pathology similar to that seen in humans and rhesus monkeys (Vasconcelos et al. 2003).",

The natural reservoir includes small mammals such as ground squirrels, hares, voles, muskrats, water rats, rabbits, and other rodents (Grunow et al. 2000). This agent is spread to humans from infected reservoirs and other small vertebrates through direct contact or transmission from an arthropod vector.

Researchers identified two variants (blue and gray colony types) in the Soviet's vaccine strain. Immunization of guinea pigs with the blue variant resulted in increased resistance to lethal challenge (Eigelsbach and Downs 1961). Ultimately, the current live vaccine strain (LVS1) was derived from this variant, and its efficacy was tested in human volunteers (Saslaw et al. 1961). Because the basis of the LVS attenuation has not been determined, as well as lack of data regarding the characterization of the immune response, the vaccine is not currently available in the Unites States.

In addition, phase variation appears to play a role in sustaining the viability of the organism within macrophages. Variation in LPS, specifically the O antigen and lipid A, reduces nitric oxide production and permits bacterial growth within macrophages (Cowley et al. 1996). A final known virulence determinant is an ABC transporter encoded on the valA gene, which is essential for macrophage growth (Cowley et al. 1996).",

The agent causes several forms of the disease, namely bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plague. Bubonic plague is characterized by swollen tender lymph glands, fever, headache, and chills, and occurs when the bacteria are transmitted by an arthropod vector or when Y. pestis contaminated material enters the body through a break in the skin (Hull et al. 1987; von Reyn et al. 1977). Septicemic plague, which results when bacteria multiply in the blood, may be a complication of bubonic or pneumonic plague (Hull et al. 1987). In addition to the symptoms seen with bubonic plague, septicemic patients also present with abdominal pain, shock, and hemorrhaging into skin and internal organs (Hull et al. 1987). Finally, pneumonic plague is the contagious form of the disease that is spread through aerosolized bacteria (Doll et al. 1994; Meyer 1961). It is characterized by rapidly developing pneumonia, shortness of breath, cough and chest pain. Infected individuals must be treated within 24 hr to prevent a fatal outcome.",

One vaccine is an attenuated strain of Y. pestis, and the other is a killed vaccine originally developed in the United States in the early 1940s (Meyer 1970; Williams et al. 1980). The vaccine is usually given only to those at risk for encountering a highly pathogenic strain, such as military troops and researchers. Despite the availability of a vaccine, there is interest in developing an improved vaccine because of major disadvantages with current vaccines. Previously, only a sparse number of studies have used African green monkeys and vervets in vaccine and pathogenesis studies of the plague (Chen et al. 1976, 1977; Davis et al. 1996). As new vaccine candidates are identified, the need for a nonhuman primate model will certainly increase.",

Smaller primates such as the marmoset may become very important for these studies, because space is very limited for primates in BSL-3 and -4 facilities. Unfortunately, although the amount of funding for biodefense-related research provided through regional centers of excellence and other funding sources at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has exponentially increased the interest in select agent research, only a small fraction has been provided to primate resources, and it is inadequate to deal with all of the vaccines and therapies being developed. Yet the development of nonhuman primate models continues to be critical to ensure that the true utility of infectious disease research will be of value to a population at risk of bioterrorism and infectious diseases.",
