With the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019-nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.",

In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.",

Until last year, six strains of coronaviruses that are able to infect humans have been identified [1, 2] . Among them, four human coronaviruses, including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoVHKU1, are not highly pathogenic and only cause mild respiratory diseases [1] . However, two other coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3] [4] [5] [6] and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [7, 8] , have caused two large-scale pandemics and resulted in more than 8000 cases including nearly 800 related deaths and about 2500 cases including about 860 related deaths, respectively. The outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV showed that some coronaviruses can be highly-pathogenic viruses when they transmit to humans from animals [9] . Therefore, it is urgent to develop antiviral treatments or vaccines targeting such high-risk coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",

The full-length genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was soon determined by the Zhang group [15] . It was revealed that 2019-nCoV has a probable bat origin and is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat SARS-like coronavirus [16] . In addition, 2019-nCoV is also closely related to other SARS-like coronaviruses and shares 79.5% sequence identify to SARS-CoV [16] . For some encoded proteins like coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the sequence identity is even higher and can be as high as 96% between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV [17] .

            "text": "Coronaviruses uses the surface spike (S) glycoprotein on the envelope to attach host cells and mediate host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection [19] . The spike protein includes two regions, S1 and S2, where S1 is for host cell receptor binding and S2 is for membrane fusion. The S1 region also includes an N-terminal domain (NTD) and three C-terminal domains (CTD1, CTD2, and CTD3) [21] . For SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain (RBD) is located in the CTD1 of the S1 region. SARS-CoV attaches the human host cells through the binding of the RBD protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) [20] . Therefore, the interaction between RBD and ACE2 is a prerequisite for the human infection with SARS-CoV. Given the high homology between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, it was expected that 2019-nCoV would also use the ACE2 molecule as the receptor to entry human cells [18] . This hypothesis was further experimentally confirmed by the virus infectivity studies from the Shi group, in which 2019-nCoV is able to use the ACE2 proteins from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats, and civet as an entry receptor in the ACE2expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2 [16] . Xu et al. have used MOE to calculate the binding free energies between the RBD of spike protein and human ACE2, showing that the binding free energy between 2019-nCoV and human ACE2 was \u221250.6 kcal/mol, whereas that between SARS-CoV and human ACE2 was \u221278.6 kcal/mol [18] . Very recently, the Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike protein in the prefusion conformation has been determined [22] . The biophysical and structural evidence suggested that 2019-nCoV binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV [22] .",

Many questions remain to be answered. For example, previous studies showed that the binding affinity between 2019-nCoV and human ACE2 is weaker than that between SARS-CoV and human ACE2 [18] . However, in reality, 2019-nCoV has resulted in many more cases and seems to be more infectious than SARS-CoV. In this study, we have extensively investigated the spike protein/human ACE2 protein systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV by using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Specifically, we have extensively studied the free energies and dynamics of RBD-ACE2 binding, spike protein, and free RBD systems. Given that the spike protein is not only a potential drug target but also the virus antigen, the present study will be beneficial for the drug design, vaccine development, and disease prevention for 2019-nCoV.",

For SARS-CoV, the RBD-ACE2 complex structure was directly downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry: 3SCI) [23] . Then, all the water molecules were removed from the complex structure. The free RBD structure was obtained by removing the ACE2 protein from the RBD-ACE2 complex. The structure of the trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV was also downloaded from the PDB (PDB entry: 6ACD) [21] . For 2019-nCoV, the three dimensional (3D) RBD structure was modeled based on the RBD structure of SARS-CoV using the MODELLER program [24] , where the sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalW program [25, 26] .

Last, the binding modes were ranked according to their binding energy scores, and the top ten binding modes were provided to users. During the docking calculation, all the default parameters were used. Namely, the grid spacing was set to 1.2\u00c5 for 3D translational search, the angle interval was set to 15 \u2022 for rotational sampling in 3D Euler space, the binding interface information in the PDB was automatically applied during the modeling of individual structures.

For the RBD of 2019-nCoV, there are 13 hydrophobic residues at the binding site, which are comparable to 13 hydrophobic residues for that of SARS-CoV ( Figure 1B ).",

The binding free energies were calculated using the MM-GBSA model by the \"MMPBSA.py\" script in the AMBER package. Table 1 shows a comparison of the RBD-ACE2 binding free energies for 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. It can be seen from the table that the binding free energy of the RBD-ACE2 interaction for 2019-nCoV is \u221250.43 kcal/mol, which is significantly lower than the binding free energy of the RBD-ACE2 interaction for SARS-CoV (\u221236.75 kcal/mol). In other words, 2019-nCoV binds human ACE2 with a significantly higher affinity than SARS-CoV. This result is consistent with the current fact that 2019-CoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. Very recently, experimental studies also showed that 2019-CoV could bind human ACE2 with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV [22] . Further examination of the binding free energy contributions reveals that the higher binding affinity of 2019-nCoV than SARS-CoV is mostly attributed to the solvation energy contribution \u2206G solv (674.97 vs. 696.56 kcal/mol), whereas 2019-nCoV has a higher binding free energy in vacuum \u2206G gas than SARS-CoV (-725.41 vs. -733.31). In other words, 2019-nCoV tends to bind human ACE2 better than SARS-CoV in the water, while SARS-CoV would bind to human ACE2 better than 2019-nCoV in the gas. Further investigation is needed to confirm such binding differences.",

This protein is critical for the vitality of coronaviruses because it is not only an important component for the virus particle but also plays a crucial role in attaching host cells and fusing the membranes [21] . In addition, the spike protein also determines the solubility of coronavirus particles and thus the viral infectivity because the spike protein is the largest protein located on the membrane surface. Therefore, the spike protein is directly related to the stability and functionality of coronaviuses. Here, we have run a lengthy MD simulation to study the trimeric spike proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Table 2 gives a comparison between the free energies of the spike proteins for 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. It can be seen from the table that the spike protein of 2019-nCoV has a significantly lower total free energy (G total = \u221267303.28 kcal/mol) than the spike protein of SARS-CoV (G total = \u221263139.96 kcal/mol) ( Table 2 ). These results suggest that 2019-nCoV is more stable and can survive a significantly higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also partly explain the higher infectivity of 2019-nCoV than SARS-CoV because 2019-nCoV would have a higher virus vitality than SARS-CoV in the same temperature.",

In other words, 2019-nCoV and other SARS-like coronavirus would have evolved to achieve a lower free energy for their spike proteins by recombination or mutations so that they can survive in high-temperature animals like bats [1] . In addition, the free energy decomposition also shows that the lower free energy of 2019-nCoV spike protein than SARS- Table 2 ). This may reflect an evolution trend for SARS-like coronaviruses, i.e. favoring the internal interactions between residues instead of the solvation energy.

As we know, the binding free energy between two proteins can be expressed as, \u2206G = \u2206E \u2212 T \u2206S, where \u2206E is the interaction energy, \u2206S is the entropy, and T is the temperature of the system.

In other words, 2019-nCoV is much more temperaturesensitive than SARS-CoV. Namely, 2019-nCoV will decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV when the temperature rises. Therefore, it is expected that 2019-nCoV will become less infectious compared to SARS-CoV, and the disease prevention and control for 2019-nCoV will get easier when the weather gets warmer/hotter, although the drug and vaccine development targeting the RBD protein will be more challenging because of the protein flexibility at the binding site.",

It was found that 2019-nCoV has a higher binding affinity with human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, explaining the fact that 2019-CoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. The spike protein of 2019-nCoV also shows a lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and may be able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also explain the bat origin of 2019-nCoV, as bats have a higher body-temperature than humans. In addition, the RBD of 2019-nCoV exhibits a significantly higher flexibility than that of SARS-CoV, especially near the binding site. That indicates that 2019-nCoV must overcome a higher entropy penalty in order to bind ACE2 and is thus more temperature-sensitive than SARS-CoV. Therefore, with the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease the infection ability much faster and become much less infectious than SARS-CoV, which would make the disease prevention and control of 2019-nCoV easier. Taking the above results together, unlike SARS-CoV that is gone after 2003, 2019-nCoV might survive the high-temperature environment like Summer in which the virus is not active/infectious due to the high flexibility in the RBD, and then become infectious when the temperature is low in the Winter. These findings will have a far-reaching implication for disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development for 2019-nCoV. ",
