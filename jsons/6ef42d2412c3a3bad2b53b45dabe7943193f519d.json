RNA extraction and reverse transcription were carried out as previously described 4 . DNA amplification and sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore platform were carried out according to the Artic protocol 5,6 (Supplementary Text), yielding between 31 and 582Mb of raw sequencing data per sample (Supplementary Table S1 ). Bioinformatic analysis was based on the Artic pipelines and additional manual curation was carried out (Supplementary Text), yielding completely resolved genomes with 2 -13 variant positions (Supplementary Table S2 ) relative to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome 7 . Of note, we observed evidence for multi-allelic variant positions in 11 of 55 samples (Supplementary Table S2) ; for one such sample (NRW-39; 13 positions called as multiallelic), PCR was repeated and a separate sequencing run was carried out, confirming the detected multi-allelic variant positions (Supplementary Text). Further work is necessary to investigate whether multi-allelic variant calls represent true within-patient strain variation. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we also successfully sequenced reverse-transcribed viral cDNA from patient material without an intermediate PCR-based amplification step (Supplementary Text), potentially enabling simplified sample preparation and increased read lengths for some samples in the future. Our study was IRB-approved by the ethics committee of the Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf (#2020-839).",

An analysis (Supplementary Text) of other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences did not reveal an obvious origin of the Heinsberg outbreak (Supplementary Table S4 ); the Heinsberg isolates are not related to early sequences from other German outbreak areas (Bavaria, Baden Wuerttemberg), and, despite intense Dutch viral sampling efforts (585 available viral genomes from the Netherlands at the time of analysis), our analysis identified only 2 closely related isolates from the Netherlands (one collected on 21 st March, the other with undefined collection date). The role of the first two patients' short vacation in the Netherlands seven days prior to the Gangelt carnival session 10 thus remains, while suggestive in terms of reported SARS-CoV-2 incubation periods 11 , ambiguous. What is more, large numbers of closely related isolates are circulating in many countries, for example England, Wales, and Iceland (Supplementary Table S4 ). The small number of stem variants (2) compared to the maximum number of per-isolate variants (6) in the Heinsberg isolates, likely acquired over a period of a few weeks, is compatible with a relatively recent introduction from China.

Improved methods to characterize the dynamics of viral transmission are urgently required. Here we have investigated the genetic structure of two related SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in Western Germany using Nanopore sequencing, which has additional applications in many fields such as human genetics 15 and microbial metagenomics 16 . We have demonstrated the clonal origin of the Heinsberg outbreak, consistent with existing epidemiological data on a carnival session in Gangelt as the epicentre of the outbreak. The lack of association between the Heinsberg samples and other early German outbreak isolates is suggestive of a separate introduction event, possibly via the Netherlands, China, or a third country. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in D\u00fcsseldorf are highly polyclonal and can be grouped into at least 5 clusters of viral haplotypes. Despite the geographical proximity between Heinsberg and D\u00fcsseldorf, only 4 of 36 unambiguously resolved samples from the D\u00fcsseldorf area clustered with the Heinsberg outbreak, and 2 of these were derived from residents of a district neighbouring Heinsberg. Limited detection of Heinsberg strains in the D\u00fcsseldorf area may reflect the efficacy of the contact tracing efforts conducted by the German public health authorities; of note, \"lockdown\"-type restrictions with limits on public gatherings in Germany were only imposed on 23 rd March 2020 17 , i.e. on the day on which the last sample of our study was collected. More extensive sampling of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Western Germany will be required to investigate the effect of various containment measures on transmission chains at a genomic level. Consistent with reports from Iceland 18 , New York 19 , and data on Nextstrain, our study has demonstrated the simultaneous circulation of distinct viral haplotypes in a metropolitan region; even within the Heinsberg outbreak, we could identify 5 distinct viral haplotypes. Importantly, as SARS-CoV-2 genomes continue to diverge as part of ongoing viral evolution, the application of genomic epidemiology 20,21 for the identification and targeted interruption of viral transmission chains will become increasingly feasible.",
