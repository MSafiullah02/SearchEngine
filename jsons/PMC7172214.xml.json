In vivo assays require the progeny RNA to be able to replicate and survive in the cell independently of the actual recombination event. In vivo, the recombination event cannot be separated into its individual biochemical steps: (1) generation of the nascent (primer) strand on the donor template, (2) transfer of the primer strand and replicase to the acceptor template, and (3) elongation on the acceptor template[10]. Moreover, if there is sequence identity across the recombination junction, the precise site of recombination cannot be determined by sequencing.",

This system examines recombination between 194-nt satellite RNA D (sat-RNA D) and 356-nt satellite RNA C of TCV (Fig. 1). Sat-RNA C is a chimera of sat-RNA D and a TCV defective interfering (DI) RNA. DI RNAs are efficient replicons comprising small portions of a viral genome from which most of the coding regions have been deleted by recombination. Sat-RNAs have no homology to their helper viruses. Their origins are unknown. Both sat- and DI RNAs contain cis-acting signals for replication by the replicase of the helper virus. These RNAs have advantages for recombination studies: there is less ambiguity regarding the effects of mutations because of the reduced gene coding and regulatory functions. Many recombination studies exploit such trans-replicated defective RNAs (Refs 2, 9).",

They found that a bulged stem\u2013 loop structure in the acceptor template strand is required for recombination in vivo[11](Fig. 1). This is a form of similarity-assisted recombination[9]. The recent paper by Nagy et al.[10]focuses on recognition of the acceptor template by the replicase and extension of the nascent strand, which acts as a primer. The latter function is of particular interest because TCV (and BMV) replicases cannot normally extend a primer annealed to single-stranded RNA. In contrast, poliovirus replicase can copy a template consisting only of poly(A) using either oligo(U) or its genome-linked protein (VPg) as a primer[12]. However, the model for TCV recombination involves extension of the nascent strand in a way that is biochemically the same as primer-extended RNA synthesis (Fig. 1).",

The primer and acceptor strands were connected by a large loop (Fig. 1), resulting in a partially duplex structure comprising this artificial stem\u2013loop, and the upstream bulged stem\u2013loop, which had been previously identified as being important for recombination[11]. The replicase could then extend the primer strand, copying the bulged stem\u2013loop and the single-stranded 5\u2032 end of the molecule. The small products were then rapidly quantified and sized. However, sizes of products were difficult to interpret because of the high degree of secondary structure, which resisted denaturation.",

Importantly, there was a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo effects. Generally, mutations that reduced efficiency of primer extension to <24% of that on the `wild-type' molecule eliminated recombination in vivo. Both stems in the bulged stem\u2013loop upstream (in the template sense) of the acceptor strand were necessary for efficient primer extension, although their sequence was not as important. Deletion of bases in the bulge greatly reduced primer extension and eliminated recombination. Some specific bases in the terminal loop were also necessary.",

The length, sequence and 3\u2032 position of the primer were not important in determining whether extension could take place. Less stable priming stems gave less efficient extension. Thus, primer binding to the acceptor serves only as an extendible nascent RNA strand and is not involved in specific recognition of the acceptor by the replicase. In support of the role of the bulged stem\u2013loop in specific recognition by the replicase, RNA molecules containing only this region, without the primer stem, were found to inhibit primer extension in trans. Nonfunctional mutant bulged stem\u2013loops did not inhibit primer extension significantly. Thus, two structures are necessary to attract the nascent RNA and the replicase to the acceptor strand. The region of complementarity attracts the nascent RNA strand, and the bulged stem\u2013loop may be the `handle' by which the replicase grabs the acceptor strand.",

Although Simon's work is a promising early step in the dissection of recombination mechanisms, many questions remain. For example, what features on the donor template encourage dissociation of the replicase and nascent strand? Possibilities proposed for a variety of RNAs include a stable secondary structure, the 5\u2032 end of the template itself or AU-rich regions that weaken the interaction between the nascent strand and the template. In coronaviruses, dissociation has been attributed to the nonprocessive nature of the replicase[2]. In BMV, the replication complex is initially highly abortive but then undergoes a modification allowing efficient elongation[13]. Perhaps, at some points of the RNA synthesis, the replication complex can revert to its loosely bound abortive state and subsequently dissociate.",
