            "text": "Conjunctivitis in rabbits is common. In normal rabbits with no ocular or respiratory disease, the most frequently isolated organisms from the conjunctival cul de sac include Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, and Bacillus species. Less common organisms include Bordetella, Stomatococcus, Neisseria, Pasteurella, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, and Moraxella species.14 However, Pasteurella multocida is a cause of conjunctivitis, epiphora, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, and dacryocystitis in rabbits.27., 38. A wide variety of other infectious agents also have been associated with conjunctivitis in rabbits, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas species, Haemophilus species, Treponema paraluiscuniculi, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, and myxoma virus.27., 45., 60. In New Zealand white rabbits with conjunctivitis, upper respiratory disease, and pneumonia, bacterial isolates consisted of Bordetella broncheptica, P. multocida, S. aureus, and Pseudomonas alcaligenes.50 Mucopurulent conjunctivitis and blepharitis with corneal ulceration have been associated with S. aureus infection in a rabbit.45 Treatment with topical gentamicin ophthalmic ointment and systemic gentamicin was curative. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was isolated in a rabbit with severe bilateral conjunctivitis. (K. Quesenberry, personal communication). Other causes of conjunctivitis in rabbits include foreign bodies, entropion, distichia, trichiasis, and high ammonia or dust content in the environment. Dental disease, including root elongation and dental abscesses, is also associated with conjunctivitis.",

The discharge often has a white, gritty appearance and may be intermittent and resistant to treatment with topical antibiotics. Root elongation of the maxillary incisors is a common underlying cause.27 The elongated roots can cause an obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct at its flexure just caudal to the roots of the incisors. Radiographs of the skull are needed to assess the incisors; excess curvature of the incisor roots is abnormal. In one report describing two affected rabbits and 13 normal rabbits, radiographs revealed a cystic dilation of the nasolacrimal duct immediately caudal to the duct flexure, and the incisors were more arched than in normal rabbits.38 Irrigation of the nasolacrimal duct in affected rabbits yielded opaque, white, gritty fluid which, on cytologic examination, showed numerous macrophages, lipid-laden mesothelial cells, lipid droplets, and small numbers of bacteria and erythrocytes. Occlusion of the ducts was presumed to be attributed to fat droplets. Bacteriologic culture of fluids used to irrigate the nasolacrimal ducts of both normal and affected rabbits yielded similar bacterial isolates; therefore microorganisms may not be important in the pathogenesis of epiphora in rabbits. The most common bacterial isolates were S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, Moraxella and Neisseria species, Oligella urethralis, and Streptococcus viridans. In a study of 28 cases of dacryocystitis in rabbits, 89% of cases were unilateral. The cause was determined to be dental malocclusion in 50%, no apparent cause in 35%, rhinitis in 7%, both rhinitis and dental malocclusion in 4%, and panophthalmitis in 4%. Most animals (98%) were treated with topical antibiotics, with a mean duration of 5.8 weeks.21\n",

After instilling a topical ophthalmic anesthetic, use a 23-gauge lacrimal cannula or a 22- to 24-gauge Teflon intravenous catheter to flush the duct (Fig. 37-2\n). Recurrence of the obstruction is common, and duct irrigation may need to be repeated every 2 to 3 days or weekly until a few consecutive clear irrigations are obtained. If topical antibiotic therapy is used, a broad-spectrum medication such as triple antibiotic solution is recommended. Topical nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory ophthalmic medications, such as 0.03% flurbiprofen or 0.1% diclofenac, may help minimize irritation caused by the procedure. In rabbits with chronic or severe infections, concurrent topical ophthalmic and systemic antibiotic therapy may be needed. Suggested combinations include systemic enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer Corporation, Shawnee Mission, KS) or marbofloxacin (Zeniquin, Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA) and topical ciprofloxacin or gentamicin ophthalmic solution. In rabbits with evidence of underlying incisor root elongation, removing the incisors can be considered in severe cases.",

In Watanabe rabbits, yellowish-white granules can develop along the corneal-scleral junction and in the iris.

Membranous corneal occlusion, or pseudopterygium, is a pain-free condition that may affect one or both eyes (Fig. 37-3\n). Ophthalmic examination reveals a circular membrane that originates at the limbus (the junction of the cornea and sclera) and gradually advances over the cornea. In severe cases, only a small central opening is present, allowing visibility of an otherwise normal globe. The membrane does not adhere to the cornea. The cause of this condition is unknown, although trauma has been suggested. Progressive membranous occlusion in rabbits has been compared with pterygium in humans. However, in humans the membrane is triangular and adherent to the cornea, whereas in rabbits it is nonadherent and circumferential from the limbus. Treatment with topical antibiotic or antibiotic-steroid medications has no effect. The membrane can be resected surgically and treated with topical antibiotics postoperatively; this usually results in quick recurrence of the membrane. However, if the membrane is resected a few millimeters beyond the limbus and the eye is then treated with a topical antibiotic-steroid combination, recurrence may be prevented. Good results have also been obtained with surgical resection and the use of topical cyclosporine with or without corticosteroids.57 Another described surgical technique is to incise the membrane into four to six quadrants and suture each quadrant of the membrane to the inside of the eyelid.3., 59. With this technique, recurrence may be prevented for at least 1 year.",

Many rabbits infected withE. cuniculi are asymptomatic, but neurologic signs can include convulsions, tremors, torticollis, paresis, and coma. Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection has also been associated with phacoclastic uveitis.20., 23., 63. Most affected rabbits are young (less than 2 years of age), and dwarf rabbits appear predisposed to this disease. Clinically, a white mass is often seen protruding into the anterior chamber (Fig. 37-4\n). Careful examination of the anterior segment of the eye with slit-lamp biomicroscopy may reveal a break in the anterior lens capsule. The break is frequently hidden by inflammatory material and it may appear as if only the iris is involved in the inflammatory process. A focal cataract is often present in the area of the anterior lens capsule break. Signs of a severe pyogranulomatous anterior uveitis are usually present, such as conjunctival hyperemia, a swollen hyperemic iris, miosis, aqueous flare, and low intraocular pressure. The posterior segment of the eye is initially normal; however, if left untreated, severe uveitis and cataract formation can lead to blindness and possible phthisis bulbi or glaucoma. An abscess in the iris caused by P. multocida initially may resemble phacoclastic uveitis. Measurement of serum antibody titers for E. cuniculi and P. multocida may aid in the differential diagnosis. The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the lens by phacofragmentation. Because of the rabbit\u2019s ability to regenerate a lens after this procedure, insertion of an artificial lens after phacofragmentation is not recommended. Systemic treatment of E. cuniculi with albendazole (30 mg/kg PO q24h for 30 days, then 15 mg/kg PO q24h for an additional 30 days) has been reported.63 Fenbendazole (20 mg/kg q24h for 28 days) has proved effective in both preventing experimental E. cuniculi infection in rabbits and treating naturally infected seropositive rabbits.64 If the lens is not removed surgically, control of the uveitis with topical steroidal (such as 1% prednisolone acetate) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as well as systemic fenbendazole or albendazole is necessary. Enucleation may be indicated if the uveitis cannot be controlled medically and a chronically painful eye is present.23., 74.\n",

If the abscess is caused by an abscessed tooth root, the tooth or teeth must be extracted to allow drainage and the rabbit treated with long-term systemic antibiotic therapy. In some cases aggressive surgical debridement may be necessary. This may include exenteration of the orbit and sacrifice of a sighted eye. Even with aggressive surgical and medical management, the prognosis for recovery is always guarded. Stomatoscopy-aided dental trimming, tooth removal, and debridement successfully treated a retrobulbar abscess in a rabbit.39 Anecdotal reports suggest that some rabbits with retrobulbar abscesses respond to medical therapy with long-term (3-month) administration of benzathine/procaine penicillin G (for rabbits < 2.5 kg, 75,000 U per rabbit SC q48h; for rabbits > 2.5 kg, 150,000 U per rabbit SC q48h).56\n",

Periodic exophthalmos is common in rabbits with thymomas (see Chapter 20).34., 53., 68. In one report, a localized myasthenia gravis associated with the thymoma was suggested as a cause.68 More probably, the presence of a large intrathoracic mass causes cranial vena cava syndrome, in which the mass compresses vessels in the cranial thorax.53 This compression impedes blood flow in the right and left cranial vena cava as well as the external jugular veins and causes decreased vascular drainage from the head. Exophthalmos was also reported in a rabbit after the chronic placement of an external jugular catheter,29 and bilateral exophthalmos can develop with thrombosis of both jugular veins. The external jugular veins are the largest vessels draining the head, whereas the internal jugular veins of rabbits are relatively small and primarily drain the brain, throat, and neck regions. Therefore occlusion of the external jugular veins will compromise vascular drainage of the head. In clinical cases, exophthalmos secondary to venous thrombosis often resolves spontaneously, presumably after the jugular veins become patent again.

Severity ranged from clinically insignificant, small cataracts in the posterior cortex of the lens to blinding, complete cataracts. By 18 months of age, cataracts were detected in virtually every animal, and in animals previously diagnosed, the cataracts had progressed. A genetically separate group had a combination of blinding cataract, microphthalmos, abnormal iris formation, and retinal detachment. In another ferret colony, microphthalmos, cataract, retinal dysplasia, and a persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous-type membrane were shown to be inherited as an autosomal dominant defect.17 Dietary factors may play a role in the development of cataracts in ferrets. A diet high in fat or deficient in vitamin E or protein may promote cataract formation.43 In ferrets with cataracts, monitor the eyes regularly for the onset of secondary complications. Lens-induced uveitis can usually be controlled with topical 1% prednisolone acetate applied once or twice daily. Other complications caused by cataracts are lens subluxation or luxation and glaucoma. Ferrets that are blind because of cataracts usually adjust well in a home environment. However, cataract surgery can be performed successfully in ferrets. The lenses can be removed by phacofragmentation or by an extracapsular technique. Artificial lenses are not available in a size suitable for ferrets.

Cytologic examination of a sample from the retrobulbar area obtained by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration can confirm the diagnosis of neoplasia. However, this procedure can be difficult because of the limited size of the retrobulbar space. Instead, in cases of suspected orbital lymphosarcoma, diagnosis may be confirmed by obtaining samples for diagnostic tests elsewhere in the body, such as a fine-needle aspirate or wedge biopsy of an enlarged lymph node. In ferrets with lymphosarcoma, therapy is directed at treating the disease systemically with prednisone or chemotherapeutic agents. While treating the ferret for lymphosarcoma, temporary tarsorrhaphy may be necessary to protect the cornea if pronounced exophthalmos is present. If the corneal epithelium is intact, protect the eye of a ferret with exophthalmos with lubricating ophthalmic ointment applied two to four times daily. If an ulcer is present, treat with an antibiotic ophthalmic ointment, such as triple antibiotic or gentamicin ointment, applied three to four times daily. In cases of retrobulbar adenocarcinoma, treatment may include exenteration and radiation therapy.40 Zygomatic salivary gland mucocele is another reported cause of exophthalmos in ferrets.44 Fine-needle aspiration of a soft fluctuant swelling dorsotemporal to the eye yields a tenacious, blood-tinged fluid. Surgical excision is usually curative (see Chapters 3 and 11Chapter 3Chapter 11).",

Diseases involving all parts of the eye have been described. Common abnormalities include retinal degeneration, as in the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat strain66; microphthalmos; and cataracts. In addition to specific genetically determined ocular abnormalities in inbred strains, other spontaneous abnormalities occur. Ophthalmic examination of 6,000 Sprague-Dawley rats revealed a focal linear retinopathy in 3% and a fundic coloboma in 0.5%.30 Spontaneous corneal degeneration has been described in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats,7 and corneal dystrophy has been described in Fischer 344 rats.36 Experimental infections also lead to ophthalmic abnormalities. Blepharitis with crust formation in the medial canthus and partial periocular alopecia were observed in mice experimentally infected with Trypanosoma brucei.61\n",

Sialodacryoadenitis virus is a highly contagious coronavirus that replicates in the respiratory tract epithelium, causing rhinotracheitis, bronchitis, and alveolitis. The virus also causes sialoadenitis of the submandibular and parotid salivary glands and necrotizing dacryoadenitis of orbital and harderian lacrimal glands. Exophthalmos, epiphora, and keratoconjunctivitis may result. The infection usually resolves within 1 week in immunocompetent animals. In a study of athymic rats, infection persisted for more than 3 months, indicating that normal T-cell function is required for host defenses against the virus.72 Infection with sialodacryoadenitis virus may also result in uveitis and multifocal retinal degeneration.33 Complications from infection include corneal opacification, anterior and posterior synechiae, cataract, and glaucoma. Specific therapy is not available, and treatment is supportive only. Other causes for red tears include infection with parainfluenza virus type 3 or Sendai virus as well as pain or stress. Ammonia vapor from soiled bedding can act as an ocular irritant, predisposing animals to secondary infection. Keeping the housing areas well ventilated is important in preventing infection with sialodacryoadenitis virus.",
