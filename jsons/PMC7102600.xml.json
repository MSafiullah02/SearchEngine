The immense potential of this strategy, which in principle only requires knowledge of the target mRNA sequence, was quickly realized within both academic and industrial laboratories. Interestingly, \u201cMother Nature\u201d has also exploited this potential, as convincingly demonstrated in bacteria [3] and later on in eukaryotes [4] by their ability to capitalize on such potent biochemical and genetic tools. The best demonstration that the antisense concept is exploited came from the discovery that antisense genes are able to control transcription in bacteria (and with less experimental evidence in eukaryotic cells) and finely tune the expression of target genes. However, these natural antisense RNAs turned out to be long and highly structured, and attempts to use this knowledge in the design of synthetic antisense genes proved disappointing. Most studies so far in the antisense field have instead focussed on short single-stranded DNA mimics, the hybridization of which allows recruitment of the cellular enzyme RNase H and as a consequence leads to the destruction of the RNA target [5].",

It became rapidly realized that a major outcome is the possibility of exon re-assortment and that this is the case for the majority of human genes. Importantly in terms of potential clinical translation, several human diseases are associated with dysfunction of the splicing machinery (as in \u03b2-thalassemia) or with the preferential use of one splicing event rather than another. Intervention with the process of exon selection using low molecular weight drugs has turned out to be difficult and the most promising strategy was proposed instead by Ryszard Kole and colleagues as detailed in Section 2 of this issue. In contrast to the \u201cclassical\u201d antisense ON strategy, splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) are designed to prevent (or promote) the insertion of exons through high affinity binding at obligatory splicing sequences in the nuclear pre-mRNA (for example donor or acceptor splice sites) and therefore RNase H-incompetent ON analogues must be used [6].",

The current detailed knowledge of RNAi processing and recognition by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) has led to the possibility of rational design and synthesis of artificial siRNAs able to recognize any mRNA on the sole basis of their sequences. As for RNase H-competent antisense ON, sequence-specific recognition of the RNA target leads to its degradation by the RISC-associated nuclease. Further, several hundred human genes have now been identified to code for short stem-loop structures, known as micro RNAs (miRNAs), which are processed to allow targeting of the 3\u2032-UTRs of mRNAs and many such mRNA targets have been identified [8], [9], [10]. Astonishingly, miRNAs do not need to hybridize over their entire sequence to promote the down-regulation of an mRNA target [11]. As a consequence, a single miRNA is able to regulate the expression of a complex set of mRNAs, which are often related in terms of cellular function. Although still incomplete, ongoing studies show that specific sets of miRNAs control most cellular functions and that dysregulation of their expression is associated with many human diseases. Regulation of the levels of certain miRNAs or interference with their binding to mRNA targets are both now heavily explored strategies.",

However, their systemic in vivo administration has been plagued by toxicity and by low efficiency in the presence of serum proteins. Therapeutic developments centred on the use of naked ONs have thus met with only limited successes. Indeed, more than two decades of therapeutic developments have only led to three FDA approved drugs, with two used for easier-to-manage topical ocular applications (Fomivirsen as an antisense treatment for ocular cytomegalovirus infections in immunocompromised patients [12] and Ranibizumab, an aptamer for the treatment of macular degeneration [13]). Of more promise is the recent approval in the US (but not yet in Europe) of Mipomersen [14], an antisense ON for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, which capitalizes on the accumulation of phosphorothioate (PS) ONs in the liver after systemic administration. Encouraging small scale clinical data have also been reported in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with 2\u2032-O-methyl phosphorothioate (2\u2032-OMePS) ONs (Drisapersen [15], [16], [17]) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotides (PMO, Eteplirsen [18], [19], [20]), as will be extensively discussed later in Section 4 of this chapter.",

For example, it was found that the full size purified HIV-1 Tat protein trans-activates the HIV-1 LTR promoter when incubated with cells [25]. More astonishingly, this same Tat protein was able as a conjugate to promote the cellular internalization of the non-permeable protein \u03b2-galactosidase and this paved the way for the use of Tat as a delivery vector for biomolecules. Along the same lines, the purified Antennapedia protein from drosophila was able to exert its transcriptional activity when incubated with nerve cells and this property was ascribed to a short peptide named Penetratin [26]. Dissection of the Tat protein did also show that cell penetration was due to a small, basic amino acids-rich peptide known as the Tat peptide [27]. Initial studies of the cellular trafficking of both Penetratin and Tat suggested an unusual non-receptor dependent mechanism of direct translocation across the plasma membrane. Although challenged later on as detailed in Section 7, this mechanism and the possibility to use such so called cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) as non-viral delivery vectors for biomolecules, fostered a very large interest. Many CPPs were rapidly discovered and proposed as vectors for the transport of various drugs across biological membranes, starting from low molecular mass drugs to very large molecular entities such as nanoparticles.",

This mutated intron has been introduced into the coding region of a reporter luciferase gene and the construction has been stably transfected in HeLa cells, which are available from ATCC (ATCC\u00ae CCL-2\u2122).

Further, a Penetratin peptide was synthesized continuously at the C-terminus of a triplex-forming PNA to target chromosomal DNA for genetic modification of haematopoietic progenitor cells in mice [35]. Promising microRNA knockdown results were obtained also when an antisense Lys\u2013PNA\u2013(Lys)3 derivative was tested in mouse spleen for targeting microRNA-155 [36]. Very recently an anti-microRNA 155 PNA disulphide-conjugated (Fig. 3A) to a tumour-targeting pHLIP peptide has been shown to have potent activity in a mouse model of lymphoma [71]. The only other example of a peptide\u2013PNA active in vivo that was not synthesized by continuous solid-phase assembly was an Arg-rich CPP Pip2a (and related Pip2b) conjugated through a thioether bridge by reaction of a C-terminal Cys residue on the peptide to an N-terminal bromoacetyl group on the PNA (Fig. 3B) [30]. The conjugates were active by intramuscular injection into the mdx mouse, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), but later higher activity was found in vivo when using PMO rather than PNA as the ON material [33].",

Later the 5\u2032-piperazine was directly conjugated through an amide linkage using C-terminally activated peptides (Fig. 4B) [61]. 5\u2032-conjugation can also be carried out with commercially available amino-link functionalised PMO by direct coupling to the C-terminal carboxylic acid of the peptide through an amide link [30], [33]. More generally now, the secondary amine of the 3\u2032-morpholino group is coupled directly to the C-terminal carboxylic acid of the PMO via an amide link (Fig. 4C) [73], [74].

This severe, X-linked recessive disease results from mutations in the DMD gene [79]. The disorder is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and wasting, along with the emergence of respiratory and cardiac complications, ultimately leading to premature death [80]. The majority of mutations underlying DMD are genomic deletions, encompassing multiple exons thereby producing a premature truncation of the open reading frame and resulting in the absence of the dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is an integral component of the dystrophin associated protein complex (DAPC), forming a crucial connection between the intracellular actin-cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Exon skipping therapy utilises SSOs to target specific regions of the DMD transcript, inducing the exclusion of individual exons, leading to the restoration of aberrant reading frames and resulting in the production of an internally deleted, yet largely functional, dystrophin protein [8].",

The beneficial tissue targeting attributes of phage peptides may be further enhanced when combined with the delivery efficiency of CPPs, to develop a chimeric peptide. This was demonstrated when MSP was coupled to the B-peptide to determine the combined efficacy in mdx mice [32], [95].

Additional in vivo screening of Pip\u2013PMO compounds was carried out to identify optimal CPPs for dystrophin splicing and correction in mdx mice. In the Pip5-series (Pip5e-o), the core sequence, ILFQY, was retained and there was alteration in the composition and length of the flanking regions [33]. The number of arginine residues ranged between 8 and 10, and the number and placement of 6-aminohexanoic acid (X) and \u00df-alanine (B) spacer residues also varied in the flanking regions (Table 2). Pip5e\u2013, Pip5j\u2013, Pip5l\u2013, and Pip5n\u2013PMO resulted in the greatest number of dystrophin positive fibres following intramuscular administration (tibialis anterior muscle). Of these highly efficient CPPs, Pip5e\u2013PMO induced the highest levels of exon skipping and dystrophin restoration body wide including in the heart, following a single 25 mg/kg intravenous administration. When directly compared to B-PMO, Pip5e\u2013PMO was shown to restore considerably greater dystrophin protein levels in the heart (intravenous administration comparison).",

As cardiac and respiratory complications are the leading causes of death amongst DMD patients, the ability of Pip6\u2013PMO to restore cardiac function is vital. These compounds demonstrated their restorative ability in a long term, low dose administration study (10 mg/kg over 3 month time-course) in which 30% dystrophin protein was restored in heart and the onset of cardiomyopathy was prevented in an exercised mdx mouse model (unpublished data). Liver and kidney toxicity has been assessed 2 weeks after the administration of Pip\u2013PMO conjugates in mdx mice with no sign of toxicity [33], [99].

Antisense ONs have been used to modulate RNA processing in the triplet repeat disorder myotonic dystrophy [OMIM: 160900, 602668]. This degenerative disease arises from the expansion of pathogenic microsatellite repeats within noncoding regions of either the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) or CCHC-type zinc finger, nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP) gene loci [99], [100]. A variety of antisense ON strategies have been used to combat the effect of these toxic RNA expansions, although currently the most promising is the use of steric block ONs [101]. Using this approach, ONs were designed to bind to the DMPK repeat regions, therefore preventing the detrimental sequestering of RNA-binding proteins to within the expansion. Due to the multisystemic nature of myotonic dystrophy, a CPP conjugated antisense ON strategy has recently been tested in a mouse model to induce body wide distribution [102].",

This autosomal recessive disease is caused by mutations in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. The related SMN2 gene undergoes alternative splicing due to a single nucleotide polymorphism, and therefore lacks exon 7 in the majority of transcripts, resulting in low protein expression. In order to functionally compensate for the loss of SMN1 protein in patients, SSOs have been used to promote the inclusion of exon 7 in SMN2 transcripts, and therefore increase the production of SMN2 protein [8]. Substantial headway has been made with naked SSOs in animal models of SMA [103] and clinical trials are ongoing. However, the effective delivery of antisense ONs to motor neurons in the CNS constitutes a major challenge, which may be combatted by CPP conjugation.",

With regard to the mechanism of internalization, there is no consensus point of view for the cell entry of non-covalent complexes (see Section 7). However, as these complexes rely on electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between positively charged CPPs and negatively charged ONs, their cellular uptake mechanism could be also controlled by structural polymorphism of peptides, particle stability and the nature of complexes/membrane interactions [122]. Interestingly, some CPP:ON non-covalent complexes were shown to enter cells through a direct translocation process [123]. Most non-covalent CPPs enable a wide range of chemical modifications and combinations and the modular nature of both peptides and resulting CPP:ONs particles also allows new developments.",

            "text": "The first developments of MPG were based on peptide/ON interactions and investigations of CPP:ON affinity by fluorescence spectrometry to measure the dissociation constant (Kd) as well as the optimal molar ratio and/or charge ratio to obtain stable complexes [86], [124]. A molar ratio (MR) of 7 peptides per ON and a charged-corrected (N/P) ratio of 2 positively charged amino acids (N) for a phosphate group (P) were estimated [125]. Similar approaches were used for other non-covalent CPPs such as Pep-3 for HypNA\u2013pPNA [49], CADY, C6 and MPEG-PCL-CH2R4H2C for siRNA condensation [126], [127], [128], [129]. Fluorescence assays were also combined to circular dichroism (CD) analyses to monitor conformational changes that might occur in the presence of the ON and during CPP:ON complex formation [125], [128], [129], [130]. Although both fluorescence and CD investigations suggest interactions and formation of CPP:ON complexes, the use of gel shift assays has been generalized to demonstrate the formation of complexes [124], [131]. However, none gives a clear characterization of CPP:ON particles in terms of colloidal properties (size, charge and shape). Studies on colloidal properties of CPP:ON complexes have therefore been witnessed over recent years. Methods used for other nanomedicines were applied in order to characterize the size, surface charge and morphology of these CPP:ON complexes. In 2008, Law et al. were the first to report the hydrodynamic diameter and the Zeta potential of R9:siRNA non-covalent complexes [132]. After UV\u2013visible absorbance and CD investigations suggesting R9/siRNA interactions, size and Zeta potential were measured for several charge ratios (+/\u2212) and revealed that R9 forms particles with siRNA, with a hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 1 \u03bcm at siRNA saturation [132]. Zeta potential increased with the hydrodynamic diameter of particles, supporting the positive contribution of the guanidinium group of R9 in the surface charge. Size and Zeta potential have to be estimated in parallel since, according to DVLO theory for colloidal systems, low Zeta potential suggest low electrostatic repulsion which induce aggregation of particles whereas high absolute value of Zeta potential are indicative of stable particles suspension [133].",

However, these parameters might be very different according to the CPP, the nature of the ON or the formulation protocol [131]. For example, Kim et al. identified small R15:siRNA nanoparticles with a 224 nm diameter and a + 7 mV Zeta potential for a charge-corrected N/P ratio of 3 in PBS [53] whilst CADY:siRNA nanoparticles have a size of 156 nm and surface charge of + 50 mV whatever the MR (MR20 to MR80) in 5 mM NaCl [134]. CADY:siRNA nanoparticles have a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.37, suggesting homogeneous and unimodal nanoparticles [134]. For other CPP:ON complexes, the size and the biological activity clearly vary with the MR [50]. Size and charge can also depend on the environment which is important since nanoparticles stability and homogeneity might vary according to the nature of the buffer, as described for C6M1:siRNA particles [130]. In addition physiological conditions such as serum addition can influence colloidal properties. PepFect6:siRNA complexes form homogenous unimodal nanoparticles of 70\u2013100 nm (PDI ~ 0.1\u20130.2), which remained stable in water, whilst the presence of serum proteins induces larger particles of 125\u2013200 nm with a wider distribution [51]. CPP:ON complexes can also be stabilized by specific excipients, such as lactose [88], 5% mannitol [135] or albumin [52].",

With regard to siRNA, the first reports on PBN-mediated delivery of siRNA in vivo involved MPG-\u0394NLS peptide and a cholesterol oligo-d-arginine (Chol-R9) [54], [138]. MPG-\u0394NLS was used for the in vivo delivery of siRNA targeting Oct-4 into mouse blastocytes. Oct-3/4 (POU5f1) is one of the earliest transcription factors expressed in the embryo and both the pluripotency and the fate of ES cells depend upon a tight control of Oct-3/4 expression. MPG-\u0394NLS-based nanoparticles induced a siRNA-mediated inhibition of up regulation of Oct-3/4 in ES cells which prevents their specification toward the mesoderm and their differentiation into cardiomyocytes [138]. Similarly, injection of PBN in the inner cell mass of blastocysts impairs cardiogenesis in early embryos [138]. Chol-R9 was applied for the delivery of siRNA targeting VEGF (siVGEF) in CT-26 cells xenografted tumour. Intratumoural administration of Chol-R9:siVGEF complexes induced a significant inhibition of tumour growth associated with a pronounced decrease in VEGF level in the tumour, suggesting a synergistic effect between the d-amino acids of the CPP and the cholesterol moiety [54].",

Systemic administration of PepFect6:siRNA nanoparticles (1 mg/kg) induced a significant down regulation (> 60%) of the HPRT1 mRNA level in liver, kidney, and lung, without induction of immune response [51]. In addition, PepFect6-based nanoparticles were also used for RNAi-mediated silencing of luciferase (Luc-siRNA) in mice expressing luciferase in the liver and intravenous injection of PepFect6:luc-siRNA (1 mg/kg) displayed decrease of bioluminescence for 2 weeks, reaching 75% gene silencing whilst naked Luc-siRNA was unable to induce a RNAi response [51]. Likewise, Chol-R9, R15:siRNA nanoparticles were formulated for siRNA-mediated knockdown of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) in human ovary adenocarcinoma cells (SK-OV-3). A reduction of HER-2 expression was associated with the inhibition of SK-OV-3 xenograft tumour growth [139].

However the non-covalent strategy is also intended to deliver other types of ONs, such AS-ONs or SSOs, in vivo. In this light, Pep-3 was formulated with the antisense cyclin B1 HypNA-pPNA and the resulting PBN were evaluated on PC3 xenografted mice [49]. PBN were administrated through intratumoural or intravenous injection every 3 days, and the biological effect of the antisense HyPNA-pPNA was evaluated by monitoring tumour growth during 2 weeks after injection. Intratumoural administration of PBN induced a 50% inhibition of tumour growth at a 1 mg ON dose and more than 92% at a 5 mg dose, whereas intravenous injection only reduced tumour growth by 20% at a 10 mg dose. Consequently in order to improve the in vivo stability of PBN, small amounts of PEGylated-Pep-3 were included in formulation [49]. Intravenous administration of 10 mg of ON with PBN containing 20% of PEGylated-Pep-3 significantly improved PBN stability and inhibited tumour growth by more than 90%, which was 4\u20135-fold more efficient than un-PEGylated-Pep-3 [49].

On the basis of physico-chemical investigations (e.g., circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared and electrophysiological measurements on model membranes), two very similar models have been proposed for MPG:siRNA and CADY:siRNA PBNs based on the formation of transient pore-like structures [125], [160]. A partial conformational change takes place upon MPG complexation with nucleic acids, and an increase in \u03b2-sheet content upon association with the cell membrane [125]. CADY:siRNA PBNs were characterized in more details (reviewed in [160]). CADY-mediated cellular uptake of siRNA is extremely rapid [126]. Moreover, internalization and biological activity of CADY:siRNA occurred even at 4 \u00b0C and under inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation revealing an energy-independent mechanism [123]. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that neither Transferrin, nor Rab5 co-localized with CADY:siRNA nanoparticles whereas co-localization with Lysotracker was observed to some extent [123]. These data further support an uptake mechanism largely independent of classical endocytosis with a degradation of the nanoparticles via the lysosomal pathway.",

Its uptake in cells can indeed be inhibited by a clathrin-specific siRNA or via cell transfection cells with a mutant form of dynamin [171]. However, dynamin is now known to regulate other endocytic and membrane trafficking pathways. Alternatively pharmacological inhibitors, such as chlorpromazine or dynasore (a dynamin inhibitor), can be used to inhibit this pathway even if these reagents cause significant cell toxicity and have to be used over short incubation times [18], [19], [20]. Potassium depletion or hypertonic medium incubation is also commonly used to investigate clathrin-mediated endocytosis [21], [22].",
