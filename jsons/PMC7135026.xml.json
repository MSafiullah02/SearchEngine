Balancing clinical management, contact tracing, and appropriately targeted case isolation requires collaboration among physicians, researchers, and local authorities official and unofficial, as well as the media and cultural sectors of the societies involved, perhaps to a greater degree than with any other emerging pathogen. Because beliefs about Ebola's mode of transmission affect behaviors that in turn can either stymie or amplify that transmission, there is no hard-and-fast line between clinical considerations and cultural contexts. As personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential for physical safety, scientific skepticism about circulating misinformation is essential in treatment and containment efforts.",

MSF spokesperson Sandra Murillo emphasizes the sharp contrast between the medical interventions that are possible in the directly affected nations and those in the United States, where lifesaving components of supportive care (rehydration, ventilation, electrolyte monitoring, and dialysis) are routinely available. Despite those obstacles, African and Western personnel working in the field since 1976 have generated extensive knowledge about protective measures. The cultural contexts complicating EVD management are less clearly understood, but improved communications in both directions between West African societies and the industrialized West, experienced observers contend, are essential for appropriate containment on both fronts.",

Someone actually has to be symptomatic and sick, and then you have to have direct contact with some of their secretions. So the good news is that early on, it's relatively hard to transmit and actually contract the disease. Later on, in the treatment phase, when a patient's really sick, it's very easy\u2026.
