A retrospective observational cohort study including critically ill patients with respiratory tract infections during a 2-year period was conducted. Intervention group included patients that received nebulized and systemic antimicrobials. Patients in the control group received only systemic antimicrobials. Clinical resolution was the primary endpoint. Secondary outcomes included change in fever, inflammatory parameters, and creatinine clearance; length of hospital stay, systemic therapy, and mechanical ventilation; hospital readmission; and mortality. Regression models were performed to estimate the effect of nebulized antibiotics on outcome variables adjusted by potential confounders. A total of 136 patients were included (93 in control group and 43 in intervention group). The intervention group had higher odds of clinical resolution (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 7.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.2, 43.3). Nebulized antibiotic therapy was independently associated with reduction in procalcitonin (adjusted OR: 12.4; 95% CI: 1.4, 109.7). There were no significant differences in the rest of the secondary outcomes or in creatinine clearance reduction. Adding nebulized antibiotics for the management of respiratory tract infections has a positive impact on clinical resolution without increasing the risk of renal toxicity.",

However, their role in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with respiratory tract infections is controversial. Currently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society guidelines for hospital-acquired and ventilatorassociated pneumonia recommend the addition of inhaled antibiotics in patients with VAP due to Gram-negative bacilli that are susceptible to only aminoglycosides or polymyxins (very low-quality evidence) and consider reasonable the adjunctive inhaled therapy as a last-resort treatment in patients who are not responding to intravenous therapy alone, whether the infecting organism is or is not multidrug-resistant [6] . In contrast, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases recommends avoiding the use of nebulized antibiotics for the treatment of respiratory infections in invasively mechanically ventilated adults due to a weak level of evidence of their efficacy and the high potential for underestimated risks of adverse events [7] .",

The presence of a new and progressive or persistent infiltrate on chest radiography was the major distinguishing feature between pneumonia and tracheobronchitis, which was not present in the latter. A diagnosis of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis registered by a physician in the patient chart was mandatory for considering the inclusion of the patients in the study.

However, this was not consistently translated into significant differences in duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, or all-cause mortality. As for safety results, nebulized therapy did not lead to an increased risk of nephrotoxicity [11] . With respect to antimicrobial resistance, the limited data available suggest that the use of nebulized antibiotics would not be associated with an increased resistance [1, 14] . In the review mentioned before, the risk of developing new resistant strains was significantly lower with adjunctive nebulized therapy in comparison with receiving only systemic antibiotics in patients with VAT [11] .

Nevertheless, each physician evaluated patients' clinical situation under his responsibility without knowing that this study was going to be conducted. In addition, the study also included various objective outcomes, such as reduction in CRP and PCT, and resolution of leukocytosis and fever, reducing the risk of bias. In future studies, objective and uniform scales such as the clinical pulmonary infection score have to be implemented. Furthermore, there is a need for standardizing practices and for developing guidelines regarding the use of nebulized antibiotics. Despite these limitations, our study represents the clinical practice and realworld scenarios scarcely collected in the scientific literature. Further studies are warranted to confirm the obtained results. ",
