Most of their genomes do not encode tRNAs, thus their translation of viral proteins relies on the hosts' tRNA pools (Kumar et al. 2016). A successful infection requires that viruses possess the ability to enter the host cell, and efficiently produce new viruses. The degenerate genetic code unequally uses synonymous codons, which code for the same amino acid (Cristina et al. 2016; Kanaya et al. 2001; Shackelton et al. 2006; Tsai et al. 2007). The redundancy of the genetic code provides the opportunity to shape the efficiency and accuracy of protein production, while maintaining the same amino acid sequence (Chaney and Clark 2015; Plotkin and Kudla 2011; Stoletzki and Eyre-Walker 2007). Considering that the translation of viral proteins relies on the host's pool of tRNAs, codon usage of a virus must coevolve with its host to efficiently use host resources. It is expected that higher similarity of codon usage pattern will better facilitate their replication.",

Because the virus relies on the host's cellular machinery for its replication, codon usage bias was suggested to play a role in the adaptation of a virus to its host. Codon usage bias is common in viruses (Butt et al. 2014; Castells et al. 2017; Cristina et al. 2016; He et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017; Moratorio et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2016; Su et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2017; Zang et al. 2017; Zhao et al. 2016). Efficient replication seemingly requires that a virus and host have similar codon usage patterns to share a tRNA pool. Co-evolution between a certain RNA virus and its susceptible hosts at codon usages have been observed in many viruses (Franzo et al. 2017; Rahman et al. 2017; Sim\u00f3n et al. 2017).",

Other viruses have narrow host ranges (NSTVs), which can infect a limited number of hosts only. Because BSTVs must fit to multiple hosts and their diverse tRNA pools and their codon usage has a relationship with their host, a tradeoff exists regarding the extent of codon usage. BSTVs must fit to their diverse hosts and, thus, the extent of matching for codon usage would be lower than that of NSTVs, which must fit few, similar hosts. To test this hypothesis, we analyze 255 viruses from 20 genera of positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses (e.g., Flavivirus, Alphavirus, Coronavirus, Torovirus, Arterivirus, Rubivirus, Pestivirus, Hepacivirus, Alphamesonivirus). Viruses that can infect vertebrates and invertebrates, such as most of the Flavivirus and Alphavirus, were classified as BSTVs, while other viruses that can infect either vertebrate or invertebrate were classified as NSTVs.",

Online optimization software (http://genomes.urv.es/OPTIMIZER/) (Puigbo et al. 2007) was utilized.

The use of synonymous codons in gene coding regions dos not occur randomly, and codon usage bias is very common in viruses (Butt et al. 2014; Cristina et al. 2016; He et al. 2017; Moratorio et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2016). Codon usage is among the determinant factors that influence gene expression levels (Chaney and Clark 2015; Zhou et al. 2016). Because viruses do not have tRNAs, and rely on host cell machinery for replication, co-evolution between a certain RNA virus and its susceptible hosts at codon usages have been observed (Franzo et al. 2017; Rahman et al. 2017; Sim\u00f3n et al. 2017). However, ambiguity remains in the co-evolution patterns of different viruses. Some viruses infect a broad range of species (BSTVs), whereas others infect only a single host (NSTVs). Viruses have very diverse hosts, and different hosts have very diverse tRNA pools. The MD and D(A,B) values of NSTVs are significantly higher than those of the BSTVs vs. Anopheles gambiae, Homo sapiens, Gallus gallus, and Macaca mulatta (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Thus, and as our hypothesis predicts, NSTVs appear to be more precisely adapted to their hosts' codon usage pattern and tRNA pools than BSTVs. Each NSTV can infect one host only. Therefore, these viruses need to fit only one host's tRNA pool. They appear to have evolved more consistent codon usage patterns with their hosts' expression systems. In contrast, BSTVs can infect and replicate in mammals, birds, and insects. Thus, adaptation in BSTVs may involve a tradeoff between precise and functional matching to fit the diverse tRNA pools of multiple hosts. This may explain the relatively lower matching of BSTVs to their hosts.",
