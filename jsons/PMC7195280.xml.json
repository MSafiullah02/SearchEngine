Within one month the disease spread far beyond Wuhan, a city with a population of 11 million, and infected nearly ten thousand people in China.1 As the number of infected individuals continued to rise exponentially, China\u2019s closest neighbors such as Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea soon faced the risk of their residents being infected.2 To date, more than 800 individuals in Japan and 8,000 in South Korea have been diagnosed with COVID-19. With early proactive disease surveillance and contact isolation3, Taiwan has had significantly fewer cases, with less than 100 confirmed cases and one death as of March 17, 2020.",

Hence, precautionary measures are necessary especially in radiation oncology departments where patients are present for daily or fractionated treatment (Figure 2\n). Common policies of radiation oncology departments in Taiwan for patients with reported or confirmed COVID-19 include postponing the simulation and scheduling RT after completing the isolation and infection control requirements. The simulation and initiation of RT for patients arriving from Level 3 regions and without COVID-19 symptoms are postponed for 14 days from their entry to Taiwan. In case of urgent medical necessity before completing the 14-day quarantine requirement, patients need to contact Taiwan\u2019s Centers for Disease Control for approval to enter hospital following specific protocols. The quarantine restrictions also apply to scheduled follow-up and new consult patient. For patients coming from Levels 1 and 2 regions in the last 14 days prior to their hospital appointment, the simulation or treatment, with the attending oncologists\u2019 approval, can be scheduled for the end of the day after disinfection of the room. Patients continue to be screened daily, and those with new onset of fever, other flu-like symptoms, or new TOCC history during RT course are referred to the onsite screening station for SARS-CoV-2 tests. Each patient is tested every 24 hours for three consecutive times, with a testing result turnaround of 24 hours. Those with three consecutive negative tests are allowed to resume RT. Some centers may consider hypofractionated regimens for infected individuals in order to finish RT faster, per treating physicians\u2019 discretion. Surgical masks for medical staff in the department are supplied on at least a daily basis and more frequently as needed. Notably, each patient undergoing RT is provided with a new surgical mask daily and is encouraged to wear it in public spaces outside the hospital. The treatment machines and equipment are disinfected between each patient, and treatment facilities are cleaned by trained staff in compliance with recommendations from the hospital\u2019s infection control team.",

Direct contact between members from each subgroup is prohibited. If any member of the subgroup encountered a suspicious COVID-19 case, the whole subgroup undergoes a 14-day quarantine. Meanwhile, other subgroups can still operate the department with the least amount of impact on medical service. Hospital meetings and tumor board conferences are either canceled, reduced in frequency, or take place via online video discussions. With the proactive preventive approaches outline above, there has been no need to reduce clinical staff availability as a way to further reduce human contact and increase social distancing. All hospitals are able to maintain normal workforce to assist patients and provide cross coverage when needed, and there has been no SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the radiation oncology departments in Taiwan.",

            "text": "With initial success in containing COVID-19 spread in Taiwan, impact on RT service is minimal. For example, at the Department of Radiation Oncology at National Taiwan University Hospital, which maintains a daily treatment volume of 300-350 patients in two shifts, the rate of postponing or canceling RT simulations for all causes was 16.9% (73/431) from February 15 to March 15, 2020, comparable to 16.4% (77/471) in the same period in 2019. By providing adequate screening and preventive measures for the patients and staff, there was no need for rationing RT or treatment delay in otherwise uninfected/non-quarantined individuals. Sixty-one inpatient RT consultations were seen from February 15 to March 15, 2020, similar to 57 in the same period in 2019. Two patients were referred to the epidemic screening process and had subsequent negative COVID-19 test results, and no patient undergoing RT had COVID-19. Despite this achievement, there have been unavoidable influences on patients and healthcare professionals. Patients who are concerned about acquiring the infection may choose to postpone clinic visits, despite not having a departmental policy to recommend the delay. In addition, patients who were planned for RT may decide to defer the recommended therapy, especially with palliative or elective treatment.5 The shortage of medical supplies for PPE and fear of getting infected inside hospital buildings make it stressful for both patients and healthcare professionals6\n,\n7. All these impacts might affect the interaction between patients and healthcare professionals,8 influence important decision-making processes, and potentially determine cancer therapy outcome. As COVID-19 evolves into a global pandemic, the risk of community spread in Taiwan could continue to increase. A proposed modified workflow that separates RT patients into different physical waiting/treatment space and \u201czones\u201d in case of increased community spread is presented in Figure 3\n. In addition, the government is considering nationwide screening of all healthcare professionals for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to detected past infection as well as current asymptomatic infections to better triage frontline healthcare workers.",

With lessons learned from the SARS outbreak and concerns for other seasonal infections in a densely populated country as well as air pollution, Taiwanese residents, regardless of their health status, developed the habit of wearing masks in public. Taking all the information into consideration, hospitals have adapted an updated policy to screen high-risk individuals by isolating them in designated areas outside hospital buildings to protect uninfected people and healthcare professionals,10, 11 taking highly hygienic steps by mandating mask-wearing for everyone inside hospital buildings, and disinfecting waiting areas and treatment units between patients. The different strategies between SARS and COVID-19 make the current workflow of fractionated RT cautiously maintained.",
