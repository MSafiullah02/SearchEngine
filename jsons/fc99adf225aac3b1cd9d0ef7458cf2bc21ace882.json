The drug has been studied in detail in the in\u00afuenza A virus infection and the antiviral activity was found to be related to inhibition of viral uncoating and viral budding by interaction with the viral M2 protein [16\u00b118] . The antiviral properties of amantadine have led to clinical trials evaluating the potential therapeutic role of amantadine alone or in combination with interferon-a in patients with chronic hepatitis C [19\u00b123] . For retreatment of previous interferon-a SUMMARY. In primary interferon-a (IFN-a) nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C, retreatment with IFN-a has only limited ef\u00aecacy with sustained response rates below 10%. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to compare the ef\u00aecacy and safety of IFN-a alone or in combination with amantadine sulphate in nonresponders to previous IFN-a monotherapy. Fifty-\u00aeve IFN-a nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C (mean age: 46.6 years) received IFN-a 6 MIU thrice weekly for 24 weeks followed by 3 MIU thrice weekly for additional 24 weeks. Amantadine sulphate (n 26) or a matched placebo (n 29) was given orally twice daily for 48 weeks. Because of a low initial response rate at week 12 (13/55 patients) and a high breakthrough rate (8/13 patients) after IFN-a dose reduction in week 24, a virological end-of-treatment response with undetectable serum HCV-RNA (< 1000 copies/mL) was achieved in only \u00aeve patients (IFN-a/amantadine sulphate, one patient; IFN-a/placebo, four patients). After 24 weeks follow-up a sustained virological response was observed in only two patients receiving IFN-a and placebo. Health-related quality-of-life analysis showed a substantial improvement of the Pro\u00aele of Mood States (POMS) scale concerning the subscales fatigue (P < 0.05) and vigor (P < 0.05) in patients receiving combined IFN-a/amantadine sulphate treatment compared with those treated with IFN-a alone. IFN-a/amantadine sulphate combination therapy was well tolerated without any serious adverse events. In conclusion, retreatment with IFN-a and amantadine sulphate does not increase the low sustained virological response rates of IFN-a therapy in primary IFN-a nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C, but may lead to a sustained improvement of health-related quality-of-life. nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C with the combination of interferon-a and amantadine, only data from a few uncontrolled studies with inconsistent response rates are available [24, 25] .",

This German-validated questionnaire, related to the SF-36 Health Survey, assesses the following six subscales of health-related quality-of-life for subjective health: body (e.g. make demands on body, concentrate on a task), mind (e.g. cope with illness, accept oneself), everyday life (e.g. solve daily problems, personal hygiene), social activity (e.g. get along with family, count on partner's help), zest for life (e.g. enjoy life) and medical treatment (e.g. believe in success of treatment). Sum scores were determined for every patient. Missing items were replaced by the mean for the nonmissing items of the subscales. However, missing questionnaires were not replaced.",

With respect to the low sustained response rates to retreatment with IFN-a alone or in combination with ribavirin in IFN-a nonresponder, the need for the development of alternative, effective retreatment regimens in this subgroup of patients became apparent. In a 1997 published pilot study, a bene-\u00aecial therapeutic effect of six months amantadine retreatment in IFN-a nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C was reported with a sustained biochemical and virological response in four of 22 patients (18%) after a 24 week followup period [19] . The postulated antiviral effect of amantadine was supported in vitro by a dose-dependent decrease of HCV-RNA in the supernatant of isolated blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis C cultured with amantadine [33] . However, in vivo determination of hepatitis C viral load failed to show a direct synergistic antiviral effect of amantadine sulphate during combined IFN-a/amantadine treatment in previously untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C [23] . Subsequently, mainly uncontrolled clinical trials of amantadine monotherapy in small cohorts of nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C showed con\u00aficting results with sustained virological response rates varying from 0% to 15%. As indicated by a recently published pilot study, the combination of IFN-a with amantadine may lead to an improvement of virological response rates in nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C [25] .",
