            "text": "Flaviviruses are a large group of positive-strand RNA viruses classified as a genus, Flavivirus, within the family Flaviviridae, including several medically important, arthropod-borne human pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) (1). Infectious virions are small (\u223c50 nm diameter), lipid-enveloped particles that display 180 copies of the envelope (E) glycoprotein and a small transmembrane protein, M, on their surfaces, surrounding an inner nucleocapsid composed of the viral capsid protein and an unsegmented RNA genome of \u223c11 kb (2, 3). While the surface of flavivirus particles is relatively well-defined, nucleocapsid symmetry has been difficult to discern by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (2, 4). Recent single-particle cryo-EM analysis and icosahedral averaging suggest that Zika virus nucleocapsid is composed of 20 trimers of dimeric capsid protein, loosely held together under the envelope by lateral interactions involving the capsid \u03b15 helix (5). This is surprising, since \u03b15 serves as a signal peptide for translocation of prM into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and must be proteolytically removed by the viral NS2B-3 serine protease in order for prM signal peptidase cleavage to occur, which is required for virus assembly (6\u20138). These results suggest that additional capsid protein dimers lacking \u03b15 helix may be buried within the RNA core.",

NS1 is a secreted glycoprotein that is required for RNA replication; it forms dimers that remain peripherally associated with the inner leaflet of the ER membrane or on the cell surface, as well as secreted hexameric lipoprotein particles that induce strong humoral responses and contribute to flavivirus pathogenesis (3, 11). NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B are polytopic membrane proteins required for RNA replication. NS2B and NS3 form a membrane-anchored enzyme complex with serine protease and RNA helicase activities essential for viral polyprotein processing and RNA replication (3, 12). NS5 is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA capping enzyme (3, 13, 14). Once translated, the NS proteins presumably recruit the viral genome out of translation and into an RNA replication complex.",

On the other hand, intact nucleocapsids can be isolated from detergent-solubilized tick-borne encephalitis virus particles (16); these nucleocapsids dissociate in high salt (0.5 M sodium chloride).

            "text": "A key challenge to studying the early life cycle events of flaviviruses is in detecting the translation of incoming, virion-released genomes. While viruses can be engineered to express sensitive reporter genes, signals produced by translation of the incoming viral genome are soon overwhelmed by translation of genomes produced by RNA replication. Therefore, in order to specifically study early, prereplication events in the life cycle of flaviviruses, we sought to uncouple translation from RNA replication by constructing a YFV strain 17D (YFV-17D) reporter that is conditionally defective for RNA replication. The YFV-17D mutant YFV\u0394SK, which contains a large, in-frame deletion within the essential NS1 gene, is incapable of initiating RNA replication but can be complemented in trans (23). Thus, in the absence of NS1, a YFV\u0394SK-based reporter virus should allow viral entry, fusion, uncoating, and primary translation of the incoming genome to be monitored (Fig. 1A).",

            "text": "First, we constructed a full-length, infectious YFV-17D reporter virus that expresses the nanoluciferase (Nluc) enzyme, based on previously described flavivirus reporter designs (24\u201326). We chose Nluc because of its smaller size (19.1 kDa; 171 codons), enhanced stability, and exquisite sensitivity compared to other luciferases (27). A cassette encoding Nluc, the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A translational-skipping peptide (NFDLLKLAGDVESNPG\u2013P; where \u201c\u2013\u201d signifies the unformed peptide bond), and a ubiquitin monomer (MQIFV\u2026LRGG|; where \u201c|\u201d signifies cleavage by a ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase) was inserted in frame into the YFV-17D infectious clone after the first 25 codons of the YFV-17D C gene, which contains the essential 5\u2032 RNA cyclization sequence (28, 29), followed by the entire YFV polyprotein coding sequence, to generate YFV17D/Nluc (Fig. 1B). After transfection into BHK-21 cells, YFV-17D/Nluc RNA transcripts replicated and gave rise to infectious virus with peak titers similar to wild-type YFV-17D (\u22651 \u00d7 107 PFU/ml at 48 h posttransfection) but had a small plaque phenotype (Fig. 1C). Similar replication impairments have been reported with other flavivirus reporter constructs (26). Nluc expression was stably maintained for at least three serial virus passages in BHK-21 cells; we did not specifically address the long-term stability of the Nluc insert. Based on prior reports of flavivirus insert instability, we expect that Nluc expression will be lost with passage and therefore limited our experiments to early passage virus stocks. Importantly, YFV-17D/Nluc was able to infect and replicate in BHK cells, as observed by the robust accumulation of Nluc activity over time (Fig. 1D). Robust Nluc expression was also observed upon YFV-17D/Nluc infection of other established cell lines, including HEK 293, HeLa, Huh-7.5, SW-13, and primary mouse fibroblasts (data not shown). Furthermore, Nluc expression levels directly correlated with the amount of input virus in an endpoint dilution assay (Fig. 1E); notably, some replicates became Nluc-negative at higher dilutions, indicating that an endpoint had been reached (i.e., some replicate wells received no virus, while other wells received one or a few viruses). Nluc activity was 10- to 100-fold higher in positive wells around the endpoint, which likely received only a single virus particle, than negative wells (Fig. 1E). Based on this, we were able to calculate a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of 3.54 \u00d7 104 TCID50/ml, which was similar to the plaque infectivity titers (3.25 \u00d7 104 PFU/ml) of this same early-harvest (18 h posttransfection), low-titer stock. We consistently noted that virus stocks harvested after cytopathic effects became evident contained significant Nluc activity, presumably due to enzyme release into the conditioned medium by cell lysis. Thus, early virus harvests provided optimal signal/noise ratio without requiring extensive washing during virus inoculation (see Materials and Methods for detailed information). Taken together, these data show that YFV-17D/Nluc is a sensitive reporter virus for measuring YFV-17D replication and gene expression at both early and late times postinfection.",

Upon transfection of RNA transcripts into BHK-21 cells that express YFV NS1 (BHK-NS1), YFV\u0394SK/Nluc replicated, expressed Nluc, and produced infectious virus. YFV\u0394SK/Nluc virus infected BHK-NS1 cells and expressed robust Nluc activity (Fig. 1F, blue circles); however, infection of parental BHK-21 cells, which do not express NS1, led to modest but significant levels of Nluc expression (Fig. 1F, green circles). To confirm that the Nluc activity observed in BHK-21 cells that lack NS1 expression was due to the entry and translation of YFV\u0394SK/Nluc, we performed an additional time course in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX), a potent inhibitor of translation. Nluc expression was detectable as early as 30 min postinfection, increased >10-fold higher than in CHX-treated cells by 90 min postinfection, plateaued by 7 h postinfection, and that Nluc activity persisted for 24 h postinfection (Fig. 1G). Given the tight requirement for NS1 in flavivirus RNA replication, these results demonstrate that YFV\u0394SK/Nluc is a sensitive reporter to measure the translation of incoming viral genomes at early times postinfection.",

First, we sought to determine whether Nluc expression was sensitive to YFV-specific neutralizing antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A, Nluc expression from both YFV-17D/Nluc and YFV\u0394SK/Nluc was neutralized by serum from an IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mouse immunized with YFV-17D, while nonimmune control serum did not neutralize Nluc expression. Similarly, serum from a human YFV-17D vaccinee neutralized both reporter viruses, while pooled human serum did not (Fig. 2B). Together, these data confirm that Nluc expression is dependent on infectivity of the YFV reporter viruses.",

Consistent with this viral entry pathway, expression of Nluc by YFV\u0394SK/Nluc was sensitive to Pitstop2, an inhibitor of clathrin-coated pit formation (Fig. 2C), and to Dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, expression of Nluc by YFV\u0394SK/Nluc was sensitive to ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), a weak base that buffers endolysosomal compartments (Fig. 2E), and to bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of the vacuolar H+-ATPase pump (Fig. 2F). As shown in Fig. 2G, YFV-mediated Nluc expression was sensitive to K784-9103, a small-molecule that binds to DENV E protein and inhibits membrane fusion of DENV and other flaviviruses (31). Furthermore, YFV-mediated Nluc expression was reduced by genetic ablation of LY6E (Fig. 2H), a host factor that facilitates internalization of flaviviruses and other viruses (32, 33), or by RNAi-mediated knockdown of RPLP1 (Fig. 2I), a ribosomal protein required for efficient flavivirus translation (34). These results confirm that YFV/Nluc and YFV\u0394SK/Nluc gene expression are dependent on clathrin, dynamin, LY6E-mediated trafficking, endosomal acidification, and YFV E-mediated fusion, consistent with the known pathways of flavivirus entry.",

As shown in Fig. 3A, expression of Nluc activity during YFV\u0394SK/Nluc infection was blocked by Pyr-41, a potent, specific, and irreversible inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (36), confirming that ubiquitylation is required for an early, prereplication event in the YFV life cycle. To clarify the stage in entry where ubiquitylation is required, we bypassed the viral entry process by directly transfecting YFV\u0394SK/Nluc RNA into BHK cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, Pyr-41 did not inhibit Nluc expression after RNA transfection. These results show that ubiquitylation is required for an early step in YFV entry, upstream of genome release (i.e., uncoating), consistent with the finding that ubiquitylation is required for the disassembly of the DENV nucleocapsid (17).",

The eukaryotic AAA+ ATPase VCP/p97 utilizes energy released from ATP hydrolysis to unfold ubiquitylated client proteins and extract them from larger complexes (18). We therefore tested the hypothesis that VCP/p97 promotes disassembly of the YFV nucleocapsid. As VCP/p97 is an abundant cellular protein, efficient knockdown takes several days to achieve a loss-of-function phenotype, which can cause pleiotropic effects on cells (37). Therefore, in order to specifically examine the role of VCP/p97 in YFV entry we chose two small molecules, DBeQ (an ATP competitor) and NMS-873 (an allosteric inhibitor), which work through different mechanisms of action to potently and specifically inhibit VCP/p97 in a matter of minutes, rather than days (38, 39). DBeQ and NMS-873 potently inhibited Nluc expression after infection with YFV\u0394SK/Nluc virus particles (Fig. 3A) but did not inhibit Nluc expression after transfection of YFV\u0394SK/Nluc RNA (Fig. 3B), indicating that VCP/p97 is necessary for YFV entry, prior to the delivery and translation of incoming YFV genomes.",

Moreover, DBeQ washout bypassed the sensitivity to BafA1, indicating that VCP/p97 functions at a postfusion step of YFV entry. We were unable to perform the converse experiment, washout of BafA1, followed by DBeQ treatment, because BafA1 washout was highly inefficient, consistent with the low nanomolar dissociation constant of this compound (40). Importantly, Pyr-41, DBeQ, NMS-873, and CHX treatments were not toxic under the concentrations and time scales used in our studies (Fig. 3D), indicating that their abilities to block viral gene expression were not simply due to cellular toxicity. Moreover, the expression of a dominant negative allele confirmed that VCP/p97 is required for early YFV gene expression (Fig. 3E).

While working with infectious, radiolabeled virus particles may be inconvenient, the use of high MOIs is potentially more problematic, since aggregates of virus particles can influence the apparent mechanisms of viral entry (43). More recently, the entry of individual, fluorescently labeled flavivirus particles has been visualized at low MOIs through live cell imaging (30, 44\u201346). An important caveat to this approach is that flavivirus preparations typically have relatively low specific infectivities (44, 45, 47), so it is difficult to know whether a given particle under observation is on a pathway toward productive infection.",

Several flavivirus reporter systems have been developed, mainly for high-throughput screening of viral replication (17, 26, 48\u201355). In one remarkable study, Byk et al. adapted a Renilla luciferase-expressing DENV reporter virus to show that the incoming DENV capsid protein must be ubiquitylated prior to viral gene expression (17). However, an important consideration of this experimental design is that flavivirus-encoded reporter genes are continuously expressed, making it difficult to rigorously conclude that reporter activity was translated from an incoming viral genome versus viral RNAs produced by replication, i.e., because both viral entry and RNA replication can contribute to reporter gene expression, the translation of incoming genomes could only be inferred based on the kinetics of when reporter gene expression first became observable. Byk et al. attempted to control for this concern by using CHX to inhibit translation (17); however, CHX inhibits viral gene expression irrespective of whether the genome was delivered by a virus particle or newly synthesized by RNA replication. A further consideration is that reporter enzymes differ in their specific activities; thus, enzymes with low specific activity require higher MOIs to achieve similar sensitivity of early translation events. In this regard, it is notable that Byk et al. did not report the MOIs used in their DENV entry studies; however, several of their experiments used MOIs sufficiently high to allow incoming capsid protein to be detected by Western blotting (17). Despite these minor technical caveats, Byk et al. clearly demonstrated that incoming DENV capsid protein is degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent process and that ubiquitylation is needed before viral gene expression can be detected.",

            "text": "Given these considerations, we sought to build a sensitive YFV reporter specific for detecting translation of incoming viral genomes. First, we used the Nluc reporter gene, which exhibits >100-fold greater specific activity over firefly and Renilla luciferases (56). Second, we created a conditionally replication-defective reporter by incorporating a large, in-frame deletion in the essential NS1 gene, which can be supplied in trans (23, 57). The NS1 glycoprotein, which is expressed within the secretory pathway, contributes to the cytosolic process of RNA replication via interaction with the polytopic NS4A and NS4B membrane proteins, likely within the NS4A-2K-NS4B polyprotein intermediate (58\u201360). NS1 also has distinct membrane alteration properties (59, 61), which likely contribute to replication complex assembly. In the absence of NS1 expression, flavivirus infections are halted prior to replication complex formation and the initial round of RNA synthesis (23, 59, 62, 63). Consistent with this, robust Nluc expression by YFV-17D/Nluc was sensitive to a YFV-specific RNA replication inhibitor, BDAA, while the modest Nluc expression by YFV\u0394SK/Nluc was not. Thus, the YFV\u0394SK/Nluc virus faithfully reports on early, postfusion, prereplication events in the flavivirus life cycle.",

As part of a genome-wide RNAi screen, Krishnan et al. first reported that knockdown of ubiquitin ligase CBLL1 inhibited internalization of WNV particles into HeLa cells and that WNV entry was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors (70). However, these findings were called into question by Fernandez-Garcia et al., who found that the entry of WNV, YFV, and DENV was insensitive to rigorously validated knockdown of CBLL1 or by proteasome inhibitors (71). Furthermore, while JEV entry is also inhibited by proteasome inhibitors (72), these compounds can decrease the cellular pools of free ubiquitin (73\u201375), so the role of ubiquitylation versus proteasome activity in flavivirus entry has been unclear. Byk et al. brought clarity to this issue by demonstrating that ubiquitylation is required for DENV capsid disassembly (17). Furthermore, proteasome activity is dispensable for DENV entry but is responsible for the turnover of incoming capsid protein, presumably after disassembly (17).",

Given that incoming DENV capsid protein is turned over in a proteasome-dependent manner and that inhibition of proteasome activity leads to the accumulation of a slightly higher molecular weight form of capsid protein (17), it is likely that flavivirus capsid proteins are directly ubiquitylated. It is not yet clear how nucleocapsids are targeted for ubiquitylation, nor whether there is a preferred site on capsid protein for this modification. In this regard, DENV mutants lacking lysine residues in the capsid protein were able to infect and translate their genomes normally (17), suggesting that the capsid protein may be ubiquitylated at the N terminus or other noncanonical residue(s) (76). Future work would be needed to identify of the relevant E3 ligase(s) and the type(s) of ubiquitin linkage that modify flavivirus capsid proteins.",

For instance, VCP/p97 dissociates ubiquitylated I\u03baB\u03b1 from NF-\u03baB, activating this transcription factor (77). VCP/p97 contributes to ER-associated degradation by extruding misfolded proteins from the secretory pathway for subsequent delivery to the proteasome (78). Similarly, VCP/p97 contributes to ribosome-associated quality control by extracting misfolded nascent polypeptides from the translation apparatus (79, 80). VCP/p97 has additional roles in extracting client substrates from chromatin, mitochondria, and other large macromolecular complexes. It is worth noting that VCP/p97 has a weak affinity for ubiquitin and relies on a large array of cofactors, which typically encode enzymatic activities to facilitate VCP/p97 substrate processing, or adaptor molecules, which simply link VCP/p97 to client substrates. Each of these adaptors and cofactors carry binding surfaces that recognize VCP/p97 and ubiquitin, respectively (81, 82). Thus, VCP/p97 contributes to diverse cellular functions based this modular cofactor- and adaptor-mediated targeting strategy.",

As mentioned above, direct evidence for ubiquitylation of incoming flavivirus capsid protein is currently lacking, although capsid is degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Although we have illustrated free nucleocapsids within the cytosol, we cannot exclude the possibility that fusion is tightly coupled to capsid ubiquitylation and disassembly, such that nucleocapsids may be ubiquitylated and disassembled as they are exposed to the cytosol. Consistent with our model, VCP/p97 activity was previously shown to be important for WNV, JEV, and DENV infection, although specific role(s) for VCP/p97 in virus entry were not determined (53, 83). Similarly, VCP/p97 is also important for an early step, upstream of N-protein degradation, during the entry of infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus (84). VCP/p97 also contributes to productive trafficking of NRAMP2, a cellular receptor for the entry of Sindbis virus, an alphavirus (85). Thus, VCP/p97 appears to play a general role in the entry of enveloped RNA viruses and may also contribute to RNA replication of alphaviruses (86) and hepaciviruses (87, 88). Given these findings, it will be interesting to determine whether VCP/p97 inhibitors have therapeutic potential in viral infections.",
