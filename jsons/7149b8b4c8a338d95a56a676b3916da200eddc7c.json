            "text": "In the past, toroviruses, a subfamily of the order Nidovirales, were mainly known to cause 64 enteric disease in mammals (1) (2)(3)(4). Recent studies linked nidovirus infections to respiratory 65 disease in cattle, pythons, and lizards, thus establishing nidoviruses as respiratory pathogens (5-66 12). In pythons, nidoviruses were found to be associated with chronic proliferative pneumonia 67 (5, 6, 10, 11), and the association was confirmed by experimental infection studies (7). Severe 68 cases exhibit typical pathological changes both after experimental and natural infection; these 69 include stomatitis, rhinitis, tracheitis, and pneumonia with significant mucus accumulation. 70 Taxonomically, python nidoviruses have recently been reclassified into the family 71 Tobaniviridae, subfamily Serpentovirinae, genus Pregotovirus (International Committee on 72 Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), https://talk.ictvonline.org (July 2018)). 73 A recent study identified yet another new novel nidovirus (genus Barnivirus) in Bellinger River 74 snapping turtles (Myuchelys georgesi). The infection was associated with necrotizing cystitis, 75 nephritis, adenitis and vasculitis, and the presence of viral RNA in many tissues, indicating 76 systemic spread of the virus (12). The target cell spectrum of python nidoviruses includes the 77 epithelium of the respiratory tract and lungs (6), and in some cases also the oral cavity and the 78 cranial esophagus (5-7, 11), the mucosa of which exhibits ciliated epithelium in snakes (13).",

All of the 370 tested animals were found positive for nidovirus infection (Table 1) Table 1 ), and a necrotzing splenitis (CH-A1 and CH-C4, Table 1 ) and fibrinonecrotic enteritis 380 with intralesional coccoid bacterial colonies (E-B1, Table 1 ). Both conditions are likely a 381 consequence of debilation/dehydration due to chronic pulmonary disease. In our study, no differences were noted between the python species in the degree and distribution which has an impact on the blood gas exchange (40). In some snakes, we additionally observed 435 an esophagitis; this is interpreted as a consequence of overspill and swallowing of virus-laden 436 mucus, a theory also supported by previous studies (6, 7, 40) . It is possible that the esophagus is Table 1 . Animals, clinical signs, lesions and viral target cells. All animals were from breeding collections in Switzerland (CH) or Spain (E). Breeders CH A-C and CH-F were working closely together, trading/exchanging snakes.",

In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an 30 inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and 31 often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions 32 in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 33 nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain.34The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with35 previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation 36 of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. 37 Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein 38 demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and 39 alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular 40 monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we 41 obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of 42 viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or 43 systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python 44 nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection 45 could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a 46 consequence of monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus. 47 IMPORTANCE 49 During the last years, python nidoviruses have become a primary cause of fatal disease in 50 pythons. Nidoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and 51 can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from 52 previously evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the 53 entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a 54 variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise 55 important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as the recently 56 emerged SARS-CoV-2. Python nidoviruses belong to the same subfamily as the mentioned 57 human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal 58 tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better 59 understand the complexity of viruses of the order nidovirales.",

The examination a revealed broad target cell 212 spectrum and nidovirus-associated cytopathic effect.213    Oral cavity and respiratory tract. The respiratory tract was found to be affected in all animals 214 (100%), with a variable distribution of viral infection and lesions. In 10 animals (33%), the nasal 215 and oral cavities were affected and exhibited multifocal extensive epithelial necrosis with diffuse 216 subepithelial infiltration of the adjacent, partly hyperplastic respiratory and squamous epithelium 217 by numerous heterophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. Lesions were 218 occasionally covered with fibrin, degenerated epithelial cells and heterophils (fibrinonecrotic 219 rhinitis and stomatitis;Fig. 1C). Nidovirus NP was abundantly expressed in numerous unaltered and degenerated oral and nasal epithelial cells(Fig. 1D). In two euthanized carpet pythons (CH-221 B1 and -B2,Table 1), these were the only pathological changes, suggesting that they represented 222 early (initial) lesions. The latter is further supported by the fact that in one of the two individuals223 (CH-B1) nidovirus NP was also detected in a few individual respiratory epithelial cells in the 224 trachea, some trabecular pseudostratified lung epithelial cells, and occasional type I pneumocytes 225 lining the faveolar space (Fig. 5A), without evidence of cell damage or inflammation. Two ball 226 pythons with fibrinonecrotic rhinitis and stomatitis (E-B1 and -B3) also exhibited a diffuse 227 chronic tracheitis with subepithelial infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and 228 occasional heterophils, but no further lesions in the lower respiratory tract. 229 The remaining snakes showed histological evidence of nidovirus-associated proliferative disease 230 with epithelial hyperplasia in the nasal cavity, trachea, and lung, as well as mucus and 231 inflammatory cells filling the faveolar space, consistent with our earlier findings (6). Nidovirus 232 NP expression was seen in the pseudostratified epithelium of the primary trabeculae and in type I 233 and type II pneumocytes of the faveolar space; the extent and distribution varied between 234 animals. 235 Alimentary tract. In addition to the respiratory changes, several individuals (CH-A1 and -A9, 236 CH-B6, CH-D1 and -D2, CH-C4, CH-E; carpet pythons, green tree pythons, ball pythons and a 237 black-headed python) exhibited a severe multifocal fibrinonecrotic esophagitis (Fig. 1E, F) with 238 abundant nidovirus-infected intact and degenerate squamous epithelial cells. The gross intestinal 239 lesions observed in another four cases (CH-A7, and -A8, CH-B6, CH-F1) were indeed nidovirus-240 induced, since all exhibited a multifocal fibrinonecrotic enteritis with nidovirus NP expression in 241individual intact and degenerating enterocytes(Fig. 2C, D).242 Vascular involvement, systemic spread and systemic granulomatous and/or fibrinonecrotizing 243disease. In all snakes with the above-described intestinal changes (CH-A7 and -A8, CH-B6, CH-244 F1), the mucosal lesions were found to overlie focal inflammatory processes in the intestinal wall. These were represented by multifocal (pyo)granulomatous perivascular infiltrates of 246 macrophages and fewer heterophils and lymphocytes which were predominantly seen in the 247 submucosa in close proximity to the gut associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) but occasionally 248 extended into the tunica muscularis(Fig. 2C, E). These lesions contained abundant nidovirus NP 249 in infiltrating macrophages(Fig. 2D, F). Occasional affected vessels also exhibited fibrinoid 250 degeneration of the wall with intramural heterophil infiltration. A multifocal pyogranulomatous 251 vasculitis and perivasculitis of small, medium-sized and large veins and arteries was also seen in 252 the serosa of various organs, e.g. the heart, the lung and the thymus, of four snakes (CH-A7, CH-253 B6, CH-C3, CH-F1)(Fig. 4 C, D). Here, nidovirus NP was not only detected in macrophages of 254 the infiltrates, but also in endothelial cells, which often appeared to be activated(Fig. 2F), and in 255 mononuclear cells in the vessel lumina(Fig. 2F, 4A). Staining for the monocyte/macrophage 256 marker Iba-1 showed that the mononuclear cells in the vessel lumina were predominantly Iba-1 257 positive, i.e. monocytes(Fig. 4B). The latter finding suggests monocyte-associated viremia, and 258 viral spread via infected monocytes.259Interestingly, all animals with the described vascular lesions were green tree pythons (CH-A7, 260 CH-B6, CH-C3, CH-F1) and also exhibited multifocal pyogranulomatous lesions, which 261 consisted of a central area of necrosis, surrounded by virus-laden macrophages(Fig. 4 C, D).262Affected organs included the kidneys, thymus, heart and liver, and in one animal (CH-C3) the263 lung. One green tree python (CH-F1) also exhibited pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic 264 lesions in the oviduct, with nidovirus NP found cell-free in necrotic debris. This was seen 265 together with a fibrinous coelomitis in the caudal coelomic cavity, adjacent to the inflamed 266 oviduct. Pyogranulomatous lesions varied in distribution and extent between individuals, but 267 were always present in more than one organ. There was no evidence of bacteria within the 268 lesions. Animals with pyogranulomatous lesions often showed nidovirus NP in epithelia adjacent to the inflammatory foci (e.g. pancreatic ducts, renal tubules etc.) without any evidence of 270 degeneration or necrosis (Fig. 5B, C). 271 Overall, fibrinonecrotic lesions were observed in five green tree pythons (CH-A1 and -A7, CH-272 B6, CH-C3, CH-F1) and one carpet python (CH-B1). They were represented by diffuse necrosis 273 and fibrin exudation in parenchymatous organs (spleen, thymus) or on the serosal surface of the 274 coelomic cavity (in close proximity to affected organs) with minimal inflammatory response 275 (Fig. 4E and F). These lesions were often observed in animals with nidovirus-associated 276 perivascular/vascular and/or pyogranulomatous lesions, indicating massive systemic spread of 277 the virus. 278 Infection of epithelial cells and ependyma. As described, nidovirus NP was detected in various 279 types of epithelial cells, often in close proximity to granulomatous or fibrinonecrotic lesions and 280 without evidence of a cytopathic effect. Affected epithelial cells included type I and type II 281 pneumocytes of the lung, epithelial cells of renal tubules and pancreatic ducts, mesothelial cells 282 (Fig. 5A-C) and hepatocytes (Fig. 3D).

            "text": "405of nidovirus-associated respiratory disease. However, it is interesting to note that all animals406    with systemic viral spread (indicated by disseminated granulomatous and/or fibrinonecrotic 407 lesions, [peri]vascular lesions, infected monocytes etc.) were of the genus Morelia. The results suggest increased susceptibility of snakes from this genus to nidovirus infection and/or disease, a 409 finding also supported by recent epidemiologic studies (14). In support, the analysis of the viral 410 genomes by NGS did not show differences in the viral genome that would explain the 411 differences in the disease manifestation. One could speculate that each python species has its 412 own nidovirus, and that cross-species transmission of the viruses results in morbidity. Should413 pythons (or snakes in general) indeed be hosts for nidoviruses, then a co-infection with an 414 unidentified bacterial or viral agent could also explain the sudden emergence of fatal pneumonia 415 cases in captive snakes. An alternative explanation for the emergence of nidovirus infections in 416 python collections could be that there have been multiple nidovirus introductions to various 417 python species from an unknown host species or a vector. 418 Recently, experimental infection of ball pythons established the causal relationship between 419 nidovirus infection and mucinous inflammation of the upper respiratory and the gastrointestinal 420 tract as the main pathological process early, i.e. within the first 12 weeks, after infection (7).421 Infected pythons showed severe respiratory distress with only minimal pneumonia, most likely 422 because the mucus overproduction resulted in obstruction of the upper airways (7). These 423 findings correlate with those we made when studying naturally infected cases; some animals 424 were submitted for euthanasia due to acute respiratory distress, but only exhibited inflammatory 425 processes in nasal and oral cavity, without histologic evidence of tracheitis or pneumonia. In all 426 other naturally infected animals, rhinitis, stomatitis and tracheitis were present, as well as a 427 variable degree of proliferative pneumonia, indicating longer duration and a more progressed 428 stage of the disease. On that note, the anatomic structure of the snake lung has to be considered, 429 as studies on Burmese pythons have shown that python lungs provide excess capacity for oxygen 430 exchange. This leads to progressive spread of respiratory infections through the lung, thereby 431 continuously reducing respiratory gas exchange without causing clinical signs. The latter will 432 develop only when the oxygen exchange capacity falls below the requirements of the metabolic rate. This is particularly relevant in association with hyperplasia of the pulmonary epithelium, 434",

            "text": "Similar to python nidoviruses, mammalian toroviruses (found in horses, swine and cattle) belong441 to the family Tobaniviridae and have a worldwide distribution (43). Epidemiologic studies are 442 sparse, yet seroprevalence seems to be high in affected populations. For example, the 443 seroprevalence to porcine torovirus (PToV) exceeds 95 % in swine populations, and is 94 % in 444 cattle (Breda virus) (44) and 38% in horses (Berne virus) (45). Neutralizing antibodies to Berne 445 virus (equine torovirus) have also been detected in goats, pigs, rabbits, and some species of wild 446 mice. Equine and porcine toroviruses are generally associated with asymptomatic enteric 447 infections, and transmission is probably via the oral/nasal route through contact with feces (46) 448 or nasopharyngeal secretions (47). However, torovirus infection has been associated with 449 neonatal and postweaning diarrhea in swine (48) and severe diarrheal disease in cattle (49).450 In our study nidovirus RNA was detected in choanal and cloacal swabs of individuals presenting 451 with either the respiratory (local) or systemic form of the disease. This correlates with studies on 452 human SARS-CoV-2, where viral RNA was detected not only in throat swabs but also in stool 453 samples (50). Viral shedding via the feces in pythons without intestinal lesions could likely be a 454 consequence of the swallowing of mucus. Therefore, besides the respiratory (aerosol) route, the 455 fecal-oral route also appears to be a likely way of transmission in pythons. The literature 456 suggests that mammalian coronaviruses have a limited host cell tropism and affect either the 457 intestinal or the alveolar epithelium (6, 7, 10, 11, 47, 51-53). This seems not to apply to python nidoviruses for which the results of the present study indicate a rather broad cell tropism, for 459 various types of epithelia (respiratory and pulmonary epithelium, enterocytes, hepatocytes, 460 epithelial cells in renal tubules and pancreatic ducts) and ependymal cells. Interestingly, a similar 461 tendency is described for SARS-CoV-2 (54). Previous studies on python nidoviruses have hinted 462 at a broader target cell spectrum, but did so far not go beyond the detection of nidovirus RNA in 463 organs other than the respiratory tract (10), and did neither identify infected cells nor correlate 464 infection with actual organ lesions. 465 Of particular interest is the fact that python nidoviruses also infect non-epithelial cells distributed 466 over the entire body. We detected nidovirus NP in endothelial cells, intravascular monocytes and 467 extravascular macrophages within inflammatory processes. The latter suggest that monocytes 468 facilitate the systemic spread of the virus. So far, viruses of the subfamily Tobaniviridae have 469 not been reported to infect monocytes/macrophages. However, monocyte/macrophage infection 470 is known to be a key process in the pathogenesis of other members of the order Nidovirales, such 471 as feline coronaviruses (FCoV) (55), ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) (56) and Severe 472 Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (57). For FCoV, the ability to infect, 473 replicate in and activate monocytes and macrophages is essential in the pathogenesis of feline 474 infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal disease of felids. While the low-virulence feline enteric 475 coronavirus (FECV) biotype primarily replicates in enterocytes and does only induce mild 476 enteric disease, the highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) biotype 477 predominantly arises after S gene mutations in FECV of the infected host that allow efficient 478 replication in and systemic spread with monocytes (58). This allows rapid dissemination of the 479 virus throughout the body (monocyte-associated viremia) and is a prerequisite of the monocyte 480 activation with subsequent development of the granulomatous phlebitis that is the hallmark of 481 FIP (55, 59, 60). A similar mechanism is likely for ferrets with a comparable disease and for 482 experimental infections of IFN-\u03b3 knock-out mice with Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) (56, 61). Similar to cats with FIP, systemically nidovirus-infected pythons exhibited a multifocal 484 macrophage-dominated vasculitis which was in severe cases associated with fibrinoid necrosis of 485 the vessel wall, but also appeared as chronic perivascular (pyo)granulomatous cuffs with 486 abundant nidovirus-positive macrophages. These vascular lesions could result from an 487 interaction between activated nidovirus-infected monocytes and endothelial cells, in particular 488 since the latter were also found to become infected. They might also be responsible for the broad 489 spectrum of granulomatous to fibrinonecrotic lesions in organs, since these might at least partly 490 be of ischemic nature. 491 Sequencing of the nidovirus genomes did not reveal variants that would be associated with the 492 systemic infection observed in some individuals. The genome length and relatively high 493 mutation and recombination rate of nidoviruses makes identification of mutations that might 494 alter the pathogenesis of the virus rather challenging. The S protein is the precursor of the spike 495 complex that mediates receptor binding and entry, and thus mutations in the S protein could most 496 easily explain the differences in tissue tropism (62). However, we did not identify S protein 497 mutations that would explain the different phenotypes. One could thus speculate that the 498 different infection outcome is a consequence of differences in the host immune response. 499 During viral infections of mammals, viruses are recognized by pattern recognition receptors 500 (PRRs) which induce a type I interferon (IFN) response, mediated by IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2. The IFN 501 response is considered the primary host defense mechanism against viral infections. It is 502 therefore not surprising that many viruses have developed mechanisms to subvert or alter the 503 type I IFN response (61). Interference of nidoviruses with the IFN response has so far mainly 504 been investigated in the family Coronaviridae. In studies on human SARS-CoV infection the 505 presence of viral proteins in monocytes was not found to be associated with significant IFN-\u03b1 506 production and it was suggested that viral particles had been taken up by monocytes via 507 phagocytosis. This correlates with studies on IFN receptor deficient knock-out mice where MHV infection was associated with higher viral titers and a broader tissue tropism of the virus (61Python nidovirus disease.
