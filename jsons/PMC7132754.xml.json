A negative result from all 3 methods was considered to be a true negative.

A positive result from only RV15 with a negative result from RV16 was considered to be a false positive. A positive result from AdvanSure only was confirmed with RV16. In case of a positive result from AdvanSure only with a negative result from RV16, another confirmatory test, singleplex PCR and sequencing, was performed. The main outcomes of this study were sensitivities and specificities of culture, AdvanSure\u2122, and RV 15 assay. Because culture cannot detect human rhinovirus (HRV), MPV, coronavirus, and bocavirus, we excluded HRV, MPV, coronavirus, and bocavirus results from the sensitivity analysis of culture. Specificity was calculated as the percentage of the number of target virus-negative specimens by each assay against the number of target virus-negative specimens by composite reference standard. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 20.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).",

Bocavirus was always detected with other viruses (9/9, 100%). Seven coronavirus (70%) was co-detected with other viruses among 10 coronavirus-positive cases. In the previous study analyzing multiple viral respiratory infections among 225 childcare attendees, viruses frequently coinfected with bocavirus were adenovirus, coronavirus, and HRV (Martin et al., 2013). Similarly, in this study, bocaviruses presented most frequently with adenoviruses (77.8%, 7/9). Our result that all of bocavirus-infected samples were coinfected supports the claim that the development of human bocavirus pathogenicity may require its reciprocal interaction with other coinfecting viruses (Zhang et al., 2012).",
