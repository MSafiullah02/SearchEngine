This is especially important for women of child-bearing age who may be exposed to diseases such as varicella and erythema infectiosum. If available, a negative pressure room should be designated as an isolation room for patients with respiratory pathogens, and exposed susceptible individuals should be furloughed during the incubation period.2\n,\n3 Large health care organizations often address these issues during in-processing of employees, but many dermatologists practice in private clinics and should review existing policies to prepare for the inevitability of contagious patients entering the clinic.",
