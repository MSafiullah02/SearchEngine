Nonetheless, the relationship has only recently been emphasized through the One Health Initiative, which promotes coequal collaborations between practitioners and researchers in human and comparative medicine, as well as surveillance programs in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. An important catalytic event for the Initiative was the West Nile virus outbreak in New York City in 1999, where two independent lines of research investigation converged\u2014one focused on high mortality in native corvids (including crows) and exotic birds in the Bronx Zoo that ultimately led to the culture and identification of the virus by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and another focused on human encephalitis cases. These were initially attributed to St. Louis encephalitis virus but found to be West Nile virus when brain material of victims underwent DNA sequence analysis by a team composed of investigators at the University of California and the New York State Department of Health.1 Retrospective analysis indicated that the cause of the human outbreak would have been ascertained earlier if the veterinary and medical practitioners had collaborated in sharing data and samples. A series of national and international meetings culminated in the One Health Resolution signed by the presidents of the American Medical Association and American Veterinary Medical Association, with endorsement by the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the European Union.",

The route of transmission can vary even for the same virus. Whereas in Malaysia, farm workers became infected with Nipah virus through exposure to pigs that had consumed contaminated droppings of frugiverous bats, in Bangladesh, where pigs are not farmed, human Nipah virus infection has been associated with consumption of palm sap beverages contaminated by bats. In North America, silver-haired bats transmit rabies virus via a bite wound. Humans are typically infected by filoviruses through exposure to infected primate meat; however, there are instances in which infection may have occurred through consumption of infected bats or exposure to bat excreta in close quarters (e.g., caves and abandoned mines). The SARS coronavirus is presumed to have entered the human population through intermediate species (civets) in live-animal markets. We do not yet know the path for human infection of the most recent coronavirus that emerged in the Middle East. Although there are examples of human-to-human transmission of filoviruses and henipaviruses through contact with blood or other bodily fluids, the only bat-associated pathogen that is known to have established efficient transmission within the human population is the SARS coronavirus.",

Vaccines have been effective in preventing disease in animal models of Ebola and Marburg virus infection; monoclonal antibodies may reduce morbidity and mortality in disease caused by Nipah and Hendra viruses. Rabies is typically fatal once the virus enters the central nervous system; however, postexposure prophylaxis is effective, particularly when the exposed individual receives not only vaccine but also rabies immune globulin injected in proximity to the puncture wound.",

They are the largest order of mammals, comprising more than 2200 species, and are implicated in transmission of both viruses and bacteria. The rodent-associated arenaviruses (named for their sandy appearance by electron microscopy; arena means sand in Latin) that cause human disease include Lassa fever virus, endemic in western Africa; lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, found in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres; and several South American viruses, including Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, and Sabia (see Chapter 169). Another African arenavirus, Lujo virus, is presumed, but not proven, to have a rodent reservoir. Lassa fever is clinically similar to the infections caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses; however, whereas Lassa fever virus infection may be asymptomatic in up to 80% of cases, asymptomatic filovirus infection is uncommon. The South American arenaviruses can cause hemorrhagic fever but can also be associated with asymptomatic infection. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has been implicated in aseptic meningitis and birth defects, particularly in the central nervous system. Although there is no specific drug for arenavirus infection, the nucleoside analogue ribavirin may have efficacy. Passive immunotherapy with hyperimmune plasma has been useful in Argentinean hemorrhagic fever (Junin virus infection).",

Infection is correlated with potential for exposure; hence, leptospirosis is common year-round in the tropics and during warm wet months in temperate climate zones (see Chapter 241). Food markets, particularly those where rodents congregate and where there is opportunity for blood from infected animals to contaminate standing water, are high-risk environments for contraction of disease. The onset of disease is heralded by nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and headache. The illness may progress to meningitis, vasculitis, renal and liver failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

HFRS is more common in Africa, Asia, and Europe. HPS has only been reported in North America. There is no hantavirus-specific drug or vaccine. Recovery from HFRS is not uncommon with supportive care; however, HPS is typically fatal. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, a nairovirus, is distributed throughout Asia and Africa. A wide range of small mammals may serve as reservoirs; domestic sheep, goats, cattle, and horses are typically intermediate hosts.

Thus, human transmission is most common in suburban and rural areas, particularly where the density of vegetation is sufficiently thick to harbor large concentrations of rodents. Diagnosis is straightforward in the presence of the characteristic rash, when there is history of travel or exposure to an endemic area and a tick bite.

BSE was first identified in the United Kingdom in 1986 and peaked in incidence in 1993. The original infection is presumed to have been introduced when cattle were fed with offal from infected sheep or cows. An estimated 400,000 cows with BSE are estimated to have entered the food chain before the outbreak was terminated by culling cattle with behavior indicative of BSE, reducing the age of slaughter (so that titers would be lower in the event an infected animal was inadvertently used for human consumption), and eliminating the practice of feeding animal products to ruminants in 1997. At least 227 people exposed to BSE contracted vCJD. Susceptibility to this disease is determined at least in part by the prion protein (PrP) genotype. The peak incidence of vCJD was observed in 2000 and tapered thereafter. Some investigators predict that a large wave of new cases is unlikely in the absence of recurrence of BSE. However, others note that the incubation of kuru, a prion disorder associated with ritual cannibalism, may be as long as 27 years. The diagnosis of vCJD is made using brain or tonsillar biopsy based on histology and/or the presence of protease-resistant PrP. There is no effective treatment or vaccine for prion diseases.",

Influenza is not typically considered a zoonotic disease because human-to-human transmission is efficient; however, both birds and pigs play key roles in the maintenance of existing strains and the emergence of new ones. Only influenza A viruses are associated with pandemic disease, presumably because they have a higher propensity to evolve toward antigenic diversity and thus evade host immune surveillance than influenza B and C viruses. Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts of the classic seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2. Infection of free-range pigs by migrating aquatic birds or in live-animal markets, where they may be housed near aquatic birds, can lead to genetic reassortment (when more than one type of influenza virus is present) and adaptation to humans. H5N1, popularly known as avian influenza, only rarely results in human disease but is frequently fatal when it does. A wide range of diagnostic assays is available for detection of influenza viruses. Vaccines are designed twice each year to reflect strains predicted to predominate during the influenza season in the Southern and Northern Hemisphere. Their efficacy fluctuates with the accuracy of those predictions but, as a rule, is less effective in inducing a protective immune response in the elderly. Efforts are underway to create universal influenza vaccines based on conserved regions of the virus hemagglutinin, rather than those that evolve to evade the immune system. The drug oseltamivir is effective for many strains.",

EEEV is found throughout North, Central, and South America but is concentrated in the United States east of the continental divide. WEEV is found in the western United States. VEEV is found primarily in Central and South America. All are associated primarily with an influenza-like illness but may, in a small proportion of cases, progress to encephalitis. West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that was associated with only mild, sporadic disease until the 1990s, when virulent strains appeared first in Europe and then in North America.
