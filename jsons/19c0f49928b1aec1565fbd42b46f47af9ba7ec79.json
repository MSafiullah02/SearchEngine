PHE has provided a template 'Healthy Weight Environments Supplementary Planning document' which can be used as a starting point for local public health teams to liaise with planning officers and other local authority teams, including environmental health, licensing, transport, and leisure. This guidance provides practical support to those local authorities looking to develop policies and approaches to promote a healthy weight environment.",

PHE wants to support consistent whole system approaches, including the use of the planning system. This publication is designed to help achieve that. This policy to implementation lag has to be seen in the context of an increasing obesity challenge (See Figure 2 ) facing society. This context can be understood both in terms of prevalence in certain age groups such as children, and concentration of obesogenic environments in certain neighbourhoods which are helping to widen health inequalities. This was recognised within the Childhood Obesity; a plan for action Chapter 2. The challenges it identified, included the proliferation of fast food outlets, less active travel, limited access to green spaces and physical activity; and these factors create an environment that makes it harder for children and their families to make healthy choices, particularly in some of our most deprived areas. The Childhood Obesity plan confirmed that local authorities have a key role in tackling this challenge and pledged support;",
