            "text": "Amiodarone is a cationic antiarrhythmic drug extensively used for the control of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Its action mechanism includes blockade of K- and Na channels and interference with \u03b2-adrenoreceptors and Ca currents [1], [2]. Amiodarone has a large volume of distribution (66 l/kg), steady state serum levels between 0.7 and 3.7 \u03bcM, an elimination half-life of several weeks and a propension to accumulate in different tissues, like adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and the liver, but not in the brain [3], [4], [5]. Recent evidence suggests that accumulation in tissues might happen by at least two mechanisms, that is the association with cell membranes, due to the high lypophilicity of amiodarone, and trapping in the lumen of acidic organelles after protonation of the amine function present in the lateral group diethylamino-\u03b2-ethoxy [6], [7]. Amiodarone catabolism includes stepwise dealkylation and deamination of the lateral group diethylamino-ethoxy, major metabolite being N-desethylamiodarone (MDEA) whose activity and serum levels are similar to those of the parent drug [8]. Chronic exposure to amiodarone induces the formation of vacuoles and inclusion bodies in blood leukocytes, cells of the corneal epithelium, skin cells, alveolar macrophages, liver cells and cardiomyocytes [7]. Although there is agreement that these structures derive from interference of amiodarone with the endocytic pathway, there is uncertainty about the set of endocytic organelles involved, the mechanism of formation of vacuoles and the origin of materials, both amorphous and membrane-like, accumulating in the lumen of inclusion bodies.",

            "text": "Regarding the section of the endocytic pathway involved, it has been claimed that amiodarone does not interfere with early compartments of the endocytic pathway, since the drug does not modify the distribution of the early endosomal marker EEA1 [6]. However this issue remains undecided, since some found no interference of amiodarone with the activity of diphtheria toxin, whose active moiety enters the cytoplasm from early endosomes [9], while others found that amiodarone inhibits the toxin [10]. On the other side several lines of evidence suggest that amiodarone interferes with late compartments of the endocytic pathway. In fact, (i) vacuoles and inclusion bodies bear the markers of late endosomes/lysosomes, like Rab7 and CD63 [6], [7], (ii) patients treated with amiodarone accumulate in the airways lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), also known as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate [11], which is a component of late endosome lumenal membranes [12], (iii) amiodarone inhibits in vitro the activity of the anthrax toxin, whose subunits (edema factor and lethal factor) enter the cytoplasm from late endosomes/multivesicular bodies [10], [13]. Thus far it is unknown whether amiodarone interferes with recycling endosomes or with the pathway connecting directly early endosomes with the Golgi. Nor is it known if amiodarone interferes with the ESCRT complex, a highly conserved set of proteins associated with a specialized portion of the early endosomes, necessary for the formation of lumenal vesicles and the eventual maturation of this compartment into multivesicular bodies [14]. The ESCRT system is also involved in membrane deformations topologically equivalent to endovesiculation, like cytokinesis and the budding of membrane bound viruses [14]. Interestingly mutations of the ESCRT system lead to phenotypes characterized by the presence of vacuoles and inclusion bodies bearing markers of both early and late endosomes [14].",

Interestingly in Niemann-Pick type C cells accumulating lipids not only are a manifestation of disturbed traffic, but also play a pathogenetic role, since alleviation of the phenotype can be obtained by decreasing cholesterol levels [21], by inhibiting glycosphingolipid synthesis [22] or by increasing lipid degradation [23]. Very recently it has been shown that Niemann-Pick type C cells try to combat cholesterol accumulation by increasing the secretion of exosomes[24], which are vesicles located in the lumen of late endosomes/multivesicular bodies destined to be secreted rather than to be destroyed [25]. We speculated that, as it happens in Niemann-Pick type C disease, increased LBPA levels observed in patients treated with amiodarone might point to a more complex disturbance in the homeostasis of cell lipids.",

These included transferrin recycling, ESCRT functionality (by evaluation of lentiviruses budding) and the pathway connecting early endosomes with the Golgi complex probed with Shiga toxin 1, which after processing within early endosomes, moves to the Golgi through vesicular intermediates [26]. Furthermore we analyzed the effect of amiodarone on the secretion of exosomes and on the distribution of lipids trafficking through late endosomes/lysosomes, like LBPA, cholesterol, sphingomyelin and glycosphyngolipids. Besides this, since vacuoles may reflect a disorder in fluid phase endocytosis, we studied the effect of amiodarone on the traffic of a non-degradable sugar. Finally we correlated the physico-chemical properties of amiodarone analogues with effects on the distribution of LBPA and on the ability to degrade imported proteins. In particular the analogues studied included dronedarone, an amiodarone derivative recently introduced in clinical practice [27].",

These changes recall the Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) phenotype, but originate through a different mechanism, since they are not alleviated by cholesterol removal, while cells treated with NPC-phenotype inducer U18666A revert to the normal after reduction of the cholesterol load. Studies with analogues indicate that high water-solubility at acidic pH is a crucial requirement for the interference with late endosomes/lysosomes and that, in this respect, dronedarone is at least as potent as amiodarone.",

Since the effect of amiodarone on the distribution of LBPA at the cell level has never been studied, BHK cells were incubated with 0\u201310 \u03bcM amiodarone for 16 h and the distribution of LBPA was analyzed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A, in control cells LBPA presented as puncta with a juxtanuclear distribution, consistent with its association with late endosomes. In the presence of amiodarone, LBPA-positive structures decreased in number, increased in diameter and changed distribution from juxtanuclear to peripheral (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis indicated that the change in number and diameter of LBPA-positive structures was concentration dependent and was significant at 2 \u03bcM amiodarone, a concentration commonly found in the serum of chronically treated patients (Fig. 1B). MDEA, the main metabolite of amiodarone, which reaches serum concentrations close to those of the parent drug [8], was more powerful than amiodarone and the combination 2 \u03bcM amiodarone plus 2 \u03bcM MDEA, affected LBPA distribution similarly to 10 \u03bcM amiodarone (Fig. 1A, B). The effect on the distribution of LBPA was reproducible. In 5 independent experiments in which cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcM amiodarone for 16 h, the number of LBPA-rich structures per cell profile decreased by 69.0 \u00b1 4.5% and their diameter increased by 42.6 \u00b1 5.2% (p\n < 0.01 for both differences).",

Fig. 2 also shows that changes in the distribution of LBPA were attenuated by inhibiting microtubule polymerization with nocodazole and could be prevented by treatment with ammonium chloride. Since alkalinization inhibits the accumulation of amiodarone, while nocodazole has no effect on the association of amiodarone with target cells [6], [7], we conclude that: (a) amiodarone induces fusion of organelles rich in LBPA, (b) the process is cytoskeleton-dependent and reversible, (c) alkalinization prevents fusion by inhibiting the accumulation of amiodarone within target cells, (d) although amiodarone increases the pH of acidic organelles [6], lumenal alkalinization by itself has no role in the re-distribution of LBPA, (f) the effect on LBPA distribution suggests that amiodarone interferes with late compartments of the endocytic pathway. Since 10 \u03bcM amiodarone had effects similar to those of 2 \u03bcM amiodarone plus 2 \u03bcM MDEA, typically found in patient sera, in most of the following experiments cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcM amiodarone for 16 h, a time sufficient for the development of the amiodarone-induced phenotype.",

On the opposite, compounds with the lowest activity on SP-A degradation (DIPAM or MOPAM), had the weakest effect on the distribution of LBPA.

The change, clearly discernible in the presence of 2 \u03bcM amiodarone, reached full expression in the presence of 10 \u03bcM amiodarone, giving to cells an appearance similar to that induced by 10 \u03bcM U18666A, a known inducer of the NPC phenotype (Fig. 3) [18]. Besides changing the distribution of unesterified cholesterol, amiodarone also changed cell cholesterol content.

Cells were allowed to internalize BODIPY-LacCer for 45 min to allow loading of late endosomes, followed by 1 h chase to accumulate the fluorescent probe in the Golgi and then were analyzed by confocal microscopy [34]. As shown in Fig. 5\nA, in control cells BODIPY-LacCer accumulated in juxtanuclear structures compatible with the Golgi, while in amiodarone treated cells it accumulated in round structures lacking the staining pattern typical of the Golgi system. Fig. 5A also shows that amiodarone did not perturb the Golgi organization, since it did not change the distribution of the specific marker giantin. Furthermore it appears that the change in BODIPY-LacCer distribution induced by amiodarone (formation of large cytoplasmic aggregates) was different from the distribution as scattered cytoplasmic dots observed in the presence of 10 \u03bcM U18666A (Fig. 5B). Co-localization studies between BODIPY-LacCer and specific Golgi markers were hindered by the fact that BODIPY-LacCer exhibits a concentration dependent shift in its fluorescence emission from green to red wavelengths as a result of excimer formation at high concentrations [36]. From these data we conclude that amiodarone alters the cell distribution of sterols, phospholipids, sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids, generating a phenotype with partial resemblance with Niemann-Pick type C disease [19], [20], [43].",

After uptake, dextrans move through the endocytic pathway ending up into lysosomes, from where they are returned to the extracellular milieu. Wild type fibroblasts in one day may dispose of up to 80% of uptaken dextran [18]. To study the effect of amiodarone on the trafficking of dextran along the endocytic pathway, BHK cells were loaded with tetramethylrhodamine dextran in the absence or in the presence of 10 \u03bcM amiodarone and then were chased for 5 h with plain medium or in the presence of 10 \u03bcM amiodarone, a time sufficient in control cells to move all visible dextran to the lysosomes [35]. As shown in Fig. 7\n, in control cells uptaken dextran had a point-like distribution. On the opposite, cells loaded with TMR-dextran and then chased in the continuous presence of amiodarone, retained a greater fraction of uptaken dextran, which was associated with swollen organelles. At some places these organelles also contained LBPA. From these data we conclude that amiodarone may cause the formation of vacuoles by interfering with the progression of fluid phase endocytosis. Furthermore, the co-localization of LBPA and dextran in swollen organelles suggests that accumulation of water-soluble materials may contribute also to the widening of inclusion bodies.",

On the opposite, as shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9\nand 1SB, in control cells LAMP1 presented as puncta distributed around the nucleus, while after incubation with 2 or 10 \u03bcM amiodarone it concentrated into less numerous but larger structures, as seen for LBPA. Aggregates of LAMP1 induced by amiodarone had different morphology, presenting as clumps or tiny rings (Fig. 8), as spots arranged along the rim of dilated structures (Fig. 1S) or as components of structures surrounded by a rim of tubulin (Fig. 9). Interestingly co-localization between LAMP1 and LBPA, which was moderate in control cells, increased after incubation with 2 \u03bcM amiodarone but was almost nil after incubation with 10 \u03bcM amiodarone, suggesting that low concentrations of the drug might stimulate heterotypic fusion of organelles, while high concentrations could induce homotypic fusion.",

To directly confirm the lack of interference with the ESCRTs, we studied the effect of amiodarone on the formation of lumenal vesicles by isolated early endosomes [54]. To that end the post-nuclear supernatant obtained from BHK cells cultured for 3 h in the presence of 0\u201320 \u03bcM amiodarone, was incubated at 37 \u00b0C with the non permeant fluorescent probe 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid in the presence of an energy donor system and trapping of the probe in the interior of vesicles forming by inward budding of endosome limiting membrane was allowed to take place for 20 min. Subsequently, after quenching the extra-organellar fluorescence with p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide, endosomes were isolated by flotation and the fluorescence associated with them was measured. In 3 separated experiments we found no change in endosome-associated fluorescence after incubation with amiodarone. Thus several lines of evidence indicate that amiodarone has no direct effect on early endosomes. It is possible, however, that chronic exposure to the drug might reverberate on early endosomes also, perhaps by modifying the global trafficking of membranes or through the sequestration of critical lipids.",

Since basic pKa and low membrane permeability, favour the sequestration of weakly basic amines in the lumen of acidic organelles [55], we infer that amiodarone target resides into or is accessible from the lumen of late endosomes/lysosomes. The nature of amiodarone target remains to be clarified since the present results are compatible both with the inhibition of specific component(s) accessible from the luminal side and with an aspecific effect, like the competition of amiodarone with polycationic lipid hydrolases or activator proteins for the negative surface of late endosome/lysosome internal membranes [56]. The last mechanism, recently proposed for other cationic amphiphilic drugs, would explain the accumulation of different classes of undegraded lipids and the membrane traffic jam within late endosomes/lysosomes [57].",

On the other side budding of HIV-1 virus is inhibited in NPC cells or by treatment with U18666A [58], but is not affected by amiodarone. Thus, rather than recapitulating the whole pathogenetic cascade of NPC disease, changes induced by amiodarone might exemplify a common theme observed when damage to late endosomes/lysosomes disturbs pathways intersecting at this crucial spot. As an example, cells lacking prosaposin, a protein cofactor necessary for glycosphingolipid degradation, present enlarged electron-lucent structures of late endosomal origin, accumulate unesterified cholesterol and display altered trafficking of BODIPY-LacCer [59].",

Among conventional antiarrhythmic drugs amiodarone has proved by far the most effective at maintaining sinus rhythm, but effectiveness is diminished by long elimination half-life, iodine-induced thyroid toxicity and acute lung damage. In an attempt to relieve some of these problems, dronedarone, a non-iodinated benzofuran derivative, has been recently introduced in clinical practice [27]. Dronedarone has multichannel blocking properties comparable to those of amiodarone but is more potent at blocking peak sodium currents and acetylcholine activated potassium currents and has stronger antiadrenergic effects [27]. On the basis of the present evidence it appears that, on a molar basis, dronedarone is at least as potent as amiodarone with respect to interference with late compartments of the endocytic pathway. Dronedarone, however, is metabolized rapidly and reaches serum levels over 10 times lower than in patients treated with amiodarone [27], thus the clinical relevance of its interference with late endocytic compartments remains to be determined.",
