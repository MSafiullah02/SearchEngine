The SARS-CoV is a positive-strand RNA virus that encodes two replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b.4 Extensive proteolytic processing of these nonstructural polyproteins is required to provide the functional proteins for viral propagation. These processes are mediated primarily by the main protease (Mpro), which is also known as dimeric chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro).5 The active site of SARS-CoV 3CL protease contains Cys145 and His41 to constitute a catalytic dyad, in which cysteine functions as the common nucleophile in the proteolytic process.5 The 3CL protease cleaves pp1a at no less than 11 conserved sites with a sequence of (Leu, Met, Phe)-Gln \u2193 (Ser, Ala, Gly), in which a P1 glutamine residue invariably occupies the S1 site.5, 6 The 3CL protease is essential for the propagation of the virus, and thus serves as a key target for the discovery of anti-SARS drugs.",

To improve the cell membrane permeability, the P2 phenylalanine residue is replaced by a methylene isostere bearing a 4-fluorophenyl substituent. The previous pharmacophore models,5, 15 by analogy to the structure of TGEV main proteinase, indicated that AG7088 can partially fit into the putative binding pocket of the SARS-CoV 3CL protease, and the moiety of conjugated ester in AG7088 may function as an acceptor of Cys145. Thus, AG7088 is proposed to be a model for the design of inhibitors against the SARS-CoV 3CL protease.",

The SN2 reaction between triflate 10 and the valine-derived malonate 11 was followed by removal of the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group under acidic conditions to provide the desired ketomethylene isostere 12. Catalytic hydrogenation of 12 in the presence of di-tert-butyl carbonate furnished a direct conversion of the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group to the Boc group in 13. Some ketomethylene isosteres are known to be susceptible to epimerization in alkaline conditions.13a In our case, hydrolysis of 13 was realized by using 1.1 equiv of LiOH (0 \u00b0C, 1 h), without complication of epimerization, and the acid product was then treated with allyl iodide in the presence of Cs2CO3 to give the allyl ester 14 as a single product. An oxidative condensation of 2,5-hexadione with aqueous HNO3 gave 5-methyl-3-isoxazolecarboxylic acid,18 and the corresponding acyl chloride 15 reacted with 14, after removal of the Boc group, to give amide 16 in the presence of N-methylmorpholine. The allyl group in 16 was smoothly removed by the catalysis of Pd(PPh3)4, and the resulting acid was coupled with the amine derived from 7 to culminate in the synthesis of AG7088.

We tried assay conditions using a low concentration (5 nM) of the SARS 3CL protease in an extended reaction time (1 h) and showed no sign of slow inhibition due to the irreversible bond formation with compounds 18c\u2013e. The assay with a prolonged period is infeasible due to depletion of the substrate. It is uncertain whether the actual inhibitor binding may be tighter through a slow conformational change. On the other hand, the inhibitor may partially block the process for polyprotein maturation.21 Previous studies suggested that dimeric 3CL protease is the active form.5 Studies using cell-free systems also suggested that the N- and C-terminal tagged forms can be autoproteolyzed, and the autoproteolytic process is susceptible to protease inhibitors.21 Furthermore, 3CL protease can also proteolyze polyproteins in trans for their maturation.21 The cell-free studies therefore suggested the presence of multiple forms of proteolytic activities, and the physical states of the 3CL protease and their reactivity in SARS-infected cells are likely to be even more complicated. Like 3CL protease, the HIV protease is synthesized as part of the polyprotein that is autoproteolyzed for the protease maturation. It is thought that the dimerization of the HIV protease takes place while the enzyme is still in the form of a polyprotein that is synthesized and migrated to the membrane budding sites. Both the location and the timing of the autoproteolysis are crucial for the HIV viral infectivity.25, 26 Very little is known on the physical state and the enzyme reactivity of the 3CL protease in SARS-infected cells. It is thus impossible to surmise, at this time, the rate-limiting target of the protease inhibitors on SARS infectivity. More studies are needed to understand the regulation, proteolytic activity, and physical states of the enzyme present in the SARS-infected cells for the control of SARS virus using protease inhibitors.",

Although AG7088 and the analogs bearing P1 lactam-glutamine residue (1a\u2013d and 2a\u2013d) show no inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV 3CL protease, the related conjugated esters 3a\u2013d and 4a\u2013d are found to exhibit improved activities. The Phe-Phe dipeptide inhibitors 18a\u2013e are designed on the basis of computer modeling of the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complex. The most potent inhibitor 18c, with an inhibition constant of 0.52 \u03bcM, is obtained by condensation of the Phe-Phe dipeptide \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester with 4-(dimethylamino)cinnamic acid. The cell-based assays indicate that 18c is a nontoxic anti-SARS agent with an EC50 value of 0.18 \u03bcM. In addition to valinomycin with an EC50 of 0.85 \u03bcM,7 to our knowledge compounds 18c\u2013e represent the most potent anti-SARS agents known to date. Our computational study of structure\u2013activity relationships shows that hydrogen bonding with the main chain Glu166 and the side chain Gln189 are crucial to the inhibitory potency. This interaction is supported by a modeling complex of SARS-CoV 3CL protease with the inhibitor 18c. We are currently investigating the cocrystal structure, which can give an insight into the proposed complexation mode for further design of new anti-SARS compounds.",

The structures of inhibitory compounds were built in CAChe (Fujitsu, Japan) and refined by performing an optimized geometry calculation in Mechanics using augmented MM2 parameters and stored in PDB format. MGLTOOLS (MGL, Scripps Institute) was used for structure preparation and parameter creation to meet the input requirements of Autodock. Briefly, essential hydrogen atoms were added to the structure model of 3CLpro followed by assigning Kollman united atom charges and solvation parameters. Compound molecules were assigned Gasteiger\u2013Marsili charges,28 merge nonpolar H atoms, and defined torsions. Autogrid tool in Autodock 3.0.5 was applied to compute energy grids (60 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 70 in xyz directions with 0.375 \u00c5 spacing) of various types of compound atoms. These grip maps were centered at the active site. During docking experiments, each compound was kept flexible (except for their rings and amide bonds) and the protein was rigid. Solis and Wets\u2019 local search method with LGA was applied to generate available conformations of compound structures within the active site. The conformational search was conducted utilizing 0.2 \u00c5 quaternion and 2\u00b0 torsion steps. For each compound structure, 5 \u00d7 106 energy was evaluated and 80 poses were selected from 5 \u00d7 105 generations per run. Plausible docking modes were elected by collecting binding free energies, clustering all simulated poses structures within 2.0 \u00c5 root mean square deviations, and selecting the most abundant cluster with highest affinity energy. The conserved hydrogen bond interactions with Glu166 and Gln189, which observed in crystal complex, were considered as the additional factors when electing the binding mode.
