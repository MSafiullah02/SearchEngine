The importance of personal hygiene, the use of protective equipment and the investigation, isolation and treatment of infected patients are well documented elsewhere (https:// www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/eprr/coronavirus/), and are not discussed here.",

Spread from symptomatic as well as asymptomatic patients leads to clusters of local outbreaks, and as community transmission increases, the current policy of contact tracing and containment will move to one designed to slow disease transmission. Without natural immunity in the population, isolation and quarantine will slow, rather than significantly reduce, the ultimate spread of disease. The proportion of the population likely to contract the virus during the outbreak is currently unknown. The UK Government's COVID-19 action plan is preparing for up to 80% of the population to become infected (https://www.gov. uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan).",

The disease has preponderance instead for adults, and especially the elderly and co-morbid. Patients aged >80 years are over-represented amongst diagnosed cases of the disease (3\u00c12% of those diagnosed, despite making up 1\u00c18% of the affected population) 2 It is unclear whether these age discrepancies reflect differences in infection rates, or whether they are due to detection bias, as older patients may be more likely to have symptoms and present for medical attention. The case fatality rate in the elderly is clearly increased however, being 14\u00c18% in those aged >80 years, and 8% between 70 and 80 years. Given the immunosuppressive nature of most cancer therapies, it is expected that patients with cancer will be at higher risk of severe infection than the normal population. Data from China show that patients with cancer have a statistically higher incidence of severe events (including intensive care unit admission/ventilation/death) after contracting the virus (39% vs. 8% in patients without cancer 4 ). However, this was a small series of elderly patients and there are no data available yet on patients with haematological malignancies.",

Furthermore, it is possible that as an epidemic worsens, healthcare provision will be critically stretched, and therefore all activities that place further burden on those resources will have to be justified.
