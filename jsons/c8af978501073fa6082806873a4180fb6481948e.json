Avoid the use of viral transport media to avoid potential inhibition of PCR. Fresh tissues should be stored at -72 C immediately to preserve the nucleic acids \u2022 Paraffin-embedded tissue is acceptable. Usually 5-10 sections (5 mm thickness) are sufficient for PCR analysis.

HIV1 and HIV2 are genetically different; HIV2 shares 40% nucleotide homology with HIV1. HIV2 is more related to SIV than to HIV1. Both types appear to cause clinically indistinguishable AIDS. However, it seems that HIV2 is less easily transmitted, and the period between initial infection and illness is longer in the case of HIV2. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV1, and generally, when people refer to HIV without specifying the type of virus, they will be referring to HIV1. The relatively uncommon HIV2 is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere \u2022 Structure of HIV virion ( Fig. 25.1) -HIV virus consists of a spherical viral particle encased in a lipid bilayer derived from host cell covered by protruding peg-like structures composed of gp41 and gp120 glycoproteins -The virus core nucleocapsid contains the major capsid protein, p24; two copies of genomic RNA; and three viral enzymes (protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase) \u2022 Viral replication ( Fig. 25 .2) -The first step of infection is entry into the host cell, which requires binding of the gp120 molecule on the virus to CD4 molecules on the host cell's surface, and is mediated by the gp41 molecule. Two surface molecules CCR5 and CXCR4, chemokine receptors for beta-chemokines and alpha-chemokines are also required for entry -Once bound, the viral envelope fuses with the cell membrane and the virus' RNA and enzymes enter the cytoplasm -Reverse transcriptase catalyzes, first, the synthesis of a DNA copy of the viral RNA and, second, the synthesis of a second DNA strand complementary to the first one. Therefore, a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is generated -Integrase then facilitates the integration of viral DNA into the cellular chromosome when the cell divides and provides latency enabling the virus to effectively evade host responses -Transcription of the DNA results in the production of RNA.

The group M of HIV1 infection has been classified into nine different genetic subtypes A-K. More than 90% of HIV1 infections belong to HIV1 group M. Subtype/class B is the most prevalent in the developed world \u2022 HIV is transmitted via sexual contact, blood (via transfusion, blood products, or contaminated needles), or passage from mother to child (in utero, during birth, or ingestion of breast milk).

The disease has a steady natural history, starting with an asymptomatic state and progressing toward AIDS. Natural history includes three phases -Early-stage HIV infection is defined as the presence of HIV with a CD4 count greater than 500. Early stage develops 3-6 weeks after initial exposure with self-limited flulike symptoms resolving 2-4 weeks later in 50-60% of patients by high level of viral production, viremia, and widespread seeding of lymphoid tissues -Chronic phase HIV infection occurs when the CD4 count is between 200 and 500. Chronic phase is associated with a period of latency in which the immune system is intact, but there is continuous HIV replication that may last for years. Patients are either asymptomatic or develop persistent lymphadenopathy with minor opportunistic infections, such as candidiasis or herpes zoster -When the CD4 count drops below 200, the HIV infection has entered the crisis phase. This is when certain infections that are easily handled by an intact immune system take advantage of this immunocompromised state (opportunistic infections). Certain cancers may also appear for the same reason.

Quantitation of CD4 cells was the first effective predictor of HIV progression. The CD4 count is one of many factors (including clinical status, HIV viral load, and medication adherence) that should be assessed before starting or changing antiretroviral (ARV) treatment \u2022 The CD4 cell count (<200 cells/mm 3 ) is important in determining the staging of HIV disease and for indicating the need for prophylaxis against opportunistic pathogens \u2022 Most laboratories report the CD4 count as part of a list of several types of lymphocytes, as both an absolute count and a relative percentage. Measurement and trending of CD4 percentage in addition to absolute count must be performed prior to initiation or adjustment of ARV treatment management decisions \u2022 The CD4 percentage sometimes is used in coordination with the absolute value to assess the significance of changes in the absolute CD4 count. The absolute CD4 count can fluctuate as overall lymphocyte counts vary, but the CD4 percentage often remains stable during insignificant CD4 fluctuations. CD8 cell (or cytotoxic T cell) counts do not appear to predict clinical outcomes \u2022 For monitoring purposes, the CD4 count should be repeated approximately every 3-4 months both in stable untreated patients and in patients on stable ART. The CD4 count should be checked more frequently according to the clinical situation -Viral culture \u2022 Although very specific, single positive culture must be confirmed with a second specimen \u2022 Rarely used due to high cost, laborintensive, and less sensitivity than antibody testing \u2022 Negative culture may be caused by technical problems, a defective virus, or the inability of the virus to replicate in culture -Serological studies \u2022 p24 antigen -Early developed assay to detect HIV infection and screen donated blood for HIV -Advantage is to detect HIV infection prior to development of antibodies -Disadvantage is limited utility due to the short window of time and should only be used when other tests are unavailable Whole blood should be stored at 2-25 C for no longer than 6 h.

When a person is infected with HIV, it takes a few weeks for the body to make antibodies to the virus. Most people develop antibodies within a month of infection, although some people can take up to 3 months. In very rare cases, it can take 6 months of the test to be positive. In general, repeat testing for HIV should occur at 3 months if there is a significant concern of recent HIV infection. Additionally, because the level of virus in blood is high during the window period, people can more easily transmit HIV -Serologic HIV antibody screening testing is highly sensitive (ELISA, rapid test, or home test), but requires followup of preliminary positive specimens with a highly specific HIV antibody confirmatory assay (Western blot) ( Fig. 25 .3) -ELISA method is most common and earliest developed antibody screening assay -Home Access HIV1 test system analyzes a dried-blood spot from finger stick collected on filter paper at home and sent to a testing facility -Rapid tests for HIV are assays that detect antibodies to HIV within minutes.

The species that infects humans is commonly known as human CMV (HCMV) or human herpesvirus (HHV) 5. It is the largest of the HHVs characterized by 240 kb doublestranded linear DNA virus (Fig. 25.18) with 162 hexagonal protein capsomeres surrounded by three distinct layers: a matrix or tegument, a capsid, and an outer envelope \u2022 CMV can reside latent in the salivary gland cells, endothelium, macrophages, and lymphocytes. CMV infection is asymptomatic \u2022 The virus acts by blocking cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway and causing massive cell enlargement, which is the source of the virus name \u2022 Clinically symptomatic patients are infants and immunocompromised adults. For infants, the mode of transmission is from the mother via the placenta, during delivery or during breast-feeding \u2022 For adults, CMV transmission occurs from close contact with individuals excreting virus in saliva, urine, and other bodily fluids. Transmission of CMV has been reported from blood transfusion and organ transplant \u2022 By the age of 30, approximately 40% of individuals are infected by CMV; by the age of 60, 80-100% of the population has been exposed to the virus \u2022 Human CMV is difficult to culture as it slowly grows only in human fibroblasts since CMV is very specific in term of species and cell type to be infected Fig. 25.18 CMV genome. MIEP major IE promoter, U L unique long region, U S unique short region, TR terminal repeat sequence, IR inverted repeat sequence \u2022 CMV is transmitted by direct person-to-person contact with a person excreting the virus in their saliva, urine, or other body fluids; contact with infectious body fluids (e.g., urine on a diaper); or contact with fomites (e.g., a child's toy that has infectious virus on it). CMV can be sexually transmitted and can also be transmitted via transplanted organs and blood transfusions. Infectious CMV may be shed in the bodily fluids of any previously infected person, and thus may be found in urine, saliva, blood, tears, semen, and breast milk. The shedding of virus may take place intermittently, without any detectable signs \u2022 The incidence of primary CMV infection in pregnant women in the US varies from 1% to 3%. Healthy pregnant women are not at special risk for disease from CMV infection. When infected with CMV, most people have no symptoms and very few have a disease resembling mononucleosis. But can be severe and life-threatening in immunocompromised patients including organ recipients and AIDS patients. It is their developing unborn babies that may be at risk for congenital CMV disease and occurs in about 1% of all newborns. 10-20% of these infants will develop complications before school age. CMV remains the most important cause of congenital viral infection in the US \u2022 In infants and young children, typical features of the infection include hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary cutaneous erythropoiesis and thrombocytopenia, and petechial hemorrhages. Encephalitis often leads to severe mental and motor retardation \u2022 For immunocompromised patients, CMV disease is an aggressive condition. CMV hepatitis can cause fulminant liver failure. CMV infection can also cause CMV retinitis and CMV colitis -organ disease. Conventional CMV culture involves isolation of the virus in fibroblast tissue culture where it produces a distinctive cytopathogenic effect that is easily confirmed by fluorescent antibody stains -Presence of the virus (positive cultures) can often be determined in as little as 1-2 days, but cultures that are negative for the virus must be held for 3 weeks to confirm the absence of CMV because the virus may be present in very low numbers in the original sample and/or the CMV strain may be slow-growing -CMV culture can be performed on blood, tissue, urine, saliva, or respiratory swabs.

There are two types of CMV antibodies that are produced in response to a CMV infection, IgM and IgG, and one or both may be detected in the blood -IgM antibodies are the first to be produced by the body in response to a CMV infection. CMV IgM antibodies are detected within a week or two after primary infection and lasts 3-4 months. After several months, the level of CMV IgM antibody usually falls below detectable levels -It is not detectable in recurrent infection except in immunocompromised patients where it is detectable in about a third of the cases -CMV IgG antibody is produced early in primary infection and provides protection from primary infections. Levels of IgG rise during the active infection then stabilize as the CMV infection resolves and the virus becomes inactive. After a person has been exposed to CMV, he or she will have some measurable amount of CMV IgG antibody in their blood for the rest of their life -CMV IgG avidity test to distinguish primary CMV infection from past or recurrent infection (reactivation or reinfection). CMV IgG avidity is low (<30%) in primary infection -Prenatal diagnosis of congenital CMV infection is performed only in the case of primary maternal infection as transplacental transmission of CMV is higher in 40% of primary maternal CMV infection. Whereas it is low in the case of recurrent infection 1-4% -CMV IgG antibody testing can be used, along with IgM testing, to help confirm the presence of a recent or previous CMV infection \u2022 CMV antigenemia test -This test is based upon the detection of pp65, a structural protein expressed on the surface of infected polymorph nuclear lymphocytes -The specimen must be processed within 6-8 h of collection, but results can be available within 8-24 h -The number of infected leukocytes present had been reported to correlate with the severity of infection -This test is usually applied to blood CMV DNA tests can be qualitative or quantitative.

Historically, 1-5% of all respiratory infections have been caused by adenovirus. The prevalence of adenovirus respiratory infection in children has ranged from 2% to 14%. Adenovirus also causes 5-15% of acute diarrheal infections in children25.12.3 Diagnostic Methods\u2022 Collected samples are layered on a monolayer of cells in test tubes. If present, adenovirus will present as cytopathic effect of rounded cells \u2022 The best cell line for testing adenovirus is A549. This is a human carcinoma continuous cell line \u2022 When samples are collected within 1-3 days of clinical onset, cell culture generally is positive within 4-7 days. Samples collected after 3 days may take 1-3 weeks to produce cytopathic effect \u2022 Slow growth -not ideal for acute identification: The viral culture can confirm an adenovirus diagnosis, but it may not provide timely results for immediate patient care -Shell vial culture \u2022 Shell vial is another cell culture test but the results are ready in 3 days \u2022 Vials of A549 cells are inoculated with collected samples and centrifuged. The vials are then incubated and stained at day three with immunofluorescent antibodies specific to adenovirus \u2022 The cells infected with adenovirus will light up with examination under a fluorescent microscope\u2022 It is recommended that the shell vial testing is for diagnosing ocular adenovirus infection -Serologic studies \u2022 Seroreactivity to adenovirus is common; measuring adenovirus-specific IgM or rising level of IgG antibody can be helpful. Positive adenovirus titers occur in 50% of individuals >4 years old \u2022 Serology is less useful in the acute clinical setting \u2022 For a serologic diagnosis, serum should be obtained as early as possible in the clinical course, followed by a second titer 2-4 weeks later. A 4-fold rise in acute titers to convalescent titers is diagnostic \u2022 Serological assays have been used over the years to measure adenovirus-specific IgM or rising levels of IgG antibody; however, serology is no longer for diagnosis because it is slow and less specific than antigen or DNA detection -Immunofluorescence \u2022 DFA or indirect IFA may be used for direct examination of tissue. It uses a mouse antibody against an adenovirus group-specific hexon antigen Fig. 25.28 Transcription of the adenovirus genome. The early transcripts are outlined in green, the late in blue.

The xTAG RVP is the only FDA-approved test and has a reported sensitivity of 78.3% and a specificity of 100% \u2022 Pitfalls -Development of PCR-based assays must always consider antigenic drift and random mutations due to viral evolution that may result in false negatives -Important to note that PCR assays are not standardized and variations in sample handling and laboratory methods can affect the sensitivity of the assay 25.12.4 Clinical Utility \u2022 PCR assays provide a rapid and specific diagnosis of adenovirus to allow for early therapeutic intervention and prophylactic treatment in high-risk patients, i.e., geriatric care facility and immunocompromised patients \u2022 Detection of high viral load in blood and monitoring of viral load during treatment can correlate with disseminated adenovirus disease in immunosuppressed patients. Adenovirus is increasingly important in solid organ and bone marrow transplant patients; infections in pediatric transplant cases can exceed 22% with mortality rates as high as 60% 25.13 Respiratory Syncytial Virus 25.13.1 General Characteristics\u2022 RSV is a negative sense, enveloped RNA virus. The virion is variable in shape and size (120-300 nm), is unstable in the environment (surviving only a few hours on environmental surfaces), and is readily inactivated with soap and water and disinfectants \u2022 RSV is a member of the paramyxovirus family that produces a characteristic fusion of human cells (syncytial effect) in tissue culture \u2022 RSV is a medium-sized, enveloped virus with an antisense single-stranded RNA genome \u2022 RSV has two heterotypic strains of viruses that are antigenically distinct, and are classified as subgroups A and B \u2022 The major difference between these subgroups is the antigenic properties of the G surface glycoprotein \u2022 Transmission is from aerosolized respiratory droplets via close contact with infected persons or contact with contaminated surfaces \u2022 Most prevalent in infants aged 2-6 months, but children of any age with underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease or who are immunocompromised are at risk for serious complications from RSV infection25.13.2 Clinical Presentation\u2022 RSV infections typically occur in temperate climates during late fall through early spring and account for 5-15% of community-acquired pneumonias. 50% of children 1year are infected and 100% are infected by 3 years. Immunity wanes with age. Disease may reoccur in patients >65 years \u2022 Two subtypes have been identified. Subtype A involves a severe clinical presentation and predominates in most outbreaks. Subtype B predominates in most asymptomatic strains of the virus that the majority of the population experiences \u2022 RSV bronchiolitis presents with a 2-3-day \"prodromal\" phase, which resembles a common viral upper respiratory tract infection. Additional symptoms include rhinorrhea, wheezing, coughing, low-grade fever, and pneumonia. Circumoral and nail bed cyanosis may occur in severely affected infants \u2022 In the majority of patients with RSV bronchiolitis, symptoms resolve within 5-7 days25.13.3 Diagnostic Methods\u2022 Specimens -respiratory swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage \u2022 Conventional tests and problems -Viral culture \u2022 RSV has a high liability and any specimens should be transported to the laboratory promptly and inoculated into cell cultures \u2022 Nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasal washes, or tracheal secretions are generally the best specimens for isolation \u2022 Specimens should not be subjected to major temperature changes such as freezing and thawing \u2022 Human heteroploid cells, such as HEP2 and HeLa, generally provide the best tissue culture for the isolation of RSV \u2022 RSV produces a characteristic CPE consisting of syncytia formation and appears in 4-5 days \u2022 Decreased sensitivity in adults from reduced viral shedding during acute infections as compared to adolescents -Rapid antigen detection \u2022 Direct and indirect immunofluorescence (IF) methods -Ability to perform direct screening with low cost -Both direct and indirect IF utilizing either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are available which possess a high degree of sensitivity and specificity -The general sensitivity of IF is 80-90% and for monoclonal antibody 95-100%. The specificity is at least 94% -IF techniques are fast and easy to perform, but the interpretation of results is subjective and the specimen must contain adequate nasopharyngeal cells -Incorrect and indeterminate results may occur for specimens with few epithelial cells or when nonspecific antibody reagents are used \u2022 ELISA (BD Directigen\u2122 RSV) -ELISA assays do not require expensive laboratory equipment, take only 15-20 min, and are inexpensive compared to cell culture -ELISA techniques offer the advantages of objective interpretation, speed, and the possibility of screening a large number of specimens. Disadvantages include a generally poorer sensitivity and a \"gray zone\" of equivocal results, which requires confirmation by a time-consuming blocking ELISA procedure \u2022 Serology -Acute and convalescent phase sera are required for the serologic diagnosis of RSV -A fourfold increase in antibody titer or the appearance of specific IgM antibody is required for serologic confirmation of infection -It includes complement fixation (CF) antibody titers, ELISA, neutralization to specific A and B subtypes, and indirect IF -It is unlikely to be of help in the management of the patient because of the length of time required. Furthermore, the serological response in young infants may be poor and not detectable by some antibody assays -Seroconversion does not occur for at Real-time PCR-based assay utilizing NASBA technology containing internal control and specific molecular beacon mix targeting fusion protein of RSV\u2022 Limit of detection is 22 input copies of RSV \u2022 Improved time to result, <4 h -Cepheid SmartCycler \u00ae System -RSV (ASR) \u2022 The RSV Type A or B Primer ASR contains primers designed to detect RSV type A or B \u2022 The RSV Type A or B Probe ASR contains FAM-labeled probes designed to detect RSV type A or B -xTAG \u00ae Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) (Luminex) \u2022 The RVP is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex test intended for the simultaneous detection and identification of multiple respiratory virus nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections \u2022 The xTAG RVP has been designed to simultaneously probe for 12 viral targets in a single patient specimen: influenza A, influenza A subtype H1, influenza A subtype H3, influenza B, RSV subtype A, RSV subtype B, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2, and parainfluenza 3, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. All viruses are probed for in a single multiplex reaction \u2022 xTAG RVP incorporates multiplex Reverse RT-PCR and multiplex targetspecific primer extension (TSPE) with Luminex Molecular Diagnostic proprietary Universal Tag sorting system on the Luminex xMAP platform. xTAG RVP is compatible with both the Luminex 100/200 IS systems \u2022 Sensitivity and specificity -Improved sensitivity and specificity when compared to conventional tests, particularly in the adult population -No cross-reactivity was shown for PIV13; influenza A and B; measles; adenovirus types 1 and 5; hMPV A1, A2, B1, and B2 indicating that the assay is specific for RSV \u2022 Pitfalls -Although the RSV virus can be cultured from an infected individual, the delay in definitive diagnosis of 3-5 days decreases the clinical utility 25.13.4 Clinical Utility \u2022 Ease of assay, rapid turnaround time, and improved sensitivity have enhanced clinical utility in early detection of respiratory illness 25.14 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 25.14.1 General Characteristics \u2022 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently identified respiratory illness that first infected individuals in parts of Asia, North America, and Europe in late 2002 and early 2003 \u2022 The SARS-associated coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, a family of large, enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. It is the first example of a coronavirus causing serious disease in humans \u2022 The SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome is 29,272 nucleotides in length with 41% being G/C residues \u2022 SARS is spread mainly through contact with infected saliva or droplets from coughing. Vertical transmission from mother to infant does not appear to occur 25.14.2 Clinical Presentation \u2022 The SARS virus produces an atypical pneumonia that often leads to respiratory failure, with pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation similar to that seen with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) \u2022 During the early phase of the disease, fever greater than 38 C (100.4 F) is the hallmark symptom. This finding is often associated by myalgia, rigors, and other flu-like symptoms \u2022 During the second week, patients develop a dry, nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and lung infiltrates with rapid progression to respiratory distress \u2022 The cause of death is respiratory failure, with the best predictor of mortality being old age. The fatality of SARS is less than 1% for people aged 24 or younger, 6% for those 25-44, 15% for those 45-64, and more than 50% for those over 65 \u2022 Except for ventilation, no effective treatment is currently available 25.14.3 Diagnostic Methods \u2022 Specimens -Respiratory sample: nasal wash, nasopharyngeal swab, BAL, bronchial wash, or sputum -Transport: 1 ml (minimum volume 0.5ml for adults and pediatrics) respiratory sample in viral transport media (Microtest M4) or in sterile leakproof container at 2-8 C -Unacceptable conditions: Dry swabs are not acceptable. Respiratory aspirates collected in containers with tubing as samples tend to leak, compromising the specimen \u2022 Conventional tests and problems -Viral culture \u2022 Requires BSL3 facility \u2022 Difficulty in culturing the virus from infected individual late in the outbreak during late stages of illness due to possible genetic drift of virus -Serologic studies \u2022 Utility of serologic testing is poor due to late seroconversion of infected patients, i.e., 2-4 weeks \u2022 Antigen detection with monoclonal antibodies or monospecific polyclonal antibody against the N protein was found to be a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of SARS \u2022 For antibody testing, the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test is more commonly performed than the neutralizing antibody test since the former involves minimal manipulation of infectious virus and therefore carries less risk of a biohazard. The test is generally not useful during the first week of illness \u2022 Molecular methods -RT-PCR \u2022 Multiple RT-PCR assays have been developed to detect SARS RNA in clinical specimens utilizing nested, nonnested, one-step or two-step conventional, or real-time RT-PCR assays \u2022 Most nucleic acid amplification tests are designed with the Orf1b or nucleoprotein gene. The latter gene has the theoretical advantage of being more abundant in infected cells and therefore of higher sensitivity, but this has not been clearly proven in clinical studies \u2022 LightCycler SARS-CoV quantitation kit [Roche Diagnostics Corporation] for use with the LightCycler instrument -Ready to use which amplifies a 180-bp target sequence of the replicase 1AB/ polymerase gene of SARS CoV -The analytical sensitivity for the SARS-CoV test is about 20 copies/ PCR reaction \u2022 RealArt HPA-coronavirus RT-PCR kits [artus] for use with the LightCycler instrument, the ABI PRISM 7000, 7700, and 7900H instruments -Amplifies an 80-bp region of the SARS-CoV genome \u2022 EraGen Biosciences MultiCode-RTx (research only) -EraGen's platform increases size of the genetic \"alphabet\" from the two DNA base pairs to six pairs with the development of eight new synthetic bases -It is a new multiplexed real-time PCR platform -Only standard PCR primers need to be designed.

Therefore, a positive result in stool alone may not correlate with current disease 25.15.4 Clinical Utility \u2022 Enteroviral meningitis is common in the US and leads to a large number of hospitalizations per year due to an inability to distinguish from bacterial meningitis. Therefore, enterovirus differentiation from bacterial illness can significantly reduce hospitalizations, antimicrobial use, and diagnostic testing \u2022 Rarely, dual infections (enteroviral and bacterial) can occur. Therefore, a positive enterovirus result with clinical features incompatible with benign viral meningitis should not lead to discontinuation of antibiotics 25.16 JC/BK Virus 25.16.1 General Characteristics \u2022 The BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV) are small, nonenveloped, closed circular, doublestranded DNA virus and belong to human polyomaviruses, members of the Papovaviridae family \u2022 They were first isolated in 1971 and named", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF27": {"text": "25.17 HHV6 25.17.1 General Characteristics \u2022 HHV6: two variants (A and B) -Type B is most common as primary infections in US, Japan, and Europe -Type A is most common among asymptomatic children in Africa \u2022 Nearly 100% of population infected by 3 years of age \u2022 Virus becomes latent or persistent until reactivated (immunocompromised hosts).

However, plasma can be used to distinguish between the two (as latent individuals do not have plasma positive viral DNA) \u2022 Viral loads can be separated into very Contamination is an issue, given that the techniques use signal amplification 25.18 Clinical Utility \u2022 HHV6 can be especially dangerous in immunocompromised hosts \u2022 HHV6 is present in a very large percentage of the population (100% of individuals greater than 3 years of age) \u2022 Testing is required to determine if the host has a primary or latent infection \u2022 Standard testing (viral capture or serology) is too time-consuming \u2022 Quantitative PCR and RT-PCR can especially be useful", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
