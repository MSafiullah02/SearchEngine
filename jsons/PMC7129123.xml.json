            "text": "Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of end-stage liver disease, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with 170 million of the world's population infected [1, 2]. Spontaneous eradication of the virus is achieved in only 15\u201350% of newly infected individuals, while the rest develop chronic infection [2]. The ability of the virus to persist within a host is attributed to its efficient ability to evade the adaptive and innate components of the host's immune system [3, 4]. Liver-lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing integrin (L- SIGN), also known as dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecular-3-grabbing nonintegrin related (DC-SIGNR or CD209L), is a C-type lectin expressed on endothelial cells in the liver and lymph node sinusoids, and might promote spread of viruses that target liver and lymph nodes [5, 7]. Several studies have demonstrated that L-SIGN binds soluble HCV E2 and mediates trans-infection of liver cells by HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) [8, 12]. Thus it may concentrate HCV in the liver and enable captured virus to cross the endothelial barrier, thereby facilitating infection of adjacent hepatocytes [9, 13]. These findings raise the hypothesis that interaction of HCV with this molecule in liver and lymph nodes may have important consequences for HCV infection [9].",

            "text": "L-SIGN is a type II transmembrane protein composed of three domains: an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a neck region made up of a highly polymorphic domain, and a C-terminal extracellular C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) involved in pathogen binding [5]. The neck region is responsible for the homo-oligomerization that brings the CRDs into proximity for high-affinity ligand binding [14]. The L-SIGN gene, located on chromosome 19p13, is highly polymorphic in the neck region based on the number of repeats in exon 4. There are between three and nine repeats (3- to 9- alleles) of a 69-base-pair segment [5, 15, 16]. Each repeat encodes a hydrophobic motif characterized by a-helical coiled coils [14, 15]. Disease association studies have shown that polymorphism of the L-SIGN repeat region is associated with protection against SARS coronavirus infection [17] and also HIV infection [18, 19]. The high expression levels of L-SIGN on hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells suggests it may be involved in the capture and concentration of HCV in the liver and hence the establishment of persistent infection [8, 20]. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that length variation in the L-SIGN neck region could influence the establishment of HCV infection [20]. To our knowledge, the association between L-SIGN neck region length polymorphism and spontaneous clearance of HCV has not been explored. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that this variant may be associated with persistent/spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in a Moroccan population that has been well characterized in terms of the natural outcome of HCV infection.",

Blood samples from chronic hepatitis C patients and individuals with spontaneous clearance were collected at the Medical Center of Biology at the Pasteur Institute of Morocco and Service of Medicine B CHU Ibn Rochd Hospital, Casablanca, from November 2010 to September 2012. One hundred and fifty patients had persistent HCV infection (90 women, 60 men), among them 40 patients with cirrhosis according to fibrosis stage. All subjects were persistently positive for anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibodies and HCV ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) over a period of more than 6 months. Sixty-three individuals had spontaneously resolved HCV infection (45 women, 18 men). All were positive for HCV-specific antibodies and negative for serum HCV RNA by qRT-PCR from at least two measurements more than 6 months apart. To obtain information on the frequency of alleles in the Moroccan population, a set of 109 unrelated anti-HCV and HBsAg-negative healthy subjects (56 women, 53 men) of mixed Berberic and Arabic ethnicity, with normal serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were recruited from the Pasteur Institute of Morocco.

            "text": "L-SIGN is a calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding protein, specialized in the recognition of carbohydrate structures present on cellular and viral proteins and implicated in several processes such as cell adhesion and antigen presentation [15, 24]. L-SIGN has been shown to act as a receptor with high-affinity-binding to hepatitis C virus glycoprotein E2 and may facilitate transmission into adjacent hepatocytes [8, 12]. The neck region of the L-SIGN region plays a crucial role in the tetramerization of the receptor and the support of CRDs, thus influencing the pathogen-binding properties of these receptors. The neck region of L-SIGN repeats is highly variable and varies with ethnic groups [25]. Therefore, we first examined the frequency of this polymorphism in a Moroccan population characterized by mixed Berberic and Arabic ethnicity as determined by their geographical location between the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Sahara desert. The frequency of heterozygosity for L-SIGN alleles was similar in our Moroccan population (52.3%) to that reported in East Asian populations (52%), Caucasian European populations (61.5%) and Middle-Eastern populations (60.8%) [25], and the frequency of heterozygotes was higher than that reported in Chinese (45%) [17] and Japanese (37.4%) populations [26]. Allelic distribution of repeats in Moroccan individuals was mostly represented by the wild-type 7-repeat form (56.4%), followed by the 6- (20.2%), 5- (18.3%) and 4- alleles (5%). This distribution is closer to that reported in Caucasian populations [5, 25, 27]. The diversity of L-SIGN polymorphisms is due to balancing selection in non-African populations [25]. However, a recent study showed that demographic migration of different tribes might also explain L-SIGN diversity [28].",

This result was further confirmed in additional studies [19, 29]. Moreover, a study on SARS patients showed that individuals homozygous for L-SIGN neck-region repeats were less susceptible to SARS-CoV infection (OR = 0.649; p 0.005) [17]. However, these correlations were not found in studies on HIV [30, 32] or studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections [33]. The discrepancy between these studies may be related to ethnic differences between the different studies. A study, however, explored the possible association between L-SIGN neck-region variation and HCV infection using HCV-infected patients and healthy controls. Although they did not find a difference between these two groups within the HCV population, they found that individuals with the 4 and 9 alleles had lower viral loads, which agrees well with our results [34].",

            "text": "Our study explores, for the first time, the role of L-SIGN neck-region variation in the clearance of HCV infection, particularly the 7/4 genotype and 4- allele. The length variation of this neck region had been proposed to affect the pathogen-binding properties of the CRD of these proteins [15, 24]. Moreover, in vitro studies show that cells with the L-SIGN-7 allele have higher levels of capture and trans-infection decreased with progressive deletions of the tandem repeats [20]. In addition, it has been reported that the number of tandem repeats also influences binding affinity for HIV-1 gp120 [35]. Recently, it has been shown that loss of neck repeats in this variant reduces the extension of the CRDs from the membrane surface, a feature that could reduce access to pathogens [23]. These data indicate that L-SIGN isforms thereby serve to modulate the outcome of HCV infection and disease progression by influencing viral entry [20]. Interestingly, our work suggests that variations in the number of L-SIGN repeats were linked with HCV viraemia. Patients with 5-, 6- and 7-repeat alleles had higher HCV-RNA loads than patients with the 4-repeat allele. This finding is consistent with a previous report [34] highlighting the concept of trans-infection and capture of the HCV virus to infect adjacent hepatocyte cells and HCV replication efficacy were influenced by the L-SIGN neck-region length. Furthermore, we found that variations in L-SIGN genotypes/alleles were not associated with ALT and AST levels, suggesting that this polymorphism was not involved in hepatic inflammation and also there was no association with viral genotype and treatment response. Indeed, this result was confirmed when we analysed the L-SIGN isoforms with the progression of disease to cirrhosis. These preliminary data indicate that L-SIGN neck region length polymorphism has no affect on liver damage.",
