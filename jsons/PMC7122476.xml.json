            "text": "As such, the concept of gene delivery to the lung for therapeutic as well as preventive purposes appears to be straight forward: relatively easy application meeting with patient compliance, direct accessibility of the target tissue, low enzymatic activity (compared to the oral route of application) and absence of pH gradient. However, as with all \u201csimple\u201d concepts, the devil is in the details. In this case, as somebody put it correctly in the three challenges afflicting all efforts in drug development: Delivery, Delivery, and Delivery. The first delivery aspect is to deposit an aerosol DNA bearing particles at the correct site in the lung, maintaining DNA integrity in lieu of shear forces necessary to produce aerosol droplet sizes suitable for inhalation. The second is to enable the uptake of DNA carrier systems by, if possible, the \u201ccorrect\u201d target cells. The last aspect is related to obtaining successful transfection, i.e., the successful expression and processing of the protein encoded in the DNA delivered. For all three of these stages, technologies have been developed over several decades. In this chapter, we would like to focus on supplying the reader with an overview over some aspects of \u2013 nonviral \u2013 DNA delivery for both gene therapy and DNA vaccination in the lung.",

Using DOTMA (N-[1-(2,3)-dioleyl-oxy)propyl]-N,N,N-triethylammonium), in combination with the fusigenic lipid DOPE (dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine) to form complexes with a pDNA encoding for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), successful transfection of pulmonary tissues in mice was achieved in the absence of toxic side effects. In this case, the aerosolization was achieved by nebulization in what turned out to be a rather inefficient process. Application of aerosol had to be maintained for a total duration of 4\u20135 h, aerosolizing 6 mg of total DNA, of which only about 10 \u03bcg was finally deposited in the lung. However, this study sparked the interest in aerosol delivery of pDNA for a number of genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF) [2, 50], lung cancer [27], and inflammatory afflictions of the lung, such as asthma [2].",

Especially seen the forces necessary to produce droplet sizes suitable for inhalation (about 2 \u03bcm), shear stress occurring during nebulization is to be minimized in order to maintain structural integrity of the DNA delivered [15]. A recent paper by Lentz et al. [41] investigated the effect of the strain rate on the integrity of plasmid DNA (pDNA) aerosolized from different delivery systems (ultrasonic, vibrating mesh and jet nebulizer, electrostatic spray). The strain rate \u03b3 is defined as the derivative of velocity (du) in correlation to linear distance traveled (dy) [56]:\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\gamma =\\text{d}u/\\text{d}y.$$\n\\end{document}\n",

In spite of a relatively low strain rate, also vibrating mesh nebulizers exerted a destabilizing effect on plasmid DNA, possibly due to the interaction of the molecule with the vibrating grid [41]. As was already shown, DNA degradation in ultrasonic nebulizers was due to cavitation, i.e., the collapse of air bubbles creating shock waves, which can damage the DNA [42]. In contrast to aerosolized \u201cnaked\u201d DNA, complexation with positively charged molecular entities, condensing and compacting DNA, has been shown to lead to a stabilization of the DNA delivered, besides resulting in a potential increase in transfection efficiency observed [57].",

PEI has therefore been considered as a nonviral delivery system in gene therapy of CF [20], a genetic disease caused by the aberration of a chloride channel protein, the CFTR protein, expressed in mucosal epithelia in the intestinal tract and the lung [46]. As the cause of fatality is linked to the pulmonary effects of CF, gene therapy through application of the correcting gene by aerosolization was attempted early on. In this regard, PEI was shown to protect DNA against degradation during the aerosolization process [17], to lead to a higher transfection rates compared to most cationic lipids [16], with transfection using PEI polyplexes not inhibited by lung surfactant [19]. However, PEI is significantly cytotoxic, which appears to depend on the density of the positive charges as well as on the molecular weight of the polymer [33], and the degree of molecular branching [70]. Cytotoxicity of PEI and aggregation tendency of PEI/DNA complexes could greatly be reduced by grafting PEI with PEG, with reduction in cytotoxicity being dependent on the degree of PEG grafting, and not on the molecular weight of PEG [52, 55].",

For the formation of stable polyplexes, the number of amine groups available appears to be of crucial importance. Polyplexes formed with PLL below a molecular weight of 3 kDa were shown to be unstable [38]. On the other hand, polyplexes prepared with high molecular weight PLL tended to form aggregates in isotonic solutions [43] and exerted considerable cytotoxicity [14]. To overcome these challenges, PLL was grafted with PEG, resulting in an A\u2013B-type block copolymer [71]. Polyplexes formed with these copolymers maintained their stability in serum, and can be applied in suspensions at a concentration exceeding 12 mg/ml DNA in isotonic saline [44]. Successively, PEG-PLL polymers were employed in preclinical studies in mice, transfecting 60\u201375% of epithelial cells lining the bronchial tract after a single intratracheal application [75]. Based on these favorable data, a first clinical trial was initiated [35], testing the application of a plasmid expressing for the CFTR protein and condensed with PEGylated PLL (CK30) in a total of 12 CF patients in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation intranasal study. Primary endpoints \u2013 safety and tolerability \u2013 were met, and the secondary endpoint \u2013 gene transfer efficiency \u2013 was assessed as well. A partial to complete response was seen in eight subjects, and correction persisted for 6 days, for 1 patient even up to 4 weeks after single nasal application of the polyplex formulation.",

It is industrially produced by alkaline deacetylation of chitin, which is the structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans [61]. The degree of deacetylation of chitosan ranges from 40 to 98%. Different molecular weights (range of >100,000 to <2,000 Da) and viscosity grades are on the market. The primary amino function affords the possibility of easily altering the chemical modification of chitosan. The pK\na value of this amino group was determined to be around 6.5 and does not vary significantly, even for different degrees of N-acetylation. Hence, chitosan is positively charged and soluble in acidic solutions, whereas unmodified chitosan is insoluble at physiological pH values (7.2\u20137.4). Chitosan has been considered to serve as a vector for gene delivery [60] due to biocompatibility and biodegradability [5]. A study dedicated to unravel the relationship between the structure of chitosan, i.e., its molecular weight and degree of deacetylation, its toxicity in vitro, and transfection efficiency after intratracheal administration in mice was performed recently [34]. It was shown that the percentage of deacetylation must be greater than 65% to achieve stable complexes with plasmid DNA, and achieve transgene expression. In terms of acute toxicity, measured by incubation with 293 cells, an IC50 value of 630 mg/ml was measured for ultrapure chitosan (UPC) of a deacetylation degree of 83%, in comparison to an IC50 value of just 75 \u03bcg/ml for PEI of a molecular weight of 800 kDa [24]. After intratracheal instillation, polyplexes were mostly found in the airways of the central lung. PEI transfection was seen to be more effective and longer lasting than with UPC, which itself was comparable to cationic lipids. It was considered to be safe for pulmonary application, provided chitosan is used in its ultrapure form [31].",

Hereby, airborne bacterial and viral infections in the lung tract (e.g., influenza, measles, and tuberculosis) are major reason for high rate of deaths per annum [74]. In fighting against such lung infections, pulmonary delivery of vaccines mimics the natural way of infection and might therefore be an appropriate way for their prevention. In animal models, aerosol delivery involves intratracheal instillation and insufflation or the use of exposure chambers, whereas for clinical trials a delivery device is required. Microsized particles (1\u20135-\u03bcm in size) are generated by dry-powder inhalers and aerosols from liquid-suspended particles by nebulizers, which are then delivered into the respiratory tract [47]. In history, aerosol vaccination was applied in human subjects for more than a century and includes aerosol vaccines against anthrax, plaque, tularemia, smallpox, tetanus, and botulism [23]. When compared to common parenteral immunizations, the following benefits of aerosolized vaccines are matter of discussions:\nDelivery of vaccines into the respiratory tract can trigger the secretion of local IgA antibodies, which are in turn capable of crossing epithelia and preventing further entrance of pathogens.The particular noninvasive nature of antigen delivery into the lungs circumvents the common use of needles and syringes, which are the main cause for unsafe injections (e.g., needle-stick injuries). According to WHO sources [51], those unsafe injections cause 8.2 million cases hepatitis B, 2.3 million cases of hepatitis C, and 0.1 million cases of HIV/AIDS around the world.The application of pulmonary dry-powder vaccines could stop the common imperative of an intact cold chain for storage, what is mandatory for conventional vaccines.For the administration of vaccines by using inhalers, no specially trained medical personnel will be required.\n",

After 1 month of treatment, aerosol vaccination with the EZ strain caused seroconversion of 326 (84.7%) schoolchildren, which was superior to 257 (78.8%) who received the subcutaneous EZ vaccine or 176 (62.2%) who received subcutaneous Schwarz vaccine. The authors stated that this method of aerosol vaccination might also be suited for mass campaigns in pediatric populations [18].",
