From health concerns to situations related with marketing, informatics or even sociology, several are the fields that are using this epidemiological model as a first approach to better understand a situation. In this paper, the basic transmission model is analyzed, as well as simple tools that allows us to extract a great deal of information about possible solutions. A set of applications -traditional and new ones -is described to show the importance of this model.",

The best fit parameters yield an estimated active infectious period of 1/\u03b3 = 2.2 days and a mean transmission rate \u03b2 = 1.66 per day. Therefore, the estimated R 0 is 3.652. Figure 1 represents the dynamics of the three state variables. It can be observed that the curve of susceptible is decreasing all over the time, because the birth was no considered, and once become infected never returns to the state of susceptible. The curve of infected reaches to a peak of the disease beyond 5 weeks. This information could be very useful for health authorities to ensure that all resources are available -medicines, doctors , hospitalization resources -to provide a good health care if necessary. Depending of flatness of the curve the response should be adaptive. The curve related to the recovered compartment is important because accumulates the number of individuals that have been seek in that outbreak.

Different codes have different ways to spread in the internet. Virus mainly attack the file system and worm uses system vulnerability to search and attack the computer. And for trojan horses, they camouflage themselves and thus induce the users to download them. There are a variety of computer virus, but they all have infectivity, invisibility, latent, destructibility and unpredictability [7] . The word latent means that the virus hide themselves in the computer and spread them in the internet while the users can not notice them. More details about applications to the spread of computer virus can be found in [9, 13, 14, 44] .",

Economic research in this area began in response to the AIDS epidemic and has led to an improved understanding of the thought/decisions towards a infectious disease, by anonymous individuals or policymakers [1] . the power to eradicate an infectious disease is not only in the hands of policymakers or health authorities: it is also important that rational individuals made their own response to lower the prevalence of a disease, by increasing protection. Economic epidemiology has made significant advances in educating health officials about the behavioral implications of public policies. Aadland et al. explored the nature of the short-run equilibrium dynamics for rational expectations economic epidemiological systems. They show that well-intentioned policy has the potential to create instability when people behave rationally and in a self-interested manner.",

Some papers [?, ?] analyze the importance of individual bank-specific factors on financial stability. The spreading of the contagion in the interbank network can be seen as an epidemiological model. The authors investigate the systemic risk and how this risk can propagate in different bank and countries within the euro area. Fisher makes counterfactual simulations to propagate shocks emerging from three sources of systemic risk: interbank, asset price, and sovereign credit risk markets. when the conditions deteriorate, these channels trigger severe direct and indirect losses and cascades of defaults, whilst the dominance of the sovereign credit risk channel amplifies, as the primary source of financial contagion in the banking network.",

[31] hypothesized the effect of a zombie attack and its impact on human civilization. According to their mathematical model, \"a zombie outbreak is likely to lead to the collapse of civilization, unless it is dealt with quickly. While aggressive quarantine may contain the epidemic, or a cure may lead to coexistence of humans and zombies, the most effective way to contain the rise of the undead is to hit hard and hit often.\" The model showed two equilibria: the disease-free equilibrium (with no zombies) and the doomsday equilibrium (where everyone is a zombie). The application of a linear stability analysis showed that -in the absence of further interventions -the disease-free equilibrium was unstable and the doomsday equilibrium was stable. Since this paper, other authors follow this area with a careful attention (see more in [8, 25] ), not only motivated by the tv series, but as a way to motivate young students for the epidemiology issues.",
