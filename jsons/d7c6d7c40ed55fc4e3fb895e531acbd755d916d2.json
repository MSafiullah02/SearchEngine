We found a significant degree of diversity in methodological strategies, inconsistent adherence to existing guidance on the selection of methods, who was involved, and based on the variation we observed in timeframes, form, choice, sequence, combination, function, application and reporting of methods and strategies, there is no apparent gold standard or standardised approach to competency framework development.",

Such variation is a cause for concern, potentially resulting in the development of frameworks that may not have captured the complexities of clinical practice, which are therefore of limited value to the profession, and may unwillingly create and legitimise artificial outcomes. The results of this review suggest there is a need for improved guidance in the process for developing and reporting competency frameworks.",

These competencies are often outlined in competency frameworks and have served additional purposes, including for example to facilitate assessment (Eraut 1994; ten Cate 2005; Winter and Maisch 2005) , to clarify complexity, to facilitate mobility and articulation across jurisdictions (Gonczi et al. 1990; Heywood et al. 1992) , and to analyze and evaluate expertise both within and outside the profession (Baer 1986; Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999) . The CanMEDS framework (J. Frank et al. 2015) , the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Outcomes project (reported by Swing 2007) , and the 'Jurisdictional Collaborative Project' for entry-level registered nurse practice competencies (Black et al. 2008 ) are examples of frameworks that have been used in these ways. Given the stakes that such frameworks hold for educators, learners, regulators, health professions and healthcare broadly, development guidelines have been created (Aylward et al. 2014; Heywood et al. 1992; Marrelli et al. 2005; Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999) . However, the complexity associated with different professional practices may lead some to enact development activities differently. Indeed, similar professions in different jurisdictions have resulted in different outcomes (J. Frank et al. 2015; Swing 2007) , suggesting that different processes may have been used. This emphasis on actual developmental processes, in the context of existing but perhaps outdated guidelines, is the focus of this study. Understanding these activities may provide insights into how these processes shape eventual outcomes and their trustworthiness and provide insights into what may hold value for refinement of existing guidelines.",

            "text": "The development of competency frameworks require strategies to ensure that the complexity associated with professional healthcare practice is captured and represented. This complexity can emerge in a number of ways. For example, regional or contextual variability, unique practice patterns, the role and attributes of individuals and individuals within teams, and other interacting competencies that make practice in multiple contexts possible (Bordage and Harris 2011; Garavan and McGuire 2001; Heywood et al. 1992; Knapp and Supernaw 1977; Lingard 2012; Makulova et al. 2015; Roe 2002) . The nature of clinical practice can also be difficult to define or understand fully (Garavan and McGuire 2001; Mendoza 1994) . The role of tacit knowledge in professional practice, for example, can be difficult to represent -that is, there can be a disconnect between the personal knowledge of professionals which becomes embedded in their practice, and the publicly accessible knowledge base of the profession (Collin 1989; Eraut 1994) . Competence and its component parts are often inconsistently understood or defined and attributed multiple meanings depending on context (Hay-McBer 1996; Spencer and Spencer 1993; ten Cate and Scheele 2007) . Other difficulties may include shifting patient demographics or societal expectations, the role of technology, how professions are to be conceptualized, and changes in organizational structures and work processes (Duong et al. 2017; Jacox 1997; Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999) . As such, any attempt to examine, capture and represent professional practice must contend with these challenges, leaving developers with decisions on what to include or integrate, and how best to make those choices (Garavan and McGuire 2001; Shilton et al. 2001) Given this inherent complexity in attempting to capture and accurately represent the features of a health profession, researchers have suggested that a combination of approaches be employed, while taking into consideration practicality, efficiency, and what might be deemed acceptable to the profession (Heywood et al. 1992; Marrelli et al. 2005; Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999) . For instance, this may include the identification of relationships between competencies in context (Roe 2002) , or the need to examine the existing information on the profession, including developments over time, and other related or adjacent professions (Heywood et al. 1992; Klink and Boon 2002) . Methods may require an analysis of both the functions of the profession and the attributes of individuals that enable professional work to be carried out competently (Heywood et al. 1992) . Those who will be affected by the framework (e.g., providers, stakeholders), may also provide value in its development, and ensure the final framework is relevant to all those who will be affected by it (Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999) .",

While there is no guidance on what specific methods to use, the sequence of methods or even how many strategies or sources to include, there is consensus that in order to increase the validity and utility of competency frameworks a variety of approaches may be necessary, akin to a process of triangulation (Heywood et al. 1992; Klink and Boon 2002; Kwan et al. 2016; Marrelli et al. 2005) . For example, in attempting to promote validity and utility, development of the CanMEDS framework and its subsequent revisions involved empirical research, wide consultation, determination of societal need, professional expertise, and educational principles (J. Frank et al. 2015) . However, feasibility, the level, depth, and complexity of practice and access to appropriate stakeholders may lead competency developers to prioritise and/or simplify the developmental and validation process (Marrelli et al. 2005; Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999) .",

This in turn may inaccurately represent the profession, or represent it in unintended ways, and inappropriately impact dependent systems (e.g. policy and standards) with significant effects downstream on curriculum, accreditation, assessment, and subsequent professional practice. Given the activity related to the development of competency frameworks in many health professions, little attention has been paid to the approaches and methods used. Exploration of these aspects may yield useful insights into choices made and why, when developing competency frameworks. As such, the primary objective of this study is to understand the way in which health professions develop competency frameworks and then to consider these activities against existing guidance.",

We considered competencies and/or competency frameworks as a combination of KSAOs necessary for comprehensive practice within an occupation, or to function to an expected professional standard (Heywood et al. 1992; Shilton et al. 2001; Verma et al. 2009) or \"the ability to perform the tasks and roles required to the expected standard\" (Eraut and du Boulay 2001) . Other related concepts were also considered. For example, Entrustable professional activities (EPA) serve as a type of competency framework, intended to bridge the gap between education and practice (ten Cate and Scheele 2007; Van Loon et al. 2014) . Search term examples included competency frameworks, EPAs, competency, and standards, using combinations of keywords and subject headings (see Appendix I for full details). Six databases were selected to ensure a broad range of disciplines could be included: MEDLINE via Ovid, CINAHL/EBSCO, PsycINFO via Ovid, EMBASE via Ovid, Scopus, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). The grey literature sites greylit.org and Trove were also searched. Google Scholar was searched and the first 1,000 records were reviewed. Citations within articles were title screened if they appeared relevant to the review (Greenhalgh and Peacock 2005) . The search was restricted to articles published in English. No limits were set on publication date, study design or country of origin. Pilot searches were conducted in May and June 2018 with the help of two information specialists to refine and finalize the search strategy. The final searches were conducted in August 2018, tailored to the specific requirements of each database. Systematic search details are provided in Appendix I.",

Studies varied in the number of approaches used from one (n=18, 9%) to eight (n=2, 1%). The median number used was three, and a total of 140 studies (74%) utilised three or more methods or strategies. Combinations of methods used varied, and no distinct pattern emerged when analysed by profession. Study periods were not outlined in the majority of studies, but of those that did (n=78), the timeframe for the development of competency frameworks ranged from two days to six years, with 41 (53%) completed in 12 months or less. The objectives of the included studies varied from the explicit development of a competency framework or standard, to exploratory studies into the role of the profession or discipline in question, and frameworks were often developed as a component of a larger project such as national standards. Variation in application of approaches While diversity exists in both the combination and number of methods and strategies used in the development of competency frameworks, we also observed variability within these approaches in relation to form, function and application. We observed this in the use of group techniques, literature reviews, the role of stakeholders, in mapping exercises, surveys, interviews and practice analyses. Next we elaborate on these findings, organized from most to least commonly used in developing competency frameworks.

Within these techniques, variations were evident along a number of dimensions including form, function, application and intended outcomes (e.g., to achieve consensus, to facilitate dissemination, to review draft documents etc.). For example, while both Aylward and Davis used working/steering groups, one was used to draft the initial framework (Aylward et al. 2014) , while the other used it to edit a draft created by an expert group (R. Davis et al. 2008 ). Cappiello used a Delphi method to gain agreement on competencies early in the development of the framework, while Sousa used it as a final step to gain consensus on the framework. Focus groups varied in composition of the group, the size and number of groups, and the purpose for which the focus group findings were used. For example, the composition for some comprised of members of the same discipline (Halcomb et al. 2017; Palermo et al. 2016) , while others saw value in using members from different disciplines (Booth and Courtnell 2012; Gillan et al. 2013 ) -in direct contrast to the sine qua non of focus groups (Lederman 1990 ). In terms of how this method was used, some used it in the initial identification and drafting of competencies (Booth and Courtnell 2012; Patterson et al. 2000) , while others used it to engage stakeholders during the development process ( (Tavares et al. 2016; Yates et al. 2007) , and (e) environmental scans (McCallum et al. 2018; National Physiotherapy Advisory Group 2017) . Many authors did not explicitly outline the type of review they conducted, and outlined their review using terms including 'broad', 'extensive', 'specific', and 'comprehensive'. These choices may be fit for purpose; however, we also observed variation in the function and application of these different types of literature reviews. For example, some authors performed a review to identify existing competencies (Chen et al. 2013; Hemalatha and Shakuntala 2018) , while others performed a literature review to inform methodology and methods (Davey 1995; Sherbino et al. 2014 ). In addition, the majority of authors did not share their search strategies or results as part of their study. It appears that authors make decisions regarding the role and relevance of reviews, and integrate them (or not) for a variety of reasons which may include practicality, expertise, time, and purpose.",

The documents used for mapping exercises included (a) specialty board certification exams or reporting milestones (Cicutto et al. 2017; Klein et al. 2014 ), (b) national policies and health service agendas (Glanville Geake and Ryder 2009; Mills and Pritchard 2004) , (c) relevant frameworks from other countries (L. Liu et al. 2014; McCallum et al. 2018) , and (d) international or regional frameworks (Barry 2011; W\u00f6lfel et al. 2016) . Variation within this approach was also apparent, and authors operationalized mapping exercises by several terms that included 'evaluated against', 'based on', 'abide by', 'integrated', 'mapped to', 'inclusive of', and 'according to'. These mapping exercises were used as a foundation for framework development (Boyce et al. 2011; McCallum et al. 2018) , to identify a pool of items to use in consensus methods (M. Liu et al. 2007) , to generate behavioural items for identified competencies (Aylward et al. 2014) and to organise and tabulate responses from stakeholders (Loke and Fung 2014) .

            "text": "One-on-one interviews demonstrated similar variation in form, function, application and outcomes (e.g. to gain expert input, to analyse behaviours, to engage key informants). The form of interviews included (a) semi-structured (Akbar et al. 2005; Daouk-\u00d6yry et al. 2017 ), (b) structured (Amendola 2008), (c) in-depth (Blanchette 2015; Tavares et al. 2016) , (d) group interviews (Loke and Fung 2014) , (e) critical incident McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2009) , and (f) behavioural event interviews (Calhoun et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2013) . Participants in interviews included patients and family members (Dijkman et al. 2017; Patterson et al. 2000) , academics (Chen et al. 2013; Gardner et al. 2006) , and healthcare professionals (Calhoun et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2013) . The function of interviews varied, and they were conducted to gain expert input (Smythe et al. 2014; Tavares et al. 2016) , to gain insight into practice (Dunn et al. 2000; McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2009) , to confirm findings from other methods (i.e. triangulation) (Dunn et al. 2000; Palermo et al. 2017) , and to solicit contributions from diverse stakeholders (Kwan et al. 2016) . Application of this method demonstrated variation, and the number of interviews conducted was often not reported. In contrast to the inconsistent reporting of the focus group method however, most authors provided details on the selection process and the methodology used for interviews in their studies. For example, many authors outlined in detail their sample, recruitment strategy, interview technique, recording, transcription, and analysis of interview data (Palermo et al. 2017; Tavares et al. 2016) Practice analysis Some authors elected to use analysis of practice as a strategy during competency framework development. This involved methods such as (a) functional analysis (Bench et al. 2003; Palermo et al. 2016 ), (b) analysis of administrative data (Dressler et al. 2006; Stucky et al. 2010 ), (c) direct observation of practice (Dewing and Traynor 2005; Underwood et al. 1996) , (d) critical incident technique (CIT) (Dunn et al. 2000; Lewis et al. 2010) , (e) review of position descriptions (Akbar et al. 2005; Fidler 1997) , and (f) task or role analysis (Cattini 1999; Chang et al. 2013) . Again, we identified variations in form, function, and application. For example, Dressler et al. (2006) identified commonly encountered conditions in billing data, while Stucky et al. (2010) and Shaughnessy et al. (2013) identified commonly recorded diagnostic codes to inform the development of competency frameworks. Dunn et al. (2000) , Underwood et al. (1996) , and Dewing and Traynor (2005) observed practice in-person, while Patterson et al. (2000) observed video recorded interactions to develop an understanding of practice. Practice analyses were used to inform the initial list of competencies in frameworks (Dressler et al. 2006; Fidler 1997) , as a means of capturing the complexity of practice in context (Dunn et al. 2000; Underwood et al. 1996) , to triangulate data from other methods McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2009) , and as a means of validating frameworks (Carrington et al. 2011) . Timeframes of data collection also varied significantly, and while not always reported, some methods such as direction observation of practice required hundreds of hours of data collection and coding (Dunn et al. 2000; Underwood et al. 1996) their development. After considering the approaches used from multiple professions and jurisdictions, we found a significant degree of diversity in these methodological strategies used in type, amount and combination (i.e. there is no consistent approach). We found inconsistent adherence to existing (albeit limited) guidance on the selection of methods, who was involved, and based on the variation we observed in timeframes, form, choice, sequence, combination, function, application and reporting of methods and strategies, there is no apparent gold standard or standardised approach. Group techniques and literature reviews were among the most widely used strategies, but even here significant heterogeneity existed within these and other methods. We also observed the use of novel methods when adopting practice analyses. These findings have implications for how we consider future guidance related to the development of competency frameworks.",

            "text": "Given the historical focus on methods in the development of competency frameworks, there is relatively little guidance describing how to identify the most appropriate methods, the recommended sequencing or combination of specific methods, or what might be necessary methods when developing competency frameworks, which may explain some of the variation we observed. While existing guidance suggests a degree of flexibility, allowing developers room in the development process to take into consideration their context (Heywood et al. 1992; Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999) , there is less guidance on when, why or how to make those choices. Thus we recognise that what may be fit for one setting, in terms of methodological approaches, may not be for another (Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999) , but also that without careful consideration and elaboration of those choices, utility and ultimately the validity associated with outcomes becomes less clear, or at least difficult to examine. The heterogeneity in our findings suggests that developmental strategies and outcomes may be influenced by many factors such as intended purpose, available resources, timeframes, and the experience and expertise of developers. We assume that authors are selecting strategies that seem fit for their context, and while such approaches may be functionally aligned, the utility and/or validity associated with choices made remains an area rich for debate. These influencing factors often remain implicit, and authors often neglected to outline why they selected specific approaches. This could be due in part to a lack of guidance, and/or the absence of reporting guidelines. However, this lack of existing guidance may also have led to the emergence of novel strategies. For instance, although only a small number of studies (n=15) described a practice analysis, six different methods were described under this strategy. Thus the objectives of the framework development process appeared to inform what might be considered appropriate methods to analyse practice. Such methods may be practical, and appropriate or acceptable to stakeholders, and are worth further study. It may be necessary to continue to support such flexibility in approaches but perhaps it may also be necessary to obligate (a) an analysis of the functional alignment of those choices with the intended uses of planned competency frameworks, and (b) an analysis of the outcomes before or at least as part of adoption plans.",

            "text": "Because these final products can exert significant influence on education, curriculum, assessment, and accreditation (Heywood et al. 1992; Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999) , the community needs to remain aware of the 'god-term' status afforded to 'competence' or competency frameworks in healthcare (Lingard 2009 ). As a result of this status, and the underlying reasons for their creation, competency frameworks are assumed to be legitimate, accurate representations of practice. Clinical practice requires competencies that many current reductionist competency frameworks are unable to identify (Bradley et al. 2015) , and it takes place within the context of broader social systems that remain implicit in many studies. Combined with the challenges we have outlined regarding underlying assumptions, feasibility of methods, complexity of practice and access to stakeholders, this means that the delivery of the final product could, perhaps unknowingly, be prioritised over the comprehensiveness of the development process. As a result, developers may artificially legitimise outcomes that are not representative of the profession. This may subsequently result in the creation of what could be termed a 'false-god' framework. A 'false-god' (i.e., idol) is an object of afforded high value that is illegitimate or inaccurate in its professed authority or capability (Toussaint 2009 ). Such a framework may poorly reflect, or even neglect, the complex realities of practice. However, this framework would appear legitimate, and as such would be 'worshipped', in that it is adopted by the profession, potentially leading to inappropriate downstream influence on policy, standards, and/or education.",

We observed variability in the form, choice, sequence, function, application, and reporting of methods and strategies, perhaps as a result of a lack of appropriate guidance.

It is our hope that this review furthers the conversation related to the development of competency frameworks in healthcare professions. The findings offer those involved in the development process the opportunity to consider the complexity of practice that they must strive to capture with their chosen approaches.

Similarly, Kirk and Landzaat used variations of nominal group technique (NGT).Kirk et al. (2014) utilised NGT as traditionally described(Delbecq and Van de Ven 1971), whileLandzaat et al. (2017) utilised a hybrid of modified Delphi and NGT components. Ling was the only study to utilise group priority sort method. Authors includingKlick et al. (2014) used a large conference to facilitate input and dissemination. Conversely, others such asSkirton et al. (2010) elected for a smaller group workshop to review draft documentation and gain input. The variation evident within these group techniques suggests that authors made choices (that were not always explicit) in what they valued as meaningful data sources and strategies when using such techniques. While there is variation within this overall category and the methods within it, the same holds true for other sources of evidence for competency framework development.Literature reviewsDifferent types of literature reviews included (a) systematic reviews(Galbraith et al. 2017;Klick et al. 2014), (b) scoping reviews(AlShammari et al. 2018;Redwood-Campbell et al. 2011), (c) integrative reviews(Camelo 2012), (d) focused reviews",
