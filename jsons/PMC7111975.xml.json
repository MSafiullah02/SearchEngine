            "text": "The novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), previously also known as human coronavirus (HCoV) EMC, was first identified in a patient who died from severe acute pneumonia and renal failure in Bisha, Saudi Arabia, in September 2012 (Chan et al., 2013b, Chan et al., 2012, de Groot et al., 2013, Zaki et al., 2012). Although a zoonotic source has been suspected in bats and camels, the definitive and intermediate animal reservoirs have so far not been confirmed, which may have partly contributed to the continuing spread of the epidemic (Annan et al., 2013, Chan et al., 2013c, Chan et al., 2013, Lau et al., 2013, Reusken et al., 2013, Woo et al., 2007, Woo et al., 2012). As of February 7th, 2014, a total of 182 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection with 79 fatalities have been reported in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa (WHO, 2014). The evolving outbreak has raised global concern of a SARS-like epidemic particularly because of their comparably protean clinical manifestations involving both the respiratory tract and extrapulmonary tissues, and the unusually high crude fatality rate among infected patients (Assiri et al., 2013b, Chan et al., 2012, Guery et al., 2013, Memish et al., 2013). These clinical observations corroborated with several key experimental findings on the high pathogenicity of MERS-CoV. First, MERS-CoV replicated more rapidly and showed a much broader tissue tropism in-vitro than any other coronaviruses associated with human infections including SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2013a). Second, using human lung epithelial cell line as a model, it was shown that MERS-CoV induced a massive dysregulation of the host transcriptome, which may prevent the host from mounting an optimal immune response (Josset et al., 2013). Third, the utilization of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) instead of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63), aminopeptidase N (HCoV-229E), and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (HCoV-OC43) as a functional receptor by MERS-CoV may also account for the differences in the spectrum of organ involvement between MERS and other human coronavirus infections (Du et al., 2013, Raj et al., 2013). Finally, there is currently no specific anti-MERS-CoV treatment proven to be effective in clinical trials, though mycophenolic acid, interferons, ribavirin, cyclosporin A, and an HR2 peptide have demonstrated in-vitro activities (Chan et al., 2013d; de Wilde et al., 2013; Falzarano et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Despite these initial clinical and laboratory correlations, the virulence of MERS-CoV has remained controversial especially after a recent study which reported that most of the patients who required hospitalization or died from MERS were elderlies with comorbidities, specifically diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic renal, heart and lung diseases (Assiri et al., 2013b). In contrast, healthy children and adults might be asymptomatic or develop mild infection detected only during contact tracing (Assiri et al., 2013b, Chan et al., 2013b). Furthermore, many MERS patients developed extrapulmonary manifestations including renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms, coagulopathy, cytopenias, and pericarditis (Assiri et al., 2013a, Chan et al., 2013b). The mechanisms by which these extrapulmonary tissues are involved in MERS are incompletely understood. MERS-CoV RNA was detected in mononuclear cells and stellate cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes of infected rhesus macaques, hinting the possibility of macrophage or dendritic cell involvement (de Wit et al., 2013). More in-depth studies on the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV are urgently needed to ascertain its virulence and pathogenetic mechanisms for more accurate prediction of its clinical behavior and better design of therapeutic options. Given the ability of MERS-CoV to infect different human immune cell lines including monocytes and T lymphocytes, we postulated that it might also be able to infect dendritic cells (DCs), which are potent antigen presenting cells (APCs) with instrumental roles in linking the innate and adaptive immune systems. Although previous literatures suggested that SARS-CoV was unable to establish a productive infection in DCs, we suspected that MERS-CoV might be able to infect DCs in a more efficient manner due to the wide distribution of its cellular receptor DPP4 in human cells including activated leukocytes (Raj et al., 2013).",

As perhaps the most potent APCs, DCs are capable of entering peripheral tissues, taking up antigens, migrating to lymphoid tissues, and activating helper T cells (Banchereau and Steinman, 1998, Steinman and Banchereau, 2007). In this capacity, DCs play unique roles in bridging the innate and the adaptive immunity and therefore become important targets for microbial invasion. For instance, HIV has evolved a number of mechanisms to exploit the function of DCs for its own benefit, including escaping from the immune surveillance and facilitating cell-to-cell dissemination (Wu and KewalRamani, 2006).",

Infection of DCs by SARS-CoV failed to trigger a strong type I interferon (IFN) response but resulted in an up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Law et al., 2005, Tseng et al., 2005). Functional activation of DCs by SARS-CoV has been analyzed but the result was inconclusive as both activation (Spiegel et al., 2006, Tseng et al., 2005) and absence of activation (Ziegler et al., 2005) have been proposed. In the current study, we used monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs) as a system to recapitulate MERS-CoV infection in DCs and we compared the results with that of SARS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs. Our results revealed fundamental differences in the replication kinetics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in infected Mo-DCs. In addition, we also demonstrated characteristic changes in the pattern of cytokine/chemokine expression as well as antigen-presenting function of infected Mo-DCs.",

The signal for NP appeared to be puncta-like and distributed in the cytoplasm of infected cells. At 48 hpi, the signal for NP was dramatically enhanced and was detected throughout the cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1B). Mock-infected cells (Fig. 1C) as well as cells treated with pre-immune sera (data not shown) both failed to display any signal for NP. Our immunostaining study revealed that Mo-DCs were susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. The enhanced expression of NP at 48 hpi versus 12 hpi suggested that MERS-CoV not only infected Mo-DCs but also continued viral transcription and translation in these infected cells. In addition, the percent of Mo-DCs infected by MERS-CoV was assessed by flow cytometry and was determined to be 12.6%\u00b11.2% at 48 hpi (data not shown).",

To obtain a more comprehensive picture of the kinetics of MERS-CoV infection in Mo-DCs, we infected Mo-DCs with MERS-CoV and compared the results with that of SARS-CoV-infected cells. Importantly, a 2-to-4 log increase in viral RNA in both cell lysates (\nFig. 2A) and supernatants (Fig. 2B) of MERS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs was detected in samples from all donors. In stark contrast, little or no increase in viral RNA was detected in the cell lysates or supernatants of SARS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs, which agreed with previous reports that SARS-CoV could infect but was unable to propagate in Mo-DCs. We further assessed the infectivity of viral particles released from infected Mo-DCs with TCID50 assays. Our results demonstrated that while low levels of infectious particles were detected from the supernatants of SARS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs, MERS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs consistently released a considerable amount of infectious particles with a peak at 24 hpi (Fig. 2C).

At the same time, while MERS-CoV similarly failed to trigger the expression of IFN-\u03b2, it induced an up-regulation of IFN-\u03b1 at the early time points. As shown in\nFig. 3A, SARS-CoV marginally up-regulated the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and did not induce an up-regulation of IL-12. On the other hand, MERS-CoV induced significantly higher expression levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 than SARS-CoV. Pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were similarly up-regulated in MERS-CoV-and SARS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs.

However, there was a marked reduction in viral genome copy over time and a notable absence of infectious progeny from the inoculated cells, which indicated that the infection, if any, was at low level (Spiegel et al., 2006) or was abortive (Law et al., 2005, Tseng et al., 2005). The absence of SARS-CoV NP expression in Mo-DCs suggested that the viral replication cycle was incomplete (Ziegler et al., 2005). In our current study, we demonstrated conclusively that MERS-CoV could productively infect Mo-DCs. First, the immunofluorescence study showed a progressive increase in NP signal in infected Mo-DCs over time (Fig. 1). Second, the positive-strand viral genome of MERS-CoV increased by 2-to-4 logs in the supernatants and cell lysates of infected Mo-DCs (Fig. 2A and B). Third, TCID50 assays performed using supernatants from MERS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs demonstrated that MERS-CoV produced a substantial amount of infectious virus particles with a peak production time at around 24 hpi (Fig. 2C). Clinically, patients who contracted MERS-CoV developed coagulopathy, multi-organ dysfunction and hematological changes including lymphopenia, neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia. The virus could be detected not only in the respiratory tract, but also in the blood (Guery et al., 2013), urine (Drosten et al., 2013), and stool (Drosten et al., 2013) of infected individuals, which strongly argued for a systemic dissemination of the virus. In this regard, MERS-CoV-infected DCs and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) (Zhou et al., 2013) could potentially serve as vehicles of dissemination and facilitate the spread of the virus to the lymph nodes, where they interact with T cells, and further worsen the cytokine/chemokine storm, mimicking the scenario in SARS (Gu et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Currently, the exact reason of why MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV could productively infect DCs is unclear. Differential infection outcome with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may be partially attributed to the difference in the level of receptor expression. ACE2 (Li et al., 2003) and DPP4 (Raj et al., 2013) are the functional receptors of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans, respectively. Previous reports have suggested that ACE2 is not expressed in monocytes or DCs (Law et al., 2005). A separate group suggested that ACE2 could be detected by Western Blots in MDMs and DCs but surface expression of ACE2 could not be detected by flow cytometry (Tseng et al., 2005). Our own analysis by RT-qPCR showed that while Mo-DCs express high level of DPP4, the expression level of ACE2 is marginal and is close to the detection limit (unpublished data). In addition, SARS-CoV uses DC-SIGN and L-SIGN as alternative receptors (Han et al., 2007, Jeffers et al., 2004). DCs are known to express abundant levels of C-type lectins, which facilitates their antigen-uptake (Figdor et al., 2002). For instance, DCs internalize and sequester HIV particles through DC-SIGN, which is exploited by HIV to facilitate efficient cell-to-cell trans-infection (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000). A similar mechanism is also utilized by hepatitis C virus in trans-infection of liver cells (Cormier et al., 2004). Therefore, it is possible that while MERS-CoV infects DCs with virus production, SARS-CoV is primarily sequestered by DCs. Further investigation on this possibility will be necessary.",

            "text": "DCs are important stimulators of T cells and B cells for specific immune responses. In addition, upon encountering pathogens, DCs are capable of releasing a large number of cytokines and chemokines. Infection of Mo-DCs by SARS-CoV did not induce up-regulation of anti-viral interferons, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, but resulted in the up-regulation of other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Law et al., 2005, Tseng et al., 2005). Recent research demonstrated that MERS-CoV failed to trigger anti-viral interferon or pro-inflammatory innate immune response in primary human airway epithelial cells and in cultured cells (Chan et al., 2013, Zielecki et al., 2013). In the current study, we reported that MERS-CoV induced no IFN-\u03b2 and marginal IFN-\u03b1 expression in infected Mo-DCs. MERS-CoV induced comparable levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 compared to SARS-CoV. In parallel, the expression level of chemokine IL-8, MCP-1, and MIP-1\u03b1 was subtle and was not significantly different between MERS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs. Most importantly, MERS-CoV triggered a significantly higher expression level of IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, IP-10, and RANTES, compared to SARS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs (Fig. 3). In SARS-CoV-infected patients, viral replication was limited to the first two weeks after symptom onset, without continued widespread replication after this period (Nicholls et al., 2006). On the other hand, a number of cytokines and chemokines including but not limited to IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, and IP-10 were found to be highly up-regulated in SARS-CoV-infected patients even after viral clearance (Huang et al., 2005, Jiang et al., 2005, Wong et al., 2004). The resulting immune dysregulation including an IFN-\u03b3 mediated cytokine storm might have accounted for a large proportion of SARS-associated mortality (Huang et al., 2005). In the current study, we showed that MERS-CoV induced significantly higher expression level of IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, IP-10, and RANTES in infected Mo-DCs, compared to SARS-CoV. While IP-10 and RANTES both recruit T cells, IL-12 mediates the differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 cells and stimulates the production of IFN-\u03b3 from T cells, representing a positive feedback loop. Our data raised the possibility of an IFN-\u03b3-induced, Th1 cell-mediated immunity and hyperactive inflammatory response in MERS-CoV-infected patients causing severe diseases before host adaptive immune response could be mounted.",

            "text": "In the capacity of professional antigen-presenting cells, DCs capture and process both endogenous and exogenous antigens and present the processed antigens through MHC class I or MHC class II molecules. During DC maturation, antigen capturing, processing, and presentation are accompanied with an increase in the surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules, including CD40, CD80, and CD86, which are critical for T cell signaling and activation. Previous studies performed using SARS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs indicated that while the expression of MHC class I was comparable in infected and mock-infected cells, the expression of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80 and CD86) were up-regulated (Spiegel et al., 2006, Tseng et al., 2005), although conflicting results existed (Ziegler et al., 2005). In this study we demonstrated that MERS-CoV induced higher surface expression of MHC class II (HLA-DR), and co-stimulatory molecule CD86 than SARS-CoV in infected Mo-DCs (Fig. 4). Although only around 13% of Mo-DCs were infected by MERS-CoV, it appeared that CD86 and HLA-DR were up-regulated in a much larger proportion of cells, which could be a result of paracrine signaling from the infected Mo-DCs to the un-infected cells since the expressions of a number of key cytokines and chemokines were up-regulated in MERS-CoV-infected Mo-DCs. As a result of the up-regulated MHC class II (HLA-DR) and co-stimulation molecule CD86, the robust activation of T cells may contribute to an exaggerated T cell function, which may lead to more destruction of infected pulmonary tissues when adaptive immune response is mounted later in the course of illness. Alternatively, activated T cells also produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines that may potentially aggravate the cytokine cascade.",
