As early as 1980, a general survey identified cases of fluorosis in more than 7100 villages, distributed over 1000 counties in China. It is estimated that there are currently over 21 million patients with dental fluorosis and over 10 million patients with skeletal fluorosis in China (DDCMH, China). The cause of these conditions is in most cases excessive uptake of fluorine via drinking water. Low but regular uptake of fluorine is beneficial for dental health, but when present concentrations are above 1 mg/L in drinking water, it can lead to dental fluorosis, and at concentrations beyond 3 mg/L, the incidence of dental fluorosis will reach 100% for exposed individuals. The World Health Organization (WHO) advises a maximum allowable fluorine concentration of 1.5 mg/L in drinking water (Fawell 2006).",

An imbalance of vitamins A and D, and Ca and P uptake can increase the dental damage associated with fluorine (Li 2004). Drinking water guidelines set by the Chinese government require the fluorine concentration in municipal drinking water to remain within the range of 0.5\u20131.0 mg/L. In recent years, efforts have been made to mitigate adverse effects of endemic fluorosis in high-fluorine areas, through improving water quality and, when needed, by relocating communities through the project of eco-migration conducted by the government; from the 1980s to the end of 2016, the ecological migration project in Ningxia, led by the local government, has relocated more than 1 million people from the contiguous poverty-stricken areas of the Liupanshan Mountains to the areas along the Yellow River. The Ningxia ecological migration project is a process of population spatial reconstruction under the response of ecological pressure in the ecologically fragile area and the extremely poor area of Liupanshan Mountains.",

            "text": "Owing to the relatively high prevalence of endemic fluorosis in China, the fluorine distribution, origin, and other factors responsible for the disease have frequently been investigated. Liu and colleagues demonstrated in 1980 that endemic fluorosis was mainly concentrated in 3 regions within China: an east-to-west belt in the northern deserts, a region along the northern coast, and a region in the south, with a number of localized smaller areas elsewhere. Groundwater with a high fluorine content was correlating with geological conditions, soil lithology, and hydrochemical characteristics in Northern China (Liu et al. 1980), while in Inner Mongolia it was mainly detected in the alluvial-pluvial plain at the mountain front (Feng et al. 2015), suggesting an origin from fluorine-containing minerals and rocks in the surrounding mountains. A correlation with soils and groundwater rich in sodium carbonate was identified (He et al. 2010). Low Ca2+ concentrations further favor the formation of high-fluorine groundwater, as is a slight alkalinity (Mao et al. 2016). This was demonstrated in the plain and mountain front of Inner Mongolia, where pH and concentrations of HCO3\u2212, \u03b418O, \u03b4D, and total dissolved solids (TDS) were all higher in high-fluorine groundwater collected in the plain than those in the mountain front (Li et al. 2018). Similar findings were reported from inland river basins in Yanchi, Ningxia (Wu et al. 2018). Piper trilinear diagrams were used to indicate the groundwater facies are basically identical in different seasons, and hydrochemical facies are of the Na-Cl type and Na-SO4-Cl type, while Gibbs diagrams illustrated that groundwaters reside in evaporation-dominant areas, highlighting the crucial role of evaporation in the chemistry of groundwater (Wu et al. 2018).",

However, the correlation of river water high in fluorine is less well investigated, while the collective influence of river water, groundwater, and rainfall in China remains to be assessed. This is particularly important in the high-fluorine region in northwestern China, where a loess plateau is rich in carbonate with an alkaline pH (Liu et al. 1966), and fluorine-bearing minerals such as mica, amphiboles, tourmaline, and apatite are abundant. Through rainfall, groundwater leaching, circulation, and exchange between groundwater and surface water, fluorine can be released from these minerals to be introduced into surface water including river water.",

The highest values for both waters were obtained in April during the dry season, and the lowest in July during the wet season (Fig. 5). Values obtained in November were within these extremes. This reveals the significant role of surface runoff in regulating fluorine concentration in the surface water. During both the dry and wet seasons, the average fluorine concentration of main stream water was lower than that of tributary water, implying that the tributary water contributed significantly to the fluorine content of the main stream water. The higher concentration of fluorine in tributary water during the dry and wet periods was most likely caused by the confluence of groundwater containing high concentrations of fluorine. In November (normal season), the average fluorine concentration of main stream water was higher than that of tributary, implying that the import of tributary into main stream waters no longer exerted an additive effect on fluorine concentration. During the dry season, rivers are mainly replenished with groundwater, which in this case is rich in fluorine due to leaching from fluoride-bearing rocks. During the wet season, the rivers are mainly replenished via rainfall, thereby diluting the overall fluoride concentration. Nevertheless, the tributary waters produced higher concentrations, most likely because the main river was fed by upstream alluvial sources low in fluorine. During the normal season, the latter effect seemed to be weaker, resulting in higher fluorine concentrations in the main river.",

Robertson investigated the distribution, migration, and enrichment of fluorine in groundwater in alluvial-pluvial basins of Arizona, USA (Robertson 1984), which revealed that the fluorine in groundwater largely originated from ion exchange and fluorine-bearing mineral dissolution. Lahermo described that the fluorine distribution in groundwater in Finland and East Africa was associated with the distribution of fluorite, granite, gneiss, and crystalline granite (Lahermo et al. 1991). Indeed, the dissolution of fluorine-bearing minerals is commonly regarded as the source of fluorine in groundwater (McCaffrey and Willis 1993). This dissolved fluorine is then transported to enter groundwater in processes dictated by geological structural units such as strata of fault zones (Apambire et al. 1997). External factors, such as hydrochemical facies, geomorphology, and microtopography, and human activities all contribute to groundwater reaching high concentrations of fluorine (Conrad et al. 1999; Kundu 2001; Levy and Schramke 1999). Carrillo-Rivera et al. explored the distribution of high-fluorine groundwater in the San Luis Potosi basin, Mexico, and demonstrated that there high-fluorine groundwater was dependent on hydrogeological conditions, temperature, and fluoride concentration in the vadose zone (Carrillo-Rivera et al. 2002). Rukah et al. conducted a geochemical assessment on fluoride contamination of groundwater in North Jordan (Rukah and Alsokhny 2004), who reported a positive correlation with pH and bicarbonate concentration. Alvarez et al. clarified the source of fluorine through analyzing the relation between aquifer sediments and ionized water in Patagonia, Argentina (Del Pilar Alvarez and Carol 2019). The similar contour and the spatial distribution of fluoride in the phreatic aquifer were reported in Toketo, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, which was mainly controlled by groundwater flow. There, a high-fluorine area (> 5 mg/L in groundwater) was located in a discharge area which was shallowly buried and strongly exposed to evaporation (Feng et al. 2016). In addition, the relation between groundwater and phreatic aquifer is also similar to that in Nagar Parkar area, Sindh, Pakistan, i.e., the concentration of fluorine in the upstream is much higher than that in midstream/downstream (Rafique 2009).",

From the data analyzed here, we conclude that fluorine in the Qingshui River basin dominantly originates from chemical weathering of fluorine-bearing minerals. This leaching contaminates groundwater that feeds into surface waters, where evaporation leads to higher concentrations and rainfall to diluted concentrations. Thus, the overall concentrations are associated with geological features of these arid and semi-arid areas as well as the basin structure, hydrochemical facies of the groundwater, and local climate conditions. Due to less precipitation than evaporation, surface waters are being enriched in fluoride. High concentrations of fluorine in the Qingshui River are the results of water\u2013rock interaction and evaporation. The latter increases TDS and fluoride concentrations; intensified ionic strength as a result of Qingshui River further enhances the solubility of fluoride.",

The data collected since the 1980s identified multiple regions with a high incidence of endemic fluorosis, especially in south-central Ningxia. Fluorosis cases concentrate in two villages located in the upstream region of the Qingshui River within the Yuanzhou District and in Xiji County along one of its tributary arms. The fluorosis incidence decreases further downstream of the Qingshui River. The spatial distribution of villages and population of endemic fluorosis present the following features: headwater > river valley basin; mainstream > tributary; upstream > midstream > downstream.

The national disease control system is the most important backbone in the prevention and control of this acute infectious disease. Similarly, in the prevention and control of endemic diseases, the CDC system also plays an extremely important role. The prevention and control of endemic fluorosis by the Ningxia disease control center and local government has been implemented since the beginning of the 1950s. The problem of endemic fluorosis in the south-central region of Ningxia has been solved through universal salt iodization, medical treatment, and other measures. After the 1980s, through the general survey of endemic diseases and dynamic monitoring of endemic diseases control departments at all levels, a comprehensive investigation and study on endemic fluorosis in Ningxia was carried out. On this basis, local disease control departments try to change the situation of high incidence of endemic fluorosis in South-Central region of Ningxia through a series of comprehensive engineering projects. The local government has relocated about 1 million people of south-central region of Ningxia by ecological migration project to the plain and high platform area along Yellow River, the Yellow River water as the main drinking water source, which greatly reduced the incidence rate of endemic fluorosis. At the same time, the local government of Ningxia diverted the Yellow River water to Tongxin County, Haiyuan County, Hongsibu District, Yuanzhou District, and other places in the south-central region of Ningxia through the water diversion project, which changed the habit of drinking shallow groundwater and Qingshui River water in these areas, and solved the drinking water problem of most of the population in the areas with a high incidence of endemic fluorosis. From 2000 to 2017, the total number of endemic villages was showing a downward trend, especially the more serious endemic fluorosis such as skeletal fluorosis and the number of people were gradually decreasing. However, due to the relatively scattered administrative villages in the south-central region of Ningxia, there are still some villages taking shallow groundwater as drinking water. The local governments need to build large and medium-sized reservoirs as the primary drinking water source to further solve the drinking water problems of these villages, so as to completely eliminate endemic fluorosis in the region.",

Based on the historical 40 years data on endemic fluorosis and the spatial distribution and formation mechanism of high concentrations of fluoride in Qingshui River basin in Ningxia, this study concludes that there is a close coupling relationship in south-central Ningxia between the endemic areas of endemic fluorosis and the spatial and temporal distribution of excess fluorine water of Qingshui River basin. This relationship indicates that fluoride in the groundwater of the Qingshui River basin has long been affected by geological structures, low-lying and closed terrain, and drought. Qingshui River and shallow groundwater in the basin have a strong process of mutual resupply and transformation. And we consider the phreatic aquifer of the basin as the prominent contributor for endemic fluorosis because shallow groundwater is the main source of drinking water for a long time in this region. The temporal and spatial distribution of regional endemic fluorosis with long time series and its corresponding relation with water fluoride content in watershed were discussed. Then, we preliminarily concluded that the upper part of the basin is the high-incidence areas, and the middle and lower reaches are the middle and lower levels. The spatial distribution of villages and population of endemic fluorosis presents following features: headwater > river valley basin; mainstream > tributary; upstream > midstream > downstream. These distribution features are basically in agreement with the contour of fluoride in the groundwater and the spatial distribution of fluorine concentration in the phreatic aquifer in Qingshui River basin. This conclusion confirmed the source, settlement, and the change process of fluoride concentration in precipitation catchment in different seasons, and its influence on the endemic fluorosis areas. The results are of great significance in scientific research. However, the monitoring time series of the basin is relatively short in the research process, and there is still insufficient correspondence with the historical data of the disease, so further follow-up research is necessary. At the same time, this study is also of great practical significance for local governments to control endemic fluorosis. We believe that the Ningxia government should continue to carry out water improvement measures through the water diversion project of the Yellow River, so as to govern the endemic fluorosis in the Qingshui River basin from the source. Furthermore, implement \u201ctargeted poverty alleviation\u201d and ecological migration poverty alleviation projects, and move the poor people in the uninhabitable endemic fluorosis areas to the Yellow River\u2013irrigated oasis areas such as the plain and the high platform, with the Yellow River water as the main drinking water source, so as to thoroughly solve the situation of high incidence of endemic fluorosis in the areas.",
