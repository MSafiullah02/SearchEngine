In the face of the Covid-19 epidemic, this measure contributed to a reduction in the reproductive rate in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea.",

In order that the lifting of the confinement can be as early and as risky as possible, the National Academy of Medicine stresses the importance that this lifting of the confinement be accompanied by the maintenance of the barrier measures currently recommended until the circulation of the virus is controlled, as attested by the absence of new cases declared for a period of 14 days. As part of this lifting of containment, the mandatory wearing of a ''general public'' or ''alternative'' mask by the population should be maintained; \u2022 in France, it has not been customary to build up a small stock of anti-projection masks in each household. As the shortage of masks is likely to last a few more weeks, a ''general public'' or ''alternative'' mask must be used for the time being and in order to escape the containment. ",
