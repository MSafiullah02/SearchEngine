Since its detection in humans at the end of 2019, it has rapidly spread worldwide causing respiratory infections of various degrees of severity. The most common symptoms, which develop within 2\u201314 days of exposure, are dry cough, fever and fatigue[1, 2]. Mild infections may be self-limiting in few days, but in some cases the respiratory symptoms can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a high risk of death from multiorgan failure.",

Only one patient denied cough and fever. None of them had a history of abdominal surgery or a notable medical history, including inflammatory bowel disease. They reported no melena or weight loss.

Physical examinations were normal with no distended abdomens, tenderness or hypo/hyperactive bowel sounds. The vital signs were in the normal range with a maximum body temperature of 39\u00b0C (37.6\u00b11\u00b0C).
