Between 1300 and 1800 malaria cases are reported each year in the UK, although reviews of reporting suggest that this may represent about 65% of all cases that occur.1 Approximately three-quarters of reported infections are due to Plasmodium falciparum and there are between 2 and 11 deaths annually. Children under 16 account for around 10% of cases.2 Two thirds of cases occur in people of African or South Asian ethnic origin and over half of the cases occur in those who had been visiting friends and family in endemic areas.3 Most patients with falciparum malaria acquire infection in Africa and malaria accounts for about 20% of travellers from Africa presenting to hospital with fever; West Africa is the commonest geographical source. Most Plasmodium vivax infections are acquired in South Asia.2, 4\n",

Malaria should be suspected in anyone with a fever or a history of fever who has returned from or previously visited a malaria endemic area, regardless of whether they have taken prophylaxis. The minimum incubation period for naturally acquired infection is six days. Most patients with falciparum infection present in the first month or months after exposure; almost all present within six months of exposure. Vivax or ovale infections commonly present later than six months after exposure and presentation may be delayed for years. There are no specific symptoms of malaria: most patients complain of fever, headache and general malaise.10 Gastrointestinal disturbances, jaundice or respiratory symptoms occasionally occur and are often responsible for misdiagnosis. Most missed malaria infections are erroneously diagnosed as non-specific viral infections, influenza, gastroenteritis or hepatitis. Children are less likely than adults to complain of chills, arthralgia/myalgia or headaches and more likely to present with non-specific symptoms (fever, lethargy, malaise, somnolence): gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea) are particularly common.11, 12\nBox 1Important considerations in the assessment of a patient with possible malaria.\n\u2022Malaria is a medical emergency and patients with suspected malaria should be evaluated immediately.\u2022Symptoms of malaria are often non-specific: fever/sweats/chills, malaise, myalgia, headache, diarrhoea, and cough.\u2022Falciparum malaria is most likely to occur within 3 months of return from an endemic area.

Unless rapid malaria testing can be achieved in primary care, the patient should be referred to hospital for testing. Results should be communicated the same day: all positive tests should be telephoned back to the requesting doctor as soon as practicable and ideally within 4 h of the test reaching the laboratory. The most important test is examination of thick and thin blood smears by microscopy. This is highly sensitive and specific in expert hands. However, because of a lack of expertise in many UK labs, particularly out of hours, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) based upon detection of parasite antigens, are now commonly used in addition to blood slides. Although slightly less sensitive than good quality blood films examined by experienced microscopists, they are easier for the non-expert to use to detect falciparum infections and are useful as an initial screen if expertise in reading slides is not immediately available. RDTs are generally not as specific and sensitive for the detection of non-falciparum infections, although newer generation RDTs perform well in diagnosing vivax infection.13, 14 RDTs may be used in addition to, but not as a replacement for blood films and all patients with suspected malaria should have blood films prepared and examined as recommended in the British Committee for Standards in Haematology guidelines.15 If falciparum or knowlesi malaria is diagnosed, the percentage of red blood cells that are parasitized should be estimated.",

Thrombocytopaenia is suggestive of malaria in non-immune adults and children, both in non-falciparum malarias and in P. falciparum,16, 17 although it can also occur in a number of other imported infections. Malaria is unlikely if three negative specimens have been examined by a competent microscopist. Empirical therapy for malaria should not be given unless a patient with a convincing exposure history demonstrates features of severe malaria and expert advice has been taken. In pregnancy, thick films can be negative, despite the presence of parasites in the placenta. Expert advice should be sought if malaria is suspected.

Both ACTs need to be given for only three days. Although DHA piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) has the advantage of only needing single daily dosing, there has been concern about the potential for QTc prolongation with DHA-PPQ. Until further data become available, it is recommended that DHA-PPQ is taken more than 3 h after food and that patients should not eat for 3 h after doses of DHA-piperaquine to prevent excessive peak piperaquine levels. DHA-PPQ should not currently be used in patients with previous arrhythmias, cardiac conditions that predispose to arrhythmia, or those taking drugs that prolong the QT interval. ECGs should be obtained early in the course of treatment with DHA-PPQ and before and after the last daily dose of DHA-PPQ; more frequent monitoring may be indicated in those taking drugs which inhibit CYP3A4 and potentially increase piperaquine levels, such as clarithromycin.",

            "text": "In contrast to the three day regimens for ACTs and atovaquone\u2013proguanil, quinine needs to be taken for five to seven days, or until parasites have cleared, which requires daily monitoring. Quinine is often associated with \u201ccinchonism\u201d (nausea, deafness and ringing in the ears), which may result in poor adherence. Although international recommendations suggest that quinine should be taken for seven days in endemic areas,5 UK experience suggests that five days treatment is adequate for the vast majority of cases when combined with a second drug (doxycycline for adults or clindamycin in pregnant women and young children) to ensure complete eradication of parasites. The second drug can be taken either simultaneously with quinine or sequentially after the quinine. In view of increasing failure rates of anti-folate drugs in most part of the world, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar\u00ae) should not be used routinely as a second drug to accompany quinine, except on specialist advice. Chloroquine should NOT be used for the treatment of falciparum malaria. Antibiotics, including tetracyclines, sulfa drugs, macrolides and clindamycin, should only be used in combination therapies and not used alone for the treatment of malaria. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of azithromycin either alone or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of malaria.50\n",

Judicious and slow volume resuscitation is important in those children presenting with shock; the FEAST trial showed a detrimental effect of routine fluid bolus administration.83 Hypoglycemia is a common complication of severe malaria; serial blood glucose estimations must be performed, and hypoglycemia corrected using 5\u201310% glucose in maintenance fluid.68 As it is often difficult to exclude or differentiate concurrent bacterial septic shock or meningitis from severe malaria, empirical broad spectrum antibiotics should be given to children with severe malaria until bacterial infection can be excluded84 (Grade 1B). Management of seizures should follow the evidence-based guidelines advocated by the Advanced Paediatric Life Support Group.85 Blood transfusions may be required for severe anaemia, although a Cochrane review found that routine transfusion did not reduce mortality, but caused more adverse events.86\n",
