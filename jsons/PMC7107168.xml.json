IBV and IBV-like strains can be detected in both gallinaceous and non-gallinaceous birds, such as geese, ducks, pigeons, pheasants (Cavanagh et al., 2002), and quail (Circella et al., 2007; Torres et al., 2013), asymptomatically in some cases (Cavanagh, 2005). This might suggest that these species would act as vectors spreading IBV strains over the world (De Wit et al., 2011).",
