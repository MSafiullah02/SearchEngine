            "text": "The coronavirus outbreak has had an unprecedented effect worldwide, including fundamentally changing how pharmacy schools operate. A few weeks ago, we were planning a pharmacist oath and honors ceremony. This week, we are conducting emergency meetings to discuss delivery of remote curriculum and software that includes artificial intelligence proctoring of examinations. The issues are real. Howard University has followed the recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by adopting a remote classroom/virtual environment. 1 All instruction is now conducted through Blackboard Collaborate Ultra,\u00ae Zoom,\u00ae or Microsoft Teams.\u00ae All faculty were provided instructions and training regarding system operation and licenses were obtained for each of the departments in order to maintain academic continuity. Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) and simulation-based activities will be done in person with limits to the number of students allowed per session. Team-based learning activities, including mini OSCEs, have been moved online and will facilitate case discussion and interaction. Our experiential rotations will continue as scheduled due to the number of practicum hours required to obtain a pharmacy licensure in the U.S. Rotation sites that choose to conduct teaching via remote/non-live settings are given guidance by the Director for Experiential Education, in order to ensure we are meeting accreditation guidelines. 2 The Office of Experiential Education is prepared to reschedule rotations that are required and are not amenable to online training modalities. For now, all exams will be conducted remotely using strategies to minimize academic misconduct. High stakes exams, with limitation of the number of students, are still scheduled for onsite testing. Students and faculty have been informed that they should be prepared for the possibility that the academic semester will be extended to allow our students to complete their requirements for advancing to the next step or graduating, in the case of our P4 students. As of March 16, 2020, the University Commencement ceremony originally scheduled for May 9, 2020, has been cancelled, and we are in conversation with the graduating students to develop a way to honor and 2 celebrate their hard work over the past 4 years. 3 These are definitely uncharted waters. Some of the options we have considered include rescheduling the event entirely for the College of Pharmacy students or conducting a remote ceremony that will include student, faculty, staff, and family members.",

Initially, all our student interviews for the incoming Class of 2024 were changed to a hybrid model; however, as the situation deteriorated and we received word from the Administration that no more than 10 people can be in a gathering, the interviews were changed to an all online format. I am grateful for: 1) the leadership team that has sacrificed over spring break to ensure that we are all moving forward as a team; 2) the faculty who are willing to do what's necessary to serve our students;",

This is the time for us as pharmacists to be visibly present as essential during these difficult times. Our profession depends on it. I am hopeful that many hero stories will emerge from this crisis that will elevate the reputation of pharmacies and pharmacists so that it can inspire many to seek to be a part of this noble profession.
