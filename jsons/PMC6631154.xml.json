The linear double stranded DNA genome ranges in length from 26 to 48 kb and contains inverted terminal repeats of 36 to 371 bp [1,2]. The genome of adenoviruses is organized in at least 16 clearly defined genus-common genes, including the polymerase, and in a set of more variable genes, genus-specific, mainly located near the ends the genome [3]. Adenoviruses are classified into five genera by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), namely Atadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Ichtadenovirus, Mastadenovirus, and Siadenovirus [4]. The genus, Mastadenovirus, includes adenoviruses that infect only mammals, including humans, causing ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases [5,6].",

Since then, several bat adenoviruses have been identified [21,22,23], including the BtAdV-2 strain PPV1 [24] and BtAdV-3 strain TJM [25]. Attempts to classify BAtdVs have been made, taking into account the apparent genetic heterogeneity, through the bat species of origin and the geographic location. Thus far, all BtAdVs have been included into the genus, Mastadenovirus, and seven species have been proposed by ICTV (Table 1).",

The overall adenovirus prevalence was 17.4% in the examined bats. A limit of our investigation was the heterogeneous composition of the sample collection, chiefly in terms of bat species, as the major part of the samples (186/195, 95.4%) derived from the genera Pipistrellus (136/195, 69.7%) and Hypsugo (50/195, 25.6%) and only 9/195 (4.6%) originated from the genera Plecotus (3/195, 1.5%), Tadarida (1/195, 0.5%), and Eptesicus (5/195, 2.6%). Nevertheless, the sample\u2019s metadata were informative enough to suggest a possible age-related pattern of the infection, suggesting that adult animals are more prone to infection (p < 0.05, \u03c72 test).",

The impressive genetic variety of adenoviruses in bats poses a challenge for their nomenclature and classification. Upon phylogenetic analysis of the short diagnostic region spanning the DNA polymerase gene, the 17 strains were divided into at least 9 clusters/sub-clusters. Interestingly, bats from the genera, Pipistrellus and Hypsugo, appeared to share similar adenoviruses, suggesting inter-specific bat-to-bat circulation of adenoviruses.",

JN252129), forming a separate cluster and suggesting a potential novel BtAdV species. More interestingly, a BtAdv strain (PA21/16 PS), detected in Pipistrellus spp., rooted tightly with a unique adenovirus found in South American fur seals (SAFS) pups (Arctocephalus australis) in Per\u00f9 (GenBank accession number MF175113), and with avian adenoviruses (genus Aviadenovirus). The SAFS adenovirus was identified during a surveillance study for adenoviruses in breeding colonies of SAFS and Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) in Southern America. In the Southern American study, four mastadenoviruses, four aviadenoviruses and a siadenovirus were detected in SAFSs, whilst three mastadenoviruses, two aviadenoviruses, and three siadenoviruses were identified in Humboldt penguins that shared the same reproductive area in the Peruvian coast [38]. These findings are intriguing, as they indicate the possibility of inter-species transmission between avian and mammalian species and in our study this could have been accounted for by the fact that bats and birds may reach/occupy the same ecological niches (i.e., terminal branches of trees, rocks, or caves) due to their flying abilities. The possibility of a shift between avian and mammalian hosts for adenoviruses is not considered a common event, since adenoviruses are considered highly species-specific [3,7]. Yet, members of the Atadenovirus genus have been identified in distantly related animal species, including ruminants, poultry, reptiles, and a marsupial [39]. An additional hypothesis is that avian adenovirus DNA may contaminate bat food and that the detected virus was not replicating actively in the animal. Regardless, the resolution of the DNA polymerase region fragment targeted by the consensus PCR is likely not sufficient to discriminate firmly among the adenovirus genera and species and this preliminary piece of evidence should be confirmed by gathering larger, more informative sequences or, possibly, the full-length genome.",

When reconstructing the sequence and genome organization, the virus appeared virtually identical to the prototype strain PPV1 (GenBank accession no. JN252129), sharing 99.3% nt identity. Such a high nt identity between those two viruses is intriguing, as the two viruses have been identified approximately a decade apart from each other and in different geographical European countries, respectively, Germany and Italy [24]. Similar degrees of sequence conservation over time, geographical locations, and host species have been documented for canine adenoviruses type 1 and type 2. Both the canine viruses have long been recognized as canine pathogens and they are also able to infect several wild carnivores, with minimal genetic differences among the various isolates, suggesting a limited genetic diversification, likely due to optimal adaptation of those viruses to carnivores [27,40].",
