            "text": "In recent years, we have witnessed a vast advancement towards flexible and stretchable devices1,2. The current form-factor of medical devices that are rigid and boxy starts to become soft and conformable3,4. This brings out health monitoring that is non-obtrusive, imperceptible, and closer to our body, even when we are away from the hospital5. There are two major classes of wearable electronics for healthcare: on-skin, and textile electronics. Thin, soft and skin-like electronics in the form of a patch, with wireless capabilities, have been developed to precisely detect various physiological signals from the human body, such as electrophysiology6, temperature7, pulse oximetry8, blood pressure9, hydration10, and others11. They are made either by designing a particular structure that can withstand strain on a deformable polymeric substrate, or by using intrinsically stretchable materials12. On the other hand, textiles and clothing are ubiquitous in our daily life. We wear and wash them regularly, and they give us comfort and protection from the outside environments. Being the closest layer to our body, they provide an ideal platform for the integration of electronics to monitor physiological processes through the skin. Electronic devices integrated into textiles can, therefore, offer several advantages, such as enhanced mobility and comfort for the user13. Textile also serves an excellent substrate for sensing throughout dynamic activities and environments, where robustness and washability are critical as the substrate undergoes multiple stretching, friction, and is frequently exposed to dirt and humidity. Several efforts have been conducted to integrate electronics into textiles, for instance, by coating yarns with metal or printing conductive inks on fabrics to serve as electrodes for electrophysiology14,15, sewing and attaching functional threads and fabrics16, weaving electronics fabricated on polyimide strips for humidity17, temperature17, pulse oximetry18, and gas19 sensing, as well as developing electronic fibers for seamless woven electronic textiles20. Some of these intelligent textiles, however, are not scalable for large-area sensing and do not allow stretchability for the application of skin-contact sensing for electronic suits.",

            "text": "It is also worthy to note that current on-skin and wearable devices mostly measure a single parameter at a particular location of the body21. Distributed sensor networks that can spatiotemporally map multiple physiological processes and physical movements in different regions of the body (Supplementary Table 1) are a valuable tool for clinicians, as they can provide a rich dataset to assess a health condition, predict disease, or advance sports science and analytics22,23. A specific example is soft, battery-free epidermal sensors that can be adhered to various regions of the body to perform full-body skin temperature and physical pressure mapping24. These sticker-like sensors are used in sleep studies to help with the treatment of sleep disorders, jet lag, and pressure ulcers on a clinical bed setup. Distributed skin temperature mapping has also been demonstrated to study thermoregulation efficiency in athletic performance25, as well as dermatome abnormality through regional nerve root damage26. However, even though they are wireless, these epidermal sensors require a Near Field Communication (NFC) reader around the vicinity to power the electronics and collect the data. They would be also challenging to be used while performing dynamic activities, which limit its applications outside the bed. Their soft, fragile nature and adhesive tape application on the skin may restrain them from long-term operations. Other wireless on-skin devices are integrated with batteries27,28. However, having multiple devices with their independent power sources tend to be cumbersome when one needs to replace and charge every single device, rather than wearing a centralized, system-on-textile garment that could perform all of the functions. Several on-skin and textile electronic devices also require specific materials and microfabrication techniques to be developed, resulting in relatively high cost and effort for mass manufacturing and large-scale deployment29,30.",

Accordingly, a universal platform of sensor networks on textiles as well as their hardware-software integration, must be established34. With this standardization, industries can, therefore, work on specific parts, such as sensor modules and not be concerned about designing a full wearable system. Further processes can then focus on personalization of smart clothing based on the user\u2019s requirements and needs35.",

Our technique creates a platform to integrate a large assortment of conformable electronic components in a suit for large-scale physiological and physical activity sensing on the body. We demonstrate the capability of our electronic textile conformable suit (E-TeCS) for distributed, wireless physiological sensing, such as temperature, respiration and heart-rate detection, and physical activity monitoring around the human body during a physical exercise. Repeated mechanical cycling tests also prove the durability of the knitted textile for daily wear.",

The temperature sensor (MAX30205, Maxim Integrated) has an accuracy of 0.1 \u00b0C between 37\u201339 \u00b0C, and a 0.0039 \u00b0C resolution, which we rounded up programmatically to 0.01 \u00b0C. This sensor can have up to 32 unique addresses, which can be set by connecting ground (GND), power supply (VDD), data line (SDA) or clock line (SCL) signal to the A0, A1, and A2 pins on the chip. Given that there are eight combinations possible in these three pins for each signal, we designed four different hard-wired A0, A1, and A2 pins (Supplementary Fig. 1b) to voltage supply (VDD) or ground (GND) and data-line (SDA) or clock-line (SCL), represented by M, M1, M2, and M3. Each temperature module can be manually joined by soldering the jumpers (Supplementary Fig. 1c), in order to access all of the possible 32 addresses. The capacitor complement of the MAX3025 is used as a decoupling capacitor to stabilize the local VDD supply from high-frequency noise and voltage ripples. The mechano-acoustic sensor or inertial measurement unit (IMU) (MPU6050, InvenSense) is capable of measuring 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer, with a programmable accelerometer range of \u00b12 g to 16 g, the highest precision of 0.00012 g or 0.0012 m/s2, and a maximum of two addresses in one I2C bus.

            "text": "Using a flat two-bed digital knitting machine (Super-J 212, Matsuya), we patterned textile channels using a combination of two-layer jersey (left) and interlocked knitting (right), as illustrated in Fig. 3d. Figure 3e shows a region of the resultant fabric, with four textile channels and three interlocked stripes. The single-color stripes in this piece consist of two layers of separated fabric, while the dotted stripes represent the interlocked patterns, which combined two fabric layers into one. We digitally knitted three fabrics with a size of 55 \u00d7 120 cm: one for front-side, one for back-side, and one for a pair of long-sleeve. The channel design of our digitally knit fabric was done based on the size of our sensing and interconnect modules. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a, the width of our sensing and interconnect modules are 0.6 cm. Therefore, we decided to design 1 cm channels on our digitally knit fabric to provide enough room for these modules (Fig. 3e). Based on our design, the minimum distance between each sensor is 1 cm vertically based on the channel width, and 2 cm horizontally based on the interconnect module length. After the whole fabric was drafted, it was then cut for different body parts (Supplementary Fig. 5) using a personalized garment fitting measurement (Supplementary Table 3). Electronic-textile integration was then performed, by threading the electronic strips into the textile channel (Supplementary Fig. 6a), which is further explained in Methods and Supplementary Fig. 7. Finally, the sensor-integrated fabrics were then sewn into a bodysuit to form E-TeCS (Fig. 3f), as illustrated in detail in Supplementary Fig. 6b, with the inside of the E-TeCS shown in Supplementary Fig. 6c, d.",

All of the sensors going horizontally through the stripes are collected with four thin copper wires vertically (Supplementary Fig. 9) through the seams and connected to the main hub (MetaWearR, Mbientlab) through I2C protocol. The main hub consists of a microprocessor, BLE module, and rechargeable lithium polymer battery in a compact form. The lithium-polymer battery (401622, HYP) as shown in Supplementary Fig. 8f is rated at 3.7 V, 100 mAh and has a 2 h charging time. The total current consumption, while the main module and all of the sensor nodes are active, is approximately 18.6 mA. With the battery rated at 100 mAh, the working lifetime of our system is around 5 h and 20 min. We can improve this lifetime by using lithium-polymer battery with a higher capacity. As illustrated in Fig. 3g, we sewed conductive snaps that function as a textile-hardware connector to link the I2C pins on the microprocessor to the I2C wires on the textile. The pluggable mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 8b-e) allows the wireless communication and main processing hardware to be removed during charging of the battery. The I2C pins of this micro-controller are wired to the conductive snaps for the textile-hardware interface. Through wireless BLE communication, a computer can access all of the sensor addresses and log their data accordingly. These data can then be stored or visualized in real-time with python Matplotlib and pygame library.",

Using a disk sensor laminated on the skin, Mahanty and Roemer stated that a pressure of 2 mmHg is sufficient to accurately measure skin temperature, while a larger pressure of up to 20 mmHg will result in an increase of temperature due to the pressure exerted to the local tissue43. For wearable comfort, the compression pressure should not be more than 44.1 mmHg, which is close to the average capillary blood pressure of 32.3 mmHg near the skin44. As shown in Supplementary Table 3, a set of key tailoring measurements45 was used as a reference for the design of the E-TeCS. For pressure measurements, ten circumference points of a subject\u2019s arm and a compression sleeve were measured to calculate the size of the reduction, as calculated in Supplementary Table 4 and illustrated in Fig. 3i. By performing mechanical characterization on the base fabric, we can evaluate the fabric rigidity and model the pressure of elastic fabric around the upper limb region of the human body. These modeled values were also cross-validated with a high-accuracy compression fabric sub-bandage pressure monitor (Kikuhime, TT Meditrade)46, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 10. Figure 3h presents both the experimental and modeled pressure variations across the sleeve. The pressure values for both cases show a similar trend, with a maximum difference of 3 mmHg when the pressure variations are below 8.5 mmHg. These values, therefore, reflect the compression property of our E-TeCS for on-body sensing with a pressure variations of 2\u201320 mmHg and ensure a comfortable and reliable contact between the sensors and the skin.",

Most garment distortions happen due to the active movements of the upper body, such as shoulder movements, arm extension, and elbow diameter change46,50. According to Hatch, the typical stretchability range of textiles for a tailored garment is 15\u201325%, for sportswear is 20\u201335%, and for a form-fit compression garment is between 30\u201340%51,52. Based on these ranges, we expect our E-TeCS to withstand a strain of up to 30%. It was observed that both cases of stretchable interconnects could withstand 1000 stretching cycles at 30% elongation (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Both interconnects show stable, flat low resistance behavior as a conductor throughout the test (Fig. 4b, c and Supplementary Fig. 12e, f). Load versus strain graphs in Supplementary Fig. 12c, d illustrate the viscoelastic\u2013plastic behavior of the TPU53,54. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12b, at the first few cycles, there is a large gap and hysteresis shift of load due to the viscoplastic behavior of TPU, before the mechanical integrity of the TPU weakens and become more elastic at the rest of the stretching cycles. After the fatigue test, both samples showed an elongation of around 10%. Based on this result, there is always be a viscoplastic\u2013elastic adaptation on the first few cycles before the stretchable interconnects achieve a consistent mechanical response. Optimizations in serpentine design, materials choice, and substrate thickness can be performed to improve the durability of this type of stretchable interconnects48,49.",

Throughout the washing test, the textile patch underwent an initial warm wash, three cycles of rinsing, two cycles of draining, and a dry spin at the end. The temperature recordings reflect these events, while the accelerometer readings show four cycles of sequential slow spin, three cycles of continuous medium spin, and a cycle of fast spin for drying mode in the end. It can be observed that towards the end, the accelerometer values are saturated by the medium and fast spin. These tests thus prove the robustness of the encapsulation and interconnections of the system not only mechanically, but also electrically during delicate washing.",

This phenomenon occurs until perspiration starts and sweat evaporates from the eccrine glands of the skin, providing a cooling effect and decreasing the skin temperature throughout60. As the sweat permeates through the fabric, the temperature tends to stabilize towards the end of the resting period.

We can observe the intensity of the task, shown as periodic 3-axis waveforms that can be counted to 174 steps per minute, representing running at 6 mph (Fig. 5g). The increasing acceleration when the subject started running at a graded load (Supplementary Fig. 18a) and the transitioning acceleration as the subject slowed down to walking at three mph, corresponding to 120 steps per minute (Supplementary Fig. 18b), are also clearly visible. By zooming into the z-axis acceleration at rest, we can observe the mechano-acoustic waveforms, triggered by the subtle contraction and relaxation of the heart, lung, and diaphragm (Fig. 5h, i). Both figures represent raw data before any further processing, such as filtering. Before the exercise, we can see a clear breathing waveform in Fig. 5h, corresponding to 4 breaths per 10 s (24 breaths per minute) with small peaks of the beating heart of 18 spikes per 10 s (108 heartbeats per minute). After the subject performed a graded load exercise, a large amplitude of mechano-acoustic vibrations from the heart was visible due to the increase in cardiac output. As physical exercise intensity increases, the heart needs to pump more blood and oxygen supply to meet the demand of the body\u2019s muscles. The lung and respiratory system also respond to the intensity, with an increased breathing rate to compensate for the oxygen requirement of the body to release energy63,64. In correlation to the activity of these organs, after the exercise, both heart rate and breathing rate increased to 156 bpm and 54 bpm, respectively (Fig. 5i).",

Large-scale manufacturing of flexible printed circuit boards and knit fabrics and modular sensor networks enable a high-throughput, scalable system, resulting in: (1) large-area sensor coverage, and (2) a versatile platform for multimodal sensor integration. Not only did we produce our own fabric structures and patterns, but with garment design and patterning techniques, we also tailored the fabric into a suit for a tight fit, yet comfortable for conformal attachment to the curvature of the body. The engineered compression pressure across the body ensures each sensor\u2019s contact to the skin and minimizes dislocation from the sensing points. As our final prototype, we integrated 31 sensor islands into the tailored E-TeCS, including 30 temperature sensors spread across the upper-body region, and one accelerometer placed right below the sternum. Intense physical exercise was conducted to demonstrate the ability of E-TeCS to perform continuous spatiotemporal temperature sensing, as well as simultaneous mechano-acoustic sensing for the estimation of heart rate and breathing rate. Compared to IR thermography used in this work, our approach enables high-accuracy skin temperature sensing without being spatially limited by the camera\u2019s view or the need to be naked, expanding its applications in wearable sensing \u201con-the-go\u201d. The accelerometer could also detect subtle heart rate, respiration, and body movements for physical activity and physiological monitoring. Future studies may focus on incorporating additional sensing modalities such as humidity, pressure, optical, ultrasonic, gas, magnetic field sensors, and so on, demonstrating the E-TeCS capability during various activities outside the lab, and performing further optimization for electromechanical and washability study. The collective design and integration approach of E-TeCS, as well as the underlining experimental and implementation studies would be of interest in the development of flexible-stretchable and textile electronic systems. The multi-modal, multi-functional framework of E-TeCS will enable a new strategy of personalized telemedicine for rapid prototyping and deployment, especially during extreme conditions such as a pandemic or natural disaster relief efforts. It could advance mobile, comfortable, and continuous physiological and physical activity monitoring, with potential implications in healthcare, rehabilitation, and sports science not only in the hospital and laboratory, but also in home-care settings and eventually in outer-space applications.",

Weft knitting is a method of forming a fabric in which the loops are made in a horizontal way from a single yarn. With a two-bed knitting machine, single layer fabric can be realized by interlocking. Interlocking uses two sets of needles that knit back-to-back in an alternate sequence to create two sides of the fabric that are exactly in line with each other, forming one layer. Each yarn carrier holds 2-ply (75 denier each ply) of high-flex polyester yarns. Textile channels for electronic integration were knitted by allowing both the front and back needle beds to knit simultaneously and by making a spacer fabric with a hollow channel. The number of wale lines, which is 20 in this spacer fabric defines the width of the opening of around 1 cm while the course line number defines the width of the entire knit fabric (Fig. 5c). The rest of the fabric was formed through interlocking. Solder-tip melting (WP80, Weller) was performed to open the channels for the exposed part of the sensor modules with a distance of 1.5 cm.",

The optimal amount of strain can be determined after further testing the yield strain of the stretchable interconnects, the compression pressure, and on the fit of the suit. A seam allowance of 1.5 cm was used on the pattern pieces. The shirt (Fig. 3f) consists of a front, a back, two sleeves, and polo neckpieces. The raw edges of the seams were joined together using a zig-zag stitch with a sewing machine (CG590, Singer) as an overlocking stitch (Supplementary Fig. 6b).",
