Patients with abnormal liver function are more males, and usually have a moderate-high degree fever, significantly lower numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells, with a prolonged length of stay if abnormal liver function occurred during hospitalization.11 In deceased cases of COVID-19, the incidence of liver injury might reach as high as 58%\u201378%.12 Because COVID-19 can be transmitted from asymptomatic carriers, unexplained abnormal liver function should alert the physicians to consider the screening of COVID-19 if subjects with possible travel or contact history.",
