It should be noted that surgical masks for HCW in this department have been available only since March 9 (1); in another RT department (Barletta), PPE have been provided since March 10th (surgical mask and PPF2, cap, disposable gowns, glasses, glowes and shoe covers) and, since 14th March, visors and video training for the staff on the use of PPEs.",

At the moment of writing (April 18), the patient is expected to resume, after two further tests resulted negative. It should be noted that before stopping the irradiation, she had already been treated to the mediastinum with a cumulative dose of 10 Gy: despite the patient was screened according to the abovementioned guidelines, these were insufficient to prevent the start of the treatment, exposing both the patient and the staff. Conversely, if she had been tested before the radiotherapy start, the treatment would have not been started and the risk of sever pneumonia lowered.",

The first test was negative, but it should be repeated because the hypothesis of infection cannot be ruled out with just one test (4).

The same applies to the first reports from Italian regions (Lombardy and Piedmont) with figures of incidence of SARS-COV-2 closest to those of China: one of them (7) considers the situation of treating patient suspected or COVID-19-positive and the other (8) states that in positive anamnestic case they provide surgical mask to the patient and do not stop the treatment. The treatment of suspected (not to mention positive) patients is highly risky, for both the staff personnel and the patient herself. RT treatments may have a negative impact on the patients\u2019 immune system, thus causing the potential mortality rate for such patients to skyrocket. It is indeed impossible, in the situations described in the mentioned papers, to determine whether the patient was positive during the RT treatment.
