Those authors modified the original framework for literature reviews proposed by Cooper (1998) and suggested that an integrative review should include: (a) a clear statement identifying the problem or purpose of the review; (b) identification of the strategies used to search and identify relevant literature; (c) evaluation of the quality of the data; (d) analysis of the data; and (e) final synthesis and presentation of the data. Whittemore and Knafl (2005) acknowledged that many strategies can be used for each of these stages. The purpose of this review was to analyze the concept of global health diplomacy and identify implications of global health diplomacy for nursing practice, education, and research. The framework proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005) was used to organize the review. We did not find reports of empirical research other than descriptions of existing health-diplomacy programs, so our review focused on theoretical articles and empirical descriptions of global health initiatives. The articles included in this review were identified by searching the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PubMed databases using the search term \u201cglobal health diplomacy,\u201d without specifying any date restrictions. Additional articles were identified by reviewing reference lists of the original papers, and by searching Google Scholar using the keywords \u201cglobal health diplomacy.\u201d Empirical or theoretical articles were included in the review if they addressed the historical development of global health diplomacy, defined the components and challenges of health diplomacy, proposed future development of global health diplomacy, and/or discussed strategies for preparing global health diplomats.",

To analyze and synthesize the data from these diverse sources, the authors reviewed all papers, wrote annotated summaries of each paper, and then developed a system for classifying the articles, displaying the data, comparing the themes that emerged from each paper, and drawing inferences and conclusions, using the methods proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005). The review is organized according to the main themes that emerged from analysis of the papers: historical development of global health diplomacy, definition and components of global health diplomacy, challenges in global health diplomacy, and preparation of global health diplomats. The review concludes with the authors\u2019 recommendations and implications for nursing practice, education, and research.",

Identifying these different categories of global health diplomacy may be important to clarify services/resources that may be offered, especially when governments argue for incorporating health issues into their foreign-policy debates (Kaufmann & Feldbaum, 2009).",

Factors such as improved communication, educational levels, an end to colonial rule in many parts of the world, and increased public demand for civic participation has resulted in changes in the face of diplomacy. Fidler (2001) suggested that health diplomacy emerged because of global threats to public health in the 19th century. The Marshall Plan, the end of the Cold War era, and the medical assistance provided by the U.S. military in Europe and Japan following World War II signaled increased emphasis on the importance of foreign aid and \u201cpersuasion\u201d as a key component of foreign diplomatic initiatives in both the U.S. and in other countries (Adams, et al., 2008; Badeau, 1970).",

Feldbaum et al. (2010) suggested that although the World Health Organization (WHO) has had problems enforcing IHRs in the past, the 2003\u20132004 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) resulted in revision of IHRs and granted the WHO authority to supersede interests of member states using surveillance data for purposes of infectious disease control. Those authors further described the historical link between international aid and foreign policy interests, which was a key factor in the 1961 establishment of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).",

In addition, focusing on health as a political instrument often limits the ability of global health initiatives to address priority health problems in a sustainable way (Feldbaum, et al., 2010; Institute of Medicine, 2009a; Kickbusch & Buss, 2011; Kickbusch, Silberschmidt, & Buss, 2007). Ingram (2005) identified three potential problems with the use of health as a foreign policy tool: (a) decreasing the credibility of health workers who have previously been viewed as neutral and not involved with state politics; (b) giving priority to narrow state interests over the interests of alliances needed to address global health issues; and (c) focusing on health as a political instrument rather than a human rights issue.",

Wilson et al., 2012, Wilson et al., 2010, 2012 adapted these competencies for nurses, and surveyed nursing faculty in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America to identify their perceptions about whether the adapted competencies were appropriate for nurses. The competencies are divided into six broad categories: (a) global burden of disease; (b) health implications of travel, migration, and displacement; (c) social and environmental determinants of health; (d) globalization of health and healthcare; (e) healthcare in low resource settings; and (f) health as a human right and development resource. Survey responses were received from 561 nursing faculty members in the U.S. and Canada and from 56 nursing faculty in Latin America, indicating general agreement that the 30 competencies identified in these categories were important and appropriate for inclusion in nursing curricula. Although there is a need for further research to refine and validate these competencies, the survey results can be used to guide development of curricula to prepare nurses to contribute to addressing global health problems.",
