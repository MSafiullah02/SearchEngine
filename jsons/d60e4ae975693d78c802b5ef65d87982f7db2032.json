A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity h. The classical herd immunity level h C is defined as h C = 1\u22121/R 0 , where R 0 is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level h D , after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than h C . As an illustration we show that if R 0 = 2.5 in an agestructured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is h D = 43% rather than h C = 1\u22121/2.5 = 60%. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.",

            "text": "Covid-19 is spreading in most countries of the world and many different preventive measures are put in place to reduce transmission. Some countries aim for suppression by means of a total lockdown, and others for mitigation by slowing the spread using certain preventive measures in combination with protection of the vulnerable [1] . An important question for both policies is when to lift some or all of the restrictions. A highly related question is if and when herd immunity is obtained. Some regions and countries have already reached high estimates for the population immunity level, with 26% infected in metropolitan Stockholm region as per May 1 2020 [2] , while by the end of March [1] estimates for Italy and Spain as a whole were already around or above 10% and more recent. It is debated if the (classical) herd immunity level h C = 1 \u2212 1/R 0 , which for Covid-19 is believed to lie between 50% and 75% since common estimates of R 0 for Covid-19 typically lie in the range 2-4 (e.g. [1] ), is at all realistic to achieve without too many case fatalities [3, 4] Herd immunity is defined as a level of population immunity such that disease spreading will decline and stop also after all preventive measures have been relaxed. If all preventive measures are relaxed when the immunity level (from people having been infected) is clearly below the herd immunity level, then a second wave of infection will start once restrictions are relaxed.",

The first is to include age structure by dividing the community into different age cohorts, with inhomogeneous mixing between the different age cohorts. More precisely, we divide the community into 6 age groups and fit contact rates from an empirical study of social contacts [6] . Consequently, the person-to-person infectious contact rate between two individuals depends on the age groups of both individuals. The average number of infectious contacts an infected in age group i has with individuals in age group j now equals \u03bba ij \u03c0 j , where a ij reflects both how much an i-individual has contact with a specific j-individual but also typical infectivity of i-individuals and susceptibility of j-individuals, and \u03c0 j denotes the population fraction of individuals belonging to age cohort j.",

Here we take a simpler approach and assume that individuals can be categorized into three different activity levels: 50% of each age-cohort have normal activity, 25% have low activity corresponding to half as many contacts compared to normal activity, and 25% have high activity corresponding to twice as many contacts as normal activity. By this we mean that, for example, a high-activity individual in age group i on average has 2 * a ij \u03c0 j * 0.5 * 0.25 infectious contacts with low-activity individuals of type j. The factor 2 comes from the infective having high activity, the factor 0.5 from the contacted person having low activity, and the factor 0.25 from low-activity individuals making up 25% of each age cohort. The basic reproduction number R 0 for this model is given by the dominant eigenvalue to the (next-generation) matrix M having these elements as its entries. [5] .",

In order to also say something about the time evolution of the epidemic we assume a classical SEIR epidemic model. More precisely, we assume that individuals who get infected are initially latent for a period with mean 3 days, followed by an infectious period having mean 4 days, thus approximately mimicking the situation for Covid-19 (e.g. [1] ).

However, more complex and realistic models have many other types of heterogeneities: for instance increased spreading within households (of different sizes) or within schools and workplaces; and spatial aspects with rural areas having lower contact rates than metropolitan regions. It seems reasonable to assume that most such additional heterogeneities will have the effect of lowering the disease-induced immunity level h D S even further, in that high spreading environments (metropolitan regions, large households, big workplaces, ...) will have a higher fraction infected thus resulting in immunity being concentrated even more on highly active individuals. Some complex models do not categorize individuals into different activity levels, or the related feature in an underlying social network with varying number of acquaintances. As illustrated in our results section, differences in social activity plays a greater role in reducing the disease-induced herd immunity level than inhomogeneous agegroup mixing. Thus models not having such features will see smaller difference between h D and h C . Our choice to have 50% having average activity, 25% having half and 25% having double activity is of course very arbitrary. An important future task is hence to determine how size of differences in social activity within age groups. The more social heterogeneity there is between groups, the bigger difference between h D and h C .",

If at the time of such a contact the type j person is infectious and the type k person is susceptibe then the latter becomes latently infected (Exposed). People of the same type may infect each other, so a jj may be strictly positive. Because the definition of an infectious contact includes that the contact leads to transmission of the disease, it is not necessarily the case that a jk is equal to a kj . The parameter \u03b1 is a scaling parameter, used to quantify the impact of control measures in the main paper, without measures \u03b1 is set equal to 1. Exposed individuals become Infectious at constant rate \u03c3 and infectious individuals recover or die (are Removed) at constant rate \u00b5.

The parameters are again chosen so that R 0 = 2.5 when alpha = 1. The graphs show the effective R 0 (incorporating disease-induced immunity) as a function of time t, for four different choices of preventive level alpha. Thus all four curves coincide until day 30. The effective R 0 with no preventive measures (\u03b1 = 1) reaches the critical value of one on about day 57 (mid-April), whilst that for \u03b1 = 0.8 does so on about day 68 (April 23). The stronger preventive measures (\u03b1 = 0.6 and \u03b1 = 8/15) are such that herd immunity is never reached even if they are retained indefinitely.",
