This desire is understandable given the ease of treatment associated with antibiotics when the microbes display no resistance, and a common belief remains that, in principle, we could return to the glory days of the antibiotic era as if nothing had changed.5 However, we know that microorganisms can rapidly develop resistance against a variety of costly antimicrobial agents.6 This problem largely derives from their single mode of action which, a large body of evidence suggests, is the reason that it is only a matter of time for microorganisms to develop ample resistance.7\n",

The potentially new antibiotic teixobactin appears promising in this respect because it can attack alternative targets in the face of resistance; however, this antibiotic seems to be mainly active against only Gram-positive bacteria.8 Alternative safer and more efficient antimicrobial strategies are urgently needed\u2014including those with efficacy against Gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungal, viral, and protozoal pathogens.9 In this Personal View, we contend that the use of light-activated molecules (photoantimicrobials)10 is a viable option that deserves to be fully explored. We discuss photoantimicrobials and their uses and prospects for adoption as mainstream clinical antimicrobials in the fight against conventional drug resistance.",

Raab's supervisors, von Tappeiner and Jesionek, applied this approach to tumour cells and reported their results in 1905.12 Thus, both the antimicrobial and anticancer approaches of photodynamic therapy have been known for more than a century. Anticancer photodynamic therapy is now a clinical reality in hospitals and dermatology clinics worldwide, including for the treatment of actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma for more than 25 years,13 but antimicrobial photodynamic therapy is still largely unappreciated by clinicians and bodies responsible for health-care provision. Figure 1\nshows that photoantimicrobial discovery has been more extensive than that of conventional agents since 1900, with a substantial increase since the beginning of the so-called era of resistance.",

Reactive oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen, superoxide anions, and hydroxyl radicals, have a broad spectrum of activity and can destroy numerous molecular microbial targets (eg, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids),9, 14 which makes it very unlikely that the microbes can develop resistance. It is worth emphasising that internalisation of the drug is not a prerequisite for cell kill, which further prevents the onset of resistance15 and has been observed in vitro via the repeated sublethal photosensitisation of bacteria. This mechanism of action neither selects for photoantimicrobial resistance nor does it alter sensitivity to conventional antibacterial drugs.16\n",

Also, a rapidly acting photoantimicrobial intervention might help to prevent a localised infection becoming systemic. Localised infections are important in the clinic because a substantial percentage of health-care-associated infections originate from surgical wounds, many of which are located in the skin and soft tissues and can eventually cause systemic infections by invasion of the bloodstream. These considerations point to an urgent need for antimicrobials that work on multiple targets and on a local basis. The use of photoantimicrobials meets such requirements.",

The generated ROS rapidly react with their environment depending on the localisation of the excited PS\u2014eg, microorganism cell walls, lipid membranes, peptides, and nucleic acids.
