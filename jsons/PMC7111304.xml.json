            "text": "Influenza A virus, one of the zoonotic pathogen, have been rampant periodically throughout the world for centuries. In every year, about 500 million of human infections and 0.25\u20130.5 million of victims are generated in worldwide from respiratory diseases caused by influenza A viruses (Arias et al., 2009, Medina and Garcia-Sastre, 2011). Pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009 generated from swine in Mexico was created by multiple reassortment events (Vijaykrishna et al., 2010). It caused about 18,000 of human victims and was diagnosed in more than 214 nations for about 17 months from April, 2009 to August, 2010 according to the latest update from World Health Organization (WHO) (2009). Thus, early diagnosis of influenza A virus is of paramount importance to prevent human victims as well as economic damages (Lazcka et al., 2007). Among a number of diagnostic tools, the genetic analysis based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been considered most sensitive, specific and accurate (Hoffmann et al., 2001). Typically, the PCR method requires three distinct temperature for denature, annealing, and extension for thermal cycling. However, the precise temperature control inevitably increases the cost and bulkiness of the instrumentation, which hinders the on-site genetic analysis capability (Asiello and Baeumner, 2011, Parida et al., 2008). The ramping rate for transitioning between the three temperature zones takes time leading to elongating PCR process. Moreover, the enzyme activity can be reduced as the repeated thermal cycling proceeds continuously. To overcome these limitations of the conventional PCR, isothermal amplification methods such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (Notomi et al., 2000), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) (Compton, 1991), rolling circle amplification (RCA) (Lizardi et al., 1998), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) (Vincent et al., 2004), and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) (Piepenburg et al., 2006, Rohrman and Richards-Kortum, 2012, Shin et al., 2013) have been recently developed (Morisset et al., 2008). Isothermal amplification employs one mild temperature with specifically designed primer sets to boost up the quantity of the target gene. Among isothermal amplification methods, LAMP uses six primers and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement reaction at 60\u201365 \u00b0C within 1 h (Notomi et al., 2000). Since six primer sets of LAMP recognize eight distinct sequence on the target gene, the specificity of the gene amplification is available. Since a simple water bath or a heating block can substitute a thermal cycler for temperature control, a miniaturized genetic analysis system is more feasible for on-site viral detection (Parida et al., 2008). Regarding the detection of influenza virus, the RNA template is generally targeted and the reverse transcription should be performed as a first step. To this end, reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was also developed by adding reverse transcriptase enzymes under the identical reaction conditions of LAMP (Mori and Notomi, 2009). Using the RT-LAMP, various epidemics and epizootics such as a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Thai et al., 2004), influenza A virus (Ito et al., 2006), and foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) (Dukes et al., 2006) were identified.",

            "text": "On the other hand, microfluidic technology has demonstrated its high performance in the chemical and biological analysis with low sample consumption, high speed, high integration, automation and portability. Thus, the combination of the microfluidic device with the RT-LAMP content can provide an advanced pathogen analysis methodology (Chang et al., 2013, Hataoka et al., 2004). Fang et al. (2011) reported a PDMS\u2013glass hybrid microdevice for RT-LAMP with a reflected optical sensor to detect multiplex influenza A viruses. Wang et al. (2011) demonstrated an RT-LAMP microdevice which integrates a magnetic bead mediated RNA purification. In this platform, a nervous necrosis virus was analyzed within 60 min and the detection sensitivity was 100-fold higher than a conventional RT-PCR. Full integration of RNA purification by a Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) membrane, an RT-LAMP reaction, and real-time fluorescence detection on a chip was presented to identify HIV particles by Liu et al. (2011). However, the previously reported RT-LAMP microdevices necessitates intermittent manual operation for sample loading, and complex tubing systems for fluidic control, which unavoidably cause the contamination issues during RT-LAMP and reduce the data reproducibility (Chen et al., 2010, Oakley et al., 2009). Thus, an advanced microdevice, which integrates all the necessary steps and is operated automatically without complicated tube networks and human intervention, is desired for more reliable point-of-care pathogen detection.",

Thus, a variety of biochemical applications on the centrifugal microdevice platform including cell lysis and PCR (Kellogg et al., 2000), ion sensor (Grumann et al., 2005), alcohol assay (Steigert et al., 2006), and immunoassay have been reported (Haeberle et al., 2006). We also developed the centrifugal sample pretreatment microsystem by incorporating silica microbeads on a chip (Jung et al., 2013). As for the pathogen detection applications, Lutz et al. (2011) presented a centrifugal lab-on-a-foil platform for RPA based Staphylococcus aureus identification. Despite of the high sensitivity and rapidity, the DNA extraction step was performed on the off-chip basis. Hoehl et al. (2014) showed a centrifugal LabTube platform to automate DNA purification and LAMP amplification to detect verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). Although all the steps proceeded with reduced human intervention, the used volume of the reagents was equivalent to that of the commercial kit, rendering the rapid and efficient amplification difficult, and the colorimetric detection was limited for quantitative analysis.",

The capillary valve (100 \u03bcm depth, orange color in Fig. 1a) was patterned in the inner part of the RNA sample inlet to prevent backflow into the washing and elution solution reservoirs. A weir structure (100 \u03bcm depth) was fabricated to pack the TEOS-treated microbeads (150\u2013212 \u03bcm diameter) according to our previous report (Jung et al., 2013).

The siphon channel (580 \u03bcm (width)\u00d7100 \u03bcm (depth), orange color on the left in Fig. 1a) bridged between the elution solution reservoir and the bead-bed microchannel. The capillary valve in the elution solution reservoir was employed for storing the liquid safely, while the siphon channel was used prior to the elution solution reservoir in order to sequentially load an RNA sample, a washing solution, and an elution solution. Similarly, the RT-LAMP cocktail reservoir was patterned with a capillary valve and a siphon channel, so that the RT-LAMP cocktail could be moved to the RT-LAMP chamber before the loading of the elution solution (see the details of the flow control in the integrated RT-LAMP microdevice in Supplementary material).",

For example, the used washing solution was 70% ethanol which has low contact angle. Due to the high wettability of 70% ethanol, the loaded washing solution tends to uncontrollably move along the channel wall, once loaded. To prevent such a random flow, the washing solution reservoir was patterned as shown in Fig. 1b(i). First, a ring structure (200 \u03bcm depth) was fabricated to induce strong capillary force, which can hold the loaded washing solution inside the ring pattern. The capillary force should be strong enough to endure the liquid pressure to inhibit the washing solution leakage. Fig. 1b(ii) shows the bottom view of the washing solution reservoir which displayed the inner and outer ring patterns. The depth of the pattern was roughly calculated in Supplementary material in detail. In order to prevent wetting of a top sealing tape during the injection of a washing solution, a 250 \u03bcm deep pattern was fabricated, which ensured the perfect sealing of an adhesive tape to eliminate the contamination and evaporation issues during RT-LAMP process (Focke et al., 2010). Both the elution solution reservoir and the RT-LAMP cocktail reservoir were also designed with a ring pattern with 250 \u03bcm depth to firmly store the liquid during the injection step (Fig. 1c(i) and (ii) shows the bottom view of those reservoirs).",

Immediately, the washing solution was followed to purify the captured RNAs by removing the remaining salts and proteins adsorbed on the bead-bed (blue color in Fig. S2b(ii)). Centrifugation was conducted further at 5000 RPM for 290 s (counter clockwise) to dry completely any residual ethanol in the microbeads, which might play a role as an inhibitor for gene amplification. At this step, the waste solutions derived from the RNA sample and the washing solution were transported to the waste chamber.

While the RT-LAMP cocktail was directly transported to the RT-LAMP chamber earlier, the RNase-free water passed through the bead-bed microchannel to deliver the purified RNAs into the RT-LAMP chamber afterwards. Since the rotational direction was opposite to the initial step, the driving force was exerted on the bottom right. So, the RNase-free water, which carried the purified RNAs, was moved to the RT-LAMP chamber, not to the waste chamber. We prolonged this step for 90 s to fully recover the residual water on the microbeads as shown in Fig. S2b(iv\u2013vi).

For real-time monitoring of genetic amplification, a miniaturized optical detector was installed to the rotary portable microsystem. The collimated beam from the optical fluorescence detector is focused on the RT-LAMP chamber by emitting 488 nm laser and the fluorescence signal in the range of 500\u2013530 nm was detected by a photomultiplier tube with high sensitivity. As shown in\nFig. 2a, the fluorescence emission from the three RT-LAMP chambers were serially measured by the optical detector every 1 min when the chip rotated 120\u00b0. A detection hole was fabricated on the system cover made of Teflon for installation of an optical detector. Thus, real-time monitoring of the RT-LAMP amplification could be performed with the system cover tightly sealed as shown in Fig. 2b.",

The initial state of the RT-LAMP chamber has orange color due to the quenched calcein metal indicator which was combined with manganous ions (Mn2+) (Fig. 3a). At this stage, the chamber did not emit any fluorescence signal (\u03bb\nex=488 nm/\u03bb\nem=515 nm) (Fig. 3c). As the RT-LAMP reaction was carried out for 40 min, the color of the reaction mixture was changed to yellow. The reason for the color change is that the generated pyrophosphate ions (P2O74\u2212) during the RT-LAMP deprived of the combined Mn2+ ions, and the calcein was complexed with magnesium ion (Mg2+) in the reaction mixture, which produced strong fluorescence (Fig. 3b and d) (Tomita et al., 2008).",

The real-time RT-LAMP profiles were depicted as shown in\nFig. 4a. The fluorescence signals gradually increased even with 10 copies of influenza A H1N1 viral RNAs. The reaction time for transcending the threshold value (a dashed line in Fig. 4a) was reduced as the number of RNA templates increased. The positive fluorescence signals were observed within 20 min, and the signal intensities became plateau after 30 min in all cases. For quantitative analysis, a standard curve was established by plotting the threshold time versus the logarithm of RNA copy number with triplicate experiments (R\n2=0.9924) (Fig. 4b). Total processing time was 47 min including 7 min for the RNA purification and 40 min for the RT-LAMP reaction.

The influenza A virus could be identified with 102 copies in the real-time RT-PCR method. Thus, the detection sensitivity of our integrated centrifugal microsystem was enhanced by 10-fold compared with that of the conventional real-time RT-PCR. Whereas the conventional PCR requires time-consuming thermal cycling steps, the isothermal amplification needs only single reaction temperature. In addition, rapid amplification can be realized in the microfluidic-based platform owing to the smaller thermal inertia, low thermal mass, and high surface to volume ratio of the reaction chamber. Thus, our microfluidic based isothermal amplification system produced higher sensitivity than that of the conventional real-time RT-PCR (Chang et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Rapid subtyping of influenza A virus is critical for early medical pretreatment and prognosis. To this end, the subtyping test of an influenza A H1N1 virus was investigated on the integrated RT-LAMP microsystem. H1 gene and M gene were targeted to identify influenza A H1N1 virus. The RT-LAMP cocktails which contained H1 gene specific primer sets and M gene specific primer sets were loaded in the RT-LAMP cocktail reservoirs separately, and the RNA purification and the RT-LAMP reaction were conducted simultaneously. In this case, we used viral lysates directly as a sample solution instead of purified RNAs. As shown in\nFig. 5a, both the H1 and M gene were successfully amplified, resulting in the improved fluorescence signal along with the reaction time. The threshold time gap (8 min for M gene and 11 min for H1 gene) may be due to the difference of the primer binding affinity on the target template and the amplification efficiency during the RT-LAMP reaction. Since our integrated microdevice could perform three RT-LAMP reactions at one time (Fig. 2a), the subtyping of influenza A virus was possible. Following the previous subtyping of influenza A virus, we tested the specificity of H1 targeting primer sets by applying them for amplifying H3 and H5 genes. Influenza A H3N2 and H5N1 viral lysates were used as RNA templates, and the fluorescence signal was real-time monitored on a chip (Fig. 5b). In both samples, there were no amplicons produced, showing the fluorescence intensities at the background level even after 40 min. These results indicate that the H1 targeting primer sets were specific to the H1 gene (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, when the M gene targeting primer sets were used, the M gene was amplified in both influenza A H3N2 and H5N1 viruses as the reaction time went by. Thus, the designed M gene primers were successfully targeting the conserved region of M gene, and universal to identify the influenza A virus. The RT-LAMP microdevice allows us to pathotype and subtype the influenza A virus at one time.",
