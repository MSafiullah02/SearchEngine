In fact, pressure equalizing tube placement (ear tubes) and adenotonsillectomy are among the most frequent surgical interventions in the pediatric population. Therefore, every anesthesiologist who manages children undergoing otolaryngologic procedures must be familiar with the special implications of sharing the pediatric airway with an otolaryngologist working in the head and neck region. In addition, it is imperative to be skilled in the challenges of compassionately yet safely managing anxious young patients and their parents from the time of preoperative assessment until discharge from the post anesthesia care unit.",

This renders the endotracheal tube (ETT) relatively inaccessible to the anesthesiologist. Extra care should be taken to ensure that the tracheal tube is securely fastened and that there are no kinks. The anesthesia circuit should be secured; however, it should not be anchored tightly to the patient or the operating room table since the otolaryngologist may move the head during the procedure which may result in inadvertent extubation or mainstem intubation. Also, decisions regarding the placement (e.g., nasal vs. oral, left-side vs. right-side), and the type (e.g., oral RAE, named after the inventors Ring, Adair & Elwyn, nasotracheal) of ETT are primarily dictated by patient considerations, the surgical procedure, and the otolaryngologist's preference. Therefore, a discussion between the anesthesiologist and the otolaryngologist should take place prior to the induction of anesthesia. may result in excessive fl exion of the neck that necessitates placement of a shoulder role to provide adequate visualization of the larynx. The tongue is large in comparison with the oral cavity making mask ventilation and laryngoscopy more dif fi cult. The epiglottis is relatively long, omega shaped, fl oppy, and angled away from the axis of the trachea. This makes visualization of the glottic opening dif fi cult with a curved laryngoscope blade placed in the vallecula. Therefore, visualization of the glottic opening is more easily achieved with a straight rather than curved laryngoscope blade. The infant larynx is more cephalad than the adult larynx, lying at the C3-4 level in contrast to the C4-5 level of the adult larynx. In preterm infants, the larynx is even more cephalad, at the C3 level. The more cephalad position of the larynx makes the straight laryngoscope blade more effective for visualizing the airway than a curved blade.",

Clinically, this can result in the ETT passing easily through the vocal cords but fi tting tightly in the subglottic area. Since the cricoid cartilage forms a complete ring that is not expandable, a snug ETT can compress the tracheal mucosa [ 1 ] , possibly leading to laryngeal edema, post-extubation stridor or even residual stenosis. Based on this, the traditional teaching is that uncuffed ETTs should be used in the pediatric patient until the age of 8-10 years. The appropriate sized tube is determined by age [ 2 ] (Table 20. 2 ).",

Since the adult tracheal mucosal capillary pressure is considered to be 30 cm H 2 O, the leak should be less than 30 cm H 2 O but above the peak in fl ation pressure (PIP) generated during positive pressure ventilation. The leak is determined by listening over the patient's mouth while the PIP slowly rises by incremental closure of the adjustable pressure-limiting (APL) valve. The pressure at which a leak is fi rst heard determines how snug the fi t is.

For example, if a 5.0 uncuffed ETT is calculated, a 4.5 cuffed ETT should be placed (Table 20 .2 ). The presence for a leak should be ascertained as described above and the cuff adjusted accordingly. Additional evidence to support the use of cuffed ETTs is that the cricoid ring is not circular but ellipsoid, with the transverse diameter being greater than the anterior to posterior diameter [ 7 ] . Thus, a round uncuffed ETT may place excessive pressure on the mucosa anteriorly and posteriorly when trying to occlude a leak that is caused by the larger transverse diameter. A cuffed ETT seals the airway at the tracheal level allowing for a more even pressure distribution when in fl ating the cuff.",

Appropriate positioning of the ETT is crucial to avoid endobronchial intubation or, if using a cuffed ETT, to avoid herniation of the cuff through the vocal cords. Due to the short length of the trachea in infants, there is less room for error. As measured at the alveolar ridge, appropriate insertion distance is as follows: 10 cm for a newborn, 11 cm for a 1 year old, and 12 cm for 2 years old [ 10 ] . The formula 12 + age/2 [ 11 ] or 13 + age/2 [ 12 ] is used for children older than 2 years. Of course, auscultation for equal bilateral breath sounds should be the fi nal determinant of appropriate ETT position. Flexion of the head displaces the ETT distally whereas head extension displaces the ETT proximally possibly resulting in accidental extubation [ 9, 13 ] . Placement of a tongue depressor in the mouth causes distal displacement of the ETT as well [ 13 ] . During otolaryngologic procedures, head extension commonly occurs, particularly during adenotonsillectomy, which may displace the ETT proximally. Placement of a mouth retractor may displace the ETT distally. Therefore, after positioning for adenotonsillectomy, position of the ETT should be recon fi rmed.",

During periods of increased negative pressure in the thorax, the chest wall collapses to a greater degree than in the older child resulting in an increased work of breathing and decreased ventilation. This is even more evident when airway obstruction exists. Furthermore, the intercostal and diaphragmatic muscles are immature. There are two types of muscle fi bers, Type I and Type II. Type I muscle fi bers consist of slow-twitch, high-oxidative fi bers and are important for sustained activity. Type II muscle fi bers consist of fast-twitch, low-oxidative fi bers, and are important for short bursts of increased activity. The diaphragm in the infant is composed of 25% Type I muscle fi bers in contrast to the adult that has 55% Type I muscle fi bers. The infant's intercostal muscles are composed of 45% of Type I muscle fi bers whereas in the adult there are 65% Type I muscle fi bers. This places the infant at risk for respiratory fatigue when challenged with airway obstruction for a prolonged period of time. The adult composition of muscle fi bers is achieved by 1 year of age [ 15 ] . For these reasons, decreased chest wall compliance and decreased presence of Type I muscle fi bers, it is recommended that infants less than 12 months of age should be tracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated during general anesthesia except for possibly a short procedure lasting less than 1 h. Alveolar ventilation ( A V ) in the infant is two to three times the adult value and is due to an increased respiratory rate since TV on a per kilogram basis (7 mL/kg) is the same in the infant and the adult. This accounts for the more rapid onset of general anesthesia during an inhalation induction in the infant when compared to an adult.",

Therefore, vagal stimulation, such as during laryngoscopy, and hypoxia will result in signi fi cant bradycardia that in turn will result in a decreased cardiac output. Also, succinylcholine has been described to cause bradycardia with the fi rst dose. In the past, most pediatric patients arrived to the operating room signi fi cantly sedated. When these sedated patients were induced with halothane, the induction agent of choice before sevo fl urane, signi fi cant bradycardia and hypotension occurred. For this reason, many anesthesiologists routinely administered anticholinergic premedication, either atropine or glycopyrrolate, prior to or during induction. This practice has changed over the last two decades [ 17, 18 ] because of the use of newer anesthetics that do not cause excessive secretions or bradycardia. In addition, although premedication is still used, the depth of sedation is much less than it was in the past and bradycardia is rarely seen on induction of general anesthesia. Even the premise that succinylcholine causes signi fi cant bradycardia with the fi rst dose has been challenged [ 19 ] . Indications for anticholinergic premedication are listed in Table 20 .6 . The dose of atropine depends on the age of the child. A minimum dose of 0.1 mg has been advocated because of the theoretical concern of bradycardia occurring if a smaller dose is administered. However, this would be a massive dose on a per kg basis if given to a preterm infant and has resulted in tachycardia greater than 200 for a prolonged period of time. The current recommendation for atropine dosing is as follows: <5 kg: 20 mcg/kg \u00b3 5 kg: 10-20 mcg/kg with a minimum dose of 0.1 mg",

Stimulation of the larynx, either by laryngoscopy or secretions, during \"light\" anesthesia may result in either partial or complete laryngospasm [ 24 ] . Both partial and complete laryngospasm share the same clinical signs of tracheal tug and paradoxical movement of the chest and abdomen. They are differentiated by the presence of a high-pitched inspiratory sound in partial laryngospasm versus the absence of respiratory sounds in complete laryngospasm [ 25 ] . If not treated expeditiously, rapid oxygen desaturation and bradycardia will ensue. Therefore, atropine and succinylcholine should always be available, in both intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) doses, when caring for these patients. Treatment of partial laryngospasm consists of removing the noxious stimulus (surgical stimulus, secretions), applying positive pressure to the airway with 100% oxygen, and deepening the anesthetic with either a volatile agent or propofol (0.5 mg/kg) [ 26 ] . If these maneuvers fail, succinylcholine, 1-2 mg/kg IV or 4 mg/kg IM, should be administered. Atropine, 20 mcg/kg IV/IM, should be administered if hypoxia and bradycardia occurs [ 27 ] . Complete laryngospasm rarely resolves with positive pressure alone and a jaw thrust maneuver should be applied [ 27 ] . Alternatively, pressure on the laryngospasm notch ( Fig. 20 .1 ) has been shown to cause relaxation of the vocal cords. The laryngospasm notch is located behind the ear in the area posterior to the ascending ramus of the mandible, anterior to the mastoid process, and caudad to the base of the skull. Pain caused by pressure in this area results in afferent input to the vocal cords causing them to relax [ 28, 29 ] .",

While not every minor cold necessarily precludes a safe anesthetic, one must never compromise the patient's safety out of deference to convenience. URI in the pediatric patient undergoing general anesthesia is associated with an increased risk of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, secretions clogging the ETT, post-extubation stridor, and desaturation in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) requiring supplemental oxygen [ 30, 31 ] . Although these complications are real, multiple studies have shown that they do not result in signi fi cant morbidity when identi fi ed and treated appropriately [ 30, 32, 33 ] . Risk factors associated with increased incidence of adverse respiratory events are listed in Table 20 .7 [ 30 ] .

It is the authors' opinion that postponing surgery for 3-4 weeks is a reasonable option.

The incidence of MH varies but what is clear is that there is a higher incidence of MH in the pediatric versus adult population [ 38 ] . However, the incidence of MH may be decreasing because of the decreased routine use of succinylcholine in the pediatric population secondary to reports of hyperkalemic arrest in patients with undiagnosed muscular disease [ 39 ] . Therefore, any anesthesiologist caring for the pediatric patient should be aware of the clinical manifestations of MH and know how to diagnose and treat it. Additionally, obtaining a prior history of MH, in the patient and family, should be part of every preoperative evaluation so that appropriate preparation can be made prior to the initiation of any anesthetic. The reader is referred to the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States website ( www.mhaus.org ) and to other major pediatric texts for an extensive review of this disorder as well as how to manage these patients.",

A developmentally appropriate program is designed based on the needs of the individual pediatric patient and includes a tour of the hospital, a video of a typical induction of general anesthesia, and introduction to some of the anesthetic equipment (e.g., face mask). Younger children are provided with a medical kit and a doll they can \"doctor\" to play out their upcoming surgical experience.

This option is often not possible in the uncooperative awake pediatric patient. In these patients, sedation or anesthesia is required but with great care to maintain spontaneous ventilation. This can be accomplished either with a potent inhalation agent and 100% oxygen or judicious use of intravenous agents. Remifentanil infusion can provide adequate intubating conditions [ 56 ] and is easily reversed in case of signi fi cant respiratory depression. Propofol should be used with extreme caution in that it may cause cessation of spontaneous ventilation or potentiate respiratory depression when used in combination with opioids. Dexmedetomidine may be useful in this situation as well [ 57, 58 ] . Muscle relaxants should never be administered unless manual control of the airway is assured. Caution should be exercised, however, since at times muscle relaxation can make an easily ventilated airway impossible.",

While the muscle tone diminishes cyclically during sleep, the pressure in the airway is generally above the critical closing pressure (CCP), which is needed to maintain airway patency. However, the airway can collapse when muscle tone is inadequate to maintain a patent lumen, as with sedative drugs, alcohol, or in patients with neuromuscular hypotonia. The airway can also collapse if the luminal air pressure, which is holding the tube open, drops suf fi ciently.

Also, the presence of blood in the airway may make visualization with the fl exible bronchoscope dif fi cult, if not impossible. Thus, a rapid sequence induction is usually performed. However, in the situation where there is signi fi cant concern about the airway, a smooth mask inhalation induction with cricoid pressure can be performed with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position with the head down (tonsillar position) with suction immediately available. The tonsillar position minimizes aspiration risk by promoting the pooling of blood in the orapharynx. The choice of IV induction agent will depend on the volume status. Etomidate or ketamine may be used if there is ongoing concern about volume status and hemodynamic stability. Alternatively, propofol may be used but in a decreased dose. Muscle relaxation can be achieved with either succinylcholine or rocuronium. However, the duration of action of rocuronium at the dose recommended for rapid sequence induction (1.2 mg/kg) will likely exceed the length of the procedure. Furthermore, in situations where the airway is of major concern, succinylcholine, with its rapid onset and short duration of action, may be preferable, despite the concern of its use in the pediatric population.",

Suctioning of the stomach after induction but prior to inserting the bronchoscope may be helpful in decreasing the risk of gastric aspiration. Tracheal intubation is possible when esophageal foreign bodies are present. However, cricoid pressure during rapid sequence induction may be contraindicated if the foreign body is at the level of the cricopharyngus. Of note, the ETT may become compressed by the esophagoscope and can be detected by close monitoring of the peak airway pressure and the presence and quality of the ETCO 2 waveform.",

There is a theoretical concern that controlled ventilation and positive pressure may push the foreign object deeper into the small airways making retrieval more dif fi cult or creating a greater obstruction through a \"ball-valve\" effect. Conversely, spontaneous ventilation may prove inadequate to maintain adequate oxygenation or ventilation and increases the risk of unexpected movement or coughing causing airway trauma or rupture. Although both methods of ventilation are acceptable, studies have shown that the need for conversion from spontaneous to controlled ventilation occurs frequently [ 86, 103 ] . The reverse, conversion from controlled to spontaneous, has not been reported. The ultimate decision will be based on the preference of the anesthesiologist and otolaryngologist, the medical condition of the patient, and the nature of the foreign body aspiration.",

If an unsheathed optical forceps is used in place of a ventilating bronchoscope (which is occasionally a useful technique in very small airways), total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) will be necessary.

When the otolaryngologist enters the trachea, a large leak will develop causing a loss of tidal volume possibly compromising oxygenation and ventilation. It is during this time that communication between the otolaryngologist and anesthesiologist is of paramount importance. If oxygenation and ventilation become signi fi cantly compromised, it may be necessary for the otolaryngologist to stop and occlude the opening made in the trachea. This maneuver may be necessary multiple times until the tracheotomy tube is ready to be inserted. Non-absorbable Prolene or nylon stay sutures (4-0 in infants, 3-0 in older children) are placed on either side of the tracheal opening to stabilize the trachea for cannulation. Postoperatively and prior to establishment of the tracheal tract, these stay sutures may be life-saving in the event that the tracheotomy tube becomes dislodged and re-insertion of an airway device becomes necessary. The stay sutures should be clearly marked right or left so that pulling on the sutures in the proper direction results in opening of the tracheotomy site. Absorbable sutures are used to adapt the skin to the tracheotomy site, maturing the tract, making the surgical airway more stable and minimizing the possibility of passing a tube into a false passage.",

They can be found at any site in the upper aerodigestive tract, but they are most common, and most potentially dangerous, in the laryngotracheal complex. Presenting symptoms consist of stridor and hoarseness. Rapid growth of the papillomas results in progressive airway obstruction and some of these patients present emergently to the operating room. Because the papillomas cannot be eradicated surgically, these children frequently return to surgery for debulking at intervals, with the timing being dictated by the rapidity of papilloma regrowth. The goal of surgical resection is to maintain a safe airway without causing permanent damage to the larynx.

Appropriate highdensity masks should be worn by all operating room personnel in close contact to the smoke plume emanating from the airway.

Surgical drapes are fl ammable, and are unnecessary for this procedure, so should not be used. The patient's head and neck should be shielded with saline soaked towels, as mentioned above. The laser should always be switched off or in stand-by mode when not in use by the surgeon. Airway fi res are caused by the laser beam contacting fl ammable material in the airway such as polyvinyl chloride ETTs or cotton pledgets. Therefore, during laser surgery of the airway, a specialized ETT should be used that will not catch on fi re if contacted by the laser beam. Red rubber tubes wrapped with re fl ective aluminum have been used in the past, but such a coating may easily fail. Furthermore, the aluminum wrap can be applied only up to the cuff leaving the area below the vocal cords vulnerable to fi re. Commercially available laser-safe tubes that have metal exteriors are more commonly used. However, their use in small infants or patients with narrowed airways is limited because of the larger outer diameter of laser-safe tubes when compared with the same sized PVC tube. The larger sized tubes come with two cuffs so that if the laser beam damages the proximal cuff, the second cuff will remain in fl ated and protect the airway. The cuffs should be fi lled with a normal saline solution not air. In this way, if the laser beam ruptures the proximal cuff, the spray of saline solution may extinguish early combustion, thereby, preventing an airway fi re [ 111 ] . In some cases, the ETT can be dispensed with altogether during RRP excision by relying on apneic technique with intermittent intubation between brief laser sessions. This is challenging, however, for both the otolaryngologist and the anesthesiologist, and should not be the method of choice since better alternatives exist. Because oxygen increases the combustibility of fl ammable materials, the inspired concentration of oxygen should be kept at less than 30%, as long as adequate oxygenation of the patient is maintained. Nitrous oxide should be avoided as well since it can support combustion at 450 \u00b0C [ 95 ] .",

This may be due to postoperative mucosal changes, or simply the fact that tracheotomy is done in patients with the most aggressive disease.

Once the airway has been secured in this manner and ventilation con fi rmed, tracheotomy may be done over the bronchoscope. Attempts at replacing the bronchoscope with an endotracheal tube using the Seldinger technique would inappropriately risk loss of the airway and exacerbating the existing airway compromise.

This would be the responsibility of a second endoscopist.

It is best to avoid the need for intubation in the fi rst place if possible (through the use of steroids, racemic epinephrine or heliox). If intubation is required, the smallest tube which will allow for adequate ventilation should be used, and extubation should be done as soon as clinically feasible. Since in cases of croup, visualization of the glottis is not typically a problem, consideration should be given to nasotracheal intubation. By fi xing the endotracheal tube at the nares instead of the oral commissure, motion of the ETT (with associated axial shearing trauma of the subglottic mucosa) may be minimized, reducing the risk of airway injury. Tracheotomy through an in fl amed tracheal airway (i.e., croup) is also associated with an increased risk for long-term complications such as stenosis, and should be used sparingly if at all.
