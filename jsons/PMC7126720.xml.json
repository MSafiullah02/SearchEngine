There has been mounting recognition of the need to understand the balance between the immediate epidemiological benefits and longer-term evolutionary risks of interventions (Dieckmann et al., 2002, Gandon and Day, 2003, Elliot, 2003, Galvani, 2003). Recent work has revealed that vaccines that reduce pathogen replication or toxicity favor increased virulence, while vaccines that reduce the susceptibility of hosts to infection select for lower levels of virulence (Gandon et al., 2001, Gandon et al., 2003). Here we explore the effect of treatments that act by reducing the infectious period, such as curative therapy or case isolation measures, on the optimal virulence level of a pathogen.",

In the absence of within-host competition among pathogen strains (Nowak and May, 1994), the optimal virulence is determined by maximizing R0 subject to trade-offs between epidemiological parameters that are affected by pathogen virulence (May and Anderson, 1983, Chapin, 1926). However, the trade-off between disease-induced mortality (often taken as the definition of virulence) and pathogen transmissibility (assumed to increase with virulence) has been criticized as too simple (Ebert and Bull, 2003a). Recent work on virulence evolution has explored the importance of host population structure (Read and Keeling, 2003, Boots et al., 2004, Thrall and Burdon, 2003) and more complex interactions between epidemiological parameters (Andre et al., 2003, Ganusov and Antia, 2003).",

We review evidence that as virulence increases, the host may be harmed in four ways: (1) increased mortality, (2) slower recovery from infection, (3) reduced activity, i.e. fewer contacts with other individuals, and (4) increased probability of transmission given a contact. Furthermore, as increasing pathogen virulence worsens symptoms, rates of treatment or isolation of infectious hosts may increase (Tuckett, 1976, Twaddle, 1979). Thus, we consider evolution of pathogens with a wide range of disease manifestations, including non-lethal infectious diseases such as gonorrhea, and show under what circumstances curative therapy or case isolation may change the optimal virulence.",

When there is no control and u=0, Ru=R0; increasing values of u denote increasing treatment effort. We define the effective contact rate E as the rate at which a susceptible produces new infectives in a wholly susceptible population; for the simple model of disease transmission (Anderson and May, 1991, Bailey, 1975, Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) discussed in the Appendix, E=\u03b2cy, where \u03b2 is the transmission probability per contact and cy is the number of contacts per unit time; E is independent of treatment effort u in this model. The mean duration of infectivity D is given by (Anderson and May, 1991)(1)D=1\u03bc+\u03b4+\u03c1+\u03c6(u),where \u03bc is the background removal rate, \u03b4 is the disease-specific mortality rate, \u03c1 is the recovery rate, and \u03c6(u) the per-capita removal rate due to treatment or case isolation. We assume that \u03c6 always increases with the effort u and that \u03c6(0)=0. The reproduction number itself is then given simply by Ru(v)=E(v)D(u,v)\nAnderson and May (1991); this expresses the trade-off between the effective contact rate and the duration of transmission that determines the evolutionarily optimal level of virulence.",

            "text": "Greater pathogen loads within hosts may yield higher transmission probability per contact (\u201ctransmissibility\u201d), \u03b2, due to higher pathogen concentrations in bodily fluids or to more severe symptoms (Ewald, 1994, Levin, 1996). For example, coughing expels droplets which facilitate the spread of airborne infections such as influenza (Kilbourne, 1987) and tuberculosis (Hopewell and Bloom, 1994). Higher densities of pathogen should, all else being equal, result in a more virulent or harmful infection. Thus, a positive relationship between the transmissibility and virulence (Bremermann and Pickering, 1983, May and Anderson, 1983, Ewald, 1994, Lipsitch and Moxon, 1997) may occur in many host-pathogen systems, including Schistosoma mansoni (Davies et al., 2001), trypanosomes (Diffley et al., 1987), influenza (Van dergoot et al., 2003), myxoma virus in rabbits (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965, Anderson and May, 1991), Plasmodium species (Mackinnon and Read, 1999), canine parvovirus (Meunier et al., 1985) and HIV (Khouri et al., 1995, Jacquez et al., 1994, Riddler and Mellors, 1997, Katzenstein and Holodniy, 1995/1996, Katzenstein et al., 1996, Coombs et al., 1996, Craib et al., 1997, Fiore et al., 1997, Quinn et al., 2000). We treat the case where transmissibility is a concave-down increasing function of virulence, where necessarily 0\u2a7d\u03b2(v)\u2a7d1, with an independent parameter \u03b21 determining whether a completely avirulent strain (v=0) is still transmissible (as are many commensal microorganisms (Hooper and Gordon, 2001)); see Eq.

The treatment rate \u03c6 may also be related to the virulence, since treatment should be sought more often as symptoms become more severe (Tuckett, 1976, Twaddle, 1979). Severe symptoms may also increase control efforts for contact tracing, resulting in prophylactic treatment or quarantine, as occurred during the recent SARS outbreak (e.g. Lloyd-Smith et al. (2003)).

When \u03c6(u,v)=u(k+k\u2032v), the optimal virulence is given by(17)v*=(\u03bc+ku)v0\u03b40+k\u2032u.First note that when k\u2032=0 treatment is virulence-independent, and increasing the treatment rate increases the optimal virulence as in Fig. 4A. When k\u2032>0, the outcome depends on the relative magnitude of the virulence-dependent and -independent components of \u03c6 (i.e. k\u2032 versus k). When k\u2032>k\u03b40\u03bc, increasing the treatment rate will decrease the optimal virulence. When k\u2032<k\u03b40\u03bc, however, the treatment rate does not increase fast enough as virulence increases, and so increasing treatment leads to higher optimal virulence for the pathogen (i.e. the same qualitative behavior as the virulence-independent treatment case). Therefore, faster treatment of more virulent strains does not always exert sufficient selective pressure for increasing treatment effort to decrease the optimal virulence; the benefit to the pathogen of increased transmissibility can outweigh the cost of the higher treatment rate.",

Under the prevalent theory of virulence evolution, pathogen virulence evolves according to a trade-off between maximizing the number of new cases generated per unit time and maximizing the duration of infectivity. Treatment interventions reduce the value of duration-increasing strategies. Consequently, treatment shifts the optimal virulence toward values which produce larger numbers of new cases per unit time. This may result in increases or decreases of optimal virulence levels, depending on whether the virulence level that maximizes duration (independent of transmission) is below or above the virulence level that maximizes transmission (independent of duration). We applied this result to several special cases, extending trade-off models of previous authors, for the situation where treatment rates are independent of pathogen virulence. We found that when virulence is subject to a transmissibility-mortality trade-off, increasing treatment would lead to an increase in optimal virulence, but that in other cases optimal virulence is decreased (e.g. for the contact\u2013recovery trade-off) or unaffected (e.g. for the recovery\u2013mortality and contact-transmissibility trade-offs) by increasing treatment rates.",

This framework is appropriate for pathogens with greatly differing natural histories, including non-lethal diseases (e.g. gonorrhea) that are excluded by narrower definitions of virulence that pertain only to disease-induced death. Furthermore the validity of a simple trade-off between mortality and transmissibility has been challenged (Ebert and Bull, 2003a, Ebert and Bull, 2003b). We have reviewed the empirical evidence for more general trade-offs between epidemiological parameters (see also Day, 2003), and presented analysis of this general case. Our study is also the first, to our knowledge, to explicitly consider the link between virulence and host contact rates. The functional dependence of epidemiological parameters on virulence, however, is difficult to ascertain empirically. A recent study found dramatic differences in virulence evolution among models with markedly different formulations of transmission and host death, suggesting that detailed quantitative understanding of particular host\u2013parasite interactions is required to reliably predict virulence evolution (Ganusov and Antia, 2003). In this paper, we first presented general results applicable to arbitrary functional formulations, then explored examples based on plausible functional forms and special cases representing broad classes of disease natural histories.",
