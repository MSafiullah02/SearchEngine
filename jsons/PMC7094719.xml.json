            "text": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I remains a significant pathogen and many people (60 to 80% of the adult population) around the world have been reported to be infected with this virus [1]. HSV-1 tends to the nerves and establishes a long-term latent infection in the nervous system [2]. In certain people, recurrent infections occur in the trigeminal ganglia following periodic reactivation of latent virus [3], [4]. The virus causes a variety of diseases with a spectrum of severities, including cold sores (fever blisters), conjunctival and corneal lesions, pneumonia and meningoencephalitis in the immunocompromised individuals [1], [5], [6]. Antiviral drugs are able to reduce viral infection and are considered as efficacious treatments for HSV-1. However, virus resistance to these agents is increasing [7]. Several glycoproteins play a critical role in virus entry into mammalian cells and cell-to-cell spread, including gB, gD and gH/gL. The first stage to establish an infection is low-affinity and reversible attachment of the virus to the cell surface that is mediated by gB binding to surface heparin sulphate proteoglycan (HSPGs) [8]. In the next stage, gD interacts with one of the multiple potential entry receptors, nectin 1, 3-O-sulfated heparan sulphate (3-O HS) or herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM). Following gD attachment to one of its receptors, it undergoes conformational changes and a pH-independent fusion of an active multi-glycoprotein complex involving gB, gD, gH and gL will occur [9], [10].",

Among glycoproteins of HSV-1, gB has the most conserved entry glycoprotein that can act as fusion proteins. Four functional regions on gB have been identified by monoclonal antibodies. These regions include (i) initial 12 residues of the N-terminal part, (ii) residues 454 to 475, 391 to 410, and a less-defined zone within domain II, (iii) residues 697 to 725 of domain V and residues within domain I, and (iv) residues of domain IV nearby to domain III [12]. gB elicits a remarkable amount of neutralizing antibodies. Almost all neutralization activity is accounted for by epitopes in the N-terminal 298-amino acid portion of gB [13].",

In general, these libraries consist of either single chain fragment variable (scFv) or Fab fragments [14]. The smallest antibody fragments are scFv molecules (26\u201327 kDa) [15]. scFv antibodies have several advantages in terms of pharmacokinetic characteristics including lower retention in non-target tissues, higher penetration into target tissues, and lack of inducing human anti-mouse antibody responses [16], [17].

Monoclonal antibody H1817 that belonged to 6A subgroup bound functional region 4 (FR4) in domain VI of gB. FR4 containing the first 12 residues of the N terminus formed the epitope of MAb H1817. MAb H1817 had high neutralizing effect and reduced the plaque number on Vero cells by > 50% [24]. The antibody recognized a single peptide spanning residues 31 to 50 as previously reported. Pereira et al. mapped neutralizing epitopes in continuous regions of the amino-terminal half of gB [25]. Neutralizing antibodies H1396 [26] and H1397 [25] recognized residues 31\u201350. Precise peptide mapping of MAb revealed that the epitope for MAb H1817 was residues 31 to 43 and constituted FR4 [24].

For instance, specificity of scFvs against Helicobacter pylori\n[31], hepatitis B virus surface antigen [32], staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) [33], and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis surface proteins [34] have been certified using phage ELISA.

These results encourage further attempts (mainly through genetic engineering) to promote the development of scFv antibodies with preserved binding capacity but enhanced neutralizing effects. Also, future studies are warranted to test the neutralizing effect of the identified scFv antibodies in a purified and phage-free form to obtain a better assessment on their neutralizing effect and also test the dose-response association for the neutralizing effects of ScFvs. Optimized scFv antibodies with enhanced neutralizing effects could also be relevant for testing in clinical trials.",
