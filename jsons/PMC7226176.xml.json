            "text": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and most aggressive version of primary brain tumors, carries a really dismal prognosis [1,2]. Self-renewal and resistance to conventional therapy are the main features of malignant glioma and the location of the tumors in the most complex organ, the brain, is another demanding challenge for an effective tumor therapy. Neural tumor precursor cells, the so-called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), have been identified as the cell population, which owns an explicit resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy [3]. Thus, these cells are believed to be the driving force for the recurrence of the disease and, therefore, GSCs are a preferred target for therapeutic concepts [4]. A modicum of hope has become visible by the results of experimental studies and clinical trials using viruses with a tropism for glioma cells and GSCs. Historically, oncolytic virotherapy is a concept with a long history [5] that was first described back in 1912, when regression of cervical cancer was seen owing to the administration of the Louis Pasteur rabies vaccine [6]. In the last decades, the understanding of virus and tumor genetics has improved as a result of improved molecular biology, leading to the generation of recombinant, genetically modified virus candidates. Clinical trials have been completed using modified versions of herpes simplex virus [7,8,9,10,11,12], adenovirus [13,14], Newcastle disease virus [15], reovirus [16,17], parvovirus [18], and poliovirus [19]. Some of these studies demonstrated that a small subset of patients had a benefit from such virotherapy applications, but the statistical significance of these findings must be demonstrated in larger control trials [20].",

            "text": "A new discovery, with a high impact on the future aspects of glioma virotherapy, was that Zikavirus (ZIKV) showed a specific neurotropism for glial cells [21]. ZIKV is a new emerging mosquito-borne virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family [22]. In the Flaviviridae family, all members are enveloped viruses with two external, membranous proteins, the envelope E and the precursor of the membrane protein prM [23], both relevant for viral entry. In early 2015, abnormal rates of ZIKV infections were seen in Brazil, and in late 2015, an unexpected high number of newborns showed microcephaly, a disease where a baby\u2019s head is much smaller than expected. Altogether, the new emerging ZIKV was shown to be the cause of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), microcephaly, and other congenital brain abnormalities, proving its neurotropic phenotype [24]. An interesting finding was the oncolytic activity of ZIKV against GSCs [25]. A selective effect of ZIKV was observed for GSCs, causing loss of self-renewal and proliferation in glioblastoma organoids. In mice, ZIKV infection prolonged survival by slowing down tumor growth and showed only a weak side effect on normal neural cells [25]. Following these observations, the safety and efficiency of a live attenuated ZIKV candidate was investigated [26]. In an orthotopic glioma model, the live attenuated ZIKV reduced intracerebral tumor growth and prolonged animal survival. In these studies, a selective killing on GSCs within the tumor was observed [26]. Recent findings demonstrate that the entry of ZIKV into GSCs is supported by Integrin \u03b1v\u03b25 because viral entry can be specifically blocked by an \u03b1v\u03b25-specific antibody or by the cyclic peptide Cilengitide (cyclo-RGDfV-) [27], a peptide that is highly specific for binding to \u03b1v integrin [28,29,30]. Integrin \u03b1v as part of the integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 have been shown to play a role in a variety of tumors, particularly malignant gliomas. In high-grade gliomas, the expression level of \u03b1v\u03b23 is significantly higher not only in endothelial, but also in tumor cells compared with low-grade gliomas [31]. Additionally, \u03b1v as part of \u03b1v\u03b25 occurs frequently on cells from highly malignant gliomas [32]. Thus, the molecules used by ZIKV for viral entry are predominantly expressed in tumors, but can hardly be found in the tissue of the normal brain [33]. After ZIKV entry via its integrin receptors, the upregulation of micro-RNA-34c was observed in infected GSCs, suggested to be the reason for the reduction of GSC growth in an in vitro cell culture model using GSC spheres [34].",

Proteolytic cleavage of prM by the host cell protease furin causes the transformation of the non-infectious prME complex into the infectious ME-envelope. Viral entry is achieved by binding of the protein E to its receptors via its third domain followed by the membrane fusion process, initialized by the tip of the E protein called the fusion loop [35,36]. As explained above, the ZIKV possesses the characteristic to infect and to kill GSCs [25]. Therefore, the ZIKV prME envelopes are the preferred structures that should be used to construct a virus particle as a new candidate for virotherapy. All the ZIKV approaches that showed an oncolytic effect is utilizing a wild-type virus, but such an injection of active replicating ZIKV into the brain, even when attenuated, raises safety concerns. Our approach, therefore, was to combine the ZIKV specificity for glioma cells located in the prME envelope with the viral vector technology for the generation of lentiviral pseudotypes. Such pseudotypes are infectious, but replication incompetent particles, allowing only viral entry into cells\u2014a process described as single-round infection. Another aspect is the use of the viral vector as a Trojan horse for the delivery of genetic markers or anti-tumor active genes into the target cell.",

The advantage of a three-plasmid system is that the freed space in the gagpol deleted viral genome can be used for any kind of gene delivery into permissive cells. The three-plasmid system used for the generation of LENTIluc pseudotypes contains (i) the pME-Z1 plasmid for the expression of the ZIKV envelope proteins prM and E, (ii) the so-called packaging plasmid psPAX2 for the expression of the HIV-1 precursor\u2019s gag and gagpol, and (iii) the pLenti-luciferase-P2A-Neo plasmid coding for HIV-1 genomic RNA with the relevant elements for genome replication and the reporter gene for the expression of the firefly luciferase. For generation of the Z1-LENTIluc pseudotype, HEK293T cells grown in 24 wells were transfected with 2.6 \u00b5g pLenti-luciferase-P2A-Neo, 12.4 \u00b5g pME-Z1 (Zika prME) or pMD2.G (VSV-G), and 5 \u00b5g psPAX2 plasmid DNA. Cell culture supernatants were harvested on day 3 and used at a 1:5 dilution for infection of cells grown in 96 wells. All infections were carried out in triplicate with a standard deviation of the means \u226420%. As shown in Figure 4, the highest infection values were observed for Vero-B4 with 3.5 \u00d7 104 RLU/s.

Infection of 86HG39 cells was significantly lower with 5.8 \u00d7 103 RLU/s, but RLU values were clearly above the luciferase background of the infection assay. For comparison of the infection rates, cells were infected with pseudotype particles containing the VSV-G envelope, indicating that all three cell lines can be infected at similar rates by the VSV-G pseudotype and that Z1-LENTIluc infection is comparable to the VSV-G infection, with the exception of the Z1-LENTIluc/86HG39 combination. Z1-LENTIluc showed low infection rate on 86HG39 cells in contrast to the Z1-HIVluc particles produced by the two-plasmid system. For the generation of Z1-LENTIluc using the three-plasmid system, we used the most widely used packaging plasmid psPAX2. This plasmid expresses HIV-1 gag, gagpol, rev, and tat, but is nef deficient in contrast to pNL Luc AM, which is nef positive. This might explain the differences between Z1-HIVluc and Z1-LENTIluc infections of 86HG39 cells.",

Cell death will be induced owing to direct virus-induced cytotoxicity or indirect cytotoxic immune effector mechanisms [37]. Additionally, oncolytic viruses can be used to inhibit tumor growth by preventing angiogenesis, or through the expression of proteins triggering an anti-cancer immune response [38,39,40,41]. In general, each virus has a specific cellular tropism that determines which cells will become infected. For example, HIV-1 uses the CD4 receptor on T-helper cells, damaging the immune system in the most negative way, and finally leading to AIDS. However, the virus specificity for CD4 can be used in a positive way, which is the CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown of the CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors in CD4+ T-helper cells by a genetically engineered, replication incompetent retrovirus. Thus, autologous T-helper cells become resistant against HIV-1 [42]. Although such an application is restricted to the in vitro manipulation of T-helper cells, these experiments demonstrate that engineered retroviruses are excellent gene delivery systems and, therefore, provide important tools for therapeutic anti-tumor strategies [43].",

Moreover, pseudotypes between yellow fever and West Nile viruses were constructed to study antibody responses against yellow fever [47]. In addition, a pseudotype system for flaviviruses was developed based on a prME deficient Dengue-1 genome [48]. This system allows the study of neutralizing antibodies as it produces single-round infectious particles carrying a luciferase reporter gene.

The easiest way to get an envelope-pseudotype is the co-expression of the envelope together with an envelope deleted (env\u2212) viral vector, the so-called 2-plasmid system. An overview of the current status of envelope-pseudotype systems was given by Li et al., 2018 [49]. Using the two-plasmid, co-transfection system was sufficient for many different virus envelopes, but had not been conducted successfully for Flaviviridae including ZIKV [49]. Thus, ZIKV envelope-pseudotypes using the HIV-1 lentiviral packaging system, as described in our study, are new and not described in the literature up to now. In a first experiment, we used the HIV-1 viral packaging vector pNL4-3-R\u2212E\u2212, which works very effectively for env-pseudotypes of HIV [50], Ebola [51], SARS-CoV [52], MERS-CoV [53], and influenza [54,55]. Unfortunately, this vector was highly insufficient in prME-pseudotype production. As the vector was nef-depleted, we changed our strategy by using the nef+ viral vector pNL Luc AM, inspired by a publication describing a new function of HIV-1 nef [56], that is, its impact on cytoplasmic delivery of the HIV-1 genome. Using the nef+ vector, significant amounts of pseudotype particles were detected in cell culture supernatants. Interestingly, when the transfection of cells was optimized for cellular luciferase activity, the titers of infectious pseudotype particles were low. In contrast, pseudotype titers increased significantly when the amounts of plasmid DNA for transfection were enhanced. Thus, the highest titers for pseudotype particles were observed when luciferase activity in the transfected cells was low. This observation was a breakthrough in the production of the ZIKV prME-pseudotypes, allowing further pseudotype infection experiments under controlled and reproducible conditions.",

We used these cell lines to investigate if they were permissive for the ZIKV prME-pseudotypes. Compared with Vero-B4 cells, both glioma cell lines were efficiently infected by Z1-HIVluc. Vero cells were not used with the primary focus if their integrin expression was similar to glioma-derived cell lines. They are used as an infection control for the pseudotypes as these cells are widely used for isolation and cultivation of several viruses, including flaviviruses. Analysis of Vero cells revealed the expression of several integrins, especially \u03b1v\u03b23, but their expression level in comparison with glioblastoma cells is not known [59,60]. The infection experiments can be interpreted as a proof-of-principle: co-transfection of the prME expression vector together with pNL Luc AM (nef+) produced functional pseudotype particles and these particles showed infectivity for glioma cell lines at similar rates compared with Vero-B4 cells. Thus, the Z1-HIVluc pseudotype is a new tool to study the permissiveness of glioma cell lines as well as primary tumor cells as the next step.",

            "text": "On the basis of these findings, we also generated the prME-pseudotype Z1-LENTIluc using a three-plasmid system. The pseudotype core structure was produced by the HIV-1 precursor proteins gag and gagpol now expressed by the third packaging plasmid psPAX2. We used psPAX2 for packaging as it is the most widely used plasmid for generation of HIV-based pseudotypes. The lentiviral vector used in our application carries no gag, pol, or env genes and the freed space can now be principally used for a large variety of gene applications. We used a lentiviral vector that expressed the genes for firefly luciferase, as a reporter, and the gene for neomycin resistance. Together with the pME-Z1 plasmid, infectious particles were obtained and infection of Vero-B4, U87, and 86HG39 cells was observed. Using the three-plasmid system, infection rates were generally lower because three plasmids instead of two plasmids have to find their way into the target cells. Interestingly, infection of 86HG39 cells with Z1-LENTIluc was lower compared with Z1-HIVluc or U87 cells. This might be because psPAX2 is rev+ and tat+, but lacks the expression of the nef gene. The difference in infectivity of Z1-LENTIluc also indicates that nef might play a role in viral entry related to the origin of the glioma cell lines. Probably because receptor binding and membrane fusion is started by ZIKV protein E, but most importantly, HIV-1 capsid cytoplasmic delivery is, in some cases, nef dependent [56]. However, using the three-plasmid system, the lentiviral vector was transmitted successfully into glioma cells. An optimized packaging system for Z1-LENTIluc would probably be a single plasmid for the expression of gag, gagpol, rev, tat, nef, all together with prME. Another option would be to establish a stable cell line expressing all these proteins necessary for particle formation.",
