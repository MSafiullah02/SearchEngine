Most flu-like syndromes are due to Rhinoviruses or Coronaviruses which are not associated with significant mortality and for which the vaccine does not provide any protection. People should be advised that the influenza vaccine will not prevent colds and most flu-like symptoms, but their risk of getting pneumonia or dying is reduced. The best predictors for flu vaccination are previous vaccinations and advice from general practitioners [9, 10, 111.",

Randomised controlled trials have shown that immunisation is effective and meta-analyses of flu vaccination have shown a reduction in morbidity, hospitalisation and mortality. For example, pooled estimates of efficacy based on 20 cohort studies have shown that vaccination reduces respiratory illness by 56%, pneumonia by 53%, hospitalisation by 48% and mortality by 68% 161. Hospitalisation costs are also reduced by vaccination which is certainly cost-effective [7].",
