            "text": "Nosocomial infection, that is, infection in healthcare facilities, is health-threatening for hospitalized patients and caregivers (Gastmeier et al., 2005, Grundmann and Hellriegel, 2006). Pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are mainly nosocomial in the sense that the majority of cases are hospital-related (Salgado et al., 2003, Cooper et al., 2004). In addition, as observed in recent cases of influenza (CDR weekly, 2005) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Ho et al., 2003, Leung et al., 2004, Svoboda et al., 2004), nosocomial infection serves as an initiator or a booster of epidemic outbreaks at urban community and world-wide levels. In accordance, mathematical models specialized in nosocomial infections and their controls have been developed, with intensive emphases on antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Lipsitch et al., 2000, Pelupessy et al., 2002, Forrester and Pettitt, 2005, Bootsma et al., 2006, Boldin et al., 2007) and intensive care units (Pelupessy et al., 2002, Perencevich et al., 2004, Forrester and Pettitt, 2005, Boldin et al., 2007). Quantitative statistical models for nosocomial infection have also been reported (Cooper and Lipsitch, 2004, Forrester and Pettitt, 2005, Forrester et al., 2007).",

There have been many modeling reports on disease spreading on complex social networks (Meyers et al., 2003, Meyers et al., 2005, Christley et al., 2005, Keeling and Eames, 2005, Pourbohloul et al., 2005, Watts et al., 2005, Colizza et al., 2006, Green et al., 2006, Riley, 2007, Volz and Meyers, 2007). A central theoretical finding is that hubs, namely, those who have contacts to relatively many others, communicate and enhance disease transmission. Diseases spread to a great extent with larger probability on heterogeneous networks such as scale-free networks in which the number of contacts that each individual maintains is highly heterogeneous (Hethcote and Yorke, 1984, Anderson et al., 1986, Albert et al., 2000, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001). Such heterogeneous networks are operative in sexually transmitted diseases (Liljeros et al., 2001) and computer viruses (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001).",

First, social networks of healthcare facilities may be structured differently from networks of urban communities or the whole world. In terms of size, a hospital is typically much smaller than an urban community. In terms of microscopic structure, contact patterns in a hospital are regulated by hierarchy defined by departments, wards, and rooms. To our knowledge, efficient containment strategies for social networks with such modular structure have not been established. Second, a healthcare facility is composed of individuals of distinct roles, such as patients, visitors, and healthcare workers. Healthcare workers can be subdivided into different classes, such as nurses and medical doctors. Susceptibility, mortality, infectiousness, and many other factors that affect how diseases spread depend on the type of individuals. For example, junior doctors may visit more wards than nurses do, possibly carrying pathogens from ward to ward (CDR weekly, 2005). Patients may be less active but likely have larger case fatality (i.e. fraction of death among infected individuals) than healthcare workers (Leung et al., 2004, Forrester and Pettitt, 2005). In urban community social networks, the role of different types of individuals in disease propagation may not be so clear-cut.",

In this work, we model nosocomial infection in social networks based on observations of contact frequency in a hospital in Tokyo. We simulate stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic dynamics on these networks and evaluate effectiveness of intervention and vaccination protocols. We show that medical doctors that move between wards, but not patients or nurses each of whom is attached to a single ward, are principal vectors (i.e. transmitters) of pathogens. In accordance, we show that reallocating patients to medical doctors reduces epidemic spreading to a larger extent than preparing single rooms to isolate patients. We also show that the vaccination protocols that principally target healthcare workers, particularly medical doctors, located in key positions determined by network analysis are more effective than those focusing on patients or on simply most connected individuals.",

Another minor difference is that some resident doctors occupy very different parts of the two networks because they change the department every month.

The clustering coefficient, which counts the abundance of local connectivity by the density of triangles normalized between 0 and 1, C=0.534. A relatively small value of L and a large value of C of this network implies the small-world property (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). Although the hospital network has a considerably smaller L than spatially structured networks such as the square lattice (a regular two-dimensional network), it is not perfectly mixed. If we rewire the edges randomly with the degree (number of edges that an individual has) of each individual fixed, L even decreases to 2.97 and clustering is lost (C=0.0251). This behavior of L and C upon random rewiring of edges is similar to that for the Watts\u2013Strogatz network model (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). The path length L of the original network is larger than the randomized network because of some localization of individuals. First, patients are connected to each other within one room only. Therefore, intraroom edges are dense relative to interroom edges. Second, each patient and nurse is attached to a single ward and only connected to patients and nurses inside that ward; only medical doctors link different wards. Therefore, intraward edges are dense relative to interward edges. Third, doctors are localized in the sense that doctors visit only the wards with patients from their own department and that doctors in the same team have correlated contact patterns and mutual connections. The entire network is composed of relatively dense subnetworks (also called communities or network modules in network literature, e.g. Girvan and Newman, 2002, Palla et al., 2005) that are loosely interlinked in a hierarchical manner.",

The average of the distribution shown as each vertical cross section, i.e. for each value of \u03bb, corresponds to the solid line in Fig. 3a. Above a threshold infection rate, the distribution has two masses. One thin mass is concentrated around zero and indicates that, despite a large infection rate, the epidemic can quickly decline to extinction owing to demographic stochasticity of state I individuals (i.e. minor epidemic). The other mass is centered around a positive value of the final size and corresponds to the major epidemic. Precisely speaking, the major epidemic consists of two peaks. This is because one ward, which is devoted to the psychiatry department, has 42 (of 605) individuals and is connected to the rest of the network via only two junior doctors. These doctors examine patients from departments to which they previously belonged, in addition to patients from the psychiatry department. Suppose that the disease starts from the index case in this ward. Disease must pass through the narrow channel composed of the two doctors to spread to the rest of the population. This event occurs with a somewhat low probability even for very large infection rates. This causes the lower peak of the upper mass around 0.9 in Fig. 3b, which is eminent for \u03bb\u2a7e0.8. We confirmed that a two-mass distribution, possibly with subdivisions of each mass reflecting modular structure of the network, underlies each of the following numerical results. In addition, whereas an epidemic whose final size is near the mean value rarely occurs because of the two-mass distribution shown in Fig. 3b, a larger mean final size indicates a larger probability of major epidemic. Therefore we will show only the mean values of the final size in later figures.",

To exclude this possibility, we examine the network in which the Pt\u2013Dr and Ns\u2013Dr edges are duplicated through the intervention. With this modification, doctor Dr1 and nurse Ns1 in Fig. 4a, for example, is connected by two edges. Equivalently, we increase the transmission rate of this single edge twofold to account for the doubled contact rate between them, which comes from the fact that Dr1 and Ns1 examine twice patients together (two patients after the intervention versus one patient before the intervention). The edge duplication is also done for a Pt\u2013Dr edge whenever the number of doctors that examine the patient on this edge decreases as a result of intervention. Consequently, the number of Pt\u2013Dr edges and that of Ns\u2013Dr edges return to those of the original network. This implies that the quality of the medical service that we measure by the number of Pt\u2013Ns and Pt\u2013Dr edges does not degrade due to the intervention. The number of edges in total after this modified intervention 1 is 3016, which is close to the number for the original network (i.e. 3046 edges; also see Table 1).",

As an example, suppose that Pt1 in Fig. 4b is examined by Dr1 for twice as long after the intervention than in the pre-intervention situation where Pt1 is examined by two doctors. Accordingly, we duplicate the edge between Pt1 and Dr1. In addition, we compensate the contact rate, or the number of edges, between nurses and doctors by duplicating the corresponding Ns\u2013Dr edges, as in intervention 1. Taking the edge duplication into account, the numbers of Pt\u2013Dr and Ns\u2013Dr edges, as well as those of Pt\u2013Pt, Pt\u2013Ns, and Ns\u2013Ns edges, are preserved. A byproduct of this modification is that the service quality assessed by the amount of the Pt\u2013Ns and Pt\u2013Dr edges is restored. The total number of edges after modified intervention 2 is 3004 (see Table 1 for the number of each type of edges), which is close to 3046, the number for the original network. The persisting reduction in the number of edges comes from that of Dr\u2013Dr edges.

This is because patients are largely confined to their rooms and Pt\u2013Pt edges do not play an important role in epidemics on a large scale. For a very large infection rate, intervention 3 is better than intervention 1. However, the final size and the mortality for intervention 3 are still larger than those for intervention 2. For an extremely large infection rate for which more than two-thirds of the population becomes infected, intervention 3 is more efficient at control than intervention 2. Our claim that introducing single rooms may be ineffective is consistent with an observation analysis (Cepeda et al., 2005) and a modeling study (Bootsma et al., 2006) of MRSA.",

In a well-mixed network, the degree is correlated well with most other centrality measures so that hubs are central in most senses. However, the observed hospital network is not entirely well-mixed. As an example, we consider the betweenness centrality, which is a count of how often an individual mediates the communication between arbitrarily chosen pairs of individuals along the shortest paths (Freeman, 1979). Fig. 7\n, which compares the degree and the betweenness centrality of each individual in the hospital, indicates that the most connected individuals are not necessarily those with the greatest betweenness centrality values.",

The degree-based vaccination is superceded by the betweenness-based vaccination for a wide range of \u03bb, agreeing with the previous modeling work by Holme et al. (2002). The betweenness-based vaccination is effective because interward communication is inhibited after vaccination of key individuals. These key individuals are mostly medical doctors and sometimes nurses. In our simulations, the two doctors who connect the nearly isolated ward to the remainder of the network, whom we mentioned in Section 3.2, have the largest and the third largest betweenness centrality values. These doctors are actually vaccinated in the betweenness-based protocol. A disease does not enter a subnetwork if the entire network is fragmented after removing such key individuals. Even if the network is not fragmented after vaccination, a chain of transmission has to make detours, which makes disease spreading less likely. This is presumably because important shortcuts owned by central individuals have been cut out.",

For each of the centrality measures examined (closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, power centrality, information centrality, and random-walk centrality; see Junker et al., 2006, for a list of centrality measures), the overall tendency that the class-mixed and doctor-first vaccinations are superior to the nurse-first vaccination, which supercedes the patient-first vaccination, is reproduced (not shown). Betweenness-type centrality measures such as the random-walk centrality turn out to be more effective at reducing epidemics than others. Whether the class-mixed strategy is superior to the doctor-based strategy depends on the centrality measure and whether the weekday network or the weekend network is used.",

Both the intervention and vaccination results suggest that medical doctors that link different wards are main spreaders of nosocomial pathogens. To rewire the Pt\u2013Dr relationship (interventions 1 and 2; particularly, intervention 2) is more efficient than suppressing Pt\u2013Pt communication (intervention 3). Note that, in spite of the relative ineffectiveness of intervention 3, it involves construction of single rooms, which presumably costs more than interventions 1 and 2, and may result in reduction in the hospital admission capacity. Vaccinating doctors first suppresses epidemics more than vaccinating patients or nurses first. Importantly, doctor-centered containment strategies are more effective than patient-centered ones at reducing not only the final size of the entire population but also that of the patients.",

Instead, our observed networks in the hospital have modular and hierarchical structure regulated by wards, rooms, teams of medical doctors, and departments. Different modules are bridged by healthcare workers, especially by medical doctors. Therefore, the common result that scale-free networks boost epidemics owing to hubs, which hold for well-mixed networks with right-skewed degree distributions (Hethcote and Yorke, 1984, Anderson et al., 1986, Albert et al., 2000, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001, Meyers et al., 2003, Meyers et al., 2005, Christley et al., 2005), seems to be rather irrelevant to the current situation, as has been pointed out for other situations (Holme et al., 2002, Watts et al., 2005, Green et al., 2006, Ichinomiya, 2007). For our networks, we have shown that the vaccination protocols based on the betweenness centrality, which target individuals that tend to maintain shortcuts, are more effective than that based on the degree.

Therefore, vaccinating healthcare workers may be more effective than vaccinating patients in preventing nosocomial infection (Carman et al., 2000, Meyers et al., 2003). These results are consistent with ours. We have further distinguished roles of different classes of healthcare workers, namely, medical doctors and nurses, which was ignored in an observation study of nosocomial infection in which only patients were considered (Liljeros et al., 2007). We also examined the effects of individuality in terms of their position in the networks. We suggest that healthcare workers, doctors in particular, with large betweenness centrality values are of high mobidity in nosocomial infection. Because the betweenness centrality is an ad hoc measure for our purpose, there may be alternative measures more directly related to mobidity of individuals.",

An alternative strategy is to abandon heterogeneous contact rates at the level of individuals and employ a population-based approach in which distributions of contact rates are approximated using discrete population groups such as age groups (Wallinga et al., 2006). However, the use of global information can be practical in the nosocomial setting because healthcare facilities are limited in size.

Related to this, we have assumed frequency-dependent transmission in which the infection rate is proportional to the number of edges involved.

Nosocomial pathogens such as MRSA and VRE cause asymptomatic infection in which carriers, of which there are many types, do not necessarily infect others. In the SIR model, incubation periods are ignored and all the individuals are as susceptible and infectious as others at a common infection rate. However, given the robustness of our results against heterogeneous infection rates for different individuals shown in Section 3.3.4, we expect that our finding is extended to more general situations of disease spreading. Modeling dynamics of particular nosocomial pathogens is an important future problem.",
