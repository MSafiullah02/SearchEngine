            "text": "Human rhinoviruses are highly prevalent respiratory picornaviruses of the Enterovirus genus. They display a single stranded positive sense RNA genome of approximately 7200 nucleotides encoding a single polyprotein which is cleaved by viral proteases into 11 individual proteins. Human rhinoviruses are amongst the most frequent causes of upper respiratory tract infections, and are significantly associated with several lower respiratory tract infections including acute wheezing, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, and cause about one half of asthma exacerbations (Busse et al., 2010). One hundred classical serotypes have been defined by 20-fold or greater decrease in antigen cross-reactivity and form two genetically distinct species, A and B. There has recently been a renewed interest in rhinoviruses following the discovery of the highly prevalent and diverse species C group, using novel molecular-based approaches (McErlean et al., 2007, Briese et al., 2008, Kiang et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2007, Lau et al., 2007). Species B viruses are generally considered to be rare, with an average prevalence rate of around 7% of total HRV strains (Renwick et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2009a). Several studies suggest that species C viruses are a major cause of wheezing and exacerbation of asthma in children, and may have different clinical outcomes to other species [Lau et al., 2007, Miller et al., 2009b), however, other studies find no significant differences (Piotrowska et al., 2009, McCulloch et al., 2014).",

            "text": "The recent whole-genome sequencing of all species A and B, and several species C prototype strains provides a very useful framework for the genetic analysis and classification of clinical specimens, from partial or whole sequences (Palmenberg et al., 2009). Recently, new criteria have been proposed for the classification of species C viruses, which has simplified the identification of novel genotypes, or \u201cgenetic types.\u201d These criteria classify 33 genetic types, and 28 provisional types which require confirmation by additional VP1 gene sequencing (Simmonds et al., 2010). Within A and B species, there is generally a strong adherence to phylogenetic positioning (branching order) between the different structural protein genes, with a few exceptions (Savolainen et al., 2004, McIntyre et al., 2010). Species C viruses cluster in two phylogenetic groups on the 5\u2019 untranslated region (5UTR), one with species A (designated in some studies as Ca) and the other as a separate C cluster (designated Cc) (Palmenberg et al., 2010, Huang et al., 2009). There is a consensus view that partial genome sequencing of at least two regions (VP4/2, VP1 or 3CD genes) of the HRV genome is sufficient for genetic type classification based on nucleotide homology (McIntyre et al., 2010, Arden and Mackay, 2010). Several recent studies support classification guidelines based on pairwise nucleotide homology distance thresholds, based on studies across the genome, and these data are supported by serotypical distinctions in A and B species. The proposed inter-serotype pairwise nucleotide divergence threshold for A and B species is 13% in the VP1 gene and 10% in the VP4/2 gene (Simmonds et al., 2010, McIntyre et al., 2010, McIntyre et al., 2013, Savolainen et al., 2002a, Wisdom et al., 2009a). These criteria also apply to the inter-genotype distance for species C viruses, which cannot be classified by serology due to their inability to grow in tissue culture (Simmonds et al., 2010, McIntyre et al., 2010). As a consequence, novel HRV strains were described in the past few years, particularly novel species C viruses (Briese et al., 2008, Renwick et al., 2007, Miller et al., 2009b, McIntyre et al., 2010, Wisdom et al., 2009b, Kistler et al., 2007). Potentially novel species A viruses are rarely reported, however, recently the strain A101 strain has been observed in several studies worldwide (Rathe et al., 2009).",

Amplification was performed with the Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit, as described previously (Huang et al., 2009). For VP1 amplification, RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamer primers (Promega, United Kingdom) using the superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was then conducted using Gotaq polymerase (Promega), and species-specific primers which have been previously described (Supplementary Table 1) (Tapparel et al., 2009).

A touch-down program (annealing temp of 55\u20131 \u00b0C per cycle for 10 cycles, then 30 cycles at 45 \u00b0C) was used for both primary and nested PCRs. DNA products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Products were ligated into TOPO-TA vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). At least two plasmids were sequenced for each clinical sample. At least two recombinant clones were sequenced on an ABI3730 XL automatic DNA sequencer by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea).",

RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal (NPS) samples, and amplified by real time PCR to detect the presence of 18 viruses, as described in previous studies (Buecher et al., 2010). From 4170 patient samples, 1105 samples tested positive for one or more virus. HRV was detected in 455 samples, representing the most frequently detected virus (10.9% of all patients, and 41.2% of patients positive for viral detections), consistent with evidence that rhinoviruses are usually highly prevalent (Miller et al., 2009a, Huang et al., 2009, Buecher et al., 2010, Follin et al., 2009, Loens et al., 2006, Vong et al., 2013, Guerrier et al., 2013). Two hundred sixty-one of these patients were male, 194 female. Two hundred thirty-seven patients were under the age of 2 years (52%), with 273 (60%) under the age of 5, and 80 patients over the age of 50 (17.6%). As previously reported, ALRI in general and HRV infections in particular were observed throughout the year, without clear seasonality (Guerrier et al., 2013). In addition to typical symptoms of ALRI recorded for all patients, supplementary comprehensive clinical data was available from 94 patients, which allowed us report on typical symptoms associated with disease (Table 1\n), and also to form a case definition to identify severe rhinoviral infection. This definition included the following criteria; no bacterial infection (sputum-negative) or viral co-infection. For children >5 years, or adults, was the inclusion of at least two of the following; a systolic blood pressure of \u2a7d90 mmHg, a cardiac frequency of \u2a7e120 bpm, a respiratory rate of \u2a7e30/mn, saturation of \u2a7d93%, or a temperature of \u2a7d35 \u00b0C or \u2a7e40 \u00b0C. The criteria for children \u2a7d5 years was a respiratory rate of either \u2a7e60/mn (aged < 2 months), \u2a7e50/mn (aged between 2 and 12 months), \u2a7e40/mn (aged between 1 and 5 years), oxygen saturation of <93%, a cardiac frequency of >180 bpm (aged <1 year), or >140 bpm (aged between 1 and 5 years), and signs of severe respiratory distress.

Viruses which were defined as clinically severe are highlighted in Table 3. Sixteen viruses in species A displayed pairwise distances at nucleic acid level to the closest relative ranging from 10% to 19.9%. With respect to species B, 10 viruses out of 11 displayed pairwise distances ranging from 15.8% to 18.8%. The only virus from species C showing a VP4/2 pairwise distance above the 10% threshold to the closest relative was R005 (29.1%) which was identified as a novel type based on VP1 sequence distances. Interestingly, the VP4/2 closest relative, i.e. HRV-C15, was different than the VP1 closest relative, i.e. HRV-C23. However, when considering the pairwise distances at the protein level, a different feature was seen. Several viruses for which the nucleotide pairwise distance with the closest relative was clearly above the 10% threshold displayed a protein sequence 100% identical to that of the same closest virus. Interestingly, several of these putative new types based on nucleotide distance, ,displayed amino-acid distances lower than sample K169.2 for which the nucleotide distance was below the 10% threshold (i.e. 8.5%). For instance, sample K169.2 which cannot be considered a new genotype with 8.5% nucleotidic distance displayed a protein distance of 1.7% whereas sample K606, considered a putative new genotype with 18.8% nucleotidic distance showed a protein distance of only 0.8%. Protein distances for all the 10 putative new species B genotypes ranged from 0.8% to 3.3%. Protein distances for putative new species A genotypes ranged from 0% to 5.2% with 15 viruses out of 16 displaying protein distances below 3%.

The ratio of observed transition (mutation from a purine nucleotide to another or a pyrimidine nucleotide to another) versus transversion (mutation for a purine nucleotide to pyrimidine one or from a pyrimidine nucleotide to purine one) was calculated as an indicator of genome saturation. Data are summarised in Supplementary Table 2. The ratio ranged from 0.714 to 1.086 for the coding sequences depending on the gene and virus species. Owing to the presence of indels in the VP1 sequences, calculation was done on indel-free segments. For the 5\u2019UTR, the transition/transversion ratio was 0.515. For reference, the transition/transversion ratio was calculated for the gene E of the dengue DENV-1 virus (Duong et al., 2013) with a value of 14.49. The rate of polymorphic sites (S) ranged from 44.3% to 71.3 5% depending on the sequence while \u0398 ranged from 42.8 to 101.8. The DENV-1 E gene used as a reference displayed a rate of polymorphic sites of 12.7% and a \u0398 value of 40.1. The ratio between parsimony informative sites (Pa) and singletons (Si) was strongly biased towards the former with a rate of Pa ranging from 88.5% to 96.1% for the coding regions while it was 84.3% for the 5\u2019UTR. For reference, the values of Pa and Si were very close for the DENV-1 gene E, although higher for Si, with rates of 48.7% and 51.3%, respectively. A strong bias was also observed in the rate of synonymous replacement (Ns) which ranged from 86.2% to 96.4%, the rate for the DENV-1 E gene being in the same range with 84.9%. Accordingly, a very low value of the Ka/Ks was observed for all sequences. No bias was observed on the individual rate of A, T, G and C bases.",

Rhinoviruses are frequently concurrently detected with other respiratory viruses due to their high circulation in the community. However, some studies have proposed that despite the frequency of co-detections, rhinoviruses are statistically the least likely to be involved in coinfection and may actually reduce the probability of another virus infecting the host (Duong et al., 2013). HRV/HRV co-detections have occasionally been reported (Lee et al., 2007, Renwick et al., 2007, Huang et al., 2009), although, interestingly no co-detections from the same species have been reported. In this work we report one HRV/HRV co-detection, and significantly both viruses detected from one patient were species A (HRV78 and HRV81). The frequency of HRV co-detections is difficult to assess given that often only a few clones are sequenced and therefore if one virus is present in a lesser proportion than the other, it might not be detected. In this work we analysed 455 viruses and we found out that 35 only out of these 455 were co-detected with other viruses (7.7% of total). This percentage is even lower than that reported in previous studies, i.e. 23% of total [40] which were concluding that rhinoviruses were statistically the least likely respiratory virus to be involved in co-infection (Greer et al., 2009). This further highlights the independent role of rhinoviruses as major aetiological contributors to severe respiratory disease.",

A recent study sequenced the entire genome of a virus designated A101, which has a nucleotide identity across the genome of only 76.6% with the nearest species A virus (HRV-53) (Rathe et al., 2009). Another study conducted in Thailand found species A to be the most common species detected regardless of age groups (Fry et al., 2011). Following the standards developed by McIntyre et al. (2013) five novel genotypes were identified in this work with respect to the VP1 gene. Two viruses from species A (i.e. D386 and K590), two viruses from species B (i.e. K606 and P128) and one virus from species C (i.e. R005). The divergence at the nucleic acid level was high enough above the threshold set by McIntyre et al. (2013) to consider these viruses actual new genotypes. This conclusion is strongly supported for three viruses, i.e. D386, P128 and R005, by the high divergence also observed at the protein level. This protein divergence was however very limited for the last two VP1 variants (i.e. K606 and K590). A similar situation is encountered when using VP4/2 as a target region for genotyping. Most of the putative variants identified on nucleotide distance display a very limited divergence with the closest relative at protein level (less than 3%) and in several cases there is a perfect identity. The best example found in this work is perhaps the novel VP1 type, R005, which displays the highest divergence to the closest relative of all novel types based on the VP1 gene and protein sequences and the highest divergence to the closest relative on the VP4/2 gene sequence but 100% VP4/2 protein sequence identity. In addition, the closest relative to R005 is not the same according to VP1 or VP4/2.",

It is therefore difficult when in presence of conflicting nucleic-acid and amino-acid distance data to formally assign these viruses to a novel type. We suggest that the typology standards developed by McIntyre et al. (2013) should be completed with protein thresholds into order to assign unambiguously these conflicting detections to specific types.",

This is especially true for the VP1 gene which displays indels. However, the relative position of the detected viruses within each taxon and their phylogeny cannot be established. Both the high rate of polymorphism and level of saturation observed can easily result in the occurrence of reverse mutations and blurred phylogeny. The clear genetic clustering and the high negative selective pressure observed on both the VP1 and VP4/2 genes suggest that the three species described might correspond to virus groups having undergone independent evolution and specialisation.",
