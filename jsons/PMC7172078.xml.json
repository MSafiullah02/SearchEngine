The high variability of age and sex differences in morbidity and mortality rates from emerging zoonotic viruses, such as new coronaviruses and influenza viruses, can provide important indices of populations at highest risk of infection and death, and insights into potential mechanisms for transmission of these viruses to human beings, and between people. This information, in turn, can help to develop public health strategies for the most efficient and effective use of scarce diagnostic, medical care, and treatment resources.",
