Besides socio-demographic indicators, prior knowledge also influences the development of health literacy skills. Then health literacy has direct effect on health behavior, meanwhile, as a mediator between prior knowledge and health behavior. Finally, health behavior influences health status.",

In this study, oral literacy was tested though six questions from three pieces of audio or video.

There was no significant difference between genders and ethnic groups when it came to measurements of health literacy. The main reason is that the awareness of the public on the prevention of infectious respiratory disease has been greatly increased with various intervention activities being conducted after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes (SARS) in 2003 and the outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in 2006 in China. There was, however, a significant difference between the unmarried and married group, but the difference is explainable by age differences. In addition, there was a significant difference in health literacy across three categories of occupation. Highest health literacy scores were seen among students, scientific and technical workers, teachers and doctors. Office workers, service providers, general workers and other workers scored lower, while farmers and retired people scored lower still. Due to the strong relationship between education level and subsequent occupation, the effect of occupation on health literacy reflected the effect of education on health literacy in a similar fashion.

This indicates how important education is for the promotion of health literacy. Education has the same strong effect on prior knowledge, and a further indirect effect on health literacy though prior knowledge. As an important social source of information, the effect of higher education levels on health literacy has been demonstrated in many studies [6,16].

Through careful measurement, we find that prior knowledge and health literacy tend to increase slightly among younger age groups, but then decrease significantly with age among the older age groups. Therefore, targeting the under-30 age group for the popularization and publicity of health literacy program \u2013 when perception and behavior form and develop stably \u2013 can promote their health skills and knowledge, bringing them lifetime benefits. For those aged over 30, health communication and health education must be consolidated due to the downward trend of knowledge and health literacy with aging. Conversely, the study found older age groups\u2019 health status was better than that of the younger groups, with the 30\u201339 age group as the dividing point. This finding is contrary to what other studies have measured. The main reason for this is that the health status category was only concerned with the frequency an individual got a cold and the severity of such sicknesses because it is relatively easier and more feasible to measure the frequency of catching a cold and its severity than other kinds of infectious respiratory diseases. As we know, older people have often developed stronger resistance to these illnesses than younger people. For example, Kumar\u2019s review of H1N1 flu shows that the virus is causing critical illnesses mostly in young adults. The researchers concluded that H1N1 (swine flu) primarily affects young adults who are in relatively good health and free of underlying illnesses [27].",

However, more researchers view conceptual knowledge or prior knowledge as a resource or a moderator that a person has, which facilitates health literacy, but does not in itself constitute health literacy [21-23,28]. This study finds that prior knowledge has a strong direct effect on health literacy. That is to say that a person with more health knowledge is better able to obtain, comprehend and use health information.",

Prior knowledge\u2019s effect on health behavior stands to reason, for example in the KAP model [29]. Health behavior and health status are interactional. In Baker\u2019s model, health literacy is one of many factors that lead to the acquisition of new knowledge, more positive attitudes, greater self-efficacy, positive health behaviors, and better health outcomes [20]. In von Wagner\u2019s model, health outcomes depend on a range of mediating processes, most obviously actions to promote health, prevent disease, or comply with diagnosis and treatment, which the author calls health actions [22]. In Paasche-Orlow and Wolf\u2019s 2007 model, they proposed causal pathways between limited health literacy and health outcomes [21]. Their models distinguish three different types of health actions that mediate the impact of health literacy on health: access to and utilization of health care, patient\u2013provider interaction, and self-care. In this study, health behavior mainly focused on self-care and utilization of health care, while health status reflected health outcome. However, health behavior and health status did not show a good relationship. The measurement of health status in this study was conditioned to respiratory infection due to the restriction of the project scope. It is obvious that respiratory infections are influenced by many things, not only individual behavior, but also a variety of biological and social factors. Therefore, the relationship between health behavior and health outcomes, and the effect of health literacy on health outcomes though health behavior need further study to validate.",

Increased staffing of health educators in clinical settings and community interventions would also help increase health literacy. We would like to develop an intervention that demonstrates how health literacy can be addressed to target community outcomes as opposed to individual outcomes.
