In addition, most HIV-infected women in Africa, Asia, and South America breast-feed their infants. This additional means by which infants can possibly become infected complicates assessment of factors contributing to transmission. In Africa, the percentage of postnatal transmission is approximately 50Y0.~~ Nevertheless, the morbidity and mortality caused by formula feeding in countries where potable water is a premium and safe infant formula is not readily available seem to be greater than the risk of acquiring HIV-1 from breast milk.

Following selection by receptors on high endothelial venules, these infected cells then migrate home to the lamina propria, whereby in situ hybridization isolated HIV-infected cells can be identified (Fig. 1 ). Most evidence 'supports the hypothesis that deterioration of mucosal immune function results in bacterial overgrowth; increased production of bacterial products, such as endotoxin; activation of mucosal lymphocytes with increased cytokine production; and probable interaction between immunoregulatory elements and epithelial cell function (Fig. 2) . Although the reasons for early development of lactose intolerance and malabsorption are not known, substances involved in immune regulation also may interact with intestinal epithe-lial cells, resulting in dysfunction. HIV also may have a role in the genesis of intestinal dysfunction, but data are not available. Clearly, enteric infections begin to occur at the time when immune function is deteriorating (Fig. 3) .

Because of the availability of safe formula in North America and Europe, the relationship between maternal health and infant survival is not as obvious.

Stomatitis caused by 2',3'-dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (ddC), herpes simplex or Candida is treatable if the diagnosis is established. When oral lesions are present, coexistent esophagitis should be suspected. In contrast, if the mouth is free of lesions, esophagitis cannot be ruled out. Candida and cytomegalovirus are the most common infectious agents causing esophagitis. Dysphagia and odynophagia in HIV-infected children are more commonly associated with Candida than with cytomegalovirus. Children who are taking H, antagonists seem to be at increased risk for developing Candida esophagitis. Medications, such as zidovudine, have been reported to cause esophageal ulceration if, when swallowed, they do not reach the stomach.6 Treatment for specific causes of oral or esophageal lesions is summarized in Table 3 . Although enteric pathogens are frequently identified as the cause the incidence of of diarrhea and weight loss in HIV-infected enteric infection in HIV-infected children seems to be lower,4O and the relationship between diarrhea, enteric pathogens, and growth retardation is not as clearly understood. In Figure 4 , the interrelationship between malabsorption, malnutrition, immune deficiency, and enteric infection is depicted. Enteric infection results in intestinal injury and malabsorption, which, if not compensated by additional nutrient support, results in nutritional deficiency. The development of malnutrition causes immune deficiency, which is characterized by a defect in T-cell function that is similar to the defect caused by HIV disease. Defective T-cell function results in increased susceptibility to enteric infection, and the circle is completed. HIV can interact at any of the stages of this cycle. In theory, intestinal absorption can be altered by modifying enterocyte function through immune modulators. By increasing apoptosis, HIV could cause premature senescence of enterocytes and decrease brushborder expression of disaccharidases and peptidases. Some of these same agents, such as the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-a), are upregulated by HIV infection, affect intermediate metabolism, and cause malnutrition by increasing nutrient requirements. The effects of HIV on the immune system are well known and result in immunocompromise and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infection. Similar immunoregulatory abnormalities probably occur in the mucosal immune system, resulting in enteric infection. Thus, HIV interacts at many levels to potentiate the development of malabsorption, malnutrition, immune deficiency, and enteric infection.",

Giardia ZambZia does not occur more frequently in HIVinfected children than in the general population, but retreatment may be necessary in the immunocompromised host. Crypfosporidium parvum causes an acute, self-limited diarrheal illness in the immunocompetent host, but in the immunodeficient child with HIV disease, the infection causes a secretory diarrhea that is chronic and debilitating. The organism usually can be identified in the stool by immunofluorescent techniques or by Kinyoun carbolfuchsin stain.7 In HIV-infected children in the United States, the incidence of cryptosporidiosis is lower than that reported in Africa and South America.2, 4, 33 Crypfosporidium can infect the small intestine, colon, gallbladder, biliary tract, and pancreatic duct. No therapy is consistently effective in eradicating the organism, but octreotide is reported to decrease stool Reports of the beneficial effects of hyperimmune bovine colostrum suggest that this form of passive immunotherapy may be effective in HIV-infected individual^.^^ Other enteric parasitic infections, including Isospora beZZi and Microsporidium, are rarely identified in HIV-infected children; however, Blastocysfis hominis, a protozoan whose role as an enteric pathogen is still debated, may be more prevalent in HIV-infected children with diarrhea than in HIV-negative ~h i l d r e n .~ Bacteria are an important cause of diarrhea throughout the world and for this reason contribute to the list of identifiable pathogens found in HIV-infected children. In Africa, pathogenic strains of Escherickia coli were identified in over three fourths of HIV-infected children. 22 The risk for other bacterial enteric infections is not known for HIV-infected children, but the incidence of Salmonella, Skigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Clostridium difficile do not seem to be increased in HIV-infected children. The incidence of Helicobacter pylori may be decreased in HIVinfected chi1dren.l The most serious enteric bacterial infection is Mycobacterium avium-intrace2lulare, which causes a multisystemic infection involving the lungs, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and bone marrow in the most severely immunocompromised hosts with CD4 counts less than 50 cells/mm3. Acidfast bacilli can be identified in the jejunal mucosa or grown from stool or blood. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms of M avium-intracellulare are abdominal pain and diarrhea, and neither responds dramatically to therapeutic intervention. Combinations of medications chosen from clarithromycin, ethambutol, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, rifampin, clofazamine, and azithromycin have been tried.14 Rotavirus is the viral agent that most frequently causes chronic diarrhea. In the immunocompromised child, rotaviral diarrhea can be severe, persistent, and difficult to distinguish from other agents causing secretory diarrhea. Diagnosis is established by identification of rotavirus in the stool using an enzyme-linked immunoassay. Enterally administered serum immunoglobulin is effective therapy,I5 but little published data exist on the treatment for rotavirus in HIV-infected children. Other viral pathogens, such as adenoviruses, can cause diarrhea but also are associated with systemic infection and fulminant hepatitis. Cytomegalovirus usually causes an asymptomatic enteric infection, but some individuals develop focal ulcerations in the colon or jejunum and present with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal bleeding is unusual in HIV-infected children, but, when present, it may be caused by focal ulcerations in the colon, stomach, small intestine, or esophagus from cytomegalovirus-induced disease. Merely culturing cytomegalovirus from the intestinal mucosa does not establish a link between diarrhea and the infection. Histologic evidence of mucosal injury is necessary. Ganciclovir and foscarnet are used to treat cytomegalovirus-induced intestinal disease in children with active symptoms. Bone marrow suppression is the main serious side effect.",

Blood and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the stool are indicative of colitis and should prompt evaluation of the colonic mucosa. If no enteric pathogen is identified, functional tests, such as lactose breath hydrogen and D-xylose absorption, may be useful in guiding nutritional therapy.

            "text": "The initial assessment of HIV-infected children with failure to thrive is directed at determination of caloric intake, nutrient losses, and metabolic requirements. If caloric intake is diminished, the reason for anorexia should be determined. Nausea, abdominal pain, oral lesions, depression, despair, or lack of access to food need to be evaluated by the health care team. Nutrient losses caused by diarrhea and malabsorption may contribute to increased nutrient requirements. Enhanced metabolic requirements from febrile illnesses, recurrent infection, or from HIV replication may result in weight loss. Anti-retroviral therapy can result in weight gain shortly after starting therapy. 23 Counseling and oral supplements are the first steps in nutritional treatment for children with weight loss or decreased lean body mass. Providing increased calories and protein may reverse the loss, but most children require additional measures of support. Although nasogastric tube feeding is simple and effective for short-term management, the adverse effect on quality of life and the increased possibility of sinus disease are limiting factors. In children requiring nutritional supplementation lasting greater than 2 weeks, endoscopic placement of a gastrostomy tube button increases compliance and tolerance. As many as 150% recommended daily allowance for calories may be required to achieve weight gain in HIV-infected children. Newly developed one-step gastrostomy buttons permit endoscopic insertion of devices that do not limit activity and provide access for nutritional support. Despite providing sufficient nutrition to gain weight, enteral supplementation16 and gastrostomy tube feedings\" do not increase lean body mass in HIV-infected children. Similarly, appetite stimulants, such as megestrol acetate, a progesterone derivative, and dronabinol, a tetrahydrocannabinol derivative, do not increase lean body mass in adults infected with HIV. Promising data in adults suggest that mammalian cell-derived recombinant human growth hormone therapy results in weight gain and anabolism as measured by stool nitrogen, urine nitrogen, and potassium excretion.20 If valid in the pediatric population, growth hormone could prove to be an effective treatment for failure to thrive by increasing lean body mass.",

Similarly, deficiencies of iron, zinc, and selenium have been described in HIV-infected individuals. Although these minerals have an important role in immunoregula- The redundancy of the immune system to provide protection against infection suggests that by the time the system begins to fail, no single cause can be found to correct the problem. For this reason, supplementation with a single therapeutic nutrient intervention can improve laboratory phenomena, but rarely impacts on a patient's quality of life or immunoregulatory defects.",

The respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are exposed to the environment and, in response, have developed complex systems to protect their mucosal surfaces from pathogens. Antibody production, cell-mediated immune function, complement, and phagocytic function act together to prevent infection and uncontrolled inflammation. In the gastrointestinal tract, enteric pathogens and chronic inflammatory bowel disease are the two major clinical aspects of primary immune deficiency. Surprisingly, individuals with identical deficiencies may not experience similar gastrointestinal symptoms. For example, children with immunoglobulin A deficiency may be asymptomatic or may have chronic diarrhea associated with chronic intestinal inflammation disease. In general, children with T-cell defects seem to have a higher incidence of chronic gastrointestinal problems compared with children with antibody defiqiency syndromes, complement defects, or disorders of phagocytic function.
