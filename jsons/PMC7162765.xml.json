Thus, we rapidly developed a local protocol for the triage and management of ACS patients. In particular, we conceived a customized pathway in order to allocate patients to the appropriate hospital ward, and treat them according to ACS severity and the risk of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initially, we have significantly reduced, and in the last four weeks suspended, truly elective procedures in the catheterization laboratories and cardiovascular operating rooms to preserve resources and avoid patient exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Two interventional teams have been dedicated to ACS patients: one working in turn to provide in-hospital 24-hour coverage and the other one being 24-hour on-call. Thus, in the case of an excessive volume of patients, it has been planned to use two catheterization laboratories at the same time and, eventually, additional beds outside the ICCU located in the adjacent post-operative intensive care unit.",

In STEMI patients who are referred to our Emergency Department (ED), conservative care cannot be considered an option in the majority of the cases, and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) still is our standard of care. Patients, in whom for obvious reason there is not time to wait for nasopharyngeal swab result, are immediately transferred to a catheterization laboratory dedicated only to those potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2 and are subjected to coronary angiography and primary PCI. Notably, despite our catheterization laboratory has about 20 air exchange times per hour, it is not under negative pressure. Therefore, it is sanitized after each procedure by a dry and non-toxic environment micronized disinfecting treatment (PoliDisinTM Air biosteril, Treviso, Italy). After primary PCI, patients are admitted to our 13-bed ICCU within which 5 beds (\u201cred\u201d area) are dedicated to these patients who are considered potentially infected until the result of the diagnostic test. The swab is performed, observing safety rules during specimen collection, as soon as they enter the ICCU and the result is available within 3-4 hours (GeneFinderTM COVID-19 RealAmp Kit, ELITechGroup S.p.A, Torino, Italy). In case of a negative swab result and in the absence of suspicious symptoms of virus infection, the patients are moved from the \u201cred\u201d to the \u201cgreen\u201d ICCU area and, when the acute phase is over, they are transferred to the ordinary ward where only SARS-CoV-2-negative patients are hospitalized. If the clinical suspicion is high and a second swab remains negative, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan is performed. Conversely, in case of a positive test, they remain in the \u201cred\u201d ICCU area through the acute phase and then are transferred to the ward dedicated only to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (Figure\n). Separate staff of nurses and doctors take care of patients in \u201cred\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d ICCU areas. In order to minimize the infection risk within the ICCU \u201cred\u201d area, the following preventive measures are adopted: 1) a single patient room is reserved for patients requiring mechanical ventilation or admitted with an already known SARS-CoV-2-infection; 2) distance of at least two meters between patients separated by a plastic sheet divider; 3) a 1:1 nursing/patient ratio until the swab result is available. Finally, a more rapid (20 minutes) SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy will be available within the next two weeks for early identification of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, in order to further minimize their stay in the \u201cred\u201d area. As in the catheterization laboratories, ICCU and ordinary ward beds are not under negative pressure. However, they undergo a rapid (30 minutes/100 m3) sanitization after each patient discharge, with the same technology used in the catheterization laboratories.",

High-risk NSTE-ACS, as defined by hemodynamic and/or electrical (life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest) instability, recurrent or ongoing chest pain refractory to medical treatment, and/or relevant ST-T wave changes, follow the STEMI protocol. Patients with NSTE-ACS without the characteristics mentioned above are evaluated in the ED in a dedicated and monitored \u201cred\u201d area and undergo nasopharyngeal swab, and eventually chest CT scan, immediately after ACS diagnosis. The rationale to perform a swab at hospital admission in all patients derives from the high prevalence of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Lombardy who must be isolated. The aim is to reduce the risk of infection spreading within the hospital by keeping separate clinical pathways between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative patients. In case of a negative test result and absence of suspicious symptoms of virus infection, the patient is transferred to an ordinary monitored ward where only SARS-CoV-2-negative patients are hospitalized. Coronary angiography and possibly a PCI are performed within 24 hours in the catheterization laboratory reserved for these patients. On the other hand, when the swab result is positive, the patient is admitted to an ordinary monitored ward dedicated only to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with a view of deferring the invasive procedure provided she/he has hemodynamic stability. On the contrary, if the invasive approach is considered clinically indicated, the procedure is performed in the catheterization laboratory dedicated to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients.",

Of them, 9 (10%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab at hospital admission or soon after primary PCI, without overt infection symptoms. Only one patient, among those with an initial negative swab, developed symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 during hospitalization and underwent a second swab and CT scan, which both resulted positive. Of note, no death due to COVID-19 occurred during this preliminary experience. The short duration of the observation period prevents conclusions being drawn about the ability of our protocol to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within the hospital. This will need a much larger sample size with a meticulous nosocomial infection tracking. Similarly, it is premature to make assumptions regarding the cardiac outcome of these patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, preliminary experience indicates an overall reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for ACS and their delayed hospital presentation, a phenomenon that is being observed also in other European countries4 and in the United States5. A possible and concerning explanation may be that ACS patients decide to stay at home instead of going to the hospital because COVID-19 has created the fear of being infected in the hospital environment. Unfortunately, when they finally seek medical attention it is often late in the course of the ACS when their condition has worsened. Supporting this alarming theory is our observation of a higher rate of cardiogenic shock and in-hospital cardiac mortality in the last four weeks when compared with the same time interval of the previous year (Table). If patients delay or avoid care for life-threatening conditions like ACS because of the pandemic fear, then death rate may extend far beyond that directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

To this regard, we acknowledge that our protocol can be considered suboptimal, as it suffers from several physical and technical limitations. An ideal approach would be to have negative pressure facilities and physically separated ICCU beds for SARS-CoV-2 infected and non-infected patients. However, these structural changes cannot be achievable in the short-term in most hospitals worldwide. Indeed, it is noteworthy that, for what concerns negative pressure in the catheterization laboratories, the vast number of them in the United States have either normal or positive ventilation systems because they are not designed for infection isolation.2 Moreover, we currently lack data comparing our ongoing in-hospital organization for ACS patients with a theoretically optimal one with separated facilities. It is to be hoped that such data can be obtained in order to determine whether and to what extent major investments are justified.",
