            "text": "Bovine group A rotavirus (BoRV-A) is an important pathogen that causes neonatal calf diarrhea (Ishizaki et al., 1996, Fukai et al., 1998, De Verdier Klingenberg et al., 1999, Falcone et al., 1999, Alfieri et al., 2004). Viruses classified as group A rotavirus (RV-A), including BoRV-A, possess two independent neutralization antigens, namely, VP4 and VP7, on the outer capsid, that specify the P type (for protease-sensitive protein) and G type (for glycoprotein), respectively (Estes, 2001, Kapikian et al., 2001). To date, six P types (P6[1], P7[5], P8[11], P11[14], P[17], and P[21]) and 8 G types (G1, G3, G5, G6, G7, G8, G10 and G15) have been reported among BoRV-A (Matsuda et al., 1990, Blackhall et al., 1992, Br\u00fcssow et al., 1992, Isegawa et al., 1994, Fukai et al., 1999, Fukai et al., 2005, Rao et al., 2000, Alfieri et al., 2004). Types G2 and G11 in BoRV-A have been detected using PCR-derived cDNA probes (Hussein et al., 1993). Reports on the distribution patterns of these types reveal that P7[5], P8[11], G6, and G10 are the most common (Fukai et al., 1998, Falcone et al., 1999, Gulati et al., 1999, Okada and Matsumoto, 2002, Alfieri et al., 2004). G8 ranks third among the most common G type in BoRV-A, and several G8 strains reported to date have been detected and/or isolated sporadically, or their prevalence has been reported (Sato et al., 1997, Falcone et al., 1999, Fukai et al., 1999, Okada and Matsumoto, 2002, Fodha et al., 2005).",

There were several reports of adult diarrhea caused by RV-A in humans (Hrdy, 1987, Iturriza-G\u00f3mara et al., 2000, Del Refugio Gonzalez-Losa et al., 2001, Griffin et al., 2002). We discovered the prevalence of adult cattle diarrhea in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan, in 2004, and detected BoRV-As from these diarrheic specimens. The P and G types in these diarrheic specimens could not be identified using RT-PCR. The purpose of this study was to genetically characterize the detected BoRV-A by the partial sequence analysis of the genome segments encoding the proteins VP4 and VP7.",

            "text": "The prevalence of adult cattle diarrhea was noted in a dairy farm in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan, in October 2004. This dairy farm raised approximately 90 dairy cattle, and approximately 8 adult cattle suffered from watery diarrhea for nearly 9 days. In contrast, no calves raised on this farm suffered from diarrhea over this period. Unfortunately, we did not record the incidence of diarrhea in adult cattle and calves raised on this farm after the observation period. The diarrheic specimens were obtained from four adult cattle aged 3, 4, 5, and 8 years, and RV-A was detected from these specimens by using the commercial kit Rotascreen (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BoRV-A was attempted to isolate from the diarrheic specimens in MA-104 cells in the presence of trypsin as described previously (Matsuda et al., 1990). Indirect immunofluorescence assay using anti-BoRV-A hyperimmune guinea pig serum, which has been described previously, was used to detect BoRV-As in MA-104 cells inoculated with the diarrheic specimens, culture supernatants, and infected cell culture lysates (Knowlton et al., 1991). Viral genomic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was extracted from the diarrheic specimens by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted dsRNA was then analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and silver staining, as described previously (Fukai et al., 1998). The dsRNA was also used for first-stranded cDNA synthesis by MuLV-reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and the cDNA was amplified by PCR using the ReadyMix Taq PCR Reaction Mix (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) as described previously (Fukai et al., 1998). In order to perform P typing, Bov4Com5, Bov4Com3, P1, P5, P10, con2, con3, pNCDV, pUK, and pB223 primers were synthesized as described by Isegawa et al. (1993) and Gouvea et al. (1994a). To perform G typing, sBeg9, End9(UK), DT6, HT8, and ET10 primers were synthesized as described by Gouvea et al., 1990, Gouvea et al., 1993, Gouvea et al., 1994b. Subsequently, the genome segments encoding the VP7s of the detected BoRV-As were amplified by PCR, using the primers VP7-MS (sense, 5\u2032-CRGARYTAGATATGTCAGAA-3\u2032, 491-510) and VP7-MA (antisense, 5\u2032-AAYGTTATGTCCATYGGATT-3\u2032, 563\u2013544). Among the four diarrheic specimens obtained, the PCR-amplified products of the specimen termed Tak2 were selected and sequenced. The products were ligated into the pMOSBlue vector (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA), and both strands were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI PRISM 3100 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the genome segments encoding VP4 and VP7 of Tak2 were compared with the corresponding RV-A sequences, which have been published previously. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987) using Clustal W (Thompson et al., 1994), and the bootstrap probabilities of each node were calculated using 1000 replicates. The final tree was obtained using the TreeView program, version 1.6.6 (Page, 1996). The other causative agents of adult cattle diarrhea, such as bovine group B and C rotaviruses, bovine coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, Clostridium spp., Salmonella spp. and Coccidium spp. were examined as described previously (Chinsangaram et al., 1994, Vilcek et al., 1994, Tsunemitsu et al., 1999a, Tsunemitsu et al., 1999b, Asai et al., 2002, Choi et al., 2003, Mawatari et al., 2004).",

However, phylogenetic analysis of the aa sequences of the VP8* of 26 P genotypes in RV-As revealed that the P[22] and P[23] types were closely related to the P[13] and P[24] types, respectively (Martella et al., 2006). In contrast, Tak2 was observed to share a common origin with the P[11] and P[17] types, which appeared to have a distinct genetic origin as compared to the VP4s belonging to the other P genotypes in previous study (Rao et al., 2000). These results suggested that Tak2 could be a novel P genotype. Despite numerous efforts, the amplification of the PCR product, including the complete genome segment encoding VP4, of all four diarrheic specimens contained Tak2 and the determination of those sequences have been unsuccessful to date. The present study suggests that Tak2 is a BoRV-A with a novel P genotype specificity, which has not been reported among BoRV-A thus far.",

            "text": "The feces of the animals were screened against a broad panel of viruses, bacteria and parasites, but the presence of other undetected pathogens, such as caliciviruses, parvoviruses, Escherichia coli, Yersinia spp., Campylobacter spp., or Giardia spp. was not investigated. Accordingly, it is not possible to associate the outbreak of diarrhea in adult cattle with the novel RV-A strain Tak2. However, BoRV-A in adult cattle with diarrhea have been already detected (Sato et al., 1997). The factors responsible for symptomatic infections by BoRV-A in adult cattle are unknown. Immunity raised against BoRV-A carrying unusual P and G type specificities, such as Tak2, is estimated to be low because P7[5], P8[11], G6, and G10 are the most common P and G types in BoRV-A, according to previous studies (Fukai et al., 1998, Falcone et al., 1999, Gulati et al., 1999, Okada and Matsumoto, 2002, Alfieri et al., 2004). Accordingly, the lack of homotypic immunity (specific for Tak2-like RV-As) may be one of the factors that have helped the virus to infect and cause disease in adult animals. The isolation of BoRV-A from the specimens of adult cattle diarrhea in this study needs to be repeated, and serological surveillance on these isolates in cattle is necessary in the future. However, the fact that no calf raised in this farm was affected with diarrhea is inconsistent with the above hypothesis. These questions warrant further studies to evaluate the pathogenic attitude of the strain Tak2.",

The discovery of BoRV-A Tak2, which may have a unique combination of novel VP7 and VP4 types, is an example of the enormous diversity among the circulating RV-A strains. Complete genome sequencing of all 11 segments may help to understand the origin of the unusual BoRV-A strain Tak2. The evolution of RV-As is the result of interspecies transmissions, reassortment of genome segments between diverse strains, genome rearrangements and accumulation of point mutations. The recent discovery of novel P and G types has important implications in future Human RV-A vaccine strategies. Since domestic animals, including cattle, may serve as an important reservoir of novel RV-A strains, epidemiological RV-A surveillance needs to be performed regularly.",
