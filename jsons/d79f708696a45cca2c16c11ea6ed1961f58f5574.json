Each continuous variable was centralized, and z-score transformed. Thus, the transformed variables passed the normality test and the correlation matrix was created. Bivariate, partial correlation, and regression were used to test hypotheses of association. The correlation coefficients between \"Death Rate\" or \"Infection Rate\" with independent variables were calculated by Pearson's correlation (R corr package). Partial correlation was further evaluated by Pearson's correlation (R ppcor package) to determine if the existing correlation was still valid after controlling the second independent variable. Bonferroni correction for multiple testing of controlling variables was considered to adjust the p-value of the correlation. Bivariate linear regression adjusted for \"State\" variables was utilized to test the association between \"Death Rate\" or \"Infection Rate\" with independent variables. The raw p-value was present in the forest plot. False discovery rate (FDR) corrections for multiple testing were calculated using the Benjamin and Hochberg procedure.

The conflicting results for counties' population could be related to the population density, easier access to the high quality of healthcare, and more experience managing the COVID-19 infection due to the higher number of patients. One can argue that counties with fewer residents have a higher rural population. Studies have shown that there are significant differences in the overall healthcare assessment of rural populations as compared to urban populations. 16 Our observation is also aligned with a recent analysis of health differences in 3,053 US counties, showing that rural areas are more likely to have poorer health outcomes. 17 The association of poverty and disability makes the conclusion of this study more complex and beyond the analysis of social determinants. By adding the interaction terms in the linear regression model (Death Rate ~ Poverty + Disability + Poverty:Disability) of Death Rate, we do not observe a significant interaction (p =0.469), suggesting these two variables could be independent in their contribution to the risk of mortality.

Finally, access to insurance was a protective factor in terms of mortality from COVID-19, but access to insurance did not significantly associate with the rate of infection. Comparison of counties with higher or lower than median death rates provided further evidence of the association of lower median income, and higher poverty levels across all the races with mortality. The counties with a higher death rate also had a higher percentage of people on Medicaid. The latter is expected since Medicaid is significantly associated with the rate of poverty (Pearson correlation: 0.769, p<0.005) as well as the rate of disability (Pearson correlation: 0.428, p<0.005). Descriptive statistics of data from all the states also corroborates that African Americans might be disproportionally affected by this pandemic as of April 16, 2020. This observation is consistent with the H1N1 pandemic, where studies have shown evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in the population affected in terms of exposure, severity, and mortality of the disease. 7, 8 Finally historical data have taught us that minorities and people of color tend to be more affected by different diseases.

Implications of the results from this study highlight the value of the targeted interventions, as different counties, even within the same state, may have different characteristics and different needs. Furthermore, as the association between COVID-19 related fatality and infection is different among different race and health status, it is important to further study the impact of the immune system and immune-boosting strategies in the at-risk population (such as people with certain disabilities or those residing in elderly community centers), as preventive measure along with other measures based on social distancing guidelines and the ability to work from home. This is the first systematic study on the racial, health, and economic disparity, as well as education, mobility, and COVID-19 infection in the US with the available data from the most severely impacted states. Our study had several limitations; the data was not granular, and we had missingness, especially for smaller and less populated counties. Access to the infected patient information and mortality data was not possible, and only aggregated data were used.",

The lack of clarity resulted in partially reported data for the death and case rate per million reported in this article, due to some states reporting on racial data for one, two, or all the racial variables specified in this study. The infection rate estimate may be underrepresented, as some individuals may have mild symptoms but lacked clinical validation of the infection. Finally, our in-depth analysis was based on only seven states, leading to conclusions that may not be generalizable to other regions. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
