Influenza virus antigen expression was closely associated with the presence of histological lesions at different levels of the lower respiratory tract. In the new H1N1 virus and HPAI H5N1 virus groups, influenza virus antigen expression was seen predominantly in type 1 and 2 pneumocytes (Figure 4B and 4C), alveolar macrophages, bronchiolar epithelial cells, and bronchial epithelial cells. In the seasonal H1N1 virus group, influenza virus antigen expression was seen in the same cell types but was rare at any level of the lower respiratory tract. Quantitative scoring showed that influenza virus antigen expression in the new H1N1 virus group was high at all 3 levels of the lower respiratory tract (alveoli, bronchioles, and bronchi) (Figure 5). This contrasted to the influenza virus antigen expression in the HPAI H5N1 virus group, which was highest in alveoli, and lower in bronchioles and bronchi; and with that in the seasonal H1N1 virus group, which was most prominent in bronchi, but low at all 3 levels. The immunohistochemical scores among the 3 virus groups differed significantly for the alveoli (P < .001 ; ANOVA, F = 217 ) and bronchi (P = .01 ; ANOVA, F = 8.0). The new H1N1 virus group had significantly higher immunohistochemical scores than the seasonal H1N1 virus group for alveoli (P <.001 ; Tukey test) and bronchi (P = .01 ; Tukey test), and significantly higher immunohistochemical bronchial scores than did the HPAI H5N1 virus group (P = .03; Tukey test).
