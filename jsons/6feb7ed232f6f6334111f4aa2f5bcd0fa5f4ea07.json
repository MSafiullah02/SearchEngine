The mortality rate of our patients is consistent with the data reported in literature (22% vs 28%) as well as the incidence of severe events [7] .

Patient with symptoms must be rescheduled -Allow access to visitors only if essential to the visit -Prohibit access to visitors to the hemopoietic stem cell transplantation unit and to the inpatient hematology ward -Increased interval between visits to reduced waiting time -Postpone routine follow-up visits for patients not on active cancer treatment (e.g. 6-12 months survivorship visits) and conduct appointments via telemedicine -Respect of lifestyle restrictionsFacility re-organization: -Limit access to the hospital through one point of entry -Establish triage stations outside the hospital to screen patients and visitors for COVID-19 symptoms -Convert waiting area to allow for distancing of at least 1 meter -Dedicate a confined hospital area for patients with respiratory symptoms who present to the oncological/hematological admission room (e.g. COVID-19 room) Staff: -Provide personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g. surgical face mask) and access to cleaning/disinfecting agents for all the staff members -Train clinic staff for symptom recognition, screening procedures and PPE use -Reduce the number of non-medical staff in the clinic by allowing work-from-home for phone-based activities -Organize web-based multidisciplinary team meeting -Respect of lifestyle restrictions From 23 rd February to 31 st March 2020, 1257 patients on active anticancer treatment attended our Institution, 93% of whom on an outpatient setting. All the staff activities were rescheduled following our practical COVID-19 guideline. During this period, only 9 patients were diagnosed as symptomatic COVID-19 infection corresponding to 0,71% of patients on active anticancer drugs treated in our hospital. All of them received their anticancer treatments as outpatients. Patients' characteristics and clinical outcome of COVID-19 infections are summarized in Table 1. In particular, 5 patients had hematological malignancy while 4 had an active solid tumor. Median age was 74 years (range from 65 to 86 years) and all had co-morbidities other than cancer. Considering time from last visit/treatment and the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, in two-thirds of patients a nosocomial transmission could not be excluded. All but one required hospitalization due to rapid deteriorating conditions. Two of them (22%) died due to COVID-19 infection, both with gastrointestinal solid tumor. Evidence from our experience suggested that the practical health recommendations adopted in our hospital significantly decrease the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection in cancer patients under active treatment. In our opinion, cancer care cannot be postponed only on the basis of the risk of COVID-19 infection. Physicians should take into account patient age and clinical needs, comorbidities, expectancy of life when choosing a cancer treatment even during COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, our study population also included patients on immunosuppressive treatment for hematological malignancies, who are well known to have a more profound immune suppression status than those with solid tumor, reinforcing the value and positive impact of our recommendations. The beneficial effects of the extensive use of surgical masks by patients and staff members have recently and formally been demonstrated too [5]. Moreover, our strict restrictions have kept workers safe and have limited the spread of COVID-19 infection among health care personnel too. In particular, we have tallied only 3 cases of COVID-19 infections in health workers, corresponding to 1,66% of the Modena Cancer Center medical staff.",

In conclusion, following our practical health vigilance recommendations, physicians should be confident in maintaining lifesaving anticancer treatment without exceedingly increasing the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection. The high rate of mortality suggested that all patients on active anticancer treatment with flu-like symptoms have to be carefully screen for COVID-19 infection.",
