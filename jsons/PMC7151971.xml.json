HAIs can result in the serious morbidity and mortality such as occur in adults and in lifetime physical, neurologic, and developmental disabilities. Host, or intrinsic, factors that make children particularly vulnerable to infection are immaturity of the immune system, congenital abnormalities, and congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies. Innate deficiencies of the immune system in prematurely born infants, who may be hospitalized for prolonged periods of time and exposed to intensive monitoring, supportive therapies, and invasive procedures, contribute to the high rates of infection in the NICU. All components of the immune system are compromised in neonates and the degree of deficiency is proportional inversely to the gestational age (see Chapter 9, Immunologic Development and Susceptibility to Infection). Additionally, the underdeveloped skin of the very-low-birthweight (VLBW, <1000 g) infant provides another mode of entry for pathogens. Populations of immunosuppressed children have expanded with the advent of more intense immunosuppressive therapeutic regimens used for oncologic conditions, HSCTs, solid-organ transplantation, and rheumatologic conditions and inflammatory bowel disease for which immunosuppressive agents and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 inhibitors (infliximab (Remicade)) and other immune modulators are used.",

Rates of umbilical catheter- and CVC-associated BSIs varied by birthweight (BW) from 3.5 per 1000 catheter-days in those >2500 g BW, to 9.1 per 1000 catheter-days in those <1000 g BW (Table 2-2\n). Medical device-related infections (e.g., CLABSIs, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and surgical site infections (SSIs)) can be prevented by implementing 3 to 5 sets or \u201cbundles\u201d of evidence-based practices, as defined in the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) 100,000 Lives Campaign (www.ihi.org/IHI/Programs/Campaign), the NACHRI collaboratives (www.childrenshospitals.net),9 and single center studies. This effect is evident in the NHSN data summary for 2009.1 Although the highest rates of CLABSI (5.3 per 1000 catheter-days) in ICUs occurred in burn ICUs, and in smallest infants in NICUs (3.4 per 1000 catheter-days at \u2264750 g) rates fell in all units/groups measured (TABLE 2-1, TABLE 2-2). In the NHSN reports for 2006\u2013200822 and for 2009,1 data are presented for CLABSI in pediatric hematology-oncology units: permanent-line CLABSI rates per 1000 catheter-days were 2.3 and 3.0, respectively, and temporary-line CLABSI rates were 4.6 and 4.8, respectively. Use of more specialized life-saving technologies, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), hemodialysis/hemofiltration, pacemakers, and implantable ventricular assist devices (VADs), further increases the risk of infection in the sickest children who require the most intense, prolonged, and invasive support. However, these infections are not included in the NHSN device-associated module and no benchmarking data are available.",

Infants, however, may have such limited vascular access that catheters remain in place until they become unnecessary, nonfunctional, or contaminated. Additionally, the specific indications for prophylaxis against deep-vein thrombosis and peptic ulcers have not been defined for children requiring mechanical ventilator support; some evidence suggests that prophylaxis against peptic ulcers is associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and candidemia in LBW (<1500 g) infants.23\n",

A significant association between reduced levels of nurse staffing and appropriately trained nurses has been demonstrated to increase risk in many studies in both children and adults.24 There are theoretical concerns that infection risk also will increase in association with the innovative practices of co-bedding and kangaroo care in the NICU because of increased opportunity for skin-to-skin exposure of multiple-gestation infants to each other and to their mothers, respectively. Overall, the infection risk is reduced with kangaroo care,25 but transmission of tuberculosis26 and RSV27 has occurred in kangaroo mother care units in South Africa. Neither the benefits nor the safety of co-bedding multiple-birth infants in the hospital setting have been demonstrated in studies reviewed by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2007. With increasing numbers of procedures being performed by pediatric interventional radiologists, an understanding of appropriate aseptic technique and recommended regimens for antimicrobial prophylaxis is important.28\n",

Most infectious agents are transmitted by the contact route via hands of HCP, but many pathogens can be transmitted by more than one route. Viruses, bacteria, and Candida spp. can be transmitted horizontally. Although the source of most Candida HAIs is the patient's endogenous flora, horizontal transmission, most likely via HCP's hands, has been demonstrated in studies using DNA fingerprinting in the NICU and in a pediatric oncology unit.32 Transmission of infectious agents by the droplet route requires exposure of mucous membranes to large respiratory droplets (>5 \u00b5m) within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) of the infected individual, who may be coughing or sneezing. Large respiratory droplets do not remain suspended in the air. Adenovirus, influenza virus, and rhinovirus are transmitted primarily by the droplet route whereas other respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, parainfluenza) are transmitted primarily by the contact route. Although influenza virus can be transmitted via the airborne route under unusual conditions of reduced air circulation or relative humidity, there is ample evidence that transmission of influenza is prevented by droplet precautions and, in the care of infants, the addition of contact precautions.33\n",

Roy and Milton proposed a new classification for aerosol transmission when evaluating routes of SARS transmission:34 (1) obligate: under natural conditions, disease occurs following transmission of the agent only through small-particle aerosols (e.g., tuberculosis); (2) preferential: natural infection results from transmission through multiple routes, but small-particle aerosols are the predominant route (e.g., measles, varicella); and (3) opportunistic: agents naturally cause disease through other routes, but under certain environmental conditions can be transmitted via fine-particle aerosols. This conceptual framework may explain rare occurrences of airborne transmission of agents that are transmitted most frequently by other routes (e.g., smallpox, SARS, influenza, noroviruses). Concern about airborne transmission of influenza arose again during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. However, the conclusion from all published experiences during the 2009 pandemic is that droplet transmission is the usual route of transmission and that surgical masks were non-inferior to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, including 2009 H1N1, among HCP.35, 36 Concerns about unknown or possible routes of transmission of agents that can cause severe disease and have no known treatment often result in more extreme prevention strategies than may be necessary; therefore, recommended precautions could change as the epidemiology of emerging agents is defined and these controversial issues are resolved. Although transmission of M. tuberculosis can occur rarely from an infant or young child with active tuberculosis, the more frequent source is the adult visitor who has not been diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis; thus screening of visiting family members is an important component for control of tuberculosis in pediatric healthcare facilities.37\n",

Although there are insufficient data at this time to support a definitive recommendation for single-patient rooms in NICUs, there is increasing experience that suggests a benefit to reduce the risk of infection and to improve neurosensory development.38 Toddlers often share waiting rooms, playrooms, toys, books, and other items and therefore have the potential of transmitting pathogens directly and indirectly to one another.

RSV infections were more likely to develop in healthy volunteers who held or cuddled infants with RSV infection (cuddlers, 70%) or in those who handled items that the infants had touched, but did not touch the infant (touchers, 41%); infection did not develop in those who sat in the patients\u2019 rooms (sitters) but had no direct contact with the patient, items, or surfaces.42 HCP with mild symptoms of infection also can unknowingly become intermediary hosts and transmit organisms to susceptible children.",

The importance of HA respiratory viral infections in pediatrics was first recognized in 1984.3 The viruses most frequently associated with transmission in a pediatric healthcare facility are RSV, rotavirus, and influenza. With the dramatic reduction in rotavirus infections following introduction of the vaccine, rotavirus now is a rare cause of HAI. However, other respiratory viruses (e.g., parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapnuemovirus) have been implicated in outbreaks in high-risk units. As more respiratory viruses are identified by using highly sensitive molecular methods, epidemiologic studies will be required to define further the risk of transmission in healthcare facilities.55 HA outbreaks of varicella and measles now are rare events due to consistent uptake during the past decade of vaccines in children and HCP. Clinical manifestations of certain pathogens (e.g., RSV and Bordetella pertussis) can be life-threatening in infants and young children, especially those with underlying conditions. Excessive burden of disease and mortality also is associated with influenza in infants and young children.56, 57 Children <18 years of age accounted for approximately 35% (20 million) of cases, 32% (87,000) of hospitalizations, and 10% (1,280) of deaths during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.58\n",

As rates of colonization with CA-MRSA at the time of hospital admission increased, so did transmission of community strains, most often USA 300, within the hospital and especially within the NICU,59 making prevention especially challenging. Other multidrug-resistant organisms, e.g., VRE, ESBLs, and carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, K. pneumoniae carbapenemase), have emerged as the most challenging HA pathogens in both pediatric and adult settings, and otherwise healthy children in the community can be asymptomatically colonized with these multidrug-resistant organisms.60, 61, 62 GNB, including ESBL and other multidrug-resistant isolates, are more frequent than MRSA and VRE in many PICUs and NICUs. Patients who are transferred from chronic care facilities can be colonized with MDR-GNB at the time of admission to the PICU.18 Trends in targeted MDR organisms (MDROs) as tracked in the NNIS/NHSN ICUs are summarized in Table 2-3\n. Continued increases in MRSA, VRE, and certain resistant GNB are a \u201ccall to action\u201d for all healthcare facilities. The CDC campaign to prevent antimicrobial resistance by judicious use of antimicrobial agents (GET SMART, www.cdc.gov/getsmart/) and the Guideline for Management of MDROs in Healthcare Settings, 200663 provide more epidemiologic information. Of note, in 2004, rates of HA-MRSA and VRE plateaued, but the incidence of K. pneumoniae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in ICUs reporting to NHSN increased (www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/ar_mrsa_data.html). HAIs caused by MDROs are associated with increased length of stay, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased cost, in part due to the delay in initiating effective antimicrobial therapy.64 While there is lower prevalence of specific MDROs in pediatric institutions, the same principles of target identification and interventions to control MDROs apply in all settings.",

Risk factors for Candida infections include prolonged length of stay in an ICU, use of CVCs, intralipids, H2-blocking agents, and exposure to third-generation cephalosporins. GNB and Candida sp. are especially important pathogens for HAIs in patients with short gut who are receiving TPN and can cause repeated episodes of sepsis.23, 65 There is now evidence that fluconazole prophylaxis in a subset of very high-risk low-birthweight infants is safe and effective in preventing invasive candidiasis;65 however, the staff of each NICU first must optimize infection practices and then must assess the remaining local risk of Candida infections. Finally, environmental fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Fusarium, Scedosporium, Bipolaris, Zygomycetes), are important sources of infection for severely immunocompromised patients, demanding meticulous attention to the conditions of the internal environment of any facility that provides care for severely immunocompromised patients and prevention of possible exposure to construction dust in and around healthcare facilities.66 With the advent of more effective and less toxic antifungal agents, it is important to identify the infecting agent by obtaining tissue samples and to determine susceptibility to candidate antifungal agents.15\n",

In multidisciplinary medical centers, pediatric infectious disease experts should be consulted for management of pediatric IPC and report to the broader IPC leadership. Infection preventionists (IPs) are specialized professionals with advanced training, and preferably certification, in IPC. Although the majority of IPs are registered nurses, others, including microbiologists, medical technologists, pharmacists, and epidemiologists, are successful in this position. Pediatric patients should have IP services provided by someone with expertise and training in the care of children. In a large, general hospital, at least one IP should be dedicated to IPC services for children. The responsibilities of IPs have expanded greatly in the last decade and include the following: (1) surveillance and IPC in facilities affiliated with primary acute care hospitals (e.g., ambulatory clinics, day-surgery centers, long-term care facilities, rehabilitation centers, home care) in addition to the primary hospital; (2) oversight of occupational health services related to IPC, (e.g., assessment of risk and administration of recommended prophylaxis following exposure to infectious agents, tuberculosis screening, influenza and pertussis vaccination, respiratory protection fit testing, administration of other vaccines as indicated during infectious disease crises such as pre-exposure smallpox vaccine in 2003 and pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccine in 2009); (3) preparedness planning for annual influenza outbreaks, pandemic influenza, SARS, bioweapons attacks; (4) adherence monitoring for selected IPC practices; (5) oversight of risk assessment and implementation of prevention measures associated with construction, renovation, and other environmental conditions associated with increased infection risk; 6) participation in antimicrobial stewardship programs, focusing on prevention of transmission of MDROs; (7) evaluation of new products that could be associated with increased infection risk (e.g., intravenous infusion materials) and for introduction and assessment of performance after implementation; (8) mandatory public reporting of HAI rates in states according to enacted legislation; (9) increased communication with the public and with local public health departments concerning infection control-related issues; and (10) participation in local and multicenter research projects. IPC programs must be adequately staffed to perform all of these activities. Thus, the ratio of 1 IP per 250 beds that was associated with a 30% reduction in the rates of nosocomial infection in the Study on Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) study performed in the 1970s is no longer sufficient, as the complexity of patient populations and responsibilities have increased. Many experts recommend that a ratio of 1 IP per 100 beds is more appropriate for the current workload, but no study has been performed to confirm the effectiveness of that ratio. There is no information on the number of individuals required outside acute care, but it is clear that individuals well trained in IPC must be available for all sites where healthcare is delivered.2\n",

Handling food trays or furniture, pushing wheelchairs or stretchers, using restrooms or phones, having personal contact with patients (e.g., giving information, touching intact skin, bathing, giving a back rub, shaking hands), or doing clerical or administrative duties for a patient do not constitute high-risk exposures. If hands or other skin surfaces are exposed to blood or other potentially infectious material, the area should be washed immediately with soap and water for at least 10 seconds and rinsed with running water for at least 10 seconds. If an eye, the nose, or mouth is splashed with blood or body fluids, the area should be irrigated immediately with a large volume of water. If a skin cut, puncture, or lesion is exposed to blood or other potentially infectious material, the area should be washed immediately with soap and water for at least 10 seconds and rinsed with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Any exposure incident should be reported immediately to the occupational health department and a determination must be made if blood samples are required from the source patient and the exposed individual and if immediate prophylaxis is indicated.",

Strict guidelines for sibling visitation should be established and enforced in an effort to maximize visitation opportunities and minimize risks of transmission of infectious agents. The following recommendations regarding visitation may guide policy development:1Sibling visitation is encouraged in the well-child nursery and NICU, as well as in areas for care of older children.2Before visitation, parents should be interviewed by a trained staff nurse concerning the current health status of the sibling. Siblings should not be allowed to visit if they are delinquent in recommended vaccines, have fever or symptoms of an acute illness, or are within the incubation period following exposure to a known infectious disease. After the interview, the physician or nurse should place a written consent for sibling visitation in the permanent patient record and a name tag indicating that the sibling has been approved for visitation for that day.3Asymptomatic siblings who recently were exposed to varicella but who previously were immunized can be assumed to be immune.4The visiting sibling should visit only his or her sibling and not be allowed in playrooms with groups of patients.5Visitation should be limited to periods of time that ensure adequate screening, observation, and monitoring of visitors by medical and nursing staff members.6Children should observe hand hygiene before and after contact with the patient.7During the entire visit, sibling activity should be supervised by parents or another responsible adult.\n",

Important preventive procedures for HCP with infants at home are: (1) consistent observance of Standard Precautions, Transmission-based Precautions, and hand hygiene according to published recommendations;2, 47 (2) annual influenza and one-time Tdap immunization; (3) routine tuberculosis screening; (4) assurance of immunity or immunization against poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, hepatitis B, and rubella; (5) early medical evaluation for infectious illnesses; (6) routine, on-time immunization of infants; and (7) prompt initiation of prophylaxis/therapy following exposure/development of certain infections.",

In fact, with Standard Precautions and appropriate adherence to environmental cleaning and isolation precautions, vigilant HCP can be at less risk than a preschool teacher, childcare provider, or mother of children with many playmates in the home. Pathogens of potential concern to pregnant HCP include cytomegalovirus, HBV, influenza, measles, mumps, parvovirus B19, rubella, VZV, and M. tuberculosis. Important preventive procedures include documentation of immunity or immunization before pregnancy for rubella, mumps, measles, poliomyelitis, and HBV; annual influenza vaccine; routine tuberculosis screening; early medical evaluation for infectious illnesses; and prompt prophylaxis or therapy if exposed to or infected with certain pathogens. It is important to note that pregnancy is an indication for influenza vaccine to prevent the increased risk of serious disease and hospitalization that occurs in second- and third-trimester women who develop influenza infection. In 2011, the CDC recommended universal immunization with Tdap (if previously not immunized with Tdap) for pregnant women after 20 weeks of gestation.98 Pregnant workers should assume that all patients are potentially infected with cytomegalovirus and other \u201csilent\u201d pathogens and should use gloves (followed by hand hygiene) when handling body fluids, secretions, and excretions. Table 2-7\nsummarizes the information about infectious agents that are relevant to the pregnant woman, and a comprehensive review has been published.99\n",

Transmission of RSV in an HSCT outpatient clinic has been demonstrated using molecular techniques.103 Crowded waiting rooms, toys, furniture, lack of isolation of children, unwell children, contaminated hands, contaminated secretions, and susceptible HCP are only some of the factors that result in sporadic and epidemic illness in outpatient settings. The association of CA-MRSA in HCP working in an outpatient HIV clinic with environmental CA-MRSA contamination of that clinic indicates the potential for transmission in this setting.104 Patient-to-patient transmission of Burkholderia species and P. aeruginosa in outpatient clinics for people with cystic fibrosis has been confirmed and prevented by implementing recommended IPC methods.105, 106 IPC guidelines and policies for pediatric outpatient settings have been published.101 Prevention strategies include definition of policies, education, and strict adherence to guidelines. In pediatrics, one of the most important interventions is segregation of children with respiratory tract illnesses and consistent implementation of respiratory etiquette/cough hygiene. A guideline for infection prevention and control for outpatient settings with a checklist was posted on the CDC website in July, 2011: www.cdc.gov/HAI/pdfs/guidelines/standatds-of-ambulatory-care-7-2011.pdf.",
