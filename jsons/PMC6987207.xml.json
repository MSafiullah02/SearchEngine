While progress has been made in minimizing patient-to-patient spread of HAI bacteria, much remains unknown regarding how these pathogens are transmitted between patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a common cause of HAIs, and in a head-to-head comparison of bloodstream infections (bacteremias), PA was associated with higher mortality than other bacteria2. The reasons for this are poorly understood and this, coupled with the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant PA, make prevention of PA transmission critical3,4. However, such prevention has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of in-host PA infection dynamics and their relationship to transmission among hospitalized patients.",

Once bacteria reach the bloodstream, they are either cleared by the host with the help of antibiotics or die with the host if the infection is fatal. In either case, genetic adaptations in PA that confer an enhanced ability to disseminate to the bloodstream are subsequently eliminated from the gene pool. In this regard, PA is thought to differ from gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi5\u20137 and Listeria monocytogenes8\u201310, which have evolved complex lifecycles that include trafficking from the blood to the gallbladder (GB) and subsequently to the intestines, from which they are excreted in feces to facilitate transmission to new hosts. In contrast, PA bloodstream infections would appear to be accidents from which the bacteria gain no benefit. Thus, the fitness pressures responsible for the evolution of virulence factors that facilitate dissemination of PA to the bloodstream are poorly understood.",

STAMP utilizes barcoded wild-type strains in combination with deep sequencing to track populations of bacteria, assess infection bottlenecks, and allow for assessment of relatedness of pathogen populations at different sampling sites. We demonstrated that bloodstream PA bacteria seeded the liver and subsequently the GB, where they unexpectedly replicated to extremely high numbers. The bacterial population from the GB seeded the intestines and was excreted in the feces in a manner that facilitated transmission to cage-mate mice. Mice lacking a GB (cholecystectomized) excreted dramatically fewer PA bacteria in their intestinal tracks than wild-type mice, highlighting a critical role for this organ in excretion and environmental contamination. The liver\u2013GB\u2013intestinal excretion pathway may therefore facilitate spread of PA from the bloodstream to the intestines and simultaneously allow amplification of PA. In this way, PA from systemic infections are returned to the environment in high numbers in order to enhance transmission between mice.",

At 4 hpi, PA was detected in the liver, lungs, and a minor proportion of GBs, but no bacteria were detected in the intestinal tract (Fig. 1j). This was followed by a drastic six-logarithm expansion of bacteria in the GB by 14 hpi and similar four- to six-logarithm expansion in the intestinal tract (Fig. 1k). In contrast, total bacterial counts in the lung and liver rose by only one- to two-logarithms over the same period, demonstrating that high levels of PA replication was not a universal phenomenon. Bacterial recovery in the GB reached higher numbers than were originally in the inoculum, suggesting that the GB may be a hospitable niche for PA replication. In support of this, we also observed that PA growth in ex vivo bile preparations approached that of enriched medium (Supplementary Fig. 1). By 24 hpi, this dramatic expansion of bacteria had plateaued with only slight additional increases in all organs (Fig. 1l). Lumenal contents of the intestinal tract contained similar bacterial CFU as observed in whole intestine homogenates (Supplementary Fig. 2g; compare to Fig. 1l), indicating that most of the PA bacteria were in the lumen rather than in the bowel wall. These findings indicate that bacteremia is followed by a dramatic expansion of the bacterial population in the GB and intestines, which is accompanied by PA excretion in the feces.",

All PA strains shared the same pattern of dissemination to the GB and excretion into the feces (Supplementary Figs. 2a\u2013d and 3) despite being phylogenetically distinct, globally distributed, and representing nine different multilocus sequence types (STs) (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1). We also challenged male BALB/c mice (Supplementary Fig. 2e) to explore possible gender bias and female C57/BL6 mice (Supplementary Fig. 2f) as an alternate mouse strain background. Male BALB/c mice and female C57/BL6 mice both revealed similar patterns of dissemination, GB expansion, and fecal excretion to the female BALB/c mice. These findings suggest that trafficking to and expansion in the GB, transit to the intestines, and excretion in feces may be universal features of PA bacteremia in mice.",

To investigate these questions, we utilized a technique to genetically track bacterial populations referred to as STAMP11. We first generated a library of barcoded but otherwise isogenic PABL012 (PABL012pool) containing ~4000 unique short (~30 bp) sequence tags inserted into a neutral site on the chromosome. Our goal was to use this library to mathematically estimate the founding population size (Nb) at a given sampling site by measuring barcode frequencies from bacterial populations at that site. The Nb value estimates population diversity and reflects how host barriers may shape bacterial populations during systemic infection. Next, we performed in vitro experiments to optimize STAMP. Control experiments demonstrated that barcodes did not influence growth rate (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and were stable in the absence of antibiotic selection (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Using the barcode frequencies of PABL012pool, we assessed the accuracy of mathematically calculated founding population size (Nb) versus empirically determined Nb values (CFU) from the same samples under controlled in vitro conditions. To accomplish this, we artificially simulated in vitro bottlenecks by sampling serial tenfold dilutions of the PABL012pool and measured the Nb of these samples using both bacterial enumeration and STAMP (Supplementary Fig. 4c). The calculated founding population size underestimated the actual founding population size in vitro, so a calibration curve was generated to adjust our in vivo experimental results to account for this mathematical underestimation, yielding a corrected value referred to as Nb\u02b9 (see Methods section for details)11.",

Mice (n = 10) were injected with PABL012pool; per-organ total CFU counts recovered were consistent with those observed in prior experiments (Fig. 2a, c compared to Fig. 1k, l). At 14 and 24 hpi, the mean founding population sizes (Nb\u02b9) were quite low (between 35\u201370 at 14 hpi and 40\u201360 at 24 hpi) in the majority of the organs. In contrast, the spleen had a larger mean Nb\u02b9 of 1509 at 14 hpi (Fig. 2a) and 523 at 24 hpi (Fig. 2c), indicative of a more diverse founding population that likely reflects the role of the spleen in filtering bacteria from the bloodstream. The low Nb\u02b9 values of the GB and intestines suggest that PA experiences a severe bottleneck in moving from the bloodstream to these organs. This low diversity (Nb\u02b9) coupled with a high bacterial density (CFU), suggests that the few PA cells that traverse this narrow bottleneck are able to replicate to high levels upon arrival in the GB.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the founding population sizes for PA isolated from the liver, GB, intestines and feces were all quite similar, suggesting that these bacterial populations may be related to one another. We hypothesized that the liver may be imposing the tight bottleneck observed in our Nb\u02b9 calculations. Because of the anatomic link between the liver, GB, and intestines, PA bacteria may migrate from the liver to the GB, where they undergo unimpeded replication and subsequent escape from the host via the intestinal tract. To address this hypothesis, specific barcode frequencies (allelic frequencies) of the bacterial populations from pairs of organs taken from individual mice were compared to determine their genetic relatedness (GR) according to the method of Cavalli and Sforza12 (Fig. 2b, d). The PA populations within the GB, small intestine, cecum, colon, and feces of each mouse increased in relatedness from 14 hpi (Fig. 2b) to virtually identical populations by 24 hpi (GR values approaching 1, Fig. 2d). In silico simulations revealed that the high levels of GR observed in our animal experiments were not secondary to chance or influenced by the skewed distribution of barcodes in PABL012pool (Supplemental Figs. 5b, 6b), but suggested that the populations were linked to each other (Supplementary Fig. 7, see Methods section for details). Moreover, at both 14 and 24 hpi, these populations were dominated by the same relatively few sequence barcodes (Fig. 2e, f, Supplementary Figs. 5a and 6a), indicating that a relatively small number of bacteria founded this population and subsequently replicated to high levels. These dominant sequence tags were consistently the dominant sequence tags from the liver (Supplementary Figs. 5a and 6a), suggesting that the population in the GB arose from a subpopulation of cells that migrated from the liver. Taken together, these data suggest that during bacteremia a small subpopulation of PA replicated in the liver and seeded the GB. Once in the GB this population then expanded dramatically, disseminated to the intestines and was excreted in the feces. The lack of high levels of GR between the populations in the lung, spleen and liver suggests that these organs were seeded independently by unique founding populations and that the dynamics of population control within each organ were different (Fig. 2b, d).",

By 2 days post infection, the feces of 100% of infected mice contained between 104 and 108 CFU per gram of feces of PABL012lux, and excretion was sustained over 5 days (Fig. 3a). Beginning at day 6 and continuing through the remainder of the experiment, the number of infected mice shedding this concentration of PABL012lux dramatically declined until all infected mice cleared PA from their stools by day 10 (Fig. 3a). The levels of PA in the feces of infected mice were not influenced by the coprophagic behavior of mice, as infected mice housed on raised wire floors (whereby fecal pellets are inaccessible for ingestion) showed no difference in the fecal bacterial load at 24 hpi compared to infected mice housed on normal bedding (Fig. 3c). To further verify that the observed fecal shedding of bacteremic mice was not a consequence of coprophagia, we tested whether orogastrically delivered PA contributed to the PA load in the feces of bacteremic mice. A PA strain marked with a chromosomal gentamicin resistance cassette (PABL012GM) was administered by oral gavage to mice systemically infected either 4 or 10 h prior with PABL012lux (Fig. 3d). The orally administered strain could only be detected in the feces of two mice when administered 10 h after initial injection of PABL012lux (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, this recovered population of PABL012GM was 1000 times smaller than the fecal population of systemically delivered bacteria (PABL012lux) and had a minimal contribution to the overall bacterial counts in the feces. Together, these experiments indicate that bacteremic mice shed substantial amounts of PA into their environment regardless of mouse coprophagic behaviors.",

Daily cage and water changes were performed to minimize any potential environmental PA reservoirs. Although no uninfected mice displayed any outward signs of PA infection, approximately 60% of the uninfected mice began to excrete PABL012lux (103\u2013104 CFU per gram feces) by day 4, with peak fecal excretion by uninfected mice on day 6 (Fig. 3b). This was followed by a steady decline in bacterial counts in the feces over the remaining 4 days. Moreover, one uninfected mouse continued to excrete PABL012lux at the end of the experiment despite clearance from the originally infected animals, suggesting that this mouse maintained prolonged carriage of PA in the GI tract. These experiments revealed that PA excreted by systemically infected mice may facilitate transmission to uninfected co-housed mice that manifests as detectable numbers of PA in the feces.",

            "text": "We hypothesized that PABL012lux detected in the feces of uninfected mice resulted from ingestion of contaminated fecal pellets shed by infected mice. This observation was somewhat surprising, given our previous results demonstrating the negligible impact of coprophagia on PA in the feces (Fig. 3c, d). Likewise, previous work in mouse models demonstrated that PA cannot access the GI tract through orogastric routes unless extremely high doses of bacteria (>107 CFU per mL drinking water) were administered to antibiotic treated animals depleted of GI microbiota13\u201315. To further explore this phenomenon, we orogastrically delivered large numbers of media-grown PABL012lux to uninfected mice and observed no detectable PA in the feces of these mice at 24-hours post-gavage (Fig. 3g). To test whether the material and microbes present in feces were necessary to facilitate PA carriage, we homogenized PABL012lux-contaminated fecal pellets into a slurry and orally inoculated the slurry (2 \u00d7 105 CFU, maximum obtainable dose from pellets of \u224825 shedding mice) into mice. No bacteria could be detected in the feces of these mice at 24-hours post-gavage (Fig. 3h), indicating that the presence of contaminated fecal material is not sufficient to allow orally administered PA to result in carriage. We, therefore, hypothesized that the nature of the intact fecal pellet in some way facilitates this process. For example, the deeper portions of the pellet may enhance the survival of anaerobic bacteria that promote PA carriage in the GI tract or the pellet architecture might enable PA survival during passage through the acidic environment of the stomach. To address this, we collected all fecal pellets excreted daily from mice infected intravenously with PABL012lux and transferred only the contaminated fecal pellets to the cages of uninfected mice simultaneously with daily cage and water changes. Although the numbers of fecal PA ingested by the uninfected mice could not be determined, it was estimated to be significantly less than the orogastric doses used in the preceding experiments. One uninfected mouse began to excrete PABL012lux by day 4 and additional mice by day 6 (103\u2013104 CFU per gram feces, Fig. 3e, f). These findings confirm that exposure to PA contained within fecal pellets is sufficient to facilitate transmission to uninfected animals. In summary, fecal excretion of PA by bacteremic mice is sufficient to allow transmission, which is manifested by detectable numbers of PA in the feces of na\u00efve mice.",

The T3SS mutant was absent from the liver, GB, and feces when infected at the standard wild-type dose (Fig. 5a, b).

However, in contrast to the mucosal damage observed with wild-type infection, no damage to the GB epithelium was observed at this higher dose (Fig. 5d).

Given our observations following direct inoculation of PA into the bloodstream, we hypothesized that, following pneumonia, PA would disseminate to and expand within the GB. To determine whether GB expansion and fecal excretion were observed following PA pneumonia, 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice were infected by intranasal inoculation with PABL012lux (standard dose, 2 \u00d7 106 CFU) and monitored for 24 hpi. Infected mice displayed a largely disseminated pattern of infection (Fig. 1m) and contained high numbers of bacteria in the liver, GB, and feces (Fig. 1n). These data suggest that following pneumonia, presumably through direct access to the bloodstream, PA can also expand within the liver and GB, and be ultimately excreted in the feces. Thus, both primary and secondary bloodstream infections lead to the excretion of high levels of PA into the environment.",

For example, PA bloodstream infections are associated with mortality rates between 25 and 50%2,20,21. By applying in vivo imaging of bioluminescent bacteria and STAMP analysis to a mouse model of bacteremia, we have identified an unexpected pathway through which PA experiences a narrow bottleneck as it traffics from the bloodstream to the GB and ultimately the intestines. The GB serves as protected expansion niche for PA that facilitates excretion into the environment (Fig. 6). In epidemiologic studies in humans and mice, the GB has been shown to be an important replication niche for a variety of enteric pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi7,22,23, and replication in the GB has been shown to fuel transmission through GI excretion. STAMP was previously applied to Lm bloodstream infection revealing that Lm experiences a similarly narrow bottleneck in the GB and intestines9 and identifying the GB as the main driver of fecal excretion. Here, we show that a similar phenomenon occurs with the non-enteric and healthcare-associated pathogen PA. PA migrates through a narrow bottleneck to reach the GB, and removal of this organ dramatically reduces the levels of PA excreted into the environment. Thus, GB expansion of a small population of bacteria following bloodstream infection is a strategy more universally employed by bacteria than previously appreciated.",

Bile and bile salts have traditionally been viewed as toxic to bacteria24; however, both laboratory-adapted and clinically derived PA strains expanded in the GBs of mice, and select strains grew ex vivo in bile as well as in enriched medium. The mechanisms of bile resistance in PA are unknown; however, a role for multidrug efflux pumps such as MexAB-OprM has been suggested25,26. Thus, bile exposure may promote antibiotic resistance by inducing expression of efflux pumps, and transit through the GB may enhance excretion of drug-resistant PA. Hardy and colleagues suggested that Lm uses the lumen of the GB to escape immune surveillance22, and it is possible that the immune privileged nature of this organ provides an ideal environment for PA replication as well. PA plays an active role in promoting trafficking to and expansion in the GB as these do not occur in the absence of a functional T3SS. These findings suggest that, in addition to enhancing virulence, the PA T3SS functions to promote GI carriage and transmission.",

In patients, such systemic infections are viewed as evolutionary and ecological \u201cdead-ends\u201d in that they are disadvantageous for pathogen survival. Our work challenges this paradigm in the context of mouse infections. Once in the bloodstream, PA enacts a virulence strategy whereby it exploits the GB as a protected replication niche and facilitates its own exit back into the environment via high levels of intestinal excretion. Thus, PA bloodstream infections are not an ecological \u201cdead-end\u201d but rather lead to enhanced GI carriage and fecal excretion which serves as a PA survival and transmission strategy (Fig. 6).",

            "text": "Our results were obtained using a murine model, but it is intriguing to speculate whether they apply to humans. A number of observations indicate that PA can access the GBs of patients. PA is one of the five pathogens most commonly isolated from the bile of individuals with cholecystitis27 and has been associated with secondary sclerosing cholangitis, a dreaded complication of critical illness that involves the biliary system of the liver28. Likewise, PA is a leading cause of acalculous cholecystitis (inflammation of the GB in the absence of gallstones), a common complication of serious medical illness29. In these contexts, it has been suggested that PA gains access to the biliary tree by ascending from the duodenum via the common bile duct. However, it is conceivable that some of these infections are secondary to occult or intermittent PA bacteremia and arrive in the GB via the liver. Likewise, the GI tract is recognized as an important reservoir for PA in hospitalized patients30\u201332, and it is appreciated that PA GI carriage is a precursor to both invasive infections33,34 and environmental contamination. Could this environmental contamination lead to transmission of PA between patients? Transmission of PA via the hands of health care workers35\u201338 or indirectly through contamination of environmental objects such as bedrails, sinks, drains, and endoscopes39,40 has been repeatedly documented and postulated to explain the geographic spread of global epidemic strains, such as sequence type (ST) 111, ST175, and ST23541,42. With regard to transmission via fecal excretion, an obvious difference between mice and people is that the latter are not coprophagic. Yet, fecal\u2013oral spread of other bacterial pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, is clearly common among patients in intensive care units and the cause of considerable infection control efforts. Ample opportunities may therefore exist for PA-contaminated fecal material to also spread from patient-to-patient. However, whether such transferred material contains sufficient numbers of PA and whether it is in a form that facilitates transmission (Fig. 3) is unclear. Additional studies are necessary to examine the role of the GB and intestinal tract in transmission of PA among patients.",

The gentamicin resistance cassette (~1032 bp) from pEX18.Gm53 was amplified with primers P110 (which contains the barcodes) and P8011 (Supplementary Table 4) and inserted into the EcoRI site of the integration proficient plasmid pminiCTX-152.

We compared the mathematically determined founding population sizes to those induced experimentally (Nb). Briefly, we diluted three frozen aliquots of the PABL012pool library (A\u2013C) (50 \u03bcL) 1:100 in MINS and grew with shaking overnight at 37 \u00b0C. In the morning, cultures were diluted into fresh MINS medium and grown at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (13,000\u00d7g, room temperature, 2 min) and resuspended in PBS. A small portion of each serial dilution of each replicate was used to enumerate total CFU, and the remainder was plated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. Following growth, all bacterial colonies were scraped off using Falcon cell scrapers into 5 mL of PBS. Samples were concentrated by centrifugation at 8000\u00d7g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. Genomic DNA was harvested from each sample using the Promega Maxwell 16 Instrument\u00ae and the Cell DNA Purification Kit. The tagged region that harbored the 30-bp barcode was amplified in triplicate from genomic DNA using primer P47 and primers P48, P51\u201373 (Supplementary Table 4). The PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel, pooled, extracted from the gel using Qiagen QIAquick\u00ae gel extraction kit and quantified (Invitrogen Quant-iT\u2122 dsDNA Assay Kit, High Sensitivity). The purified PCR products were combined in equimolar concentrations and sequenced on an Illumina Miseq instrument (Miseq Reagent Kit v2, 50-cycle, Illumina) using custom sequencing primer P4911 (Supplementary Table 4) with a mean cluster density of 8.6 \u00d7 105 \u00b1 2.5 \u00d7 105. Reaper-15-065 was used to discard sequence reads with low quality (\u2264Q30) and to trim the sequence following the barcode56. The trimmed sequences were clustered with QIIME (version 1.9.1) using pick_otus.py with a sequence similarity threshold of 0.957,58. The resulting estimated Nb was mathematically calculated from the frequency of each barcode as described by Abel et al.11 using the method of Krimbas and Tsakas59. These Nb values were then compared to experimentally determined founding population sizes (CFU) to generate a calibration curve (Supplementary Fig. 4c). As mathematically derived Nb values underestimated the actual Nb value based on the calibration curve, this curve was used to adjust Nb values obtained from organs harvested from infected mice yielding corrected founding population sizes (Nb\u2032). For each Nb\u2032 value calculated for every organ in each mouse, 95% confidence intervals are presented (Supplementary Figs. 5d and 6d).",

Barcodes not present in INOC30 were filtered from the barcodes recovered from in vivo experiments. To assess input barcode distribution, the maximum allelic frequency of each barcode present in the inoculum was arrayed on the x-axis in descending frequency (Supplementary Figs. 5b and 6b), which revealed that the maximum allelic frequency of any single barcode in the total population at both 14 and 24 hpi was 1.2%. The vast majority of tags (>99%) were present in the population at <0.5% (allelic frequency < 0.005). To assess the impact of this minor input barcode (inoculum) skew on the output barcode (mouse organ) recovery, the maximum input frequency of each barcode present in the inoculum was plotted on the y-axis verses the maximum output barcode frequency of the identical barcode from a mouse organ (Supplementary Figs. 5c and 6c). Linear regression with best fit analysis was performed and yielded \u201cgoodness of fit\u201d R2 values of 0.157 and 0.097, respectively, suggesting that input barcode allelic frequency had a poor correlation to output barcode frequency, revealing the stochastic nature of barcode loss in our model (GraphPad Prism v7.0b). Had the allelic frequency of the input barcode dictated the output allelic frequency, we would anticipate an observed an R2 value closer to 1.",

First, to model the input population skew, we distributed reads (totaling the average inoculum read count, n = 652,410) to create a simulated inoculum population (INOC_Sim) according to the average frequency of each barcode present in PABL012pool (average of INOC 1\u201330). Next, we determined the median number of unique barcodes present in our experimental bottleneck (M1\u201310 GB, n = 475). We then randomly chose 475 barcodes from our INOC_Sim population where the odds of choosing any one barcode were proportional to its relative frequency in INOC_Sim. Unique read counts (n = 644,750 total) as determined by the average barcode frequency distribution in the GBs were assigned to each selected barcode (e.g., the highest read count was assigned to the first selected barcode and the second highest read count was assigned to the second selected barcode, etc.). Barcodes were only assigned a read count value once and all unselected barcodes were given a read count of zero. In this fashion, 500 unique simulated populations were generated, each having experienced the same bottleneck. The Nb\u2032 values (n = 500) for each simulated population were determined to ensure a similar distribution of founding population sizes as observed experimentally. GR values were then calculated for each pairwise comparison of the 500 simulated populations (n = 124,750 comparisons, Supplementary Fig. 7b\u2013e) as described above. Simulated Nb\u2032 values ranged from 1 to 209 and GR values ranged from 0.13 to 0.34 (Moderately Low). Simulations never produced the high-GR values we observed in our animal experiments (Supplementary Fig. 7).",

Given that barcode loss is stochastic and that the dominant barcodes found in individual organs are unique to each mouse, we determined inter-mouse (between mice) GR between organs at 14 and 24 hpi (Supplementary Fig. 4d). We defined \u201cModerately High\u201d GR by averaging both the inter-mouse (between mice) and intramouse (within a single mouse) GR values which yielded a value of 0.41 (Mod. High, values \u22650.41 and \u22640.88). The populations of PA in organs between mice (inter-mouse) were the least likely to be related (the lowest GR values) so we averaged these least-related organs (intermouse LG, LV, ST, GB, IN, CM, CO, FE at 14 and 24 hpi) to define the \u201cLow\u201d GR threshold as \u22640.17. The inter-mouse spleen GR values were specifically excluded from this calculation because they displayed Moderately High (14 hpi) and Moderately Mow (24 hpi) GR, respectively, likely secondary to the presence of large numbers of diverse barcodes in this organ (Supplementary Fig. 4d).",
