Since 2003, no US state has added or broadened non-medical exemptions and twelve states have since repealed or restricted nonmedical exemptions. 7 In 2019 alone, Maine and New York eliminated non-medical exemptions, Washington repealed personal belief exemptions for the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and seven more state legislatures introduced bills to eliminate non-medical vaccine exemptions. 7 Simultaneously, public health officials have proposed novel communication slogans -such as \"Safe Vaccinations for a Healthy Nation\" -to educate Americans about vaccines, 8 with researchers suggesting novel public health partnerships with diverse stakeholders, such as clergy. 9 Unfortunately, legislative actions meant to raise vaccination rates have been slowed or even doomed by coordinated anti-vaccine opposition and skepticism about institutional intrusion into family life. 10 Public health interventions are well-intended, but they may fail to boost vaccination rates among the vaccine-hesitant and even decrease vaccination intentions. 11 Even a global pandemic that has overwhelmingly sickened and killed frail, vulnerable, and disadvantaged people may not be transforming hesitancy into trust among vaccination skeptics.",

Some providers, understandably frustrated and tired of parental pushback, are refusing to care for families who forgo vaccines. In national surveys of pediatricians in 2012 and 2013, 12-21% of pediatricians reported always or often dismissing families who refused vaccines from their practice, with rates rising over time. 14, 15 This is occurring even though many have argued strongly against the widespread adoption of this practice on ethical, legal, and public health grounds in the U.S. and Canada. [16] [17] [18] [19] In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) Report \"Countering Vaccine Hesitancy\" characterized dismissal as acceptable only after careful consideration of the situation, transparency with parents about the risks to their child, and openness about practice policies. 20 Although we are unaware of any recent studies measuring practice dismissal, pediatricians' willingness to embrace dismissal may be increasing after the 2019 measles epidemic. Recently, one pediatrician in a high-refusal setting encouraged colleagues to engage vaccine hesitant families through multiple strategies of non-violent resistance, including dismissal. \"So far,\" he said, \"punishing kids by practice exclusion for their parents' folly has been limited nationally, but may need to be more formally included in the strategy of all physicians.\" 21 Dismissal policies likely will create more problems than they solve. First, it is unclear where children go after dismissal, especially given the shortage of primary care providers in North America. 19, 20 Second, practice dismissal may paradoxically increase the risk of outbreaks.",

In 2013, researchers in Seattle videotaped over 100 encounters between physicians and parents, of which 50% were vaccine-hesitant, in order to determine what predicted vaccine uptake at the end of the visit. 24 They found that how we begin the conversation matters. Some physicians began the conversation with what the authors called a participatory approach, offering parents latitude over vaccination decisions with opening lines such as: \"What do you think about doing some shots today?\" Others presumed that parents intended to vaccinate their children, using phrases such as \"Johnnie is due for his 2-month vaccines today.\" When physicians used a presumptive approach, 74% of parents accepted vaccines; conversely, when physicians used a participatory approach, 83% of parents resisted vaccines. 24 By emphasizing vaccination as the social norm, a presumptive approach helps parents draw confidence from provider confidence as they face the decision of vaccination. Its benefits accrue with use. A longitudinal study of 73 parent-child dyads found child immunization status at 8 months was associated with the number of presumptive discussions parents had with providers at 2, 4, and 6 month well-child visits. 25 A presumptive approach also may increase adolescent vaccination uptake. A multi-arm randomized trial in 30 pediatric and family medicine clinics across North Carolina found a 5.4% increase (95% CI; 1.1%-9.7%) in HPV vaccination coverage for patients in clinics whose providers received presumptive training, compared with conversation training or usual care. 26 One can imagine similar successes in alternative contexts (e.g. hospital care units, emergency departments, or subspecialty clinics) and with different vaccines.

Second, if patients or parents resist a presumptive approach, we should engage them with motivational interviewing. Instead of a paternalistic approach which compels parents to vaccinate because \"the doctor said so,\" motivational interviewing guides conversations in a noncondescending manner so that parents gradually develop their own commitment to follow vaccine recommendations. The spirit of motivational interviewing has four components, easily remembered with the acronym PACE: Partnership, Acceptance, Compassion, and Evocation. 29 The Table provides conceptual demonstrated that a presumptive approach with motivational interviewing increased human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation for adolescents 13-17 years old by 9%, compared with a 3% decrease in controls. 30 Providers believed that motivational interviewing was useful; 86% of providers reported using the technique frequently, much more so than websites, decision-aids, or disease images. 31 A multi-site clinical trial to train providers on how to Presumptively Initiate Vaccines and Optimize Talk with Motivational Interviewing (PIVOT with MI) is ongoing. 32 Given its perceived utility and effectiveness, motivational interviewing may even counter clinician burnout. In a pilot study of the impact of motivational interviewing on obesity-related patient encounters, clinicians who received training had notable improvements in their burnout scores, compared with controls. 33 In sum, both parental confidence and physician wellbeing may improve as we work with vaccine hesitant parents via motivational interviewing.",

In the longitudinal study cited above, persistent use of the presumptive approach at 2-, 4-, and 6month well child visits was associated with a ~35% decrease in a child's percentage of days under-immunized at 8 months. 25 In another longitudinal study of nearly 500 parents who had ever declined HPV vaccination for their 11-17 year old child, researchers found that secondary acceptance of the HPV vaccine -within 12 months of an initial refusal -was associated with receiving follow-up counseling (OR 2.16; 95% CI, 1.42-3.28). 35 When asked why they ultimately accepted the HPV vaccine for their child, one-third of parents cited receiving a second recommendation. 35 We believe persistence will pay off with other vaccines as clinicians form long-term relationships with parents and children, understand their concerns, and recommend vaccines anew. Providers could also ask parents to sign a vaccine declination form, such as the one created by the AAP. 36 As of 2011, nearly half of pediatricians and one third of family medicine physicians used such forms when parents refused vaccines. 12 Although the use of a declination form has not been tested in a randomized trial, the use of such a form offers the opportunity to clearly delineate the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases, the importance of vaccines, and the responsibility parents have for the consequences of vaccine delay. Of course, we must discern the best time and context in which to introduce a declination form, but doing so may motivate parents on the fence to accept recommendations from their persistent providers.",

Practice dismissal may be a tempting option for burnt-out physicians to avoid hesitant parents and the public health risks their children pose to other patients. Yet, as SARS-CoV-2 circles the globe and researchers race to develop a vaccine, we can develop, in parallel, our ability to talk about vaccines with concerned parents. Evidence-based alternatives to dismissal exist, increase parental acceptance of vaccines, will keep under-vaccinated and unvaccinated children with pediatricians, and improve population health. As policymakers and public health experts work at system levels, we should consider what we as pediatricians might do to increase vaccine confidence. Who else is better positioned to do so than the pediatricians who form long-term relationships with parents and their children? Contentious conversations require care, but we believe evidence-based tools that teach a Presumptive Approach, Motivational Interviewing, and Persistence can help. As we work as pediatricians to improve the state of vaccine confidence, let us consider caring for vaccine-hesitant families, one visit at a time. ",
