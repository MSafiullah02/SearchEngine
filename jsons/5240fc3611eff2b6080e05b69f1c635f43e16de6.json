The peptide is derived from the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein positions [362] [363] [364] [365] [366] [367] [368] [369] [370] ). It is conserved in all known isolates of SARS-CoV and has been verified by in vitro peptide-binding studies to be a good to intermediate binder to HLA-A*0301 and HLA-A*1101, with IC 50 values of 70 and 186 nM, respectively , Tissue Antigens, 63, 395-400]. In terms of the residues lining the peptide-binding groove, the HLA-A*1101-SNP 362-370 complex is very similar to other known structures of HLA-A*1101 and HLA-A*6801. The SNP 362-370 peptide is held in place by 17 hydrogen bonds to the -chain residues and by nine water molecules which are also tightly bound in the peptide-binding groove. Thr6 of the peptide (Thr6p) does not make efficient use of the middle (E) pocket. For vaccine development, there seems to be a potential for optimization targeted at this position. All residues except Thr2p and Lys9p are accessible for T-cell recognition.",

            "text": "MHC-I molecules consist of three chains: the polymorphic transmembrane -chain (365 amino acids), the monomorphic -chain ( 2 m, 99 amino acids) and a peptide of 8-11 aminoacid residues. Assembly of the complexes takes place in the ER, where the process is controlled by a number of chaperones and the TAP peptide transporter (Cresswell, 2000) . The extracellular part of MHC-I molecules has a very characteristic structure. The membrane-proximal 2 m/ 3 immunoglobulin domains serve as a rigid support for the membranedistal 1 / 2 -domains consisting of two -helices on top of a -sheet. Here, peptides are bound to MHC-I molecules between the two -helices through interactions with polymorphic as well as conserved residues in the -helices and the -sheet floor. Several invariant interactions with the peptide backbone, especially the N-and C-terminus, stabilize the peptide-MHC-I complex (Bjorkman et al., 1987) , but the ultimate determinant of the half-life of MHC-I complexes seems to be sequence-dependent interactions with the socalled specificity pockets in the groove. The peptide-binding groove is conventionally subdivided into six such specificity pockets named A to F (Garrett et al., 1989) . Each pocket can accommodate the side chain of one or a few closely related amino-acid residues, thus determining the peptide-specificity of the MHC-I molecule. The peptide residues preferred by a given MHC-I molecule constitute what is known as a sequence motif. Variation in the pool of bound peptides not defined by sequence motifs includes attachment of non-peptide groups to peptides (Otvos et al., 1996; Speir et al., 1999) as well as binding of extended or shortened peptides (Stryhn et al., 2000) . Currently, about 70% of all peptides binding to a given MHC-I molecule can be identified using extended motif definitions (Kast et al., 1994) .",

It is known to be important in the control of HIV (Culmann et al., 1991; Johnson & Walker, 1991; Walker et al., 1989) , EBV and HBV infections (Achour et al., 1986) . A11 belongs to the A3 supertype, which is the second most common supertype; at least 44% of the world population carry A3 supertype MHC-I molecules (Sette & Sidney, 1999) . A3 supertype molecules are characterized by a preference for small and/or hydrophobic residues in the second position of the peptide and arginine or lysine at the C-terminus (Sidney et al., 1996) . Specifically, A11 preferentially binds peptides with isoleucine, threonine or valine in position 2 and a C-terminal lysine or arginine residue (Falk et al., 1994; Gavioli et al., 1995; Kubo et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1993) . Structures of MHC-I molecules belonging to the A3 supertype improve our understanding of peptide binding to these molecules. Furthermore, such models will enable the construction of reliable A3 supertype homology models with any desired peptide, an approach which promises to become a useful way of predicting peptide-MHC-I affinities in the near future (Flower et al., 2003; Logean et al., 2001; Rognan et al., 1999; Schueler-Furman et al., 2000) .",

At the beginning of 2003, a large number of cases appeared and SARS quickly spread to more than 30 countries all over the world. By March 2003, the causative agent had been identified as a novel member of the coronavirus family (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus). This class of viruses is responsible for up to 30% of all mild upper respiratory tract illnesses in humans (Siddell, 1995) . To date, over 8400 cases of SARS CoV-infected patients have been identified worldwide. Approximately 10% of all infected individuals died from progressive respiratory failure (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003) and in elderly people the mortality was as high as 55%. Since the initial outbreak, the number of reported cases has dropped significantly; however, SARS-CoV is far from eradicated. Of special concern is the existence of SARS-CoV in several non-human species. Indeed, evidence suggests a non-human origin of SARS-CoV (reviewed in Poon et al., 2004) . The consequences of a worldwide SARS pandemic are grim and the World Health Organization still considers the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV to be of great importance.",

Furthermore, the N protein has been shown to induce actin rearrangement and apoptosis in cells under stress (Surjit, Liu, Jameel et al., 2004) . A highly basic sequence unique to SARS-CoV in the C-terminal part of the protein (residues 362-381, KTFPPTEPKKDKKKKTDEAQ) resembles a nuclear localization signal (Marra et al., 2003) . Although its function remains unknown, the high pI of the peptide suggests binding to RNA.

These minor variations reflect the inherent flexibility of MHC-I molecules as well as differences in crystal packing. Despite differences in the identity of the bound peptide, most residues lining the peptide-binding groove are in almost identical positions (Fig. 2) . The only differences are seen at the edge of the binding groove, where side chains from the peptide allow different sets of interactions with otherwise solvent-exposed residues of the -chain. However, the contribution of these mainly polar interactions to the peptide binding is probably negligible, as they are easily replaced with solvent interactions. Minor local displacements of the 1 and 2 helices caused by the peptide can also be discerned and are of the order of 0.5-1.0 \u00c5 . These displacements centre on the middle part of the 1 helix (B/C pockets) and the N-terminal half of the 2 helix (D/E pockets).",

Those residues in the binding groove that differ between the two alleles (A11$A68: Q62R, E63N, I97M, A152V, Q156W, R163T) occupy approximately the same space. The only significant difference is found at the bottom of the central part of the binding groove, where A68 residues Met97 and Trp156, which are sitting opposite each other, are more bulky than the corresponding A11 residues Ile97 and Gln156. The A11$A68 change in position 156 to a less polar environment (Q$W) in addition to the increase in size makes the outermost part of the side chain of the shared Arg114 flip over, which in turn forces the side chain of Asp116 to adopt another conformation. These differences affect the shape and charge geometry at the bottom of the peptide-binding groove (F pocket) and might explain why A68 has a slight preference for arginine over lysine at the peptide C-terminal end, while the opposite is true for A11 (see the SYFPEITHI database at http://www.syfpeithi.de/; Rammensee et al., 1999) . The long side chain of an arginine residue requires a deeper and wider pocket in order to maintain the conserved network of hydrogen bonds surrounding the peptide C-terminus and this is achieved by substituting Ile97 in A11 with methionine in A68. Although other residue differences do exist between A11 and A68 in the 1 2 region, they are all found on the outside far away from the peptide and are not likely to be important for peptide binding.",

Variations in length are accommodated in the central part of the peptide-binding groove where the peptide adjusts itself to allow optimal interactions between the primary anchor residues (P 2 and P C for the A3 supertype) and the corresponding peptide-binding pockets (B and F, respectively). Short peptides (octamer) optimize their interactions with the B and F pockets by adopting an extended conformation (Reiser et al., 2000 (Reiser et al., , 2002 compared with nonamer or decamer peptides, which adopt various forms of bulging or zigzagging conformations in the central part of the groove (Hillig et al., 2001) . The straight conformation tends to place the octameric peptides deeper in the groove. Thus, owing to steric interference caused by Met97 and Trp156 at the floor of the peptide-binding groove, A68 would be expected to have a stronger preference for nonamers or decamers than A11. The set of A11 and A68 example peptides in the SYFPEITHI database confirms this tendency (Rammensee et al., 1999) . The other members of the A3 supertype would be expected to have the same preferences as A11 as they all (A3, A31 and A33) have a leucine residue in position 156 and either isoleucine (A3 and A11) or methionine (A31 and A33) in position 97.

The architecture of the entrance to the B pocket seems uniquely suited to accommodate amino-acid residues branched at C . Indeed, A11 prefers peptides with isoleucine, valine and threonine in the second position (Gavioli et al., 1995) , but other aliphatic residues such as methionine, leucine, alanine and serine are also accepted (Falk et al., 1994; Sidney et al., 1996) . Met45 and Val67 define the bottom of the B pocket and since Thr2p does not fill the pocket entirely, these residues would have to rearrange slightly to accommodate larger side chains. Opposite the B pocket, Thr2p rests against Tyr159 and forms a hydrogen bond to the Arg163 side chain via the carbonyl group.

W19 and W121 are further bound to the side chain of Asp74 and the carbonyl group of Ala117, respectively. Finally, the aliphatic part of Lys9p makes vdW interactions with Asp77, Leu81, Ile95, Tyr123 and Trp147. Interestingly, the C \" -N part is the most flexible part of Lys9p (C \" , 22.7 \u00c5 2 ; N , 22.3 \u00c5 2 ; the remainder, 12-15 \u00c5 2 ), despite the large number of interactions holding the side chain. This is also evident from a slight fanlike smearing of the corresponding electron density.",

However, the side chains of Phe3p and Thr6p are so deeply placed in the binding groove that their interaction with the T-cell receptor (TCR) might be limited. The residues in those positions could likely be optimized for A11 binding without severely affecting TCR binding. The large number of proline residues is probably responsible for the intermediate affinity of the SNP 362-370 peptide for two reasons. Firstly, they do not contribute any significant hydrogen bonds in the peptide-binding groove. Rather, water molecules are present in the central part of the binding groove to satisfy the polar residues. Secondly, they restrict the flexibility of the peptide, thereby preventing optimization of interactions with the binding groove. This is evident from the increased mobility of the Lys9p side chain, which is usually the most tightly bound part of the peptide (Li & Bouvier, 2004) . In this case, however, the proline residues cannot be exchanged, since they are all solventexposed and therefore expected to interact directly with the TCR.",

In addition to MHC-I binding, peptides were selected such that they had a high probability for being generated by proteasomal processing and subsequently translocated into the ER by TAP. The predicted peptides were tested for MHC-I binding in a biochemical binding assay. From this set of verified binders, we selected a peptide with the sequence KTFPPTEPK (the SNP 362-370 peptide) corresponding to a conserved putative nuclear localization signal (see above). This peptide has an IC 50 ($K d ) value of 70 nM for binding to HLA-A*1101 and 186 nM for binding to HLA-A*0301, placing it in the range of intermediate MHC-I binders. As the SNP 362-370 peptide is part of a SARS-specific sequence from the N protein which seems to be involved in several functions, it is likely that it is and will remain well conserved among different SARS-CoV strains. Therefore, the SNP 362-370 peptide is a potential candidate for inclusion in a peptide-based vaccine against SARS.",

Previously published structures of A11 (Li & Bouvier, 2004) and A68 (Collins et al., 1995) have suggested the use of additional anchor residues in the P C-3 position, resulting in a double-bulge conformation of the Peptide-binding pockets shown in stereo. The SNP 362-370 peptide is shown in red, the -chain in blue and water molecules involved in peptide binding in purple. Hydrogen bonds between the peptide and the -chain are shown as dashed orange lines, while hydrogen bonds involving water molecules are green. The central part of the peptide is highlighted in bold stick representation in each panel. central part of the peptide (see Fig. 3 ). In the A11-SNP 362-370 complex, Thr6p does not make efficient use of this middle (E) pocket and hence there seems to be a potential for optimization targeted at the P 6 position. Ideally, Thr6p should be replaced by a residue which could displace loosely bound water molecules in the groove and make direct contacts with residues lining the D pocket.",

            "text": "The Human MHC Project (Buus, 1999) is an effort to design peptide-based vaccines against any pathogen by means of a complete mapping of MHC-based immune reactivity. As direct screening of every allele is an insurmountable task, there is a need for alternative methods to extend our current knowledge. A promising strategy involves the use of known MHC-I structures as templates for modelling of any desired peptide-MHC-I complex followed by estimation of the interaction energy (i.e. affinity) for the complex (Flower et al., 2003) . An encouraging fact in this context is the observation of the structural invariance of the peptide-binding groove within a supertype. Although the bound peptides are very different, the A11-SNP 362-370 complex is very similar to the other two A11 structures in terms of positions of the residues lining the peptide-binding groove. Even A68 is so similar that it should be possible to model it (and presumably A03, A31 and A33 as well) reliably based on the A11 structures. Extrapolating this to the other MHC-I supertypes means that a few well determined structures belonging to each supertype should suffice as a reliable basis for the modelling of any desired MHC-Ipeptide complex. The A11-SNP 362-370 complex structure presented here adds to this expanding list of MHC-I template structures, which hold the information necessary for a direct structural approach to peptide-based vaccine design.

The surface is drawn with a 1.4 \u00c5 probe over the -chain without water molecules. Water molecules involved in peptide binding are shown in purple. Notice the prominent proline residues in the peptide. All residues except Thr2p and Lys9p are accessible for direct interaction with the TCR.",
