The initial symptoms of most patients are fever, dry cough, and fatigue, then they developed into dyspnea quickly, even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(Chen et al., 2020a, Huang et al., 2020). The Chinese center for disease control and prevention (CDC) promptly dispatched a team to assist local health authorities in Wuhan to carry out investigations on December 31, 2019. The Chinese CDC obtained lower respiratory tract samples, which were called bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, from patients of unknown etiology pneumonia in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. By whole-genome sequencing, real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and culture of the virus, we recognized that this is a new coronavirus, which is different from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (Zhu et al.,2020).",

Anhui province, which borders Hubei province, is also a major province for migrant workers, many of whom work in Wuhan and other provinces in Hubei. As Chinese Spring Festival drawing near, 4.3 million people travelled out of Wuhan to other cities in China between 11 January and 23 January (Tian et al.,2020), a lot of whom were migrant workers and college students returned from Wuhan. It provided a shortcut for the virus spreading. On February 7, 2020, National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic China temporarily named the pneumonia infected by the new coronavirus as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia(General Office of National Health Commission,2020). On February 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) named it coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) officially.",

Despite a phased victory in the fight against the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, the situation outside China has become serious, more than 160 countries in six continents had reported cases of COVID-19. It is frightening that the number of confirmed cases outside China continued to rise, with a cumulative total of more than 200,000, of which Italy, Spanish, Germany and the United States of America were seriously affected(World Health Organization (2020)). At present, COVID-19 is not only a matter of China, it has become a threat to the health of people around the world.

The majority of patients had iterleukin-6 (IL-6) and serum amyloid protein A (SAA) above the normal range.118 patients were tested for nine respiratory pathogens, 40 of whom showed positive or weak positive IgM for mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). Only one patient showed positive IgM for adenovirus (ADV) and influenza virus A/B (INFA/B), but had a negative result in the nucleic acid detection of INFA/B. All patients underwent chest CT examination. 100(80.0%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, with 26(20.8%) patients showing multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. Five (4.0%) patients presented with no abnormality in chest CT (Table 3).",

Recent study has shown that elevated IL-6 may be associated with poor prognosis (Chen et al. 2020b). It is well known that cytokines play an important role in viral infection. In addition, relevant study has shown that the cytokines in severe infected patients are significantly increased, which can be used to reflect the severity of disease (La Gruta et al.,2007). Furthermore, CRP and SAA are biomarkers reflecting inflammation. Elevated CRP and SAA are more common in critical patients, who had a higher level than non-critical patients, which tells that there is a severe inflammatory response in critically ill patient. A study of dead cases with COVID-19 also suggested that the high level of CRP and SAA may be related to a poor prognosis (Li et al.,2020). In our study, none of patients died.

            "text": "Based on the study to SARS and MERS, there is no specific treatment to coronavirus infection currently (Arabi et al.,2020), in addition to supportive therapy. In this study, all patients received antiviral therapy. The most commonly drug is kaletra, which was found to reduce viral loads and improve clinical symptoms during the treatment in a study (Lim et al.,2020). But randomized controlled clinical trials are required to further confirm the clinical efficacy of kaletra. Moreover, it is still controversial about corticosteroid treatment. There are several critical patients in this study, who were given to corticosteroid treatment based on the diagnostic and treatment protocol for COVID-19 (version 5)(General Office of National Health Commission, General Office of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2020). However, the available clinical evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of COVID-19(World Health Organization, 2020, Russell et al., 2020). A retrospective study on critically ill patients with MERS found that the use of glucocorticoids did not reduce fatality rate within 90 days. Conversely, it may delay the clearance of viral RNA in respiratory tract (Arabi et al.,2018). Other studies suggested that corticosteroid treatment may lead to other related side effects, such as diabetes, psychosis, avascular necrosis and increase the risk of secondary infection of patients with respiratory viral infection(Lee, 2004, Ni et al., 2019, Li et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2004). Therefore, it should be cautious about using glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19. The cumulative cured cases of the COVID-19 have reached more than 10,000 in China by Feb 18, 2020. Plasma from convalescent patients may be a safe and effective treatment. A meta-analysis suggests that plasma therapy may reduce mortality of severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology (Mair-Jenkins et al.,2014).",

Respiratory failure was the cause of most deaths (Li et al., 2020), so respiratory support plays an important role in the treatment of COVID-19. From this case of Patient 118, we wanted to explore why a young woman without underlying disease infected SARS-CoV-2 developed into ARDS. Correlational studies suggests that the time from onset to ARDS is 8 days (Wang et al.,2020). In this case, the time from onset to admission was 10 days, at the time she had developed into ARDS. Therefore, we inferred that delayed admission may have contributed to her critical condition. In addition, even critical patients may be cured and discharged after aggressive treatment.",
