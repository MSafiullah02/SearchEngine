This made our patient a good candidate for mechanical support devices which are dependent on venous or ventricular drainage. Importantly, as the ARDS still persists, the prognosis is now driven by the potential pulmonary recovery. We do not have sufficient data on this very sick patient collective in order safely estimate prognosis. At least in our patient, the shock could be overcome using a combination of two mechanical support devices. This case might encourage the community in preparing for extracorporeal treatment in COVID-19 patients4 as well as sharing all data, for example, in the registry of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization.",
