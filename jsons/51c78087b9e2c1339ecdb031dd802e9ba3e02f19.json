Consequently, there is a growing concern over human exposure to enteric viruses through contaminated food products. Data on viral foodborne diseases are still fragmented, and epidemiological studies have focused either on particular countries or on particular pathogens. In the last decade, epidemiological reports indicate that enteric viruses, in particular human noroviruses (NoV), which cause acute gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A virus (HAV), are the leading cause of foodborne illness in developed countries (Koopmans and Duizer 2004 ; EFSA 2015 ) .

Numerous physical, chemical, and biological factors infl uence virus persistence in the environment (Table 13 .2 ). Some of the primary factors affecting the survival of viruses in liquid environmental matrices are temperature, ionic strength, chemical constituents, microbial antagonism, the sorption status of the virus, and the type of virus. Considerable differences have been observed in the survival of enteric viruses in different types of environmental and food samples. Different behaviors and inactivation rates have been observed not only among viruses of different families and genera, but also among viruses of the same family, genus, and even among similar types or strains of virus. Among the chemical constituents of liquid or semisolid (feces, human night soil, biosolids, and animal manures, etc.) environmental matrices, the amount and type of organic matter and specifi c antiviral chemicals (such as ammonia at elevated pH levels or natural antimicrobial compounds of fruits) play a role in virus stability. Of the physical factors infl uencing virus persistence in liquid media, temperature, sunlight, and virus association with solids are among the most important. Soil moisture, temperature, sunlight, and other soil characteristics may infl uence the persistence of viruses in soil. On inanimate surfaces (or fomites), the most important factors that affect virus stability are the type of virus and surface, relative humidity, moisture content, temperature, composition of the suspending medium, light exposure, and presence of antiviral chemical or biological agents.

When the soil is saturated, all pores are fi lled with water, which allows faster virus transport through the soil because virus contact with the soil has been diminished. When the fl ow is unsaturated, the viruses are in closer contact with the soil, thus promoting virus adsorption to the soil (Santamar\u00eda and Toranzos 2003 ) . Goyal and Gerba ( 1979 ) considered soil pH as the single most important factor infl uencing viral adsorption, although the combined effect of organic matter and clay content, and cation-exchange capacity, could surpass the sole soil pH effect. At ambient conditions, viruses are usually negatively charged, thus being attracted to and entrapped by positively charged material in soil (Sobsey et al. 1980 ) . In neutral and alkaline soil situations, viruses will not bind to any particulate matter and will be allowed to move freely in soil. There are, however, many exceptions to these general rules. Virus absorption to soil is also affected by cation concentrations. Cations favor virus adsorption to soil by reducing their repulsive forces. Sewage wastes provide an environment that enhances virus retention to soil, while this retention would be low in distilled water. As a matter of fact, distilled water may actually lead to the elution of viruses from soils, favoring virus mobilization and transport through soil. On the other hand, soluble organic matter will compete with the virus for soil adsorption sites. Likewise, humic and fulvic acids will also compete with the virus and will reduce the level of adsorption of viruses to the soil (Sobsey and Hickey 1985 ) . Wei et al.
