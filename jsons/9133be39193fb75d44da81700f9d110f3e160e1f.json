In particular, the extended roles of the gate electrode of BioFETs as the probing surface are highlighted, in comparison with the conventional gate electrode, together with the physical and biological processes for detecting target molecules. Moreover, the bottom-up syntheses of vertical and horizontal nanowires are presented and the ensuing nanowires are characterized. Also, the top-down and bottom-up approaches for processing nanowires are compared by taking as criteria the process complexity and quality of the nanowires produced. Finally, the future prospects of bio-sensing are presented.",

            "text": "The sensor is the critical component of the system discussed above and may typically work based on a ''lock and key'' approach. Alternatively known as the affinity-based approach, it involves choosing a probe a priori that is designed to bind selectively to the target of interest [1] . The probe can be of any type including DNA, RNA, antibody, aptamer and others. The binding event manifests as a change in some measurable property of the surface supporting it. For example, a cantilever may show different bending levels for the bare cantilever, after functionalization with the probe, and following the probe-target hybridization. Optical techniques include monitoring the fluorescence or surface plasmon resonance. One of the most common methods is to measure current or voltage from an electrode. Aside from electrochemical measurements [2, 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] involving cyclovoltammetry, amperometry and impedance spectroscopy, electrical transduction also includes monitoring the change in current-voltage characteristics of a field effect transistor (FET) appropriately treated with the biological probes [5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .

In the bottom-up preparation of nanowires also, the same precursors or source gases are used at more or less the same processing conditions as in the case of thin film growth. Then, what makes nanowire growth possible? There must be a guiding force to form the cylindrically shaped nanowires. An obvious choice would be to use a preformed template with the desirable pore size that can guide the growth into cylindrical nanowires. Anodized alumina is the most commonly used template for this purpose, and a wide variety of nanowires have been successfully grown using this template. The disadvantage of this method is that the template itself needs to be removed prior to the use of the nanowires in device fabrication. Often the template removal is achieved through some acid treatment which may damage the nanowire and/or introduce defects.",

A laboratory VLS reactor is a quartz tube inserted into a two-zone furnace shown in Fig. 9 .2. The source vapor can be generated in any number of ways in the upstream zone depending on the desired material, as will be discussed shortly. The growth substrate consists of a catalyst, typically a thin metal layer (gold, In, Ga etc.) or mono-dispersed colloids of that metal, if readily available. The catalyst layer may be prepared either by sputtering or thermal evaporation. At the growth temperature, this thin layer breaks up into tiny droplets which remain in a molten state. The source vapor dissolves into the droplet and when supersaturation is reached, material begins to precipitate in the form of nanowires as shown in Fig. 9 .3. Invariably, the catalyst particle ends up at the top of the growing nanowire in the VLS process which allows easy removal through acid wash or chemical mechanical polishing of vertical nanowires during device processing.",

            "text": "In the case of silicon nanowires, silane (or SiCl 4 ) diluted in H 2 may be used as feedstock as in the case of the corresponding thin film growth [31] [32] [33] [34] . For GaAs nanowires, (CH 3 ) 3 Ga/AsH 3 feedstock common in MOCVD may be used [31, 35, 36] . For most oxide nanowires, the common practice in VLS growth is sublimation of the corresponding high purity (99.999 % or higher) powder [31, 37, 38] . This sublimation approach also works well for a variety of tellurides, selenides and other materials as long as the high purity powder form of the source is available [39] [40] [41] [42] and the sublimation temperature is reasonable without the need for high temperature furnaces (over 1,000\u00b0C). It is possible to mix two or more source powders for growing ternary nanowires [43] (e.g., Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 ). Gold is the widely used catalyst in nanowire growth reported in the literature. Gold modulates carrier recombination in both n-and p-type silicon, since high-mobility interstitial gold atoms can transform into electrically active substitutional sites. Therefore, it is desirable to look for alternatives to gold. Fortunately, a wide variety of group III, IV, V, and VI metal elements have been found to be useful as catalyst except for Ir and Pt [44] . The only correlation appears to be the inverse dependence of nanowire growth density on the melting point of the catalyst metal. In this regard, indium (In) is a low-melting metal that is useful as a catalyst for the growth of Si and other nanowires, allowing growth zone temperature to be as low as 150\u00b0C [45] . Gallium also is another low-melting candidate (*450\u00b0C) suitable for nanowire growth [46] . Figure 9 .4 shows a random mat of silicon nanowires grown on a silicon substrate [32] . The diameter of the nanowire correlates reasonably with the catalyst particle diameter. The length of the nanowires is several microns which can be decreased by reducing the growth time. Figure 9 .5 shows vertically oriented silicon nanowires grown using a mixture of SiCl 4 /H 2 with diameter in the range of 40-80 nm and height 1-2 lm. Only a very narrow set of conditions using this feedgas system yield vertical nanowires in the case of silicon [32] . For example, SiCl 4 fractions greater than 0.25 % in H 2 and temperatures greater than 950\u00b0C yield thin and curvy wires. Similarly, a narrow set of conditions have been identified for growing vertical silicon nanowires using the silane/H 2 system as well [33] . The silicon nanowires can be doped with boron and phosphorous to obtain p-and n-type, respectively, as in the case of thin films [31] .",

It has been shown for a variety of different semiconductor nanowires that the bandgap increases with a decrease in diameter, particularly for sizes below the value of the corresponding Bohr radius. For example, a silicon nanowire of 1.3 nm in diameter exhibits a bandgap of 3.5 eV, substantially larger than the 1.1 eV for bulk silicon [47] . This allows bandgap engineering through control of the nanowire diameter. In spite of all the attractive features of the bottom-up technique, it is hard to use these structures in device fabrication in a straightforward manner. For example, attempting a ''pick and place'' approach using the random mat of nanowires seen in Fig. 9 .4 over thousands of pairs of source-drain terminals on a large wafer is a difficult task. Direct growth by catalyzed-CVD (i.e. VLS) on the prefabricated contacts for thousands of devices over a large wafer is not easy either. The vertical nanowires can be used to fabricate vertical surround gate transistors. In this configuration, the source will be at the bottom with the drain contact at the top; the gate wraps around the nanowire channel connecting the source and the drain. The report on such devices using SiNWs uses many nanowires under one gate [48] . A gate surrounding only a single nanowire was reported for ZnO transistor [49] . In any case, wafer-scale fabrication of vertical nanowire transistors has not been achieved yet.",

The In 2 O 3 NW-FET using nanowires modified with a fibronectin-based binding apent detected N-protein at subnanomolar concentrations.

A 6-inch silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate with 10 15 cm -3 boron doping was used. The 675-lm-thick substrate consists of 100-nm thick \\100[ oriented silicon layer and a 200-nm-thick buried oxide layer. The top Si layer was thinned to 40 nm using thermal oxidation at 900\u00b0C and wet etching of SiO 2 with diluted HF (1:1,000 with deionized water) to form the rectangular-shaped nanowires. The top Si layer, except the active region, was etched using an inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etcher (ICP-RIE) with a mixture of HBr and O 2 . After the device isolation process, nanowires of 50-nm width and 10 micron length were formed using electron-beam lithography and ICP-RIE. A 4-nm thick SiO 2 sacrificial oxide layer was grown using thermal oxidation at 900\u00b0C to protect the interface between the nanowire channel and gate oxide from the ion implant damage. Arsenic ion implantation was then done to form the source and drain ohmic contacts, and the implanted dopants were activated using rapid thermal annealing at 1,000\u00b0C for 25 s. The damaged sacrificial oxide was removed next by immersing in diluted HF solution and a 5-nm thick gate oxide was grown in a thermal furnace at 900\u00b0C. The source/drain contact pads and the gate electrodes (20-nm-thick Ti and 200-nm-thick Ag layers) were deposited using an electron-beam evaporator and patterned using conventional lithography and a lift-off process. Finally, the surface of the entire device, except for the active sensing region and the contact pads, was covered with a 2-mm-thick SU-8 layer to prevent leakage current between the contacts and the solution. The width, length, and height of the well holding the solution over the devices were 1,200, 1,200, and 2 lm, respectively. For the formation of integrated Ag/AgCl pseudo reference electrode, 30 lL of 0.1 M KCl was dropped on top of the embedded Ag electrode and a voltage of 1 V was applied for 300 s. Due to the reaction between silver and chloride ions, the Ag/AgCl pseudo reference electrode (RE) was successfully fabricated for use as a gate electrode of the SiNW ISFET.",

Nanostructures for enhanced sensitivity have been explored with carbon nanotubes and graphene as leading candidates. In this chapter, a detailed account on the use of silicon nanowires in BioFETs has been presented. Both bottom-up and top-down approaches for the preparation of SiNWs have been discussed. The device fabrication details differ significantly between the two methods. The constraint today on the bottom-up SiNW synthesis techniques includes the lack of amenability for wafer scale fabrication. It is not possible to precisely grow nanowires (of chosen diameter and length) between each pair of source and drain over a 200 or 300 mm wafer. ''Pick and place'' approaches from bulk samples are unlikely to lead to large scale production either. As of now, there have been no credible routes to large scale device fabrication using bottom-up techniques.",

Fully functional systems require integration of microfluidics (channels, valves etc.) on the same chip. Microfluidics is a well evolved field, especially on silicon platforms. Therefore, integration of the sensor, signal processing, and microfluidics for sample handling along with system packaging should not pose serious challenges.",

            "text": "Whether it is clinical diagnostics or any other applications mentioned earlier, the early use of the sensor systems may be in the laboratory setting where the labor hours on analytical tests can be drastically reduced. From then on, migration into field use is expected to follow; this can include at-home diagnostics of viruses and infectious diseases or routine health checkup functions, municipal water quality monitoring at designated sites, pollution monitoring in rivers and lakes etc. The platforms for such field-use are likely to be different from those in the laboratory or a central lab. In this regard, smart phones may play an important role in hosting the biosensor systems. Currently, smart phone-based gas/vapor and biosensors are being investigated in many academic and industrial laboratories across the world. It is entirely possible to integrate into a smart phone a chip consisting of an array of BioFETs, or equivalent devices, along with microfluidics capabilities with the goal of performing multiplexed operations. In a health-related application, disposal cartridges will have to be employed necessarily. Even the design of microfluidics in a smart phone environment may not be challenging. The true challenge is to eliminate the need for concentrating or purifying or any other type of time-consuming sample processing, and still delivering reliable and sensitive diagnostics.",
