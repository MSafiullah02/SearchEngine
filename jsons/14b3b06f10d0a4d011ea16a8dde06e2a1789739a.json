His body mass index was 27 kg/m 2 , C peptide 0.19 nmol/L, A1C 7.5% and he had striking hyperglycaemia with positive pancreatic antibodies confirming autoimmunity, so he was treated with insulin. Shortly thereafter, he started to use prophylactic chloroquine phosphate (500 mg once a week for 4 consecutive weeks) due to a trip to a malaria-endemic area and experienced hypoglycaemia following 2 weeks of therapy. Insulin was gradually reduced and eventually stopped. In the next years, he was able to keep his blood glucose optimal with dietary measures alone with A1C 6.2e6.9% (44e52 mg/mol), HOMA index 1,7; fasting C peptide was 0,74 nmol/ L, after a meal it was 1,2 nmol/L b-cell autoimmunity; however, persisted. In 2014, following a short febrile illness, his glucose levels rose and the insulin was reintroduced permanently. During his last evaluation in 2020, the fasting C peptide was 0.29 nmol/L, after a meal C peptide was 0.61 nmol/L confirming residual endogenous secretion of insulin, but A1C 9.2% (77 mmol/L).",

With the natural progression of T1DM, some patients regain transient b-cell activity which lasts in most cases a few weeks or months, or rarely, years. The factors that prolong partial recovery from an autoimmune attack are still unknown. Chloroquine, however, is known to reduce the incidence of diabetes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus and to improve glycaemia if diabetes is already present [2] . The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of chloroquine are possibly related to lysosomotropic and immunomodulatory mechanisms [3] , but chloroquine also causes changes in insulin metabolism through the signalling of cellular receptors and post-receptor clearance [4] . In diabetic animals, it has been shown that chloroquine raises serum insulin levels even without exogenous insulin treatment [5] .",
