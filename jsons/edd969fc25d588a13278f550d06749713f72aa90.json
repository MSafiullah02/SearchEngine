Viral infection begins with an initial attachment step, namely the binding of the virus to the respective host cell receptor. SarS-coV has been studied since the outbreak in 2002. it is well known that the virus enters cells through the binding of its spike protein receptor-binding domain (rBd) to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ace2). although the 2019-ncoV rBd has not yet been fully investigated, it shares same common characteristics with SarS-coV and it has the ability to bind to human ace2 (6) . ace2 receptors exist in a number of animals and this is the reason why inter-species contamination is possible. The efficiency of this binding depends on the affinity between the RBD of the virus and the species-specific ACE2. Although it is already known that rats and mice are not susceptible, the issue of covid-19 rBd recognition of ace2 of dogs remains unresolved.",

On February 27, a Pomeranian was tested as weak positive for covid-19 from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong (7) . it is believed that dog's infection was possibly due to transmission from his infected owner (a human-to-animal transmission). The dog remained under quarantine and samples taken on February 28 and on March 2, were again weak positive, confirming the case of infection (instead of just mouth and nose contamination from the household). The dog was asymptomatic during the whole period of infection. The AFCD of Hong Kong stated: 'Although there is no evidence yet that pets can transmit the virus to other pets or back to humans, we strongly advise that mammalian pets including dogs and cats from households with persons confirmed as infected with COVID-19 or as close contacts of COVID-19 infected persons should be put under quarantine in AFCD facilities to safeguard public and animal health. We will review this arrangement from time to time taking into account new information that becomes available' (7) .",

            "text": "american Veterinary Medical association mentions: 'This pet dog was one of two pet dogs under quarantine. The second pet dog had negative results of tests for the virus. Neither dog showed any signs of being ill with COVID-19. Unfortunately, the dog that tested positive passed away on March 16. The dog was 17 years old and had ongoing health issues that were likely responsible for the death of this dog, rather than COVID-19. We are told the second pet dog has been released from quarantine. On March 19, the AFCD reported that a third dog, a German Shepherd Dog living with an owner testing positive for COVID-19, had also tested positive. Another mixed-breed dog from the same residence tested negative. Neither dog has shown signs of disease. Both dogs are in quarantine and are continuing to be monitored and tested', 'To date, there have not been any reports of pets or other animals becoming ill, and there is no evidence that domestic animals, including pets, can spread SARS-CoV-2. Because the situation is ever-evolving, public and animal health officials may decide to test certain animals out of an abundance of caution. The decision to test will be made collaboratively between local, state, and federal animal and public health officials', 'After the decision is made to test, state animal health officials will designate a state-appointed veterinarian, USDA-accredited veterinarian, or foreign animal disease diagnostician to collect the sample using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and sample collection methods', 'While we are recommending these as good practices, it is important to remember that, to date, there have not been any reports of pets or other animals becoming ill with SARS-CoV-2, and there is currently no evidence that pets can spread COVID-19 to other animals, including people' (8). The World organisation for animal Health (WoaH) claimed: 'To date, there is no evidence that companion animals can spread the disease. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare. There is no evidence that dogs play a role in the spread of this human disease or that they become sick. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19 virus. The OIE will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available. However, because animals and people can sometimes share diseases (known as zoonotic diseases), it is still recommended that people who are sick with COVID-19 limit contact with companion and other animals until more information is known about the virus' (9). WHo stated there is no evidence to indicate that animals such as dogs or cats can be infected with the coronavirus. The italian Health Ministry (iHM) announced that: 'To date, there are neither evidences that animals, like dogs and cats, can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, nor that they can be a source of human infection', 'It cannot be excluded the dog was infected by its owner'. indeed, for reasons of precaution (10). cdc advise 'You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a facemask'. david Grimm, the online news editor of Science, interviewed Shelley rankin, a microbiologist at the university of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine (11). dr rankin mentioned: 'It was a single case, and we learned that we need to do a lot more research into the potential of the human SARS-CoV-19 virus to infect animals. That said, cats and dogs are mammals too. They have many of the same types of receptors on their cells that we do. So the virus could theoretically attach to these receptors. But will it enter their cells and replicate? Probably not. Still, people infected with SARS-CoV-19 should limit contact with their pets. Wash your hands, and don't let them lick you on the face. If the virus is in your secretions, and there's any potential of transmission, these are ways it could be transmitted'. Speaking for the need of testing pets she said: 'That's [not] everybody's top priority",
