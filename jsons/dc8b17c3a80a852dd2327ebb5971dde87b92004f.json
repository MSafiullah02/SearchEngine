Therapy is aiming at symptom regression, avoidance of complications, reduction in the number of disease-related absences in school or at work, increased cost-effectiveness and improved quality of life. The purpose of this part of the guideline is to provide clinicians in any setting with a clinically focused multi-disciplinary guidance through different conservative treatment options in order to reduce inappropriate variation in clinical care, improve clinical outcome and reduce harm. Surgical management in terms of intracapsular as well as extracapsular tonsillectomy (i.e. tonsillotomy) is the subject of part II of this guideline. To estimate the probability of tonsillitis caused by b-hemolytic streptococci, a diagnostic scoring system according to Centor or McIsaac is suggested. If therapy is considered, a positive score of C3 should lead to pharyngeal swab or rapid test or culture in order to identify b-hemolytic streptococci. Routinely performed blood tests for acute tonsillitis are not indicated. After acute streptococcal tonsillitis, there is no need to repeat a pharyngeal swab or any other routine blood tests, urine examinations or cardiological diagnostics such as ECG. The determination of the antistreptolysin O-titer (ASLO titer) and other antistreptococcal antibody titers do not have any value in relation to acute tonsillitis with or without pharyngitis and should not be performed. Firstline therapy of b-hemolytic streptococci consists of oral penicillin. Instead of phenoxymethylpenicillin-potassium (penicillin V potassium), also phenoxymethlpenicillin-benzathine with a clearly longer half-life can be used. Oral intake for 7 days of one of both the drugs is recommended. Alternative treatment with oral cephalosporins (e.g. cefadroxil, cefalexin) is indicated only in cases of penicillin failure, frequent recurrences, and whenever a more reliable eradication of b-hemolytic streptococci is desirable. In cases of allergy or incompatibility of penicillin, cephalosporins or macrolides (e.g. Erythromycin-estolate) are valuable alternatives.",

Also for the prevalence of recurrent acute tonsillitis in Germany, no significant statistics are available. In 2010, approximately 127,000 tonsillectomies including tonsillotomies were performed in Germany on an inpatient basis [1] .

The most important pathogens that cause bacterial tonsillitis are GABHS, i.e. Streptococcus pyogenes. The disease transmission generally occurs via droplet infection transmitted by other patients with acute GABHS tonsillitis, very rarely by asymptomatic carriers [5] . However, even autoinfection via the normal flora of the mouth and the pharynx is possible. Other pathogen reservoirs may be pets, farm animals, but also articles of daily use such as tooth brushes.

RAT may lead to fibrosis of the tonsils and to fixation of the tonsil in its bed via the mechanism of transmitting the inflammation to the peritonsillar tissue (''peritonsillitis''), which becomes clinically obvious because of the reduced mobility indicating RAT.

The formerly published guideline of the German Society of General and Family Medicine (DEGAM) on the topic of ''Sore Throat'' [7] and of the German Society of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery on the topic of ''Antibiotic Therapy of Infections of the Head and Neck'' [8] are currently under review and will be published in due course. The panel therefore refrained from an additional literature review concerning diagnostics and conservative therapy of tonsillitis. Instead, the validity of several recommendations was checked whenever needed and the relevant literature cited and briefly summarized. The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with a consented interdisciplinary guidance to the different conservative and surgical treatment options.

The guideline was developed according to the protocol of the National Working Group of Medical Societies (AWMF, Arbeitsgemeinschaft Wissenschaftlicher Medizinischer Fachgesellschaften) and the National Medical Quality Center (AZQ, \u00c4 rztliches Zentrum f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4t) [9] . The panel used an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements supported by the relevant literature. Every change of the initial document was distributed among the panelists and archived step-by-step by the first author (JPW). Potential conflicts of interest were compiled for all panel members, discussed and finally disclosed. All recommendations and statements were consented by means of Delphi procedure or in the context of a consensus conference using a formal consensus procedure (nominal group process). First, the evidence situation was described from an expert point of view with subsequent discussion. According to the distributed handouts, the recommendation drafts were submitted to be reviewed by each panelist and dissenting proposals were noted. In all of the following statements and recommendations, a 100 % consensus was achieved (4/4). For standardization of the recommendations of the guideline, a consistent formulation was used. Based on the recommendations of the AWMF, the literature used for this guideline was not consequently classified according to the levels of evidence and no recommendations according to GRADE were stated. The present guideline applied the criteria mentioned in ''The Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence'' that were published by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) in 1998 [10] . During the 10 months devoted to guideline development ending in September 2015, the group met three times with monthly electronic review and feedback on each guideline draft to ensure accuracy and full transparency. The final version of the guideline was distributed to each of the involved societies and responses incorporated into the guideline. The final version was submitted to the AWMF for publication. A review process is scheduled for 2019 or sooner if significant evidence warrants earlier re-consideration.",

In children, Adenovirus 1-7, 7a, 9, 14, and 15; Influenza-Virus A and B; Parainfluenza-Virus 1-4; Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV), Human-Herpes-Virus 4 (HHV4), and Enteroviruses including Coxsackie-Viruses are most commonly involved, less frequently rhinoviruses or the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [18] . In adults, up to 50 % of especially mild forms of tonsillitis are caused by Rhinoviruses or Coronaviruses [18] . In particular Adenoviruses may cause relevant tonsillitis with even purulent exudation [16] . In some cases of tonsillitis, adenoviruses are detected together with GABHS [18] , suggesting GABHS colonization. Rare pathogens causing tonsillitis are the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the Human-Immunodeficiency-Virus (HIV). EBV tonsillitis is somewhat exceptional due to a potential involvement of the liver and spleen (Pfeiffer's disease; infectious mononucleosis, IM) [19] . More rarely, a primary CMV infection manifests with IM (see also ICD10 B27.1). GABHS, i.e. Streptococcus pyogenes, are the most common bacterial origin of tonsillo-pharyngitis in immunocompetent children (20-30 %) and adults (5-15 %). The infection occurs with a peak at the age of 3-14 years [18] which is mirrored by clinical scores [20, 21] . The value of a proven b-hemolytic group C or G streptococci infection compares clinically to a proven GABHS infection [22, 23] . Streptococci of group C and G have some virulence factors in common with GABHS, such as for example the M protein [24, 25] . The M protein is one of the main virulence factors of GABHS; different M protein subtypes are known to be associated with rheumatic fever [26, 27] . Studies from other countries with a high prevalence of rheumatic fever further indicate a certain association between other b-hemolytic streptococci of group C and G and an occurrence of streptococcal secondary disease [28, 29] .",

In addition to the majority of nonpathogenic Neisseria, rarely also Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococci) may trigger tonsillitis (especially in adults) [7] . In Germany, Neisseria meningitidis (meningococci) are detected as pharyngeal commensals in 10 % of the population [30] . The majority of the meningococcus strains has to be classified as non-pathogenic in healthy people [31] . Among anaerobes, Fusobacterium necrophorum plays an exceptional role and is isolated especially in patients suffering from an oropharyngeal infection with abscess formation and thrombosis of the internal jugular vein (Lemi\u00e8rr\u00e9s syndrome) [33] . A unilateral ulcer formation is reported in cases with a mixed infection with spirochaetes (Treponema vincentii and others) and fusobacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum and others). The findings in these cases of the so called Vincent\u00eds angina include a painfree unilateral gray-greenish tonsillar exudation associated with a significant cloaca-like halitosis and potentially cervico-buccal abscess development [34] . An extremely rare infection is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Patients present with a white-grayish pseudo-membranes which are not limited to the tonsils but involve the surrounding mucosa of the soft palate and pharynx. The mucosa is extremely vulnerable, bleeds easily and patients are threatened by acute upper airway obstruction [35, 36] . Among others, very rare pathogens causing tonsillitis are: Corynebacterium ulcerans, Corynebacterium/Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, Fancisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Treponema pallidum, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Chlamydia psittaci.",

Furthermore, parameters like the patients history, clinical symptoms, and laboratory values are required to distinguish between viral and bacterial origin of tonsillitis [7, 37] . It should be emphasized, that even positive results in laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP), serological parameters like positive anti-streptolysin-O titers (ASLO) or tonsil swabs (rapid antigen detection or microbiological culturing) do not prove a tonsillitis in asymptomatic patients [7, 37] . An asymptomatic person with microbiological proof of b-hemolytic streptococci in the pharyngeal swab is a so-called carrier of b-hemolytic streptococci [7, 37] . In contrast, the clinical diagnosis in symptomatic patients can be confirmed either by means of bacterial culture or rapid antigen detection [7], otherwise it remains only a clinical suspicion. The detection of bacterial commensals does not confirm a bacterial infection in symptomatic patients but suggests viral etiology [7]. Determination of ASLO values is not indicated to establish the diagnosis of tonsillitis (see below) [38] [39] [40] . The immune response against streptococci does not lead to a complete immune protection so that streptococcal infection might re-occur [5] . Reinfection means a new infection with the same streptococcus strain, which might even occur endogenously by persistence of the pathogens. An recurring infection with another streptococcus strain is defined as new infection of the same site. In most cases, it is transmitted exogenously by contact persons with acute tonsillo-(pharyngitis). In the light of this clinical guideline, a differentiation is irrelevant.",

It may occur even without tonsillitis, after TE, or even without exanthema. Since the differential diagnosis between scarlet fever and viral tonsillitis with exanthema plays a major role in primary medical consultation, for the diagnosis of scarlet fever at least one further criterion beside fever (and possibly tonsillitis) has to be fulfilled. In cases of scarlet types deviating from the classical course, a positive testing for streptococci is essential to at least confirm the presence of a suspected b-hemolytic streptococcal infection [42, 43] . The abrupt onset of scarlet fever is most commonly characterized by shivering, high fever, tachycardia, headaches, and short-time vomiting. The face is reddened with a pale triangle around the mouth. Almost regularly, sore throat, swallowing complaints, and cervical lymph node swellings are found. The tonsils may be significantly swollen and reddened but may also appear dotted with whitish or yellowish spots of pus, sometimes even confluent coatings are observed. The enanthema is limited to the soft palate. At the beginning, it is speckled and of bright red until it changes to a darker red color. Beside the typical bad breath, the tongue is first whitish coated (''white strawberry tongue'') until after some days the lingual papillae become clearly obvious (''red strawberry tongue''). The rash begins in the axillae and groin region followed by the chest, neck, and back and is sometimes itching. Finally the trunk and especially the inner surfaces of the extremities are involved. Palpation of the skin surface is comparable to sandpaper. The initially speckled, pale red rash turns red after 1-2 days and becomes confluent in many areas to a diffuse erythema with positive diascopy. Applying soft pressure to the red rash, white stripes appear for a short time. Petechias may also occur because of an increased capillary fragility. After 3-4 days, the exanthema is regressive in reverse sequence of its occurrence. The fever decreases with a slight delay. Often the scarlet exanthema is confluent, but may also present as a delimited picture. Only few patients present with small whitish to yellowish vesicles. They clearly contrast with the scarlet exanthema, dry out after some days and peel off. Desquamation starts in the face, at the auricles, axillae and groin region, followed by the palms, fingers, toes, and plantar skin. The process is limited most commonly to 4-6 weeks after onset of the disease onset, but may rarely last for some months [43] . Cases of scarlet fever resulting from wound infections as well as invasive infections caused by exotoxin-producing streptococci have been described [42] . In contrast to tonsillitis resulting from a local infection by streptococci, patients with scarlet fever typically present with a systemic immune response to the pyrogenic streptococcal exotoxins [41, 42] .",

The suspicion of EBV-associated IM generally results from the classical three symptoms of tonsillo-pharyngitis, fever, and cervical lymph node swellings which are found in 98 % of the patients. In contrast to streptococcal tonsillitis, rather extensive than speckled coatings are visible on the tonsillar surface. Furthermore, lymph node swellings are not only palpable in front of but also behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Other symptoms of IM occurring rather frequently are splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. The more rare symptoms are manifold and may present in nearly all organ systems. Among the possible acute complications of IM count e.g. airway obstruction due to tonsillar hyperplasia, rupture of the spleen, cytopenia, and neurological symptoms.",

Suggested by Centor et al. [50] as early as 1981, the Centor score is an appropriate screening method for acute tonsillitis but limited to patients of at least 15 years of age (Table 1 ). The modified Centor score, as suggested by McIsaac (Table 2) , corrects for age, and therefore can be used in adults as well as in children [20, 21] . Both tools were designed to estimate the probability that pharyngitis is of streptococcal origin, and to guide management [51] . Only in patients with a score of 3 and more (Centor or McIsaac), a rapid test or culture should be considered, if relevant. This is not suggested in patients with a score of 2 and less except these patients present with a persisting illness or unilateral finding [15, 95] .",

By means of special swabs, e.g. nylon flock swabs with highly adsorptive superficial coating, may improve the sampling capacity and releasing of the primary material to the transportation medium in addition to the sensitivity of the pharyngeal swab [58] . After taking of the sample, immediately a culture should be started or the rapid test should be performed. Otherwise, the pharyngeal swab should be inserted into a culture medium for transportation (''moist swab''). If an immediate transportation to the lab is not possible, the swab should be stored in the refrigerator for max. 12 h at 4-6\u00b0C [57].

            "text": "For quick evidence of GABHS, so-called rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) may be applied. Most of them are optic immunoassays (OIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or latex agglutination procedures. RADT are based on the identification of the Lancefield streptococci group antigen A. Most rapid tests are exclusively optimized for the identification of GABHS in pharyngeal swabs. Other b-hemolytic streptococci, e.g. group C and G as well as other species, are not assessed by the RADT tests. The sensitivity and specificity of the RADT for GABHS identification vary between 65.6 and 96.4 % or 68.7 and 99.3 %, respectively, depending on the manufacturer and the performance of the user [59] [60] [61] . In particular, a high inoculum quantity and well performed pharyngeal swab may improve the GABHS identification by means of rapid tests [62] . RADTs with clearly defined results such as optic immunoassays, are superior to latex agglutination procedures, especially when applied by persons who are not experienced in the evaluation of the test result [63] . Training of the users may increase the validity of the findings of the RADT findings [64] . However, especially the sensitivity of the RADTs is lower in comparison to microbiological culture [62] . Thus, rapid tests are recommended in particular in countries with only low incidence of streptococcal secondary diseases where a negative result of the rapid test is considered as being sufficient [62] . In cases of negative results of the rapid test and the urgent suspicion of bacterial pharyngeal infection, the identification by microbiological culture should be [24] . A crossreactivity of different bhemolytic streptococci on the Lancefield group agglutinant is possible [24] . Beside the determination of b-hemolysis on blood agar, Lancefield typing, and the determination of metabolic reactions, different procedures are applied for phylogenetic differentiation of b-hemolytic streptococci that are reserved to special laboratories (emm-typing, t-typing, 16S rRNA sequence similarity, multilocus sequence analysis, average amino acid identity, genometo-genome distance, genome sequences/signatures, codon usage bias etc.) [24] . In outbreak situations, for the identification of infection chains, or for differentiation between re-or new infection, a molecular genetic typing of the M protein (emm gene sequence) can be performed [67, 68] . The microbiological evidence of bacteria in the pharyngeal swab proves the existence of bacteria in the swab site: It is noteworthy to repeat that a positive result neither confirms the infection nor the disease. The detection alone of b-hemolytic streptococci in the pharyngeal swab does not allow secure differentiation between the streptococcal carrier status and streptococcal tonsillo-pharyngitis [17, 69] . Beside the nutrition media and the incubation conditions, the sensitivity of the culture also depends on the time of recording of findings (after 24 or 48 h) as well as the interpretation by the responsible person. A massive cultural growth of b-hemolytic streptococci makes the presence of an infection more probable [70] . The semiquantitative interpretation of the findings, however, depends crucially from the quality of the swab and other pre-analytic conditions. The cultural proof of anaerobes, as also of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, is provided upon special request on special culture media. Beside the cultivation of Corynebacterium diphtheria, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows identifying the diphtheria toxin gene and Elek's immuno diffusion test may prove the secreted toxin [36] .",

An EBV positive immune status is found in more than 90 % of the population at an age of 30 years or older. EBV positive tested persons excrete the virus periodically with the pharyngeal secretion. Therefore, the test result is insignificant in these patients [72] . The clinical suspicion of IM should be confirmed by laboratory examinations in doubtful cases or in cases of high risk patients (pregnancy, HIV infection, immune deficiency). A reliable distinction of EBV associated IM from e.g. CMV associated IM is only possible by pathogen-specific serology and/or evidence of the pathogens. The proof of the pathogens in the routine is not necessary. Much more, the serology is decisive for therapy (see below). A new EBV primary infection can be expected in cases of evident anti-VCA-IgM and anti-VCA-IgG without proof of anti-EBNA-IgG in the classical serological screening procedures (e.g. CLIA, ELISA, formerly also indirect immunofluorescence). It must be noted that the absence of anti-VCA-IgM in young children does not exclude primary EBV infection. Furthermore, the absence of EBNA-IgG is no proof of a new EBV infection but is also observed in some healthy EBV carriers and patients with immune deficiency. In immunocompetent patients, the suspicion of new EBV primary infection can be confirmed in cases of doubt by differentiation of the EBV specific IgG antibody status in the EBV immunoblot or EBV line assay. In children older than 5 years of age and adults (up to 90 %), even heterophilic antibodies can be identified in the context of EBV immune reaction as rapid test procedures in the modified Paul-Bunnel-test (monospot). These antibodies, however, are not EBV-specific with a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 90 % [73, 74] .",

In the literature, there is no reference revealing an evidence basis that might justify the indication of tonsillectomy based on streptococcal antibody titers beyond a specific cut-off value. This conclusion complies with the national DEGAM guideline [7] as well as to the results of the new, current literature research in the context of the present guideline. Regarding the streptolysins, as for example streptolysin S (SLS) and streptolysin O (SLO), these are virulence factors that are produced among others by b-hemolytic streptococci. When growing on blood agar, these cholesterol-binding, oxygenlabile exotoxins lead to the known characteristic bright and transparent zone caused by b-hemolysis [79] . They belong to the first identified streptococcal virulence factors. Antibodies against streptolysins can be measured in the blood and can be valued as expression of an immune response to streptococci. However, because of their high variability, it is difficult to use them as diagnostic parameter in relation to tonsillitis/pharyngitis. Up to now, the streptolysin antigen does not have any clearly determined pathogenetical relevance in the context of b-hemolytic streptococcal infections or b-hemolytic streptococcal sequelae. The so-called antistreptolysin O titer (ASLO titer) or the ASLS or ASLO values describe the human antibody production against those streptococcal antigens. The antibody production may be triggered by an acute b-hemolytic streptococcal infection. However, even severe b-hemolytic streptococcal infections were not necessarily followed by increased ASLO levels. A study of 87 healthy persons did not reveal any significant correlation between the ASLO level and the high sensitive CRP (hsCRP) as biomarker for an inflammatory immune reaction [80] . The authors concluded that there is no relation between the titer level and possible active inflammation in otherwise healthy patients [80] . The intensity of the immune response as a reaction to an acute streptococcal infection in terms of titer levels do vary interindividually. Approximately 40 % of all patients with a proven GABHS tonsillitis show elevated titer levels after the infection. Furthermore, elevated ASLO titers may persist in asymptomatic patients with or without GABHS proof as well as GABHS infections appear in other individuals without a significant titer increase and even a very rapid titer decrease might be observed during recovery [38, 39] .",

            "text": "In summary, numerous streptococcal virulence factors are known and the indication of new virulence factors is continuously increasing. Theoretically, a human immune response to many of those virulence factors can be measured. The antiDNase B titer, also known as antistreptodornase B titer or ASD B value, is a human antibody against a streptococcal desoxyribonuclease. In the context of AHT or AHD titer, a human antibody against the streptococcal hyaluronidase is measured. All those virulence factors seem to play a potential role in the infection processes triggered by streptococci. However, a clinical relevance of the produced antibody response with a clear cut-off value relevant enough for therapeutic decisions does not exist. These virulence factors and thus also the antibody production are not specific for GABHS. Other streptococci such as for example streptococci of group B, C, and G may also have those virulence factors. All streptococci antibodies that were clinically evaluated up to now do not allow any prospective risk assessment of which the development of purulent or immunogenic streptococcal secondary disease may be deducted. Only in cases of a clinically suspected streptococcal secondary disease, the assessment of the antibody response and the follow-up of the titer development may be helpful in the absence of other diagnostic options and thus contribute to the confirmation of the clinical-anamnestic suspicion of a previous b-hemolytic streptococcal infection [81, 82] . For determination of the antibody response against streptococci, mostly latex agglutination or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are used. The results may alter because of cross-reacting antibodies, antigen neutralizing serum factors, protein deficiency, immune deficiency, etc. The exact application of streptococcal antibodies in the context of rheumatic diseases [e.g. acute rheumatic fever (ARF), acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), etc.] will not be dealt with in this guideline because no consequences for specific action in the context of acute or recurrent tonsillitis result. An increased antibody response against streptococci (e.g. an increased ASL titer) neither indicates a protection against acute streptococcal infections nor an increased risk of acute streptococcal disease, nor an increased risk of purulent or immunogenic streptococcal secondary disease [38] . No prediction can be made regarding the streptococci carrier status or an increased contagiousness [82] .",

Articles published between 2011 and October 2014 were reviewed by the panelists and did not reveal contradicting results to the meta-analysis. Primarily, peritonsillar abscess is a clinical diagnosis that is characterized by fever, pain, unilateral swelling of the tonsil, sometimes including the cheeks/neck, dysphagia with changed voice (''hot potato voice''), odynophagia, hypersalivation and trismus. In most cases, the general condition of the patients is significantly reduced. In cases of dyspnea, stridor, or other signs of upper airway obstruction, problems during intubation may occur, requiring skilled staff and adequate instrumentation. Peritonsillar cellulitis, intratonsillar abscess, IM, cervical lymphadenitis, (abscessing) dental and gingival infections, sialadenitis, sialolithiasis, malign tumors, mastoiditis, or an aneurysm of the internal carotid artery should be excluded in the differential diagnosis. Inflammation values (e.g. white blood cell count and CRP) may be helpful in cases of clinical suspicion of peritonsillar abscess. It is noteworthy to emphasize, that their sensitivity and specificity are only moderate. As a result of odynophagia, some patients present with relevant dehydration. Therefore, a shift of serum electrolytes should be checked by blood tests. In contrasts to the meta-analysis, the panelists do not recommend intraoral sonography since this method is uncommon in Germany and conclusions in the literature were drawn from small sample sizes. If abscessing is clinically presumed beyond the peritonsillar space, imaging by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck are recommended. CT scan is able to confirm the diagnosis of peritonsillar abscess with a sensitivity of up to 100 % and a specificity of 75 % and it can-nearly always available and cost-effectiveidentify further abscessing. MRI allows a better soft tissue resolution and depiction of the vessels without radiation exposure and thus it is recommended especially for children. To facilitate the identification of infectious organisms, a swab from the throat/aspirated pus and culture are to be considered. The results may help to select the most appropriate antibiotic once the organism is identified, limiting the risk of antibiotic resistance.",

According to a meta-analysis, the treatment with oral cephalosporins is slightly superior to the one with penicillin V from a microbiological point of view [7] . The treatment with oral cephalosporins, however, is more expensive and additionally, there is no evidence that the higher bacteriological recovery rate is of significant clinical relevance [7] . Only very selected indications support administration of oral cephalosporins (for example: cefadroxil, cefalexin) including the failure of penicillin V, frequent recurrences, and whenever a more reliable eradication of b-hemolytic streptococci is desirable.

It should be noted that this conclusion is drawn from studies of the 1950s with intramuscular application of penicillin at the onset [86, [92] [93] [94] . The extremely low risk of immunogenic streptococcal secondary disease currently does not justify the routinely performed antibiotic application in cases of confirmed or suspected GABHS tonsillo-pharyngitis in Germany [7].",
