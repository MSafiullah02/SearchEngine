At 6 d posthatch, PEMS-designated poults were given a 1-mL oral gavage of a 10% suspension of feces from PEMSinfected poults. BW depression due to PEMS was not alleviated by MC, although there was less variation in mean BW of the MC-fed poults, and there was a highly significant reduction in mortality (68% in PEMS-exposed with MC vs. 32.5% in PEMS-exposed without MC). The reduction in mortality in the MC-fed poults was attributed to decreased bacterial content of the gut and to maintenance of packed cell volume and hemoglobin content. It was concluded that MC might be a potential nutritional intervention during PEMS. the turkey industry. Therefore, the observation that there were some apparently atypical E. coli isolates involved in PEMS represented a significant breakthrough in the diagnosis and control of PEMS.",

In one experiment, pathogenic bacteria caused a decrease in mortality in MC-treated (1% MC supplementation) broiler breeders during Weeks 12 to 14 compared to the control birds (Kemin Industries, 1993) . Thus, the same phenomenon might occur, which was indicated by the microbiological data from the cecal samples in the first experiment (Table  2) : MC at the 1.25 and 2.5% significantly reduced cecal populations of Enterobacteriaceae tribes and genera of bacteria.

            "text": "A systematic investigation to determine the effects of MC on PEMS-infected poults had not been conducted previously. MC fed at the 1.25% level in the diet of PEMSchallenged poults did not prevent the disease from occurring in the PEMS-challenged poults or the growth depression associated with PEMS. However, it did reduce the cumulative mortality by 50% and produced a delay in the onset of the initial mortality spike (Figures 2 and  3) . Dietary MC at 1.25% decreases bacterial load in the intestine and ceca. Therefore, it is possible that, at 1.25%, there was a decrease in the pathogenic bacterial load in the intestines or decreased colonization by various Enterobacteriaceae in PEMS-infected poults; however, the microbiological influence of MC in PEMS-infected poults was not determined in this study. Nevertheless, there are viruses such as newly identified and characterized turkey Astroviruses Shultz-Cherry et al., 2000 and 2001; Yu et al., 2000a,b) that induce a condition comparable to PEMS. It is, perhaps, possible that MC did not have any inhibitory influence on novel viruses associated with PEMS Shultz-Cherry et al., 2000 and 2001; Yu et al., 2000a,b; Heggen-Peay et al., 2002) , but its antibacterial influence possibly reduced the severity of enteric bacterial loads in PEMSchallenged poults in this study. The reduced bacterial load in control poults (Experiment 1) attributed to MC possibly is reflected in the overall decrease in mortality in MC-treated, PEMS-challenged poults (Experiment 2). However, the severity of the PEMS challenge in this study (1 mL of a 10% suspension of fecal matter from PEMS infected poults) was 10-fold greater than the PEMS challenge given in subsequent studies (0.1 mL of a 10% suspension of fecal matter from PEMS-infected poults) and might have been too large to be effectively suppressed by MC at 1.25%. Additional work with MC and its influence in PEMS appears to be warranted. Hemoconcentration, as indicated by a PCV of 45% in PEMS-infected poults was maximized 7 to 8 d after exposure. This peak coincided with the period of greatest diarrheal flushing, lack of appetite, dehydration, weight loss, and mortality similar to the observations made by Edens and Doerfler (1998) . All of these signs of PEMS disease contribute to reduction in blood volume due to severe dehydration leading to hemoconcentration and increased PCV. At 17 d of age, a more normal PCV developed in PEMS-infected poults. We hypothesized that this was a compensatory response in surviving poults as they attempted to rehydrate themselves.",
