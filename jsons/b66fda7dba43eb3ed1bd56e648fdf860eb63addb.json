Centralized and federated machine learning solutions represent the predominant way of providing smart services for users. However, moving data to central location for analysis causes not only many privacy concerns, but also communication overhead. Therefore, in certain situations machine learning models need to be trained in a collaborative and decentralized manner, similar to the way the data is originally generated without requiring any central authority for data or model aggregation. This paper presents a decentralized and adaptive k -means algorithm that clusters data from multiple sources organized in peer-topeer networks. Our algorithm allows peers to reach an approximation of the global model without sharing any raw data. Most importantly, we address the challenge of decentralized clustering with skewed non-IID data and asynchronous computations by integrating HyperLogLog counters with k -means algorithm. Furthermore, our clustering algorithm allows nodes to individually determine the number of clusters that fits their local data. Results using synthetic and real-world datasets show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized k -means algorithms achieving accuracy gain that is up-to 36%.",

Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced as an alternative distributed and privacy-friendly approach. FL allows users to train models locally on their devices using their sensitive data, and communicate intermediate model updates to a central server without the need to centrally store the data [13] . Specifically, users start by contacting the central server and downloading the learning algorithm and a global model, that is common to all users. The algorithm trains its model locally on each device using user private data and computes update to the current global model. Afterwards, the new updates on the learning parameters obtained from the algorithm on the device of each user are sent to the central server for aggregation. The server integrates the new learning parameters and sends the aggregated global model back to each user. These interactions with the central server are repeated till reaching convergence. This distributed approach for model computation diminishes the need for central storage of raw data, hence, computation becomes distributed among users and their personal data never leaves their devices.",

However, FL has issues that can be related to system and data challenges. Scalability of FL is a major system challenge, especially in use-cases involving a large number of users (e.g., thousands of users) using and improving the global model at the same point. Additionally, data skewness represents one of the main data challenges for FL, since the data is fully distributed and is generated according to behaviours of participating users. Generating a single global model that accumulates all user behaviours might not produce the best model for particular categories of the users. Specifically, global averaging model enforces a bias towards the behavioural patterns provided by the majority of users, while suppressing the patterns of less significant users [20, 21] .",

However, with a huge number of users participating in the training of a FL model, there is no control over size and statistical properties of training data used at each device. Thus, it is unrealistic to assume that the data produced by many different users will always be IID data. Specifically, data points generated by users can be quite different as data on each node can be driven using different phenomena. Therefore, two randomly selected users are likely to compute very different updates. This leads to a statistical standpoint where assumptions need to be made for non-IID data [13] .",

Finding an exact solution to the k -means problem is known to be NP-hard, therefore existing algorithms adopt incremental optimization strategies [4, 14] .

The more data points used in calculating a centroid, the higher the weight associated with this centroid while applying the averaging function.

Therefore, our clustering algorithm employs HyperLogLog counters to correctly approximate the total number of data points used in calculating the centroids [6] . HyperLogLog is a probabilistic data structure, which provides a reasonable approximation of cardinality estimation. We integrate HyperLogLog counters so that nodes can keep track of distinct data points used so far in model training, hence allow our clustering algorithm to correctly approximate the number of data points in the network.

To address these challenges, our clustering algorithm incorporates two different techniques to allow nodes decide the proper number of clusters that fit their local data. Particularly, when two nodes try to merge their local models represented by their centroids, our merging function applies k -means on centroids to group every pair of centroids that are close to each other. Then, our first approach to adaptively fix the number of cluster applies Bradley, Fayyad and Reina (BFR) algorithm to further merge the closest clusters together [19] .

General P2P k -means methods apply the steps of k -means while using the local data points available at each node after all nodes agree on the set of initial centroids. Then, each node performs the exchange procedure by selecting a random peer form the network to which it sends the computed centroids. We introduce two examples to further explain the consequences of update procedure. First, we consider a P2P network with number of nodes n = 3, such that nodes n 1 , n 2 , and n 3 , have data points with sizes equal to 30, 60, 90 data points, respectively. Also, we assume that the number of clusters equals to 3. Example 1. We assume that every node has data points from the three clusters, where each cluster is represented by one third of the number of points at each node (i.e. n 1 has 10 data points in each cluster, n 2 has 20, etc.). Node n 1 is the only active node to perform exchange iterations. Thus, n 2 and n 3 are going to apply the update operation as described in Algorithm (1). The update function applies simple averaging and treats the centroids generated by n 1 equally with the centroids of other peers, though for example n 3 uses more data points in computing its centroids. Accordingly, if the data owned by n 1 is not representative of the data owned by other peers, n 1 is causing deviation for the general clustering model, though it owns only less than 17% of total data points in the system.",

In this case, the update function takes an extra input that tells the number of data points belong to each cluster, i.e., nodes exchange the number of data points used to compute each centroid. For further exchange rounds, nodes have to update their counters to keep track of the number of data points used so far in generating the current centroids. Thus, nodes need to continuously accumulate the number of data points used to compute the centroids after every update operation.",

Then, n 1 and n 2 perform weighted averaging and update their centroids and increase their counters with data points from n 3 . In the second exchange round, n 1 and n 2 are engaged together in exchange iteration. Now, when n 1 updates its centroids again using centroids of n 2 , number of data points used in weighted averaging is going to reflect what n 3 owns twice, as centroids of n 2 and n 1 both count data points of n 3 . Accordingly, data points owned by n 3 are going to be overrepresented, adding to this the fact that its centroids are not correct in representing the three clusters expected in the global model.",

MinHash is widely used to estimate how similar two sets of points are. In our clustering algorithm, we create bit sequences similar to ones of HLL counters that encode data points using the MinHash algorithm. Having such bit sequences per cluster, nodes can evaluate how their data points are similar to data points used in other peers to calculate the centroids before performing the merge function. If there is an overlap in the MinHash bit sequences, then the centroids can be merged, otherwise no overlap indicates the clusters are not similar. Interestingly, this indicates that one of the nodes might not have the correct clustering results due to missing classes, and by adopting the centroids from the other node without changing them it can fix the cluster memberships of its local data. Our second approach is implemeted using BFR algorithm [19] to further merge the closest clusters together. We use BFR algorithm to computes the sum and sum of squares of each cluster in order to compute the standard deviation of points belonging to this cluster. The criterion for further merges can be determined by the gain in terms of cluster variance (i.e. lower value) after combining the data points in one cluster.

Then (b) when data becomes non-IID distributed. In (c) and (d) cases, we report the accuracy in case of asynchronous computations when data is distributed in IID and non-IID manner. The results confirm that general P2P methods work when data is uniformly distributed and nodes update their centroids with the same frequencies. Evaluation using PAMAP2, EnergyTime, and S1 datasets in the cases of asynchronous computations. Figure 2 reports the results of the remaining datasets in asynchronous computation scenarios. Results using PAMAP2, EnergyTime, and S1 confirm that our algorithm (DKM) is the only method capable of achieving accuracy comparable to the centralized version when we explore the expected real-world case scenarios of having non-IID data and asynchronous computations, while other methods fail to achieve acceptable accuracy.",
