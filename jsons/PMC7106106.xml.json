The lung opacities show a tendency to progress, with increase in size or involvement of multiple areas either unilaterally or bilaterally in moderate to severe cases. Rapid progression to unilateral multifocal or bilateral involvement, with reduction in lung volumes in the second week of illness, is typical in children who develop severe hypoxaemia (Fig. 2\n).23 In the advanced stage of the disease, which only occurs in a very small number of children, widespread ground-glass opacities and diffuse patchy consolidations are seen, likely representing progression to ARDS.",

Repeat CXR examination, as guided by failure of resolution of symptoms or change in clinical condition, will clarify the picture by revealing new pulmonary infiltrates as the disease progresses. Frequent monitoring of CXR changes has the additional benefit of detecting early radiographic deterioration in many patients, heralding clinical deterioration. Radiographic resolution, on the other hand, generally lags behind clinical improvement. Complete resolution of the airspace opacities can take more than a month in the most severely affected children.23 No preliminary evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis or lung volume loss was observed on follow-up in one paediatric case series.23\n",

The characteristic peripheral alveolar opacities are reminiscent of bronchiolitis obliterans-organising pneumonia (BOOP).6, 21, 44 In general, HRCT is sensitive in detecting more extensive airspace consolidation and ground-glass attenuation than CXR. The investigation is particularly useful when lung parenchymal abnormalities are minimal early in the course of illness, or being obscured by the diaphragm and the cardiac silhouette. The utility of chest HRCT lies in the early confirmation of airspace disease in radiographically inapparent cases with a strong contact history and clinical features highly suspicious of SARS, thus allowing prompt isolation and monitoring for clinical and radiological deterioration.",

The original WHO surveillance case definitions for SARS required that lower respiratory symptoms of cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing were present. Applying this would have missed many children who do not present with the above symptoms. The lack of sensitivity and specificity of the initial WHO case definitions have generated uncertainty in individual case management at the point of care.24, 52 With more understanding of the disease and identification of a novel coronavirus as the causative agent, the case definitions of SARS were revised on May 1, 2003.53\n",

The rationale for using corticosteroids is to suppress the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d which is thought to be the main factor accounting for the progression of disease. But using corticosteroids with possibly ineffective antiviral therapy in patients with viral pneumonitis can be hazardous.93 Despite the initial success of corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS, the report of an adult patient whose clinical course was complicated by fatal aspergillosis was disturbing and had even led others to recommend close laboratory monitoring for aspergillosis in SARS patients receiving corticosteroids.94, 95\n",
