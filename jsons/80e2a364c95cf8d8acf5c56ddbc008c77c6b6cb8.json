But it doesn't mean that the abnormalities of CT images could be observed in the COVID-19 infection while the initial RT-PCR is positive or negative. 3-6 Therefore, even though chest CT plays a key role in detection or diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, however, chest CT examination and RT-PCR results should be mutual verification for precise diagnosis in the patient suspected COVID-19 infection.",
