Respiratory tract infections in these young children are associated with high morbidity and mortality [2]. Over 65% of respiratory infections are caused by viruses [3]. In the last decades, improvement of molecular techniques has resulted in the discovery of new viruses. However, the viral etiology of RTI is still unknown in a significant number of cases [3]. Current diagnostic methods for virus detection are mainly based on molecular amplification techniques such as PCR, using large panels of the currently known pathogens and frequently detected viruses. Therefore, new viral pathogens might be missed. Moreover, it was estimated that more than 50 percent of the human virus species still await discovery [4].",

Although the result of virus detection in clinical samples by direct-sequencing are consistent with the results obtained with conventional molecular diagnostic methods for all samples, pre-amplification resulted in ten times more reads that could be assigned to viral genomic sequences when using the Repli-g systems instead of random RT/PCR. Consequently, more sequence information was obtained and almost complete virus genomes could be assembled with reads from positive samples. The results of virus classification of sequencing reads are shown in Fig. 2\nand Table 4\n. Sample 2 contained reads covering a major part of the hRV genome that could be classified as hRV-A38. Sample 3 contained a significant amount of reads that could be mapped to hMPV. Sample 5 contained reads mapping to hRV-C. In the diagnostic multiplex-PCR, this sample tested negative. Analysis of the viral sequence obtained from sample 5 revealed several mismatches between the forward primer used in PCR and the target sequence in the 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) of hRV-C, explaining the negative-PCR result. Respiratory syncytial virus sequences were detected in sample 6. The virus found in this sample could be classified as RSV-typeA. Finally, sample 7 contained reads that could be assigned to hRV-C. Whereas in sample 5 all picornavirus associated sequences could be assembled to a hRV-C genome, sample 7 contained significant numbers of reads mapped to other human enteroviruses and hRV-A genome.

Using standard molecular diagnostics, viral pathogens were detected in only half of the samples. Direct multiplexed whole-genome sequencing of nucleic acids extracted from these samples confirmed the results obtained by PCR. Thus, sensitivity of the WGS approach was at least similar to the sensitivity of the diagnostic PCR in this set of samples. Moreover, of the 4 patient samples tested negative in PCR, one sample revealed hRV-typeC using NGS. Due to the heterogeneous character of the hRV target region for detection by PCR, positive samples containing hRV will be missed using routine molecular diagnostics. Therefore, sequence-independent detection methods like WGS will enhance a causative diagnosis of viral RTI.",

Most enzymes like nucleases, proteases and polymerases are produced in recombinant-protein expression systems. Sequences from protein expression-vectors were detected in all samples used in this study. A well-known source of contaminants is the silica-based spin-filter columns used in DNA purification kits. The use of these columns might introduce parvovirus-like sequences and provide false positive diagnostic results [19] and should be avoided in NGS based methods. Similar to current molecular diagnostic methods, WGS is sensitive to cross-contamination. Therefore, the same procedures used for prevention of cross contamination in assays like PCR should be applied to WGS. Extraction of relevant information from sequencing data requires proper software tools. In recent years, a number of research groups working in the fields of microbiology or bioinformatics developed programs for the processing of sequence-data [14], [20], [21], [22]. Processing pipelines have to be capable of processing millions of sequence reads. Pipelines based on NCBI Blast are time-consuming and therefore less suitable for first-pass analyses. In our study we used a rapid procedure based on the short-read sequence assembling program Bowtie2 [11]. Assembly of reads against a dataset of all known viruses was sufficient to extract all significant virological genomic data that match the diagnostic results of the PCR-positive samples. Implementation of this kind of pipelines in Python-scripts were recently published by several groups [20], [21]. However, standardization of sample preparation and data processing is necessary for a proper implementation of multiplexed whole-genome sequencing in diagnostics.",
