            "text": "Beginning in March 2009, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was detected in the hilly region of Hubei province in central China. However, the cause of SFTS is unclear. The primary clinical manifestations of patients with SFTS were sudden-onset fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and gastrointestinal symptoms; these led to the disease being assigned the name SFTS. At first, the mortality rate of the infectious disease reached 30% (Yu et al., 2011). Subsequently, cases were reported in Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and other provinces of China, with clinical symptoms that were similar to those of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). Patients with such symptoms in Hubei province were initially diagnosed with HGA (Yu et al., 2010, Xu et al., 2008), but in most cases the laboratory evidence was insufficient to verify the diagnosis. The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that such symptoms were not compatible with those of HGA, as described in the United States (Wellman et al., 1988). In March 2011, a new virus was isolated from a patient\u2019s blood by the Chinese CDC and named SFTS bunyavirus (SFTSV) (Li, 2011). An aetiological investigation of the disease was undertaken by the Hubei CDC. According to the above clinical characteristics and case definition, surveillance for SFTS was initiated in Hubei province. To evaluate the aetiology and epidemiology of SFTS, enhanced surveillance of acute febrile illness was carried out in Hubei province in 2011.",

Among the 17 prefectural-level cities in Hubei province, 13 (including 29 counties and districts) reported SFTS cases. An investigation was performed to identify whether SFTS was caused by other pathogens. The clinical symptoms resembled those of human anaplasmosis, Brucellosis, and hemorrhagic fever (HFRS). Neither the specific nucleotide nor antibodies against those pathogens could be detected in blood samples from a majority of the patients. Instead, SFTSV and Hantavirus (HV) were detected from patients\u2019 blood. Because most SFTS cases in Hubei province were SFTSV infections, with few being HV and none being HGA, SFTSV was the major aetiological agent of SFTS in Hubei Province. However, the few cases of HV suggested that some suspected SFTS cases are confused with HV infection due to similar symptoms. There is no significant difference in the clinical symptoms between those patients with confirmed HV infection and those with confirmed SFTSV infection, but there are significant differences in clinical symptoms between laboratory-confirmed and unconfirmed cases (X2\n = 12.45, p < 0.001). Differences in symptoms between laboratory-confirmed SFTSV tests are thrombocytopenia (100%) and leukopenia (100%), and laboratory-unconfirmed SFTSV tests were 53% and 38%, respectively (Table 2).

            "text": "We concluded that SFTSV had long been epidemic in Hubei province because the clinical symptoms of our cases were identical to those of Anaplasma infection, which was found in Haemaphyalis longicornis in 2010 in Hubei province (Zhang et al., 2010). Reports from Henan province in China showed that only 8% of SFTS cases had evidence of HGA (Xu et al., 2011). Infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum has been suggested as a cause, but the pathogen was not detected in laboratory testing of the majority of patients in 2011 in Hubei province. This suggests that SFTSV may cause subclinical infections in children and adults. Moreover, the cytopathic effects of SFTSV were modest in Vero cells, rendering detection problematic. Therefore, the distribution of SFTSV and HGA infections in Hubei p rovince should be investigated further.",

SFTSV has been isolated from ticks by the Chinese CDC (Zhang et al., 2011). Moreover, person-to-person and blood transmission of SFTSV was reported (Bao et al., 2011, Gai et al., 2011, Jiang et al., 2015).",

These findings support use of qPCR of serum samples to confirm detection of SFTSV during the first week after illness onset, and serum ELISA for detection during the second week.
