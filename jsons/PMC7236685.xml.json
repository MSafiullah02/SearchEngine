To some extent, the SV of keywords in Baidu can reflect the real demands of citizens.

Because the Baidu index in 2020 and the Baidu index increment relative to 2017-2019 did not obey the normal distribution, the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was conducted. Spearman Correlation Analysis was used to analyze the correlations between the Baidu index and the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases. Considered that there may be a lag effect between the newly confirmed/suspected and the network search behavior, and Spearman Correlation Analysis was conducted between the Baidu index on that day and the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases 7 days later. Additionally, a distributed lag model was used to analyze specific lag effects (the time that people who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be suspected/confirmed after searching online). Before constructed a distributed lag model, took the natural logarithm of the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases and the Baidu index. Starting from the zero-order lag model (simple linear regression), it increased the lag effect step by step. For example, the third-order lag model simultaneously considered the regression effect of the Baidu index on the day and the first 1 to 3 days on newly confirmed cases. All data analyses were performed using R 3.6.2 software (R Foundation for Statistical Analysis), in which the distributed lag model used the DLNM function package. Two-tailed P value < 0.05 indicated as statistical significance. Figures were designed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).",

Therefore, we investigated the symptom characteristics of COVID-19 by analyzing the Baidu search-engine data and identified possible awareness gaps if possible.

However, it was found that unlike the common cold or flu, and the upper respiratory tract symptoms were few. In this study, we found that cough and fever were the most searched symptoms for people in Hubei province based on the big data from the Baidu Index (Fig. 3A). The SV of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as nasal obstruction, runny nose, sneezing, and sore throat were lower, while the SV of lower respiratory tract symptoms such as chest tightness, dyspnea, shortness of breath and chest pain were higher (Fig. 3C), which was consistent with the symptoms of COVID-19 reported in the previous studies and the plan of diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 (China trial version 7).5, 6, 7, 8 The reason why the upper respiratory tract symptoms were less than the lower respiratory tract may be related to the fact that ACE2 receptors were widely distributed in lung tissues and less distributed in the nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal mucosa. Single-cell sequencing data analysis showed that the average proportion of ACE2-positive type \u2161 alveolar cells was only about 1%. The respiratory epithelial cells from the lower respiratory tract sample contained about 2% ACE2 positive cells while almost no cells obtained from nasal and bronchial samples showed high ACE2 expression, which indicated that the lower respiratory tract was considered as high risk, while the nasal cavity was in low risk.17 Therefore, we speculate that after the SARS-CoV-2 reaches the respiratory tract and lungs, it bindsto the ACE2 receptor and replicates, damaging the respiratory tract and lungs and causing viremia, which manifests as cough and fever. The virus may then reach and infect other organs with ACE2. In severe cases, it can trigger an \"immune inflammation storm\", which can lead to multiple organ failure and even death.",

It was suggested that there is a correlation between the big data of search and the newly confirmed/suspected cases, which has a certain early warning effect for infectious diseases. A distributed lag model is a model for time series data in which a regression equation is used to predict current values of a dependent variable based on both the current values of an explanatory variable and the lagged (past period) values of this explanatory variable.22\n,\n23 The distributed lag model has been used in economics after Almon popularized them in 1965 and has been widely used in environmental health studies.24, 25, 26 We believe that some people who search for symptoms related to COVID-19 on the internet may be potential patients. Therefore, there may be a close correlation between the popularity of online search and the confirmed/suspected cases. However, this correlation is not immediate. The potential patients who search for symptoms related to COVID-19 on the internet will gradually become suspected/confirmed cases in a subsequent period, which means there is a lag effect. In the current study, the results of the distribution lag models indicated that the infected people who search for related symptoms on the internet might start to see doctors and become suspected cases in about 2 to 3 days later, and be confirmed in about 3 to 4 days, which was similar to the National Health Commission's announcement that the national average time from onset to confirmation was 4.95 days.27 Besides, we know that the number of the newly confirmed is affected by the diagnostic criteria, while the SV is not affected by this. However, especially, due to the changes of diagnostic criteria, the number of newly confirmed cases in Hubei province suddenly increased on February 12, rapidly decreased on February 13, and then gradually decreased in the following days, suggesting that the overall trend of newly confirmed was stable. Therefore, we believe that these changes will not affect the correlation between the overall trend of the Internet big data and the number of newly confirmed cases.",

The changing trend of SV for symptoms not only reflected people's real need but also had significant implications for our health departments to recognize the characteristics of new diseases, predict the epidemic trend and formulate strict guidelines for diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. However, we must be clear that this correlation between the data of search and those of real world is not equal to causation, and it may be influenced by many factors, such as the differences in education and economic conditions of netizens. Besides, there are some other limitations to our study. Firstly, the SV of keywords could be influenced by the continuous changes of individual search behavior, and the Baidu Index Platform still has some keywords not included, which may lead to underestimation of the correlation. Secondly, the keywords of symptoms in this study were identified based on the symptoms recorded among COVID-19 patients. As the public knowledge of the pandemic and the awareness of COVID-19 gradually increases, the included search keywords should be increased accordingly, and even the search keywords for reasonably suspected symptoms should be monitored to fully utilize big data in preventing and controlling new infectious diseases. Finally, using internet search data to assist epidemic surveillance depends on the number of internet visits. The primary users of the internet search engines in China are young and middle-aged, and different regions have different population sizes so that the internet training for all people, especially the aged, should be strengthened in the future to provide more accurate and valuable data.",

            "text": "In the future, we should use advanced methods to achieve at least the following two ideal models for the prevention and control of infectious diseases: firstly, using big data and artificial intelligence to build an early warning system for infectious disease; secondly, using smartphones to lock down the activity trajectories of infectious sources, and realize the intelligence of cognition, early warning, prevention, and control. Compared with the data of traditional surveillance systems, the internet big data has the characteristics of large sample size, fast response, easy access, and low cost. However, digital disease surveillances of the internet still face many challenges, such as the uncertainty of network user behavior, the inaccuracy of search keyword acquisition, and the incompleteness of network coverage. Therefore, in the future, more researches should focus on how to improve the accuracy of the internet search data and explore how to combine search engine data with actual medical information systems. In short, big data will help medical development.",
