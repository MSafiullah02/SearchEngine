To prepare for an influenza pandemic, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends use of a particulate respirator that is at least as protective as a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 FFRs. 1 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance called for use of N95 respirators to protect HCWs during the initial stages of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. 2 The threat of a high mortality influenza pandemic is current 3 and an outbreak such as the 1918-19 influenza pandemic can place unsustainable demands on limited FFR supplies. United States acute care hospitals collectively hold an estimated 60 million N95 FFRs, and state holdings vary from 14,000 to 32 million. 4 Assuming 20% to 30% of the U.S. population would become ill with influenza, demand could range from 1.7 to 7.3 billion FFRs. 5 The supply of FFRs can become scarce in even less critical circumstances. For example, various healthcare facilities experienced FFR shortages during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. [6] [7] [8] The CDC has issued guidance for extended use and limited reuse of N95 FFRs in healthcare settings during a pandemic. 9 The threat to public health compels efforts to seek an effective means to mitigate an FFR shortage.",

Although all facilities had a buffer supply, all acknowledged that supply was limited and unlikely to be sufficient for any more than a few days of peak demand. Trust in UVDR was a frequently cited barrier to implementation (Findings 10, 11). Although there is a wealth of data in the peer-reviewed literature on UVDR and the ability of FFRs to withstand UVDR, these data must be made easily available for HCWs. Government agencies (e.g., CDC, NIOSH, U.S. FDA) would need to provide their approval for UVDR to be implemented (Finding 10). This is not a trivial process, especially in the preparedness/planning stage. However, for UVDR to be an option, the government must take steps to support the approach. As part of these steps, considerations for availability of UVDR devices during a pandemic must be defined. Hospital administrators expressed concerns about purchasing and stocking UVDR devices that have a single purpose (Finding 17). One potential solution would be to make the UVDR device versatile enough to be used for other applications. Two of the hospital systems were already using UV for disinfection, so it is possible to envision a multiuse UV device that can also be used for UVDR. One of the hospitals considered other options, such as having a third party decontaminate FFRs or relying on municipal or state health authorities maintain a UVDR unit stockpile in case of need.",

Emergency preparedness must consider logistics, such as where units would be installed, and how they would be calibrated and maintained (Finding 16, 17) . Employees need to be trained on the new approach ahead of any emergency (Finding 9, 12). It is impractical to think this training can take place at the outset of a pandemic. There are many ways to handle this ahead of time. For example, training could be included as part of annual fit testing, although this would require resources that are not freely available in health care systems. Participants typically expressed a preference for keeping an FFR for their own use (Finding 1). In light of this, UVDR protocols that rely on sharing respirators are unlikely to be accepted and batch processing would not likely be well received. This tends to favor the use of multiple smaller UVDR units so that individuals could decontaminate their own FFRs, rather than collect and decontaminate FFRs at a central location. Frontline HCWs strongly favor having decontamination available near point of care (Finding 4), which complements individual FFR decontamination. This conflicts with the legal participants' preference (Finding 19) for a small staff of well-trained individuals to decontaminate FFRs. It may be possible to resolve this conflict through well-designed UVDR equipment that is intuitive to operate (Finding 15). Factors that affect the decision about where to locate UVDR units will need to be considered, including distance to get to a unit without risking cross-contamination while the clinician transports their used mask, time in relation to distance to travel, and space for the UVDR units and storage of FFRs that are waiting decontamination (Finding 12, 16) .",
