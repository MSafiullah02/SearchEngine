Up to 7.73 million people died of these three diseases, accounting for nearly 14% of all death in 2015, not to mention other pulmonary diseases.

            "text": "The lack of effective treatment for many pulmonary diseases is at least partly due to our limited understanding of the pathobiology of these diseases. The lung has a defense mechanism consisting of physical barriers and immune cells against infection and injury. Upon insult, such as infection or tissue injury, the innate and adaptive immune system in the lung initiate a series of responses, followed by a period of normalization to restore homeostasis in the lung. Inflammation is one of the immediate responses of the innate immune system, in which cytokines constitute a significant part (Shaikh 2011). Interleukin (IL)-1 beta and its isoform IL-1 alpha are proinflammatory cytokines that exert pleiotropic effects on a variety of cells and play a vital role in acute and chronic inflammatory processes (Ren and Torres 2009). IL-1 signal acting through the type 1 receptor IL-1R1, with the help of IL-1 receptor accessory protein, activates transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Binding of IL-1 to type 2 receptor IL-1Ra does not lead to downstream signaling, and IL-1Ra is therefore considered a decoy receptor. IL-1 beta has important homeostatic functions under normal circumstances, while its overproduction is implicated in the pathophysiological changes in diverse disease states. IL-18 is another member of the IL-1 family. The IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) is a heterodimer consisting of IL-18R alpha and beta chains. IL-18 also mediates responses and activates NF-kappa B and AP-1, resulting in the production of IFN-gamma, essential for immunity against invading pathogens. In addition, IL-18 can act as a Th2 response inducer in some allergic diseases (Sedimbi et al. 2013).",

The cleavage to turn IL-1 beta and IL-18 from their precursors into the active forms is tightly regulated. Over the past decade, researchers have found that inflammasome is the key component for this process, therefore, critical for the induction of a proper inflammatory response. The core sensor protein of inflammasome comes from the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) family. All NLR family members are classified into subfamilies based on the N-terminal domain they contain: NLRAs have transactivator activation domains (ADs); NLRBs have BIR (baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat) domains; NLRCs have CARD (caspase activation/recruitment domains); and NLRPs have PYD (pyrin domains) (Leissinger et al. 2014). Of these, at least four NLR members (NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRB1) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) can form inflammasome complexes with the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) and pro-caspase-1. Inflammasome formation results in the catalysis and activation of caspase-1, which in turn catalyzes the cytokine precursors (Lee et al. 2016).",

Taking the NLRP3 inflammasome as an example: the first signal (e.g., TLR4 or other pattern recognition receptors) stimulates NF-kappa B and enhanced the expression and synthesis of NLRP3. The second signal induced NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Common signal is provided by P2X purinoreceptor 7 (P2X7R) bond by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), K+ efflux, lysosome destabilization caused by urate crystals, DNA and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in mitochondria, etc.",

Il1r1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed defective granuloma formation containing fewer macrophages and lymphocytes, defective migration of immune cells, and a decrease in IFN-gamma production in the spleen. These changes were associated with increased mortality and an enhanced mycobacterial outgrowth in the lungs and distant organs (Juffermans et al. 2000). IL-l alpha/beta double knockout mice developed significantly larger granulomas in lungs than wild-type mice after infection with M. tuberculosis, suggesting a protective role of IL-1 (Yamada et al. 2000). More precisely, M. tuberculosis infection in Il1r1\u2212/\u2212 mice led to a profound defect of early control of infection with higher bacterial load in the lung and necrotic pneumonia. While pulmonary CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were unaffected (Fremond et al. 2007). However, in contrast, Master et al. showed that M. tuberculosis prevented inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1 beta release and zmp1, which encoded a Zn2+ metalloprotease, was responsible (Master et al. 2008). Besides, Sugawara reported that Il1r1\u2212/\u2212 mice developed significantly larger granulomatous lesions with neutrophil infiltration in the lungs than wild-type mice did, and IFN-gamma production in spleen cells was lower in Il1r1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Sugawara et al. 2001).",

            "text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and induced a strong IL-1 beta response. The mechanism is not yet fully understood, but it was believed that M. tuberculosis induced inflammasome activation involving the export of the 6 kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) through a functional protein secretion system ESX-1 (Mishra et al. 2010). The function of ESX-1 in NLRP3 activation was further confirmed by Dorhoi et al. They also concluded that although NLRP3 inflammasome was critical for IL-1 beta secretion in macrophages, Nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice were not susceptible to M. tuberculosis infection, due to NLRP3-independent compensatory IL-1 beta production in lung parenchyma (Dorhoi et al. 2012). Kleinnijenhuis et al. showed that the secretion of IL-1 beta in macrophage depended on the activation of P2X7R by endogenously ATP. However, they also suggested that constitutively expressed caspase-1 in monocyte need not be activated by M. tuberculosis (Kleinnijenhuis et al. 2009). Kurenuma et al. found that a genomic locus called \u201cregion of difference 1\u201d (RD1) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis was essential for the activation of caspase-1 and subsequent secretion of IL-1 beta and IL-18 in macrophages. The activation was induced via RD1-dependent K+ efflux independent of P2X7R (Kurenuma et al. 2009). While the above experiments were performed in an acute settings, McElvania et al. showed that M. tuberculosis induced IL-1 beta secretion in human and mouse macrophages in vitro, depending on ASC, caspase-1, and NLRP3, but not NLCR4. In addition, murine ASC protected the host during chronic M. tuberculosis infection, but the effects of caspase-1 and NLRP3 were dispensible (McElvania Tekippe et al. 2010).",

Furthermore, Il1r1\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a decrease in neutrophilic inflammation after infection (Cai et al. 2012).",

ASC was found to be important for caspase-1 activation during L. pneumophila infection. Activation of caspase-1 via ASC did not require sense of flagellin by NLRC4. Besides, activation of caspase-1 in macrophages occurred independently of NLRP3 (Case et al. 2009). Slightly different, Pereira et al. found that NLRC4-dependent growth restriction of L. pneumophila was fully due to flagellin. In addition, L. pneumophila multiplied better in Nlrc4\u2212/\u2212 mice, and macrophages compared with that in caspase-1 deficient ones, suggesting a caspase-1-independent downstream of NLRC4 (Pereira et al. 2011b). The importance of flagellin in activating NLRC4 was further tested, as nonflagellated Legionella bypassed the NLRC4 inflammasome-mediated growth restriction (Pereira et al. 2011a). The type 4 secretion system was also suggested to be important for NLRC4- and caspase-1-dependent host response (Silveira and Zamboni 2010).",

And Il1r\u2212/\u2212 mice were susceptible to chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection (Reiniger et al. 2007). NLRC4 inflammasome was identified critical for optimal bacterial clearance in an in vivo model of lung infection with P. aeruginosa. The activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1 beta were triggered by bacterial flagellin and type 3 secretion system (T3SS) (Franchi et al. 2007). The importance of NLRC4 and T3SS was further manifested by Sutterwala et al. and Miao et al. (Miao et al. 2008). Sutterwala et al. also reported that the P. aeruginosa strain expressing the exoenzyme U (ExoU, a T3SS effector) phospholipase was able to suppress caspase-1-mediated cytokine production via NLRC4, associated with more severe disease (Sutterwala et al. 2007). Pilin, a major component of the type 4 bacterial pilus, has also been reported to activate NLRC4 inflammasome via the T3SS in P. aeruginosa infection (Arlehamn and Evans 2011). Activation of NLRC4 may depend not only on T3SS or flagellin but also on bacterial motility, as caspase-1 activation and IL-1 beta production were reduced when exposed to nonmotile P. aeruginosa in macrophages and dendritic cells (Patankar et al. 2013). As an example, the temporal loss of P. aeruginosa motility has been described during chronic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (Luzar et al. 1985; Mahenthiralingam et al. 1994). Recently, Rimessi et al. demonstrated that flagellin of P. aeruginosa caused mitochondrial perturbation, which regulated NLRP3 activation and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 processing by mitochondrial Ca2+ in human bronchial epithelial cells (Rimessi et al. 2015).",

They further reported that fungal clearance in the lung was reduced and the levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma in the sera were significantly lower in Il18\u2212/\u2212 mice (Kawakami et al. 2000a). IL-12 and IL-18 have been shown to synergistically increase the fungicidal activity against C. neoformans. A single administration of either IL-12 or IL-18 was not effective, while their combination significantly prolonged survival time of infected mice and reduced the fungal growth in lungs (Qureshi et al. 1999). To discriminate the activity of IL-18 from that of counterpart cytokines like IL-12, Kawakami et al. conducted the experiment in IL-12p40\u2212/\u2212 mice. Neutralizing anti-IL-18 antibody almost completely abrogated IFN-gamma production, and host response in IL-12p40 and IL-18 double knockout mice was more profoundly impaired than in IL-12p40\u2212/\u2212 mice.

Meanwhile, IL-1 beta upregulated IL-1R1 through an autocrine mechanism (He et al. 2016). Our group examined the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to hemorrhagic shock in a mouse model of ALI. In our study, pulmonary endothelial cells were the primary source of IL-1 beta secretion after hemorrhagic shock. DAMPs (especially HMGB1) activated NADPH oxidase and caused thioredoxin-interacting protein to associate with NLRP3, leading to inflammasome activation. Notably, endothelial cells were also targets of IL-1 beta, which might cause a range of inflammatory molecules and an amplification of inflammation leading to ALI (Xiang et al. 2011). We further showed that there existed a negative-feedback regulating the activation of inflammasome. While activating NLRP3 inflammasome, LPS also induced pyrin expression, which in turn suppressed the activation of inflammasome in mouse lungs. However, hemorrhagic shock suppressed IL-10 and pyrin expression, therefore significantly enhancing inflammasome activation and IL-1 beta secretion in macrophages and endothelial cells (Xu et al. 2013).",

In this process, uric acid was also released and may serve as the ligand for NLRP3. Additionally, mice deficient in NLRP3 or treatment with IL-1 receptor antagonist or glibenclamide displayed less VILI (Kuipers et al. 2012). Using an in vitro model, Wu et al. also demonstrated that alveolar macrophages subjected to cyclic stretch released uric acid, which activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, and induced the release of IL-1 beta and IL-18.

It was shown that in vitro DEP stimulated IL-1 beta production in monocytes and macrophages (Pacheco et al. 2001; Yang et al. 1997) and in epithelial cells (Boland et al. 1999). Il1r1\u2212/\u2212 mice and mice treated with IL-1Ra had reduced inflammation upon DEP exposure.

In a model of mild asthma, IL-1R signaling was reported to be required, as eosinophilic inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia were strongly reduced in Il1r1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In contrast, the IL-1R was not required in an allergic model with adjuvant (Schmitz et al. 2003). Wang et al. applied a recombinant adenovirus expressing human IL-1ra in an ovalbumin-sensitized murine model of asthma. Single intranasal delivery before airway antigen challenge significantly decreased the severity of airway hyperresponsiveness, reduced pulmonary infiltration, and decreased peribronchial inflammation (Wang et al. 2006).",

            "text": "Direct evidence showed that allergic airway inflammation depended on NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as Th2 lymphocyte activation and cytokine production were reduced in mice deficient in NLRP3, ASC, or caspase-1. The critical role of IL-1R1 signaling was also confirmed in mice deficient in IL-1R1, IL-1 beta, and IL-1 alpha (Besnard et al. 2011). Kim et al. recently demonstrated that levels of NLRP3 and caspase-1 in BALF from the patients with asthma were significantly higher than that in healthy subjects. Furthermore, suppression of mitochondrial ROS generation by NecroX-5 attenuated allergic airway inflammation associated with inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activation in primary tracheal epithelial cells and mouse lung tissues. In addition, blockade of IL-1 beta substantially reduced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic mice (Kim et al. 2014). It has been shown that gain of function SNPs in human NLRP3 are linked to food-induced anaphylaxis and aspirin-induced asthma (Hitomi et al. 2009). In multiple asthmatic models of mixed Th2/Th17 responses, serum amyloid A activated NLRP3 inflammasome to induce IL-1 beta secretion in dendritic cells and macrophages and promote CD4+ T cells to secrete IL-17A in an IL-1-dependent manner (Ather et al. 2011). Similarly but differently, Martin et al. reported the importance of caspase-1 and IL-1R, but not NLRP3, for Th17 development in NO2-promoted allergic airway disease (Martin et al. 2013). Also, Allen et al. determined that the NLRP3 inflammasome was not required in multiple allergic asthma models in mice. Besides, in all the models, the cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-18 in the lung were below the level of detection (Allen et al. 2012). And Kool et al. suggested that NLRP3 and IL-1 beta did not contribute to the Th2 adjuvant effect of uric acid in mice (Kool et al. 2011).",

In addition, bleomycin-induced inflammation was IL-18-independent (Gasse et al. 2009). It has also been reported that mice lacking ASC had reduced neutrophil recruitment and a reduction in IL-1 beta production following bleomycin challenge (Gasse et al. 2007).

They also found that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by silica required both a K+ efflux and the generation of ROS (Cassel et al. 2008). Similarly, NLRP3 inflammasome activation was triggered by ROS generated by NADPH oxidase. In a model of asbestos inhalation, Nalp3\u2212/\u2212 mice showed diminished recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lungs, paralleled by lower cytokine production (Dostert et al. 2008). Hornung et al. demonstrated that silica activated caspase-1 and induced the release of mature IL-1 beta in human PBMCs. IL-1 mediated the neutrophil influx after exposure to silica crystals. The phagocytosis of silica by macrophages resulted in lysosomal destabilization and subsequent rupture releasing proteolytic enzymes, such as cathepsin B into the cytosol, and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Hornung et al. 2008). In a case-control study, Ji et al. found that an SNP in the NLRP3 gene (rs1539019) was associated with a significant increase in coal workers pneumoconiosis in a Chinese population. This association was more pronounced in patients with stage I disease suggesting a potential role for the NLRP3 inflammasome in the development of silicosis (Ji et al. 2012). NLPR3 activation has also been reported in nonmyeloid cells. NLRP3 activation, as well as activation of caspase-1, led to maturation and secretion of IL-1 beta in human bronchial epithelial cell lines and primary human bronchial epithelial cells (Peeters et al. 2013).",

This was further manifested in P2X7R knockout mice. Inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition, cell apoptosis, and NF-\u03baB activation as well as TGF-beta, nitric oxide, ROS, and IL-1 beta secretion were reduced in knockout mice (Moncao-Ribeiro et al. 2014).",

We can easily appreciate how the discovery of the inflammasome affects our understanding of the role of IL-1 and IL-18 signaling in lung disease. Still, in some diseases, the importance of inflammasomes has not been fully investigated. Besides, NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophage is currently the most clearly defined type. The potential of other inflammasomes in nonmyeloid cells needs to be further studied in the process of injury and recovery in lung diseases.",
