            "text": "\nPolygonum multiflorum (\nFig. 1) is one of the most popular traditional Chinese medicines and is an ingredient in many medicines and prescriptions. It has been widely used to treat various diseases that have been commonly associated with aging for many centuries in China. A recent study proved that it can exhibit antioxidative activity (Lv et al., 2007, Wang, 2005a, Wang et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2009a), mainly due to its flavonoid and phenolic acid constituents. The pharmacological effects of stilbene in Polygonum multiflorum have been reported to promote anti-aging effects (Long and Dougherty, 2003, Lin et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2001a, Chan et al., 2002, Um et al., 2006, Cheung et al., 2014) and hepatoprotective activities (Huang et al., 2007, Liu et al., 1992). Anthraquinones, another main component of this plant, also have many biological activities, such as effects against cancer (Ma et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2011b, Way et al., 2014, Yu et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2009a, Lin et al., 2006, Tabolacci et al., 2010), developmental anomalies (Yon et al., 2013), and tonic tension (Lim et al., 2014). However, an increasing number of recently published studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of Polygonum multiflorum. Some researchers have found that Polygonum multiflorum shows not only hepatotoxicity but also a possible drug interaction with warfarin to result in bone marrow suppression. Specifically, the long-term use of Polygonum multiflorum may lead to liver and kidney toxicity. The toxicity of emodin has been detailed by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP technical report, 2001). In the current review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge and traditional uses of Polygonum multiflorum, including its botany, phytochemistry, pharmacodynamics and potential applications, toxicology and pharmacokinetics.",

The toxicity of this plant was first described in Bencao Huiyan (another famous monograph of traditional Chinese medicine written in China during the Ming dynasty), which described this plant to be of minimal toxicity to humans. In other monographs of Materia Medica, such as Kaibao Bencao, Bencao Mengquan, and Xinbian Bencao, this plant was described to be used for the treatment of scrofula, carbuncles, and postpartum and morbid leucorrhea and to reinforce the kidney and promote anti-aging effects.",

(Yang et al., 2008) is the most commonly used processing method, as described in \u201cXian Shou Li Shang Xu Duan Mi Fang\u201d (Secret Formulary for Traumatology and Fracture Taught by Immortal), which was written during the Tang Dynasty. This work first proposed that the plant be prepared as follows: \u201c10 lb, cooked with half a catty of black bean\u201d. The book \u201cSue Shen Liang fang\u201d of the Song Dynasty states that \u201cAfter a one-day-long immersion, cut the Polygonum multiflorum into half-inch-thick sections and then mix well with the water of the black bean by placing fleece-flower root layer upon layer with the black bean. This should be followed by steaming until the beans become rotten, removal of the beans, and drying of the root in the shade\u201d. The Qing Dynasty \u201cCheng Fang Qie Yong\u201d proposed that the plant be \u201cmixed seven times with black bean juice\u201d (Yu, 2014). In modern times, the 2010 edition of \u201cChinese Pharmacopoeia\u201d described the following detailed rules for the Polygonum multiflorum processing method: Mix the slices or pieces of Polygonum multiflorum thoroughly with black bean juice (Preparation of black bean juice: Boil 10 kg of black bean in a sufficient quantity of water for 4 h and stew to get about 15 kg of juice. Boil the bean residue again in water for about 3 h and stew to get about 10 kg of juice. Combine to get about 25 kg of the black bean juice). Carry out the stewing method in a suitable non-ferrous container until the juice is exhausted or carry out the steaming method, steam it alone or steam it after being mixed with black bean juice to a brown color on all sides, dry in the sun to partial dryness, then cut into slice and dry. For each 100 kg of slice (piece) of Polygonum multiflorum use 10 kg of black bean (Editorial Committee of Chinese Pharmacopoeia., 2010).",

The fracture plane of Polygonum multiflorum is yellowish-brown or reddish-brown and starchy and exhibits a brocaded pattern (abnormal vascular bundle). The cork layer of the root transverse sections shows 2\u20133 columns of rectangular cells. The phelloderm is a sequence of tangential prolonged cells, the surface view of the cork cells is subpolygonal, and there are decadent epidermal cells on the outside. The phloem is broad and mainly composed of parenchymatous cells, with the brown cells distributed in the parenchyma, and the phloem ray is not obvious. There are several uniquely shaped compound vascular bundles and scattered fiber bundles, with subpolygonal or irregular fibers that are 5\u201330 \u03bcm in diameter with a wall thickness of 2.5 \u03bcm. Clusters of calcium oxalate are scattered in the cambium ring. The xylem are more developed, and the vessels are subrounded, primarily bordered, pitted, and 13\u2013101 \u03bcm in diameter. The fibers are square and 5\u201318 \u03bcm in diameter with a wall thickness of 2.5 \u03bcm. The sequence of wood ray cells is wide but not very obvious, and the majority of the cell walls are thick. The starch granules are fairly abundant with simple spherical granules that are 4\u201339 \u03bcm in diameter. The hilum are stellate or forked, and compound starch granules are common, whereas brown blocks are ubiquitously scattered (\nFig. 2). Of the counterfeits of Polygonum multiflorum, Musa basjoo Sieb. et Zucc has no cork tissue but does have needle-like calcium oxalate crystals. In Pteroxygonum giraldii Damm et Diels, the cork cells of are yellowish-brown, there are fewer vessels in the xylem, and the vessels are primarily reticulate. In this same species, there is a single starch granule that is circular, triangular, oblong or subovate. The hilum is pointed, cleft or cruciate. In the counterfeit species Dioscorea bulbifera L, the cork cells are approximately square, and the walls are pale brown. The mucilage cells are oblong, and there are calcium oxalate raphides that are approximately 50 \u03bcm in length.

Moreover, resveratrol (13), polydatin (14) (Xu et al., 2009), rhaponticoside (15) (Yi et al., 2007), cis-2,3,5,4\u2032-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-\u03b2-d-glucoyranoside (16) (Sun et al., 2009) and cis-2,3,5,4\u2032-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-(6\u2033-O-\u03b1-d-glucopyranosyl)-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (17) (Xiao et al., 2002) were also isolated from Polygonum multiflorum. Four stilbene derivatives, denoted polygonumosides A-D (18\u201321), were isolated and identified from this plant in 2014 (Yan et al., 2014). Other stilbenes, such as tetrahydroxystilbene-O-(malonyl)-hex, tetrahydroxystilbene-O-deoxyhex and tetrahydroxystilbene-O-(caffeoyl)-hex, were also found in Polygonum multiflorum, but their structures have not yet been identified (Qiu et al., 2013).",

Emodin-8-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (EG), another effective component of Polygonum multiflorum, was tested in vitro against AChE I zymogen (extracted from the mice cerebral cortex) at doses ranging from 23.1 to 92.6 \u03bcmol/mL, and the results indicate that EG can inhibit AChE I activity. In addition, in vivo AChE I activity could also be inhibited by EG (0.5\u201380 mg/kg/day, p.o., once or every day for a period of 15 days), and this inhibition was reversible (Chen et al., 2001a). Previous studies have also demonstrated that Polygonum multiflorum extracts can treat insomnia and brain function disorders by inhibiting the activity of AChE. These experiments were conducted on a 96-well plate assay using Ellman\u05f3s method. The AChE activity inhibition percentages of aqueous and ethanol Polygonum multiflorum extracts at doses of 20 \u03bcg/mL were 59.88 and 47.24, respectively (Lin et al., 2008). Polygonum multiflorum aqueous extract, which was administered p.o. to mice for 28 days, obviously improve the cognitive deficits induced by A\u03b225-35 on mice. And, the acetylcholinesterase and GPx activity were increased, the TBARS level was decreased in mice brain after administration for 4 weeks. These effects might be related to the antioxidant activity of Polygonum multiflorum (Um et al., 2006).",

The results showed that TSG pretreatment attenuated the expression of the p-JNK, this effect related to the antioxidantive ability (blocked the ROS increase) of TSG (Li et al., 2010c). Another study verified that the neuroprotective effects of TSG against MPP+-induced damage and apoptosis in PC12 cells (0.1, 1 and 10 \u03bcM) are likely to be mediated by the activating the PI3K signaling pathway, the stimulation of PI3K activity leads to downstream target Akt phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of cell apoptosis (Qin et al., 2011). TSG also protected human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells against MPP+-induced cytotoxicity (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 \u03bcM). The mechanisms underlying this effect may be mediated through (i) its protection of mitochondrial function, (ii) attenuating the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, (iii) and inhibiting the MPP+-induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by decreasing the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 and preventing caspase-3 activation (Sun et al., 2011). These mechanisms were also demonstrated in a study on staurosporine (STS)-induced toxicity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The results of the study showed that the administration of 200 \u03bcM TSG can significantly protect against STS-induced apoptosis in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Yang et al., 2014). In addition, TSG (5\u2013400 \u03bcmol/L) significantly promoted cell viability and reduced cell membrane damage in \u03b2-amyloid 25-35- and H2O2-treated human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. TSG may initially antagonize the cell damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and prevent the subsequent toxicity of amyloid beta protein in nerve cells (Zhang et al., 2004, Xu and Yi, 2013).",

These extracts may also be used as therapeutic interventions for the treatment of oxidative neuronal death. A previous study showing this effect was conducted by evaluating glutamate-induced oxidative cell death in HT22 hippocampal cells (Kim et al., 2013). An 80% ethanol extract of Polygonum multiflorum protected U373 human astrocytes from hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death (LC50: 35.2\u00b11.2 \u03bcg/mL, EC50:<0.2 \u03bcg/mL for hydrogen peroxide). The protective mechanism was mediated by its free radical scavenging and antioxidant capacities (Steele et al., 2013). The hexane extract of Polygonum multiflorum also exerts a protective effect against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultured cortical neurons. This neuroprotection may be mediated through both DR- and mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathways involving DR4, Bcl-2, XIAP, and cIAP-1(Jang et al., 2013).",

The results suggested that TSG is able to improve the memory ability and regulated the body weight of d-galactose induced aging mice through reducing the levels of ROS, NO and IGF-1 and increasing the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), Ca2+ and Klotho protein in the serum (Zhou et al., 2013). Another study also proved that TSG (20 and 40 mg/kg/day, p.o., for 42 days) can increase SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities in the serum and organs and decrease the content of 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in a d-galactose-induced mouse model of dementia (Lv et al., 2007). However, TSG also has anti-melanogenic activity at doses ranging from 60 \u03bcM to 240 \u03bcM through a mechanism that is likely mediated through the non-competitive inhibition of tyrosinase, the down-regulation of the expression of melanogenic proteins, and a reduction of tyrosinase/tyrosinase-related protein 1 complex formation (Cheung et al., 2014).",

A previous study has shown that TSG (1 and 5 \u03bcM) promotes an ERK-dependent differentiation of PC12 cells, directly enhances ERK1/2 activation and intracellular calcium level in hippocampal neurons. TSG-mediated enhancement of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is involved in the facilitation of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) by TSG, the processes may be involved in the effect of TSG on hippocampal LTP including the ERK\u2013CREB pathway and modulation of the response to the NMDA receptor by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity. This effect may contribute to the enhancement of learning and memory observed in animal models (Wang et al., 2011a). This effect was verified in AD-like APP transgenic mice of different ages treated with TSG (120 and 240 \u03bcmol/kg/day, p.o., for 4, 10 and 16 months). The results showed that TSG can significantly improve the learning-memory abilities (Zhang et al., 2006c).",

A polysaccharide fraction was purified from Polygonum multiflorum Praeparata, which is composed of rhamnose, arabinose, xylose and glucose at a molar ratio of 1.64:1.00:1.34:6.06. This fraction increased the levels of serum IL-2 and hematological parameters, enhanced the antioxidant profiles, and promoted the haematopoiesis of splenocytes by up-regulating the expression of EPOR and GATA-1 proteins in a cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced mouse anemia model (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg/day, for 7 days, intraperitoneal). This result indicated that the polysaccharide fraction is a potential immunomodulatory agent (Chen et al., 2012b). Another polysaccharide extracted from Polygonum multiflorum was administered orally at doses of 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g/kg/day to mice for 10 days. Moreover, the results reflected that this fraction inhibited the Cy-induced weight loss of immune organs, decreased the number of blood cells, increased the phagocytic percentage and phagocytic index in peritoneal macrophages, increased the contents of serum hemolysin and the esterase-positive rate of T-lymphocytes, and enhanced the ConA-induced proliferation of splenic T-lymphocytes (Ge and Liu, 2007). A previous investigation also showed that the polysaccharide extracted from Polygonum multiflorum Praeparata exerts immunomodulatory effects (mice, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day, p.o., for 7 days) (Zhang et al., 2008). These findings demonstrate that polysaccharides from Polygonum multiflorum and Polygonum multiflorum Praeparata have immunomodulatory effects; however, the structure and composition of these immunomodulatory polysaccharides have not been clarified. Similar findings were also observed for anthraquinone glycoside extracted from Polygonum multiflorum. This compound, when used in vitro at doses ranging from 31.25 to 125 \u03bcg/mL, (i) significantly accelerated T and B lymphocyte proliferation and mixed lymphocyte reaction, (ii) improved macrophage phagocytosis, (iii) increased tumour necrosis factor (TNF) secretion and the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, (iv) and antagonized the restraining effect of the lymphocyte helper/suppressor ratio induced by mitomycin (MitC) (Sun et al., 2006).",

TSG was also shown to decrease the TC/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio and to markedly increase the levels of serum HDL-C, nitric oxide (NO) and SOD (Wang, 2005a, Wang et al., 2009a). These results were verified by another study through an experimental hyperlipidemic rat model treated with TSG (90 and 180 mg/kg/day, p.o., for 7 days) (Gao et al., 2007). Calreticulin, vimentin, HSP 70, lipocortin 1, and Apo A-I are proteins that may be molecular targets responsible for the TSG-induced atherogenesis suppression (Yao et al., 2013). The anti-hyperlipidaemia effect of Polygonum multiflorum polysaccharides in mice were investigated through its administration at doses of 50 and 200 mg/kg/day for 28 days. The results showed that the serum levels of TC, TG and AI were significantly decreased, whereas the HDL-C, LPL, HL and LA levels were significantly increased (Zhai et al., 2010). In addition, a previous study investigated the mechanism underlying the lipid regulation activity of the major chemical components of Polygonum multiflorum in L02 cells. The results showed that TSG increased the content of cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A) and subsequently promoted the lipolysis of cholesterol. TSG also showed the best LDL-reducing effect. Moreover, emodin inhibited 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), which are key enzymes in the synthesis of TC and TG. Physcion increased the content of hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL), subsequently boosting the lipolysis of triglycerides. At the same time, physcion showed the best VLDL-reducing effect (Wang et al., 2014). Another study investigated the anti-hyperlipidemic effect in the combined hyperlipidaemia rat model by treatment with emodin alone (75, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day, p.o., for 4 weeks). The result showed that emodin may be effective for the prevention and treatment of combined hyperlipidaemia model rats. The mechanisms may be mediated by increases in the anti-oxidative effects of blood SOD and GSH-PX and reductions in the blood MDA levels (Wu, 2008).",

The histopathological examination also clearly showed that emodin reduced lymphocyte cells, Kupffer cells, ballooning degeneration, cell necrosis and hyaline degeneration following CCl4- and d-galactosamine-induced damage (Lin et al., 1996). Treatment with emodin (20, 30 and 40 mg/kg, p.o., one administration) significantly lessened the observed toxicity by protecting the acetaminophen-induced alterations in various blood and tissue biochemical variables in rats 24 h after administration, and the protective effect was dose-dependent (Bhadauria, 2010). The protective effect of emodin may be related to anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. In turn, these mechanisms were mediated by blockade of TLR4/MD2 complex expression on the cell surface of macrophages, which led to the deactivation of MAPKs and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, and the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 production (Yin et al., 2014). Rhein (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, p.o., one administration) can reduce the levels of glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamate-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), creatinine (CREA), urea nitrogen (UREA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity rats.

The methanol extract of this plant (1\u20131000 \u03bcg/mL) promoted the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) for hepatic non-parenchymal cells. Consequently, the proliferation of stellate cells was inhibited, and the proliferation of primary liver cells was increased. Moreover, the phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells was enhanced, as determined using fluorescein-labelled Escherichia coli as the target. Using dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver cirrhosis mice, the methanol extract of Polygonum multiflorum at 20, 23, 30, 37, and 44 mg/kg/day (p.o., for 25 days) was to promote the expression of HGF that stimulates the proliferation of hepatocyte enhances the regenerative potential of liver to reverse dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver damage (Huang et al., 2007). Both Polygonum multiflorum and Polygonum multiflorum Praeparata extracts (water-extracted, 15 g/kg/day, p.o., for 8 days) can be used to treat the hepatic lipid accumulation caused by prednisone acetate-, carbon tetrachloride- or thioacetamide-induced liver damage in mice (Liu et al., 1992). Moreover, these extracts attenuated liver damage by reducing lipid peroxidation as well as by positively modulating inflammation (Lee et al., 2012).",

One is the death receptor-induced extrinsic pathway, which includes ligands and their receptors, such as FAS, TNF, TRAIL, caspases and Bcl2. The other pathway is the mitochondria-apoptosome-mediated intrinsic pathway, which includes key effector caspases-8, -9 and -10. Emodin is characterized as a strong apoptotic agent. Emodin has been shown to significantly inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells, as evidenced by an IC50 of 36\u00b12.6 \u03bcg/mL (Liu et al., 2003). Emodin at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM arrests liver cancer Huh7, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase, this effect was accompanied by induced cyclin A, cyclin B, Chk2, Cdk2 and P27 expression and down regulated Cdc25c and P21 expression in time-dependent fashion. This result demonstrated that emodin can regulate common gene expression or suppression in different liver cancer cells and the potential biological pathways activated by emodin (Hsu et al., 2010). Aloe-emodin, another anti-apoptotic agent found in this plant, inhibited the growth of human cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells) at the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations between 2.5 and 40 \u00b5mol/L. This effect was associated with decreased cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinases 2 (CDK2) expression and increased cyclin B1 and CDK1 expression. Aloe-emodin had a down regulatory effect on the expression of c-myc in human cervical cancer cells through the PKC\u03b1 pathway (Guo et al., 2007a). Aloe-emodin also inhibited T24 human bladder cancer cell viability, inducing G2/M arrest and apoptosis at doses of 5, 10, 25 and 50 \u03bcM. Furthermore, aloe-emodin could increase the accumulation of p53, enhancing the expression of p21, Fas, Bax and cytochrome c, and decreasing Bcl-2 before leading to apoptosis (Lin et al., 2006). Moreover, this treatment (10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 \u03bcM) induced cell death through S-phase arrest and caspase-dependent pathways in human tongue squamous cancer SCC-4 cells (Chiu et al., 2009) and exhibited cytotoxic effects against neuroblastoma cells (SJ-N-KP) (Pecere et al., 2000) and B16-F10 melanoma cells (Tabolacci et al., 2010).",

This percentage was 56% after oral administration at a dose of 12.8 mg/kg. The mechanism underlying these effects is likely related to the suppressed cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression or directly inhibited COX-2 enzyme activity in RAW264.7 macrophage cells (Zhang et al., 2007b). TSG also showed beneficial effects on acetic acid-induced experimental colitis in mice following intragastric administration at 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg for 7 days and exerted beneficial effects on acetic acid-induced experimental colitis by upregulating the PPAR-\u03b3 mRNA and protein levels and inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway. These effects in turn decreased the expressions of the downstream inflammatory mediators TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and COX-2 and MDA content (Zeng et al., 2011). A study showed that administrations of emodin (1, 2, and 4 mg/kg, i.p., one administration) could lessen the LPS-induced mammary gland injury and inflammatory cell infiltration, decrease the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activation in the mammary gland, down-regulate the expression and production of TNF-a, IL-6, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) in a dose dependent manner. The anti-inflammatory mechanism was inhibited by the activation of NF-kB and MAPKs signal pathways (Li et al., 2013a). The Polygonum multiflorum extract (70% ethanol extract, p.o., 0.58, 1.15, 2.30, 4.60 and 9.20 g/kg, for 3 days) exhibited strong anti-inflammatory activity based on edema severity and vasopermeability in a mouse model of inflammation and in the response of mice to pain induced by acetate acid. The mechanism was proposed to be related to its immunosuppressive effects (Lv et al., 2001).",

The neuroprotective effect of TSG is caused by multifunctional cytoprotective pathways (Wang et al., 2009b). TSG (30, 60, 120 mg/kg/day) was administered to rats for 30 days in a cardiac remodeling study. In this context, TSG prevented cardiac remodeling induced by pressure overload in rats. The underlying mechanisms may be related to a decrease in the angiotensin II level, an antioxidant effect of the tested compound, the suppression of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 expression, and the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (Xu et al., 2014). Another study indicated that TSG exerted potent anti-platelet activity against collagen-induced aggregation. TSG is likely to exert protective effects in platelet-associated thromboembolic disorders by modulating human platelets (Xiang et al., 2014).",

A previous study investigated the effect of Buyanghuanw Pill Jiajian Fang (BPJF, composed of Radix astragali, Angelica sinensis, Ligusticum wallichii, Radix Paeoniae alba, peach kernel, safflower, Lumbricus, Fructus Psoraleae, and Cistanche salsa) on patients suffering from PD. Sixty patients with PD were randomly divided into the treatment group (BPJF+Madopar group, n=30) or the control group (Madopar group, n=30) and treated for 3 months. The total effective rate of the treatment group was 87.5%, whereas that of the control group was 77.5%, and this difference was significant (Zhang, 2008). Another study observed the effect of Qishu decoction (contains Astragalus, prepared Rhizome of rehmannia, Radix codonopsis, lyceum, donkey-hide glue, Angelica sinensis, Polygonum multiflorum, Caulis Spatholobi, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis) on the treatment of NSCLC patients with leukopenia after chemotherapy. Two-hundred-forty patients with NSCLC were randomly divided into the treatment group (Qishu decoction group n=120) or control group (Leucogen and Batilol tablet group, both n=120). Both groups were treated for 10 days. The total effective rate in the treatment group was 91.5%, whereas that for the control group was 72.8%. This result suggested that the Qishu decoction can greatly improve bone marrow depression, promote blood-producing functions and recover leukocytes, thereby benefiting NSCLC patients (Xiang and Han, 2013). The He shou wu and Rou cong rong decoction (composed of Polygonum multiflorum, Cistanche salsa, Radix Astragali preparata, Ligusticum wallichii, Angelica sinensis, and Salviae miltiorrhizae) was demonstrated to enhance immunoregulation and improve the clinical symptoms in a study of 34-year-old inpatients with kidney deficiency and blood stasis KDBS (Chen et al., 2006). The Shou wu ji li formula decoction (composed of Polygoni multiflori preparata, stir-baked Fructus tribuli, Angelica sinensis, Fructus ligustri lucidi, Ecliptae herba, Rehmannia glutinosa libosch, duckweed, Fructus Xanthii, Clematis chinensis, Radix sileris, Semen Astragali Complanati, and Radix Glycyrrhizae preparata) combined with the Kaliziran tincture formula was effective for treating blood deficiency and wind sheng-type vitiligo, and there were fewer adverse reactions. The mechanism of action may be through an increase in tyrosinase activity and modulation of the immune system. This combination was found to change the white spots in vitiligo to become darker (Bai, 2013). Polygonum multiflorum is used widely in clinical practice, and there are many studies similar to those mentioned above; we therefore do not list all of the studies in this manuscript.",

A study that evaluated the hepatotoxicity of the aqueous and acetone extracts of Polygonum multiflorum and Polygonum multiflorum Praeparata on mice (5, 10, and 20 g/kg/day, p.o., for 28 days) indicated that the hepatotoxicity of the aqueous decoction was much higher than that of the acetone extract. Moreover, the hepatotoxicity of the acetone extract of Polygonum multiflorum was considerably higher than that of Polygonum multiflorum Praeparata (Wu et al., 2012). Another study established the \u201cdose-time-toxicity\u201d relationship of the hepatotoxicity caused by administration of a single dose of the water-extracted and ethanol-extracted components of Polygonum multiflorum to mice. The water-extracted components (from 5.5 to 30.75 g/kg) and the ethanol-extracted components (from 8.5 to 24.5 g/kg) caused obvious damage to the liver organization, resulting in significantly increased ALT and AST serum levels, and this effect was dose-dependent (Huang, et al., 2011). Other studies have demonstrated that Polygonum multiflorum Praeparata also exerts side effects on the rat liver; however, the toxicity was less than that obtained with Polygonum multiflorum (Li et al., 2012d, Hu et al., 2006a, Hu et al., 2006b, Hu et al., 2007).",

Rhein also induced the apoptosis of HK-2 cells at a dose of 40 \u03bcM. However, the toxicity of rhein was weaker than that of emodin (Da et al., 2009).

The suppression of the phosphorylation of ERK through the MAPK/ERK signal pathway and alterations in the proportions of lipid moieties may lead to the impairment of the outer mitochondrial membrane in renal tubular epithelial cells.

The injury in mouse blastocysts occurs via the intrinsic apoptotic signaling processes, impairing subsequent embryonic development (Chang et al., 2012). Moreover, the adverse effects of Polygonum multiflorum can be observed not only in the liver and kidney but also in the lung. An ethanol extract of Polygonum multiflorum was found to exert toxic effects in the rat lung after repeated intragastric administration for 28 days at a dosage of 40 g/kg (Li et al., 2013b). Emodin and rhein also showed mutagenicity in TK gene mutation analysis at the concentrations of 80 and 120 \u03bcg/mL (Zhu et al., 2011). In addition, a previous study compared the acute toxicity of different components of Polygonum multiflorum on mice. The acute toxicity of dual extraction components was stronger than that of the ethanol- and/or water-extracted components, and the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) were 20.0, 98.4 and 78.0 g/kg, respectively (Huang et al., 2010).",

After the tissues were extracted with methanol, the metabolites were identified by LC-MS/MS. TSG, the main component of Polygonum multiflorum, was rapidly absorbed into the body fluids, widely distributed throughout the body and quickly eliminated. TSG was mainly distributed in the liver and lung but hardly penetrated the blood-brain and blood-testicle barriers (Lv et al., 2011). Emodin was found predominantly in the liver and brain (Lin et al., 2012). Another study evaluated the pharmacokinetic behaviors of typical constituents of different types of processed Polygonum multiflorum after oral administration in rats by LC-MS/MS. The results showed that the bioavailability of gallic acid improved, and the absorption of TSG, polydatin and emodin from the processed product in rats was reduced compared with that obtained with the raw product (Zhang et al., 2013). Some studies have found that stilbene glucoside and emodin were rapidly converted to glucuronide conjugates in rats after oral administration (Sun, 2004, Liu et al., 2011). Further pharmacokinetic studies indicated that the AUC, C\nmax and T\n1/2 of emodin were increased after stilbene glucoside treatment, and the glucuronidation of the emodin levels was significantly inhibited. This phenomenon may be attributed to the inhibition of UGT1A8 mRNA expression by stilbene glucoside (Ma et al., 2013).",

These studies have only focused on the differences in the contents of common components but have ignored differences in the more minor components in these plants, which is crucially important for Polygonum multiflorum not only in terms of quality but also clinical use. The combined anthraquinones are used as indicator compounds to characterize the quality of this plant, which should have a minimum content of 0.10%, as delineated in the Pharmacopoeia of the People\u05f3s Republic of China; this percentage is calculated based on the amounts of emodin and physcion. However, chrysophanol-8-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside and other combined anthraquinones (Yang et al., 1998) are also found in Polygonum multiflorum.

The second is the length of the delivery time: long-term drug delivery can easily show liver toxicity, whereas short-term drug delivery may result in liver protection. Third, a study revealed that TSG and physcion likely attenuated the cytotoxic effect of emodin (Yu et al., 2011); therefore, the different experimental results may be due to the different TSG, physcion and emodin ratios in the herbs.
