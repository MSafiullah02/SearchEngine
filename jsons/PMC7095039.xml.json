Lifetime low-level inflammation due to silent HIV replication in sanctuary sites, co-infections (e.g., CMV, EBV or HBV/HCV), intestinal dysbiosis, habitus (e.g., tobacco or intravenous drug use), sequelae of past infectious processes and long-term toxicity of certain antiretroviral medications may be implicated to varying degrees in the pathogenesis of these conditions [10, 19, 20]. Up to 70% of HIV-infected patients nowadays managed in the ICU are receiving long-term cART [6, 8, 9, 21\u201324]. This epidemiological shift translates into a continuous rise in non-AIDS-related ICU admissions which broadly exceeded those for severe OIs in most of recent cohorts. Furthermore, on the basis of encouraging outcomes, HIV infection is no longer a definite contra-indication for SOT in patients with chronic kidney, liver or heart failure, thereby enlarging the scope of critical illnesses in this population [25\u201327].",

Indeed, bacterial pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, complicated lung cancer and pulmonary edema due to congestive heart failure have become major causes of ARF, while stroke or Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis are overtaking classic OIs of the central nervous system (CNS) in patients admitted for life-threatening neurological disorders [2, 3].

This also applies for Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea and other hospital-acquired infections though HIV-infected patients appear at higher risk for multidrug-resistant pathogens due to frequent healthcare and antimicrobial exposure [37, 38]. Excepting those with profound immune deficiency [6, 39], HIV-infected patients with sepsis exhibit no discrepancies in terms of plasma levels of host response biomarkers, disease severity and survival when compared to HIV-uninfected controls [40, 41]. Therefore, the diagnostic workflow and initial management of HIV-infected patients with a protective CD4 cell count for usual OIs (i.e., above 200\u2013250/\u00b5L) has no relevant particularities and should follow standard procedures and guidelines [42].",

Severe pneumonia due to non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, CMV, Histoplasma capsulatum, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptococcus neoformans may rarely occur in patients with CD4 cells < 100/\u00b5L [51, 54]. Other features to consider include an history of OI at risk for relapse (e.g., tuberculosis), OI-directed prophylaxis (e.g., second-line PCP prophylaxis such as atovaquone or aerosolized pentamidine are less effective than SXT), the extent of extra-pulmonary failure (e.g., septic shock does not occur during PCP and should trigger the search for bacterial superinfection or a concurrent OI), the presence of HLH (more common with certain OIs such as tuberculosis or disseminated histoplasmosis), radiological patterns, microbiological findings [usual non-invasive samples, plus fiber optic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveloar lavage (BAL) in severely immunosuppressed patients], and a geographical origin at risk for imported OIs. Along this line, an important migratory flow towards Western Europe has occurred throughout the last decade. The prevalence of seropositivity among migrants reflects the epidemiological pattern of their native country, although evidence exists that HIV infection is often acquired in the post-migratory phase [55]. After resettlement, one major driver of AIDS-associated complications in seropositive migrants is the prevalence of a given OI in the country of origin, with tuberculosis being among the greatest concerns [56].",

            "text": "PCP continues to decline in frequency as a cause of ICU admission but remains the most common AIDS-defining OI encountered in the ICU, especially in patients with previously unknown HIV infection [5, 24, 33, 52]. AIDS-related PCP typically presents with worsening exertional dyspnea, non-productive cough and fever over 2\u20134 weeks\u2014in contrast, PCP arising secondary to SOT or hematological malignancy is often more fulminant [57]. A diagnosis of AIDS-related PCP rests on the identification of cystic or trophic forms of P. jirovecii trough staining and/or immunofluorescence on BAL fluid, which have a > 90% sensitivity and a ~ 100% specificity in patients with a clinical presentation and a CD4 cell count compatible with this condition (Table 1) [54, 58]. The detection of P. jirovecii DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in BAL fluid is highly sensitive but poorly specific in HIV-infected patients due to a high prevalence of colonization (up to 70%) in patients with low CD4 cell counts [59\u201361]. Serum \u00df-D-glucan (cut-off level, 80 pg/mL) is also sensitive (> 92%) yet lacks specificity (78\u201382%) as the test may be positive in other AIDS-related OIs such as invasive candidiasis or histoplasmosis [62, 63]. Typical PCP patterns on high-resolution chest CT scan include reticular infiltrates, intra-parenchymal cysts, patchy or diffuse ground-glass opacities and alveolar consolidation that usually spare the peripheral regions, without pleural effusion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Fig. 2). SXT remains the first-choice regimen (Table 1), including in patients developing PCP while receiving this combination as prophylaxis. Whereas its benefit remains debated in other immunosuppressed hosts [64, 65], strong evidence exists for using adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in suspected or proven AIDS-related PCP, with reduced requirement for invasive MV and in-hospital mortality rates when started within 72 h following SXT introduction in patients with PaO2 < 70 mmHg while breathing room air [54, 66].",

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) should be performed on at least one respiratory sample in HIV-positive patients with suspected tuberculosis, both to distinguish Mycobacterium tuberculosis from other mycobacteria in those with sputum smears positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and to allow earlier detection of M. tuberculosis in AFB-negative sputum smears (sensitivity in AFB-negative/culture-proven tuberculosis, 50\u201380%) [54, 68]. NAATs including probes for rpoB mutations may also provide information on rifampicin susceptibility weeks before culture-based tests. Interferon-gamma release assays lack sensitivity for diagnosing active tuberculosis and cannot act as a decision-making tool in this indication [54]. The first-line regimen for suspected or definite pulmonary tuberculosis is shown in Table 1. Whether adjunctive corticosteroids exert a beneficial outcome effect in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis-induced ARF remains to be investigated [69, 70].",

Of note, rituximab should not be included in the chemotherapy regimen in patients with CD4 cells < 50/\u00b5L due to excess toxicities without survival benefit [86]. The management of cART in this context requires a close collaboration between ICU, hematology and infectious diseases physicians [87].

The severity of KS depends on the presence of life-threatening localizations (e.g., the lower respiratory tract), its extension, and the degree of immune deficiency [51, 91]. The treatment of AIDS-related KS rests on immune restoration through cART and, occasionally, chemotherapy for aggressive presentations. Steroids should be avoided in patients with KS as they can exacerbate the course of the disease [91]. Multicentric Castleman disease is a HHV8-induced polyclonal B lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by recurrent bouts of fever with lymphoid hyperplasia and severe systemic inflammatory symptoms linked to inappropriate release of IL-6, IL-10 and other cytokines, ultimately resulting in HLH and transformation to NHL [93, 94]. Etoposide is the first-line drug for severe associated HLH, while long-term outcomes have markedly improved with the use of rituximab [95]. Primary effusion lymphoma (as diagnosed through positive HHV8 PCR and presence of large B cells in pleural or peritoneal fluid) and DLBCL may also complicate the course of HHV8 infection in seropositive patients.",
