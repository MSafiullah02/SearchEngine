The median number of days between intubation and ECMO was 3 days (range 0\u20139 days). The median PaO2/FIO2 ratio, PEEP, mean airway pressure, and lung compliance before initiation of ECMO were 70 (range 52\u2013147), 15 cmH2O (range 10\u201318 cmH2O), 21 cmH2O (18\u201327 cmH2O), and 28 mL/cmH2O (range 13.6\u201370 mL/cmH2O), respectively. Selected laboratory data of the patients on admission were as follows: median serum KL-6 (a marker of interstitial pneumonia) was 333 U/mL, LDH was 460 IU/L, and procalcitonin was 0.12 ng/mL. With regard to ECMO settings, the median blood flow was 4 L/min (range 2.5\u20135.3 L/min), the median size of the draining cannula was 24 Fr (range 21\u201325 Fr), and the median size of the infusing cannula was 20 Fr (range 16\u201321 Fr). For anti-viral treatment, lopinavir was used for 13/14 (93%) patients. All patients received empirical antibiotics (carbapenems or 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins). Ciclesonide, a glucocorticoid inhaler, was used for 4/13 (31%) of the cases. The effectiveness of any of the medications cannot be assessed at this time.",

The adoption of a platform for real-time discussion to guide the use of a scarce resource such as ECMO has been valuable to the Japanese doctors who are caring for critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection. A central near-real-time data repository is optimal to perform just-in-time epidemiologic studies and to develop algorithms that can inform clinical decision-making.",
