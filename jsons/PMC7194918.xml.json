Soon after it started spreading quickly and reached other cities in China, Japan, and South Korea. As this paper goes to press there are more than 190 countries affected, and according to the World Health Organization it has reached pandemic stage. The previous epidemics of Coronavirus were Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012.",

Although the final results of these studies may take a long time to be completed (may be up to a year) the interim research data may be helpful for the urgent demand arising from the pandemic [1]. Also, Chinese herbal medicines, which are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections, are being tested for their abilities to directly inhibit the SARS-CoV-2. The results show that of the large number of natural compounds that were screened, 13 were present in Chinese medicines. These were found to have potential for anti-2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) activity [2].",

According to results of a recent search of PubMed no less than 50,340 research papers have been published on this compound and hence this agent may be considered relatively safe when applied to SASRS-CoV-2 infected patients.",
