For example, I keep all my financial records in a self-constructed database, and I do financial planning with tools I've developed for myself. One of the advantages is that I get exactly the information I want, in the visible form I want, and I understand the details of how the tools work-for example, what assumptions they make, which is seldom or never true with on-line \"calculators\" such as those that estimate your income tax or plot a graph of future savings for retirement. I rarely use algebra to solve everyday mathematical problems because it's so much easier just to write a program. I prefer to write a program to compute, say, compound interest than to use a formula because (1) it's much faster than looking up or re-deriving the formula, (2) I can decide whether I want just a single result, a chart of gain over time, or a graph, and (3) I don't need to make any simplifying assumptions, such as a constant rate of return. To exemplify the last, in planning financially for our sons' college I wrote a little program that included both of our sons' expected tuition and board (and relevant dates), our estimated savings rate, raises in my wife's and my salaries, and also expected large purchases, such as a new car.",

I wanted to track some critical inflection points on the progression of the pandemic. In particular, I wanted to track whether and when social distancing had any noticeable effect. Technically, I wanted to see if and when there might be a deviation from the ordinary, purely exponential increase one gets from a situation where each infected person infects a fixed number of other people. With social distancing, that number should decrease. 3",

            "text": "I'll cut to the chase, and then backfill details. My very first graph, aimed to compare infection rates in California, compared to the US as a whole, appears below. The graph starts on March 18-two days after social distancing was instituted-and continues until March 29 of 2020. This is a plot of log values of the data, since exponentials (which is the form of unfettered, constant infection rate growth) then appear as straight lines. The key lesson here is that, at the beginning of this time period, the slope of CA infections is significantly less than the US as a whole. That's what I expected to see. Selfishly, it's what I hoped for. To avoid confusion, note that I scaled the CA data so that it precisely matched the US at the beginning, just so that I could easily compare slope, there. (Rescaling and then applying the log function just provides a constant vertical shift; log ay = log a + log y.) But there are interesting complications. While the blue (CA) graph is fairly straight, with the possible exception of a small downturn in the final two days, a colleague pointed out that it is a little jagged. It turns out that the jagginess is too much to be random error (1 / root N). But, a day later I read in the paper that California had been having trouble collecting data. Apparently, some counties were not reporting, or not reporting in a form that could be imported into the state's data bases. That fact may resolve the puzzle of jagginess. But, it's also true that the graph is as good as the data. I used: https://ncov2019.live. Finally, I could not get to the site at exactly the same time of day each day, and the data was continuously updating.",

But now, although both CA and US appear to have tilted slightly lower (smaller infection rates) in just the last couple of days, it appears that CA is beginning to show a lower, better rate. This is what I was hoping to see, even if I expected more than this little change. On the other hand, a change in infection rate should show up after about two weeks, so we are just edging into that regime. Yesterday, the day after I noticed the slight downturn in infection rates, I saw an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, entitled \"Coronavirus slowing in Bay Area? Experts track data to see whether shelter in place is working.\" The article said:",

I could not even find any historical data listing, so that I have had to enter each day's data by hand and keep my own historical dataset. These failures of the on-line world to give me what I wanted are cultural failures of our society with respect to supporting widespread computational literacy.

We asked students to take data on the heating/cooling of two objects, at different temperatures, in thermal contact. We looked at the graphs, thought about how and why that happened (it's exponential decay; instead of change being proportional to amount (infections), change in temperature is proportional to the difference of temperatures). We then collaboratively developed a program embodying their model. In diSessa (2017) you can read about how one group of high school students developed, on their own and with no instruction, a normative model of temperature equilibration. In diSessa (2008) you can read several cases of students building conceptual and computational models of fundamental scientific principles, including early versions of our temperature equilibration curriculum unit. Indeed, in a later edition of the same project, we did teach eight grade students (from a marginalized, immigrant population) how to think about exponential growth (in the form of spreading rumors; \"each one tells two\").",
