Indeed, they use the host translation machinery to synthesize their proteins, and the cell provides structures and/or host factors to achieve the synthesis of viral genomes. They also use cellular proteins and/or structures for intracellular transport and posttranslational modifications. Due to the structural and functional roles of cell membranes, major steps of the life cycle of viruses also depend on cellular membranes. A classic viral life cycle can be divided into three stages: (1) early events (attachment to host cells, penetration, and uncoating) (2) viral biosynthetic events (replication of the viral genome, transcription, and translation), and (3) virion assembly and release (Fig. 1\n). Studying how viral proteins interact with host cell membranes is therefore important to understand how viruses enter host cells, replicate their genome, and produce progeny particles.",

To enter the cell, a virus needs to bind a receptor and sometimes a coreceptor before delivering its genome into the cytosol by crossing either the plasma membrane or the membrane of an endocytic vesicle. For enveloped viruses, specialized envelope glycoproteins (fusion proteins) will trigger fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane. Recent structural data on some fusion proteins allow a better understanding of how these proteins interact with cell membranes to induce the fusion process.",

Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans play this role for many viruses. Interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been documented for herpesviruses (Spear and Longnecker, 2003), papillomaviruses (Giroglou et al., 2001), paramyxovirus 3 (Bose and Banerjee, 2002), pestiviruses (Hulst et al., 2000), flaviviruses (Chen 1997, Mandl 2001), Sindbis virus (Byrnes 1998, Klimstra 1998), adenoviruses (Dechecchi et al., 2000), and adeno\u2010associated viruses (Opie 2003, Summerford 1998). In most cases, these interactions are thought to be nonspecific and probably based on electrostatic attractions between the highly charged sulfated proteoglycans and arginine residues in viral particles (Chen 1997, Hulst 2000, Klimstra 1998, Mandl 2001, Opie 2003). They provide initial docking sites, which concentrate viruses in the vicinity of the cell surface and facilitate interactions with specific receptors. For some viruses, the ability to interact with heparan sulfate is an acquired adaptation to in vitro culture (Hulst 2000, Klimstra 1998, Mandl 2001).",

            "text": "In addition to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, viruses may also interact with other types of carbohydrates. Gangliosides are receptors for murine polyomavirus and simian virus 40 (SV40) (Gilbert 2004, Tsai 2003). The polyomavirus major capsid protein VP1 binds to oligosaccharides terminating in \u03b1\u20102,3\u2010linked sialic acid present on gangliosides (Stehle et al., 1994). Sialogangliosides may also function as initial attachment receptors for rotavirus (Dormitzer 2002, Rolsma 1998). Orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins bind sialic acid groups present on glycolipids or glycoproteins (Crennell 2000, Skehel 2000). The affinity of a single interaction between an HA molecule of influenza virus or a VP1 monomer of the polyomavirus capsid and a sialic acid unit is rather low (Skehel 2000, Stehle 1994). With respect to this low affinity, sialylated proteins and lipids are therefore similar to nonspecific attachment factors. However, a strong binding is achieved through multiple contacts between the virus, which is multimeric in nature, and sialic acids, which are abundant on the surface of the cell. The clustering of gangliosides triggers intracellular signaling that promotes the uptake of the viral particle. Therefore gangliosides also play the role of specific entry receptors. Influenza particles contain a second envelope glycoprotein with neuraminidase activity, which is called NA. The NA glycoprotein hydrolyzes sialic acid from oligosaccharides. Its function is to release the virus from the cell surface if the particle is not internalized after binding, and to facilitate the release of newly formed virions from the cell surface by removing receptors for the virus. Recent data indicate that although gangliosides do function as attachment factors for influenza virus, they are not sufficient to promote entry. Internalization requires additional unidentified N\u2010linked glycoprotein(s) at a postbinding step, which may function as entry receptors (Chu and Whittaker, 2004).",

Adenoviruses have a receptor responsible for the specific attachment to target cells and another one that induces endocytosis. A number of adenoviruses (group C) bind to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Bergelson et al., 1997). CAR interacts with a conserved loop of the fiber protein of the virus and promotes its attachment to the cell surface (Bewley et al., 1999). However this binding is not sufficient to induce the uptake of the virus. Instead, integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 or \u03b1V\u03b25 association with a conserved RGD motif present on the penton base protein promotes virus internalization (Wickham et al., 1993). Both receptors are required for efficient adenovirus entry.",

CAR is a tight junction protein located at the basolateral plasma membrane in epithelia, and is engaged in homodimeric interactions between proteins located on adjacent cells. Following the infection of an individual cell of the epithelium, virions are initially released only to the basolateral surface. Together with the virus, a large excess of fiber protein is also released, which saturates CAR binding sites and dissociates CAR homodimers. This results in a local disruption of cell junctions in the epithelium, which facilitates adenovirus escape to the apical surface, and the spread of the virus.",

Cellular receptors for Herpes simplex virus 1 include nectin\u20101 and nectin\u20102, two intercellular adhesion molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. Heparan sulfate could also serve as specific receptors initiating the entry of Herpes simplex virus 1 through the interaction of 3\u2010O\u2010sulfated monosaccharide units of the proteoglycans with gD (Shukla et al., 1999). It is thought that the binding to specific receptors induces conformational changes in gD. These changes in turn activate the fusion machinery of the virion, which includes glycoproteins gH and gB, and eventually leads to the translocation of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm of the cell.",

Dynamin is a large GTPase required for the pinching off of vesicular carriers of several endocytic pathways from the plasma membrane (Hinshaw, 2000). Dominant\u2010negative forms of dynamin may thus be used to probe the requirement for endocytosis (although there are a few examples of dynamin\u2010independent endocytosis), but are not necessarily indicative of a clathrin\u2010mediated uptake. On the other hand Eps15 dominant\u2010negative forms can be used to probe functionally clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis. Eps15 is a protein that associates with AP\u20102, the major adaptor complex of clathrin\u2010coated pits at the plasma membrane. The overexpression of truncated forms of Eps15 imposes a strong blockade of clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis without affecting other internalization pathways and other intracellular transport steps controlled by clathrin (Benmerah 1998, Carbone 1997). Clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis requirement for entry has been demonstrated with the use of dominant\u2010negative forms of Eps15 for several viruses including Sindbis virus (Carbone et al., 1997), Semliki forest virus (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2002b), adenovirus\u20102 (Meier et al., 2002), Hantaan virus (Jin et al., 2002), JC virus (Querbes et al., 2004), West Nile virus (Chu and Ng, 2004), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (Lecot et al., 2005). Dominant\u2010negative forms of other proteins of the clathrin coat at the plasma membrane were used to demonstrate clathrin\u2010mediated entry of rhinovirus type 2 (Snyers et al., 2003).",

In electron microscopy studies, incoming influenza virions were detected in clathrin\u2010coated pits and vesicles and in another type of uncoated membrane invaginations and smooth\u2010walled vesicles, which were negative for incoming VSV (Matlin et al., 1981). The suppression of clathrin function with Eps15 mutants did not inhibit influenza virus infection (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2002b). This led to the hypothesis that influenza virus may use either clathrin or nonclathrin endocytic pathways for productive infection. More recently, this hypothesis was confirmed by the direct observation of the uptake of fluorescently labeled influenza virions in cells expressing YFP\u2010tagged clathrin light chain, using dual color video microscopy (Rust et al., 2004). Incoming virions were shown to enter both through clathrin\u2010coated vesicles and through a clathrin\u2010independent pathway of internalization in the same cell. The incoming virions that were internalized by a clathrin\u2010independent mechanism were not associated with caveolae. The alternative endocytic pathway of influenza virus is still poorly characterized and it is not known how it is related to the uncoated vesicles that were originally detected in electron microscopy (Matlin et al., 1981). Influenza can enter even in the presence of both Eps15 dominant\u2010negative mutant and cholesterol\u2010sequestering drugs (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2002b). This indicates that influenza virus can enter by a clathrin\u2010 and lipid raft\u2010independent pathway. Both influenza virus entry pathways appear to deliver viruses to acidic endosomes.",

            "text": "Following entry by clathrin\u2010mediated or alternative pathways, viral particles are delivered to early endosomes. Viruses may penetrate from this compartment, or be transported to late endosomes. The risk for a virus that is entering by this route is to be transported to lysosomes, the degradative compartment normally targeted by the endocytic pathway. To avoid lysosomal delivery, viruses that enter by this endocytic route have evolved mechanisms of penetration adapted to the environment of endosomes. Many viruses are activated by acidic endosomal pH, and the threshold of pH for activation usually matches the pH values of early or late endosomes. The endosomal compartment where the fusion occurs may be experimentally characterized with the GTPases Rab5 and Rab7. Rab family members are small Ras\u2010like GTPases, which regulate membrane traffic events in the endocytic and secretory pathways. Overexpression of a dominant\u2010negative form of Rab5, which controls entry into early endosomes, decreases the uptake of adenovirus (Rauma et al., 1999), rhinovirus (Snyers et al., 2003), influenza virus, Semliki forest virus, and VSV (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2003). Influenza virus is also sensitive to a dominant\u2010negative form of Rab7, which controls the transport to late endosomes (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2003). In contrast, Semliki forest virus and VSV are not affected. These observations indicate that influenza virus must reach late endosomes before being activated for fusion, and that it transits in early endosomes on route to late endosomes, whereas Semliki forest virus and VSV can fusion from within early endosomes. This is consistent with the threshold pH for the activation of influenza virus fusion protein, which is about 5.0\u20135.5 (White et al., 1981), and is in the range of pH that is found in late but not in early endosomes. For Semliki forest virus and VSV, the fusion is induced at slightly higher pH, 6.0 and 6.1, respectively (White et al., 1981), which fit with the pH of early endosomes.",

This suggests that the endocytic entry provides additional factors that are essential for a productive West Nile virus infection.

            "text": "Another cellular entry route that is provided by cells to incoming viruses is the internalization of caveolae. Caveolae are small invaginations of the plasma membrane. They represent a subdomain of cholesterol\u2010 and sphingolipid\u2010rich lipid rafts that are specifically associated with the cholesterol\u2010binding protein caveolin. Virus entry through caveolae was described with the study of SV40 (Anderson 1996, Pelkmans 2001). After binding to the cell surface SV40 is quickly transferred to preexisting caveolae. Caveolae usually are immobile at the surface of the cell, but may be induced to detach themselves from the plasma membrane by SV40\u2010triggered, tyrosine kinase\u2010mediated signaling and to move inside the cell. Caveolae internalization requires dynamin function, involves actin remodeling, and is independent of clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis. Caveolar endocytosis is characterized by a lag period at the cell surface before internalization and by slow kinetics. Caveolar endocytosis is also sensitive to agents that disrupt lipid rafts by altering the cholesterol content of membranes. However, this criterion alone cannot be used to define caveolar entry, because other endocytic pathways are also sensitive to cholesterol depletion. Caveolae are also used for entry by BK virus (Eash et al., 2004) and human echovirus type\u20101 (Pietiainen et al., 2004). In some cell types, polyomavirus could also enter through caveolae endocytosis (Gilbert and Benjamin, 2004). Based on studies with Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP\u2010pseudotyped virions, caveolae\u2010mediated entry of filoviruses was proposed (Empig and Goldsmith, 2002). However, the entry pathway of Ebola virus still remains controversial (Simmons et al., 2003b).",

In the metastable state, the fusion peptide is buried inside the structure of the fusion protein ectodomain. Following activation, the fusion peptide is exposed and inserts into the target membrane.

This results in the formation of a stalk between both membranes. This stalk generates a local hemifusion, in which a physical continuity between the external leaflets occurs without any merging of internal leaflets. A local hemifusion diaphragm may be formed by the apposed internal leaflets. In a second step of the fusion process, small pores are transiently formed in the bilayer of the hemifusion diaphragm. When one of these small pores expands or if several of them merge, the continuity of both bilayers is restored and the fusion is completed.

Mutations in viral fusion proteins have been reported, which block various steps of the fusion process. When the transmembrane domain of influenza virus fusion protein HA is replaced with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, the fusion reaction is blocked at the hemifusion state (Kemble 1994, Melikyan 1997).

The structure of a synthetic influenza HA fusion peptide (an N\u2010terminal fusion peptide) docked to lipid bilayers has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and by site\u2010directed spin\u2010labeled electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (Han et al., 2001). At pH 5, which corresponds to HA fusogenic conformation, the fusion peptide has a V\u2010shaped form, made of two amphipathic helices separated by a turn. Each helix inserts obliquely into the outer leaflet of the membrane and does not penetrate the inner leaflet. When the first residue of its fusion peptide is changed from a glycine to a serine, HA only mediates lipid exchange but no content mixing in in vitro fusion assays, indicating that the fusion mediated by this mutant is blocked at the hemifusion step (Qiao et al., 1999). Interestingly, the membrane insertion of this mutant fusion peptide appears different from that of the wild type (Li et al., 2003). These observations indicate that fusion peptides do not associate with membranes as transmembrane domains do. It is likely that whether they are located at the N\u2010terminus of the fusion protein or in an internal loop, fusion peptides do not span the lipid bilayer. It is proposed that such a mode of insertion could perturb lipid packing and facilitate lipid mixing between juxtaposed membranes (Han et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Structural data have revealed two different types of fusion proteins. Type I fusion proteins are present on the surface of the virion as spike glycoproteins, which project perpendicularly to the viral membrane. The influenza virus HA glycoprotein is the best documented type I fusion protein (Skehel and Wiley, 2000). HA is a homotrimer that is held together largely by coil\u2013coil interactions between long \u03b1\u2010helices. HA is posttranslationally processed in a late step during the assembly of the viral particle. The proteolytic cleavage leaves the fusion peptide at the N\u2010terminus of the membrane\u2010anchored fusion subunit HA2, which remains disulfide bound to the receptor\u2010binding subunit HA1. During entry, the acidic pH of late endosomes induces a dramatic conformational change, which mediates the fusion. The final postfusion state of HA is a highly stable conformation, referred to as trimer of hairpins, with the fusion peptide and the transmembrane domain located at the same end of the molecule. This suggests that the protein folds back on itself following its low pH\u2010induced activation. Type I fusion proteins are also found in retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses. Like HA, they are all cleaved into two subunits by posttranslational proteolytic processing and the cleavage is thought to generate the metastable state required for their fusion\u2010promoting function. The postfusion conformations of HIV gp41 (Eckert and Kim, 2001) and of paramyxovirus SV5 fusion protein F (Baker et al., 1999) are also trimers of hairpins, suggesting that pH\u2010dependent and pH\u2010independent type I fusion proteins mediate membrane fusion by very similar mechanisms.",

They are associated as homodimers, which are positioned parallel to the viral membrane. Their ectodomains are associated in an antiparallel manner in the homodimer (Kuhn 2002, Lescar 2001). The conformation dramatically changes when they are exposed to an acidic environment such as the inside of endosomal compartments (Allison 1995, Wahlberg 1992). The homodimers dissociate to acquire their fusogenic conformation. Following this dissociation, type II fusion proteins reorient themselves, rise up away from the bilayer of the viral envelope, and form homotrimers. An internal fusion peptide is exposed, which can insert into the target membrane (Gibbons et al., 2003). The insertion of the fusion peptide into a target membrane facilitates the formation of homotrimers (Heinz and Allison, 2000). Following membrane insertion and homotrimerization, type II fusion proteins fold back and adopt a postfusion conformation relatively similar to the trimer of hairpin conformation of type I fusion proteins, in which the transmembrane domain and the fusion peptide are in close proximity (Bressanelli 2004, Gibbons 2004, Modis 2004).",

Most viruses with a pH\u2010dependent mechanism of fusion are inactivated by pretreatment at low pH in the absence of cells.

This mode of activation combines a step of \u201cpriming\u201d by receptor binding followed by a step of activation by low pH exposure.

Reovirus penetration is under the control of the \u03bc1 viral protein. During penetration, conformational changes occur in \u03bc1, which lead to the exposure of the myristylated N\u2010terminal hydrophobic peptide. Activated \u03bc1 then inserts in the membrane of the endosome. This results in the transfer of the core into the cytosol of the target cell by an unknown mechanism. A major difference between poliovirus and reovirus penetration lies in the mode of activation. Whereas poliovirus is activated by receptor interactions, reovirus penetration is initially triggered by the endosomal environment. However, in the case of reovirus the acidic pH of endosomes is not responsible for the activation. Reovirus penetration is triggered by the proteolytic degradation of \u03c33, a protein that interacts with \u03bc1 in the viral particle. This proteolytic degradation of \u03c33, which releases \u03bc1 in its activated form, is mediated by endosomal cathepsins L and B (Ebert et al., 2002).",

            "text": "In the case of rotavirus entry, conformational transformations associated with membrane penetration have been defined by structural data. Two consecutive transformations occur in VP4, the major spike protein of the virion (Dormitzer et al., 2004). VP4 is first primed by trypsin cleavage in the intestinal lumen before cell entry. This converts VP4 from a flexible undefined state into spikes made of VP4 dimers, which project away from the surface of the virion and present receptor\u2010binding sites at the top of the spike. Then, unknown cellular events trigger dramatic structural rearrangements in primed VP4 during entry. VP4 associates in trimers through coil\u2013coil interactions of \u03b1\u2010helices, a potential membrane\u2010interacting loop rich in glycine and hydrophobic residues is exposed at the top of the spike by shedding of the receptor\u2010binding subunit, and the trimer of cleaved VP4 adopts a final conformation in which each subunit folds back in a conformation reminiscent of trimers of hairpins formed by membrane fusion proteins of enveloped viruses. The mechanism of action of rotavirus VP4 is thus very similar in principle to that of fusion proteins, with a proteolytic cleavage step that activates VP4 and a cellular signal that triggers structural transformation of the protein and the formation of a final, folded\u2010back conformation, in which the membrane\u2010interacting loop is located close to the C\u2010terminal domain that anchors the protein in the virion. How this structural transformation actually leads to the transfer of the virion across the membrane is not yet understood.",

It is generally assumed that it involves the formation of a pore\u2010like structure, as in poliovirus entry (Hogle, 2002), or the lysis of the endosome, as in adenovirus entry (FitzGerald et al., 1983). The lytic activity of adenovirus capsid is borne by the penton protein. Rhinoviruses appear to use either pore formation or membrane rupture in endosomes for endosomal escape, depending on the serotype (Schober et al., 1998). However, the molecular mechanisms leading to endosomal membrane rupture are not understood. For parvoviruses, a phospholipase A2 activity has been identified in the N\u2010terminal extension of the capsid protein VP1 (Zadori et al., 2001). This phospholipase is required for endosomal escape. It is proposed that this domain, which is positioned inside the capsid in the native virion, is exposed following exposure to low pH in late endosomes, and acts on phospholipids of the endosomal membrane to facilitate the egress of the particle.",

            "text": "Interactions between cellular membranes and poliovirus replication have been extensively described. After virion entry, the incoming poliovirus genome migrates to specific perinuclear sites, where the genome is directly translated by the cellular machinery. The synthesis of the viral polyprotein takes place in association with cytoplasmic membranes. Soon after translation, newly synthesized nonstructural viral proteins become associated with the viral RNA into an RNA replication complex, which is assembled on intracellular membranes (Bienz 1987, Bienz 1990). Poliovirus replication complexes consist of groups of vesicles of 70\u2013400nm in diameter, and after isolation become associated as large rosette\u2010like shells of many vesicles interconnected with tubular extensions (Bienz et al., 1992). In vitro, the rosettes can dissociate reversibly into tubular vesicles, and are able to resume RNA synthesis (Bienz et al., 1992). Immunoisolated poliovirus\u2010specific vesicles contain viral nonstructural proteins, and cellular markers of the ER, lysosomes, and trans\u2010Golgi network, suggesting a complex biogenesis of the RNA replication complexes (Schlegel et al., 1996). Electron microscopy analyses indicated that intracellular membrane rearrangements in poliovirus\u2010infected cells lead to the formation of double\u2010membrane vesicles similar to immature autophagic vacuoles carrying markers from the early and late secretory pathways (Suhy et al., 2000).",

            "text": "The use of drugs targeting the secretory pathway of the host cell contributed to elucidating the biogenesis of the poliovirus replication complex. Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal macrocyclic lactone that has multiple targets in vesicular transport, and blocks membrane traffic between the ER and the cis\u2010 and trans\u2010Golgi compartments, leading to the disruption of the trans\u2010Golgi apparatus (Nebenfuhr et al., 2002). BFA completely inhibits viral RNA synthesis in poliovirus\u2010infected cells (Irurzun 1992, Maynell 1992) as well as in an in vitro system (Cuconati et al., 1998). The role of membrane trafficking and subcellular localization of viral RNA replication was further defined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Poliovirus vesicles are generated at the ER by the cellular COPII budding mechanism, and are homologous to the vesicles of the anterograde membrane transport pathway (Rust et al., 2001). ER resident proteins are excluded from the released vesicles, which are not destined to the Golgi apparatus, but that accumulate in the cytoplasm (Rust et al., 2001). These results are consistent with other observations, showing that poliovirus infection inhibits the transport of both plasma membrane and secretory proteins. This transport inhibition does not require viral RNA replication or the inhibition of host cell translation by poliovirus (Doedens and Kirkegaard, 1995). During poliovirus infection, cells undergo extensive proliferation and rearrangement of intracellular smooth membranes and loss of ER membranes takes place (Cho et al., 1994). Furthermore, the addition of cerulenin, an inhibitor of phospholipid synthesis, to poliovirus\u2010infected cells results in inhibition of (1) the synthesis of the progeny genome, (2) the synthesis of phospholipids, and (3) the proliferation of membranes, indicating that continuous phospholipid synthesis is required for efficient genomic replication (Guinea and Carrasco, 1990). Egger and co\u2010workers (2000) proposed that a functional poliovirus replication complex is assembled in a coupled and complex process involving viral translation, modification of membranes and budding, and viral RNA synthesis.",

As opposed to poliovirus 2B, the overexpression of protein 2C does not disrupt glycoprotein trafficking of VSV G protein to the plasma membrane (Suhy et al., 2000). The sequence responsible for membrane binding of 2C has been mapped to its N\u2010terminal region, which has been predicted to fold into an amphipathic \u03b1\u2010helix (Echeverri 1995, Paul 1994, Teterina 1997). Poliovirus 2C protein displays ATPase (Pfister et al., 2000) and GTPase activities (Rodriguez and Carrasco, 1993) and is involved in genomic replication (Banerjee et al., 1997). Poliovirus 2BC, like 2B, is also a membrane protein, which interferes with the vesicular transport in both animal and yeast cells (Aldabe 1996, Doedens 1995). Thus, the 2B moiety in the 2BC protein accounts for transport inhibition (Doedens and Kirkegaard, 1995). The 2BC protein induces vesicles similar to those observed in poliovirus\u2010infected cells, and causes an increase in permeability of the plasma membrane, like 2B (Teterina et al., 1997).",

The 3A protein remains associated with ER membranes but can be delivered into vesicles, similar to those found in infected cells and by expression of 2BC (Dodd et al., 2001). In poliovirus\u2010infected cells, the 3AB precursor contains a 22\u2010amino acid\u2013long sequence corresponding to 3B and called VPg. Only the membrane\u2010associated 3AB protein can be cleaved by the viral proteases (3Cpro and 3CDpro), and thus serves as the source of VPg (Lama et al., 1994). The 3AB precursor associates tightly with cellular membranes, resembling the binding of integral membrane proteins (Datta and Dasgupta, 1994). The binding domain has been mapped to the C\u2010terminal region, within a hydrophobic sequence (Towner et al., 1996). However, the exact binding mechanism is not known. The 3B (VPg) portion of 3AB has affinity to the catalytic subunit 3Dpol and its precursor 3CD, which in turn recruits the template RNA into the membrane\u2010associated replication complex by interaction with 3C and 3D (Egger et al., 2000).",

For hepatitis C virus (HCV), the viral polyprotein is synthesized on ER\u2010associated ribosomes, and is cleaved co\u2010 and posttranslationally by cellular and viral proteases into the mature structural and nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural proteins involved in replication (NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) have been shown to interact with ER membranes (Dubuisson et al., 2002) (Fig. 6\n). However, the soluble protease/helicase NS3 protein associates with the membrane by interaction with NS4A, a cofactor of the protease domain of NS3. NS4A is a 54\u2010amino acid cofactor for both serine protease and helicase activities of NS3, and its cofactor activity requires stable complex formation between NS3 and NS4A, an interaction that also stabilizes NS3 (Bartenschlager 1995, Pang 2002, Tanji 1995). NS3 is found in association with ER or ER\u2010like membranes when coexpressed with NS4A, but it is distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus when expressed in the absence of NS4A (Wolk et al., 2000). Deletion analyses have shown that the hydrophobic N\u2010terminal domain of NS4A is required to target NS3 to ER membranes.",

Interestingly, an intact N\u2010terminal amphipathic helix can mediate correct membrane association of HCV nonstructural proteins and RNA replication, indicating a role for NS4B in the formation of membrane structures required for RNA replication (Elazar et al., 2004). Expression of NS4B induces the formation of a seemingly ER\u2010derived membranous web that is able to harbor all HCV structural and nonstructural proteins (Egger et al., 2002). When NS4B is expressed alone, its association with ER membranes occurs cotranslationally, presumably via engagement of the signal recognition particle by an internal signal peptide (Hugle et al., 2001), but no canonical signal peptide has been identified.

The conserved C\u2010terminal 21\u2010amino acid residues of NS5B are necessary and sufficient to target NS5B to the cytosolic side of ER membranes (Schmidt\u2010Mende et al., 2001). Membrane association of NS5B occurs by a posttranslational mechanism and results in integral membrane association and cytosolic orientation of the functional protein domain (Schmidt\u2010Mende et al., 2001). Within membrane proteins, NS5B has been classified as a tail\u2010anchored protein (Kutay 1993, Wattenberg 2001). Recent results have demonstrated that the NS5B insertion sequence crosses the membrane phospholipid bilayer as a transmembrane segment (Ivashkina et al., 2002). NS5B has been shown to be retained in the ER or an ER\u2010derived modified compartment following transient transfection or in the context of a subgenomic replicon (Schmidt\u2010Mende et al., 2001). Interestingly, in addition to being a membrane anchor, the conserved C\u2010terminal region of NS5B, in vitro, can regulate the polymerase activity modulating template binding and NTP substrate selection (Adachi 2002, Leveque 2003, Vo 2004), and in vivo is essential for viral RNA replication (Lee 2004, Moradpour 2004).",

Membrane fractionation by sedimentation has been used to purify Kunjin virus replication complexes. Ultrastructural analyses have shown that the characteristics of flavivirus\u2010induced membranes are associated with purified RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase activity. RNA polymerase\u2010active fractions were shown to contain nonstructural proteins as well as genomic replicative forms (Chu and Westaway, 1992). Systematic electron microscopy analyses of Kunjin virus\u2010infected cells have revealed dramatic morphological changes and proliferation of the ER. Three different membrane structures have been identified: convoluted membranes (CM), paracrystalline structures (PC), and vesicle packets (VP) of smooth membranes (Westaway et al., 1999). Most viral nonstructural proteins and the replicating RNA have been localized to VPs, which are derived from trans\u2010Golgi membranes late during infection (Mackenzie et al., 1999). VPs are sacs of vesicles surrounded by a membrane with a diameter of about 50\u2013100nm. Importantly, unlike CMs and PCs, these VPs are not observed following expression of Kunjin virus subgenomic replicons (Khromykh and Westaway, 1997). In these cells, the replicating RNA localized throughout the cytoplasm in small isolated foci, suggesting that not all the structures induced by the nonstructural proteins are sites of RNA replication (Mackenzie 2001, Westaway 1999). Comparison between replicon cell lines producing RNA and nonstructural proteins with different efficiencies suggests that induction of virus\u2010specific membranes is dose dependent, and requires a certain level of expression of viral products (Mackenzie et al., 2001).",

After detergent solubilization, this BMV RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase activity copurifies with an immunoprecipitable complex of viral proteins 1a and 2a and several host factors (Quadt 1993, Quadt 1995). An equivalent, initially membrane\u2010bound BMV RNA polymerase activity can be isolated from yeast expressing the BMV 1a and 2a proteins and replicating BMV RNA derivatives (Quadt et al., 1995). The BMV 2a protein contains a central RNA polymerase domain and an N\u2010terminal domain that interacts with the 1a helicase domain (Kao and Ahlquist, 1992). Since 1a and 2a proteins lack obvious membrane\u2010spanning domains, the nature of their association with membranes has been investigated. In BMV\u2010infected protoplasts, 1a, 2a, and viral\u2010specific RNA synthesis show colocalization in cytoplasmic spots surrounding the nucleus. Detection of organelle markers shows that BMV replication complexes are tightly associated with the ER, but not the medial Golgi or later compartments of the secretory pathway (Restrepo\u2010Hartwig and Ahlquist, 1996). In addition, the 1a protein has been shown to associate with the ER when expressed in the absence of other viral factors, indicating that this protein may be responsible for ER localization and retention of the BMV RNA replication complex (Restrepo\u2010Hartwig and Ahlquist, 1999). The 1a protein is located on the cytoplasmic face of the ER, and mapping experiments of the targeting determinant indicated that a large region at the N\u2010terminus of this protein is required for membrane association and ER targeting, but the exact mechanism of insertion is unknown (den Boon et al., 2001). In contrast, the predicted RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase 2a depends on 1a protein for recruitment to the site of replication (Kao 1992, O'Reilly 1995, O'Reilly 1997). The recruitment of 2a protein is based on a direct interaction between the N\u2010terminus of 2a and the C\u2010terminus of 1a and is reflected in a 1a\u2010induced increase of 2a accumulation (Chen 2001, Ishikawa 1997). The 1a protein also recruits viral RNA templates into replication, resulting in dramatically increased RNA stability but reduced translation (Janda 1998, Sullivan 1999).",

The interior of these spherules remains connected to the cytoplasm via a membranous neck contiguous with the ER membrane. The 1a protein is also able to promote membrane lipid accumulation at an intracellular level (Lee and Ahlquist, 2003). When viral RNA is coexpressed with the 1a protein, it becomes protected inside the spherule in a membrane\u2010associated, nuclease\u2010resistant state. When viral polymerase 2a is coexpressed, it associates with the spherules through interaction with the 1a protein, and viral replication takes place in close association with the spherules, possibly in their interior, from which plus\u2010strand RNA is released to the cellular cytoplasm.",

A screen for host genes essential for BMV RNA replication has identified a partial loss\u2010of\u2010function mutation in the OLE1 gene. This mutation severely inhibits BMV RNA replication (Lee et al., 2001). OLE1 is an essential gene encoding the delta9 fatty acid desaturase required for synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Under restrictive conditions, the 1a protein can still normally recruit viral RNA and 2a protein to membranes, but replication is strongly inhibited (Lee et al., 2001). Limiting synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids does not reduce membrane synthesis, but a low ratio of unsaturated\u2010to\u2010saturated fatty acids in membrane phospholipids can affect membrane fluidity (Stuckey et al., 1989). Furthermore, using the yeast OLE1 mutant, it has been shown that perinuclear ER spherules induced by 1a are locally depleted of unsaturated fatty acids, suggesting that 1a preferentially binds with one or more types of membrane lipids (Lee and Ahlquist, 2003).",

TMV also encodes a movement protein (MP) required for cell\u2010to\u2010cell movement (Deom et al., 1987), and a 17.5K protein (CP). These two latter proteins are dispensable for replication (Meshi et al., 1987). Biochemical fractionation of TMV\u2010infected protoplasts has shown that membrane fractions contain active replication complexes (Osman and Buck, 1996). Cytological analyses of TMV\u2010infected cells have shown virus replication complexes associated with cytoplasmic inclusions or viroplasms, consisting of membrane rearrangements and amorphous proliferation of the ER, which expand throughout the infection. These inclusions contain ribosomes, microtubules, viral RNA, MP, and 126/183\u2010kDa replication proteins (Hills 1987, Saito 1987). Recent studies with TMV expressing a fusion GFP:MP protein showed fluorescent irregularly shaped structures derived from the ER membranes, colocalization of the TMV RNA with BiP, and disruption of fluorescent structures by BFA (Heinlein 1998, Mas 1999). Immunostaining with tubulin provided evidence of colocalization of TMV RNA with microtubules, and disruption of the cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D generated severe changes in TMV RNA distribution (Mas 1999, Reichel 1998).",

From these studies, it has been found that only nsP1 displays a specific association with cellular membranes (Peranen et al., 1995). Biochemical and genetic experiments have shown that Semliki forest virus nsP1 is highly associated with cellular membranes by two mechanisms: (1) palmitoylation of cysteine residues within nsP1 (Laakkonen et al., 1996) and (2) a membrane\u2010binding domain of approximately 20 conserved amino acids (Lampio et al., 2000). However, palmitoylation of nsP1 is not essential for virus replication, although virus release is delayed when palmitoylated residues are mutated (Ahola et al., 2000). In addition, both enzymatic activities of Semliki forest virus nsP1 (methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase) are inactivated by detergents and reactivated by anionic phospholipids, like phosphatidylserine (Ahola and Ahlquist, 1999). Thus, binding to anionic phospholipids causes a conformational change, which activates nsP1 protein. Mutagenesis of putative essential amino acid residues interacting with membranes leads to alteration of virus production (Salonen et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Studies of Semliki forest virus nonstructural proteins expressed individually or as a polyprotein have shown that these proteins need to be synthesized as a polyprotein precursor to assemble a replication complex (Salonen et al., 2003). Uncleaved polyproteins containing nsP1 are membrane bound and palmitoylated, and those containing nsP3 are phosphorylated, reflecting properties of authentic nsP1 and nsP3, respectively (Salonen et al., 2003). Interestingly, uncleaved P12 precursor is localized almost exclusively to the plasma membrane and filopodia, like nsP1 expressed alone, whereas uncleaved P123 and uncleaved P1234 are found on cytoplasmic vesicles, some of which contain late endosomal markers. Thus, the nsP1 domain alone is responsible for the membrane association of the nonstructural polyprotein, whereas the nsP1 domain together with the nsP3 domain targets the nonstructural proteins to the intracellular vesicles (Salonen et al., 2003). It has therefore been proposed that the polyprotein is attached to membranes first by the nsP1\u2010binding domain, which adopts an \u03b1\u2010helical conformation (Salonen et al., 2005). Thereafter, the nsP1 domain of the polyprotein undergoes a conformational change to activate both methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities (Ahola et al., 1999). The palmitoylation of cysteine residues on nsP1 will then anchor the polyprotein irreversibly to the membrane. The polyprotein has a half\u2010life of about 15min (Kujala et al., 2001). The initial cleavage releases nsP4 from the polyprotein precursor, giving rise to the minus\u2010strand polymerase complex. During this time, a replication complex likely synthesizes only minus\u2010strand RNA before it is transformed into a stable plus\u2010strand polymerase, which operates as the unit of replication within the spherule.",

The 140K protein localizes to the chloroplast envelope in the absence of any other viral factors, and thus seems to be a major determinant for chloroplast localization and retention of viral replication complexes (Prod'homme et al., 2003). In contrast, the 66K protein, encompassing the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase domain, has a cytoplasmic distribution when expressed alone and depends on the 140K protein for recruitment to the sites of replication (Prod'homme et al., 2003). The recruitment of the 66K protein to the replication complexes involves protein\u2013protein interactions with the membrane\u2010bound 140K protein (Jakubiec et al., 2004). Interestingly, using a two\u2010hybrid system and coimmunoprecipitation, the interaction domains were mapped to the proteinase domain of the 140K protein and to a large region encompassing the core polymerase domain within the 66K protein (Jakubiec et al., 2004). Since many viral families assemble their replication complexes via protein\u2013protein interactions of helicase and polymerase domains (Johansson 2001, Kao 1992, Kim 2002, O'Reilly 1995, O'Reilly 1997, Van Der Heijden 2001), turnip yellow mosaic virus follows a new pathway to assemble its RNA replication complex on cellular membranes.",

Moreover, the membrane and phospholipids dependence of flock house virus RNA positive\u2010strand synthesis imply that membrane association is crucial for at least some steps of genome replication (Wu et al., 1992). Electron microscopy studies after viral infections demonstrate the appearance of vesicular bodies in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Garzon et al., 1990). The vesicular bodies contain RNA, have morphological characteristics of mitochondria at early stages of infection, and are associated with virus particles at later stages of infection (Garzon et al., 1990).",

Flock house virus infection induces the formation of membrane\u2010bound spherules of 40\u201360nm in diameter in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Miller et al., 2001). Expression in heterologous systems defined flock house virus protein A as an outer mitochondrial transmembrane protein with an N\u2010terminus located in the intermembrane space or matrix, and the C\u2010terminus exposed to the cytoplasm.

Two ER sorting signals have been well defined for transmembrane proteins (Teasdale and Jackson, 1996). Type II transmembrane proteins possess a motif consisting of two arginines near the cytoplasmic N\u2010terminus. Type I transmembrane proteins contain lysines at positions \u22123 and either at position \u22124 or \u22125 in relation to the cytoplasmic C\u2010terminus (dilysine or KKXX motif). Interestingly, a functional dilysine motif is commonly found at the C\u2010terminus of primate spumaviruses (Goepfert et al., 1997). This localization directs budding of these spumaviruses to intracellular membranes (Shaw et al., 2003). Although the dilysine motif of spumaviruses imposes a partial restriction on the site of viral maturation, it is not necessary for virion formation (Goepfert et al., 1999).",

Dilysine signals have been shown to direct retrieval of escaped proteins from post\u2010ER compartments back to the ER. Proteins with a dilysine signal bind the coatomer complex (COPI) and are recruited into vesicles that travel in a retrograde direction (Cosson 1994, Gaynor 1998).

The mature M protein accumulates in the Golgi apparatus and is not transported to the plasma membrane (Lai and Holmes, 2001). The information for the intracellular localization of M resides within the first transmembrane domain (Swift and Machamer, 1991) and, additionally, in the carboxyl\u2010terminal portion (Locker et al., 1994). The small hydrophobic membrane protein E has also been reported to transiently reside in a pre\u2010Golgi compartment (Lim and Liu, 2001) before it progresses to the Golgi apparatus (Corse 2000, Corse 2002). Interestingly, the M protein is able to interact with itself and with S and E proteins (Corse 2003, de Haan 1999, de Haan 2000, Lim 2001). These interactions likely contribute to retaining all the envelope proteins at the site of budding.",

Virion morphogenesis of the flaviviruses occurs in association with ER membranes, suggesting that there should be accumulation of the virion components in this compartment (Mackenzie and Westaway, 2001). ER localization signals have been identified in the transmembrane regions of flavivirus envelope proteins (Op De Beeck et al., 2004). These domains also play an essential role in the formation of the flavivirus envelope (Op De Beeck et al., 2003). The C\u2010termini of prM and E form two antiparallel transmembrane \u03b1\u2010helices potentially making coiled\u2010coil structures, leaving the C\u2010terminus of each protein in the lumen of the ER (Zhang et al., 2003) (Fig. 8\n). Interestingly, the first transmembrane passage contains enough information for ER localization (Op De Beeck et al., 2004). It has been proposed that in the absence of dominant luminal or cytosolic associations, proteins distribute based on interactions between their transmembrane domain and the surrounding lipid environment (Bretcher 1993, Munro 1995). A similar transmembrane\u2010based sorting might exist in the ER and might lead to ER retention of protein having a short transmembrane domain (Pedrazzini 1996, Szczesna\u2010Skorupa 2000, Yang 1997). A similar mechanism seems to be involved in ER retention of the flavivirus envelope proteins. Indeed, the first transmembrane passage of E contains enough information for ER localization and increasing the length of this transmembrane passage leads to export out of the ER (Op De Beeck et al., 2004).",

Sequence analyses indicate that these domains are all composed of two hydrophobic stretches separated by a small connecting segment containing one or more charged residues (Cocquerel et al., 2000). However, they have different structures (Op De Beeck and Dubuisson, 2003) (Fig. 8). Indeed, the transmembrane domains of HCV envelope glycoproteins form a hairpin structure before cleavage of the polyprotein by a host signal peptidase, and a reorientation of the second hydrophobic stretch occurs after cleavage to produce a single membrane\u2010spanning domain (Cocquerel et al., 2002). Interestingly, the charged residue(s) present in the middle of these transmembrane domains have been shown to be essential for ER retention (Cocquerel et al., 2000), as in the case of some other ER proteins (Bonifacino 1990, Bonifacino 1991, Letourneur 1998, Yang 1997).",

When Gn of most viruses of this family is expressed on its own, it localizes to this organelle. In contrast, the Gc glycoprotein remains in the ER when it is expressed alone and is transported to the Golgi only after interaction with Gn (Schmaljohn and Hooper, 2001). The mapping of the Golgi retention signal has been done for several bunyaviruses. However, no consensus motif has been delineated. It seems that different viruses in this diverse family have developed their own specific strategy for Golgi trafficking rather than displaying a consensus Golgi retention motif. The signal for Golgi localization has been mapped to the cytoplasmic tail of the Gn protein for Uukuniemi virus (Andersson 1997, Andersson 1998). A region including the transmembrane domain and part of the cytoplasmic tail is responsible for Golgi localization of Gn for the Punta Tora (Matsuoka et al., 1996) and the Rift Valley fever (Gerrard and Nichol, 2002) phleboviruses. The signal for retention in the Golgi apparatus has been mapped to the transmembrane domain of the Bunyamwera virus (Shi et al., 2004). No specific Golgi localization signal has been found in Hantavirus glycoproteins. In this case, localization of the glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus requires the coexpression of both Gn and Gc. Interestingly, these proteins are retained in the ER when they are expressed separately (Shi 2002, Spiropoulou 2003).",

However, unlike the envelope proteins of other Togaviridae, rubella virus envelope glycoproteins are mainly retained in the Golgi apparatus. A Golgi retention signal has been identified in the transmembrane domain of E2 (Hobman et al., 1995). Interestingly, when expressed alone, E1 glycoprotein is retained in the ER, indicating that E1 needs to interact with E2 to leave the ER compartment (Hobman et al., 1997).

            "text": "Retroviruses are generally assumed to bud at the plasma membrane. However, it has recently become apparent that some of these viruses use the endocytic pathway to coordinate their assembly and release (Pelchen\u2010Matthews et al., 2004). HIV\u20101 envelope (Env) glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor and is processed during its passage through the secretory pathway by a host cell protease to yield the surface subunit (SU) and the transmembrane (TM) subunit. The TM subunit contains a C\u2010terminal cytoplasmic domain of more than 150 amino acids. Newly synthesized HIV\u20101 Env undergoes endocytosis after its arrival at the cell surface. Internalization of HIV\u20101 Env is mediated by interaction of the AP\u20102 clathrin adaptor complexes with a membrane\u2010proximal, tyrosine\u2010based signal in the cytoplasmic domain of the TM subunit (Berlioz\u2010Torrent 1999, Boge 1998, Ohno 1997). Additional determinants downstream of the proximal tyrosine\u2010based sorting signal are also implicated in HIV\u20101 Env endocytosis (Berlioz\u2010Torrent et al., 1999). The cytoplasmic domain of HIV\u20101 Env has been shown to interact with AP\u20101 adaptor complexes (Berlioz\u2010Torrent 1999, Wyss 2001), and a dileucine motif at the C\u2010terminus of the cytoplasmic domain of the TM subunit is implicated in the recruitment of AP\u20101 complexes. This dileucine motif, together with the membrane\u2010proximal tyrosine\u2010based motif, helps to control expression of Env at the cell surface (Wyss et al., 2001). In addition, two other amino acid sequences, which inhibit Env surface expression, have also been identified in the cytoplasmic domain of the TM subunit (Bultmann et al., 2001). Recently, a diaromatic motif located in the cytoplasmic tail of HIV\u20101 Env has been shown to interact with TIP47, a cellular protein that drives its retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans\u2010Golgi network (Blot et al., 2003). Interestingly, retrograde transport of Env is implicated in the optimization of fully infectious HIV\u20101 production.",

            "text": "Viruses that assemble and bud from the plasma membrane do not bud randomly, but bud asymmetrically from the surface of polarized epithelial cells (Compans, 1995). For infection of host organisms, epithelial cells of the respiratory or the gastrointestinal tract are often the primary targets for replication. Epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces establish polarity and develop two distinct membrane domains. These membrane domains are exposed to very different physiological environments because the apical membrane faces the lumen, while the basolateral membrane is in contact with the underlying stratum of the epithelia. The two poles of the cell exhibit distinct profiles of proteins and lipids. The apical plasma membrane is enriched in sphingolipids, whereas the basolateral membrane predominantly contains glycolipids, phosphatidylcholines. Tight junctions in polarized cells prevent lateral diffusion of these lipids. At the end of the infectious cycle, some viruses are released preferentially from the apical surface, thus favoring the establishment of a localized infection. Conversely, viruses that are released from the basolateral membrane find access to the underlying tissue and the blood system, facilitating the development of a systemic infection. For instance, orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses have been found to bud preferentially from the apical membrane of polarized cells, whereas VSV and Marburg virus bud almost exclusively from the basolateral surface (Schmitt and Lamb, 2004). For many viruses that exhibit polarized budding in epithelial cells, it has been found that the viral envelope glycoproteins are targeted intrinsically to the same membrane from which a virus buds. However, altering the subcellular localization of viral envelope glycoproteins does not necessarily lead to the selection of another budding site in polarized cells (Nayak et al., 2004). Signals for apical sorting have been mapped in the transmembrane domains of the two influenza virus glycoproteins HA and NA (Schmitt and Lamb, 2004). The basolateral sorting signal in glycoprotein G of VSV has been identified as a short tyrosine\u2010containing sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of this protein (Thomas and Roth, 1994). Similarly, a tyrosine motif has also been implicated in the basolateral sorting of the Env protein of some retroviruses (Lodge et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Among the host components that are intimately involved in regulating the budding process, there is growing evidence that lipids play an important role. The lipid composition of viruses budding from the plasma membrane such as apical or basolateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells is not necessarily the same as the average lipid composition of these membranes. This suggests that viruses bud from specific microdomains present within these membranes. Accumulating evidence suggests that sphingolipids and cholesterol can become segregated from other membrane lipids to form ordered lipid microdomains, called rafts, floating in a glycerophospholipid\u2010rich environment (Simons and Ikonen, 2000). Raft lipids are probably held together weakly, establishing a dynamic equilibrium of raft and nonraft regions within the plasma membrane. There is mounting evidence that lipid rafts play a role in the assembly pathway of some enveloped viruses (Chazal and Gerlier, 2003). Indeed, some viral envelope glycoproteins have been found to be enriched within membrane rafts of infected cells. For instance, in influenza A\u2010infected cells, the envelope glycoproteins HA and NA are found to be associated with rafts (Schmitt and Lamb, 2004). In addition, HA and NA from purified influenza virions were found to be associated with a membrane that had solubility properties characteristic of membrane rafts, suggesting that the virion envelope is composed of a raft membrane and that the virus buds through rafts. However, assembly of viral proteins on raft membranes does not appear to be used by all the viruses that bud from the plasma membrane. Indeed, the viral proteins of some viruses like VSV and rabies virus are excluded from raft membranes in infected cells. In addition, not all the viral proteins that assemble at raft domains in infected cells possess specific raft\u2010targeting signals. For instance, the measles virus F glycoprotein is associated with rafts when expressed alone, but not the H glycoprotein (Vincent et al., 2000). However, the H glycoprotein is associated with raft membranes in measles virus\u2010infected cells (Manie 2000, Vincent 2000). Interestingly, when coexpressed with the F glycoprotein, H is recruited to rafts. The association of viral envelope glycoproteins with rafts occurs during Golgi maturation (Chazal and Gerlier, 2003). It has indeed been proposed that raft assembly occurs in the Golgi apparatus (Simons and Ikonen, 1997). Signals for addressing HA and NA into lipid rafts have been mapped to the transmembrane domains, particularly the amino acids predicted to span the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer (Nayak et al., 2004). Interestingly, signals for apical transport of these proteins in polarized epithelial cells also reside in the transmembrane domains. However, the two types of signals are not identical. Indeed, it is possible to mutate the signal for raft association in influenza virus glycoproteins without altering apical targeting (Barman 2000, Barman 2001, Lin 1998). The cytoplasmic tails of influenza virus glycoproteins have also been found to play a role in the association with rafts (Zhang et al., 2000a).",

In a polarized and differentiated intestinal cell line, rotaviruses are released from the apical surface through a nonconventional pathway that bypasses the Golgi apparatus (Jourdan et al., 1997). It has been shown that rafts may be involved in this atypical pathway (Sapin et al., 2002). Indeed, an important proportion of VP4, the most external viral protein that forms the spikes of mature virions, associates with lipid rafts and is targeted to the apical membrane early. Later on, other structural viral proteins and viral infectivity also cosegregate with the raft fractions (Cuadras 2003, Sapin 2002). This suggests that lipid rafts may serve as a platform for the final step of rotavirus assembly.",

Matrix proteins have intrinsic membrane\u2010binding properties, and they have been shown to play a critical role in virus assembly and budding (Garoff et al., 1998).

Expression of Gag is largely sufficient to induce virus assembly and budding at the plasma membrane, which leads to the release of virus\u2010like particles (VLPs). In immature viral particles, proteolytic processing generates several distinct products, including MA (matrix protein), CA (capsid protein), and NC (nucleocapsid protein), thus producing mature infectious particles. The membrane\u2010binding domain of the MA protein directs the association of Gag with membrane, typically through a bipartite motif consisting of a covalently attached myristic acid moiety and a highly basic domain (Yuan 1993, Zhou 1994). There is considerable evidence that the N\u2010terminal myristyl group of MA protein plays a role in regulating membrane binding (Tang et al., 2004). The affinity of MA expressed alone is substantially lower than when expressed in the context of Gag precursor. It has been shown that myristate exposure is coupled with trimerization, with the myristyl group sequestered in the monomer and exposed in the trimer. The equilibrium constant is shifted toward the trimeric, myristate\u2010exposed species in Gag, indicating that exposure is enhanced by Gag subdomains that promote self\u2010association (Tang et al., 2004) (Fig. 9\n).",

The membrane binding of these matrix proteins does not display typical features of peripheral membrane proteins but rather is found to be very stable to salt or high\u2010pH treatments (Schmitt and Lamb, 2004). Even if membrane association is a common feature of matrix proteins, there is no striking common motif evident for membrane interaction. This is likely due to the lack of structural homology between matrix proteins of different virus families (Timmins et al., 2004). In the case of Ebola virus, the matrix protein is composed of two related \u03b2\u2010sandwich domains, which are connected by a flexible linker (Dessen et al., 2000). The C\u2010terminal domain has been shown to mediate membrane association (Timmins et al., 2004). More recently, it has been shown that the C\u2010terminal 18 amino acids of Ebola matrix protein play a major role in oligomerization and interaction with lipid rafts at the plasma membrane, suggesting that this sequence might directly interact with components of rafts at the plasma membrane (Panchal et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus contains a nucleocapsid surrounded by an envelope containing three membrane proteins: the large (L), the middle (M), and the small (S) envelope proteins (Ganem and Schneider, 2001). These envelope proteins are expressed from a single open reading frame by differential translation initiation. As a result, the sequence of S is repeated at the C termini of M and L. These envelope proteins show a complex transmembrane topology (Fig. 10\n). Curiously, the transmembrane topology of about half of the L protein changes drastically after translation (Ganem and Schneider, 2001). This alternative topology leads to the exposure of the preS domain of the L protein on the luminal side of the ER (e\u2010preS), whereas the other keeps the preS domain in the cytosol (i\u2010preS). Importantly, the two topologies provide separate functions to the L protein. Indeed, the e\u2010preS domain is exposed on the surface of the virion and participates in virus receptor binding (Urban and Gripon, 2002), whereas the i\u2010preS domain is important for interaction with the nucleocapsid (Bruss, 2004). The envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus play a major role in virus budding. Patients infected by this virus release subviral particles that contain predominantly the S protein with variable amounts of M and only trace quantities of L subunits (Ganem and Schneider, 2001). In addition, expression of S protein alone also leads to the production of subviral particles, indicating that the viral information necessary for this assembly process resides in the S domain. These subviral particles are assembled in a pre\u2010Golgi compartment. The envelopment of the hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid depends on viral envelope proteins. The S and L proteins, but not the M protein, are required for this process (Bruss, 2004). The nucleocapsid is incorporated into particles by interaction of the i\u2010preS domain of the L protein.",

Coronaviruses have been shown to assemble in a pre\u2010Golgi compartment, and as for the flaviviruses, the envelope proteins drive particle assembly. Indeed, coexpression of both M and E has been shown to induce the production of VLPs, which are similar in size and appearance to authentic virions (Baudoux 1998, Bos 1996, Corse 2000, Vennema 1996). Although the coronavirus envelope can form itself, the nucleocapsid can stabilize the virion structure (de Haan 1998, Kuo 2002). Virus budding is most likely triggered by interactions between E and M proteins. The M protein plays a central role in coronavirus assembly. Indeed, in addition to its essential role in envelope formation, M protein interacts by its C\u2010terminus with the nucleocapsid (Escors 2001, Kuo 2002, Narayanan 2000). This interaction likely triggers the packaging of the nucleocapsid into the virion. In addition, due to its subcellular localization, the budding site of coronaviruses is likely dictated by the M protein. Interestingly, the M protein is able to interact with itself and with S, E, and HE proteins (Corse 2003, de Haan 1999, de Haan 2000, Lim 2001, Nguyen 1997). These interactions likely contribute to the formation of the envelope and help to incorporate the other envelope proteins into the coronavirus envelope.",

One is present on the internal side of the viral membrane, which is formed by the capsid protein, and the other one on the external side, which is formed by the glycoproteins. Both shells are organized according to a T = 4 symmetry. Budding of the alphaviruses occurs at the plasma membrane, and the envelope glycoproteins of alphaviruses have also been shown to play a major role in this process (Garoff et al., 2004). Lateral interactions within the \u201cskirt\u201d region of the glycoprotein layer have been shown to participate in assembly (Forsell et al., 2000). However, when expressed alone, the envelope glycoproteins do not induce budding (Suomalainen et al., 1992). Indeed, budding and particle formation require interaction of the E2 glycoprotein endodomain with the capsid protein (Forsell et al., 2000). Although the alphavirus glycoproteins play a major role in virion assembly, the real contribution of the preassembled nucleocapsid shell in the process remains unclear (Garoff et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The importance of matrix proteins for virus budding has been shown by the demonstration of budding of VLPs from cells expressing matrix proteins alone (Schmitt and Lamb, 2004). In many cases, additional viral components, when coexpressed with the viral matrix proteins, have been found to be incorporated into VLPs. In addition, in some cases, coexpression of matrix proteins along with additional viral components can substantially increase the efficiency with which particles bud. Interestingly, production of a rabies virus, which lacks the entire matrix gene, led to a 5 \u00d7 105\u2010fold reduction in viral particle production (Mebatsion et al., 1999), confirming the major role played by the matrix protein in the context of a viral system. The mechanism by which matrix proteins drive budding at the plasma membrane is not known. Matrix proteins interact with the inner leaflet of cellular membranes and the curving of the membrane may result from a self\u2010assembly process of matrix proteins or may be induced by interactions with cellular structures, such as the cytoskeleton (Takimoto and Portner, 2004). Experimental data on the matrix protein of several viruses suggest that matrix proteins are assembled as a layer beneath the plasma membrane of infected cells and induce other viral components to gather at this location, from which virus budding can then occur (Schmitt and Lamb, 2004). Determination of the atomic structure of some matrix proteins is beginning to shed some light on the potential implication of these proteins in virus assembly (Timmins et al., 2004). As discussed in section IV.A.2, the matrix protein of Ebola virus is composed of two related \u03b2\u2010sandwich domains, which are connected by a flexible linker (Dessen et al., 2000). Early work showed that this conformation is metastable and allows an easy transition into oligomeric ring\u2010like structures in vitro (Ruigrok 2000, Scianimanico 2000). The ring structures are either octamers or hexamers (Timmins et al., 2003). Interestingly, SDS\u2010resistant octamers have been shown to be present in Ebola VLPs and in virus particles (Panchal et al., 2003). The N\u2010terminal domain of Ebola matrix protein is involved in oligomerization, whereas the C\u2010terminal domain has been shown to mediate membrane association (Timmins et al., 2004). Interestingly, a single point mutation that abolishes RNA binding and octamer formation does not affect VLP formation, indicating that octameric matrix protein is dispensable for VLP formation (Hoenen et al., 2005). However, when the mutation was introduced into the Ebola virus genome, no virus was rescued, indicating that RNA binding and octamer formation are essential for the Ebola virus life cycle.",

            "text": "Specific interactions between viral glycoproteins and matrix proteins can help in concentrating matrix proteins at the budding site. When expressed alone, the matrix protein of influenza virus does not bind to detergent\u2010resistant membranes (Ali et al., 2000). However, in the presence of viral envelope glycoproteins, the matrix protein of influenza interacts with HA and NA localized in rafts, and the matrix protein associated with membranes becomes detergent resistant (Ali 2000, Zhang 2000b). Thus the envelope glycoproteins, which are targeted to rafts, can drag other viral components so as to promote assembly within rafts, a location where influenza virus has been shown to assemble and bud (Scheiffele et al., 1999). However, this is not the case for measles virus for which both the F glycoprotein and the matrix protein contain signals for independent targeting to rafts (Vincent et al., 2000). Although interactions between matrix proteins and cytoplasmic tails of viral envelope glycoproteins seem to play a role in the budding of many negative\u2010strand RNA viruses, incorporation of glycoproteins into viral particles can occur independently of specific signals as observed for glycoprotein G of VSV (Schnell et al., 1998). The nucleocapsid is an essential additional viral component that also needs to accumulate at the budding site to form infectious viral particles. Interactions between matrix proteins and viral nucleocapsids are well documented and are presumed to be critical for efficient incorporation of genomes into budding virions (Schmitt and Lamb, 2004).",

            "text": "In the Retroviridae family, the matrix protein is initially part of the Gag polyprotein (Morita and Sundquist, 2004). Expression of Gag is largely sufficient to induce virus assembly and budding at the plasma membrane. Gag is a complex polyprotein containing different functional domains. In HIV, Gag is organized into four distinct regions, which carry out different primary functions in the coordinated process of particle formation: the N\u2010myristylated MA domain targets Gag to the plasma membrane, CA makes important protein\u2013protein interactions that are required for particle assembly, NC captures the viral RNA genome and couples RNA binding to particle assembly, and p6 recruits cellular proteins that function in the final stages of virus release (Adamson and Jones, 2004). In addition to these domains, spacer peptides separate the CA and NC domains (SP1) and the NC and p6 domains (SP2) in Gag polyprotein. Although Gag is processed by the viral protease to produce infectious virions, extracellular particles are produced in the absence of this protease. This indicates that the Gag polyprotein can be considered as the element that drives virus budding. Assembly is therefore a result of ordered oligomerization in which neighboring regions on adjacent Gag monomers provide the necessary molecular contacts. Like the matrix proteins of negative\u2010strand RNA viruses, MA associates with membranes and is found beneath the inner layer of the virion membrane. However, unlike other matrix proteins, the MA domain does not play a major role in driving particle assembly. Indeed, deletion of the MA domain does not affect the ability of other Gag assembly domains to drive particle assembly (Adamson and Jones, 2004). The predominant domains involved in Gag assembly have been identified in the C\u2010terminal third of the CA domain and in its adjoining spacer peptide SP1. In addition, the NC domain has also been shown to promote Gag assembly after binding of the viral genome to the NC domain. In conclusion, correct particle assembly occurs via Gag multimerization and is driven by multiple cooperative interprotein contacts involving several Gag domains. Although multimerization of Gag may be initiated in the cytosol, binding to the plasma membrane facilitates the concentration of Gag in an oriented way, which further aids multimerization, assembly, and budding (Morikawa 2000, Nermut 2003, Ono 2000). A molecular reorganization of Gag takes place upon proteolytic maturation of the polyprotein. This maturation is considered to take place concomitant with, or shortly after, release of the immature particle and is mediated by the virion\u2010encoded protease. After cleavage between MA and CA proteins, the matrix protein MA remains associated with the membrane; however, the affinity of this interaction is considerably weaker than in the context of uncleaved Gag polyprotein (Hermida\u2010Matsumoto 1999, Zhou 1996). Importantly, MA protein needs to dissociate from the membrane during virus disassembly upon infection. As discussed in Section IV.A.1.a, the N\u2010terminal myristyl group of MA protein plays a role in regulating membrane binding and dissociation (Tang et al., 2004). Indeed, the myristyl group is sequestered in monomeric MA and exposed in the trimeric form of the protein. Although the high concentration of myristylated MA in mature virions is expected to favor protein self\u2010association and membrane binding, the equilibrium would shift toward the monomeric MA species in the diluting environment of the cell being infected, allowing MA to dissociate from the membrane (Tang et al., 2004) (Fig. 9). Although Env is not required for budding of the retroviruses, it is essential for the formation of infectious particles. Env can be concentrated at the site of virus budding through specific interactions between the cytoplasmic tail of the TM subunit and the MA protein of Gag (Pelchen\u2010Matthews et al., 2004). However, the fidelity of Env incorporation is not stringent.",

            "text": "The last stage of budding requires a final pinching off step to release the assembled virion from the cell. Recently, it has become apparent that some viruses use the endocytic pathway to coordinate their release from infected cells. These viruses have been shown to exploit the machinery that generates the internal membranes of multivesicular bodies (MVB) (Pelchen\u2010Matthews 2004, Pornillos 2002). It has been known for a while that a deletion of the C\u2010terminal region of HIV Gag (p6 protein) causes a defect in viral particle release (Gottlinger et al., 1991). Electron microscopic studies of such mutants show particles that fail to pinch off the plasma membrane. It has also been shown that a highly conserved PTAP sequence motif, termed late domain, is playing a crucial role in viral budding (Huang et al., 1995). Several classes of viral late domains have now been identified: P(T/S)AP, YXXL, LXXLF, and PPXY (Timmins et al., 2004). These motifs are present in the Gag proteins of retroviruses and in the matrix proteins of some negative\u2010strand RNA viruses. Importantly, these viral late domains function by recruiting cellular factors that are normally involved in intraluminal vesicle formation of MVB (Pelchen\u2010Matthews 2004, Pornillos 2002). Proteins destined for delivery to intraluminal vesicles are frequently found to be monoubiquitinated on their cytoplasmic domain. This allows them to be recognized by protein complexes called endosomal sorting complexes required for transport: ESCRT\u2010I, ESCRT\u2010II, and ESCRT\u2010III. In addition to recognizing ubiquitinated proteins, the ESCRT machinery is thought to drive the outward vesiculation and scission of the intraluminal vesicles, a process similar to virus budding. Interestingly, viral late domains function by recruiting the same factors that are involved in intraluminal vesicle formation (Fig. 11\n). It is now recognized that late domain interactions with cellular factors most likely recruit the ESCRT machinery to the site of budding where the components of this machinery are utilized by the viruses in a mechanistically analogous manner to their normal cellular function to mediate virus budding (Morita 2004, Pelchen\u2010Matthews 2004, Pornillos 2002).",

The nature of the interactions between viral proteins and cellular membranes is complex, and often not completely understood. While significant progress has been made at biochemical, structural, and ultrastructural levels of viruses and viral proteins, crucial aspects of virus\u2013host interactions remain to be elucidated. The concerted interactions of viral proteins, lipid membranes, and host factors result in a variety of conformational changes leading to the establishment of different protein associations. These distinct protein associations mediated and supported by membranes provide viruses with the ability to cross the plasma membrane for particle entry, modify different intracellular organelles for genome replication, and acquire envelope proteins for virion assembly. In each of these processes, specific cell membranes are targeted by distinct viral protein signals to create either a microenvironment or a compartment on which appropriate host factors will assist. Although, in general, the major steps of viral replication are known, the specific requirements for establishing interactions and functions through particular membranes are matters of active research. This not only will contribute to a better understanding of virus replication but will also advance the understanding of membrane\u2013protein interactions in the cell.",

Receptor binding may trigger endocytosis or direct entry at the plasma membrane. Four endocytic routes have been described for viruses. Many enveloped and nonenveloped viruses are internalized from the plasma membrane in clathrin\u2010coated vesicles. They are transported to early endosomes, and for some of them to late endosomes. At low endosomal pH, viral proteins undergo conformational changes that initiate the penetration of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm by fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane for enveloped viruses, or by endosomal lysis or formation of a pore\u2010like structure for nonenveloped viruses. Other viruses are internalized from the plasma membrane via caveolar endocytosis. They are delivered to caveosomes from which they are sorted to other intracellular destinations, such as the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for SV40, for penetration into the cytoplasm. Unlike early and late endosomes, caveosomes have a neutral content. Nonclathrin, noncaveola endocytic routes also occur, which appear to traffic viruses toward early and late endosomes or toward caveosome\u2010like structures. Most of these endocytic routes are dependent on dynamin function.",
