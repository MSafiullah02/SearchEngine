In young pups, or when the virus occurs with concurrent pathogens, diarrhoea may be severe with dehydration, loss of appetite and even death (Appel 1987). Infected dogs generally shed CCoV in their faeces for six to nine days after infection (Keenan and others 1976), although the virus has been detected in faeces up to six months after clinical signs have ceased (Pratelli and others 2002b, 2001a, Pratelli 2006). CCoV is highly contagious, and once the virus is established in a kennel, the spread of the infection is difficult to control. Crowding, unsanitary conditions, stress during training and other environmental conditions appear to favour the development of clinical disease (Evermann and others 1980, Yasoshima and others 1983, Pratelli and others 2001b, 1999b, Decaro and others 2004a). Disinfection of kennels and equipment with 3 per cent hypochlorite solution is effective in killing CCoV, but it does not prevent dog\u2010to\u2010dog transmission.",

The safety and immunogenicity of an experimental modified\u2010live CCoV vaccine administered intramuscularly or oronasally were subsequently shown (Pratelli and others 2004).

For this purpose, the modified\u2010live CCoV vaccine (Pratelli and others 2004) was further attenuated (60 passages) and tested for its ability to immunise dogs. Because CCoV is considered a poor immunogen, dogs were vaccinated twice by the oronasal route. Of interest was the significant immune response observed in the sera and in the faeces of all dogs after the second inoculation. After challenge at 14 dpsv, protection from CCoV infection was complete because no viral shedding was observed by either virus isolation or PCR tests. Protection against CCoV infections has generally been associated with the presence of specific antibodies on the mucosal surface. Therefore, mucosal IgA in the vaccinated dogs (Table 2) might be responsible for the protection observed (Ogra and others 1980, Saif 1999, 1996, Decaro and others 2004b).",

Because multiple infections are common in high\u2010density populations, such as in unvaccinated kennels, and that dogs may shed the virus for as long as six months after the clinical signs have ceased (Pratelli and others 2002b, 2001a), it seems that immunisation of dogs to produce a sterilising immunity would have beneficial epidemiological effects in controlling the spread of CCoV in high\u2010risk dog populations.",
