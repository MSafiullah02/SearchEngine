            "text": "It is commonly accepted that the breakup criteria of drops or bubbles in turbulence is governed by surface tension and inertia. However, also buoyancy can play an important role at breakup. In order to better understand this role, here we numerically study Rayleigh-Bnard convection for two immiscible fluid layers, in order to identify the effects of buoyancy on interface breakup. We explore the parameter space spanned by the Weber number 5 \u2264 W e \u2264 5000 (the ratio of inertia to surface tension) and the density ratio between the two fluids 0.001 \u2264 \u039b \u2264 1, at fixed Rayleigh number Ra = 10 8 and Prandtl number P r = 1. At low W e, the interface undulates due to plumes. When W e is larger than a critical value, the interface eventually breaks up. Depending on \u039b, two breakup types are observed: The first type occurs at small \u039b \u226a 1 (e.g. air-water systems) when local filament thicknesses exceed the Hinze length scale. The second, strikingly different, type occurs at large \u039b with roughly 0.5 < \u039b \u2264 1 (e.g. oil-water systems): The layers undergo a periodic overturning caused by buoyancy overwhelming surface tension. For both types the breakup criteria can be derived from force balance arguments and show good agreement with the numerical results.",

This physical phenomenon is very important for raindrops [4] , for ocean waves and the resulting spray [5] , and even for the transmission of virus-laden droplets during coughing or sneezing [6] . Once the physical mechanisms governing this important phenomenon are understood, one can deduce quantitative criteria for the breakup to occur. For drops or bubbles the breakup criteria can be deduced from the balance of inertial and surface tension forces, as developed in the Kolmogorov-Hinze (KH) theory [7, 8] . This theory well predicts the breakup criteria in experimental and numerical results in various flow systems, e.g., homogeneous isotropic turbulence [9, 10] , shear flows [11] , pipe flows [12] and ocean waves [1, 13] .",

As examples for turbulent flow where buoyancy is important and at the same time can easily be tuned, we take thermal convection, namely Rayleigh-Bnard (RB) convection [17] [18] [19] of two immiscible fluids. We numerically investigate the breakup mechanisms of the interface between the two immiscible fluids. The immiscible fluids are first arranged in two layers according to their densities and then heated from below and cooled from above. Previous studies of such two-layer RB convection in cylindrical container [20] , in sphericalshell geometry [21] , and in a rectangular domain [22] have focused on the flow structures in each layer and the coupling modes between the flows in the two layers, including viscous coupling and thermal coupling. However, these previous studies only considered the case for strong surface tension, where the interface between the layers does not break up. In this study we will for the first time explore the case with interface breakup, which happens when surface tension is sufficiently small.",

Except for the density \u03c1, all other properties of the two fluids are the same. The other dimensionless parameters are W e = \u03c1 > U 2 H/\u03c3, Ra = \u03b1gH 3 \u2206/(\u03bd\u03ba), P r = \u03bd/\u03ba, the Froude number F r = U 2 /(gH). Here \u03c3 is the surface tension coefficient, \u03b1 the thermal expansion coefficient, g the gravitational acceleration, \u2206 the temperature difference between the plates, \u03bd the kinematic viscosity, \u03ba the thermal diffusivity, H the domain height and U = \u221a \u03b1gH\u2206 the characteristic so called free-fall velocity. We fix Ra = 10 8 , P r = 1, F r = 1 and \u0393 = 2, and only vary W e from 5 to 5000 and \u039b from 0.001 (e.g. air-water system) to 1 (e.g. oil-water system).",

From the snapshot with the advecting drops in Fig. 1(a) , we observe the large scale circulation, which is well known from single phase convection [37] [38] [39] . Fig. 1 (b) displays the distribution of the drop size D, which follows the scaling law (D/H) \u221210/3 [40, 41] valid for large drops. This scaling is consistent with experimental and other numerical results where the breakup of waves [1, 13] or of a big drop [10] was studied. Moreover, the maximal diameter of drops D max (see Fig. 1c ) well agrees with the KH scaling law D max /H \u223c W e \u22123/5 . Similar to the other turbulent flows [1, 12] , the KH theory thus still works in RB convection with drops. At the same time the results show that the code and our approach give consistent results.",

The temperature profile is similar to that obtained from two-layer RB convection experiments [14] . As W e increases (Fig. 2b) , the interface undulates due to the plumes. Each crest and trough on the interface is caused by a rising, or respectively settling plume in the heavier fluid >. In this situation, inertia is resisted by gravity together with surface tension.

The reason is that D Hinze is smaller in fluid > than in fluid < as \u03c1 > > \u03c1 < . We now come to the large \u039b \u2248 1 case: Since fluid > carries hotter fluid than fluid <, due to thermal expansion it can become lighter than fluid <, inverting the original density contrast at equal temperature. In this situation, buoyancy drives fluid > upwards and fluid < downwards. This leads to wave crests and troughs, as shown in Fig. 3 . If W e is low (Fig. 3a) , the surface tension can maintain the interface stable, though it is wobbling. However, if W e increases (Fig. 3b) , the wobbling wave on the interface can amplify more and more until it finally touches the upper and/or lower plate and breaks up. we call this type of interface breakup the \"second type of breakup\".",

A periodic overturning is observed both in the fluid dynamics and in the heat transfer (see Fig. 3 ): After interface breakup at t 1 , fluid > initially at the bottom gradually rises above fluid < and finally contacts the upper cold plate. The increased wetted area of the hotter fluid on the upper cold plate causes a strong enhancement of the Nusselt number N u, in the shown case 5 times of N u without breakup, as shown in Fig. 3(d) . Then, fluid > on the top gets cooler and thus heavier, while fluid < at the bottom warmer and thus lighter. Once again, the breakup occurs after t 3 and the fluids swap their positions (see Fig. 3c ). Since fluid < is lighter than fluid > at the same temperature, it is easier to rise and touch the cold plate. Thus, with fluid < as the bottom layer, the temperature of the bottom layer during the breakup is lower than that when fluid > is the bottom layer. This is also reflected in the heat transfer. The peak of N u after t 3 is smaller, only 3 times of N u without breakup, and the preparation time for breakup from t 2 to t 3 is shorter than that from t 4 to t 5 .",

Our findings clearly demonstrate that interface breakup in multilayer thermally driven turbulence cannot be solely described by the KH theory, which is only applicable when the lower layer is much denser than the upper layer or when thermal expansion effects do not play a role. Interestingly, when the lower layer is less dense than the upper layer, the system is unstably stratified, leading to the new breakup type described in this paper where buoyancy and surface tension are the dominant forces. It would be interesting to test our predictions of Eqs. (2) and (5) for the transitions between the different regimes in a larger range of the control parameters Ra, P r, and F r, which were kept fixed here. More generally, our findings emphasize the role of buoyancy in interfacial breakup. Clearly, buoyancy will also play a prominent role in the interfacial breakup in other turbulent flows, such as Bnard-Marangoni convection, and horizontal and vertical convection.",
