A nanomaterial comprises of nanoparticles (NPs) that are less than 100 nm at least in one dimension. The term \u201cnanotechnology\u201d deals with small-sized materials when the size is down to subnanometer or several hundred nanometers [3]. The controlled synthesis and tuning properties of nanomaterials require knowledge of different disciplines such as physics, chemistry, electronics, computer science, biology, engineering, agriculture, etc. that may lead to the emergence of novel and multifunctional nanotechnologies. In this context, the exciting properties of nanomaterials have attracted the world scientific community toward their application in various sectors such as health, food, security, transport, and information technology, etc. The intelligent use of nanomaterials is predicted to enhance the performance of biomolecular electronic devices with high sensitivities and detection limits.",

Early diagnostics plays an important role to detect a disease (prevention) or the outcome of a disease (prognosis). A number of biodevices have been fabricated for studies of blood gas, glucose/lactate/cholesterol, nucleic acid sequence analysis, proteins/peptides, combinatorial synthesis, toxicity monitoring, immunoassays, environment, defense, and forensic analysis. A biosensor for blood glucose monitoring has been successfully commercialized (Fig. 1.1.1\n). Efforts are being made to enhance the resolution, accuracy, and miniaturization of biosensors for detection of biomolecules along with microfluidics and sample preprocessing [4]. Because of their portability, the short time to obtain results, biosensors have been predicted to fulfill a number of unmet needs in the diagnostics industry. Microfluidic biosensing devices offer important opportunities for research, especially for clinical diagnosis, due to their numerous advantages.

The quantum well consists of a greater density of electronic states locate the edges of the conduction and valence bands than in bulk materials.

During the self-assembly process, the basic unit of a larger structure is composed of nanostructured materials. This method has been used for the formation of quantum dots during the epitaxial growth and the formation of NPs from colloidal dispersion. This approach yields lesser defects and a more homogeneous chemical composition.2.\nTop\u2013down approach: In this method, the large (macroscopic) structure can be externally controlled during processing of the desired nanostructures. Etching through the mask, ball milling, and application of severe plastic deformation are examples of this approach.

Besides this, attrition and pyrolysis have been used. In particular to pyrolysis, a vaporous liquid or gas precursor is forced by an orifice at high pressure and is burnt. Pyrolysis often results in aggregates and agglomerates rather than single primary particles. Interestingly, the chemical route for the synthesis of NPs has been developed which includes the sol\u2013gel technique. These materials possess many attractive properties ascribed to the high volume fraction of interfacial structures. The studies have been extended to form nanocomposites with synergistic properties. Additionally, nanostructured powders such as titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, etc. were obtained by using a flame pyrolysis process have led to commercial products. NPs, through colloidal chemistry in liquid environments, involve numerous processes in nature (e.g., the fabrication of water glass). Colloidal solution is representative of NPs stabilized in solution so as to stop aggregation. Usually, the stabilization happens due to absorption of electric charges on the surface, leading to repulsion of the NPs providing a critical distance. The use of this chemical colloidal route shows the ways pertaining to developments in research of nanomaterials synthesis. NPs and nanocomposites synthesized by chemical precipitation or in situ development in a given matrix during the sol\u2013gel process have been explored for more than a decade. This is an interesting route for the production of nanocomposites by chemical means. The sol\u2013gel technique is exploited for the synthesis of metal oxides starting from a chemical solution (or sol), which proceeds as the precursor to make network (or gel) with discrete particles or network polymers. In the sol\u2013gel process, metal alkoxides and chlorides are typical precursors, wherein hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions can occur in an elastic solid network or a colloidal suspension. To facilitate a sufficient amount of dispersion of the particles, the surface should be compatible to the matrix, and surface functionalization of the NPs is crucial via suitable processing routes. The size range of NPs are found to be as nanometers (10\u22129\n m) to micrometers (10\u22126\n m).",

Using silicon-processing technology, the commercialization of integrated circuits in the microelectronics industry began in 1965. The progress in reducing the size of circuits has increased over time. In 1965, prediction of \u201cMoore Law\u201d led to rapid developments of miniaturized integrated circuits via reduction of transistor dimensions, increased transistor counts, and enhanced operating frequencies. In 2000, field-effect transistor (FET) was first scaled below 100 nm, inaugurating the era of silicon nanoelectronics. In various companies including Intel, IBM, iMac G5, etc. the nanostructured materials have been considered for manufacture of chips. In this context, CNTs, graphene, fullerene, etc. and quantum dots can be explored for the electronics industries. For example, Nantero has developed a high-density nonvolatile random access memory chip known as the NRAM (nanotube-based/nonvolatile random access memory) chip using CNTs that may act as active memory elements. IBM developed CNTs-based transistors in 2006. Other nanomaterials such as ferroelectric oxides barium titanate (BaTiO3), lead zirconate titanate [Pb(Zr,Ti)O3], and barium-strontium titanate [(Ba,Sr)-TiO3] are being researched for development of transducers, actuators, and high-k dielectrics.

            "text": "This category of biosensors involves an electrochemical reaction on a transducer surface between bio-receptors or biomarkers and detectable analytes and produce an electrochemical signal. The electrochemical biosensors provide label-free detection with high signal-to-volume ratio, and they can detect biomolecules without damaging the system. In this configuration, bioreceptor molecules are either coated onto or covalently bonded to a transducer surface (Fig. 1.2.9A\n). The bioreceptor molecules react specifically with target biomolecules that to be detected, generated a corresponding electrical signal in terms of voltage, current, impedance, capacitance, etc. Based on the operating principle, electrochemical biosensors can be employed to work as potentiometric, capacitive, amperometric, and impedimetric transducers, convert the biological/chemical into a measurable signal. Electrochemical biosensors can be operated using an electrochemical cell. The types of electrochemical biosensors are given below:1.\nAmperometric: Amperometric biosensors measure either the current or potential resulting from a chemical reaction of electroactive materials on transducer surface while a constant potential or current, respectively, is applied. The change in current is related to the concentration of the target species. The working electrode (WE) of the amperometric biosensor is usually a noble metal (gold, titanium, nickel, etc.), indium tin oxide (ITO), or carbon covered by the bioreceptor elements. In an amperometric biosensor, on application of potential, the current (typically nA to mA range) due to catalytic conversion or the absorption of proteins that occurs at the electrode surface is measured.2.\nPotentiometric: Potentiometric biosensors can detect potential from a chemical reaction of electroactive materials when constant current is applied. Potentiometric biosensors can measure species such as pH, H+, NH4\n+, and other ions, as well as biomolecules including glucose, urea, penicillin, etc. Potentiometric biosensors are based on ion-sensitive FETs (is-FETs), graphene-FET, or bioFET (Fig. 1.2.9B and C). In case of an is-FET, the output signal can be measured from ions (H+, pH etc.) accumulated at the ion-selective membrane interface. Carbon material such as graphene, CNT, etc. can be used to immobilize biomolecules for drain potential/current in FET devices. Mao et al. have grown graphene vertically for the development of FET potentiometric biosensors [43].3.\nImpedimetric and Capacitive: These techniques are label-free techniques and can be utilized for quantification of biomolecular interactions such as enzymatic, DNA hybridization, antigen\u2013antibody and protein\u2013protein interactions. A target biomolecule, when it reacts with a specific bioreceptor on sensor surface, the changes in the dielectric constant or resistance can result exclusively due to the presence of the target molecules. Thus, there is no label required for impedance sensing, which is beneficial for protein detection for the construction of third-generation biosensors. The electrical impedance is the measure of the resistance that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied. It can be defined as the ratio of the voltage to the current in a given frequency domain. Impedance biosensors measure the electrical impedance generated on electrode/electrolyte interface in the alternating current (AC) steady-state under constant direct current (DC) bias conditions. In an electrochemical cell, various phenomena such as kinetics of antigen\u2013antibody interactions, redox reactions, and other molecular interactions at the electrode surface can be considered to impede the flow of electrons in a typical AC circuit for impedance analysis. Usually, impedance is demonstrated as a complex number, where the ohmic and capacitive reactance have the real and imaginary components, respectively. To represent electrochemical impedance data are the Nyquist and Bode plots are widely used. In a typical Nyquist plot, the imaginary component (Z\u2033, out of phase) is plotted versus the real component (Z\u2032, in phase) by varying frequencies. But in a Bode plot, the logarithm of the absolute impedance, |Z|, and the phase shift (\u03c6) of the impedance are displayed versus the logarithm of the applied frequency. Capacitive biosensors utilize the change in dielectric properties at the electrolyte\u2013electrode interfaces due to the interaction of biomolecules. An ideal capacitor has the capacity to store charge, and thus the electric capacitance can be expressed as\n(1.1.5)C=\u03b5o\u03b5Adwhere A is the area, d is the separation between the plates, \u03b5o is the dielectric constant, and \u03b5 is the relative static permittivity. Lee et al. have developed an impedance-based electrochemical biosensor using aptamer-functionalized pyrolyzed carbon electrode for detection of protein molecules [44]. Wang et al. fabricated a TiO2 nanowire bundle microelectrode-based impedimetric biosensor for sensitive detection of Listeria monocytogenes\n[45].4.\nConductimetric: It can be used to quantify the change in the electrical conductivity of a cell solution. When electrochemical reactions produce electrons/ions, the conductivity of the solution is changed. The measurement of conductance has a relatively low sensitivity. With a sinusoidal applied, the generated electric field can reduce the undesirable effects including Faradaic process, concentration polarization, and double-layer charging.\n",

A typical Nyquist plot contains a semicircle region followed by a straight line lying on the real axis. The linear part (\u03a8 = \u03c0/4), found in the low frequency range, indicates a mass-transfer limited process, whereas the semicircle portion in the high-frequency range, indicates a charge-transfer limited process (Fig. 1.4.2B). Both Nyquist and Bode plots can be used to measure the relative change in surface-charge resistance. Interfacial R\nct and C\ndl in the Nyquist plot are obtained from real (Z\u2032) and imaginary (\u2212Z\u2033) impedance as a function of frequency using the following Eq.

In optical biosensors, the transduction process induces the change in the absorption, transmission, reflection, refraction, phase, amplitude, frequency, or polarization of light in response to the physical/chemical change created by the biorecognition events. The optical biosensors can also be fabricated using SPR, fluorescence, biochemi/luminescence, Raman scattering, and refractive index (RI). A light source (light-emitting diode, laser, etc.), an optical transmission media (waveguide, fiber, etc.), a bioreceptor (enzymes, antibodies, or microbes), and an optical detection system are the main components of an optical biosensor.

Fluorescence is a three-stage process that can occur in particular molecules such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons or heterocycles known as fluorophores or fluorescent dyes. A fluorophore molecule can be predicted to respond to a specific stimulus or to confine within a specific region of a biomolecule.

In the second stage, the excited state occurs for a finite time of \u223c1\u201310 ns. Within this time, the fluorophore experiences conformational changes and can have multiple interactions at molecular levels. The energy of S1 can partially be dissipated, providing a relaxed singlet excited state (S2) where fluorescence emission originates. However, all molecules are not initially excited by absorption back to S0 (ground state) by fluorescence emission. And collisional quenching, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) may occur to depopulate S2. In the third stage, after emission with a photon energy of h\u03bd\nem, the fluorophore returns to S0. A longer wavelength and lower energy can be achieved than the excitation photon h\u03bd\nem due to energy dissipation during the excited-state lifetime. The difference of excitation and emission energy such as h\u03bd\nex\n \u2212 \nh\u03bd\nem is known as Stokes shift.

Above a certain angle of the incidence, all of the light would be reflected with diminishing refracted light. This phenomenon is known as total internal reflection (TIR), and this angle is called the resonance angle. Noble metals such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), etc. can be used to create surface plasmons.

Fig. 1.5.1\ndemonstrates a propagating plasmon (Fig. 1.5.1A) and a localized surface plasmon (Fig. 1.5.1B). In surface polaritons, plasmons propagate in the x-axis and y-axis directions within a distance of 10\u2013100 \u03bcm along the metal\u2013dielectric interface, and decay evanescently in the z-axis direction with 1/e decay lengths of 200 nm. The interaction of electromagnetic waves at the metal surface and a molecular surface can lead to shift in resonance condition that can be observed in three different modes, namely: resonance angle, wavelength shift, and imaging. The reflectivity of light obtained from the metal surface is measured as a function of the incidence angle (at constant wavelength) or wavelength (at constant incidence angle) in the first two modes. However, with constant wavelength and incident angle, mapping the reflectivity of the surface can be observed as a function of position in case of imaging. In case of LSPR, the light can interact directly with particles much smaller compared to the incident wavelength (Fig. 1.5.1B) indicating that the plasmon oscillates locally around the NP with a known frequency of LSPR. In SPR and LSPR, Ag and Au NPs are commonly used due to their unique optical properties and their absorption band in the visible region. Silver NPs have a narrower resonance spectra and thus provide a higher signal-to-noise ratio; however, Ag NPs exhibit a higher chemical reactivity.",

When TIR occurs, the light rays are conducted through the core of the fiber with an insignificant loss of light to the surrounding. The formation of an optical fiber (OP) by a core with a RI n\n1 and a cladding with a RI n\n2 is shown in Fig. 1.5.4\n. To transmit light by TIR, the RI of the core (n\n1) and cladding (n\n2) should be n\n1\n > \nn\n2. When light strikes the boundary interface having different RI and the angle of incidence is larger than the critical angle as defined by Snell's law (\u03b8\nc\n = sin\u22121[n\n2/n\n1]), the light will be totally reflected and guided through the fiber. The intensity of light is not zero at the interface when the incident light is totally reflected (Fig. 1.5.4A). A small part of light perforates the reflecting medium. The intensity decreases exponentially with distance from the interface and extends into the medium of lower RI. The penetration depth (d\np) is the distance needed for the electric field amplitude to fall to 1/e (0.37) at the interface, and it is a function of the wavelength and incidence angle of light (Fig. 1.5.4B). The evanescent wave interacts with molecules within the dp and produces a net flow of energy across the reflecting surface. This transfer of energy is known as attenuation in reflectance and can be utilized for the development of biosensors (attenuated total reflection biosensors). When an evanescent wave excites a fluorophore molecule, the emission of fluorescence can be directed back into the OP and transported to the detector. This principle is known as TIR of fluorescence, and this has been widely used for imaging biomolecules. Several optical phenomena such as fluorescence, absorption, evanescent wave, and SPR can be exploited for optical biosensing.",

An example of such a sensor is quartz crystal micro- or nanobalance. An alternating potential can produce a standing wave in the crystal at a resonance frequency. This resonance frequency depends on the elasticity of the crystal and if the crystal is coated with a biomarker, the binding of a target analyte to that biomarker will generate a change in the resonance frequency.

Two popular enzymes such as urease and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) can be employed for urea level detection. The enzymatic reaction for urea detection is shown in Fig. 1.5.7\n.

However, some of the disadvantages include depuration from bound label, washing and separation steps, increased complexity of the assay, etc. The nonspecific binding of an antibody with foreign molecules other than the target analytes is a major issue in immunosensors development. One of the major problems that has delayed the commercialization is the inability of integration and supporting accessories on a single format.",

Currently, DNA biosensor technologies are of much interest because of their rapid and low-cost recognition of specific DNA sequences. These technologies commonly depend on the immobilization of a single-strand oligonucleotide probe onto transducer surfaces which can be optical, electrochemical, or mass-sensitive. The probe DNA (pDNA) is specific to recognize the complementary DNA (called duplex) target sequence via hybridization, resulting in a change in the measurable signal. Specific binding of the surface-confined ssDNA probe and its complementary DNA strand are translated into corresponding readout signals. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is known to be more specific than DNA for detection of biomolecular recognition. Structurally, PNA and DNA are almost similar, but the entire negatively charged sugar\u2013phosphate backbone of DNA is exchanged with a neutral (peptide-like) backbone having repeated N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine units associated with amide bonds. The adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine are the four natural bases found in DNA molecules. The amperometric, potentiometric, and impedimetric are the electrochemical techniques that have been employed for development of genosensors, whereas SPR, absorption, etc. are optical techniques for genosensors. CNTs, graphene, metal NPs, and nanocomposites and conducting polymers are the nanomaterials that are utilized for development of genosensors due to their larger surface area and biocompatibility with DNA molecules. Fig. 1.6.0\nshows the immobilization pDNA and hybridization of target DNA based on conducting polymer as an electrochemical transducer [61].",
