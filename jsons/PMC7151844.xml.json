Osteonecrosis primarily occurs in the third to fifth decade of life.9 As a result of this age distribution, long-term morbidity can be significant because most hip replacements have a finite period of viability.",

There are several forms of corticosteroids of differing potency and half-life, and dosages and duration of use vary between studies, so any conclusions about a \u201csafe\u201d dose of corticosteroids are wrought with potential confounding variables and errors. In one study of 20 patients diagnosed with stage 1 osteonecrosis by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the interval between the use of steroids and diagnosis ranged from 1 to 16 months.11 The cumulative dose of steroids in this study ranged from 1800 to 15,505 mg (mean, 5928 mg) of prednisolone or the equivalent. In other studies cumulative doses of steroids associated with osteonecrosis ranged from 48012 to 432013 mg of dexamethasone dose equivalence. A recent paper by Powell and colleagues14 attempted to collectively analyze the available literature to derive maximum safe levels for duration, maximum daily dose, and average daily dose of corticosteroids. The study confirmed that many other confounding variables affect the development of osteonecrosis, making analysis of dose-response risk for an isolated association difficult. Nonetheless, corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis is dependent on dosage and the risk factor is higher with the long-acting steroids and with parenteral usage.",

The evidence for an association between osteonecrosis and intramuscular or intra-articular corticosteroids is limited to case reports.17 Parenteral use poses a higher risk because of rapid absorption and longer half-life of the drugs used.",

The medial femoral circumflex artery and its branches supply most of the blood to the head and neck of the femur. The lateral femoral artery winds anterolaterally, and the medial femoral artery winds posteromedially around the neck of the femur, ultimately anastomosing with each other at the superolateral aspect of the femoral head. The lateral femoral circumflex artery and the medial femoral circumflex artery further anastomose with the superior and inferior gluteal branches of the internal iliac artery, providing collateral circulation between the femoral artery and the internal iliac artery. Small vessels known as retinacular arteries, ascending cervical branches of the extracapsular ring, form an intra-articular ring at the level of the cartilage. Eiphyseal arterial branches arise from this ring and penetrate the head and neck of the femur including the epiphyses. The artery of the ligament of the head of the femur is a branch of the obturator artery and may be the sole supplier of blood to the proximal fragment of the head.",

Diseases such as osteopetrosis and osteoporosis are a result of a dysfunction in the balance between bone deposition and bone resorption. The factors that regulate this homeostasis include cells of the bone matrix, immune cells, signaling molecules, cytokines and chemokines, and vitamins. Some of these regulatory factors may be present on both bone cells and immune cells, often serving different functions, thereby providing a link between the immune system and bone. Osteonecrosis, in fact, may be linked to such an imbalance in bone homeostasis. Immune factors may affect surrounding soft tissue as well, contributing to the development of osteonecrosis.

Kenzora was the first to introduce the concept of cumulative stress.117 Corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis seems to occur with greater frequency in patients who have significant underlying illness such as systemic lupus erythematosus118 or transplantation and less frequently or never in patients who are not chronically ill but are on steroids for an acute event such as head injury. Recent observations that corticosteroids induce osteonecrosis in SARS patients further support the notion that more than one insult to the bone or surrounding tissue may be necessary to precipitate osteonecrosis. For each of the known associations of osteonecrosis, different mechanisms may predominate such as lipid anomalies and apoptosis of osteoblasts in steroid-induced osteonecrosis, as well as elevated intraosseous pressures and coagulation abnormalities in dysbaric osteonecrosis, but additional factors may be necessary to precipitate osteonecrosis. The accumulated cell stress theory suggests that when the damaging effects of multiple events are added together, the involved bone is unable to recover from the chronic stress and osteonecrosis ensues.",

Certainly, single nucleotide polymorphisms have been noted in a number of genes that may be associated with osteonecrosis. It has been argued that endothelial nitric oxide synthase is an important player in the development of osteonecrosis. Nitric oxide may have beneficial effects on three systems involved in osteonecrosis, namely skeletal, vascular, and thrombotic. Each of these may be targets for proposed mechanisms of pathogenesis of osteonecrosis. A comparative analysis of the 26-base pair repeat polymorphism in intron 4 and the Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 of the eNOS gene in patients with idiopathic, steroid-induced, alcohol-induced, and normal control subjects was performed.119 The frequency of the homozygous 4a allele was found to be higher in patients with idiopathic osteonecrosis compared with control subjects. The frequency of the 4a/b allele was found to be higher in all types of osteonecrosis when compared with control subjects. The 4a allele is known to be associated with reduced synthesis of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, suggesting that nitric oxide may play a protective role against the development of osteonecrosis.",

This appearance on radiographs is the result of structural collapse of a necrotic segment of subchondral trabecular bone. At this stage, the disease is already irreversible. Later, radiographs will begin to show sclerotic changes (Figure 103-4\n). The appearance of radiographic \u201cdensity\u201d is secondary to compression of bone trabeculae after microfracture of the nonviable bone, calcification of detritic marrow, and repair of the necrotic area by deposition of new bone, the so-called creeping substitution. Flattening of the articular surface of bone is the sign of further bone collapse (Figure 103-5\n). To show best the radiographic appearance of osteonecrosis in the femoral head and better visualize the extent of the necrotic lesion, anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral films of the hip should be obtained.",

The first is estimating head involvement. This method was first proposed by Steinberg and colleagues134 in 1984, and it is defined by the appearance of abnormal signals on T1-weighted images. The degree of head involvement was classified into three categories: less than 15%, 15% to 30%, and greater than 30%. The second method used to evaluate extent is the index of necrotic extent, which is determined by measuring the angle created by the extent of subchondral involvement. Lesion size was estimated using a \u201cnecrotic arc angle,\u201d defined by the angle of the arc of the necrotic segment from the center of the femoral head. Two angles are obtained: \u201cA,\u201d representing the necrotic arc seen on midcoronal images, and \u201cB,\u201d representing the necrotic arc angle seen on midsagittal images. The index is a compilation of these two angles. The third method is a variation of the second, in which the angle is identified not on midcoronal or midsagittal images but on the image that shows the maximum lesion size in the sagittal and coronal planes. It is thought that this method would correct for the underestimation that may be inherent in the second method.",

Compared with cemented total hip replacements done for other conditions, osteonecrosis had a greater risk for loosening of acetabular and femoral components. A survivorship analysis of cemented total hip replacements in renal transplant patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head showed that there was excellent survival after 10 years (98.8%). After 20 years, the survival rate decreased to 63.8%.",

Conservative medical treatment is effective only in the early stages for symptomatic relief. Nonsurgical management does not seem to alter the natural course of the disease. Electrical stimulation has been used in the treatment of osteonecrosis, in conjunction with core decompression. Electrical stimulation enhances osteogenesis and neovascularization. It also alters the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast activity, resulting in increased bone deposition and decreased bone resorption. Delivery of electrical stimulation can be done by direct current (DC), pulsed electromagnetic field, and capacitance coupling. The success of electrical stimulation in the treatment of osteonecrosis has been rather mediocre. Eleven hips in eight patients with Ficat stage 2 osteonecrosis who underwent core decompression and placement of an electric stimulating coil within the core in the anterosuperior segment of the femoral head were studied. Of these, five hips required reoperation and six hips had progressive deterioration 13 months after initial placement of the coil. In addition, there was little histologic evidence that the coil did indeed generate new bone deposition around itself.",

Shock wave therapy produced better results than the nonvascularized bone grafting procedure, with comparatively less progression of disease. In 35 patients with 47 osteonecrotic hips, the use of shock wave therapy led to improvements in serum nitric oxide levels, angiogenic factors such as VEGF, and osteogenic factors such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and osteocalcin. Levels of inflammatory markers were reduced.

Many patients therefore present with advanced disease. Although spontaneous resolution of femoral head osteonecrosis can occur, it is rare and occurs only when lesion size is small. A study of the prognosis of osteonecrosis of the femoral head as a function of symptoms (pain) and radiographic findings showed that in patients who were asymptomatic and had normal radiographs, progression of the disease was slow, with only 1 of 23 hips progressing to pain and radiographic changes after 5 years. If radiographic changes are already present, disease progresses to pain in 14 of 19 patients after 5 years. In a study of stage 1 osteonecrotic lesions of the hip diagnosed with MRI, 40 patients were followed for an average of 11 years. All patients had stage 1 lesions on the contralateral hip. Overall, 35 of the 40 stage 1 hips became symptomatic and 29 hips showed collapse. The mean interval between diagnosis and collapse was 92 months, whereas the mean interval between symptoms and diagnosis was 80 months.

Why is it that corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis is more common in patients with certain underlying diseases and not in others? Is there a genetic basis for osteonecrosis? Common pathogenic mechanisms known to be involved in osteonecrosis include osteoblast/osteoclast survival and apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and coagulation abnormalities. However, it is still unclear how these mechanisms inter-relate with each other. In order to better appreciate the risk factors involved in osteonecrosis, a more complete understanding of the pathogenesis is necessary.
