Rising levels of antimicrobial-resistant infections may devastate our health system, costing many lives and using valuable resources [3, 4]. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are commonly seen in primary care consultations, with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) accounting for the largest source of inappropriate antibiotic use [5, 6]. This is because most URTIs are viral and self-limiting, and the administration of antibiotics is not clinically effective at shortening duration or symptom severity [7]. Similarly, among lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), acute bronchitis is commonly viral, but up to 80% of acute bronchitis patients still receive antibiotics [8]. Bacterial respiratory infections in primary care include acute otitis media, acute sinusitis and group A streptococcal pharyngitis and pneumonia, where narrow-spectrum antibiotics should be recommended as the first choice according to US [9] and UK guidelines [10]. However, broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as macrolides and fluoroquinolones, are often given which are more likely to generate resistance [11\u201313].",

This is particularly challenging in rural areas, as rural health workers have less education/training and may inappropriately prescribe more frequently [14]. A cross-sectional study in 10 provinces in Western China showed that antibiotics accounted for over half of the total prescriptions issued, and mostly for ARIs [15]. China has issued policies to regulate the use of antibiotics over the past 10 years. In 2012, the Chinese MoH issued a regulation for antibiotic prescriptions, limiting them to less than 60% of all prescriptions for inpatients and 20% for outpatients [16]. However, no operational details have been given. The policy has not been proven effective at improving appropriate antibiotic prescribing [17]. Additionally, the policy only focussed on large hospitals and neglected primary care facilities [18, 19].",

However, most intervention trials have been done in high-income countries [23, 24]. We previously developed an intervention to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for childhood (2\u201314 years old) upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in rural, public, primary care facilities known as township hospitals. The intervention included education for doctors and caregivers, as well as antibiotic prescribing peer-review meetings for doctors. We evaluated the intervention in a cluster-randomised controlled trial (cRCT) in Guangxi province, China, and it successfully reduced the frequency of antibiotic prescribing for childhood URTIs by 29 percentage points (95% CI \u2212 42 to \u2212 16) [25]. The interventions also demonstrated long-term benefits 12 months after trial completion [26].",

Assuming feasibility and acceptability, we will then use a cRCT to evaluate the intervention\u2019s effectiveness at reducing inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for RTIs (and improving other outcomes) in outpatients of any age within public primary care facilities, in comparison to usual care (which means existing relevant standard processes only, as our previously developed intervention has only been implemented in the previous study sites).",

Only medicines on the Essential Medicines List, issued by the national and provincial governments, can be prescribed in township hospitals and village clinics. These medicines are purchased through an open bidding platform run by the Provincial Government. Village clinics have access to a much lower variety of medicines compared to township hospitals. Formally, village doctors are not allowed to prescribe antibiotics based on their practice regulations. However, in our previous work in Guangxi we found that some village doctors did actually prescribe antibiotics for common colds, and that villagers often visited village clinics for convenience but frequently got the wrong advice, which is likely to drive demand for antibiotics when they seek care for themselves or their children in township hospitals [30]. For these reasons, village doctors need to be targeted by the invention as well.",

Based on our previous trial [25] we assume that the intra-cluster correlation coefficient will be 0.14 in the intervention arm and 0.09 in the control arm here, and based on our exploratory work we assume that we will be able to collect at least 500 eligible prescriptions per township hospital during the trial period, which we assume as our fixed cluster size. Based on these assumptions we estimated that we will require 17 clusters per arm to detect a 15-percentage-point or greater absolute reduction in the APR with 80% power using a two-sided hypothesis test with an alpha of 0.05 [37]. Because our previous trial data indicated potentially important county-level differences in baseline and during-trial-period APR levels and in the magnitude of the treatment effect, we also plan to stratify our randomisation by county. Therefore, this sample size also accounted for an unequal allocation ratio within strata, and, specifically given the number of clusters available in each county, it accounted for a within-county intervention-to-control allocation ratio of 8:9, which we chose in favour of the control arm for logistical purposes.",

We will repeat this process for the continuous outcome but using a multiple linear regression model to do the initial covariate adjustment. By estimating covariate-adjusted treatment-effect estimates we will reduce the risk of bias in our results due to imbalances in the cluster-randomisation, and we will increase the precision of the estimates. By ultimately estimating treatment effectiveness using a t test, for our cluster-level proportion outcomes we will estimate covariate-adjusted risk differences (i.e. absolute differences in cluster-level outcome proportions), as recommended by CONSORT, and for our cluster-level continuous outcome we will estimate treatment effectiveness as a covariate-adjusted mean difference. We will base our inferences about the effectiveness of the treatment on the outcomes by interpreting the 95% confidence intervals around our outcomes\u2019 treatment-effect estimates along with the associated two-sided t-statistic based p values. We will adjust all confidence intervals and p values for our secondary outcomes for \u2018multiple comparisons\u2019 using the Holm method [43, 44].",
