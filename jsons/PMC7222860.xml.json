Their paper described four domains of surge capacity\u2014staff, supplies, space, and system\u2014and their subcomponents (Table 1). For our purposes, we kept the primary metrics but considered the subcomponents in greater depth using information from the AHA database. The four domains are defined as follows: (1) Staff refers to personnel such as nurses, physicians, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, and technicians as well as non-medical personnel who are necessary for the efficient functioning of a health care facility or entity, including clerical support personnel, security specialists, and physical plant specialists. (2) Supplies include durable equipment, such as cardiac monitors, defibrillators, intravenous (IV) pumps, ventilators, blood glucose monitors, and laboratory equipment. Supplies also include consumable materials such as medications, oxygen, sterile dressings, intravenous fluids, IV catheters, syringes, sutures, and personal protective equipment. (3) Space includes total beds, staffed beds (beds available for which staff is able to attend to), available spaces and other opportunities to house patients, and the percentage of beds occupied. (4) Systems for health care organizations include integrated policies and procedures that operationally and financially link multiple hospitals and individual departments within a health care setting. Additionally, systems can refer to policies and procedures that link a given health care facility with other health care entities such as EMS, home health care, long-term care, and physicians\u2019 offices.",

Inpatient variables were selected because they are associated primarily with a hospital\u2019s surge readiness to mass casualty events.

After review, each of the applicable variables in the AHA database was classified within one of the four \u201ccategories\u201d in the \u201cThe Science of Surge\u201d. Generally, the \u2018staff\u2019 category represented numbers, skill set and expertise of staff. Specifically, the \u2018staff category\u2019 included AHA survey variables related to medical personnel, technicians, therapists, and non-medical personnel necessary for the efficient functioning of a health care facility or entity, including case management. Relating the AHA data set to Kelen and McCarthy\u2019s \u2018supplies\u2019 variables correlated with: supplies directly purchased through a distributor, the number of computed-tomography (CT) scanners and total costs attributed to equipment. \u2018Space\u2019 subcomponents included hospital bed quality, size and location. This corresponded to variables within the AHA survey including licensed beds per facility, total gross square feet, burn care beds, and total staffed beds. Finally, the \u2018system\u2019 category contained components aligned with AHA survey items such as: whether the institution was part of a preferred provider organization or if the hospital participated in any joint venture arrangements with physicians. When disagreement occurred among our reviewers in relation to variable assignment, an evidence-based review was conducted with a discussion resulting in consensus. Item assignments within the four categories were then evaluated using a series of psychometric tests. After variable-category assignments were competed, external emergency management subject matter experts at the local, city, and federal levels independently reviewed the category-variable assignments for agreement.",

Registered hospitals consist of AHA member hospitals as well as nonmember hospitals. Community hospitals include all non-federal, short-term general and specialty hospitals as well as non-federal, short-term academic medical centers and other teaching hospitals. Health systems include either a multi-hospital system defined by two or more hospitals owned, leased, sponsored, or contract managed by a central organization or a diversified single hospital system. A health system can be a multi-hospital system, that is, two or more hospitals owned, leased, sponsored, or contract managed by a central organization, or a diversified single hospital system. In this study, we conducted our analysis based on hospitals only rather than aggregating them into systems or networks. The AHA database allows analysis of trends in utilization, personnel, revenues, and expenses across local, regional, and national markets. It contains more than 1000 data fields from over 6300 hospitals. The survey has a response rate above 75%. To address non-response and to complete missing data within the AHA survey, a standardized imputation methodology was employed based on previous responses. The AHA database contains information about hospital demographics, organizational structure, service lines and facilities, utilization data, physician arrangements, managed care relationships, hospital expenses, and staffing. For our analysis, we included all registered community-based hospitals in the United States, both for-profit and non-for-profit, that were operating in 2014.",

We also assessed distributions for numeric variables (e.g., the number of nurses, physicians, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, and technicians and their corresponding missing value patterns) (Kuhn and Johnson 2013). Near-zero variance was addressed by either combining categories or deleting the variable. Missing values were handled by applying the original AHA imputation algorithms (2018). We used the median number of hospital beds to stratify the overall sample. To evaluate statistical differences between groups, we used t tests and one-way ANOVA for numeric variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables.",

Oblique and orthogonal rotations were used to explore different factorial solutions underlying the data, using maximum likelihood as the extraction method.

In our proposed methodology, we take an initial step toward narrowing current measurement shortcomings by advancing the science of health care preparedness through the lens of daily health care delivery, developing a standardized medical surge index. The methodology described in this manuscript addresses two challenges: (1) the divide between priorities that shape daily hospital operations and tenets of hospital readiness and (2) the lack of an objective, transparent score to assess medical surge capacity at the hospital level. Lack of standardized and systematic metrics in these areas impacts our ability to accurately assess, plan, and finance optimal health care delivery during disasters. The disconnect between daily or routine health care and care during disasters is understandable, as health care executives and disaster planners often have very different priorities as a result of conflicting economic influences. Excess capacity, which is crucial to disaster planning, is simply not a financially profitable endeavor (Marcozzi 2018). Through an objectively quantified and systematically implemented medical surge index at the hospital level, decision-makers (hospitals, planners, providers, payers, policy makers) would transparently understand the implications of policies and their effect on hospital readiness.",

Medical surge was only one of these six, accounting for 12% of the total items included in the analysis. Kaji and Lewis (2008) designed a 79-item Johns Hopkins/AHRQ Hospital Disaster Drill Evaluation Tool that is used to assess hospital performance during disaster drills. This module-based tool encompasses four hospital areas: triage, incident command, decontamination, and treatment. It assigns scores based on questionnaire responses reflecting the ability to deliver medical care in times of crisis. Both of these studies evaluated the broader and less specific concept of disaster preparedness rather than surge capacity (Kaji and Lewis 2008).

Accordingly, these scores could also be used to establish synergies between hospitals to improve their collective response to a regional event. Regional and state emergency planners could utilize the HMPSI to evaluate regional and state preparedness at a population level through a composite score that encompasses all hospitals within a region or state. As depicted in Kelen and McCarthy\u2019s work, systems (i.e., policies and procedures) are a key component of surge capacity (2006). To meet the policy goals of recent federal health care legislation and remain financially solvent, many hospitals are emphasizing population health initiatives. A potential downside of this approach is that it may result in fewer resources of staff, space, and supplies within the inpatient setting.

The effect of these new technologies may require revision and updating of the AHA database to include these as variables within the four domains. Third, we did not assess external validity for the HMSPI, which would require external measurement of how hospitals and regions with different scores react during actual mass casualty incidents involving a sudden and significant demand for medical surge.

Additionally, the HMSPI could be used to assess the impact on hospital preparedness from changes in national, state, and local health policy. Finally, linking the index to other economic and health variables would be valuable. For instance, correlating this index with a hospital\u2019s payer mix or the surrounding community\u2019s burden of disease, injury or risk factors could help quantify their impact on a hospital\u2019s readiness.
