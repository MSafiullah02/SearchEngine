Since the outbreak has started, our hospital has been massively involved in the management of COVID-19 patients, requiring many clinicians to be reassigned to dedicated COVID-19 infected inpatients. The overload of hospitalisations and the distraction of doctors and nurses to this emergency situation, together with the limitations in travel even within the same area, has led to the need of a rapid change in the management of IBD patients at any level. IBD patients are severely worried about the impact of their disease and medications on the risk and the prognosis of COVID-19, and many of them are forced to come to hospital because of active disease, complications and drug administration. In order to maintain the quality standard of care,16 our unit has adopted several strategies [Figure 1].",

Specific web pages are available to give patients updated information on COVID-19 for IBD patients.17 The use of steroids during COVID-19 is controversial,18 but it seems that low-dose and short-term steroids are not associated with worse prognosis even in patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia,19 therefore they can be used to treat IBD flares in case of need. Thiopurines and JAK inhibitors can decrease the number of activated T-cells; however, we are not advising to stop these treatments in patients in remission with these agents, who strictly follow the preventive recommendations. Since there are no data in for or against monoclonal antibodies [although antiIL-6 agents appear to be promising for COVID-19 pneumonia20], patients continue their treatment; but we are postponing the start of new therapies if the patients has no symptoms [i.e., prevention of postoperative recurrence in patients with low-moderate risk of recurrence].",

Collaboration and communication between HCPs and patients is fundamental. The role of patients\u2019 associations together with IBD scientific societies is also crucial. Therapies should not be stopped, but alternative and safer ways of administration and remote monitoring should be considered. Patients should avoid leaving home especially because, beside the common risk of contracting SARS-CoV2 from air droplets, the additional risk of infection in public toilets cannot be excluded.
