            "text": "With the gap between the rich and the poor widening in developing countries, those who are well-to-do have adopted a different type of lifestyle, which involves change in diet and traditional way of living. These rapid changes in lifestyle have coincided with an increase in non-communicable/non-infectious diseases (NCD) (Beran et al. 2015; Kanguru et al. 2014; Kankeu et al. 2013; Lim et al. 2014; Tolu Oni and Unwin 2015) . Populations in the region are suffering from conditions which were once considered rare including cancers, diabetes, heart conditions and stroke. Diagnosis and treatment of NCD is a challenge in most developing countries as these require skills, equipment, medicines and care most of which are lacking in these regions (Elamin et al. 2015; Geissler and Leatherman 2015; Monroe et al. 1992; Vineis and Wild 2014) . Even after diagnosis, treatment of some NCD can be costly requiring a change in dietary needs and long-term prophylaxis, which is costly especially for the poor population. Non-communicable diseases have further increased the strain on livelihoods and quality of life in a region already carrying the burden of infectious diseases (ID). Lack of adequate treatment in some developing countries forces people to go and seek treatment in countries where this is available. This comes with enormous expenses that only those who have the resources can afford this venture (Burniston et al. 2015; Chuma et al. 2007;  1. 1 ",

Livelihood is a source of income, and loss of it could lead to poverty. Health status affects the ability of an individual to carry out their livelihood, affecting their source of income. Poor health can lead to poverty through loss of livelihood and income ( Fig. 1.1) , and loss of livelihood can adversely affect Fig. 1.1 Linking poverty health and livelihoods. Health, poverty and livelihoods are the three major factors that affect rural populations in developing countries; the determinants of poverty, health and livelihoods are indicated (black solid arrows); the dashed arrows show indicators that affect livelihoods (loss of livelihood) and health (poor health) leading to poverty health through increased poverty. It is in the context of this potentially vicious cycle that this book takes a look at developing countries and how ID and livelihoods affect each other in poor rural communities.",

Once the disease has been brought under control it is all forgotten. There is therefore need for continuity in community involvement to achieve effective control of zoonoses and infectious diseases. Raising awareness in the communities in high risk regions about disease prevention, epidemiology, and control could assist in reducing the disease burden. Involving the community in disease prevention and control strategies not only disseminates the important information regarding the disease but also a sense of ownership and responsibility. Often poor communities are treated as entities, where researchers, governments, NGOs and support organizations come and implement their ideologies without thorough engagement of communities. When these organizations leave upon completion of their projects, people go back to their usual habits and practices that put them at risk of disease. Due to poverty, poor communities are lured into projects and campaigns through handouts and other complements that are associated with their participation in the projects. This behaviour serves the interests of organizations conducting the projects to accomplish data collection or spend donor funding, but may have short-lived benefits for the communities. So how do we ensure that communities understand the risks of ID that are associated with their livelihood and lifestyle? Getting the communities involved from the beginning and helping these communities understand the diseases that surround them and the risks that their habits and livelihoods pose with regard to disease is one step towards disease prevention. Building up a knowledge base and setting up infrastructure to combat infectious disease prevention and control improves community awareness. When communities are aware of the dangers and ways of preventing them, and are included as part of the solution, it is more likely that they will be willing to participate. Imposing strategies on communities without proper disclosure shows lack of respect to their rights and traditions, and most are unwilling to participate.",

In many parts of Africa, Asia and the Pacific wild animals are part of the diet especially in the rural areas where people can still hunt and eat bush meat. Hunting is a livelihood and can be part of a tribal tradition passed on from generation to generation. Hunting brings people into close proximity with wild animals posing a high risk of contracting zoonotic diseases. For those populations where hunting is not part of their livelihood; livestock herders as well as farmers who from time to time go into the forests to find pasture and clear land for agriculture may also come into contact with wild animal habitats, putting them at risk of zoonotic diseases. In most developing countries, wild meat is seldom tested by veterinary personnel for diseases before consumption. It is very difficult to track the source of an EID, especially if different wild animals are slaughtered and consumed on a regular basis. Without records, it is very difficult to track the actual source of possible zoonoses. The preparation and consumption of the meat also differs from place to place. Some people drink the blood of the animals, others boil it, and others yet consume the internal organs of the animals including the intestines and the stomachs. The meat, blood, intestines and other internal organs are a source of bacteria, viruses and other parasites that could result in zoonoses. This puts at risk those handling the carcass, the people using the hide, those preparing the meat as well as those that consume the meat.",

Churches and religious leaders were at the forefront explaining the dangers of HIV/AIDS and the availability of medications that would help in prolonging lives. As these statements were made in public during funerals and public gatherings, people saw and understood the effects the disease had brought in their community, and attitudes started changing. The communities started opening up, families started opening up about their HIV status, and more people started going to clinics and hospitals for HIV testing. It has taken over two decades to reach this level of understanding. HIV/AIDS has created thousands of orphans in Africa and communities are working hard to bring awareness of the disease to both young and old. For example, in Malawi, children in primary school (between the ages of 5 and 12) and in secondary school (12-18 years of age) are taught about the dangers of HIV/AIDS and how they can contract it as well as avoid infection.

They are open to tell their friends and family members to go for HIV testing if they suspect they have the disease. Nevertheless, there are still some people who are not aware of their HIV status. Even though they may see all the symptoms of HIV/AIDS they still refuse to be tested. Some are aware of their HIV status and choose to be promiscuous in order to spread the disease. A study in Botswana showed that stigmatizing attitudes lessened 3 years after the introduction of the national programme providing access to treatment. A reduction in stigma was also observed in Tanzania with the introduction of the antiretroviral treatment (ART) (Allen and Heald 2004) .",

It is a main reason why too many people are afraid to see a doctor to determine whether they have the disease, or to seek treatment if so. It helps make AIDS the silent killer, because people fear social disgrace, of speaking about it, or taking easily available precautions. Stigma is a chief reason why the AIDS epidemic continues to devastate societies around the world.\" So can stigma be conquered? The answer lies with each and every one of us. To fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic, there is need to work together against stigma and discrimination.",

Infectious diseases pose a huge threat to health and livelihoods with enormous impacts on poor households and communities. Infectious diseases directly affect productivity and sustainability of livelihoods in poor rural communities with millions dying each year. Among these ID are zoonotic diseases which comprise most of the EID. Affecting both the consumers and those in close proximity with animals, there is need for collaboration between the health and veterinary sectors to prevent and control the spread of zoonotic diseases. Setting up infrastructure and develop a knowledge base within populations in developing countries regarding infectious disease control and prevention is needed to achieve long-term solutions. The risk of NTD and EID is ever present. Livelihoods expose individuals to diverse infectious disease-causing microorganisms which puts the human population at risk of these diseases.",
