            "text": "Characterization of LSECtin family members such as DC-SIGN suggest that LSECtin might act as a cell adhesion molecule in the immune system. To test this hypothesis we screened a series of cell lines to identify the LSECtin ligand by flow cytometry. We found that LSECtin\u2013Fc interacted with the CEM and Jurkat T cell lines (Figure 1\nA). Moreover, when tested after stimulation with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) combination with ionomycin, Jurkat T cells showed markedly increased binding of LSECtin, and this binding required the presence of Ca2+ because it was inhibited by addition of the calcium chelator ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (Figure 1\nB). We then sought to determine whether LSECtin receptor is expressed naturally on T cells in vivo. By using flow cytometry analysis, we found that LSECtin\u2013Fc specifically bound peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) activated by PMA and ionomycin, and this interaction could be inhibited completely by the addition of EGTA (Figure 1\nC). However, LSECtin did not bind nonactivated PBMCs. To verify T-cell binding, we purified either CD4+ or CD8+ cells from PBMCs by positive selection using antibody-coated magnetic beads. LSECtin showed strong binding to activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure 1\nD). To confirm the interaction of LSECtin and T cells at a cellular level, cell\u2013cell adhesion experiments were performed to assess the adhesion of peripheral blood T cells to LSECtin transfectants. Activated peripheral blood T cells specifically adhered to MCF7 cells expressing LSECtin compared with background binding to parental MCF7 cells. This binding was inhibited by a blocking antibody to LSECtin (Figure 1\nE and F), confirming the specificity of the interaction.",

            "text": "LSECtin has a typical carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and binds mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose in a Ca2+-dependent manner.12 Therefore, we sought to determine whether LSECtin binds to activated T cells through a protein\u2013glycan interaction, The binding of LSECtin to activated T cells actually was prevented by EGTA and saccharides such as D-mannose, N-GlcNAc, and L-fucose (Figure 2\nA). To assess the contribution of N- or O-linked glycosylation in LSECtin adhesion, activated T cells were cultured in the presence of tunicamycin or benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc, which could block the formation of proteins N- or O-glycosidic linkages, respectively. Tunicamycin abrogated the adhesion of T cells to LSECtin, whereas benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc did not (Figure 2\nB). Amino acid sequence alignment of the CRD of LSECtin with that of other C-type lectins indicates that 4 amino acids, Glu254, Asn256, Asn 274, and Asp275, interact with Ca2+ through their carbonyl groups, and Glu254/Asn256 exist in a conserved EPN motif, which is important for carbohydrate recognition.12, 19 Thus, we generated a series of LSECtin point mutants, including N256D, N274D, and D275A, in the soluble isoform. Alteration of each residue completely abolished the binding of LSECtin\u2013Fc to T cells (Figure 2\nC), compared with the control substitution L231A. These results indicate that LSECtin binds to activated T cells through a protein\u2013glycan interaction.",

We cultured peripheral blood T cells with anti-CD3 mAb and LSECtin\u2013Fc for 72 hours and found that the up-regulation of cell surface activation molecules, including CD69 and CD25, was inhibited by LSECtin (Figure 3\nA). Proliferation was estimated by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, and it was found that LSECtin significantly decreased T-cell proliferation stimulated by anti-CD3 (Figure 3\nB). To examine the effects of soluble LSECtin ligation on the production of cytokines, culture supernatants from T-cell proliferation assays, as shown previously, were harvested at 48 hours. Secretion of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-10 was inhibited significantly by LSECtin\u2013Fc, although the production of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 was not affected (Figure 3\nC). To further test whether LSECtin on the cell surface inhibits T-cell responses, we established a stably expressing CHO cell line of LSECtin (CHO\u2013LSECtin). PBMCs were co-cultured with irradiated CHO\u2013LSECtin cells or mock CHO cells and soluble anti-CD3 mAb for 48 hours. Membrane-bound LSECtin decreased the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in the culture supernatants of PBMCs; on the other hand, its siRNA reversed this effect (Figure 3\nD). The negative effect of LSECtin also was observed in the presence of anti-CD28 mAb (Figure 3\nE), suggesting that the suppression cannot be overcome by co-stimulation. To study antigen-specific signals, we examined the effects of LSECtin on T cells that were expressing an OVA-specific TCR transgene. The secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 was shown to be inhibited significantly by LSECtin\u2013Fc (Figure 3\nF).",

Among 96 G418-resistant ES clones, 4 (4.1%) positive clones were obtained via Southern blot verification (Figure 5\nB). Chimeric male mice were derived from these ES clones by standard procedures. They were crossed to C57BL/6 females, and heterozygous mutant mice were established from targeted ES clone G8. Heterozygous and homozygous LSECtin mutant mice then were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies (Figure 5\nC). To confirm the absence of LSECtin in these mice, the expression of LSECtin in the liver was estimated by reverse-transcription PCR analysis. As expected, LSECtin was detected in wild-type (wt) but not in KO liver (Figure 5\nD). The loss of LSECtin protein in liver also was confirmed by immunofluorescein staining (Figure 5\nE). These mice initially were back-crossed to the C57BL/6 background for at least 6 generations before they were used in the studies described.",

To determine the phenotype of accumulated T cells in the liver of LSECtin KO mice, we examined the expression of CD62L and CD44 on intrahepatic T cells. A fraction of intrahepatic T cells in LSECtin KO mice were CD62LloCD44Hi in comparison with normal mice (60% vs 45%), although no difference was found in the spleen of the same mice (Figure 6\nA), suggesting that a large number of these T cells were activated.

Inflammatory liver injury was exacerbated with increased serum ALT/AST, and more serious liver histologic damage was observed in the LSECtin KO compared with the wt mice (Figure 6\nD).

Moreover, the hepatic T cells of LSECtin KO mice were found to show higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 compared with wt mice (Figure 6\nF). We also investigated the in vivo silencing effect of siRNA duplexes targeting the LSECtin gene by delivering synthetic siRNA duplexes into the mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. In concordance with data from the LSECtin KO mice, the siRNA knock-down mice showed higher levels of plasma ALT and AST, serious liver histologic damage, and higher activity of hepatic T cells compared with wt mice (Supplementary Figure 3).

            "text": "The liver is a unique immunologic organ, functioning either as a site amenable to effective immune responses to pathogenic microorganisms or in the generation of tolerance to portally derived food and probiotic antigens. The dual functions of the liver require a delicate balance between immunity and tolerance.3, 21 The mechanisms behind the unique immune tolerance of liver have been elucidated in the past few years. One of the principal findings is that the T-cell biology in the liver is unlike that in any other organ, highlighted by the remarkable preference for the inactivation, tolerance, and apoptosis of hepatic T cells.4 In TCR transgenic mice, activated CD8+ T cells dispersed from the lymph nodes and spleen, and an increased number of activated CD8+ T cells simultaneously were found undergoing apoptosis in the liver.22 This phenomenon appears to be specific and is evident in a variety of in vivo model systems, suggesting that the liver is a \u201cgraveyard\u201d or \u201ckilling field\u201d for activated T cells.2 In a mouse liver transplant model, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found to infiltrate significantly and then undergo apoptosis in liver allografts.23 Moreover, many clinical investigations have shown that intrahepatic hepatitis C virus\u2013specific CD8+ T cells have functional alterations, including weak IFN-\u03b3 production, impaired proliferation, and enhanced apoptosis, which is associated with viral persistence and the progression of the disease to a chronic phase.24, 25 Obviously, the unique T-cell immune response contributes greatly to specific hepatic tolerance. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic immune regulation, however, have not been elucidated clearly.",

Dong et al26 discovered an important role for B7-H1 in controlling the deletion of activated intrahepatic CD8+ T cells in the liver via a PD-1\u2013independent mechanism.26 It is highly likely that hepatic immune regulation is multifactorial.

Its specific localization and roles in the negative regulation of T cells give rise to its important function in hepatic immunity and tolerance induction. Indeed, we showed that LSECtin negatively regulates T-cell receptor\u2013mediated signaling and T-cell immune response stimulated by plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb; this suppression could not be overcome by co-stimulation. Moreover, the role of LSECtin in the antigen-specific activation of T cells was analyzed using T cells from TCR transgenic mice and murine LSECs with physiologic levels of LSECtin expression. The lack of LSECtin in mice resulted in increased accumulation of T cells in the liver both in normal mice and in DO11.10 TCR transgenic T-cell transfer mice. In mice with T-cell\u2013mediated acute liver injury, KO of LSECtin accelerated the disease caused by an increased T-cell immune response, whereas exogenous administration of recombinant LSECtin protein or plasmid ameliorated the disease via down-regulation of T-cell immunity. Thus, our study provides important insight into the molecular mechanism of hepatic T-cell constraint based on investigation of the liver-specific C-type lectin LSECtin.",

It is noteworthy that several lectins also are localized to the liver, including galectin-1,7 DC-SIGN, and L-SIGN.28 None of the lectins, however, has been confirmed to be a T-cell regulator in liver thus far. In the present study, we showed that the liver-specific C-type lectin LSECtin recognized activated T cells and negatively regulated T-cell immune response in the liver. Our study not only expands the knowledge about C-type lectins in T-cell immune regulation, but also reveals a mechanism by which the T-cell homeostasis and tolerance of the liver is regulated by C-type lectin.",
