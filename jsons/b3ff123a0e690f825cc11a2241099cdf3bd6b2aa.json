Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) VP2 gene from the Australian classical strain 002/73, under the control of the FAV-10 major late promoter/leader sequence (MLP/LS) was inserted into a unique Not I site that was generated at 99.5 map units. This recombinant virus was produced without deletion of any portion of the FAV-10 genome. When administered to specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or intramuscularly, it was shown that the FAV-10/VP2 recombinant induced a serum VP2 antibody response and protected chickens against challenge with IBDV V877, an intermediate virulent classical strain. Birds were not protected when the recombinant was delivered via the conjunctival sac.",

The primary effect of this disease is the destruction of B-lymphocytes [27] and consequently the severe impairing of the chicken to develop antibodies to other avian pathogens or vaccines [42] . Vaccination of breeding hens sensitised by natural exposure, by live vaccine, or inactivated oil-emulsion vaccine, produces a long lasting high serum antibody response [36, 53] . Maternal antibodies are then transferred to the progeny chickens via the yolk sac providing protection for the first few critical weeks after hatching [53] . In recent times an emerging problem of bursal disease in the poultry industry has been with antigenic variants in the USA [46, 49, 50] and the very virulent strains in Europe [51] . These new antigenic strains of IBDV are able to escape from maternally derived antibodies induced by the classical strains. The emergence of these new strains has resulted in changes to vaccination regimes, with broilers being vaccinated in ovo or at 2-3 weeks of age when maternal antibody has declined, with more virulent vaccines. More recently there has been the successful use of an antibody-virus complex vaccine [52] .",

            "text": "IBDV is a member of the family Birnaviridae, and has two segments of double-stranded RNA [13] . A precursor polyprotein VP2-VP4-VP3, encoded on the larger genomic A segment is processed by autoproteolysis to produce viral proteins VP2, VP3 and VP4 [2, 3, 30, 31] . The amino acid sequence is highly conserved between the classical strains and antigenic variations are confined to the central region of the protein between residues 206 to 350 [5, 25, 34] , the conformational discontinuous host protective epitope [3] . Virus neutralizing (VN) mouse monoclonal antibodies are primarily directed against VP2 [3, 7, 18] . This protein has been the focus of attempts to produce new vaccines by recombinant DNA technology. VP2 expressed in E. coli reacted with a range of VN monoclonal antibodies, although the protein had been injected in milligram quantity [4] . Yeast expressed and purified VP2 was incorporated into an oil emulsion vaccine that was able to induce both virus neutralizing and ELISA antibodies in SPF chickens [19] . These antibodies were passed on to the progeny and gave protection when challenged with virulent IBDV. VP2 was also expressed in a fowlpox virus recombinant [6] . Significant levels of protection were provided by vaccination with this recombinant, although the level of protection was lower than that provided by an inactivated oil emulsion vaccine containing whole IBDV [26] . Finally, a herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) recombinant expressing VP2 induced protection against virulent IBDV challenge [12] .",

The recombinant was plaque purified three times and genomic DNA analysed by restriction digestion and Southern blot comparison to parental FAV-10 DNA (data not shown). In order to confirm that the insertion of a Not I site had not interrupted any functional transcription unit, day old SPF chickens were vaccinated via the conjunctival sac with 10 7 pfu of rFAV-10/Not I. At day 7 and B The recombinant FAV-10/VP2 was generated as follows: The plasmid pMS212 (Nde I fragment 3/Not I) was digested with Not I and the Not I fragment containing the MLP/SL-VP2-poly A expression cassette from pMS251 ligated in, resulting in plasmid pMS268. The plasmid pMS268 was digested with Nde I-Apa I and mixed with FAV-10 Spe I fragment 1 and transfected into CK cells using a calcium chloride procedure. Virus was plaque purified and screened for the presence of the VP2 gene day 10 post vaccination, kidneys were removed, homogenised and plated onto CK cell monolayers. Cultures were passaged 2-3 times until cytopathic effect (c.p.e.) was observed. Genomic DNA was prepared, restriction digested with Not I, Southern blotted and probed with FAV-10 Nde I fragment 3. The results (not shown) confirmed that rFAV-10/Not I replicated in vivo and that no functional transcription unit was interrupted. We then constructed a second recombinant, not deleting any of the FAV-10 genome but took advantage of the 105% genome packaging availability of the virus capsid [8, 24] . The VP2 gene from the Australian strain 002/73 of IBDV [25] was inserted into the major late promoter expression cassette (Fig. 3b) . The VP2 expression cassette was then cloned into the Not I site of Nde I fragment 3 in plasmid pMS212. The resulting recombination expression cassette plasmid pMS268 was transfected FAV-10 Spe I fragment 1, a recombinant virus, rFAV-10/VP2 isolated and plaque purified three times (Fig. 3b) . The recombinant was analysed by restriction digestion and Southern blots, probed with IBDV VP2 DNA or FAV-10 Nde I fragment 3 (data not shown). The immunogenicity of the VP2 expressed by the recombinant in cell cultures was further analysed in an antigen capture ELISA. The recombinant expressed VP2 was shown to react strongly with the neutralising monoclonal antibody 17-82 [21] .",

As was shown in experiment 1, detectable antibodies to VP2 were present 14 days post vaccination with rFAV-10/VP2 (not shown) and increased by 21 days post inoculation. High VP2 antibody levels correlated with high FAV-10 antibodies in the recombinant vaccinated group 1. To examine the efficacy of the recombinant vaccine, groups 1-4 were challenged with IBDV strain V877. Group 5 birds (unvaccinated) were not challenged. Chickens vaccinated at 3 weeks i.v. with rFAV-10/VP2 were protected from challenge with IBDV V877. In contrast, birds vaccinated with FAV-10 or unvaccinated birds were not protected from challenge as shown in Table 3 . All chickens vaccinated with either Bursavac K or rFAV-10/VP2 had detectable levels of VP2 antibodies and unvaccinated chickens or chickens vaccinated with FAV-10 only, had no detectable VP2 antibodies (not shown).

            "text": "Since the early 1980s adenoviruses, herpesviruses and poxviruses have been investigated as candidates for use as live vectors for the delivery of vaccines. Generally, when constructing an adenovirus vector, either the E3 region (replication competent) or the E1 region (replication defective) is deleted and a foreign gene is inserted [9, 10, 22, 23, 25, 29, 32, 33, 37-41, 44, 45] . We chose to avoid both of these regions and instead inserted the IBDV VP2 gene into a non-coding region that was identified in the right hand end of the genome just upstream of the inverted terminal repeat. This site was chosen as it did not appear to disrupt any FAV gene expression. The FAV major late promoter and leader sequences [47] were chosen to express the IBDV VP2 gene as opposed to a heterologous promoter. Packaging ability and stability of recombinant human adenoviruses have been shown to be limited to approximately 105% of the original genome [8, 24] . The FAV-10 genome is some 10 kb larger than the HAV genome. Based on these criteria, it is possible that a foreign insert of up to 2.3 kb could be integrated into the FAV-10 genome without requiring deletion of any part of genome. The VP2 expression cassette consisting of FAV-10 MLP/LS VP2 coding region and SV40 polyA region totaled 2.1 kb and it was decided to insert this expression cassette without deleting any of the FAV-10 genome. The Nde I fragment 3 (90.8 to 100 map units) was chosen as a potential region for the possible insertion of the expression cassetle. Sequencing of this fragment revealed a number of unidentified open reading frames and a Bam HI restriction site 243 bp from the right hand end of the genome. Sequence analysis suggested that this site was in a transcriptionally active region. A Not I site was inserted into the Bam HI site as Not I does not cleave the FAV-10 genome at any other site or the expression cassette and a recombinant virus was generated which contained a unique Not I site. Inoculation of SPF birds, re-isolation in CK monolayers and analysis by restriction digesion demonstrated that this recombinant was stable and viable in vitro and in vivo. It was concluded that this region of FAV-10 was not transcriptionally active and therefore ideal for the insertion of an expression cassette. The MLP/SL-VP2-polyA expression cassette was inserted into the Not I site of Nde I fragment 3, and the resulting fragment was used to generate a recombinant FAV-10 that contained the IBDV VP2 gene (rFAV-10/VP2) by homologous recombination. The VP2 antigen expressed by the recombinant was immunogenic as tested by its reactivity with the conformational dependent neutralising monoclonal antibody 17-82.",

Vaccination with rFAV-10/VP2 protected birds from challenge with live IBDV V877 as no IBDV was detected in bursal homogenates by antigen ELISA and immunoperoxidase staining of tissue section. Thus, the recombinant stimulated an immune response that was able to prevent IBDV from replicating in the bursa. All birds that were naive, that is unvaccinated or FAV-10 vaccinated, were not protected from challenge with IBDV V877. IBDV antigen was detected by the antigen ELISA on bursa homogenates and by immunohistology for the presence of IBDV in tissue sections. Therefore, in these naive birds, there were deficient antibody levels to provide protection against IBDV challenge. Fahey et al. [17] demonstrated that there was a direct correlation between maternal serum antibody levels and protection with titres of 400 or greater providing complete protection against IBDV. Further, it is now known that serum IBDV antibody levels correlate well with serum neutralising antibody levels, implying that the majority of the serum neutralising antibodies are directed against VP2 (Ignjatovic and Sapats, pers. comm.). The fact that the rFAV-10/VP2 reported in this study induced pre-challenge antibody titres averaging greater than 4 000 directed specifically against VP2 (the major protective antigen) demonstrated the use of this recombinant virus as an effective vaccine vector, not only against IBDV, but potentially against other poultry pathogens.",

Although the systemic routes used in this report are not what are commercially acceptable for delivery of vaccines, the data demonstrated that a recombinant adenovirus vector could potentially be developed for commercial application. Bird s vaccinated systemically (i.v., i.p., i.m., s.c.) developed antibodies to FAV-10 and VP2. Birds vaccinated by instillation of the conjunctival sac, developed antibodies to FAV-10 later than that seen for vaccination by systemic routes, but failed to produce any detectable antibodies to VP2. Vaccination of chickens via the conjunctival sac is essentially oral administration, as fluid delivered drains into the naso-pharyngeal cavity and is swallowed by the bird. Virus re-isolation experiments showed that recombinant virus could be found in the caecal tonsils but was less easily isolated from kidney, liver or spleen (2-3 passages in CK cells) compared with systemically vaccinated birds (1 passage in CK cells). Therefore, FAV-10 replication in natural infection is mainly in the gut and has limited systemic spread. The inefficiency of FAV-10 in crossing the gut is probably due to differences in the cell receptor binding regions present on the fiber. It has been shown for some human adenoviruses that a few amino acid changes in the fiber can determine tissue tropism [1] . In HAV type 5, a region has been identified which binds to the MHCI alpha 2 domain found on the surface of epithelial and \u2424-lymphoblastoid cells [28] . No receptor binding regions have been identified for any FAV fiber. It has been demonstrated with FAV serotype 8 [43] , that virulence is function of the short fiber, and that swapping the short fiber from a hypervirulent to a mildly virulent strain resulted in the corresponding phenotypic change. Unlike serotype 8, which has a short fiber [43] , with the long fiber not yet located, serotype 10 has both a short [48] and long fiber (unpubl.) in similar positions on the genome relative to that of serotype 1 (CELO) [11] . Further, it appears that the long fiber of FAV-10 is of similar amino acid sequence length to the short fiber (unpubl.) It is likely that the lack of virulence of FAV-10, presumably determined by the short fiber, and correlated with tissue tropism, explains why vaccination via conjunctiva faild to induce a serum VP2 antibody response sufficient to protect birds from challenge. However, when delivered by systemic inoculation, FAV-10 has the ability to bind and infect cells of other organs and subsequently replicate.",

The sequence of the VP2 gene from 002/73 is identical to that of the challenge strain V877 (Ignjatovic and Sapats, personal communication). V877 is an intermediate virulent classical strain, which is being used as a vaccine against the very virulent strains of Europe and Asia. It will be of great interest to further test this recombinant and examine whether it can protect commercial broilers against all very virulent IBDV strains and the antigenic variant IBDV strains of the USA.",
