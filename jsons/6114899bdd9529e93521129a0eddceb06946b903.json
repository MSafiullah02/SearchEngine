For instance, the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is typically 5\u2212 6 days, whereas the average incubation period for influenza is 2 days, 2 and diarrhea can be a presenting feature in SARS-CoV-2 patients. 3 New research indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may be spread by fecal\u2212oral transmission. 4 The highest SARS-CoV-2 mortality and morbidity is in the elderly and in those with underlying health problems that are associated with inflammation and other disorders, such as diabetes. 5 Interestingly, these cohorts tend to have less diverse gut microbiomes. 6 Links between the gut microbiome and age-related health decline have been consistently shown. 7 Aging is associated with significant shifts in microbiome diversity and proinflammatory states. The elderly microbiome generally shows a shift away from Firmicutes, which dominates in younger adults, toward genera such as Alistipes and Parabacteroides. 8 A strong interindividual variability has been characterized in the elderly gut microbiome, with fluctuations featuring Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus as well as certain Clostridium clusters, especially IV and XIVa.

Interestingly, asthma appears to be underrepresented among comorbidities for critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. 9 In severe asthma, asthma control and sputum neutrophilia are associated with Proteobacteria phylum relevant to pathogens such as Escherichia, Salmonella, Vibrio, and Helicobacter. 10 Additionally, in chronic obstructive airways disease, the phylum Bacteroidetes (e.g., Prevotella) is decreased. 10 In contrast, the numbers of the H 2 -producing Prevotellaceae (e.g., Prevotella) were highly enriched in obese individuals prone to type II diabetes. 11 Additionally, an abundance of Bif idobacteria (which can produce butyrate) in type II diabetes patients has been shown to improve glucose tolerance. 12 In relation to this issue, attention should be given to interesting, but limited, reports regarding the abundance of Prevotella in sequencing data sets of COVID-19 patients. 13\u221215 An essential step for understanding the effect of the gut on SARS-CoV-2 is identifying the main gut microbiome species interacting with this virus. In this regard, the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can interact with one or many of the 1500 species of microbiota in the gut makes the matter complicated. As such, without any human trials, it is impossible to refer to any specific species that influences SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. However, it is possible to consider the hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 gut interaction based on past evidence. Many different direct or indirect microbiome pathways could contribute to SARS-CoV-2-gut interactions. Considering the pulmonary inflammation seen in SARS-CoV-2 patients in the second week of infection, both direct or indirect pathways can be taken into consideration. Direct suppression or promotion of viral infection by the microbiome can occur via various mechanisms, such as genetic recombination, alteration of virion stability, driving the proliferation of cells, simulating attachment to permissive cells, and contributing to viral replication suppression; promotion of viral infection may occur by inducing systems' immunoregulatory and perturbing local immune responses. 1 Although reports on direct and indirect viral bacterial promotion for influenza viruses are rare, examples of observed suppression are manifold. Lactobacillus species, as a result of carbohydrate fermentation, can produce lactic acid, and the consequent pH changes inactivate different viruses. 1 The integrity of epithelial cells in the gut is important, as they produce antiviral compounds that are hostile to viruses. The colonic epithelial cells' functionality relies largely on the luminal presence of butyrate as an energy source, and the main butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut belongs to the phylum Firmicutes.",

Cytokines are small proteins that coordinate the body's response against infection and inflammation. For example, type II interferon (interferon-\u03b3) classically play important roles in antiviral responses. 16 More importantly, microbial metabolic processes in the gut strongly impact the production of cytokines. Microbiota can increase chronic phase proteins and interferon signaling in lung cells to protect against influenza infection. However, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the body's response to infection can go into overdrive. In some patients, the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 results in excessive levels of cytokines release, leading to hyperinflammation and, clinically, to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARDS) and multi-organ failure. So far, a cytokine profile associated with SARS-CoV-2 disease severity has been characterized by increased interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10 as well as many other cytokines. 2 Therefore, the elucidation of host cytokine molecular pathways and microbiota components 17 as well as bacterial reactions in association with cytokine responses may provide novel microbiome-based therapeutic approaches to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

It is still not known whether Prevoltella becomes abundant as a consequence of viral modulation or, conversely, is modulating SARS-CoV-2. It is unclear if this abundance of Prevotella is due to long-standing dietary patterns or originates from modulation of the microbiome after the invasion of the virus. Depending on whether Prevotella's presence should be amplified or suppressed, the appropriate therapeutic action could be chosen. Past studies suggest that high-fat diets increase the abundance of Prevotella, whereas plant-based diets and fermented foods result in the opposite. 18 As general advice, frequent snacking between meals may cause dysbiosis and so should be kept to a minimum and only constitute fruit and vegetables, if required. The impact of probiotics should also be investigated. Probiotics may help by interacting with the intestinal microbiota and modulating the immune system directly or through modification of the gut microbiota. The most commonly regarded beneficial probiotics in foods are Bif idobacteria and Lactobacilli species. In this regard, while still not having any full knowledge about beneficial or harmful strains, diets adhering to modest qualities of naturally fermented food are likely to be effective as preventative measures against SARS-CoV-2 and are of no risk for damaging the integrity of the gut and dysbiosis (Figure 1) . Without having knowledge about the best acting microbiota strains in response to SARS-CoV-2, following a healthy, moderate calorie, moderately higher fiber, and more diverse diet is a logical approach to mitigate the severity of this viral infection as a plausible preventive action.
