Many of these individuals appear to be carriers; that is, this streptococal species behaves as a commensal, does not elicit an antibody response, and at least for a time blends into the \"normal flora.\"31 Studies in the past with intramuscular penicillin (benzathine penicillin G) had shown nearly uniform success in clearing S. pyogenes from the oral mucosa. Slightly lower cure rates were reported for oral penicillin preparations, probably because of poor compliance with the full lo-day course of therapy.

In addition to Staphylococcus aureus, the oropharyngeal cavity may normally harbor a number of other aerobic and anaerobic organisms that have the potential to produce p-lactamase. These organisms include various Bacteroides and Hemophilus species and Branhamella catarrhalis. In studies of children with recurrent tonsillitis who underwent tonsillectomy, Brook and Yocum were able to correlate the presence of plactamase activity measured directly in tonsillar tissue with recovery of p-lactamase-producing flora from culture of the tonsils. 44 In a subsequent clinical trial, 100 children with acute Group A streptococcal tonsillitis were treated with a lo-day course of an oral penicillin.41 Sixty-three of the children were bacteriologically cured, and 37 were considered treatment failures. Prior to therapy, p-lactamaseproducing organisms were recovered from oral cultures of 25% of the 63 children who were cured compared with 68% of the 37 children for whom treatment failed. Also p-lactamase producing organisms were present in significantly larger numbers in the nonresponders than in the responders. Other data suggest that penicillin treatment itself promotes the emergence of a penicillin-destroying flora45146 and that these resistant strains may be transferred to household contacts.46 Further evidence to support the role of 8-lactamase-producing bacteria in streptococcal treatment failures comes from an experimental model in which a mixed subcutaneous abscess containing both a penicillin-susceptible Group A streptococcus and a /3-lactamase-positive strain of Boxtertides species is produced in mice. In these studies, mice treated with either clindamycin (active in vitro against both isolates and not susceptible to plactamase) or penicillin in combination with a p-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) had a greater reduction in abscess size and in total number of streptococci recoverable on culture than did untreated control animals or those receiving penicillin alone.47 Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that greater cure rates in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis might be achieved by one of several therapeutic strate-gies:", "cite_spans": [{"start": 960, "end": 962, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of the Normal Flora in Strecdococcal Treatment Failures"}, {"text": "1.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of the Normal Flora in Strecdococcal Treatment Failures"}, {"text": "Use of an antimicrobial (with or without penicillin) which is not susceptible to plactamase.

On the contrary, rheumatic fever has all but vanished from suburban America. One county in California reported 430,000 cases of streptococcal illness over an 11-year interval but only three cases of rheumatic fever.55 Similarly, the incidence of acute rheumatic fever among whites in suburban and rural parts of Shelby County (Tennessee) was only one case per 200,000 school children annually over the 5-year period from 1977 through 1981.56 Rheumatic fever rates are somewhat higher in inner city areas of major United States metropolitan centers and higher yet among large segments of the developing world in Asia, Africa, or South America.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2."}, {"text": "It is difficult to define precisely the contribution of penicillin to the downward trend in rheumatic fever incidence. Considerable evidence exists, however, that antibiotic use may not be the primary factor and that the principal reason for the decline is actually a change in the \"rheumatogenicity\" of prevalent streptococcal strains.57 In fact, the decrease in incidence of rheumatic fever antedated the discovery of penicillin and began even before the causative relationship to Group A streptococci was known. Older studies, done when rheumatic fever was more common, indicate that about one third of patients with rheumatic fever do not recall a preceding respiratory tract infection and thus would not have received treatment for a streptococcal infection. If penicillin therapy were the only reason for the decline in incidence of rheumatic fever, one might anticipate that among newly diagnosed cases, the proportion who had an asymptomatic streptococcal pharyngitis and consequently did not receive penicillin would be higher. Instead, Land and Bisnos recently reported that of 41 patients with rheumatic fever diagnosed between 1977 and 1982,31.7% denied a preceding upper respiratory infection or sore throat-a figure nearly identical to the 34% figure cited in a study published 13 years ear1ier.u How important then is the lessened efficacy of penicillin preparations for streptococcal pharyngitis noted in recent studies? Clearly, inadequate bacteriologic responses have not been associated with a resurgence in rheumatic fever cases in this country, nor apparently with a rise in suppurative complications or a poorer clinical response during acute infection.

Endemic cases cannot be diagnosed reliably on clinical grounds alone unless the characteristic rash of scarlet fever is present.

In 10% of cases, a second throat culture is necessary to detect the organism, which, under this circumstance, is usually present in low numbers and possibly not etiologic for the pharyngitis.@ The clinical dilemma has been whether or not to give antibiotics during the usual 24-48 hour period it takes to process throat cultures.
