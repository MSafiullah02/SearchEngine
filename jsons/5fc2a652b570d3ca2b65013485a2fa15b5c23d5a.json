As a result, the management of COVID-19 patients including those who are critically ill remains supportive. Reports from China suggested that an exaggerated immune response may play a role in the development of respiratory failure, shock, and multiorgan dysfunction in critically ill patients with COVID-19 1 . Similarities between the exaggerated immune response associated with COVID-19 or sepsis in general and the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) reported in patients with CAR T-cell therapy led to the use of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 therapy to attenuate hyperimmune responses associated with COVID 2 .",

            "text": "is similar to other studies where diagnoses are based on coding. Restriction to only microbiologically proven cases would likely miss a majority of infections and may capture contaminants.Host response to the pathogen during sepsis is a double-edged sword. Cytokines such as IL-6 may contribute to organ injury and death, but they are also central to innate immunity and microbial clearance. While there may be a subset of patients who may potentially benefit from the use of tocilizumab, current evidence does not support the routine use of tocilizumab or other drugs that regulate host immune response (i.e., corticosteroids, anti-IL1, anti-TNF\u03b1) in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 sepsis. Proper discriminatory values that reliably identify patients in whom hyper-inflammation is the key driver of pathogenesis remain poorly defined. While there is evidence of efficacy for IL-6 blockade in rheumatological diseases and to manage complications of T cell engaging therapies, which are driven by a primary immune response, there is no evidence that immune blockade is clinically beneficial when microbial infections drive the host response. Indeed, a previous anti-cytokine strategy targeting TNF\u03b1 increased mortality in septic patients7 and was linked to increased risk of infections8 . While COVID-19 may share clinical features with CAR-T cell-induced CRS, this does not necessarily imply that the syndromic similarities are causally related. Use of experimental therapies outside of properly controlled clinical trials impairs the ability for definitive evaluation of cause and effect and could bring about untoward and possibly lethal side effects. Our findings should raise physician awareness about the potential side effects of tocilizumab on pathogen clearance and development of secondary infections. It also calls for the urgent need to study all drugs including any immunosuppressive agents in randomized controlled trials to better understand their role in any hyperimmune response and on clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and other hospital-acquired pathogens.",
