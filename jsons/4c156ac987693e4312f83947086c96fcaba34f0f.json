On the other hand, the system of differential equations give more information than the single equation for N (t). In particular, the ratio, R(t) (see appendix), between symptomatic and asymptomatic populations is plotted as a function of time in fig. 6 . Moreover, one can evaluate in a more reliable way the lethality of the infection, defined as the ratio of the number of dead individuals and the total number of infected ones. The italian lethality is 13% neglecting the asymptomatic population, but, in our model, its value reduces to \u2243 3% considering the total infected population.",
