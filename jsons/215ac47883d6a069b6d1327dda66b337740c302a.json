            "text": "Many experimental strategies have been adopted in experiments to protect cats from FIV infection by vaccination, and some have been successful. The interest in developing a vaccine arose both because FIV is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in pet cats and because the feline virus provides a model for its counterpart in man, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for which an effective vaccine is urgently required to halt the current tragic pandemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Shortly after the discovery of FIV and its characterization as a lentivirus, 54 attempts were made to produce a vaccine and success was soon achieved with relatively simple inactivated virus or inactivated virus-infected cell vaccines. 82 Further development of this approach led to the introduction in 2002 of the first commercial vaccine against FIV. 59 With an estimated prevalence of the infection of up to 25% in populations of pet cats, an effective FIV vaccine could have a significant influence on animal welfare. In addition, this success poses the question of whether a similar strategy might produce an effective vaccine against HIV.",

            "text": "Many candidate HIV vaccines have been constructed and a number are currently undergoing clinical trials in human populations. The results from the first phase III trial, which was designed to test the ability of a vaccine based on the envelope surface glycoprotein (SU) to protect against exposure to HIV in a high-risk population, were not encouraging. Much of the slow progress in producing HIV vaccines to take to phase III trials is because there is no ideal surrogate host in which to carry out experiments that would confidently predict whether a candidate vaccine was indeed protective or would identify the correlates of protection. Even in the chimpanzee, the putative source of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from which HIV was originally derived, the dynamics of experimental HIV infection are sufficiently different from those in man to render the model problematic. SIV itself is a plausible model system in which to test vaccine strategies and has been used extensively for this purpose as described in Chapters 5 and 6. Although these simian viruses do not appear to cause disease in their natural hosts-various primate species in Africathey do cause a fatal immunodeficiency upon inoculation of Asian macaques that is very similar to human AIDS. This outcome may very well mimic the situation that has developed in man, who has yet to coevolve sufficiently with HIV to render that virus less pathogenic. Many SIV vaccines have been tested in macaques, but still there is no consensus about what constitutes a vaccine that could serve as an example for HIV. The apparent effectiveness of the recently introduced commercial FIV vaccine raises the questions of how good FIV is as a comparative model system for HIV in vaccination studies, and what weight should be put on the results from FIV vaccine trials in making decisions about the type of HIV vaccine to be tested in clinical trials in man.",

Thus, FIV has a different genome content and organization from HIV, as illustrated in Figure 1 . In nature FIV is transmitted mainly by biting, rather than through a mucosal surface like HIV. Following infection, a proportion of infected cats develop AIDS, although many individuals do not develop terminal disease. 1 To enter cells, primary isolates of FIV use CD134 as a receptor 66 and CXCR4 as a coreceptor. 78 In contrast HIV-1 uses CD4 as a primary receptor and CCR5 and other chemokine receptors, including CXCR4, as a coreceptor. However, despite these differences, both viruses critically target CD4 + T lymphocytes and the outcome of infection is remarkably similar in cats and man. In the present context, the dynamics of infection and the resulting immune response are so much alike following infection with either virus that FIV should be able to provide valuable information to aid the development of HIV vaccines. It is the common features of FIV and HIV rather than their differences that should guide us to the essential requirements for successful protection by vaccination against each infection.",

A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of representative FIV and HIV sequences (FIV Petaluma M25381 and HIV NC_001802) reveals an overall homology of approximately 63% in gag-pol and 76% in env. The corresponding proteins exhibit lower homology of 43% and 35% respectively (comparisons made using GCG Bestfit, University of Wisconsin). The feline pol gene, like HIV, encodes protease, integrase, and reverse transcriptase proteins, which have analogous functions in each of the viruses. FIV pol also encodes an additional enzyme, deoxyuridine pyrophosphatase (DU), not found in primate lentiviruses, which reduces cellular concentrations of dUTP, preventing viral mutations due to its misincorporation into viral cDNA. The activity of viral DU is particularly important in nondividing cells such as macrophages, which have low endogenous levels of the host enzyme. FIV mutants lacking DU are consequently unable to replicate productively in macrophages. 40 Although DU is absent in HIV, its role is assumed by HIV Vpr, which directs incorporation of uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2) into HIV virions, thereby reducing misincorporation of uracil and facilitating replication in macrophages. 9 FIV MODEL FOR AIDS VACCINE STUDIES 295 ",

Rev mediates nuclear export by binding to the Rev response element (RRE). For FIV the RRE is located 3\u00a2 to the transmembrane (TM) protein of Env, whereas in HIV the RRE is 5\u00a2 to TM. The vif (viral infectivity factor) gene is also common to both FIV and HIV and functions in a similar way for both viruses. Vif expression is critical for viral dissemination in vivo and infection of nonpermissive cells including lymphocytes and macrophages. Recent evidence has shown that HIV Vif acts by abrogating the effect of the cellular antiretroviral factor APOBEC3G, 65 and it is likely that FIV Vif acts in an analogous manner. FIV lacks a tat gene and its corresponding transactivation response (TAR) element. Additionally, the FIV genome does not encode Nef, Vpr, or Vpu. It does, however, encode an additional accessory protein designated ORF-A or ORF-2. ORF-A was initially considered as a tat-like gene because of its ability to transactivate viral transcription at low levels. However, it shares several properties with HIV Vpr, including nuclear localization and induction of G2 cell cycle arrest. 22 Knowledge of the genetic structure of FIV allows the use of virus mutants as experimental vaccines. For example, the deletion of accessory genes such as ORF-A or vif can result in the production of attenuated viruses that can be utilized as vaccines. 43 DNA vaccines have also been produced using full-length molecular clones of provirus, which are rendered replication defective by in-frame deletion of either the reverse transcriptase or integrase genes. 16, 29 ",

Thus, in the first few days following experimental inoculation, the virus grows in dendritic cells, macrophages, and CD4 + T lymphocytes and is found in the plasma within 2 weeks. The level of virus in the plasma and proviral DNA in the blood mononuclear cells rises over a period, reaching a peak at about 8 to 12 weeks. During this period, mild to moderate clinical signs, for example anorexia, depression, and pyrexia, may be observed that are associated with the initial uninhibited growth of the virus. These conditions generally subside rapidly, although signs such as generalized lymphadenopathy, due to increased numbers and size of active germinal centers in the cortex of the lymph nodes, may continue for several weeks or months. The fall in plasma viral load heralds the beginning of the socalled asymptomatic phase that can last for many years, and in many cases for life, during which the cat is quite healthy. It is assumed that virus replication is brought under control by the developing immune response to the virus. CD8 + FIV-specific cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) can be detected in the blood within one week of infection. 3 Rather later, at around the same time as the peak in virus load, anti-FIV antibodies, including virus neutralizing antibodies, appear in the plasma. 17 Another hallmark of early FIV infection by certain isolates is the appearance of a population of CD8 + T-cells termed CD8 low , 77 which has the phenotype a + /b low . These cells serve as a marker of immune activation by more virulent strains of FIV and functionally may contribute to the noncytolytic activity for FIV mediated by CD8 + T-cells.",

In one experiment, in which cats were infected as kittens with the FIV-GL8 strain and were maintained for 10 years, approximately half of the cats developed serious and ultimately fatal conditions that could be ascribed to the infection (John Callanan, personal communication). By contrast, in a completely closed household of 26 pet cats observed over a 10-year period, natural FIV spread slowly among the cats but did not appear to cause any significant disease. 1 Clearly, in vaccine trials with FIV or HIV, the efficacy of vaccination must be measured by the capacity of the vaccine to prevent infection rather than disease.",

As noted above, the responses that accompany FIV infection and are presumed to play a major role in inhibiting viral infection are the induction of CTL and virus neutralizing antibodies. Although our ability to define precisely the details of feline immune responses is fairly rudimentary because of a relative lack of reagents, compared to those available for man and macaques, there is in fact very little difference between FIV, SIV, and HIV in our understanding of the appropriate immune responses that block viral infection. Early studies on HIV vaccination concentrated on raising virus neutralizing antibodies and hence on generating vaccines that incorporated SU that contains the targets for these antibodies. It was considered desirable to include antigens that could induce antibodies that would neutralize viruses of as many clades of virus as possible. Later research concluded that CTL were crucial in protective immunity and several vaccine approaches have been developed, which include peptide epitopes recognized by appropriate haplotypes of populations in which the vaccine might be applied.

            "text": "The classical method of antigenic typing of viruses is by virus neutralization. Unfortunately, as for HIV, the measurement of virus neutralizing antibodies against FIV has been, and remains, difficult. In early studies, neutralization by sera, from infected or vaccinated cats of FIV adapted for growth in the feline fibroblast cell line CRFK, was reported. 17 However, this type of CRFK-tropic, and probably CD134-independent, FIV does not represent the majority of viruses that are isolated from naturally infected cats and are probably transmitted in the field (Hayley Haining and Margaret Hosie, personal communication). It is likely that neutralization of these viruses in this assay is mediated through blocking of the interaction between the V3 region of SU and CXCR4 by anti-V3 antibodies, as virus neutralizing antibodies can be completely absorbed by a peptide that represents the V3 loop (Robert Osborne, personal communication). Cats vaccinated with an inactivated virus vaccine that had high levels of virus neutralizing antibodies measured in this way were protected from challenge with the CRFK-tropic FIV-Pet but were only partially protected against FIV-GL8. 32 These antibodies may have contributed to protection from FIV-Pet, although this is not known for certain. However, it is unlikely that anti-V3 antibodies alone were responsible, because in other experiments cats vaccinated with V3 peptides that include an immunodominant B-cell epitope were not protected against FIV-Pet. 44 These findings suggest that other immune mechanisms are required for protection against most naturally occurring viruses.",

Do clades represent different antigenic types and if so, should vaccines be designed to include antigens of the prevalent clade(s) in a particular geographic area? FIV appears to be an excellent model in which to answer these questions. FIV exists in at least 5 clades or subtypes (A-E), and in some geographical areas these clades are distinct. Thus, in analyses of FIV isolates made in Italy and the UK, it was found that all of the Italian isolates belonged to clade B, 55 while all of the UK isolates were of clade A (Alexandra M\u00fcller and Mauro Pistello, personal communication) . In Austria and southern Germany there appears to be a mixture of the two clades, including recombinants. 69 This curious distribution may be due to the patterns of migration of cats and the evolution of FIV in these cat populations. Additional clades and recombinants have been identified throughout the world. 62 Unfortunately it has not yet been possible to resolve the issue of whether FIV clades represent serotypes because of the difficulties in antigenic typing using virus neutralization, as described above. An indication that there may be clade-specific differences comes from a comparison of the neutralization of viruses representing five different clades, 36 although insufficient isolates were examined to provide a comprehensive view of antigenic relationships. A potential further complication is the finding of type-specific neutralization within viruses of clade A using the CRFKbased assay. 52 There have been few reports of antigenic relationships between primary FIV isolates, predictably because of the technical difficulties encountered. One study of 15 Italian isolates of clade B confirmed their resistance to neutralization and failed to reveal any correlation between behavior in neutralization assays and genetic relatedness or epidemiological distribution. 13 Experience in the UK with clade A viruses has been similar (Alexandra M\u00fcller, personal communication). This resistance appears to be highly conserved in FIV, as infection of cats with neutralization-sensitive virus results in the evolution of a neutralizationresistant population with time. 4 Clearly this is a very important field of study that urgently requires further effort to clarify.",

The commercial vaccine derived from that experimental vaccine protected completely against a further clade B virus. 58 This information is of practical significance as FIV of clade B is widely distributed in the United States and parts of Europe.

As described previously, the primary receptor for FIV is CD134 66 and the coreceptor is CXCR4. 78 It is probable that the viruses transmitted in nature, accordingly most relevant to vaccine development, require both of these molecules for virus entry into cells. Viruses in a minority of primary isolates of FIV, as well as certain \"laboratory-adapted\" strains, are able to infect cells directly through an interaction between the V3 region of the SU protein and CXCR4. 78, 79 Although only a few of these viruses have been tested for their capacity to replicate in vivo, those that have been inoculated into cats establish lower virus loads, and consequently are considered to be less virulent, than more \"primary\" isolates. By contrast, it is considered that the CXCR4-tropic HIVs that appear during the terminal phases of infection are somehow associated with the decline in immune responsiveness of the host, and therefore are more virulent than the primary CCR5-tropic viruses that are initially present after infection. Experience with FIV suggests that in fact the viruses that enter cells using only the coreceptor may be a product of the immunodeficiency rather than the cause. It is relevant to this review that in the cat there appears to be pressure on these CXCR4-tropic FIVs to evolve into viruses with a phenotype more like that of the primary isolates, which use both receptors. 33 Direct inoculation of a CXCR4 tropic FIV that established a very low virus load was followed, almost 3 years later, by the emergence of a virus population that appeared to have a change in receptor usage. When inoculated into kittens, these variant viruses established a higher virus load than the parental virus, similar to that following infection with a \"primary\" isolate. Consequently, there appeared to be selection pressure on the virus to evolve a phenotype that was more suited for long-term survival in its host.",

This provides the most realistic assessment of how well the vaccine performs in its intended environment. The prevalence of FIV is quite high in many populations of cats, with estimates ranging from 1-12% in the healthy pet cat population and up to 100% in small populations. This high prevalence might suggest that it would be easy to test FIV vaccines in a natural setting with relatively small numbers of cats, either under experimental conditions or in the field. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In situations of natural transmission among pet cats in the field it would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain permission from regulatory authorities to carry out the experiment; keeping pet or shelter cats in a situation in which unvaccinated individuals might be infected is not appealing.",

Group sizes need to be large, to ensure statistically meaningful results, because a portion of vaccinates is likely to remain uninfected following challenge. The experience of many is that cats housed with FIVinfected animals may remain uninfected over periods of years. However, in some cases regular, if slow, spread of infection has been recorded. 1 These potential problems ensure that testing of the majority of candidate vaccines must still be performed in experimental animals, with challenge virus being administered artificially. How can we make these experiments more realistic? Should we consider using a dose of virus that represents a more natural challenge or use multiple lower doses of virus? The hope is that vaccines that are able to prevent infection in an experimental setting with a \"robust\" challenge may be more likely to provide significant protection in pet cats in the field.",

As discussed above, there is a difference in the route of natural transmission of FIV and HIV: HIV is transmitted across mucosal surfaces, while FIV is spread mainly by biting. Consequently, FIV can serve as a model for HIV vaccination in two ways. In the first, more obvious model, which we have been describing until now, the principles established in eliciting protection from a natural challenge may be able to be applied to HIV. The second model involves manipulation of the FIV system by attempting to protect cats against virus administered by the vaginal or rectal routes, which are not the natural means of transmission of FIV but may be more relevant to HIV.",

Infection may be more readily established by rectal or vaginal routes with cell-associated virus than cell-free virus. 5 This is in agreement with the infectious doses required to infect macaques with SIV by these routes. 2, 68 Vaginal inoculation is more efficient than rectal inoculation, while oronasal administration is the least effective method of infection. 7 Clearly the route of viral challenge may influence the ability of vaccines to protect against infection or disease. While infection by the intramuscular and intraperitoneal routes requires relatively low amounts of virus for infection, mucosal infection by either the vaginal, rectal, or intranasal/oral routes requires large amounts: up to four logs higher than that required to establish infection by the intravenous or intraperitoneal routes. The implication of this difference is that HIV may similarly be more readily transmitted by intravenous drug use than by sexual transmission. What remains to be determined, although seems very likely, is whether vaccination may more readily prevent infection by mucosal compared to parenteral inoculation. The desired immune responses required to prevent infection are almost certainly different depending on the route of exposure to virus.

However, this dose is likely to be far greater than would be encountered in a natural challenge. It is possible, therefore, that vaccination trials carried out using these challenge doses may underestimate the potential efficacy of vaccines in a field setting. This contention is supported by the vaccine trial by Matteucci et al., 49 which was performed in a population of feral cats in a private shelter where FIV was endemic, with a prevalence of 29 to 58%. Animals were vaccinated with six doses of a FIV clade B paraformaldehyde-inactivated infected cell vaccine and observed for a 28-month period after the first immunisation.

Alternatively, vaccines may fail to provide any degree of protection, or worse, may actually enhance infection following challenge. Examples of each of these outcomes may be seen in Tables I-III . Many vaccines have failed to induce significant protection. This has been the outcome even when vaccination has induced significant anti-viral immune responses.

A virus that establishes a high virus load might be more difficult to protect against by vaccination, either because it grows more rapidly following infection or establishes infection in cells that are not accessible to the immune response induced by the vaccine. Another possible explanation is that the two viruses differ in antigenicity. In the CRFK-based neutralization assay, it was shown that although FIV-Pet and FIV-GL8, both of which are of clade A, were cross-neutralized by sera derived from cats infected with either virus, there was a degree of antigenic strain specificity. 52 A third possibility, mentioned previously, is that the FIV-Pet virus was more readily neutralized than FIV-GL8 by the particular antibody induced by vaccination, such that the effective dose of virus was rapidly reduced immediately following challenge.",

In an attempt to produce a vaccine containing FIV-GL8 particles with high levels of SU, a molecular clone was modified to produce a virus in which the endocytosis signal in the cytoplasmic tail of Env was mutated, thereby promoting an accumulation of virus at the infected cell surface and incorporation of SU into viral particles. 30 A vaccine derived from these particles inactivated with paraformaldehyde provided partial protection from virulent FIV-GL8 challenge. Although the formulation of the two FIV-GL8 vaccines was quite different, it may be that the significant improvement of efficacy of the second vaccine was due to better preservation of SU on the vaccine virus particles. However, the degree of protection achieved by the second vaccine against FIV-GL8 challenge was not markedly greater than that afforded by a previous vaccine based on FIV-Pet. 26 This outcome suggests that factors other than the quality of SU are necessary for protection against challenge by viruses of high virulence.",

No significant protection was recorded when the cats were challenged 12 or 28 months after vaccination, indicating that the duration of immunity was short.

They can be relatively inexpensive to produce, often do not require an adjuvant for efficacy, and produce a robust immune response. Of relevance to the development of lentivirus vaccines is the capacity of attenuated vaccines to induce both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. Viruses have traditionally been attenuated by prolonged passage in cell culture. However, the introduction of defined changes using molecular techniques offers a more refined and perhaps safer approach. The deletion of accessory lentiviral genes provides a method to reduce virulence without completely disabling virus replication and dissemination in vivo and has been extensively pursued in the SIV model. Attempts to produce a nef deleted SIV vaccine were based on the discovery that a number of individuals infected with an HIV variant deleted in nef showed slow disease progression. Although this approach showed initial promise, the eventual development of disease, both in vaccinated macaques and HIV-infected individuals, led to an obvious reluctance to pursue such vaccines for HIV. 76 A further opportunity provided by the FIV model is the availability of viruses of low virulence that can be tested for their ability to protect against subsequent challenge with a more virulent virus. The possibility that FIV-Pet, attenuated by prolonged growth in vitro, could protect against a subsequent virulent challenge has been studied. Modest protection was seen against FIV-M2 administered intravenously. 57 Excellent protection was achieved against intraperitoneal challenge with cell-free FIV-GL8 but not cell-associated vaginal challenge. 56 Although such vaccines are unlikely to be considered safe enough for clinical development, they may be able to provide a useful insight into both viral determinants of pathogenesis and immune correlates of protection.",

These have largely been unsuccessful and indeed this result reflects the great challenge that is faced in developing antigens that will induce potent, broadly reactive antibodies that can mediate protection from HIV. It is likely that to be successful such vaccines will have to comprise protective epitopes that are very similar to those in the virus. Since the majority of these are conformationally dependent, it is expected that peptide immunogens are less likely to achieve this. The use of envelope gp120 as a vaccine has met with poor success, most likely due to the lack of authentic conformation of the monomer. This outcome has been seen in the FIV system where the relatively poor efficacy of a purified gp120 vaccine was in contrast to the robust protection provided by the whole inactivated virus from which the purified preparation was derived. 27 The lack of efficacy of gp120 in animal models, however, does not appear to be a lesson that was heeded in the clinical development of an HIV vaccine, where gp120 was pursued at great cost as a prototypic HIV vaccine, as discussed above.",

            "text": "Two plausible mechanisms have been advanced to account for enhancement of FIV infection by vaccination. The first implicates antibodymediated infection of target cells, for example, by Fc or complement receptors. In experiments to evaluate several Env products as immunogens, enhancement produced in cats vaccinated with Env expressed by a vaccinia recombinant was transferable to na\u00efve cats by plasma from the vaccinated animals. 67 Definition of the regions of Env that might be responsible for this effect proved to be elusive. 35 Pancino and Sonigo 53 showed that the highly conserved structure of the principal immunogenic determinant of TM, maintained through two delineating cysteines, was essential for viral infectivity and suggested that the induction of antibodies to this region, which represent a large proportion of serum anti-FIV antibodies in infected cats, might be a mechanism that has evolved to enhance viral entry and growth. However, that the induction of antibodies specific for Env is not the only possible mechanism involved is evident from experiments in which enhancement was produced in cats immunized with vaccines that did not include Env and consequently could not elicit anti-Env antibodies; for example, a recombinant p24 (Gag) vaccine adjuvanted with immune stimulating complexes. 31 In addition, enhancement might be due to the generation of effectors other than antibodies. Thus, Richardson et al. 63 showed that a likely mechanism for increased viral growth in cats after challenge was an expansion of activated T lymphocytes, induced by vaccination with a DNA Env vaccine that did not induce anti-FIV antibodies. In a previous trial of a similar vaccine, which had resulted in enhancement, the vaccinated cats had been challenged shortly after vaccination at a time when lymphocyte activation might have been at a peak. In the second trial, in an attempt to minimize this effect, the vaccinated cats were not challenged until 10 weeks after the final vaccination. The cats immunized by the intradermal/intramuscular route did not exhibit enhanced infection after challenge. However, the appearance of virus in the blood of some cats, in which vaccine was targeted to mesenteric lymph nodes, was very much accelerated. These cats had FIV-specific helper T-cell proliferative responses and their cells were more susceptible than normal cells to infection with FIV ex vivo. Although the number of subjects in these experiments was small, the results suggest that activated FIV-specific T-cells might be more susceptible to infection than nonspecific cells, as has been demonstrated for HIV. 14 It is also possible that vaccination results in a change in the population of cells that are susceptible to infection. For example, the quantity and distribution of cells expressing receptors for FIV may be increased.",

Viral loads fell below those of controls by 8 weeks postchallenge, but the early rise suggests that wider viral dissemination and establishment of viral reservoirs may have occurred. 15 Clearly, the potential for enhancement is of great importance, not just for the use of the FIV vaccine, but also for the development of HIV vaccines.

Mucosal immunization, with either a SU V3 peptide or inactivated infected cells, adjuvanted with quil A and cholera B toxin, although inducing FIV-specific antibody and T-cell proliferation, did not protect cats from rectal challenge with the homologous virus, FIV-GL8. 19 More successful results were obtained with an inactivated FL4 cell vaccine when immunization was targeted to the iliac lymph nodes and rectal challenge was with homologous cell-free FIV-Pet. 18 It is not known whether this difference in outcome in the second trial was due to a better preserved immunogen, more effective immunization, or because of the lower virulence of the FIV-Pet challenge. Challenge with cell-associated virus proved to be un-expectedly inefficient, even in control cats vaccinated with inactivated uninfected cells, which suggested that an anticell immune response had been induced that might have protected from challenge in a non-FIVspecific fashion.",

            "text": "In this short review we have discussed some of the ways in which the development of FIV vaccines has been approached. The driving force behind many of these attempts has been to produce a vaccine that could be used in the field to prevent the spread of FIV among domestic cats. In addition it is recognized that if this end were to be achieved, the methodology might very well be applicable to the development of a vaccine against HIV in humans. So far, success has been tantalizingly close: a commercial vaccine has become available and an experimental vaccine has been shown to protect against challenge in a natural setting. Other vaccines have provided partial protection. Paradoxically, a valuable outcome of some of the trials of FIV vaccines that have failed to provide complete protection is that several confounding factors have been identified, which, by their resolution, may provide the basis for more effective vaccines in the future. For example, the commercial vaccine has been found to protect against some virus strains but not others. This result may be due to differences in virulence between the viruses used for challenge. Sufficient well-characterized FIV strains are now available to test if this is the reason. Another possibility is that there are antigenic differences between the viruses. Again, the availability of a very large number of primary FIV isolates of different clades from around the world means that the antigenic relationships between individual viruses and clades might be defined, and the practical significance of any difference might be tested directly by experimental challenge. The question of whether partial protection reduces the transmissibility of FIV can be determined by the quantification of virus in the saliva of vaccinated and challenged cats. Enhancement of infection following vaccination is a concern for the application of HIV vaccines in the field. Further definition of the factors responsible for enhancement and those that are necessary to overcome enhancement by certain FIV vaccines should be made.",

The crucial problems that have arisen in the course of FIV vaccine development will only be resolved by careful, systematic analysis of the viral and host factors responsible. We have no doubt that given more generous resources, many of these problems could be overcome, and the central tenets for the production of effective vaccines against both FIV and HIV could be established.",
