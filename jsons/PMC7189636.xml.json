            "text": "Due to the complexity of viral habitats\u2014often located within several host species\u2014and due to the various transmission routes between hosts, which can involve special environmental conditions [e.g., temperature (Handel et al. 2013)], there is no consistent mathematical framework for studying more general virus-related questions. Most of the literature studies particular infections (Murillo et al. 2013; Fraser et al. 2014) and often either focuses on between- (Fraser et al. 2007) or on within-host dynamics (Alizon et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2012; Handel et al. 2014). However, some articles follow a more general approach, e.g., combine inter- and intra-host dynamics (Coombs et al. 2007; Luciani and Alizon 2009; Pepin et al. 2010), discuss involved challenges (Handel and Rohani 2015; Gog et al. 2015; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2015), or sketch a unified perspective (Grenfell et al. 2004; Lange and Ferguson 2009; Weitz et al. 2019). Two of the last three are of particular interest here, covering the viral phylodynamics of Grenfell et al. (2004) and an epidemiological approach suggested by Lange and Ferguson (2009). As being far from obvious, one would like to know if the two approaches lead to the same conclusions.",

Therefore, our first goal aims at establishing interpretation: we want to re-identify concepts from Grenfell et al. (2004) within the framework of Lange and Ferguson (2009). In particular, we try to relate the so-called static patterns of Grenfell et al. (2004) and the infection types of Lange and Ferguson (2009). Besides mathematical structure, a crucial part of any modeling framework is the involved parameters, which we intend to compare and re-identify for the two approaches. We expect that, eventually, this will lead to a similar classification of viruses. Hereby the focus will be on virulent ones, although we do not explicitly vary virulence in our models. Furthermore, we aim to reconstruct the infection types of Lange and Ferguson (2009) by suggesting a minimal set of parameters that allows us to mathematically formulate viral lifestyles and the fitness optimization behind.",

To take this into account, we study viral replication within and between hosts. Yet, when pursuing the minimalistic approach of Lange and Ferguson (2009), we only follow one particular pathogen at a time, which\u2014determined by its temporal load\u2014spreads in the contact neighborhood of one infected individual. That is, we do not consider multiple infections and thus ignore the interaction between them (Alizon et al. 2013; Gulbudak and Weitz 2019; Clay and Rudolf 2019). This may characterize our approach as rather crude and impose implicit assumptions on the modeled system such as low incidence and a homogeneous host population. Less virulent viruses are excluded by introducing a stopping condition in the within-host model, which will restrict the follow-up period to be less than 2 years.",

(2004) suggests five so-called static patterns to characterize the net adaptation rate of a viral population with respect to the host immunity. Pathogen adaptation is understood as the fixation rate of advantageous mutations in viral epitopes. Based on a simple population genetic model, this rate is shown to increase with the strength of selection for variants that can evade immunity. However, one obtains an inverse relationship between the immune response and the viral population size so that the highest rate of adaptation occurs at an intermediate level of immunity (Fig. 1). The following patterns and RNA-viruses are identified: no effective immune response, no adaptation (HCV in immuno-compromised hosts, influenza A virus immediately after an antigenic shift);low immune pressure, low adaptation (rapidly progressing chronic HCV and HIV);medium immune pressure, high adaptation (antigenic drift in influenza A virus, intra-host HIV infections);high immune pressure, low adaptation (HIV in long-term non-progressive hosts);overwhelming immune pressure, no adaptation (measles and other morbilliviruses).The paper also discusses how these patterns and corresponding phylogenetic trees emerge based on the intra-host dynamics of the pathogen. For more detail, we refer the reader to the original literature.",

Epidemiological aspects such as transmission and inter-host environment are less important in their approach. This is different in the approach by Lange and Ferguson (2009), where infectious diseases are classified into three types (cf. Fig. 2). Even if the classification is based on antigenic variation (being either A: medium, B: high, or C: low), epidemiological aspects such as the host-contact rate and the transmission mode are revealed to be closely related. Each infection type corresponds to a certain range of contact/transmission rates (A: low, B: medium, C: high). Depending on that range, each infection type shows a distinct fitness landscape (between-host reproduction) over pathogen space (Fig. 2, top row). Most interestingly, the infection types correspond to three evolutionary strategies (Fig. 2, bottom row):1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} {\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} A\\\\ B\\\\ C \\end{array}\\right. } \\text {maximizes the}\\quad {\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text {total viral load,}\\\\ \\text {duration of infection,}\\\\ \\text {initial peak load,} \\end{array}\\right. } \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}ABCmaximizes thetotal viral load,duration of infection,initial peak load,where, to some extent, the fitness landscapes (top rows) resemble the strategic ones (bottom rows in Fig. 2).

It is crucial to employ a stopping time here, from a mathematical but also an epidemiological point of view. Namely, we are interested in modeling harmful viruses, which are present at sufficiently high loads, inducing strong immune responses and destroying significant numbers of target cells; we are not interested in learning about viruses that are tolerated by the host at low loads. In our simulations, D turned out to be shorter than 2 years. Without a load threshold, as pointed out by Viljoen et al. (2018), an unlimited duration of infection may favor only a single infection type [type B, referred to as milker-like in Viljoen et al. (2018)].",

Including a network structure is crucial. Network contacts help spreading the virus through the neighborhood and, as a consequence, effectively lower the number of susceptibles in that neighborhood. Being similar to the screening of charges in a solvent (Debye and H\u00fcckel 1923), we refer to this phenomenon as screening effect (cf. Fig. 5); in ecology the effect is also known as self-shading (Messinger and Ostling 2013). The phenomenon cannot be modeled via a modified mass-action coupling alone, yet screening seems to be necessary for obtaining type C infections [cf. Fig. 4 in Lange and Ferguson (2009)].",

Those are the proposed equilibrium and the assumed knowledge of the dynamical system. Consider dengue, for example, where one observes circulating strains and no static equilibrium. The precise dynamics is not known either (Lange 2016), and dengue is just one particular infection in a large set of infections that we would like to include. In fact, we do not know how to tackle invasion problems in such a general setting, where one would have to consider several invasions based on unknown dynamics and possibly not even at equilibrium. For now, we can only test which set of strains reproduces best in a given environment. We propose that network effects and the initial period after infection are of particular importance (Georgieva et al. 2019), leading to a classification similar to the one by Grenfell et al. (2004).
