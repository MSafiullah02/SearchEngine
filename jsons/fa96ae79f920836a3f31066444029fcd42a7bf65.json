To date, four studies have been performed in patients with severe CAP [12] [13] [14] [15] . A meta-analysis published by Nie et al. [16] showed that in a subgroup of patients with severe CAP, steroids reduced mortality. More recently, a meta-analysis [17] showed that the use of systemic corticosteroids in CAP was associated with a moderate reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation, development of ARDS and, with high certainty, a reduction in time to clinical stability and duration of hospitalization. This study also showed a possible reduction in mortality, but this effect was seen mainly in the subgroup of patients with severe pneumonia.",

To date, this latter variable has not been taken into account in the any of the RCTs. CAP patients with a marked inflammatory response have high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), higher rates of treatment failure [18] and worse mortality rates [19] . Furthermore, there are marked differences in variables in the majority of RCTs, regardless of dosages, type and length of steroid treatment, which makes it very difficult to compare results. The primary end-points are different between studies, and some of them, such as length of stay or even time to clinical stability, are 'soft' endpoints: length of stay depends on other variables and clinical stability is driven by the persistence of fever which is, in fact, down-regulated by corticosteroids.",

Mortality did not differ significantly between groups, but the study was not designed to find differences in mortality (10% in the methylprednisolone arm vs. 15% in the placebo arm, p = 0.37). The reduction in treatment failure was more evident in late treatment failure (3% vs. 25%, p = 0.001), and especially in radiographic progression, which was one of the variables included in the composite definition of late treatment failure (2% vs. 15%, p = 0.007).

It is important to select patients with severe CAP with a marked inflammatory response measured by CRP. Another important point is to exclude patients with influenza pneumonia, as growing evidence suggests that corticosteroids increase mortality in patients with influenza pneumonia [23] . Little information is available on the possible effect of corticosteroids on other viral pneumonias caused by adenovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, or others. However, high serum levels of CRP indicate that pure viral pneumonia is unlikely. We propose an algorithm for the administration of corticosteroids as an adjunctive treatment for CAP (Fig. 1) .",
