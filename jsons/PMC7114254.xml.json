Alternatively, a frailty model Vaupel et al., 1979, Andersen et al., 1999 postulates that the hazard within a particular cluster is the product of a function of the covariates and a cluster-specific parameter known as the \u201cfrailty\u201d. The frailty commonly is used to indicate unobserved (i.e. \u201clatent\u201d) cluster-specific variables. Furthermore, independence among observed data items is assumed conditional on the frailty.",

The new variance estimator is similar to the sandwich estimator (Binder, 1983). The regression coefficient, which remains the same as in the naive (i.e. without correlation taken into account) model, is interpreted as a \u201cpopulation-average\u201d coefficient. Interpretation of the parameters is obtained by considering the risk factors associated with the sample herds; consequences of a possible intra-herd correlation are taken into account.

Hazards were higher when cows were not vaccinated (against a variety of specific agents), calvings needed assistance, cows were not clean, the building smelled of ammonia, and calf-diarrhoea incidence was >5% the previous year. However, we recommend use of the FCM if statistical inference is an intention.",
