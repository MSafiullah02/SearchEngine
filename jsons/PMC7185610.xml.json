            "text": "Antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) are essential for initiating immune responses because of their unique ability to stimulate naive T lymphocytes (1). However, DCs are heterogeneous in both their ontogeny and function (2). In mouse spleen, there exist three major populations of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs): CD4+CD8\u2212 (CD4+ DC), CD4\u2212CD8\u2212 (double negative [DN] DC) and CD4\u2212CD8+ DC (CD8+ DC) (3). While there is debate over the haematological origins of these populations (4\u20136), they are functionally distinct. For example, CD8+ DCs are relatively poor stimulators of T cells (7, 8), and were originally proposed to have a regulatory function (9). However, if activated, CD8+ and CD8\u2212 DCs can both induce immune responses (10, 11), though they preferentially induce Th1 and Th2 type responses, respectively (12, 13). This is in part due to CD8+ DCs being more potent producers of IL-12 (14, 15). CD8+ DCs have a unique ability to take-up dying cells (16), and are especially adept at cross-presenting exogenous antigen on class I MHC (17, 18). Lymph node CD8+ DCs are the most efficient at presenting viral antigen and initiating T cell responses (19). Finally, DC populations occupy different micro-environments in lymphoid organs (15, 20), CD8+ DCs tend to concentrate in T cell areas, whereas CD8\u2212 DCs are found in marginal zones but migrate to T cell areas upon stimulation (21).",

The CIRE protein sequence shows a 57% identity with the human molecule DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-grabbing non-integrin (hDC-SIGN) (26, 27). Human DC-SIGN facilitates interactions with T cells by binding ICAM-3, and with endothelial cells by binding ICAM-2 (28, 29). It also plays a role in the capture, internalisation and presentation of foreign antigen (30). Notably, several pathogens interact with hDC-SIGN, including viruses such as HIV, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Ebolavirus (EBOV), bacteria such as Mycobacterium and parasites such as Leishmania and the eggs of Schistosoma mansoni (31).",

In humans, there is a DC-SIGN homologue (DC-SIGNR or L-SIGN), which is just as similar to CIRE/mDC-SIGN as is hDC-SIGN (32).

Low-density cells were enriched by density centrifugation. Non-DC-lineage cells were coated with mAb (KT3-1.1, T24/31.7, TER119, RB6-8C5, ID3) and then removed using immunomagnetic beads. Coating with RB6-8C5 mAb (anti-Gr-1) did not result in the depletion of plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells (pDCs) (33).

Due to the low level and frequency of CIRE/mDC-SIGN expression on DCs, the CD11c+CIRE/mDC-SIGN\u2212 DC purity was above 98%, but the CD11c+CIRE/mDC-SIGN+ DC purity was only 50\u201375%, the main contaminants being CD11c+CIRE/mDC-SIGN\u2212 DCs. To obtain blood mononuclear cells, mice were bled by cardiac puncture into tubes containing heparinized buffered saline solution. Mononuclear cells were isolated by density centrifugation using Histopaque 1.083 (Sigma, Castle Hill, Australia) and cells bearing CD3, Thy-1, Gr-1 and the erythrocyte marker TER119 removed by immunomagnetic bead depletion. Cells from the peritoneal cavity or the bone marrow were obtained by flushing with medium, and then removing erythrocytes with lysis buffer (0.099 mM EDTA disodium, 0.145 M NH4Cl, 0.012 M NaHCO3).",

Briefly, CIRE/mDC-SIGN cDNA was amplified from previously isolated clones (26) using the PCR and Pwo polymerase (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) under standard amplification conditions: 25 cycles: 94\u00b0, 30 s; 55\u00b0, 30 s; 72\u00b0, 1 min. The primers used in this reaction were: CIRE/mDC-SIGN-For primer 5\u2032-TAG TAG ATA TCG GCG CGC CTC ACT TGC TAG GGC AGG A and -Rev primer 5\u2032-TAG TAG ATA TCG GCG CGC CTG AAA CAT GAG TGA TTC TAA G. Similarly, hDC-SIGN was amplified from cDNA derived from human DCs, using primers designed from published sequences (34): hDC-SIGN-For primer 5\u2032-TAG TAG ATA TCT GGG GTG ACA TGA GTG AC and DC-SIGN-Rev primer 5\u2032-TAG TAG ATA TCT ACG CAG GAG GGG GGT TT. The CIRE/mDC-SIGN/hDC-SIGN hybrid molecules were generated using an overlapping PCR strategy. To generate CIRE/mDC-SIGN/h-CTLD, cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domains, transmembrane domain and hinge region of CIRE/mDC-SIGN was amplified by PCR using the CIRE/mDC-SIGN-For primer, plus the CIRE/mDC-SIGN/hCTLD-Rev primer 5\u2032-TGT CCA TTC CCA GGG ACA GGA GCG GCA CAG TCG AT. The first 17 nt of this primer correspond to sequence encoding the C-terminus of the CIRE/mDC-SIGN hinge region, whereas the last 17 nt encode the N-terminus of the hDC-SIGN CTLD. Similarly, cDNA corresponding to the hDC-SIGN CTLD was amplified with the hDC-SIGN-Rev primer and the CIRE/mDC-SIGN/hCTLD-For primer ATC GAC TGT GCC GCT CCT GTC CCT GGG AAT GGA CA, whose sequence is the reverse and complement of the CIRE/mDC-SIGN/hCTLD-Rev primer. The cDNAs encoding the CIRE/mDC-SIGN cytoplasmic, transmembrane and hinge regions and the DC-SIGN CTLD were purified by conventional methods, and joined by PCR using the CIRE/mDC-SIGN-For and hDC-SIGN-Rev primers. The resulting cDNA was then cloned into the EcoRV site of pIRES-Neo. A parallel strategy was used to generate the hDC-SIGN/mCTLD hybrid. Here cDNA encoding the hDC-SIGN cytoplasmic, transmembrane and hinge regions was amplified using the hDC-SIGN-For primer and the DC-SIGN/mCTLD-Rev primer 5\u2032-CGT CCA GTC CCA GGG GCA GGG GTG GCA CAG GCG TT. Similarly, cDNA encoding the mouse CIRE/mDC-SIGN CTLD was amplified using the CIRE/mDC-SIGN-Rev primer and primer whose sequence was the reverse and complement of DC-SIGN/mCTLD-Rev, namely DC-SIGN/mCTLD-For primer 5\u2032-AAC GCC TGT GCC ACC CCT GCC CCT GGG ACT GGA CG. Again, the two resulting cDNA fragments were joined in an overlapping PCR using the hDC-SIGN-For and CIRE/mDC-SIGN-Rev primers.

A new mAb (5H10) we raised against CIRE/mDC-SIGN recognised both CIRE/mDC-SIGN and FLAG-CIRE/mDC-SIGN, but not the neo-control transfectant (Fig. 1A). It is theoretically possible that this anti-CIRE/mDC-SIGN mAb cross-reacted with the mouse DC-SIGN siblings (SIGNR1-4), despite the fact that the immunogenic peptide selected was chosen from a region of genetic variability. Since mAb 5H10 reacted with splenocytes (see below) and only mouse SIGNR1 is expressed in the spleen and on macrophages (27, 44\u201347), we determined whether this mAb cross-reacted with mouse SIGNR1. SIGNR1 expression was detected with an antibody against the antigenic AU1 tag, but not by mAb 5H10, indicating that 5H10 does not recognise mouse SIGNR1 (Fig. 1B).",

However, when freshly isolated DCs from SPF mice were incubated with various concentrations of IL-4 or IL-13, there was no up-regulation of CIRE/mDC-SIGN (Fig. 2B).

To establish whether CIRE/mDC-SIGN had a mannose-binding specificity, CHO cells expressing FLAG-CIRE/mDC-SIGN, CIRE/mDC-SIGN, mouse SIGNR1 or the neomycin resistance gene alone were incubated with mannosylated FITC-conjugated BSA. FLAG-CIRE/mDC-SIGN and CIRE/mDC-SIGN CHO cells clearly bound mannosylated FITC-conjugated BSA (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, this binding was inhibited by mannan (Fig. 3A) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B), and by EDTA (Fig. 3A and B), showing that CIRE/mDC-SIGN, like hDC-SIGN, bound ligands in a mannose-specific and Ca2+-dependent fashion. However, binding of the mannosylated FITC-conjugated BSA was not inhibited by the mAb 5H10, indicating this mAb does not neutralise the CIRE/mDC-SIGN lectin-binding site (data not shown). Interestingly, while CIRE/mDC-SIGN bounds \u03b1-D-mannosylated FITC-conjugated BSA, FITC\u2013ovalbumin peptide containing mainly (Man)nGlcNAcGlcNAc-Asn failed to bind CIRE/mDC-SIGN (50). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear but may reflect difference in the substrate (type or level of mannosylation).

However, it is obvious from the use of identical reagents that the levels of CIRE/mDC-SIGN on the cell surface of the transfected CHO cells were significantly higher than ever seen on the surface of native DC (data not shown and Fig. 1A and C). Surprisingly, CHO cells expressing CIRE/mDC-SIGN did not bind HIV-1, EBOV-GP-bearing pseudotypes, HCMV, MCMV or Leishmania (Fig. 5), indicating that DCs expressing CIRE/mDC-SIGN should also lack this capacity.

This assay only gave a maximum of 15% of cells showing parasite attachment. However, it was clear that the only cells binding the organisms were those expressing the hDC-SIGN lectin domain (i.e. CHO cells expressing hDC-SIGN and those expressing the chimeric molecule containing the lectin domain of hDC-SIGN and the stalk of CIRE/mDC-SIGN) (Fig. 5C). These results indicated that the hDC-SIGN lectin was the only essential domain for this interaction. An additional point of interest was that neither promastigotes nor amastigotes of L. major were able to bind to hDC-SIGN, indicating a potentially important host and parasite specificity for this host\u2013pathogen interaction (data not shown).",

In accordance with this, EBOV-GP-driven infection of CHO cells expressing hDC-SIGN was at least two logs above control cells (Fig. 5D). Pre-incubation with mannan strongly reduced EBOV-GP-driven infection of DC-SIGN-expressing cells but not of control cells, indicating that the enhancement of infection was mannose specific and, thus, indicative of hDC-SIGN engagement (data not shown). In contrast, stable expression of CIRE/mDC-SIGN by CHO cells did not enhance infection and this defect could not be rescued by the introduction of the hDC-SIGN stalk (Fig. 5F). Moreover, the hDC-SIGN chimera containing the CIRE/mDC-SIGN stalk also failed to enhance infection. The results with HIV-1 and HCMV were comparable to those obtained with EBOV-GP-bearing pseudotypes. Thus, HCMV bound to CHO cells expressing hDC-SIGN but no specific binding was observed with cells expressing CIRE/mDC-SIGN or chimeric lectins (Fig. 5F). Similarly, only hDC-SIGN-expressing cells transmitted a replication competent HIV-1 reporter virus to permissive cells with appreciable efficiency and in a mannan-sensitive manner, while transmission by cells positive for CIRE/mDC-SIGN or chimeric lectins was inefficient (Fig. 5E and data not shown).

Proteins in the cell lysate of parental CHO-KI cells that do not express mouse or human DC-SIGN are not detected with the anti-CIRE/mDC-SIGN and anti-human DC-SIGN mAb (Fig. 6; lane 1). DC-SIGN is a 46-kDa protein containing one N-linked glycosylation site, which is utilised (38). In accordance with this, under reducing conditions, the predominant product of DC-SIGN (lane 2) resolved at 46 kDa with a minor product detected at \u223c44 kDa (presumed to be non-glycosylated protein). In contrast, under non-reducing conditions, an additional DC-SIGN (lane 2) product was detected at \u223c180 kDa, corresponding to the expected tetramer (184 kDa). The chimeric protein of CIRE/mDC-SIGN lectin fused to hDC-SIGN stalk is expected to be 44 kDa (lane 3) and, accordingly, under reducing conditions a band of 44 kDa was detected. Interestingly, under non-reducing conditions, the predominant product runs at \u223c180 kDa, the expected size (176 kDa) of the tertramerised protein, and only a minor monomeric product is detected at 44 kDa. The second chimera (hDC-SIGN lectin fused to CIRE/mDC-SIGN stalk) was expected to be 29 kDa and under reducing conditions a band is indeed detected at 29 kDa (lane 4). However, regardless of whether the cell lysates were run under reducing or non-reducing conditions, no multimer was detected, consistent with the notion that the CIRE/mDC-SIGN stalk fails to allow multimerisation. In accordance with this, CIRE/mDC-SIGN (27 kDa) failed to multimerise, since an oligomerisation product of CIRE/mDC-SIGN was not detected under non-reducing or reducing conditions.",

Complicating this proposition is the fact that in the mouse there are at least five closely related C-type lectins (CIRE/mDC-SIGN, mSIGNR1\u20144), all sharing comparable amino acid identity with the two human C-type lectins, hDC-SIGN and hDC-SIGNR (26, 27). However, since like human DC-SIGN, CIRE/mDC-SIGN is the only mouse DC-SIGN gene that is closely juxtaposed to the CD23 gene, and is the only mouse lectin expressed in DCs, it was concluded to be the hDC-SIGN orthologue. In this report, using a mAb against mouse CIRE/mDC-SIGN, we show that its expression pattern has some similarity to that of hDC-SIGN. Mouse CIRE/mDC-SIGN is expressed on freshly isolated splenic, thymic and lymph node DCs; unfortunately, these tissue sources have not been used for isolation of human DCs. However, CIRE/mDC-SIGN can be detected on monocyte-derived DCs (data not shown) and macrophages and hDC-SIGN is expressed on monocyte-derived DCs, monocyte-derived Langerhans cells, CD1alo dermal DCs and macrophage subsets (28, 49, 55\u201357). In the mouse, CIRE/mDC-SIGN is also on the cell surface of spleen pDCs; notably, there are reports of its expression on human pDCs, but the data are conflicting (49, 55). Interestingly, mouse blood monocytes express CIRE/mDC-SIGN, whereas human monocytes do not express DC-SIGN (28, 55, 56). There maybe some parallels between the down-regulation of CIRE/mDC-SIGN on freshly isolated mouse DCs when activated with CpG (Fig. 2) LPS, IFN-\u03b3 and poly-IC (data not shown) and the reduction observed when human monocyte-derived DCs are \u2018matured\u2019 with factors such as LPS, prostaglandin E2 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (28, 55). However, there are clearly differences in gene regulation in response to IL-4 and IL-13. Freshly isolated mouse DCs do not up-regulate CIRE/mDC-SIGN in the presence of IL-4 and IL-13, whereas hDC-SIGN, on monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages, is up-regulated in the presence of IL-4 and IL-13 (48, 49). It remains to be seen whether this is a difference between the different types of DCs studied, or whether it is a species difference between mouse and man.",

The key issue to be addressed was whether CIRE/mDC-SIGN is indeed a functional orthologue of hDC-SIGN. Human DC-SIGN binds ICAM-3 and has been proposed to help initiate interactions between DCs and T cells (28), though this observation has been challenged recently (57). In an allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction, both CIRE/mDC-SIGN+ DCs and CIRE/mDC-SIGN\u2212 DCs induced comparable levels of T cell proliferation, arguing that this lectin in the mouse plays, at best, only a minor role in T cell activation and aligns our finding with that of Granelli-Piperno et al. (57). Another role proposed for hDC-SIGN is antigen capture and presentation (30, 31). A similar function has been proposed for CIRE/mDC-SIGN (50) and more directly shown for the homologue mSIGNR1, a C-type lectin expressed in marginal zone macrophages, which takes up blood-borne polysaccharide antigens (44\u201347). Our data showing that CIRE/mDC-SIGN binds mannosylated FITC\u2013BSA in a calcium-dependent manner (Fig. 3) demonstrates that this molecule is also a C-type lectin with mannose-binding specificity. However, despite the common mannose-binding function, and despite the fact that CIRE/mDC-SIGN transfectants expressed significantly higher levels of CIRE/mDC-SIGN than physiologically found on mouse DCs, they did not interact appreciably with HIV-1, virion-associated EBOV-GP, HCMV or L. mexicana, pathogens that have been documented to interact with hDC-SIGN (34, 37, 39, 51\u201353).",

            "text": "In order to reconcile this discrepancy, we focused on the region that differs most significantly between the human and mouse molecule, namely the stalk region that supports the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). In hDC-SIGN, the stalk has seven and a half tandem repeats that give rise to an alpha helix, which is involved in the tetramerisation of the CRD (54). The oligomerisation caused by the stalk has two functions. The first function is to create a unique spatial arrangement between the individual CRDs and thus contribute to their ligand specificity. In the case of hDC-SIGN, it has been shown that this lectin specifically interacts with the trimannose motif in high mannose oligosaccharides and that these carbohydrates need to be spaced some distance apart to interact with multiple CRDs (53, 54, 58\u201360). This differs from the mannose-binding receptor, which binds terminal mannose residues (54). The second function of oligomerisation is to facilitate multivalent interaction and thus enhance avidity (54, 61). In the mouse, CIRE/mDC-SIGN does not have the tandem repeats or motifs that allow tetramer formation and we reasoned that this deficiency could contribute to its inability to bind the pathogens that hDC-SIGN bound. However, when the N-terminus of hDC-SIGN was fused to the mouse CIRE/mDC-SIGN CRD, the chimeric molecule failed to bind the pathogens tested despite having the capacity to multimerise (Fig. 6), arguing that the mouse CRD, even when endowed with the oligomerisation domain, is unable to recognise the same ligands as hDC-SIGN. When the hDC-SIGN CRD was fused to the CIRE/mDC-SIGN stalk, and thus lost its capacity to oligomerise (Fig. 6), it could no longer bind HIV-1, HCMV or EBOV-GP-bearing pseudotypes, suggesting that multivalent engagement is indeed required for binding. Indeed, the requirement for multimerisation of hDC-SIGN for the binding of HIV-1 envelope protein has been previously reported (62). Thus, for the binding of viruses, CIRE/mDC-SIGN differs from its human orthologue with respect to the function of the both CRD and the stalk region. Interestingly, the chimeric molecule containing the human DC-SIGN lectin fused to the CIRE/mDC-SIGN stalk, could still bind L. mexicana promastigotes, indicating that this interaction is independent of the tetramerisation of hDC-SIGN.",

            "text": "To conclude, it is clear that CIRE/mDC-SIGN and hDC-SIGN are highly related molecules. They share highly significant identity at the amino acid level, and both CTLDs do have the capacity to bind mannosylated molecules. Their pattern of expression is similar with both molecules expressed predominantly on DCs and other myeloid cells. Moreover, their evolutionary relatedness is evidenced by their chromosomal location, with both genes being tightly linked to CD23, in the mouse and human genomes. However, we consistently failed to demonstrate binding of mouse CIRE/mDC-SIGN to any of the hDC-SIGN ligands tested. Supporting our observation, CIRE/mDC-SIGN failed to bind Candida albicans and Escherichia coli (50), whereas hDC-SIGN has been shown to bind these pathogens (63, 64). Furthermore, even among the closely related CIRE/mDC-SIGN and mouse SIGNR1-4 lectins, there are distinct recognition patterns for microbes despite the conserved EPN (mannose recognition) motif (50). Thus, the CTLDs of hDC-SIGN and CIRE/mDC-SIGN, although endowed with similar carbohydrate specificities, differ in their abilities to interact with pathogens, suggesting that the fine specificity of the CTLDs of hDC-SIGN and CIRE/mDC-SIGN are significantly different and that they may not be simple functional orthologues. The question whether there are other yet to be defined, functional similarities between these two molecules will only be resolved by the identification of CIRE/mDC-SIGN-specific ligands.",
