An outbreak of a life-threatening disease referred to as SARS has spread to many countries around the world. By late June 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded more than 8400 cases of SARS and more than 800 SARSrelated deaths, and a global alert for the illness was issued due to the severity of the disease [25] . A growing body of evidence has convincingly shown that SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus, called SARS-coronavirus or SARS-CoV [14, 19] . A novel SARS associated with coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been implicated as the causative agent of a worldwide outbreak of SARS during the first 6 months of 2003 [16, 24] . Currently, the complete genome sequences of 11 strains of SARS-CoV isolated from some SARS patients have been sequenced, and more complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV are expected to come [13] . It is also known that the process of cleaving the SARS-CoV polyproteins by a special proteinase, the so-called SARS coronavirus main proteinase (CoV Mpro), is a key step for the replication of SARS-CoV [18] . The importance of the 3CL proteinase cleavage sites not only suggests that this proteinase is a culprit of SARS, but also makes it an attractive target for developing drugs directly against the new disease [3, 10, 23] .",

Even though neural network model has been successfully used for the analysis [1, 7] , one of the major weakness of the neural network is its lack of explanation capability. It is hidden in a black box and can be used to predict, but not to explain domain knowledge in explicit format. In recent years, there have been studies on rule extraction from feed-forward neural networks [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 21, 22] . The extracted rules provide human users with the capability to explain how the patterns are classified and may provide better insights about the domain.

In this paper, we extract If-Then rules from the neural networks and then compare the generated rules to the consensus patterns.

The data set includes 8 regions (i.e., 8 positions of P4, P3, P2, P1, P1', P2', P3', P4') and one class attribute. Each region represents one of the 20 amino acids and the class attribute tells if the instance with 8 region values belongs to either cleavage (i.e., 1) or non-cleavage (i.e., 0). Each region value that is one of 20 amino acids is converted into 20 binary values in which only one of them is 1 and the rests are 0s. This binary encoding is illustrated in table 1. Thus, we have 160 (i.e., 8 * 20) binary input nodes and one output node for our neural network architecture. From each sequence of coronavirus genome, eleven cleavage sites are included and thus, total 264 (= 24 * 11) sites are available. We eliminated duplicated ones out of the total 264 results and identified final seventy cleavage sites. For training a neural network classifier, negative examples (presumed non-cleavage sites) are created by defining all other glutamines in the viral polyproteins as non-cleavable sites [11]. Therefore, the data set include 70 positive (i.e., cleavage) and 281 negative (i.e., non-cleavage) examples. Threefold cross-validation were used for classifier evaluation. That is, every test set contains 117 examples of which 23 or 24 were positive examples.",

Thus, we created negative examples with 'Q' at position p1 for fair comparison. Then the consensus patterns we use are 'L.', 'L.[S/A]' and '[T/S/A]X[L/F].[S/A/G]' and they are converted into the form of rules in table 3. The '.' represents the position p1.
