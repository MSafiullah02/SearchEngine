If we measure virulence (damage to host) only by the crude measure of host mortality, the scale of importance is made plain. Globally, parasites (defined broadly as infectious agents of disease) are responsible for 19% of all human mortality (World Health Organization 2004). In recent decades, the burden of infectious diseases has even increased in many countries because of the emergence of new pathogens and the re\u2010emergence of old pathogens newly resistant to current methods of control (Woolhouse & Gowtage\u2010Sequeria 2005). The picture was not always so bleak. The development and widespread use of new vaccines and antibiotics in the 1950s and 1960s led to an unprecedented decline in numerous deadly parasites and pathogens in developed countries, with one infectious disease, smallpox, even driven to extinction. As a measure of this historic success, in 1969 the US Surgeon General was able to declare that the war against pestilence had been won (Fig. 1, Anker & Schaaf 2002).",

More generally, a great deal of theoretical attention has been paid to the question of how much harm a parasite should impose on its host, as a function of the parasite's ecology (shaped in part by biomedical interventions). Parasite\u2010induced harm to the host, or virulence (Ebert & Hamilton 1996; Poulin & Combes 1999) is commonly assumed to be an inevitable side\u2010effect of exploitation and transmission to another host, presenting the parasite with the challenge of balancing a trade\u2010off between increasing transmission and rising virulence (Anderson & May 1982; Dieckmann et al. 2002; but see Ebert & Bull 2003 for an alternative view). The evolutionary study of virulence is currently attracting increasing interest, undoubtedly because of its strong implications for many areas, including human public health strategy and conservation biology. Understanding parasite evolution is thus not just an academic pursuit; it offers a conceptual framework to professionals in many fields and should contribute to decision\u2010making.",

Parasites evolve but the exact contribution of human activities to this phenomenon remains an open question to which there is no simple answer at the moment. It is well established that human activities, especially in the past century, have resulted in substantial large\u2010scale habitat and climate modifications. It is also widely recognized that such phenomena have major, sometimes dramatic, effects on the ecology and the evolution of living organisms. However, compared to the huge effort that researchers have devoted to explore the consequences of these changes on the ecology and/or on the evolution of free\u2010living organisms, considerably less attention has been paid to parasitic organisms. In addition to altering global ecology, technology and human population growth also affect the evolutionary trajectories of disease organisms in many ways (Palumbi 2001), although the direction and magnitude of these effects remain difficult to predict (Altizer et al. 2003). However, at this stage, speculation has proven more attractive than data collection, and as a consequence, predictions remain at best simplistic, and at worst misleading. We review here some of the current evidence of the interactions between human activities and parasite evolution and explore avenues for further research.",

Humans have suffered from multiple infectious diseases for millions of years from their origin to the present. It is well established that the range of diseases humans have been exposed to has changed considerably from early human populations nearly 4 millions years ago to Neolithic humans that lived on Earth c.a. 10 000\u20138000 years ago, and thereafter to modern humans living today in megalopolises (Armelagos et al. 1996). For instance, the habitat of early hominids was probably restricted to the tropical savannah. Then, during the course of human evolution, the habitat expanded gradually into the more temperate zones. Hominids thus transported some other diseases en route with the human expansion, and acquired new pathogen agents living in the newly colonized territories (Gu\u00e9gan et al. 2007). Traditional human populations lived in small, sparsely settled communities, where population sizes and densities remained very low. Human communities were too small to support endemic pathogens, but they were infected by various zoonoses (e.g. sleeping sickness, avian tuberculosis and leptospirosis) (Armelagos et al. 1996). With the agricultural revolution about 10 000 years ago, increasing sedentarity and larger population groupings resulted in an increase in the diversity and severity of infectious diseases such as influenza, measles, mumps, or smallpox (Armelagos et al. 1996). The domestication of animals also provided a supply of vectors and greater exposure to zoonotic diseases (Polgar 1964). Human populations have constantly moved, transformed habitats, and created new ways of living and eating, thus generating new pathways for diseases to invade and spread into communities.",

The evolution of resistance to drugs is probably the best\u2010known example that humans can directly drive the evolution of parasites. Resistance is a near inevitable consequence of the use of antiparasitic drugs (Palumbi 2001). The most commonplace example is the rapid acquisition of resistance to antibiotics in bacteria (Baquero & Blasquez 1997), further documented indirectly by geographical correlations between levels of antibiotic prescription and resistance (Goossens et al. 2005). Similar examples also abound in livestock hosts. The routine use of anthelmintics against parasites of sheep and cattle has imposed new pressures on adult helminths for many parasite generations. Resistance to some anthelmintics has evolved quickly (Sangster 1999), but these have been replaced by other types of drugs so that the increased adult parasite mortality is maintained. We may thus expect other adaptive changes in parasite populations that have been exposed to anthelmintics for several years (see Buckling et al. 1997; Skorping & Read 1998; Leignel & Cabaret 2001; Poulin 2007). For instance, if adult parasite lifespan decreases, it is predicted that selection should favour a shorter prepatent period, that is an earlier age at maturity. Such a process then allows the parasite to produce eggs before the host is given anthelmintics (Poulin 2007).",

We expect that pathogens produced in these ecosystems, many of which may be drug resistant, will spill out to attack other age groups of the population (i.e. infants, toddlers and children). Modern humans live longer, at least in industrialized countries, where the number of elderly is rapidly increasing (Morris & Potter 1997).

It follows that infection networks may also show \u2018small world\u2019 connections in modern societies. In agreement with this, it is interesting to note that the same pathogen genotype has often been isolated from two distant regions of the world, worldwide dissemination being attributable either to a single clone as for leprosy (Monot et al. 2005), or to some geographically ubiquitous strains as in measles (Riddell et al. 2005). The rapid and seasonal spread of a predominant influenza subtype among human populations is the best evidence of worldwide dissemination of the disease, because of increasing human contact networks (Brownstein et al. 2006; Nelson & Holmes 2007). Similarly, although still controversial, the most likely explanation for the recent and rapid spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus throughout the world is human activity (Gauthier\u2010Clerc et al. 2007).",

As a result of changing patterns of contact due in particular to innovations in transportation, one can argue that we have shifted from a regular lattice (characterized by local interactions only) to increasingly \u2018small world\u2019 networks (Renaud et al. 2005). Watts & Strogatz (1998) suggested that infectious diseases spread more easily in small\u2010world networks than in \u2018regular\u2019 lattices, therefore changing contact patterns would have strong consequences for pathogen dispersal (Ferrari et al. 2006; Meyers 2006) and consequently for the evolution of virulence and resistance. Changing contact patterns would likewise impact the movement of all categories of vectors that are responsible for pathogen transport. Planes and boats constitute new opportunities for vector and pathogen dispersal (Renaud et al. 2005). Even if there are likely to be many cases where diseases failed to emerge from contact with a disease\u2010bearing organism, transcontinental travel and pet transport will increase in the future. In this context, we need to be increasingly aware of the implications of the international exotic pet trade, which may be an efficient pathway for disseminating those infectious diseases around the globe (Di Giulio & Eckburg 2004).",

Fungi from the same geographical area often exhibit strong genetic barriers (sexual or asexual) to interspecific hybridization. These barriers probably maintain gene combinations conferring optimal adaptation to the local ecological niche, and also prevent the spread of harmful genetic elements, such as viruses, between species (Brasier 2000). However, such barriers might not exist, or might be weaker, between fungi that have remained geographically isolated. There is thus a greater possibility of hybridization when fungi spread beyond their normal geographical ranges. Human influences have increased the chances of such occurrences. Immigration of fungal pathogens into new areas is likely to bring them into contact with resident, related species, especially those with a similar host or vector type. Although the potential for hybridization between residents and immigrants depends on several factors, it happens sometimes. Possible outcomes range from the acquisition of a single gene by one parent to a full species hybrid incorporating the genomes of both parents (Brasier 1995). The evolutionary potential of a population is proportional to its level of phenotypic, as well as genotypic, variation. It is now apparent that hybridization between fungal pathogens can produce a devastating array of phenotypes.",

Hospitals are the source of many diseases because patients are often immunocompromised, and because infected people converge on hospitals. The majority of nosocomial infections have an endemic origin (i.e. inside the hospital), where infection comes from a microorganism present in the ecosystem, with surgical or other medical intervention rendering it infectious.

Finally, it is important to recognize the tremendous successes (and ongoing challenge in the developing world) of diverse public health measures such as the introduction of clean chlorinated water and vaccines in driving the reduction and even eradication of many infectious diseases (Fig. 1, Armstrong et al. 1999). However, although vaccination generally prevents successful pathogen transmission, imperfect or \u2018leaky\u2019 vaccines can also have unplanned consequences: if used repeatedly, they can select for higher levels of virulence (Gandon et al. 2001; Gandon et al. 2003; Andr\u00e9 & Gandon 2006). More generally, vaccination can influence the evolution of pathogens through various phenomena, both long\u2010term and short\u2010term ones. Because of the protection conferred by vaccine, hosts die less, thereby relieving the parasite of the potential fitness costs of prematurely shortened infections. Thus, host populations with high levels of immunity can maintain more virulent pathogens than na\u00efve host populations can (Gandon et al. 2001). Vaccine\u2010acquired host immunity may also result in lower parasite loads that reduce resource competition among parasites inside the host, but increase the competition for enemy\u2010free space (e.g. by immune evasion). As pointed out by Mackinnon & Read (2004), this could lead to more aggressive parasites racing to stay ahead of proliferating immune responses. Along the same idea, it could also lead to the evolution of novel antigenic variants that have a selective advantage only in immunized hosts.",

Protected areas often encompass a very small portion of the total surface area potentially suitable (Dompka 1996). In addition, even when they appear relatively large in terms of surface area, the true optimal size of protected areas remains a relative parameter as it mainly depends on the number/type of species present. The overcrowding of animals in reserves is a topic that currently attracts increasing attention among conservationists. Such a phenomenon may indeed create foci for the production and maintenance of virulent parasites, which can potentially spill out to attack hosts from other areas or other species (Lebarbenchon et al. 2006). The likelihood and impact of an epidemic increases with host density because density determines contact rates between infected and uninfected individuals. Infectious agents require a threshold host density for transmission. Reducing the spatial extent of available habitat is indeed likely to select for virulent strains and trigger disease outbreaks by pushing parasites and hosts closer together. In extreme cases, this type of phenomenon favours the emergence of new diseases since increased interspecific contacts, and/or the elimination of the preferred host species, may then result in parasites jumping species. Because of the stress resulting from overcrowding, individuals may be in poor conditions and may provide \u2018stepping stones\u2019 for the evolution of pathogens. Humanity continuously encounters new pathogens of animal origin because anthropogenic changes often increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population and to generate subsequent human\u2010to\u2010human transmission (Antia et al. 2003). The past decade has even seen the emergence and resurgence of many infectious diseases around the world with the majority of them being zoonoses (Gu\u00e9gan et al. 2007). HIV, Ebola and new hanta viruses in humans are believed to have arisen through that route. The independent emergence of two Human Immunodeficiency Virus strains, that is HIV\u20101 and HIV\u20102, from two distinct Simian Immunodeficiency Virus progenitors in two widely separated geographical areas, from the chimpanzee in Central Africa for HIV\u20101 (Keele et al. 2006) and from the sooty mangabey in West Africa for HIV\u20102 (Santiago et al. 2005), is just an illustration of the huge diversity of locally adapted microbial forms in wildlife that can transfer to humans. The Ebola virus was discovered to originate from bats (Leroy et al. 2005). The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) provoked by an RNA virus, a coronavirus, was identified as coming from Palm civets Paguma larvata living in the Himalayas and feeding in China (Guan et al. 2003). Similarly, Arena and Hantaan viruses causing haemorrhagic fevers in humans are common in wild rodent species all over the world. The expansion and the encroachment of humans into new environments still increase the probability of contact with new parasites.",

The pathogen's reproductive number corresponds to the average number of new infections resulting from the introduction of one infected individual in a population of susceptible hosts. There are a number of ways in which R\n0 can increase, some of which are under human influence. Ecological changes such as changes in host density or behaviour can increase R\n0, as can genetic changes in the pathogen population or in the population of its new host. In addition, Antia et al. (2003), showed that factors such as ecological changes, even when they increase the R\n0 value of the pathogen to a level not sufficient to cause an epidemic (i.e. R\n0 still less than one), can greatly increase the length of stochastic chains of disease transmission. These long transmission chains provide an opportunity for the pathogen to adapt to human hosts, and thus for the disease to emerge.",

(2006) suggested that one way to explore how virulence in parasites is connected to the shape and the size of reserves would be to manipulate variables influencing host densities in large experimental areas and to measure the resulting consequences on parameters linked to virulence. Alternatively, several studies have shown that grouping (as a behavioural trait) may vary between populations, and/or can also be selected for in certain species (see Krause & Ruxton 2002). Such situations could be used to explore the parasitic consequences of overcrowding. Species comparisons may also allow far\u2010reaching conclusions regarding the relationships between social organization and ecological parameters like parasitism. For instance, animals that regularly and naturally congregate at extremely high densities on small areas (e.g. pinnipeds, penguins or shorebirds) provide fruitful biological situations to consider. Indeed, because social congregation on islands is somewhat analogous to protected areas in terms of isolation, but also results from thousands of years of evolution, these species might help to predict long\u2010term ecological and parasitological consequences of overcrowding (Lebarbenchon et al. 2006).",

            "text": "Several recent studies on pathogens of forests and human crops, for which long\u2010term data exist, show sensitivity of some pathogens and vectors to climate factors (Harvell et al. 2002). It is therefore likely that pathogens affecting wild populations will experience similar climate\u2010driven changes. The most notable prediction of anthropogenic global change is widespread increases in average temperatures. Given that distributions and performances of parasites (as for all species) are bounded by suitable climatic conditions, climate changes are expected to alter the ecology and geographical distribution of parasitic diseases (Lafferty & Kuris 2005 for a review). For instance, van Riper et al. (1986) demonstrated that the highest incidence of malaria in Hawaii birds occurs in wet midelevation forests (between 900 m and 1500 m) where populations of Culex mosquitoes overlap with highly susceptible native birds. Climate warming is expected to (i) increase pathogen development rates, transmission and number of generations per year and survival rates; (ii) relaxing overwintering restrictions on pathogen life cycles; and (iii) modifying host susceptibility to infection (Harvell et al. 2002). Although most host\u2010parasite systems are predicted to experience more frequent or severe disease impacts with warming, some parasites should however, be more sensitive to warming than others. Temperature is particularly important when hosts are ectotherms that do not actively regulate their temperature. Pathogen taxa with \u2018external\u2019 stages (helminth worms, vector\u2010transmitted pathogens like protozoa and reservoir\u2010borne diseases like many viruses) should have also more opportunity to interact with climatic conditions, as the host's range and its environmental requirements constrain the parasitic range. According to Woolhouse & Gowtage\u2010Sequeria (2005), 58% of a total set of 1407 recognized species of human pathogens are zoonotic, and thus are constrained by the animal host's spatial range. At the moment, a majority of zoonotic and vector\u2010borne pathogens are endemic to tropical zones, but such a picture could change following temperature alterations.",

Most fitness traits for hosts and their parasites will exhibit a peak performance at a thermal optimum. If the relationship between performance and temperature differs between host and parasite, the resulting gene by gene by environment interaction will either increase or decrease disease at a given temperature, at least on the level of the individual host. For example, the optimal temperature of a fungal pathogen is higher than the optimal temperature of its sea fan host, placing the sea fan at risk to global warming. The number of host\u2013parasite associations in this case is not known at the moment but potentially high. Of course, with global warming happening gradually, the optimal temperature of pathogens can evolve. And it can do so more rapidly than that of the host, given the fact that generation times of pathogens are often orders of magnitude shorter than those of their hosts.",

Increased precipitation should favour waterborne parasites as well as those requiring vectoring by biting arthropods with juvenile aquatic stages (e.g. mosquitoes). Modellers have used the association between climate and mosquito distributions along with predicted patterns of climate change to further predict that the potential for malaria transmission will greatly expand in the future. Humidity associated with increased precipitation should favour some parasites, especially nematodes transmitted by eggs or with free\u2010living juvenile stages; elsewhere, though, higher temperatures will desiccate soils. Increased aridity should impair the transmission of parasites with stages that live in soil. Change in temperature and precipitation interact with parasitism in complex ways, making it difficult to generalize broadly about its effects on disease (Lafferty & Kuris 2005). One possible bridging solution to this gap is to separate the independent and interactive effects of multiple climate drivers on disease impact (Harvell et al. 2002).",

Although in part responsible for climate change, chemical pollution can also have more direct effects on the ecology and evolution of pathogens. Toxic chemicals are now ubiquitous in the environment, especially in freshwater ecosystems. They are known to directly affect host susceptibility, through reduced immunocompetence, as well as the infective stages of pathogens outside their host (Poulin 1992). This can have obvious evolutionary impacts. For instance, we now have much empirical evidence showing that pollutants reduce the lifespan of the free\u2010living infective stages of many pathogens (Pietrock & Marcogliese 2003), and that the survival of infective stages in the external environment is a key driver of the evolution of pathogen virulence (Walther & Ewald 2004). The harsher conditions for infective stages resulting from pollution affect transmission success and may be selecting for pathogen strains with different levels of virulence.",

The application of evolutionary theory to the medical sciences has been organized under the banner of \u2018Darwinian Medicine\u2019 (Williams & Nesse 1991; Stearns & Ebert 2001). Applied to infectious diseases, Darwinian Medicine considers the interaction between host and parasite as a potentially long\u2010lasting struggle between largely opposing strategies of replication. The key applied interest of this approach is that it allows a predictive framework for the direction this struggle will take, allowing in principle the design of medical and public health measures that if not ensuring eradication can at least favour less virulent strains (Ewald 1994; Dieckmann et al. 2002).",

The \u2018virulence management\u2019 approach is characterized by a focus on the epidemiological scale, focusing on complexities on the host population scale (e.g. patterns of transmission and host death), at the expense of complexities on the within\u2010host level. Typically, virulence is viewed as an unavoidable side effect of parasite exploitation and transmission to a new host (Dieckmann et al. 2002; for a critique see Ebert & Bull 2003). A central and significant challenge in the study of parasite virulence is to use ecological and evolutionary theory to integrate the intricacies of within\u2010host interactions between host and pathogen into this broader epidemiological framework, to derive predictions of the relationship between parasite exploitation, virulence and transmission (Ganusov et al. 2002; Alizon & Van Baalen 2005; Andr\u00e9 & Gandon 2006; Gilchrist & Coombs 2006; S.P. Brown, L. Le Chat, F. Taddei, in preparation). Looking within the host raises a number of significant theoretical challenges, such as capturing explicit immunological dynamics (S. Alizon, in preparation), parasite\u2013parasite interactions (Brown et al. 2002; Gardner et al. 2004; Brown et al. 2006a), fine\u2010scale (cellular) spatial structure (Brown et al. 2006b) and a merging of ecological and evolutionary timescales (Alizon & van Baalen 2005).
