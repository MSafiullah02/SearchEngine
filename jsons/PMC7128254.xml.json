More than three-quarters of the world's nations and territories have been affected, and cases are being found in previously unaffected areas each day [1]. At the time of writing, there were 500,000 confirmed cases worldwide, with nearly 25,000 deaths [1]; these numbers are expected to grow in the coming weeks and months. Although data surrounding the novel coronavirus are rapidly evolving, initial estimates depict a dire situation: 20% of infections lead to severe or critical disease [2]. Mortality has varied across settings, but early data suggest a case fatality rate near 4% [4,5].",

There, highly vulnerable populations, compromised by malnutrition and comorbid diseases, face a greater risk of developing severe and critical disease [3]. Early recognition, resuscitation and referral have proven key to effective responses, yielding lower mortality [7]. These processes are, however, significantly more challenging in low-resource settings (LRS) [3,6]. Most LRS have scarce critical care resources, with limitations in the availability of oxygen and other basics, as well as healthcare provider shortages [8,9]. Immediate targeted efforts are needed to assist these settings in managing large numbers of acutely ill COVID-19 patients.",

The tool aims to aid frontline providers in rapidly determining which patients presenting to Emergency Units (EUs) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 require respiratory interventions. The tool assigns patients into a severity category that aligns to WHO's classification: critical, severe and moderate/mild. By definition, critical patients require ventilation; severe patients require oxygen; moderate patients have pneumonia but no oxygen need, and mild patients only have upper respiratory tract disease. An early assessment suggests that the tool correctly classifies 93.6% of patients, overestimating 5.7% and underestimating 0.8% of patient severities.",

Practical and realistic strategies are presented for EU care of patients of all severity levels, with the assumption that there is no easy access to more advanced testing such as troponin or CT scan.",
