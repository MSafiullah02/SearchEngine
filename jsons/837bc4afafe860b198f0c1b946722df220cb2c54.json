Vpu achieves its task by (a) interacting with CD4, the HIV-1 receptor, and (b) by amplifying particle release at the site of the plasma membrane. While the first role is due to interactions of the cytoplasmic site of Vpu with CD4, the second role may be due to ion channel activity caused by the self-assembly of the protein. Recently, a blocker has been proposed which abolishes channel activity. In this chapter, the mechanism of blocking is described using computational methods, including a brief overview of other viral ion channel blockers.",

This is due to the difficulties in obtaining enough structural information for accessible regions (loops), which is a desirable prerequisite for fast drug discovery. Recent attempts to derive relatively large quantities of the full length of short viral membrane proteins, with up to 100 amino acids by applying standard solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), have been successfully achieved for M2 from influenza A (Kochend\u00f6rfer et al., 1999) . The two 50mer ends of the protein have been synthesized and chemically ligated to obtain the full-length protein. It is claimed that with this method, even noncoded amino acids can be incorporated, which would mean in case of Vpu, two phosphorylated serines (Ser-52 and Ser-56) would need to be added. Despite the still missing experimental verification the method will play an important role in the future in obtaining sufficient quantities of small proteins in general (Kochendoerfer et al., 2004) .",

CD, FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy (see Chapters 11 and 13 by Opella et al. and Bechinger and Henklein, respectively, this book) have been carried out on parts of Vpu, for example, the transmembrane (TM) part in various lengths and solely the cytoplasmic part. Thereby, the fragments have been produced either by SPPS or expression methodology. The structural information is sufficient to enable the generation of computational models. These models, especially the models representing the TM segment of Vpu, have been embedded in hydrophobic slabs, surrounded by octane to mimic a lipid bilayer, or in fully hydrated lipid bilayers on an all atom basis (reviewed in Fischer, 2003) . Recently, even a full-length model based on the structural information of all these fragments has been produced and embedded in a lipid monolayer (Sun, 2003) . The models can be used for docking approaches and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enabling detailed structural analysis, until high-resolution data are available. Once a high-resolution structure is available, these methods may furthermore be used to refine the static structure, predict protein mechanics and putative drug-protein interactions.",

Its role and structure are reported in detail in other chapters of this book. In brief, its function in the life cycle of HIV-1 is 2 fold (for reviews, see Fischer and Sansom, 2002; Bour and Strebel, 2003; Fischer, 2003; Montal, 2003) : (a) to interact with CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum to initiate the ubiquinine mediated degradation of the CD4-Vpu complex, and (b) to enhance particle release at the site of the plasma membrane altering the electrochemical gradient via ion channel formation by homo oligomerization in the lipid membrane or interacting with other ion channels (Hsu et al., 2004) . While the first function is fairly established, the second is still open to debate (Lamb and Pinto, 1997) . For example, it is not known whether ion channel activity is an intrinsic part of Vpu's function. However, Vpu, either with its TM domain synthesized using SPPS or as full-length protein from expression and reconstituted into lipid bilayers, shows channel activity Schubert et al., 1996; Marassi et al., 1999; Cordes et al., 2002; Park et al., 2003) . Recently, a drug has been described which blocks channel activity of Vpu in vitro (Ewart et al., 2002) and also of p7 from hepatitis C virus (Premkumar et al., 2004) . The molecule causing this effect is a derivative of amiloride, cyclohexamethylene amiloride.",

The cytoplasmic domain seems to be in contact with the membrane (Marassi et al., 1999; Henklein et al., 2000; Zheng et al., 2003) . The tilt angle of the TM segment with respect to the membrane normal using different techniques and Vpu constructs has been found to range from approximately 6\u040a to 30\u040a (Kukol and Arkin, 1999; Marassi et al., 1999; Wray et al., 1999; Henklein et al., 2000) . The most recent NMR spectroscopic study indicates a kink of the TM segment of about 12-15\u040a around residue Ile-17 (Park et al., 2003) . Based on these experimental results, several models of Vpu have been proposed from computer simulations (Grice et al., 1997; Cordes et al., 2002; Lopez et al., 2002; Sramala et al., 2003; Sun, 2003) .",

In docking methods, the protein and the ligand are transferred to a point on a grid. Smaller spacing of the grid increases the accuracy of the method, which proceeds in parallel with an increase in computer time for the calculations. Pioneering work in this field has been achieved by Peter Goodford (Goodford, 1985; Boobyer et al., 1989; Wade et al., 1993) . In this method, putative docking sites and the potency of different conformations of a drug have been assessed based on calculating electrostatic interactions. To date, several other docking software are available differing in the function implemented to evaluate the fit (scoring) of a drug to the binding site (scoring function). In principle, both the protein and the drug are held rigid during the calculation to save computer time. More advanced methods allow for the ligand to be flexible (Wang et al., 1999; Kua et al., 2002) and even the protein (Carlson and McCammon, 2000) . Another improvement of the docking approach is the introduction of the energy of solvation of the ligand for evaluation of binding affinities and consequently the scoring (Shoichet et al., 1999) . In the present study, AUTODOCK (Morris et al., 1998) was used, in which the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (GA) is applied. The ligand explores randomly translational, orientational, and conformational space with respect to a rigid protein. To avoid extreme CPU time due to the endless number of possible combinations in the search, GAs are combined with a local search (LS) protocol, which allows for energy minimization at low temperatures. However, a general drawback for the docking software is the inability to include the electrostatic contributions of a lipid bilayer environment.",

            "text": "MD simulations per se describe the changes of positions, velocities, and orientations of a system with time, based on Newtonian principles. From the trajectories, time averages of macroscopic properties can be deduced. Any screening of a protein surface by a drug or ligand would cost almost endless MD simulation time, which would impose software failures and consequently inaccurate results. Moving a ligand around a protein surface might be envisaged by the use of \"artificial\" force on the ligand. Steered MD simulation is a step in this direction used till date for protein folding (Lu et al., 1998; Gao et al., 2002) and to propose pathways of molecules into or out of known biding sites (Kosztin et al., 1999; Isralewitz et al., 2001; Shen et al., 2003) . A workaround is the combined use of a docking approach followed by a MD simulation or molecular mechanics calculations (Wang et al., 2001; Beierlein et al., 2003) . However, using solely MD simulations for the exploration of the drug and the protein is becoming an increasingly valuable tool. Recent investigations on the effect of general anesthetics on the ion channel gramicidin A have been investigated (Tang and Xu, 2002) . In this study, the missing local changes on the protein caused by the drugs have been correlated with a low affinity of the general anesthetics to their target. In another approach, effects of mutations on the structure of the HIV-1 integrase have been analyzed using MD simulations (Barreca et al., 2003) . Simulations have also been done in the presence of an inhibitor (5CITEP) to address drug-protein interactions. In the present chapter, the putative binding site of amiloride (Am) and cyclohexamethylene amiloride (Hma) with the TM domain of Vpu has been derived from the docking approach. In the docking approach, a pentameric bundle was used to discover the binding site. Simulations were then run with the protein bundle-drug complex for 12 ns. The topology of the drug and its partial atomic charges have been determined by PRODRUG (van Aalten et al., 1996) and adapted for the force field GROMOS43a2.",

            "text": "The question of where the blocker binds can be addressed using docking programs, even though they are not designed to search within pore-like structures. In the present study, the program AUTODOCK is used for Am and the most potent blocker Hma, both in protonated (AM \u03e9 , HMA \u03e9 )-the most likely form under physiological conditions-and unprotonated (AM, HMA) forms (C. Kim, V. Lemaitre, A. Watts, W.B. Fischer, in preparation) . The Vpu models used are single-stranded Vpu, corresponding to the TM helix of Vpu, Vpu 1-32 (Figure 14 .1) and the extended kinked model Vpu 1-52 . Models with assembled helices forming pentameric and hexameric bundles are generated and also used in the docking approach. The single peptides are rationalized by the idea of a possible binding mechanism in which the blocker binds prior to the formation of ion conducting bundles. The results can be summarized in such a way that the putative binding site is toward the C terminal end of the peptides and, in case of the bundles, within the pore. The specific residue to which the blockers establish contact is Ser-23. The type of interaction is via hydrogen bonding. Calculated binding constants are found to be of the same range as those derived from experiments (Fischer, Lam, Watts, Fischer, unpublished results) . Based on these findings MD simulations may follow to address the dynamics of the blocker and the protein in an almost realistic environment of a hydrated lipid bilayer (Lemaitre et al., 2004) . Studies of membrane proteins embedded in a hydrated lipid bilayer have been highly successful in describing the mechanism of function of ion channels on an atomic level (Tieleman et al., 1997; Sansom et al., 1998; Shrivastava and Sansom, 2000; Berneche and Roux, 2001; de Groot and Grubm\u00fcller, 2001; Im and Roux, 2002; Zhu et al., 2002; B\u00f6ckmann and Grubm\u00fcller, 2002) .",

These correlated motions or principal components have been shown to describe motions which are relevant for the function of proteins. The technique involves the removal of the overall rotation and translation to isolate the internal motion only. This is achieved by a least square fitting to a reference structure and computation of the covariance matrix C of the atomic coordinates. The principal components are then obtained by diagonalizing the matrix C with an orthonormal transformation (Amadei et al., 1993) .",

The root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of the individual atoms of the blockers indicate the central body of Am (a 3,4,6-substituted pyrazine ring) and Hma, remain fairly rigid (RMSF \u03fd 0.1 nm) independent of the protonation state of the blockers. Only the hydrogen atoms of the amino groups of the pyrazine ring and the guanidinium group show the largest fluctuations (\u05460.1 nm). The curves albeit very similar for both blockers, when compared with similar atoms, adopt slightly lower values for all atoms in the protonated blocker. The cyclohexamethylene ring in Hma fluctuates around 0.1 nm, independent of the protonation state. Thus, the hexamethylene ring adds a mobile part to the rigid pyrazine ring.",

            "text": "The blockers, independent of their protonation state, interact with the protein via hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bond partners are the serine side chains (Ser-23) which point into the pore. Therefore, the most prominent difference between AM \u03e9 and HMA \u03e9 is that, in addition to these hydrogen bonds, HMA \u03e9 also interacts with one of the tryptophans (Trp-22) which comes to reside at the helix-helix and helix-lipid interface. The cause of this interaction might be due to the lower average velocity of HMA \u03e9 within the site. In addition to this dynamic affect, HMA \u03e9 orients with its hydrophobic cyclomethylene ring stronger to the hydrophobic part of the pore toward the N-terminal end. This is reflected by an average angle of 43.0 \u03ee 11.8\u040a for HMA \u03e9 and 11.3 \u03ee 12.7\u040a for HMA with respect to the membrane plane. AM \u03e9 and AM adopt angles of 5.3 \u03ee 23.3\u040a and 8.6 \u03ee 51.8\u040a, respectively. The larger standard deviation reflects the higher flexibility of the Am within the pore. The MD simulations have been based on results obtained from a docking approach performed with the AUTODOCK software. The blocker was placed at a site suggested by AUTODOCK. The question arises, would MD simulations be able to deliver the same result? In order to address this question, a series of 1 ns simulation have been performed with a pentameric bundle and HMA \u03e9 at different position along the z-axis within the pore of a pentameric bundle (Figure 14 .5). The results in terms of the stability of the bundle and the overall structure remain similar to the results of the long simulations here (data not shown). The integrity of the bundle is not destroyed, independent of the position of the blocker. It is interesting to note that in all of the positions, other than the one used for the longer simulations (position at the Ser-23 site), does the blocker leaves its starting position after 1 ns. To put the individual pictures in context, any position of the HMA \u03e9 toward the C-or N-terminal end of the bundle may force the blocker to orientate its long axis parallel to the pore axis, and beyond a certain threshold position even to escape from the pore.",

In this case, the question is allowed: how realistic are the bundles? Experimental studies propose that Vpu exists as an oligomer (Maldarelli et al., 1993) . Computational experiments on solely the TM segments have been undertaken to relate the experimentally derived cation selectivity of Vpu to the number of segments forming the bundle (Grice et al., 1997) . In these studies, the low energy for a K \u03e9 to pass the pore compared to the higher value obtained for Cl \u03ea for the pentameric bundle supports the idea of a pentameric model. In a combined experimental and computational approach, the tetrameric bundle was excluded as a putative pore (Cordes et al., 2002) . However, direct structural evidence is still lacking. Thus, Vpu could also be a tetramer unless proven by, for example, X-ray, spectroscopy or otherwise, and thus, investigations are carried out with the pentameric and hexameric bundles. The overall orientation of the helices, having the serines facing the lumen of the pore, is based on findings for other ion channels (Leonard et al., 1988; Galzi et al., 1991; Pebay-Peyroula et al., 1997; Pautsch and Schulz, 2000; Sass et al., 2000) . Most recent solid-state NMR spectroscopic investigations propose a kink around Ile-17 (Park et al., 2003) . The computer models are generated without an explicit kink; however, the analysis of the bundles using residues Ile-16 to Ala-18 as center point also reveal on average a kink of the helices. Differences in the absolute values may derive from the different lipids used and the length of the peptides, including additional residues at the C-terminal end to enable facilitated purification.",

            "text": "Am (3,5-diamino-6-chloro-N-(diaminomethylene)pyrazinecarboxamide) is a moderately strong base with a pK a of 8.7 (Schellenberg et al., 1985; Kleyman and Cragoe, 1988) . At physiological pH at least 95%, Am exists in a positively charged form due to the protonated guanidinium group (Cragoe et al., 1967) . In the case of epithelial Na \u03e9 channels, this protonated form is essential for blocking, indicative of a pH-dependent activity (Kleyman and Cragoe, 1988) . Am is soluble in water up to 16 mM (Benos, 1982) . The deprotonated form is lipid soluble and can easily cross the cell membrane with the consequence of accumulating within the cell and altering a number of cellular processes (Benos, 1982; Kleyman and Cragoe, 1988; Grinstein et al., 1989) . Am cannot be metabolized in the body, so it is eliminated intact in urine and has a biological half-life of 9.6 \u03ee 1.8 hr (Smith and Smith, 1973) . Am and its derivatives are a class of potent blockers of Na \u03e9 transporters such as the epithelial Na \u03e9 channels (ENaC), Na \u03e9 /H \u03e9 exchanger and, to a lesser extent, the Na \u03e9 /Ca 2\u03e9 exchanger Cragoe, 1988, 1990) . Cyclohexamethylene amiloride was reported to be especially selective for the Na \u03e9 /H \u03e9 exchanger (Kleyman and Cragoe, 1988) . Hydrophobic interactions with parts of the channel adjacent to the Am binding site increases the binding affinity of the blocker (Garty and Palmer, 1997) . For Am, a putative binding site in the Na \u03e9 channel has been proposed to be approximately 20% within the TM electrical field (Li et al., 1987; Fyfe and Canessa, 1998) on the extracellular side (Benos, 1982) . The orientation is proposed to allow the guanidinium group to penetrate into the pore (reviewed in Alvarez de la Rosa et al., 2000) . Using anti-Am antibodies, a six amino acid sequence of WYRFHY (extracellular loop of \u2423-rENaC), WYKLHY (\u2424-and \u2425-ENaC subunit) and WYHFHY (\u2426-ENaC subunit) (Kieber-Emmos et al., 1995; Waldmann et al., 1995; Ismailov et al., 1997; Schild et al., 1997) has been identified as a putative binding site. Replacement of the second His-282 in the \u2426-ENaC subunit by glutamate abolishes the blocking while replacement by arginine increases the blocking. Another point mutation within the TM region replacing a crucial serine residue also abolishes affinity for Am (Waldmann et al., 1995) . This indicates that the sequence, including an aromatic residue, a positively charged residue, and a serine in the vicinity of a hydrophobic site, is a key feature for binding Am and its derivatives. Consequently, the binding site proposed, with the guanidinium group in the vicinity of the serines of the putative pore of Vpu in the present study, is in agreement with findings on the ENaC.",

The binding site for these blockers, and also procaine (Adams, 1977) , is proposed to be at a site within the pore which should be near to the ring of serines and threonines found in the pore of the receptor (Leonard et al., 1988) . Based on experimental findings, computational experiments, using the Monte Carlo minimization method, have been performed on a model of the nAChR based on its TM helices of M2 (Tikhonov and Zhorov, 1998) . The data analyzed the binding geometry of, for example, QX-222 and Chlorpromazin (CPZ). It is found that the charged groups interact with the side chains of the serines and threonines , and the uncharged groups interact with the ring of hydrophobic residues (Leu-11, Ala-12). The blockers orient their long axis along the axis of the bundle due to the amphiphatic character of the drugs.",

The pentameric and hexameric bundles are embedded in an octane slab which mimics the lipid bilayer. The long-range electrostatic interactions have been treated with Ewald sums. These findings are indicative for a fluctuating number of water molecules within the pore. Recent investigations on theoretical hydrophobic pore models show that the presence of water in these pores is strongly dependent on the pore radius (Beckstein and Sansom, 2003) . Below 0.4 nm, the water density found decreases to almost zero. Water molecules, if bigger than 0.4 nm, traverse the pore in an \"avalanche-like fashion\" (Beckstein and Sansom, 2003) . For very small radii, simulations on a very long timescale (\u03fe50 ns) are needed to assess the proper behavior of the water molecules in confined geometry. Thus, the Vpu bundle model presented here shows a proper bundle with a temporary state of low water content.",

In the meantime, the combination of MD simulations with docking approaches has been proven to be a powerful tool for lead discovery (Wang et al., 2001; Kua et al., 2002) . MD simulations with the drug will increasingly play an important role in the exploration of the dynamics of the ligand and its impact on the protein structure (Tang and Xu, 2002) .

Its site of blocking is assumed to be within the lumen of the pore with residues such as Val-27, Ala-30, and Ser-31 involved (Duff and Ashley, 1992; Pinto et al., 1992; Duff et al., 1993) . For a detailed review, see Chapter 8 by Y. Tang et al., this book . Also NB, an influenza B membrane protein forming ion channels, can be blocked by amantadine (Sunstrom et al., 1996; Fischer et al., 2001) . However, the binding constants proposed for blocking are too high to propose NB as a potential target. The short viral membrane protein p7 from Hepatitis C virus also exhibits ion channel activity (Griffin et al., 2003; Pavlovic et al., 2003) . For this channel, amantadine seems to block channel activity (Griffin et al., 2003) . However, it could be shown that this channel can also be blocked by long-alkyl-chain iminosugar derivatives (Pavlovic et al., 2003) . Structural and, consequently, computational data, still need to be produced to get more insight about the putative binding site of these blockers. With Vpu as another viral ion channel forming protein, the number of HIV protein targets has been enlarged by the discovery of Am derivatives as potential channel blockers (Ewart et al., 2002 ; see also Chapter 15 by P. Gage et al., this book) . Derivatives of amantadine, spiro 5-and 6-membered analogs, have been identified for weak HIV-1 activity (Kolocouris et al., 1996) . Since they have not been active against HIV-2, which does not encode Vpu, it is tempting to assume blocking of either one or both of the two roles of Vpu in the infected cell. Possibly other viral ion channel proteins and viroporins may become highly important future drug targets and we might be just at the beginning of a fruitful time in this respect.",
