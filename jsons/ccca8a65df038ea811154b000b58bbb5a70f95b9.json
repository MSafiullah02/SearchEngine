A distance function is defined in order to evaluate the \"closeness\" of two processes and a few useful mathematical properties are derived. Theoretical results to guarantee the correctness of the identification procedure for networked linear systems with tree topology are provided as well. Finally, the application of the techniques to the analysis of an actual complex network, i.e. to high frequency time series of the stock market, is illustrated.",

            "text": "Under the influence of improved numerical tools, a significant interest for complex systems has been shown in many scientific fields. In particular, attention has been focused on networks, highlighting the emergence of complicated phenomena from the connection of simple models. To this regard, a relevant impulse has been provided by the advances in neural network theory, that has contributed to underline the importance of the connection topology in the realization of complex dynamics [1] . As a consequence, graph theory [2] has been successfully exploited to perform novel modeling approaches in several fields, such as Economics (see e.g. [3] , [4] , [5] ), Biology (see e.g. [6] , [7] ) and Ecology (see e.g. [8] , [9] , [10] ), especially when the investigated phenomena were characterized by spatial distribution and a multivariate analysis technique is preferred [11] , [12] . To the best knowledge of the authors, there are very few theoretical results about the reconstruction of an unknown topology from data. In this paper, we will focus our attention on tree topology networks. Though its reduced complexity with respect to cyclic link structures, the tree connection model turns out to be particularly suitable to represent a large variety of processes. In particular, the tree network scheme results effective in the description of systems with transportation, such as water and power supply, air and rail traffic, vascular systems of living organisms and channel and drainage networks (see e.g. [13] , [9] , [14] , [15] , [16] ). It is worth to highlight that this kind of models is deeply related to the idea of delay, that characterizes the connections as transportation media. It is also important to recall that in linear dynamical system theory the transfer function is a powerful representation tool for delayed processes [17] , [18] . In many situations, when the topology to be reconstructed is a tree, the only observable nodes are the leaves. Then, the usual theoretical framework is almost always set in standard graph theory as in the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) [19] . Its application is mainly in the reconstruction of evolutionary trees, but it has been widely employed also in many other areas: communication systems and resource allocations. Theoretically, such a technique guarantees an exact reconstruction of a tree topology only on the strong assumption that an ultrametric is defined among the considered nodes. An approach based on system theory and identification tools is completely missing. Specifically, there are no approaches considering explicitly the possibility of dynamics among the nodes. While dynamical networks have been deeply studied and analyzed in automatic control theory, the question of reconstructing an unknown network of dynamical systems has not been formally investigated. In fact, in most applicative scenarios the network is given or it is the very objective of design. However, there are also some interesting situations where the network links are actually unknown, such as in biological neural networks, biochemical metabolic pathways and financial markets. Even though an acyclical topology may seem a quite reductive choice, given an intricate and connected topology, we may be interested into \"approximating\" it with a tree. Such an approximation could be considered \"satisfactory\" if the most important connections were captured. In this manuscript we will develop a rigorous mathematical method to exactly identify the connections scheme of a tree topology network of noisy linear dynamical systems, providing a theoretical background for linear network modeling. In particular, in Section II we will introduce definitions and preliminary results which are useful to characterize the mathematical framework. In Section III our approach to topology reconstruction will be presented and sufficient conditions for an exact identification will be reported as well. In Section IV the theoretical results will be confirmed by practical implementations of the proposed technique, illustrated by means of numerical examples. In Section V, we will show that the identification of a tree topology can provide useful information even for complex network. To this end, we will apply our technique to the analysis of high frequency real data originated by a portfolio of financial stocks. Some final conclusions in Section VI will end the manuscript.",

Moreover, it might seem very reductive the attempt to describe the dependencies among the price trends in terms of linear SISO systems with a tree topology. In fact, we should definitely expect multiple input influences, nonlinear relations and feedbacks. However, we can think of adopting a LCMT in order to detect what are the \"strongest\" links in the network. As noted in [3] , such an information could be usefully exploited to check if a given portfolio is balanced or not. In the following, we report the results obtained by the application of our identification technique. A collection of 100 stocks of the New York Stock Exchange has been observed for four weeks (twenty market days), in the lapse 03/03/2008 -03/28/2008 sampling their prices every 2 minutes. The stocks have been chosen on the first 100 stocks with highest trading volume according to the Standard Fig. 3 .

Using the industry classification given by Google, the Financial sector has also been differentiated among Insurance Companies (light green), Banks (average green) and Investment Companies (dark green); Services have been divided in Information Technology (cyan) and Retail (aquamarina), Consumer in Food (plum) and Personal-care (purple); Energy in Oil & Gas (dark gray) and Well Equipment (light gray); Utilities in Electrical (dark brown) and Natural Gas (light brown).",

            "text": "& Poor Index at the first day of observation and they are reported in Table II . An a-priori organization of the companies has been assumed in accordance with the sector and industry group classification provided by Google Finance R , that is also the source of our data. The whole observation horizon spans almost the whole month of March. Hence, the corresponding price series can not be considered stationary and the statistical tools can not be successfully employed to analyze the raw data. In literature a variety of techniques for the suppression of trends and periodic components in non-stationary time series exists. However, we want to stress that the application of such procedures introduces an additional prefiltering phase, which is responsible for the computational burden increase. Moreover, due to the pre-and post-market sessions, there is a discontinuity between the end value of a day and the opening price of the next one. We have avoided those problems observing that the observation horizon is naturally divided into subperiods, namely weeks and days. In addition, a single market session can be considered a time period sufficiently short to assume that the influence of trends and seasonal factors are negligible. Thus, in our analysis, we have followed the natural approach of dividing the historical series into twenty subperiods corresponding to single days. Then, we considered the sessions separately, i.e. we have computed the coherence-based distances (10) among the stocks for every single day. Finally, we have averaged such daily distances over the whole observation horizon and the related results have been exploited to extract the MST, providing the corresponding market structure. We find useful to remark that the computation of the distances for smaller data sets is also better performing and that the averaging procedure provides the desired rejection of trends and seasonal components. Notably, a similar idea, even if more sophisticated, is at the basis of the method developed in [21] to detrend non-stationary time series. The final topology is shown in Figure 3 . Every node represents a stock and the color represents the business sector or industry it belongs to. We note that the stocks are very satisfactorily grouped according to their business sectors. We stress that the a-priori classification in sectors is not a hard fact by itself and we are not trying to match it exactly. A company could well be categorized in a sector because of its business, but, at the same time, could show a behaviour similar to and explainable through the dynamics of other sectors. Actually, we would be very interested into finding results of this kind. Indeed, in those very cases, our quantitative analysis would provide the greatest contributions detecting in an objective way something which is \"counter-intuitive\". Thus, we just use such a-priori classification as a tool to check if the final topology makes sense and if, at a general level, our approach provides useful results. Despite this disclaim, it is worth noting that the Financial (green tints), Consumer (violet tints), Basic Materials (yellow), Energy (gray tints) and Transportation (dark blue) sectors are all perfectly grouped, with no exceptions. In Fig. 3 , we note a subclusterization of the Financial sector, as well. The Consumer sector shows another prominent subclusterization in the Food (plum) and Personal/Healthcare (purple) industries, while the Energy sector presents an evident subclusterization into the Oil & Gas (dark gray) and Oil Well Equipment (light gray). The Utilities/Electricity companies (dark brown) are, interestingly, a different group. We also observe a big cluster of companies classified as Services (light blue tints). We have differentiated them in the two industries Retail and Information Technology using two slightly different colors, respectively aquamarine and cyan. We also note the presence of three Services companies which are isolated from the other ones: V [Verizon], T [AT&T], and S [Sprint]. All of them are telephone companies. This might suggest that this industry should show at least a slightly different dynamics from the other service companies. Note also how the Technology sector (red) is almost perfectly grouped and how IBM, an IT company, even though classified as a Services company, is located in it. Finally, the two only automobile companies GM and F [Ford] happen to be linked together. The analysis of this four weeks of the month of March cleanly shows a taxonomic arrangement of the stocks even though the choice of a tree structure might have seemed quite reductive at first thought.",
