Obesity is associated with increased risk of multiple disorders, including diabetes mellitus, hepatic and renal dysfunction, certain cancers, sleep disorders and infertility [3]. Despite this, increasing body mass index (BMI) appears to have a protective effect on mortality in certain disease states, a phenomenon termed the \u201cObesity Paradox.\u201d Several studies have shown either a U-shaped or J-shaped relationship between BMI and mortality in which overweight and Class I obese patients have increased survival compared to normal weight and underweight patients, with mortality trending upwards in Class II and III obesity. This \u201cparadox\u201d has been seen in patients with Type II diabetes, coronary artery disease, numerous malignancies and in the critically ill [4\u201312].",

Outliers of weight and height (weight <30 kg or >600 kg, height <80 cm or >250 cm), as well as patients with incomplete data were removed from the study. Basic descriptive statistics were performed. For the primary analysis, logistic regression was conducted to assess the adjusted mortality odds associated with each WHO category, adjusting for statistically significant covariables and their power transformations and interaction terms to optimize the model as determined by the Box\u2013Tidwell model method. Given its clinical relevance, mechanism of injury was included in the model, though the variable representing blunt injury was not statistically significant. The final model was adjusted for age (transformed), sex, injury severity score (ISS), blunt mechanism, penetrating mechanism, pulse, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on arrival, as well as diagnosis of diabetes, COPD, cirrhosis or CHF, and smoking status. Pearson goodness-of-fit test was performed, and area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) was calculated. The model was then tested using NTDB data from 2013, with AUROC calculated for comparison.",

[16] found no association between obesity and mortality in critically injured blunt trauma patients, while studies by Neville et al. [25] and Brown et al. [21] found that obesity did have an association with increased mortality. Examining Class III obesity, studies by Diaz et al. [15] and Ditillo et al. [24] found increased mortality in trauma patients with BMI \u226540. The inconsistencies in the results between previous works are likely secondary to single-institution retrospective designs, leading to small sample sizes. Additionally, obesity was often a binary variable in previous studies, limiting the ability to assess the association of each BMI category with mortality and ignoring the nonlinear relationship between increasing BMI and death. By examining all BMI categories, we were able to demonstrate the presence of an obesity paradox in trauma patients.",

            "text": "There are several proposed mechanisms to explain the obesity paradox. Adipose tissue has cytokines which impact immune function. One of those cytokines is leptin, which is found in increased levels in overweight and obese patients. Leptin deficiency has been associated with increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections, as well as increased susceptibility to the toxicity of proinflammatory stimuli [26]. Patients with increased leptin levels may have an advantage in fighting infection, which may benefit critically ill trauma patients at increased risk of infection. Another possible explanation is the presence of increased metabolic and energy reserves in obese patients [27]. Admission to the ICU is often associated with malnutrition [28], and obese patients might better tolerate a temporary state of malnutrition given their increased energy stores.",

BMI does not differentiate muscle mass from fat mass and is thus not able to differentiate fitness from adiposity [29]. This has been demonstrated when other measures of obesity are used to examine the association between obesity and mortality in patients with heart failure. When waist-to-hip ratio or waist circumference is used as a measure of obesity, rather than BMI, the obesity paradox in patients with heart failure disappears [29, 30]. If BMI is in fact a useful metric, this study brings into question the categorization of BMI. As opposed to the presence of an actual paradox, the presence of the obesity paradox across many different disease states may reflect too narrow or a skewed definition of what a normal BMI is.",

The association between increased BMI and increased LOS, ICU LOS and ventilator days is congruent with other publications examining the impact of obesity on trauma [16, 21, 22, 24]. Obesity is associated with reduced lung volumes, decreased lung compliance and reduced gas exchange, leading to difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation [31]. Furthermore, it is associated with increased ICU resource utilization, as well increased nursing-care burden [32, 33]. Some combination of these factors likely explains the demonstrated increase in LOS and ventilator days among all BMI categories above normal, despite overweight and Class I obesity having a protective effect on mortality.",
