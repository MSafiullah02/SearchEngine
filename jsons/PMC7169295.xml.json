            "text": "Leishmaniasis is a worldwide infectious disease of people and wild and domestic animals caused by diphasic protozoans of the genus Leishmania. It is a frequent cause of clinical disease in dogs and less common in cats and humans.\n1\n, \n2\n Natural leishmaniasis infection appears to be rare in the cat. Since 1911 about 50 cases of feline leishmaniasis have been reported.\n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n The low prevalence of feline leishmaniasis in endemic areas could be due to under\u2010reporting or natural feline resistance to infection.\n8\n However, in endemic areas there is a high possibility of infection. Visceral forms are not usually described in feline leishmaniasis,\n5\n although some case reports of cutaneous manifestations have been published.\n4\n, \n5\n In some reports, feline leishmaniasis was related to natural acquired inmunodeficiency (FIV and FeLV infections),\n1\n although this association has not been confirmed. It is important to include leishmaniasis in the differential diagnosis of immunodeficient cats with systemic disease and polyclonal gammopathy. In our case, FIV and FeLV infection were ruled out, but as the patient was treated with glucocorticoids for 8 months, the immunological status may have been impaired.\n9\n\n",

Corneal epithelial cells, fibroblasts, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, some bacterias and possibly fungi produce an abnormal amount of proteases and collagenases that contributed to the progressive breakdown and rapid \u2018melting\u2019 of the corneal stroma.\n14\n In this case, histopathology confirmed the presence of a large number of Leishmania amastigotes and leukocytes in the corneal stroma. Collagenases could have been produced directly by Leishmania amastigotes or by polymorphonuclear corneal cells, although synthesis of collagenases by L. infantum has not been proven. To the authors\u2019 knowledge this is the second description of panuveitis due to feline leishmaniasis, but it is the first with associated melting keratitis. In endemic areas, leishmaniasis should be included in differential diagnosis of feline uveitis and corneal melting ulcers.",

In the case reported here, serum Leishmania titer was positive and bone marrow cytology and PCR techniques demonstrated Leishmania parasites, confirming visceral involvement. L. infantum has been described in some reports as the etiological agent of feline leishmaniasis.\n4\n, \n7\n Although Leishmania species could not be determined in this case, L. infantum was suspected, due to its endemicity in the Mediterranean basin\n1\n, \n13\n Some previous studies suggest the role of cats as potential peridomestic reservoirs for L. infantum in northeastern Spain.\n16\n In this report, ocular leishmaniasis was diagnosed by means of immunohistochemistry on ocular tissues examined after bilateral enucleation.",

This type of DM has been associated with hyperadrenocorticism, hyperthyroidism, excessive growth hormone secretion, chronic progesterone administration or exocrine pancreatic tumors.\n17\n In this case, DM could be the result of administering high doses of long\u2010acting glucocorticoids for several months. Insulin therapy and/or gradual tapering of glucocorticoid treatment allowed good control of blood glucose. Persistent hyperglycemia is an important factor in cats inducing glucose toxicity phenomena and inhibition of insulin synthesis or pancreatic secretion.\n18\n After starting insulin treatment and withdrawal of glucocorticoids, secretion of insulin is re\u2010established and hypoglycemic crises can occur. In this case, hypoglycemia episodes occurred 2 months after the initiation of therapy, and insulin treatment was stopped without any further observed relapses.",

The serum Leishmania titer also decreased with the treatment. Interestingly, the serum titer along with the polyclonal gammopathy increased again after the owner stopped the medication.
