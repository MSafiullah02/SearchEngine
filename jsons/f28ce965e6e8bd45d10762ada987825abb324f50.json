As increasing number of people rely on social media platforms for news, identifying misinformation has emerged as a critical task in these unprecedented times. In addition to being malicious, the spread of such information poses a serious public health risk. To this end, we design a dashboard to track misinformation on popular social media news sharing platform -Twitter. The dashboard provides visibility into the social media discussions around Coronavirus and the quality of information shared on the platform, updated over time. We collect streaming data using the Twitter API from March 1, 2020 to date and identify false, misleading and clickbait contents from collected Tweets. We provide analysis of user accounts and misinformation spread across countries. In addition, we provide analysis of public sentiments on intervention policies such as \"SocialDistancing\" and \"WorkFromHome\", and we track topics, and emerging hashtags and sentiments over countries. The dashboard maintains an evolving list of misinformation cascades, sentiments and emerging trends over time, accessible online at https://usc-melady.github.io/COVID-19-Tweet-Analysis.",

For instance, the line chart in Fig. 7 shows which hashtags emerged in terms of a slope of usage counts in the United States from March/22 to March/31. While the use of some hashtags (e.g., #coronavirus and #trump) continuously dominates the conversations, other hashtags (e.g., #coronalockdown, #coronavirustruth and #nationaldoctorsday) are temporally significant. The end of March is when most of states announced lockdown on many business and a stayat-home order, and it causes people to use lockdown-related hashtags (#coronalockdown). Moreover, it shows that people get more and more interested in facts on coronavirus. Finally, the slope-based extraction easily detects spike pattern of some hashtags (#nationaldoctorsday), which are only used in a particular day.",

The proportion of Twitter users in the United states is higher than in other countries like China with alternate social media platforms. Since the pandemic is at a global scale, social media analysis for other platforms and languages is critical towards curbing misinformation. The second important factor is that the annotation for misinformation is a challenging task and requires expert verification. Therefore, research in unsupervised or distant supervision are important towards alternate forms of labeling, to improve classification and handle the imbalance in the distribution of misinformation vs. legitimate information. We also plan to include social context information towards improving misinformation detection.",
