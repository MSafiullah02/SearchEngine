The first group of AEs can be considered consequent or associated to the pharmacological activity of the biomedicines, while the reactions caused by their immunogenicity are dependent mostly on the typical macromolecular, proteic structure of the agent, which acts as a strong foreign antigen promptly recognized by the recipient's immune system.",

Therefore, during biomedicines' development it resulted urgent and more feasible to reduce their immunogenicity by progressive humanization of the molecules, up to fully human protein sequencing and glycosylation, than trying to dissect the efficiency from adverse reactivity, the ''bonus'' from ''malus'' activity at clinical level. Humanization procedures sharply reduced immunogenicity, although they were neither able to abolish AEs, nor to avoid their most severe and life threatening expressions [1, 2] . In fact, even fully humanization could not produce ''stealth'' molecules, since their structure can be still recognized as an allogenic ''foreignness,'' yet able to induce sensitization of the recipient, and provoke hypersensitivity reactions of all types and severity.",

In this case the shortage of the half-life of the remaining Fab portion was compensated by coupling the remaining Fab fragment with PEG, leading to products with reasonable durability and a lower AEs potentiality. For example, certolizumab is a pegylated recombinant humanized Fab fragment (91 kD) composed of a single light and heavy chain derived from a murine IgG2a antibody, directed against soluble and transmembrane TNFa. The overall safety profile resulted more selective than other members of the same drug class. The absence of the Fc fragment avoided CDC and ADCCdependent reactions. However, the incidence of infections and in particular of granulomatous infections, including new cases or reactivation of TB, were not reduced, thus indicating their strict relation to the Fab-mediated portion of the molecule and very likely to the expressed mechanism of action. Abciximab is a smaller fragment (47.6 Da) consisting in a disulfide-linked dimer of an Fd heavy chain fragment and an intact light chain. It is directed against the CD41 integrin and inhibits platelet aggregation. The safety profile consisted in hemorrhagic complications, strictly related to its mechanism of action, but also to its immunogenicity, which caused ITCP.",

(B) AEs related to the immunogenicity of the molecule: They may occur as a consequence of hypersensitivity reactions triggered by the biomedicine recognition as a foreign complex of antigens, or by cross-link antigenicity with pre-existing antibodies or sensitized T cells. However, some peculiarities need to be underlined. Predictability of DRAEs is mainly assigned to Type A reactions, while unpredictable immune-related Type B reactions are usually restricted to predisposed individuals (see Table 2 .1).

Moreover, being biomedicines proteic structures with a relatively high molecular weight they have high immunogenic potential; Type B reactions are expected to be more relevant than for small chemical therapeutic molecules. The different degree of ''humanization'' easily proved the possibility of reducing such immunogenic potential and the consequent capacity of inducing AEs, although leaving large margins of variability. Therefore, a higher level of unpredictability in Type A and a higher frequency and variability in immune-related Type B than non-biological drugs are to be expected.

In attempting to depict a general safety profile it is useful to group the analyzed biomedicines according to their common target, as reported in Table 58 .1, which may help in better individuating shared AEs more strictly related to a similar mechanism of action.

Skin cancer, and in particular NMSC, is among the most represented epithelial induced neoplasm, followed by a number of other solid tumors. In some instances, peculiar types of neoplasms were apparently increased after treatment with specific biomedicines. For example, the risk for hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma was increased in IBD young patients treated with infliximab. Malignancies were also expected and observed after radiolabeled mAbs (Ibritumomab-tiuxetan-90 Yttrium; Iodine 131 tositumomab) treatment, including MDS, AML and a number of solid tumors, although rates were not particularly increased in long-term observations.

Oprelvekin safety profile consists of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, CLS and related fluid retention including pulmonary edema, dilution anemia, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, papilledema, and renal failure. Among serious events there are pyrexia and neutropenic pyrexia, syncope, atrial fibrillation and diarrhea, all consistently higher than in controls. New formulations of IL-11 are in progress with the aim of reducing AEs and preserve therapeutic efficacy. Among these, a genetically modified formulation showed in fact a lower incidence and a milder profile of undesirable events than the reference oprelvekin preparation. Recently, a potentiated IL-11 fusion protein (hyper IL-11) was developed, and showed to be more stable and effective at lower doses, thus promising to have a better risk/benefit balance.",

Palifermin, employed as systemic treatment, induces also frequent signs of skin and mucosal toxicity.
