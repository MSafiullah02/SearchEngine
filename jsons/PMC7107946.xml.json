With use of modern diagnostic techniques, it is clear that the majority of exacerbations are of infectious origin (Table 1) [2]. Current estimates are that approximately one-quarter of exacerbations are of viral cause, one-quarter are bacterial in etiology, and one-quarter result from a combination of pathogens [12]. The cause of the exacerbation in the remaining 25% is unclear. Some episodes appear to be related to environmental or irritant exposures.",

            "text": "The viral and bacterial pathogens associated with exacerbations share several common characteristics. All have tropism for the upper airway in the healthy human host. The primary mode of transmission is human to human. They usually asymptomatically colonize the upper airway (above the glottis) or cause mild infections. In the patient without COPD, the innate defense mechanisms keep the lower airway sterile in spite of repeated inhalation and micro-aspiration of bacteria and viruses [2]. In the context of COPD, the innate lung defense system is damaged, with subsequent increased risk of microbial colonization that extends into the lower (subglottic) airway. Pathogen presence in the lower airway stimulates a host immune-inflammatory response in an attempt to eradicate the pathogens. The inflammatory response causes symptoms of an exacerbation and contributes to progressive airway damage. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the adaptive immune response that follows exacerbations is often not helpful because of strain-to-strain heterogeneity [13\u201314].",

With these techniques, \u22651 respiratory virus was associated with \u223c30% of exacerbations. In contrast, when the same patients with COPD were studied in stable periods, viral isolation or serologic conversion were found in <1%. A major drawback in these older studies and several recent studies is the reliance on nasopharyngeal (NP) samples for viral culture. There may be a discordance between the presence of virus in the NP and virus in the lower respiratory tract. The presence of virus and a specific 4-fold increase in antibody titer in convalescent serum samples is supportive evidence of infection. A positive serologic response could occur in a viral upper airway infection. Therefore, although earlier studies are supportive of a viral causation of exacerbations, it was presumed that the NP culture results are indicative of infection in the tracheobronchial tree and that an increase in antibody titer reflects lower, and not upper, airway infection.",

            "text": "Introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods in the 1990s ushered in a new wave of studies examining the viral causation of exacerbations of COPD [16\u201321]. These studies report the presence of viral nucleic acid in 30% - \u201360% of exacerbations. Beckham et al [22] found viruses by culture in 23.4% of 194 upper airway samples obtained from 2 studies of adults with respiratory illness, including exacerbations of COPD. When these samples were subjected to reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) viral nucleic acid detection, the viral yield increased to 41.8% [22]. In some of the studies with the highest rates of detection, a higher rate of detection in subsequent stable state samples was also seen [17, 19]. The spectrum of viral pathogens detected by the molecular techniques was similar to that seen by culture in earlier studies, with the exception of newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus [23]. The relative frequency of viruses also changed. Influenza was detected less often, and RSV was detected more often [24]. This redistribution could reflect the change in method of detection or changes in prevalence as a result of influenza vaccination. Of interest, detection of viral nucleic acid was higher using sputum as opposed to NP samples when both sites were simultaneously sampled [16, 25]. Sputum samples are considered to be more representative of lower airway infection than are nasopharyngeal samples, provided the samples meets the quality criteria of >25 leukocytes and <10 epithelial cells per low-power field.",

Should investigators conclude that the presence of viral nucleic acids, detected by PCR of sputum samples, implies (proves) infection by the virus? PCR can detect as few as 10\u2013100 copies of a target respiratory virus. Whether such low viral titers are of pathological significance is unclear. Borg et al [26] quantified respiratory syncytial virus in respiratory secretions with use of real-time RT-PCR in children with acute respiratory tract infection and adults with COPD [26]. The viral quantitation varied by 2000 fold (1.2 \u00d7 10 [7] vs 6.1 \u00d7 10 [3]) [26]. The viral titers were equally low in stable and exacerbated COPD. Is the PCR detecting dead or live virus, invasive disease, or prolonged asymptomatic shedding? Quantitation may help define invasive disease. Another limitation of PCR studies is the lack of immunological assays to determine the presence or absence of an antibody. Other markers of the host response might help. Papi et al [12] report sputum eosinophilia only when viruses are detected by PCR in sputum during an exacerbation. In other studies, increased levels of sputum IL-6 are reported using molecular detection of virus [20].",

Development of new antiviral drugs will spur the use of molecular diagnosis in the clinical setting. Before that happens, we need to ascertain the following in the research setting: is quantitative PCR, rather than qualitative PCR, necessary at the time of exacerbation to distinguish between extremely low titers of likely noninvasive virus and the higher concentrations seen with infection? Technically, are the performance characteristics of RT-PCR of sputum equivalent to those with NP aspirate samples? Are the immunologic clinical syndromes and inflammatory responses seen in exacerbations with viruses detected molecularly similar to those when the virus is detected by culture methods? How often is the RT-PCR detecting dead virus or nonreplicating virus? Are the results of PCR testing comparable in different laboratories?",

Bacteria colonize the tracheobronchial tree in stable COPD. Therefore, simply detecting bacteria in sputum samples from patients with COPD does not differentiate between colonization and infection, as was shown in early studies of the bacteriology of sputum in COPD [28\u201329]. However, by using molecular epidemiology, it is possible to differentiate between newly acquired strains and pre-existing colonizing strains of bacterial pathogens. There is a clear relationship between the acquisition of new strains and exacerbations of COPD [30]. Furthermore, exacerbations with new strains are associated with mucosal and systemic immune response to the infecting strain and are strongly associated with a neutrophilic inflammatory profile in sputum [10, 13, 14, 31]. These studies clearly established nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as causative for a significant proportion of COPD exacerbations. All observations to date are based on the use of sputum cultures to identify the presence of bacterial infection.",

It is unclear whether this represents reinfection with the same NTHI strain or the possibility that the strain was never eliminated from sputum and the sputum culture was too insensitive to detect them. Adequacy of lower airway sampling was documented by measuring fibrinogen in culture-negative and -positive sputum samples. When molecular detection for NTHI, based on the PCR sequencing of the P2 gene was performed, NTHI was found in the culture-negative sputum samples in the gaps (Figure 1).

In the culture-negative sputum samples, molecular detection of the Opa gene of P. aeruginosa was present [31]. Therefore, sputum cultures are limited in their ability to detect bacterial pathogens in stable COPD. Whether this limitation extends to exacerbations of COPD has not been systematically examined. These observations are consistent with data in other respiratory infections, such as otitis media and pneumonia; detection of bacteria, such as NTHI, M. catarrhalis, and S. pneumonia, is enhanced by the use of molecular detection for the same bacteria.",

They also used the ply gene for S. pneumoniae and the p6 gene for NTHI, both of which are known to lack specificity for these pathogens.",

If rapid, inexpensive, validated techniques for molecular detection of bacteria were available, they would be clinically embraced with enhanced stewardship of antibiotic use. However, as with viral detection, several questions arise. How can a positive PCR result separate colonization from infection? Is there a quantitative threshold that defines infection? Is the airway and systemic inflammatory profile of exacerbations in which pathogens are detected by molecular techniques only similar to that seen when bacteria are detected by culture? Is detection by molecular methods associated with immune responses similar to those seen with bacteria isolated by culture?",

This difficulty can be surmounted by PCR sequencing of selected genes that are heterogeneous between strains of a species, such as the P2 gene of NTHI [32]. However, that would increase the complexity and turn-around time of molecular detection. Determination of specific antibody response after exacerbation is best done with the homologous strain. This can be circumvented by the use of pooled heterologous strains as the test antigen. Finally, there is no isolate for antibiotic susceptibility testing. For some organisms, it is possible to test for the gene responsible for antibiotic resistance.",
