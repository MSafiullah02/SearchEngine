Moist or semimoist diets may predispose these animals to dental calculi and periodontal disease.30 Most ferrets, even on a dry diet, develop tartar that progresses with age. Tartar tends to accumulate most heavily on the second and third upper premolars. Biting and gnawing habits often result in discoloration, wearing, and breaking of the tips of the canine teeth (Fig. 3-1\n). Broken canine teeth do not usually result in obvious discomfort or pain unless the dental pulp is exposed. Root canal restoration or surgical removal of the affected teeth may be necessary in some ferrets.33 Tooth root abscesses are not common but can occur at any age.",

Administration of a GI motility enhancer such as metoclopramide (0.2-1 mg/kg q6-8h PO or SC) (Reglan, AH Robins Company, Inc., Richmond, VA) may be helpful. Cisapride, which until recently was marketed for gastroesophageal reflux and gastroparesis in humans, reduces the frequency of regurgitation in dogs with megaesophagus when it is given at 0.5 mg/kg q8-24h PO.55 However, this drug is no longer available commercially in the United States because of adverse cardiac effects in humans.

Environmental and nutritional stress factors appear to play a role in resistance of infected animals to clinical disease. L. intracellularis is probably transmitted by the oral-fecal route,18 and it may be assumed that all ferrets that are housed in groups will be equally exposed to the agent. However, clinical disease develops in only a small percentage (usually 1%-3%) of group-housed juvenile ferrets. Improvements in the quality of care and nutrition of pet ferrets may be responsible for the apparently decreasing incidence of PBD in recent years.",

If the ferret is treated for only one disease when it has both, the time required for recognizing treatment failure may be the factor that ultimately decides if the ferret will survive. Unfortunately, the effective drugs used for treatment of the two diseases are different, and therapy necessitates multiple daily doses of several drugs for at least 2 weeks. Because the gut flora of ferrets is very simple and plays no vital role in digestion, long-term administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics does not cause diarrhea in ferrets as it does in most animals. Emaciated animals that die despite proper treatment usually have either very extensive gastric ulcers or severe ileitis, each of which drastically reduces the absorption of essential nutrients. Age of the animal may help in the differential diagnosis; young ferrets are more likely to develop PBD, whereas older ferrets can develop severe, chronic gastritis associated with H. mustelae infection.24 Also, H. mustelae\u2013 associated disease is more often associated with stress factors common in mature pet ferrets, such as concurrent disease or surgery (see Table 3-1).",

Some animals refuse to eat their regular diet of dry pellets but do accept the same food mixed with water and heated in a microwave until it develops a porridge-like consistency. Some ferrets eat meat baby foods, especially liver and chicken, and most drink milk. Milk causes loose stool in normal ferrets and in those with colitis, but it is very palatable. If milk fat is increased to 10% to 20% with cream, it appears to be absorbed well and contributes to weight gain even though diarrhea continues. Most sick ferrets accept Nutri-Cal (Tomlyn, Buena, NJ) at numerous times during the day. Many ferrets like the human food supplements such as Ensure Plus (Abbott Laboratories, Ross Products Division, Columbus, OH), Boost Plus (formerly Sustacal; Bristol Myers, Evansville, IN), or Isocal HN (Mead Johnston, Evansville, IN), and they sometimes eat softened pellets mixed with one of these products when they refuse pellets alone. Alternatively, offer nutritional recovery foods such as Maximum-Calorie (The Iams Company, Dayton, OH) or Canine a/d (Hill's Pet Nutrition); most sick ferrets accept these foods readily. Nutritional recovery diets such as Max-Cal can be used as the sole source of nutrition for weeks at a time if necessary. When using these diets, calculate a minimum daily intake of 400 kcal per kilogram of body weight. Sick ferrets may not make the effort to get up and drink from a water bottle but do usually drink from a dish. Offer fresh food and water by hand several times daily during hospitalization and home care; ferrets often take a few mouthfuls of every new offering but never go back for more. The first 2 days are critical for an animal that has lost 40% to 50% of its body weight, and intensive supportive care is essential.",
