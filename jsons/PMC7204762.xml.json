In a letter to the editor of Chest, Xu, Barth and Buja raised a call to action, specifically for as many autopsies to be done as soon as possible to determine the pathologic substrate of this disease [7]. This is based on the well documented importance of the autopsy in establishing the etiology, pathogenesis and response to treatment of emerging diseases [8].",

Specifically, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) initially issued a contradictory statement with one sentence recommending suspension of post mortem procedures in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and a second sentence indicating that, if deemed necessary and appropriate, strict adherence to basic safety procedures be used while performing such autopsies. In a subsequent statement from OSHA the first sentence was dropped [9]. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued extensive guidelines which included rigorous standards for morgues and autopsy facilities to be under negative pressure with specific standards for venting the air from the rooms [10]. There followed a spectrum of administrative responses to the OSHA and CDC directives. But the overall effect has been to create more than necessary impediments for the task before us. Of note and particular relevance for the autopsy situation, Dr. Patricia Harris, President of the American Medical Association, has issued an important statement defending science in a time of fear and uncertainty [11].",

It varies from state to state and from county to county. There are statewide, county, and regional systems that have substantial differences in their medicolegal jurisdiction. These considerations will determine the extent of COVID-19 autopsies in medical examiner jurisdictions around the country.

With disease progression, more areas of consolidation are seen that can progress to diffuse multifocal airspace disease as seen with DAD and ARDS [46], [47], [48], [49], [50]. Imaging patterns that suggest an alternative diagnosis include a lobar pattern of consolidation, discrete pulmonary micronodules, pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy. Although the bilateral peripheral distribution of opacities is considered to be characteristic of COVID-19, other viral pneumonias, including those produced by certain strains of influenza, also can have a bilateral distribution of radiographic findings [51,52].",

The 5 other patients who died after about 20 days of symptoms had the histological pattern of AFOP. Correlation with pathophysiological showed that the first patient had a type L pattern of low pulmonary elastance whereas the other 5 patients had a type H pattern of high pulmonary elastance. Our patient who died after a 10-14-day course had a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis with intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and no hyaline membranes or foci of organizing pneumonia. This pattern may represent a transition from the DAD to the AFOP patterns. Interstitial pneumonitis with DAD and AFOP patterns has been described in the original SARS disease. Going forward, more extensive and detailed correlation of the clinical, imaging and pathological changes of the pulmonary component of COVID-19 is needed.",

Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) demonstrated low-grade myocardial inflammation and viral particles in the myocardial interstitial cells but not in cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells [65]. The ultrastructural study demonstrated single or small groups of viral particles with the morphology (dense round viral envelope and electron-dense spike-like structures on their surface) and size (variable between 70 and 120 nm) of coronaviruses [66]. The authors interpreted the findings as evidence of direct involvement of the myocardium during a viremic phase or migration of infected macrophages from the lung. Grimes et al. demonstrated 60 to 120 nm \u201cviral-like\u201d particles in distended cytoplasmic vacuoles within pneumocytes as well as rupture of the cytoplasmic vacuoles with release of the virus-like particles into the alveolar lumen [18]. The individual spherical viral-like particles had distinctive projections with mature particles exhibiting electron dense centers, consistent with the appearance of coronaviruses.",

[19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Grimes et al. point out that several viral infections have been associated with coagulation disorders that may lead to thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [18]. Both influenza virus and SARS have been associated with pulmonary intravascular thrombi formation and fibrin deposition likely as a result of DIC and microthrombosis. In SARS coronavirus infection, increased production of a novel pro-coagulant by infected cells due to increased hfg12 gene transcription induced by viral nucleocapsid (N) protein has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to thrombosis [18,78].",

We also observed entrapment of neutrophils in capillaries and fibrin deposits within and outside of capillaries. We concur with the suggestion of Fox et al that an important pathogenic mechanism of fatal COVID-19 disease is a thrombotic microangiopathy primarily involving the lungs. Variation in the demonstration of microthombi in the lungs may relate to the stage of the coagulopathy at the time of death. In DIC, microthrombi are found in multiple organs in relationship to the peak of clot formation but may not be found when the DIC has progressed to depletion of clotting factors and activation of fibrinolysis [79], [80], [81], [82], [83].",
