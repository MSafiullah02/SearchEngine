Recently, the large 386-nucleotide deletion (L386del) comprising nucleotide positions 27719-28104 and spanning open reading frames 9-11 has been reported in the genomes of some human isolates from Hong Kong. In this study, archived specimens from 71 patients with SARS who were admitted to the New Territory East Cluster Hospitals in Hong Kong were analyzed to determine whether the L386del variant of SARS-CoV was present. There was no clear relationship between the presence of the L386del variant and SARS clinical severity as defined either by the need for intensive-care therapy and/or ventilation or by death. One patient had evidence of both the L386del variant and the wild-type variant in the same clinical specimen, supporting the idea that SARS-CoV exists as a quasispecies in some patients, although the clinical significance of these quasispecies remains unclear.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Since the worldwide SARS epidemic in 2003, many studies have focused on the genomics of the SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), to understand more about the pathogenic potential of this new pathogen. Several significant differences between the various SARS-CoV isolates from different patients and animal hosts have now been identified. Guan et al. [1] found that the majority of human SARS-CoV associated with the epidemic had a 29-nt deletion spanning open reading frames (ORFs) 10 and 11 (in Guan et al.'s original nomenclature), compared with the SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) identified in Himalayan palm civet cats (Paguma larvata) from a Guangdong live-animal market; this 29nt deletion in the human SARS-CoV genome comprised nucleotide positions (np) 27869-27897 when that ge-nome was aligned with the TOR-2 SARS-CoV reference sequence (GenBank accession no. NC004718). The functional significance of this deletion is uncertain, although it may represent an adaptive mutation to a human host by SARS-CoV from a potential civet-cat animal reservoir [1, 2] . However, it has been reported that the human-adapted SARS-CoV with the 29-nt deletion remains just as able to infect the civet cat [3] . Other studies have suggested that bats may be an alternative animal reservoir for SARS-CoV [4, 5] , which suggests that the civet cat is a secondary, amplifying host for SARS-CoV rather than the primary reservoir. The bat SL-CoV also has the additional 29 nt in ORFs 10 and 11 and, in this respect, is similar to the civet-cat SL-CoV [4, 5] . Most recently, experiments have shown that replacement of this 29-nt deletion does not alter the in vitro or in vivo replication, persistence, or duration of the viral load in the murine model, although this finding does not exclude the possibility that there could be more-dramatic effects if a civet-cat or raccoon-dog model were used [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 355, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1063, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1066, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1203, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1300, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1301, "end": 1303, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1540, "end": 1543, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1546, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1889, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Other deletions have been noted in other areas of the SARS-CoV genome.

These 2 genotypes had also been isolated from animals in Guangdong and other provinces (e.g., Hubei) in China. The authors of that study also noted that these 2 genotypes were not restricted to the early part of the epidemic but were isolated during the middle phase as well; in addition, they reported the presence, during the late phase of the epidemic, of a third genotype, characterized by a 415-nt deletion resulting in the loss of ORF 8.

Furthermore, be-P p .1 cause of the retrospective nature of the present study, it was not able to control for all possible confounding factors, such as variation in the number and nature of examined specimens from the patients, the timing of the collection of the specimens, and the treatment regimen used. At a population level, the L386del variant appeared soon after the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and became dominant toward the end of this outbreak. This observation is in keeping with the hypothesis that the L386del variant has adapted to human infection and is being transmitted as efficiently as-or even more efficiently than-the wild-type variant.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The present study has shown that, at any given time, both the L386del variant and the wild-type variant can be present within the same clinical specimen of a patient, an example being patient F in the present study; and this finding provides evidence that SARS-CoV evolves rapidly within the same host and, therefore, may exist as a quasispecies. The results observed in patient F are also consistent with what has been observed at the population level, where the L386del variant was found to have appeared during the course of the SARS outbreak and to have become dominant toward the end of this outbreak. The L386del variant disrupts or completely eliminates ORFs 9 (np 27638-27772), 10 (np 27779-27898), and 11 (np 27864-28118). The functions of these ORFs remain unknown. An earlier report on the SARS-CoV genome [13] predicted that ORFs 9, 10, and 11 would code for proteins comprising 44, 39, and 84 aa, respectively. That report also noted that ORF 9 was comparable to a putative sterol-C5 desaturase and a Clostridium perfringens protein but that ORF 10 was not comparable to any known proteins listed in public databases. The structure predicted for ORFs 9 and 10 was a single transmembrane helix, and that for ORF 11 was a soluble protein; the latter showed a slight match to the human coronavirus S glycoprotein precursor [13] . More recently, Li et al. [14] have suggested that ORF 10 may play a role by impairing the oxidoreductase system in the mitochondria of SARS-CoV-infected host cells, and those authors therefore have hypothesized that the clinical effects of SARS-CoV infection in humans may be due to a direct cytopathic effect of the virus, rather than to virus-induced immunopathological damage. A study of 33 complete SARS-CoV genomes [15] found that ORF 10 had the highest point-mutation rate, a rate that was higher than that in parts of the replicase, S, and N genes; because this high mutation rate has also been reported for a similar region (ORF 10 ) in the SL-CoVs recently isolated from 3 species of horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) [4] , ORF 10 seems to be present in human and other mammalian SARS-CoV and SL-CoV species, although its function remains unknown. In both the human and civet-cat host, it is unclear whether the reported deletions in the various ORFs of the SARS-CoV genome have any significant clinical consequence; however, at least 1 of them, the 29-nt deletion, was considered to be a marker of a human-host origin when it was found in SARS-CoV isolated from a pig [16] . Therefore, at present, the region covered by ORFs 10 and 11 would seem to be useful as a genetic marker of a possible animal origin of SARS-CoV, rather than as a therapeutic or vaccine targetin contrast to its structural counterparts, such as the S gene (ORF 2) [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 817, "end": 821, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1337, "text":
