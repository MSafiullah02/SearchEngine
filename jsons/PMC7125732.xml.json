RESLES is a clinico-radiological syndrome characterized by seizures, encephalopathy, headache and ataxia among others. It has been associated with several etiologies such as infections, metabolic, vascular, demyelinating diseases and sudden withdrawal of the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (Doherty et al., 2005; Garcia-Monco et al., 2011; Garg et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2016). Classically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows reversible lesions on SCC with restricted diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value (Doherty et al., 2005; Garcia-Monco et al., 2011; Garg et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2016). The aim of this report was to evaluate the clinico-radiological characteristics of a patient with RESLES in Argentina and to perform a brief review.",

One day later, she had an episode of involuntary tonic movements in all four limbs, which lasted a few minutes, without loss of consciousness (LC). During hospitalization, she had two new episodes. During the first new episode, she had a left-gaze deviation and encephalopathy for a few minutes, without postictal state (PS). In the second episode, she presented tonic movements in all four limbs followed by dysarthria, but resolved within a few minutes, without LC or PS. Physical examination was normal. At disease onset, routine investigations on serum were all normal, except for the presence of leukopenia (3580 cells/microL) and a mild elevation in both aspartate transaminase (AST, 89 UI/L [normal = 5-35]) and alanine transaminase (ALT, 121 UI/L [normal = 6-35]). Laboratory test performed the day after revealed normal liver enzymes and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase. In this context, she denied alcohol or illicit drug abuse but a naproxen intake prior to the laboratory test was indicated during admission, which is described as a cause of transient increase in liver enzymes. However, her seizures did not improve at onset. Viral serologies were performed and results were negative for influenza A and B, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, enterovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and all types of herpes viruses (herpes virus simplex 1 and 2, Epstein-Barr, Varicela Zoster, cytomegalovirus and herpes 6). In addition, antibody results for lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, celiac disease, neuromyelielitis optica (aquaporin-4 antibody) as well as paraneoplastic syndrome (anti-Hu, anti-Yo and anti-Ri) were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed normal cell count, glucose concentration and total protein concentration as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing negative for all types of herpes viruses. Oligoclonal bands were also negative on CSF. Blood cultures were all negative including those for mycoplasma pneumoniae.",

            "text": "Encephalopathy has been defined as acute brain impairment such as fever, headache, behavior disorder, seizures and impairment of consciousness without evidence of inflammatory changes on serum or CSF (Zhu et al., 2016). If the patients present with febrile syndrome and inflammatory changes, they are called to have encephalitis (Zhu et al., 2016). Two classifications of acute encephalopathy were reported (Hoshino et al., 2012). The first was based on the microorganism that can cause the infectious process whereas the second was based on clinical, laboratory, MRI scan and pathological findings of encephalopathy (Hoshino et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2016). In our patient, the diagnosis was RESLES associated with MERS related to self-limited respiratory illness. Thus, the infectious-related clinically MERS was reported as the most frequent cause of RESLES in childhood (Zhu et al., 2016). In addition, some cases of RESLES (13 patients) have been published in adults from Japan, India, Hong Kong, China, United States and Turkey (Hoshino et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2016). In 2012, the diagnostic criteria for MERS were reported according to Hoshino et al (Hoshino et al., 2012). as follows: 1) Onset with neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as abnormal speech and/or behavior, and impaired consciousness and convulsion, within 1 week after fever onset; 2) Complete recovery without sequelae, mostly within 10 days after the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms; 3) Hyperintensity lesion in the SCC, in the acute stage. T1 and T2 signal changes are mild; 4) Lesion may involve the entire corpus callosum and the cerebral white matter in a symmetric fashion; 5) Lesion disappears within 1 week, with no residual signal changes or atrophy.",

Thus, brain MRI is the best tool available to differentiate lesions of the SCC. Transient SCC lesions with restricted DWI and ADC reduction on brain MRI can differentiate RESLES from ischemia. This pattern on brain MRI indicates the presence of cytotoxic edema in the SCC. Likewise, reduced ADC value might be explained by intramyelinic edema, transient inflammatory infiltrate and/or interstitial edema in tightly packed fibers. Usually, these lesions resolve completely on follow-up imaging (1-2 weeks) (Doherty et al., 2005; Garg et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2015).",
