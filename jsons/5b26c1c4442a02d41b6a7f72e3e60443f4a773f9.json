            "text": "The effects of route of administration on systemic and gut mucosal immune responses induced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection in suckling pigs were investigated. Twenty-four conventional 5-dayold suckling piglets were randomly divided into four groups and were inoculated orally, intranasally (I.N.), intramuscularly (I.M.) with PEDV or DMEM (mock). Pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs and fecal viral load. Blood samples were collected at 7, 14, 21 days post infection (dpi) and subjected for the analyses of serum antibody production, T cell and natural killer (NK) cell frequencies, NK cytotoxicity and serum cytokine levels. Oral inoculation led to higher levels of PEDV-specific IgA antibodies in both serum and gut mucosal sites than did other routes of inoculation. Intranasal inoculation elicited significantly higher titers of virus-specific IgG antibodies in serum. PEDV-infected pigs regardless of inoculation routes had significantly lower NK cell frequencies than those of the control pigs at 14 dpi. The orally inoculated pigs had significantly higher CD3+CD8+ T cell frequencies as compared to I.N. or I.M. inoculated pigs at 14 dpi, while there was no significant difference among orally, I.N. or I.M. inoculated pigs and control pigs in CD3+CD4+ T cell frequencies in peripheral blood. PEDV-infected and control pigs had low, but detectable NK cell activities at 14 and 21 dpi, however, NK cell activities were barely detectable at 7 dpi whether the pigs were infected or not. Serum IL-10 levels were induced drastically in orally infected pigs at 7 dpi and then gradually declined. Serum IL-12 levels followed a similar pattern while the fold-change was much lower. In conclusion, oral inoculation may generate more comprehensive immune responses.",

Innate immunity is the initial response to prevent, control, or eliminate viral infection and stimulates and influences the types of adaptive immune responses that develop (Akira et al., 2006) . Natural killer (NK) cells, the first and best described innate lymphoid cells, play important roles in innate immune responses. The effector functions of NK cells are to kill infected cells and to produce interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) . NK cells may also be important later in the course of viral infection by killing infected cells that have https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.vetmic.2018.11 .019 Received 30 August 2018; Received in revised form 15 November 2018; Accepted 19 November 2018 escaped cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune attack by reducing expression of class I MHC molecules (Lam and Lanier, 2017) .

Vero E6 cells were infected with PEDV ZJ15XS0101 isolate or mock-infected, cells were examined by IFA using PEDV-S1-specific monoclonal antibody at 16 h post infection (A and B, scale bar, 100 \u03bcm). C: one-step growth curve of P120, P35 and P16 in Vero E6 cells. Cells were infected with P120, P35 or P16 at a MOI of 0.01, culture supernatant and cells were harvested at 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hpi. The viral titration was determined according to the Reed and Muench method and expressed as TCID 50 /ml. D: Schematic representation of mutations in the S protein of the parent, 16th-, 35th-, and 120th-passaged ZJ15XS0101. 2 . A: Fecal consistency score. After PEDV inoculation, piglets were monitored for clinical signs every day until necropsy. Diarrhea was assessed by scoring fecal consistency. Appearance and consistency of feces were recorded and assigned to a score as follows: 0 = normal; 1 = mild fluidic feces; 2 = moderate watery feces; 3 = severe watery and projectile diarrhea, with scores of 1 or more considered diarrheic. B: Significantly higher fecal viral shedding in orally inoculated piglets. Fecal shedding PEDV RNA titers were determined by qRT-PCR. The detection limit of qRT-PCR was 3.3 log 10 RNA copies per \u03bcl of rectal swab fluid. Data are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM. Fig. 3 . Pathological examination. Small (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) and large (cecum and colon) intestinal tissues and other major organs were examined grossly at 7, 14, and 21 dpi.",

            "text": "The aim of the study is to investigate the immune responses to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection in suckling pigs by different routes. Porcine epidemic diarrhea is an acute viral enteric infection that results in high mortality and morbidity in suckling pigs . The fecal-oral route is the main route of PEDV transmission (Crawford et al., 2015) , and airborne transmission is also considered a potential route for PEDV dissemination (Alonso et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018) . Therefore, induction of localized immune responses at these mucosal sites is important in preventing disease (Neutra and Kozlowski, 2006) . Several studies have shown that the degree of protection against various viral infections correlates better with the level of secretory than with serum antibodies (Gould et al., 2017; Habibi et al., 2015) . Intramuscular injection is the most common route used in vaccination. However, this route usually does not induce immune response in the external secretions that bathe the mucosal membranes, the most common sites of entry of infectious agents. A more effective route that results in a generalized immune response manifested by the parallel appearance of specific antibodies in several external secretions, involves ingestion or inhalation of antigens.",

In our study, the 120th passage virus were cell-culture adapted compared to the earlier passages, and the viral titers of the 16th, 35th and 120th passage virus were continuously increasing. The nucleotide and amino acid changes of P120 may contribute to the cell culture adaption of the strain. In the virulence experiment, the 16th-passaged virus caused watery diarrhea and high mortality rate in pigs, while the P120-infected pigs showed only mild diarrhea and recovered in a few days. There were no gross lesions evident in any PEDV-inoculated pigs. These results indicated that the 120th-passaged virus was attenuated. In orally inoculated piglets, three piglets showed mild signs of diarrhea in two or three days after inoculation, and the signs seemed to be transient. The diarrhea coincided with the viral load in the feces, and orally infected pigs continued to shed virus for the next few days. All intranasally exposed piglets shed mild fluidic feces starting at 2 dpi, the syndrome lasted for 2 days and all piglets recovered in the next 2-3 days. The viral load peaked at 3 dpi and became undetectable in I.N. group. We observed about one day delay in viral shedding and onset of diarrhea in I.N. inoculated group as compared with the orally inoculated group. This is in general agreement with a recent paper (Li et al., 2018) , which showed that PEDV could cause typical diarrhea in piglets through a nasal spray and illustrated the mechanism of its transport from the entry site via systemic route by T cells carrying the viral pathogen to the intestines where the infection occurs. In their model, the intranasally inoculated piglets began to exhibit typical PEDV symptoms at 60 hpi, about 14 h later than orally inoculated piglets. They detected viral RNA in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum at 24 hpi, but not before (3 or 12 hpi) in intranasally inoculated piglets. This delay represents the time required by the host cells to transfer the virus to the intestines through the blood circulation. In intramuscularly infected group, however, the diarrhea lasted for 4 days. It is interesting that fecal viral RNA copies were undetectable, so the diarrhea may partly be attributed to the stress caused by injection.",

In accordance with the profiles of antibodies secreted in serum and feces, the jejunal contents of orally inoculated pigs showed remarkable increased IgA antibodies at 21 dpi.

IL-10 is an inhibitor of activated macrophages and dendritic cells and is thus involved in control of innate immune reactions and cell-mediated immunity. IL-10 can inhibit the production of many cytokines including interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-12. IL-12 is secreted by Fig. 7 . Serum cytokine profiles of PEDV-inoculated pigs via oral, intranasal, or intramuscular route or control pigs at 7, 14 and 21 dpi. Blood samples were collected at indicated time points and separated sera were frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until assayed. The assay of IL-12 (A), IL-10 (B), IL-17 (C), IL-8 (D), IFN-\u03b3 (E), and TNF\u03b1 (F) was performed by using commercial kits. Data are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM (*P < 0.05 and ****P < 0.0001). dendritic cells and macrophages and stimulates IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells and T cells, enhances NK cell and CTL-mediated cytotoxicity (Saraiva and O'garra, 2010) . Both serum IL-10 and IL-12 levels were elevated in orally inoculated pig and the pattern of production was similar, peaking at 7dpi and declining thereafter. The fold-change of IL-10 level was drastic. A study showed that IL-10 secretion did not change in both CV-777 infected immature and mature dendritic cells in vitro, while IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 secretions were significantly induced (Gao et al., 2015) . The discrepancy may be due to the different strains and experimental conditions. Given the fact that IL-10 can decrease anti-viral associated IFN-\u03b3 production, it is possible that the secretion of IL-10 could have substantially diminished the ability of the cells spontaneously secreting IFN-\u03b3 to mediate protective immunity against the virus.",
