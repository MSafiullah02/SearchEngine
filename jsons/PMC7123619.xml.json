Anti-vaccination movements have been active since the introduction of the smallpox vaccine and government-mandated vaccination. In the U.S. and U.K., opponents to vaccination have often been religious. Arguments against variolation, and later vaccination, go back to the eighteenth century, even before Jenner and his discovery of cowpox as protection against smallpox. Preachers pronounced diseases as punishment for sins, and as such should not be treated. A national poll conducted between 2005 and 2010 showed that 60 % of Americans did not want to get flu shots since they worried about side effects and over-vaccination of the population. Recent opposition stems from a report in The\nLancet in 1998, linking the measles mumps, and rubella vaccine to the onset of autism. This paper was later withdrawn following the exposure of fabricated data, but the measles vaccine program in the U.K., and to a lesser degree in the U.S., was severely damaged.",

To summarize: Dr. Edward Jenner (1749\u20131823), a practicing physician in Berkeley, England (Gloucestershire), had noted, as had others, that milkmaids appeared to be immune to smallpox. Instead, their hands often had blisters picked up from cows who had developed pocks on their teats, later shown to be caused by the cowpox virus (later called \u201cvaccinia\u201d). Jenner, who had a small laboratory in the shadows of Berkeley Castle and its torture chambers in Northern England, inoculated a number of children, including his 11-month-old son first with cowpox, and then reported protection against smallpox. Over 100,000 people had been vaccinated worldwide by the year 1800. Most physicians accepted Jenner\u2019s vaccine, although there was some resentment against Jenner by other physicians who did not appreciate that the \u201ccure\u201d for smallpox was developed by a country physician. Others may have resented the loss of revenue from treating smallpox [1]. In 1802, the British Parliament discussed Jenner\u2019s vaccine, upheld its usefulness and his claim that he was the inventor of the method. Despite its success, and its use worldwide, there continued to be opposition to the vaccine.",

The virus was unstable over long periods and could not be shipped long distances. It could be kept in dry storage for a few months but could not tolerate heat or exposure to the sun.

The British government passed the vaccination act in 1840, after a smallpox epidemic from 1837 until 1840, made variolation illegal and supplied smallpox vaccine (cowpox) free of charge. In 1853 the Vaccination Act was passed, requiring all children to receive smallpox vaccines by the age of 4 months; later on, the law was changed to allow parents who objected to vaccination to appeal. This was known as the conscientious objection law, hence the term \u201cconscientious objector.\u201d In 1905 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states could impose mandatory vaccination on children.",

Pasteur consulted with two physicians, and since there seemed little hope of a cure since rabies is fatal, asked one of the physicians to administer the untested vaccine. Using it on Meister has come into some criticism and controversy in recent years [3] with the release of Pasteur\u2019s notebooks. Questions are being asked whether the vaccine was adequately tested before being used in the Meister case, and doubts have been expressed as to whether the boy had been bitten by a rabid dog. Both Pasteur and Roux worked on the vaccine, but Roux\u2019s name is not on the paper reporting the treatment of Meister.

While in Ecuador, Noguchi claimed to have discovered the agent causing yellow fever, a spirochete bacterium, Leptospira icteroides [5]. He went on to develop a vaccine from this organism and used it extensively in South America and Africa. Noguchi published many papers reporting success with his vaccine, in a total of 7,964 cases. However, his results were not reproducible, filters retained the agent he used, indicating that it was not a viral disease, the statistics were faulty, and eventually the Rockefeller Institute dropped the project.

Noguchi also contracted yellow fever and died in May 1928, as did a third investigator, who performed the autopsy on him [6].

In 1927 he isolated a virus that appeared to be the causative agent of the disease. Being aware of the previous literature on the rabies virus, and on recent work on growing herpes virus in the brain of mice, Theiler inoculated the yellow fever virus into mouse brains and found that it reproduced. When injected into rhesus monkeys, the passaged virus was less pathogenic systemically, but more neurotropic. This research was extremely dangerous. The Rockefeller Institute announced in 1931 that there had been 32 cases of yellow fever in eight laboratories, with five fatalities. The French strain, passaged a hundred more times in mouse brains, was administered to protect laboratory and field workers in 1931. The virus was combined with immune serum from yellow fever-infected lab workers to prevent encephalitis. This vaccine was successful and was used up until World War II. Meanwhile, the French scientists developed a different vaccine, using the mouse brain passaged virus, coating it with oil or egg yolk, freeze-drying the mixture, suspending it in saline, and applying it with the smallpox vaccine by scarification. By 1945, sixteen million Africans had been vaccinated with this combination and with few side effects.",

This virus lost its neurotropism in mice, due to random mutations. This strain, called 17D, had no side effects, and became the vaccine of choice. By 1939, 1.3 million people had been vaccinated in South America with the Theiler vaccine, without any side effects. However, in 1941, 119 cases of encephalitis were reported, all of the infected having received the vaccine from a single lot; this virus had apparently mutated during sub-culture.

A major advance was the discovery that both poliovirus and mumps virus could grow in mouse lung cells. Three major research groups were involved in the development of a polio vaccine: those of Jonas Salk, Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski. Unfortunately, there was bitter competition and rivalry between the three groups. The first vaccine licensed in the U.S. was Salk\u2019s inactivated polio vaccine (1955), in which the three strains of poliovirus were inactivated by treatment with formalin. The development of this vaccine was a great achievement, and Jonas Salk became a national hero. A second attenuated vaccine containing all three strains of polio was tested and licensed in 1962. Two other groups had independently produced an attenuated vaccine\u2014one headed by Albert Sabin, the other by Hilary Koprowski. A committee of the National Institutes of Health decided on the Sabin vaccine, which consisted of the three mutated strains of polio, extensively passaged in cell culture and mice. Hilary Koprowski had developed the first attenuated poliovirus in 1950 and tested it on himself and on a group of 20 children in New York, with no side effects. Mass vaccination trials of the Koprowski oral polio vaccine took place in the Belgian Congo, Poland, Croatia, and Switzerland. By 1960, approximately 13 million individuals had been vaccinated with the Koprowski polio vaccine and over 11 million with the Sabin vaccine [7].",

Initially, the Salk vaccine was the vaccine of choice in the U.S. In 1955, in the largest trial ever held, more than 400,000 children were vaccinated with the Salk vaccine, which was 90 % effective against type II and type III polio, and 60\u201370 % effective against type I. Large industrial facilities were built for the production of the vaccine, which was exported to many countries. In 1955, in an event known as the \u201cCutter\u201d (Cutter was the name of one of the pharmaceutical companies that produced the polio vaccine), some 120,000 doses of the Salk vaccine were created, containing a live poliovirus instead of an inactive one. The administration of this vaccine caused 40,000 cases of polio, with 53 cases of paralysis and 5 deaths. The disease spread, creating a polio epidemic that lead to a further 113 cases of paralytic polio and another 5 deaths.

It was also assumed that the immunity from the inactivated vaccine would not be long lasting, whereas the Sabin vaccine virus multiplied in the gut, and would confer a stronger immune response. By 1968 the Sabin vaccine replaced the Salk vaccine. Since it was given orally rather than by injection, it was easier for children to take and for parents to administer. However there was a low, but steady number of individuals receiving the vaccine who developed paralytic polio, indicating that the attenuated virus had undergone mutation, or reverted to wild-type. By 2000 the US CDC recommended the Salk, inactivated vaccine. In the WHO campaign to eradicate polio, the oral vaccine is preferred, because of herd immunity.

This was based on a study headed by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon and specialist in diseases of the gastric tract. In particular, he claimed to have found a correlation between irritable bowel syndrome, autism and the vaccine. His conclusions were based on a study of 12 children. Most of the data presented in the paper was anecdotal, on information from the parents as to when the autistic symptoms first appeared. In most cases this was said to have been within a few weeks of the MMR inoculation. Dr. Wakefield published a follow-up series of papers [10\u201312] claiming a direct relationship between the vaccine and autism (and irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn\u2019s disease). The papers were peer-reviewed, many appearing in The\nLancet or other influential peer-reviewed journals. The major argument presented was that (1) the vaccine overloaded the immune system with viruses (three types), leading to an abnormal immune response; (2) the injection of measles virus at such a young age altered the normal immune response, resulting in aberrations of the immune system; and (3) that lack of natural exposure to these viruses could lead to irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn\u2019s disease, both autoimmune diseases (although also known to be inherited). These reports caused an uproar in the U.K., resulting in many parents refusing to vaccinate their children; the effects were such that the level of MMR vaccination dropped from 93 to 73 % in the U.K., and to 50 % in London.",

Similar retractions were made in other journals, but by then a great deal of damage had been done. During this period, Wakefield stood by his results and claimed that there was a conspiracy against him. What is astounding is that none of the co-authors on the original paper realized that the data was wrong (or not statistically correct) and that the retraction took so long. An investigation by the General Medical Council of Great Britain found that many of the co-authors could not identify which child was being discussed in the paper.

New methods of producing vaccines, in which reverse genetics is used to copy genes, which are inserted into plasmids, and then cloned back into a reference strains of influenza have been developed. New technologies are required to produce sufficient influenza vaccines, and some are already being tried in various companies. These include cell-based rather than egg-based live attenuated and inactive viral vaccines as well as recombinant protein vaccines, where the genes for HA and NA are cloned into baculovirus vectors and administered as purified proteins. Influenza virus gene can also be cloned into other viral vectors such as vaccinia virus or adenovirus and administered as either a replication-competent virus or defective virus (Fig. 19.4).

It sounds like science fiction, yet experimental trials of producing viral antigens are under way, both in the research laboratory and in biotech companies, by introducing animal viral genes into the plant genome, and into chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are small organelles of prokaryotic origin that are responsible for photosynthesis in green plants, analogous to mitochondria in higher organisms. Plant-derived vaccines (or other biopharmaceuticals) are cheap to produce (compared to cell culture) and to store, easy to scale up for mass production, and safer than those produced from other sources, since there is less likelihood of contamination by bacteria or even other viruses. Plant systems are much more economical than other industrial systems for producing vaccines and would be ideal for Third World countries. For example, it is estimated that to produce 100 million doses of influenza vaccine by a conventional pharmaceutical company, such as Sanofi in Pennsylvania, would cost $150 million per year. If Novartis were to produce 300 million doses, they would charge $100 billion. Using tobacco plants, the cost would be $15 million per year to produce one billion doses [14]. The technology is already available for the purification, if necessary, of the products, although the ultimate aim might be to digest the vaccine (oral vaccine), despite the fact that precautions need to be taken that the vaccine is not itself digested by stomach enzymes (this obviously does not apply to tobacco plants). To date, the yield of products in experimental systems such as tobacco or lettuce or grains has not been as great as expected; however, the yield can be greatly enhanced by cloning the desired viral genes into chloroplasts, which multiply in large numbers in the plant cell, thus enriching the product. An HSV-2 vaccine has been produced in soybeans using a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter [15]. This antibody was effective in preventing HSV-2 infection in a mouse model and was indistinguishable from a monoclonal antibody produced in cell culture. A whole series of monoclonal antibodies have been produced in a variety of plants using plant virus vectors [16]. The hepatitis B envelope protein has been produced in potatoes, lettuce, and lupines, and was immunogenic when digested orally. The Norwalk virus capsid protein was also produced in potatoes and tobacco plants and was immunogenic. The protein produced resembled empty viral capsids (Table 19.5).\n",
