Chongqing is located in a subtropical region; CHCMU is the largest children's hospital in southeastern China and serves the population of Sichuan Province and two neighboring provinces. ARD was determined on the basis of an acute disease onset with symptoms of cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, and a fever of more than 37.5\u00b0C. Children aged < 14 years who were admitted in respiratory clinics for ARD were recruited in this study. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected and subjected to a laboratory analysis. Severe pneumonia was defined as pneumonia plus hypoxemia (at a constant SaO2 < 92% in the air) or an increase in respiratory and pulse rates with clinical evidence of respiratory distress and exhaustion with or without an increase in PaCO2 concentrations.",

In the current study, a biennial HRV outbreak pattern that occurred during the winter and spring seasons was identified. Chongqing is a subtropical region in China, and the identified seasonal pattern was largely similar to the pattern of influenza that has been identified in other subtropical regions in China (unpublished data). The high circulation pattern in the winter and spring may be explained by meteorological variables, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Further study is warranted to investigate the relationship between meteorological parameters and HRV circulation in other regions. Different but interactive patterns of HRV-A and HRV-C circulation were identified. This temporal pattern of a high HRV-A peak followed by a low HRV-C peak could be attributed to the variation in magnitude of the susceptible population, which considerably diminished following a large outbreak of HRV-A, assuming that a cross protection exists among HRV genotypes.",

Previous studies have reported that HRV-C causes more severe clinical manifestations compared with the other HRV types21822. However, in this current study, we only identified an association between HRV-C and an increased development of cough and asthma attacks; no correlation was observed with severe pneumonia. This discrepancy from previous studies could be attributed to the varied recruitment criteria for patients and the impact of a high frequency of co-infection. Considering that the patients in the current study were all hospitalized, they only represented a subset of HRV infections that were more severe than the average. This representation may have suppressed the association between HRV and severe diseases. Nevertheless, the significant associations in this study were inferred after excluding the effects of co-infection by multivariate logistic regression models. This approach presents an advantage over previous studies that lack multivariate analyses for the consideration of the effects from co-infection or other confounding factors13.",

Subsequently, they proposed that the equivalent system for the assignment of new HRV types can be extended to HRV-A and HRV-B31. In the proposed criteria, the VP4/VP2 sequences are predictive of the HRV species and type, which can be used for type identifications in epidemiological studies. Results from previous studies suggest that most or all HRV-C types circulate freely worldwide, among which HRV-C2, C6, C16, and C43 have higher prevalences than other types31. VP4/VP2 sequences were used to study the genetic characteristics of HRV-C, and the HRV-C2 genotype was found to be predominant in Chongqing, China. Additionally, some new sequences divergent from the VP4/VP2 sequences were identified in mainland China. Although lacking the complete gene sequences, the available VP4/VP2 sequences logically support the classification of a novel HRV-C2 lineage, confirming the high genetic diversity of HRV-C in the region. Nonetheless, further characterization of the VP1 sequences is necessary for a comprehensive analysis of the novel HRV-C lineage.",
