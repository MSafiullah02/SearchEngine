( 1984 Wagner et al. ( , 1985 and Proksch and Wagner ( 1987 ) . The polysaccharide contained a (1 \u2192 4)-linked \u03b2-D -xylan backbone with branching points at C-2 and C-3. Three homogeneous polysaccharides, two neutral fucogalactoxyloglucans with mean molecular weight of 10,000 and 25,000 and an acidic arabinogalactan with a mean molecular weight of 75,000 were isolated from the medium of Echinacea purpurea cell cultures ). An arabinogalactan protein (AGP) with molecular weight 1.2 \u00d7 10 6 Da, from pressed juice of Echinacea purpurea , was isolated from a high molecular weight fraction by precipitation with the \u03b2-glucosyl Yariv reagent (Classen et al. 2000 ) . It comprised a high amount of polysaccharide (83 %) with a ratio of galactose to arabinose of 1.8:1, some uronic acids (4-5 %) and a lowprotein content (7 %) with high levels of serine, alanine and hydroxyproline. The amino acid profi le in the arabinogalactan protein comprised serine 16 %, alanine 12.5 %, hydroxyproline 11.5 %, asparagine/aspartic acid 10.6 %, threonine 10.5 %, glutamine/glutamic acid 9.4 %, arginine 7.5 %, glycine 4.6 %, valine 4.1 %, histidine 3.7 %, lysine 3.3 %, leucine 2.5 %, isoleucine 2.2 % and phenylalanine 1,6 %. The monosaccharide profi le in the arabinogalactan protein comprised galactose 59.1, arabinose 33.2, glucosamine 4.0 %, mannose 2.6 % and rhamnose 1.1 %. The molecular weight arabinogalactan protein (AGP) from the pressed juice of Echinacea purpurea was found to have hydroxyproline (42.9 % w/w) as the dominant amino acid and the major amino acid responsible for the binding between the protein and the arabinogalactan subunits via an O -glycosidic linkage (Volk et al. 2007 ). Large amounts of glutamine/ glutamic acid (24.5 % w/w) and asparagine/ aspartic acid (17.3 % w/w) were also found. Another arabinogalactan protein was purifi ed from E. purpurea suspension culture (Classen 2007 ) . It comprised high amount of polysaccharide (90 % w/w) with the dominating monosaccharides galactose and arabinose and some glucuronic acid and a small protein moiety (10 % w/w) with the main amino acids alanine, hydroxyproline, serine, glutamine/glutamic acid, asparagines/aspartic acid and threonine. The polysaccharide part was composed of a branched core-polysaccharide of 3-, 6-and 3,6-linked Galp residues with terminal Araf, Arap, Galp and GlcAp residues. Compared to an arabinogalactan protein from pressed juice of the aerial parts of Echinacea purpurea , differences particularly in terminal arabinose mono-and oligosaccharides in arabinogalactan (AG) side branches could be detected.",

            "text": "The aerial parts of Echinacea purpurea afforded, in addition to known compounds, fi ve highly unsaturated acetylenic amides and a derivative of linolen (Bohlmann and Hoffmann 1983 ) . The aerial parts of E. purpurea were found to contain different structural types of alkamides; the roots yielded similar alkamide pattern (Bauer and Reminger 1989 ) . Alkamide levels differed signifi cantly among roots, rhizomes, stems, leaves and fl owers of E. purpurea (Perry et al. 1997) . Roots were distinguished from other plant parts by higher levels of the C12 diene-diyne alkamides, whereas levels of the C12 tetraene alkamides and C11 diene-diynes were highest in vegetative stems. The ratio of the 2 stereoisomeric C12 tetraene alkamides differed between fl owers and all other E. purpurea parts. The alkylamides and cichoric acid in dried roots and aerial parts of E. purpurea grown in eastern Australia were determined as follows: total alkylamide concentration in root samples was 6.2 mg/g (range 1.2-12.1 mg/g) and in aerial samples was 1.0 mg/g (range 0.2-3.9 mg/g) (Wills and Stuart 1999 ) . The cichoric acid concentration in root samples was 13.2 mg/g (range 1.4-20.5 mg/g) and in aerial samples was 12.9 mg/g (range 4.9-21.4 mg/g). Stuart and Wills ( 2000 ) found that total alkamide concentration in E. purpurea root, stem and leaf decreased throughout the fi rst growing season while the concentration in fl owers increased. In mature plants, the root contained about 70 % of the total plant alkamides with approximately 20 % in fl ower, 10 % in stem and 1 % in leaf tissue. The relative proportion of individual alkamides in the root did not change during plant growth, but cichoric acid concentration in plant tissues did decrease during plant senescence. Similar concentrations of cichoric acid were measured in root, fl ower and leaf tissues, but stem levels were lower. In mature plants, the fl ower and leaf each contained about 35 % of the total plant cichoric acid, while the root and stem contained approximately 20 and 10 %, respectively. Cichoric acid was the main phenolic in E. purpurea roots (mean 2.27 % summer, 1.68 % autumn) and tops (2.02 % summer, 0.52 % autumn) followed by caftaric acid was the other main phenolic compound in the roots (0.40 % summer, 0.35 % autumn) and tops (0.82 % sum-mer, 0.18 % autumn) (Perry et al. 2001 ) . Autumngrown Echinacea purpurea plants in Taiwan produced more caffeoyl phenols, particularly cichoric acid and caftaric acid, in leaf and fl ower tissues than spring-grown plants (Chen et al. 2008 ) . Iranian cultivated E. purpurea tops was found to have a high content of cichoric acid (3.5-5.7 %), followed by caftaric acid (3.1-4.5 %) and caffeic acid (0.6-1.1 %) with total polyphenol content of 7.9-10.9 %, (Iranshahi and Amanzadeh 2008 ) . After 2 hours of boiling water extraction, the content of cichoric acid was 5.7 %, whereas the content of this acid in 60:40 ethanol-water extraction did not exceed 3.9 %.",

The oil was highly polyunsaturated and abundant in linoleic, oleic and palmitic acids, together comprising 95 % of the total fatty acids. E. purpurea seed oils contained 66.5 % linoleic, 21.4 %, oleic and 8 % palmitic acids in the 1998 year harvest and 75.6 % linoleic, 12.2 % oleic and 7 % palmitic acids in the 1999 harvest.

The three different Echinacea root extracts, fresh 1:2, dry 1:11 and dry 1:5, all contained these alkylamides. However, the dry 1:5 extract contained the greatest amount of these compounds. All three extraction techniques investigated here (fresh 1:2, dry 1:5 and dry 1:11) resulted in very similar alkylamide profi le and gave similar yields of alkylamides and of total dissolved solids. The similarity in alkylamide content in fresh 1:2 and dry 1:11 extracts indicated that drying of root material at 50 \u00b0C did not result in a loss of alkylamides. It was concluded that either fresh or dried roots could be used to prepare extracts with high alkylamide content, although the overall yield was slightly lower for fresh extracts.",

Cichoric acid and verbascoside predominated in extracts of E. purpurea roots (Sloley et al. 2001 ) . A total of 16 alkamides, three ketoalkenes, two ketoalkynes and four phenolic acids (echinacoside, cichoric acid, caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid) were identifi ed in aqueous ethanol (70 %) root extracts of Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea pallida (Thomsen et al. 2012 ). The major alkamides in the roots of E. purpurea were at their lowest concentration in the middle of autumn and early winter, while all of the major phenolic acids were at their highest concentrations in spring. In E. purpurea root extract, the major alkamide, dodeca-2 E , 4 E , 8 Z , 10 E / Ztetraenoic acid isobutyl amide, was not significantly affected by storage at any of the temperatures (\u221220, 25 and 40 \u00b0C), but cichoric acid content declined signifi cantly at both 25 and 40 \u00b0C as compared to low-temperature storage (Livesey et al. 1999 ).

Current recommendations for use of these products include oral administration for the prophylaxis and treatment of the common cold, bronchitis, infl uenza and bacterial and viral infections of the respiratory tract. However, based on existing data products containing pressed juice or hydroalcoholic extracts, Echinacea purpurea (leaf juice and roots) and E. pallida (roots) had the most convincing data supporting their use. According to Spelman et al. ( 2009 ) , Echinacea purpurea , a top-selling botanical medicine, is currently of considerable interest due to immunomodulatory, antiinfl ammatory, antiviral and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB 2 )-binding activities of its alkylamide constituents. It is an immunostimulating drug, containing multiple bioactive substances such as polysaccharides, caffeic acid derivatives (caffeic acid, cichoric acid, caftaric acid, chlorogenic acid), alkamides and glycoproteins (Man\u010dek and Kreft 2005 ) . Among the many pharmacological properties reported for E. purpurea extracts, immunomodulation of macrophages had been demonstrated most convincingly (Barrett 2003 ) . Several dozen clinical studies-including a number of blind randomized trials-had reported health benefi ts. The most robust data were from studies testing E. purpurea extracts in the treatment for acute upper respiratory infection. Although indicative of modest benefi t, these studies were limited both in size and in methodological quality. Although a great deal of moderately good-quality scientifi c data regarding E. purpurea , effectiveness in treating illness or in enhancing human health exist, much has not yet been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.",

A high molecular weight arabinogalactan protein (AGP) from the pressed juice of Echinacea purpurea , known to exhibit immunomodulatory properties in vitro, was characterized (Volk et al. 2007 ). Normal human peripheral blood macrophages cultured in concentrations of Echinacea purpurea fresh pressed juice as low as 0.012 \u03bcg/ml produced significantly higher levels of IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10 than unstimulated cells (Burger et al. 1997 ) . The high levels of IL-1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 induced by very low levels of echinacea were consistent with an immune-activated antiviral effect. Echinacea induced lower levels of IL-6 in comparison to the other cytokines measured. Echinacea herb and root powders were found to stimulate murine macrophage cytokine secretion as well as to signifi cantly enhance the viability and/or proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro (Rininger et al. 2000 ) . In contrast, echinacea extracts chemically standardized to phenolic acid or echinacoside content and fresh pressed juice preparations were found to be inactive as immunostimulatory agents but did display, to varying degrees, antiinfl ammatory and antioxidant properties.",

In another study, following 48 hours exposure of dendritic cells from C57Bl/6 mice to E. purpurea root and leaf extracts, it was found that the polysaccharide-rich root extract increased the expression of MHC class II, CD86 and CD54 surface biomarkers whereas the alkylamide-rich leaf extract inhibited expression of these molecules (Benson et al. 2010 ). Production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 increased in a concentration-dependent manner with exposure to the root, but not leaf, extract.

This IL-2 inhibitory activity correlated with the presence of alkylamides but not caffeic acid derivatives. E. purpurea extract was both IL-2 suppressive and cytotoxic at 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml. Lower concentrations from 6.25 to 25 \u03bcg/ml signifi cantly decreased IL-2 production, but not cell viability. Alkylamides at concentrations found in a 50 \u03bcg/ml extract decreased IL-2 production by approximately 50 %, but not cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Echinacea and several of its phytochemical components were found to have opposing effects on NF\u03baB expression by Jurkat cells (a human T-cell line) (Matthias et al. 2008 ). In the absence of stimulation, Echinacea and its components exerted no signifi cant effect on basal NF\u03baB expression levels. In the presence of endotoxin (LPS), NF\u03baB expression was decreased. However, this decrease was signifi cantly reversed by treatment with cichoric acid, an Echinacea root extract (prepared from both Echinacea angustifolia and Echinacea purpurea ) and the alkylamide fraction derived from this combination. For the phorbol myristate acetate stimulation of Jurkat cells, effects on NF\u03baB expression were mixed. Depending on the concentration, cichoric acid and a 2,4-diene alkylamide significantly induced NF\u03baB levels, whereas a 2-ene alkylamide caused a signifi cant inhibition. In contrast, both the Echinacea and the mixed alkylamide fraction exerted no effect. Pugh et al. ( 2012 ) found that differences in total bacterial load within Echinacea purpurea samples were strongly correlated with in-vitro macrophage activity (NF-\u03baB activation in THP-1 cells) and content of bacterial lipopolysaccharides in the extracts. The results added to the growing body of evidence that bacteria within Echinacea were the main source of components responsible for enhancing innate immune function.",

These substances enhanced the spontaneous motility of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) under soft agar and increased the ability of these cells to kill staphylococci. Monocytes were activated to secrete tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukins IL-6 and IL-1, whereas class II expression was unaffected. Intravenous application of the polysaccharides to test subjects immediately induced a fall in the number of PMN in the peripheral blood, indicating activation of adherence to endothelial cells. This decline was followed by a leukocytosis due to an increase in the number of PMN and a lesser increase of monocytes. The acute-phase C-reactive protein (CRP) was induced, probably due to activation of monocytes and macrophages to produce IL-6. Subsequent in-vivo studies found that the purifi ed polysaccharides (EP) from Echinacea purpurea plant cell cultures enhanced mice phagocytes' activities thus protecting against systemic infections with Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans (Roesler et al. 1991a ) . They confi rmed their hypothesis that macrophages (M\u03c6) from different organ origin could be activated to produce IL-1, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 to produce elevated amounts of reactive oxygen intermediates and to inhibit growth of Candida albicans in-vitro and that in-vivo the substances could induce increased proliferation of phagocytes in spleen and bone marrow and migration of granulocytes to the peripheral blood. In a subsequent study, EP was found effective in activating peritoneal macrophages isolated from animals after administration of cyclophosphamide (CP) or cyclosporin A (CsA) (Steinm\u00fcller et al. 1993 ) . EP-treated macrophages exhibited increased production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and enhanced cytotoxicity against tumour target WEHI 164 as well as against the intracellular parasite Leishmania enrietti . After a CP-mediated reduction of leukocytes in the peripheral blood, the polysaccharides induced an earlier infl ux of neutrophil granulocytes as compared to PBS (phosphate buffer saline)-treated controls. EP treatment of mice, immunosuppressed with CP or CsA, restored their resistance against lethal infections with the predominantly macrophage-dependent pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and predominantly granulocyte-dependent Candida albicans .",

Among the components the alkylamides at the dose level of 12 \u03bcg/kg body weight/day signifi cantly increased the phagocytic activity as well as phagocytic index of the alveolar macrophages. The alveolar macrophages obtained from this alkylamide-administered group also produced signifi cantly more TNF-\u03b1 and nitric oxide after an in-vitro stimulation with LPS than any other active component or the control. The immunomodulatory effects of alkylamides appeared to be more pronounced in lungs than in spleen. Studies demonstrated Echinacea purpurea extracts to be potent activators of natural killer (NK) cells cytotoxicity (Gan et al. 2003 ) . NK cytotoxicity was augmented 100 % at the concentration of 0.1 \u03bcg/ml of Echinacea in a short time (4-hour) assay. Echinacea augmented the frequency of NK target conjugates and activated the programming for lysis of NK cells. In another study, dietary administration of E. purpurea (14 days) to aging, normal mice or thyroxin injection revealed that E. purpurea , but not thyroxin, had the capacity to increase natural killer (NK) cell numbers, in aging mice, refl ecting increased new NK cell production in their bone marrow generation site, leading to an increase in the absolute numbers of NK cells in the spleen, their primary destiny (Currier and Miller 2009 ) . The E. purpurea -mediated increase in NK cell numbers was also paralleled by an increase in their antitumour, cytolytic functional capacity. In a recent study levamisole and Echinacea purpurea separately and together exerted a stimulant effect on the immune system in rats (Sadigh-Eteghad et al. 2011 ) . The gamma globulin level, white blood cells, neutrophil and monocyte counts and phagocyte activity increased significantly in comparison with normal saline group during the study.

In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design study with two treatment periods of 14 days involving 40 healthy male volunteers (age range 20-40 years), oral administration of Echinacea purpurea pressed juice for 1 and 2 weeks had only minor effects on two out of 12 lymphocyte subpopulations determined in the study (Schwarz et al. 2005 ).

Most of these effects were reversed by simultaneous exposure to either of the two Echinacea extracts (Sharma et al. 2006a ) . Rhinovirus infection of BEAS-2B cell line resulted in a more dramatic increase in multiple transcription factors including proinfl ammatory factors examined, such as NFkB, AP-1, AP-2 and STATs 1-6 (Sharma et al. 2006b ). However, when rhinovirus-infected cells were treated with either of the two Echinacea extracts, transcription factors levels were reduced to low levels, although the pattern of the reductions was different for the two extracts. The results could help to explain the benefi cial effects of Echinacea consumption. All the viruses tested, rhinoviruses 1A and 14, infl uenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus types 3 and 11, and herpes simplex virus type 1, induced substantial secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 (CXCL8), in addition to several other chemokines, in a line of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) (Sharma et al. 2009 ). In every case, however, Echinacea (Echinaforce, an ethanol extract of herb and roots of E. purpurea ) inhibited this induction. The Echinacea preparation also showed potent virucidal activity against viruses with membranes, indicating the multifunctional potential of the herb. The results supported the concept that certain Echinacea preparations could alleviate 'cold and fl u' symptoms, and possibly other respiratory disorders, by inhibiting viral growth and the secretion of proinfl ammatory cytokines.",

The total daily symptom scores were found to be 23.1 % lower in the echinacea group than in placebo in those who followed all elements of the study protocol. Throughout the treatment period, the response rate to treatments was greater in the echinacea group. A few adverse event profi les were observed in both groups. The researchers concluded that early intervention with a standardized formulation of echinacea resulted in reduced symptom severity in subjects with naturally acquired upper respiratory tract infection. In a clinical study, Echinilin (a formulation prepared from freshly harvested Echinacea purpurea plants and standardized on the basis of three known active components: alkamides, cichoric acid and polysaccharides) or placebo was administered to volunteers at the onset of their cold for a period of 7 days, with eight doses (5 ml/dose) on day 1 and three doses on subsequent days (Goel et al. 2005 ) . The decrease in total daily symptomatic score was more evident in the echinacea group than in the placebo group. These effects of echinacea were associated with a signifi cant and sustained increase in the number of circulating total white blood cells, monocytes, neutrophils and natural killer cells. In the later part of the cold, the echinacea treatment suppressed the cold-related increase in superoxide production by the neutrophils. The results suggested that Echinilin, by enhancing the nonspecifi c immune response and eliciting free radical scavenging properties, may have led to a faster resolution of the cold symptoms. Jawad et al. ( 2012 ) conducted a 4-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the safety (risk) and effi cacy (benefi t) of Echinacea purpurea (95 % herba and 5 % root) extract in the prevention of common cold episodes with 755 healthy subjects. Echinacea extract found to reduce the total number of cold episodes, cumulated episode days within the group, and painkiller-medicated episodes. Echinacea inhibited virally confi rmed colds and especially prevented enveloped virus infections. Echinacea showed maximal effects on recurrent infections, and preventive effects increased with therapy compliance and adherence to the protocol. A total of 293 adverse events occurred with echinacea and 306 with placebo treatment. Nine and 10 % of participants experienced adverse events, which were at least possibly related to the study drug (adverse drug reactions). Thus, the safety of Echinacea was noninferior to placebo. The study concluded that compliant prophylactic intake of E. purpurea over a 4-month period appeared to provide a positive risk to benefi t ratio In a randomized, placebo-controlled, doubleblind study, treatment with fl uid extract of Echinacea purpurea (widely used for the prevention and treatment of colds and respiratory infections), did not signifi cantly decrease the incidence, duration or severity of colds and respiratory infections compared to placebo (Grimm and M\u00fcller 1999 ) . During the 8-week treatment period, 35 (65 %) of 54 patients in the echinacea group and 40 (74 %) of 54 patients in the placebo group had at least one cold or respiratory infection. The average number of colds and respiratory infections per patient was 0.78 in the echinacea group, and 0.93 in the placebo group. There were no signifi cant differences between treatment groups in the number of infections in each category of severity. Side effects were observed in 11 patients (20 %) of the echinacea group and in seven patients (13 %) of the placebo group. In a randomized, double-blind placebocontrolled trial of 175 adults travelling back from Australia to America, Europe or Africa for a period of 1-5 weeks on commercial fl ights via economy class, supplementation with standardized Echinacea tablets, taken before and during travel, may have preventive effects against the development of respiratory symptoms during travel involving long-haul fl ights (Tiralongo et al. 2012 ) . In another study, 128 patients were enrolled within 24 hours of cold symptom onset in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design wherein patients received either 100 mg of E. purpurea (freeze-dried pressed juice from the aerial portion of the plant) or a lactose placebo 3 times daily until cold symptoms were relieved or until the end of 14 days, whichever came fi rst ( Yale and Liu 2004 ) . No statistically signifi cant difference was observed between treatment groups for either total symptom scores or mean individual symptom scores. The time to resolution of symptoms was not statistically different. The effi cacy of E. purpurea in reducing common cold was not confi rmed.",

There was no signifi cant difference in duration or severity of symptoms with Echinacea purpurea compared with placebo in children with upper respiratory tract infection. In another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 407 children aged 2-11 years including 337 upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) treated with echinacea and 370 with placebo, Echinacea purpurea was found not effective in treating URI symptoms in these children, and its use was associated with an increased risk of rash (Taylor et al. 2003 ) . Scoop et al. (2006) conducted a meta-analysis on the therapeutic effectiveness of Echinacea in the treatment and the prevention of colds, wherein 3 suitable studies were selected for pooling of data, and 231 were excluded from the analysis because they related to studies of spontaneous common colds. The meta-analysis suggested that standardized extracts of Echinacea were effective in the prevention of symptoms of the common cold after clinical inoculation, compared with placebo. However, more prospective, appropriately structured clinical studies were required to confi rm. Although Echinacea preparations tested in clinical trials differed greatly, there was some evidence that preparations based on the aerial parts of Echinacea purpurea might be effective for the early treatment of colds in adults but results were not fully consistent (Linde et al. 2006 ) . Benefi cial effects of other Echinacea preparations and for preventative purposes might exist but had not been shown in independently replicated, rigorous, randomized trials. A metaanalysis of 14 studies provided published evidence supporting Echinacea 's benefi t in decreasing the incidence and duration of the common cold (Shah et al. 2007 ). Woelkart et al. ( 2008 ) stated that Echinacea preparations were more effective than no treatment, more effective than placebo or similarly effective to other treatments in the prevention and the treatment of the common cold. In a more recent review on the effi cacy of Echinacea in cold prevention, Hart and Dey ( 2009 ) reiterated that in view of the residual uncertainty and the gaps between the evidence and the ways that this was summarized on webpages, it may prove diffi cult for consumers to assimilate the evidence. As well as undertaking high-quality trials in complementary medicine, there was a need to ensure precision in the reporting of uncertainty.",

Results showed that hexane extracts of Echinacea variably inhibited growth of yeast strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Candida shehata , C. kefyr , C. albicans , C. steatulytica and C. tropicalis under near UV irradiation (phototoxicity) and to a lower extent without irradiation (conventional antifungal activity) (Binns et al. 2000 ) . The presence of polyacetylenes and alkylamides in extracts of different organs was confi rmed in Echinacea purpurea and was related to phototoxic activity. Significant phototoxicity was demonstrated by pure trideca-1-ene-3,5,7,9,10-pentayne from E. purpurea roots, while only minor phototoxicity was induced by the other two E. purpurea acetylenic compounds undeca-2 E ,4 Z -diene-8,10-diynoic acid isobutylamide and dodeca-2 E ,4 E ,8 Z ,10 E / Ztetraenoic acid isobutylamide. Phototoxic activity of Echinacea spp. was primarily attributed to the ketoalkenes and ketoalkynes abundantly present in the roots. Root extracts of the eight Echinacea species including E. purpurea showed antifungal activity against most of the pathogenic fungi ( Trichophyton tonsurans , T. mentagrophytes , Microsporum gypseum , Pseudallescheria boydii , Cryptococcus neoformans and two Candida albicans isolates) (Merali et al. 2003 ) . Recent studies on Echinacea purpurea had revealed that certain standardized preparations contain potent and selective antiviral and antimicrobial activities (Hudson 2012 ) . In addition, they displayed multiple immunomodulatory activities, comprising stimulation of certain immune functions such as phagocytic activity of macrophages and suppression of the proinfl ammatory responses of epithelial cells to viruses and bacteria, which are manifested as alterations in secretion of various cytokines and chemokines. E. purpurea dried aerial part ethanol extract showed a considerable growth inhibition on Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae , while no growth inhibition zones were observed for Aspergillus niger (Stanisavljevi\u0107 et al. 2009 ). In-vitro studies showed a standardized preparation of Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce\u00ae) could provide a safe twofold benefi t to acne individuals by inhibiting proliferation of the Gram-positive bacterium Propionibacterium acnes and reversing the bacterial-induced infl ammation (Sharma et al. 2011 ). E. purpurea completely reversed the bacterial increase in secretion of substantial amounts of several proinfl ammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8 (CXCL8), and brought the cytokine levels back to normal.",

Chicca et al. ( 2009 ) demonstrated that ethanol E. purpurea radix and herba extracts elicited synergistic pharmacological effects on the endocannabinoid system in vitro. Supra-additive action of N -alkylamide combinations was observed at the level of intracellular calcium release as a function of cannabinoid receptor type-2 (CB 2 ) activation. Likewise, synergism of the radix and herba tinctures was observed in LPS-stimulated cytokine expression from human PBMCs. While the expression of the antiinfl ammatory cytokine IL-10 was signifi cantly superstimulated, the expression of the proinfl ammatory TNF-\u03b1 protein was inhibited more strongly upon combination of the extracts. They concluded that N -alkylamides in the extracts acted in concert to exert pleiotropic effects modulating the endocannabinoid system by simultaneously targeting the CB 2 receptor, endocannabinoid transport and degradation. Cannabinoid type-1 (CB 1 ) and CB 2 receptors belong to the family of G proteincoupled receptors and are the primary targets of the endogenous cannabinoids N -arachidonoyl ethanolamine and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol . CB 2 receptors are believed to play an important role in distinct pathophysiological processes, including metabolic dysregulation, infl ammation, pain and bone loss.",

Mixed alkamides and the major component, dodeca-2 E ,4 E ,8 Z ,10 Z ( E )-tetraenoic acid isobutylamides (8/9), were then isolated from E. purpurea root extracts for further bioactivity elucidation. In macrophages, the alkamides signifi cantly inhibited cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) activity and the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of COX-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase and specifi c cytokines or chemokines [i.e., TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2] but elevated heme oxygenase-1 protein expression. Cichoric acid, however, exhibited little or no effect. In another study, three alkamides and nitidanin diisovalerianate were identifi ed, together with 14 known alkamides and one sesquiterpene from the roots of Echinacea purpurea (Hohmann et al. 2011 ) . Their interaction with G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors was examined on rat brain membrane preparations. Both partial and inverse agonist compounds for cannabinoid (CB1) receptors were identifi ed among the metabolites, characterized by weak to moderate interactions with the G-protein signalling mechanisms. Upon coadministration with arachidonyl-2\u2032chloroethylamide, a number of them proved capable of inhibiting the stimulation of the pure agonist, thereby demonstrating cannabinoid receptor antagonist properties. In an earlier study, alkylamides, anandamide and SR144528 were found to potently inhibit lipopolysaccharideinduced infl ammation in human whole blood and exerted modulatory effects on cytokine expression, but these effects were not exclusively related to CB 2 binding .

In-vivo studies in rats showed that E. purpurea may interact cytochrome P450 enzymes and induce signifi cant herb-drug interactions which may alter pharmacotherapy (Mrozikiewicz, et al. 2010 ). The Echinacea ethanol extract could potently inhibit the expression of CYP3A1 (41 %) and CYP3A2 (25 %) mRNAs. A weaker inhibitory effect was observed for CYP2D2 by 15 % and CYP2C6 by 18 % after long application of the Echinacea ethanol extract. CYP2D2 and CYP2C6 activities were also inhibited by extract but in a lesser degree than CYP3A1 activity.

Short-term use of Echinacea was reported to be associated with a relatively good safety profi le, with a slight risk of transient, reversible, adverse events. The major adverse events reported with Echinacea products are allergic reactions, ranging from contact dermatitis to anaphylaxis (Mahady et al. 2001 ) . Patients with an allergy to plants in the daisy family (Asteraceae) should be instructed not to use products containing Echinacea. The use of Echinacea products during pregnancy and lactation would appear to be ill-advised in light of the paucity of data in this area. According to the review by Perri et al. ( 2006 ) there was good scientifi c evidence from a prospective cohort study that oral consumption of Echinacea during the fi rst trimester did not increase the risk for major malformations. Low-level evidence based on expert opinion showed oral consumption of Echinacea in recommended doses to be safe for use during pregnancy and lactation. Echinacea was non-teratogenic when used during pregnancy. However more quality studies were needed to determine its safety.",

A signifi cant dose-independent downregulation of the proinfl ammatory cytokines IL-12p70, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF was observed after 24 hours. The results demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of dodeca-2 E ,4 E ,8 Z ,10 E / Z -tetraenoic isobutylamides were linear and that absorption was very rapid ( t 1/2 = 6 minutes) with apparently no lag time, thus indicating the possibility that a fraction of the drug was absorbed through the oral mucosa. In an earlier study, after oral ingestion, the arithmetic mean C (max) of dodeca-2 E ,4 E ,8 Z ,10 E / Z -tetraenoic acid isobutylamides absorbed for Echinacea purpurea tincture was 0.40 ng/ml serum with 30 minutes t (max), while for the Echinacea tablet the t (max) of tablets was 45 minutes with a C (max) of 0.12 ng/ml (Woelkart et al. 2006 ) . Both E. purpurea preparations led to the same effects on the immune system according to the concentration of proinfl ammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-8. Twenty-three hours after oral application a signifi cant downregulation of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in LPS pre-stimulated whole blood was found. However, no signifi cant changes in the concentration of IL-6 were observed.",
