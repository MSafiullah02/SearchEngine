Indeed, the DSM-III and its successors revolutionized the field by creating a common language for clinicians to use in characterizing their patients. An equally profound change occurred in psychiatric research, where systematic assessment of psychopathology became standard practice. Like all landmark ideas, the DSM-III soon began to be used for purposes beyond its original raison d\u2019 etre; it became a nosology without a medical basis. One of the reasons for this development has been the absence of definitive knowledge of biological contributors to most of the major DSM syndromes.",

Phenomenology strives for syndromic homogeneity, although syndromic homogeneity is neither feasible nor desirable. First, use of the DSM-III or DSM-IV criteria results in nonhomogeneous syndromes, because different symptom permutations might qualify for the same diagnosis. Second, psychiatric disorders need not have homogeneous clinical presentations any more than medical illnesses do. Authoritative textbooks of medicine, like the Harrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine, permit a variety of accompanying features in describing the clinical picture of medical illnesses, (e.g., pneumonia might be accompanied by dyspnea, fever). The typical presentation of a syndrome rarely occurs in all patients with the same medical illness (e.g., myocardial infarction without precordial pain is common among older adults). Some diseases are, in fact, characterized by their clinical heterogeneity. Syphilis has so many diverse clinical presentations that it once was referred to as the great imitator. The diverse clinical presentations of mycoplasma pneumonia led to the early term atypical pneumonia. Insistence on uniform clinical presentation can be counterproductive, because it might classify as \u201cnon-syndromes\u201d conditions with common pathogenetic contributors. Nonetheless, improved understanding of specific contributors to the pathogenesis of a larger syndrome might provide information on specific symptoms. For example, subjects with frontrostriatal dysfunction and depression might exhibit executive function deficits, whereas individuals with an early-onset depression with significant genetic contribution might exhibit other clinical features.",

First, executive dysfunction, a disturbance resulting from compromised integrity of frontal structures and their subcortical connections, is common in geriatric depression (Lockwood et al 2002, Nebes et al 2001) and persists after improvement of mood-related symptoms (Murphy and Alexopoulos 2004, Nebes et al 2003). Second, disorders compromising frontostriatal pathways are often complicated by depression. Subcortical dementing disorders, including vascular dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Huntington\u2019s disease are more likely to result in depression than cortical dementias (Sobin and Sackeim 1997). Moreover, development of depression is more likely to occur in Alzheimer\u2019s patients with subcortical atrophy (Starkstein et al 1995).",

            "text": "Cognitive neuroscience studies suggest that dysfunction in certain parts of frontostriatal circuitry (i.e., the prefrontal cortices and the anterior cingulate) is relevant to the development of depressive symptoms. A model of the prefrontal cortex function proposes that this brain structure maintains the representation of an individual\u2019s goals and sends signals to other brain areas to facilitate the expression of task-appropriate response (Davidson et al 2002). Such signals facilitate the expression of the most adaptive response to a stimulus at the expense of an immediately rewarding response. Theoretically, abnormalities in prefrontal circuitry responsible for positive affect-guided anticipation might predispose to some types of depression and result in failure to anticipate positive incentives. The left medial orbitofrontal cortex is activated in response to reward, and the right orbitofrontal cortex in response to punishment (O\u2019Doherty et al 2001); both of these functions are relevant to depression. The anterior cingulate gyrus has connections to brain structures relevant to the expression of depressive symptoms and is responsible for functions that are often impaired in depression. Accordingly, the affective cingulate subdivision is connected to the orbitofrontal cortex, the amygdala, the lateral hypothalamus, the anterior insula, the periaqueductal grey, and some autonomic stem centers (Bush et al 2000, Ongur et al 1998a). The affective cingulate assesses conflicts between current function and information with motivational consequences and integrates affective and cognitive information. The cognitive cingulate subdivision has connections with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate, the parietal cortex, and the supplementary motor cortex. Its principal function is to monitor competing responses and modulate attention and executive functions in collaboration with the dorsolateral cortex (Bush et al 2000, Whalen et al 1998).",

Hypometabolism of the rostral anterior cingulate was reported in treatment-resistant depression, whereas cingulate hypermetabolism was associated with favorable response (Mayberg 2001). Anterior cingulate activity is a predictor of the extent of treatment response in depressed young adults (Pizzagalli et al 2001). Finally, increased left frontal error negative wave amplitude after a response inhibition task (mediated by the anterior cingulate) predicts limited or slow change in depressive symptoms in elders receiving citalopram treatment (Kalayam and Alexopoulos 2003).",

Similar changes occur in experimentally induced sadness (Mayberg 2001). So the expression of depressive symptoms might be mediated by a common pathway, but the predisposing factor, in this case, frontostriatal, amygdalar, or hippocampal dysfunction, might be unique to a subgroup of depressed patients. In contrast, nondepressed individuals who develop sadness at-will might have a quick normalization of their sadness-associated brain metabolic changes, because they have no predisposing factors to sustain symptoms of depression.",

Degenerative, vascular, as well as immune and inflammatory processes might lead to dysfunction of subcortical structures and thus be the etiological factors underlying vulnerability to depression. Depression often occurs in degenerative disorders of subcortical structures with a long preclinical phase (Sobin and Sackeim 1997). Similarly, depression is common in patients with vascular risk factors and disorders resulting in subcortical lesions (Alexopoulos et al 1997a, Krishnan et al 1997). Finally, pro- inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-\u03b3, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and C-reactive protein are elevated during depressed states (Schiepers et al 2005, Thomas et al 2005). Interferon administration often leads to development of depressive symptoms or syndromes, but also to cognitive and electrophysiological changes (Amodio et al 2005).",

For example, depressed elders with evidence of frontostriatal impairment might be candidates for dopamine enhancing agents, whereas use of such agents in a broader group of depressed patients might dilute the therapeutic signal and lead to the erroneous conclusion that dopaminergic agents have no antidepressant properties for any patients (Alexopoulos 2001). Similarly, research might examine whether adjunct pharmacotherapy with agents enhancing the metabolism of frontostriatal structures (e.g., modafinil; Scammell 2000) can improve the outcomes of depressed patients with evidence of anterior cingulate dysfunction. Although these approaches are sensible, their efficacy must be clinically tested. The reason is that direct lesion-to-syndrome relationships are unlikely in late-life depression. Moreover, even \u201cselectively-acting drugs\u201d have broader effects and change the function of systems other than those on which they exert their immediate action (Millan 2004). Finally, treatment and prevention studies need to investigate the efficacy of behavioral approaches (e.g., problem solving therapy) that remedy behavioral deficits originating from executive dysfunction (Alexopoulos et al 2003).",

For example, a treatment study using cognitive behavior therapy for adults with major depression demonstrated that treatment response was associated with increases in metabolism in the hippocampus and dorsal cingulate (Goldapple et al 2004). Understanding these regional changes might also influence the selection of treatment, because new data suggest that cellular plasticity might be enhanced by antidepressant treatment in a way that intercedes in hippocampal loss by inducing regional neurogenesis (Kempermann and Kronenberg 2003). Specifically, serotonergic antidepressants have been shown to increase neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus (Malberg et al 2000).",
