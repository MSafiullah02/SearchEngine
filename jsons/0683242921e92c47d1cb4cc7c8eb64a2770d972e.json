Our natural progression leads us to modern theories of disaster and Disaster Risk Management (DRM) that have had to tackle new types of disasters that are being brought about by the interconnectivity of societies, people, diseases, technology, etc., increasing in magnitude and complexity like what was seen in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011 and on-setting disasters like climate change. After looking at all the historical evidence, we come to a definition for the term disaster for modern usage and what it means for policy implications.",

The commonly used English word \"disaster\" originates from the Latin words \"dis-astrum,\" meaning \"ominous star.\" Disaster, as it is reflected in its origin, had been historically interpreted and used as a massive and sudden calamity due to the unfavorable position of a planet or star, implying \"impossible to control,\" because it is caused by God's will (Etkin 2015). In other words, disaster had been mostly considered as a naturally occurring disaster, resulting from external components, such as typhoons and earthquakes. Currently, it has matured to include technological and social disasters, reflecting the evolutionary circumstances of the contemporary society.",

The disaster classification system of EM-DAT is in four levels: generic group, subgroup, main type, and subtype. Generic group, the highest level of the system, classifies disaster into natural and technological disasters. The natural disaster category is divided into six subgroups: biological, geophysical, climatological, hydrological, meteorological, and extraterrestrial disasters. Each subgroup in turn covers 12 disaster types and more than 32 subtypes. More detailed information can be found in the EM-DAT report (CRED 2008) . NatCatSERVICE provided by Munich Re Group in Germany is another database related to disasters that wins global recognition, using a natural disaster classification system similar to EM-DAT. NatCatSERVICE enters all natural disasters that cause human and physical damages regardless of scale, but it does not mention artificial/technological disasters (Munich Re 2011) .",

Medical disasters or disease disasters refer to chemical disasters that cause hindrance to respiratory organs and metabolic systems due to the leakage of chemicals, radioactive matters, or toxic agents. This classification method has significance in that it is possible to predict the conditions of the patients in disasters and effectively manage medical resources accordingly (Kim and Lim 1995) . In case of instant disaster with single primary response agency, such as dam failures, major rail accidents, and maritime accidents, the CDSCHQ and the CDMHQ are established simultaneously; the CDMHQ takes charge of response, and the CDSCHQ coordinates the pan-governmental support Primary response agency takes charge of its own responsibility in the early stage of the event.

He coined the notion of Heinrich's Law, which states that, for every major accident, there have been 29 preceding minor accidents and 300 signs of anomaly (Heinrich 1950 ). Heinrich's Law is therefore also known as the Law of 1:29:300. In other words, an accident that is large enough for people to notice is only a small tip of an iceberg and is always antedated by countless other accidents and happenings that warn of the upcoming disaster. Through a scientific statistical approach on industrial disasters that were once believed to take place unexpectedly, Heinrich found that massive disasters occurred due to negligence on minor defections. Originally, the Heinrich's Law was applied to industrial disasters, but it is now extended to rules related to accidents, disasters, and failures throughout all kinds of areas in contemporary society. The 1:29:300 rule is meaningful in that it sets up a rule to explain quantitatively the process of an evolutionary incident, starting from a small accident and resulting in a catastrophic event.",

In other words, Heinrich insisted that if the third condition is effectively eliminated, disaster can be prevented before it occurs (Heinrich 1950) . The 1995 Sampoong Department Store collapse accident in Korea is a typical example of the Heinrich's Law. The accident happened because no countermeasures had been taken even though there were many signals before the accident. The department store opened its business with inborn structural problems during the construction process: about 76 tons of installation equipment was installed on the rooftop, which was four times more than its original design load, and reinforcing bars were out of place. Along with problematic construction, poor management was another cause of the accident: minor symptoms such as cracks in the ceilings and damage to the floor of the rooftop (potential elements of 300) were overlooked by staff and maintenance crews. In addition, although customers and employees raised several concerns about the general health of the building, such as vibrating sound from an air conditioner and many cracks in the wall, no specific actions were taken, even after receiving evaluations from experts (29 small accidents). Neglecting potential elements eventually led to one huge accident with 1000 casualties (one massive accident) (Lee et al. 2008) .",

Charles Perrow proposed the Normal Accident Theory based on the empirical evidence of the Three Mile Island (TMI) Nuclear Power Plant accident that took place in Pennsylvania in 1979, the first nuclear power plant crisis to have occurred. Perrow (1984) defines a normal accident, which he also refers to as a system accident, as \"an event that involves the unanticipated interaction of multiple failures, reflecting the characteristics of high-risk system in which multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable.\"",

Ulrich Beck, the German sociologist, suggested the concept of risk society as a solution to structural and deep-rooted problems of industrial societies, including science and technical safety issues, which started in the mid-1980s (Lee et al. 2008) . In his book World Risk Society (1999), Ulrich Beck argued that the modern society is a \"risk society\" replete with risks all throughout and emphasized the multiplication of cross border risks and international dangers that single nationstates cannot tackle on their own (Beck 1999) . During his lecture at Seoul National University in 2008, Beck pointed out the similarities between the Asian Financial Crisis in the 1990s and the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant accident in 1986, stressing the importance that all nations must work together to reduce the global risk on the basis of a common understanding that they are facing the same global risk. Beck also considers this emerging risk as a result of the de-bounding of traditional national boundaries in the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions. Beck defined risk society as a society where socially produced risk is inherently accompanied by socially produced wealth (Oh 2013) . He also insisted that industrial society should be addressed through a comprehensive perspective, which includes social, historical, and technological views (Beck 1986 ).",

The Complexity Theory is useful for understanding the characteristics of contemporary disasters and finding appropriate countermeasures. On March 11, 2011, the fourth strongest earthquake struck Japan, since Japan started to observe earthquakes, with a mega tsunami and aftershock that caused more than 20,000 deaths. Also, the earthquake destroyed the nearby Fukushima nuclear power plants and caused radiation leakage. This disaster showed signs of complex disaster.

Due to a heavy rain, combined with low topographic characteristics of Thailand and high tide of seawater, two thirds of the land in Thailand, including parts of Bangkok, was flooded, causing significant damage to the entire manufacturing industry. The 2011 flood did not affect just Thailand. For example, many Japanese companies' production facilities located in the central region, having developed the area for the manufacturing of automotive and electronic goods, were inundated during the flood. The intensity of the flooding caused all of the facilities to be shut down, which caused tremendous economic loss for both countries. Additionally, the shutdown of the automotive plants caused a reduction of Japanese auto and parts deliveries to other major markets like Japan, the USA, and Europe. In case of the electric and electronic industry, hard disks became in short supply due to flooding of hard disk manufacturing factories. Due to this, the production of semiconductors by Intel became inadequate, resulting in a short supply of semiconductors to the world's semiconductor market. Moreover, it caused a price increase of computers worldwide. Also, since the severe flood occurred right before the tourist season, the number of tourists in the fourth quarter decreased by approximately 20%, and additionally induced damages occurred in other industries, such as transportation and food services. Due to the influence of the heavy flood, the estimated economic growth rate of Thailand in 2011 was lowered from 3.8% to 2.1% (Korea Institute for International Economic Policy 2011). Table 2 .6 shows the summary of damage that occurred to the Japanese economy due to the heavy flood in Thailand. This table shows that the flood was not just problematic for Thailand but indicates that a disaster occurring in one country does influence other countries.",

Pelling (2003) argued that Complexity Theory possesses a very important lesson to understanding ways to cope with disasters. For example, one of the characteristics of Complexity Theory is \"emergence,\" which shows a trait of disasters that take place with unexpected causes at an unexpected place. According to Drabek and McEntire (2003) , \"emergence\" appears while people change organizations in the process of making temporary organizations and responding to disaster situations. Beck's Risk Society and Perrow's Normal Accident Theory share the similar understanding with Complexity Theory in that the emerging risk in modern society is closely related with its increased complexity. Therefore, the core elements of Complexity Theory, such as nonlinearity, self-similarity, fractal, self-organization, and emergence, are essential in understanding disaster characteristic and innovating disaster response methods in modern society.",

Organizations such as the USA's FEMA, created in the 1970s, used the progressing knowledge and concepts to help it mature in the 1990s, and the UN and world stakeholders, who came together in the early 2000s to produce the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), used the foundations' insights to increase disaster resilience around the world.

The Theory aims to overcome the problems of a typical bureaucracy and to improve the efficiency of the public sector by adopting business management skills and by emphasizing output and outcome of public policy rather than the input to implement the policy (Rosenbloom and Goldman 1998) . The Theory was accepted through the National Performance Review project during the Clinton Administration, and laid the foundation for FEMA's reformation (Waugh and Streib 2006) . The demand for the reformation of FEMA started from Hurricane Hugo, which hit North Carolina and the Virgin Islands in 1989, causing $15 billion in damages. In the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck California, a fire broke out in Oakland, and Hurricane Andrew struck Florida and Louisiana, dealing a massive blow to the two states. Disappointed by FEMA's ineffective response to these massive natural disasters, political groups and citizens in the USA raised the need to improve FEMA's performance, which was endorsed by the Clinton Administration in 1993 (Anna et al. 2006 ). James Lee Witt, appointed as director of FEMA by President Clinton, emphasized disaster mitigation and shifted from recovery-oriented policy to preventionoriented policy. Additionally, he insisted that disaster mitigation investment should be based on the assessment of the effectiveness. Consequently, government policy has continued to embrace this line of thinking. To quantify the future savings of hazard mitigation activities, the Multihazard Mitigation Council (MMC) of the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) analyzed three major hazard mitigation grant programs: the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, Project Impact, and the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program.",

President Jimmy Carter created FEMA in 1979 for this reason. The establishment of FEMA made it possible to unify the fragmented responsibilities of emergency preparedness and response resources (Anna et al. 2006) . McLoughlin (1985) proposed an integrated emergency management model. Considering disaster as an incident or condition that threatens the survival of organizations, he was concerned with the fact that troubles in cooperation among related agencies repeatedly occurred during disaster response since various public and private groups had been engaged in disaster response without comprehensive coordination. He argued that a comprehensive and integrated emergency management system could sustain administrative capabilities during emergencies and protect property and life through a series of circulation processes under the cooperation of the federal, state, and local governments. This model emphasizes that each local government and the federal government should cooperate to protect life, property, and government functions through a program of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery (Cho 2015) . Quarantelli (1993) also emphasized that comprehensive disaster management is essential in modern times in order to build a comprehensive and unified organization that manages all types of disasters. He argued that a dispersed or separated approach, by which each line ministry is responsible for its own disaster; devoid of a coordinating agency, cannot deal with complex and intensified disasters in modern times.

Within this context, since the 2000s, civil defense and civil protection became important concepts in disaster management. Civil defense was originally designed to protect citizens from calamities, such as war, but it was gradually expanded to encompass DRM, reducing civilian casualties during disasters. Alexander (2006) suggested that the role of the state and the civilian in disaster preparedness be shifted from Civil Defense to Civil Protection. This is because Civil Protection is an appropriate concept to reinforce the protection of people against external risks, meeting the need to protect people from typical disasters, such as natural and technological disasters, as well as emerging risks, such as new infectious diseases, terrorism, and cyber attacks, while Civil Defense was useful to cope with the invasion of an outside force which was a severe threat during the Cold War era.",

However, the civil protection concept by Alexander put stress on a bottom-up approach: emergency preparedness and response ensuring public participation and cooperation, problemsolving approach, and openness principles. As a result, risk governance is the most critical issue in civil protection, ensuring the cooperative interaction among the government, the private sector, and civil organizations to replace the existing hierarchical bureaucratic system. Alexander (2006) addressed Hurricane Katrina as a typical failure case of Civil Defense with a top-down approach, requesting a shift from a top-down approach to a bottom-up approach, along with improved risk governance.",

When a large-scale disaster occurs in Germany, the Federal Ministry of Home Affairs calls up the Crisis Task Force (Krisenstab). The task force works jointly with relevant departments within the federal government, agencies under the Ministry of Interior, and state liaison officers. In the event of a major type of catastrophic event that can be a national crisis, the Ministry of Interior will form the joint task force with responsible ministries. For example, if a nuclear accident or an illegal use of radioactive materials happens, the BMI and the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB, Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Umwelt, Naturschutz, Bau und Reaktorsicherheit) will form the joint crisis management task force. When pandemics or biochemical terrorism occurs, the BMI and the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG, Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit) will form the joint task force. The German local system consists of the state (L\u00e4nder) government, the city or county (Kreis) government, and the municipal government (Gemeinde). Disaster management organizations in Germany's local system are different depending on the characteristics of each region; however, departments dealing with internal affairs mostly take charge of disaster management. In recent years, there have also been a growing number of states establishing disaster risk protection departments (Gefahrenabwehr) by experiencing increased terrorism and massive natural disasters due to climate change.

            "text": "Most developed countries have put stress on developing an effective disaster response system to cope with emerging risk interwoven with complexity and climate change. The policy implications through the comparative analysis can be summarized as follows:First, many countries aim for an integrated organization that considers both natural disasters and social disasters. The USA has endeavored to build an integrated disaster management system through the establishment of FEMA, and since the 9/11 Terror Attack, the DHS has been integrated to take charge of disaster management and terrorism. The DHS set the National Preparedness Goal to reflect the insights and lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina and to build a comprehensive organizational capacity for the entire nation that includes federal, state, and local governments and the private sector.Japan and the UK have an organization that control and coordinate disaster and emergency response directly under the Prime Minister. The CCA of UK and the Cabinet Office of Japan are both small in size, but they are characterized by a very high level of authority for the overall coordination of disaster policies. According to the types in the reorganization of disaster management proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the case of the USA corresponds to the first case, \"super-ministry,\" and Japan and the UK correspond to the second type, \"a relatively small and highly influential body under direct authority of the head of government\" (Wyman 2009 ). Disaster response plans are also being developed within national and local governments using an integrated disaster management style for all hazards approaches (Waugh 2000) .Second, all stakeholder engagement for disaster response is highly recommended. The USA successfully established the disaster risk management system by promoting the engagement and commitment of all levels of governments, citizens, and NGOs. Australia and Japan also developed standard operating procedures indicating citizenry roles and activities in case of emergencies. In addition, Australia developed checklists to enhance citizenry participation for disaster preparedness. Japan has enhanced citizenry participation and preparedness by strengthening citizenry education and training. Korea should improve the participation of local governments, NGOs, and citizens to DRM by providing guidelines and incentives and enhancing the governance-based approach.Finally, many countries have stressed the clear accountability of each government and interlink between the national government and local governments. Most countries, such as Australia, Germany, Japan, and the USA, empowered local governments for disaster response and engaged in the national crisis situation. In addition, the interlink between national and local disaster response planning was also emphasized. The USA improved interlink between NRF and NIMS at the federal level and EOP at the state and local levels. In Australia, the Attorney",
