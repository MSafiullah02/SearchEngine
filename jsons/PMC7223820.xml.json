Majority of these newly emerged diseases are caused by microorganisms and causative microbes are increasingly becoming drug resistant over time (Bhatia and Narain 2010). To combat such infectious diseases, novel bioactive compounds from plants and microorganisms could provide the best alternative as source of potential and promising drugs (Morens et al. 2004). Although, plant is the major source of bioactive compounds, nevertheless, endophytes could play a vital role in search of new bioactive compounds (Jalgaonwala et al. 2011). Endophytic fungi colonize healthy plant tissues without any disease symptoms and protect plants from herbivores and pathogens as because they produce bioactive secondary metabolites in the host tissues. It is reported that, endophytic fungi could produce similar or the same bioactive metabolites as its host plant. The environmental conditions of plant habitat have also some effects on the endophytes present inside the plants (Sette et al. 2006).",

These halophytic (salt tolerant) plants thrive in intertidal areas that receive daily inundation between mean sea levels and the highest astronomical tides. It has been well established that environment where the plant grows has enormous effect on the diversity of the metabolites produced by the entophytes (Tomlinson 1986; Duke et al. 1998). With this end in view, Sonneratia apetala (Buch.-Ham), has been selected for the present study because this plant has hardly been considered for its bioactive endophytic fungi and is one of the most dominant species in the Sundarbans mangrove forest. Thus, the present study was conducted to investigate the abundance of endophytic fungi associated with S. apetala found in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh and evaluate antimicrobial activity of the fungal endophytes against human pathogens. Screening of endophytic fungi with inhibitory activities against pathogenic bacteria or fungi might lead to potential novel natural products with higher antimicrobial activity.",

The samples were surface-dried with sterile filter paper (Hormazabal and Piontelli 2009). Roots, bark, fruits and leaves were cut into 0.5 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm pieces and placed in petri dishes containing aqueous agar (1.5% agar\u2013agar in distilled water) supplemented with antibiotic streptomycin (0.03 mg/mL) and incubated at 28 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C until initiation of fungal growth. The tips of the fungal hyphae were collected from the aqueous agar and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. After several days of incubation, the purity of each fungal culture was determined by assessing the colony morphology. The isolates were cultured on PDA media to obtain pure cultures and then transferred into PDA slants for preservation at 4 \u00b0C.",

Fungal genomic DNA was isolated according to the protocol supplied along with the DNA isolation kit (Cat-26200; NORGEN BIOTEK Corp., 3430 Schmon Parkway, Thorold, ON, Canada). Forward primer ITS4 (5\u2032TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC3\u2032) and reverse primer ITS5 (5\u2032GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG3\u2032) were used to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the fungi using Polymerase Chain Reaction (Sette et al. 2006). The PCR reaction was performed in 50 \u00b5l reaction volume comprising 10 \u00b5l of 5 \u00d7 reaction buffer, 3 \u00b5l of 1.5 M MgCl2, 5 \u00b5l of 10 mM dNTP, 3 \u00b5l of 100 pmol primers, 26 \u00b5l of distilled water and 3 \u00b5l (2 ng/ \u00b5l) of template DNA. The PCR amplification was performed using 2720 PCR Thermo Cycler and the temperature profile was maintained as initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles (denaturation 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing 51 \u00b0C for 30 s and extension 72 \u00b0C for 2 min). The final extension was carried out at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min and held at 4 \u00b0C. The PCR amplification of the ITS region was verified by electrophoresis (10 \u03bcL) and the rest of the PCR products (40 \u03bcl) were purified according to requirement of Cambridge Genomic Services (The University of Cambridge, UK) for DNA sequencing. Multiple BLASTN searches against the sequence were made at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Consensus sequences were submitted in the GenBank. Primarily, Clustal Omega was employed for Multiple Sequence Alignment and further followed by trimming using trimAI tool for later alignment.

Resazurin solution (4 mg of resazurin was dissolved in 20 mL of sterile distilled water) was used in this assay as an indicator of cell growth. Briefly, sterile 96 well plates were prepared and labeled under aseptic conditions. A volume of 100 \u00b5l of test material in 10% (v/v) DMSO (10 mg/ml for crude extracts) was pipetted into the first row of the plate and 50 \u00b5l of normal saline was added to all other wells. Serial dilutions were performed in such that each well had 50 \u00b5l of the test material in serially descending concentrations. 30 \u00b5l nutrient broth and 10 \u00b5l of resazurin indicator solution were added to each well. Finally, 10 \u00b5l of bacterial suspension (5 \u00d7 105 cfu/ml) was added to each well. To prevent the bacterial culture dehydration, each plate was wrapped loosely with cling film. Each plate had a column with a broad-spectrum of antibiotic as positive control (usually ciprofloxacin in serial dilution) a column with all solutions with the exception of the bacterial solution adding 10 \u00b5l of nutrient broth instead. The plates were prepared in triplicates, and placed in an incubator set at 37 \u00b0C for 18\u201324 h. The color change was then assessed visually. Any color changes from purples to pink or colorless were recorded as positive. The lowest concentration at which color change occurred was taken as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value. The average of three values was calculated and that was the MIC for the test materials.",

The maximum pair-wise genetic distance (0.927) was found between SaL11 (A. niger) and SaR7 (F. equiseti). The result can be justifying by reason that they both are from different genus. Although three Alternaria spp. and two Cladosporium species were present but the maximum similarity was found in between SaL5 (Alternaria arborescens) and SaF5 (Epicoccum nigrum). A UPGMA tree was constructed (Fig. 3) from these distance matrix using the software PUAP 4.0. The UPGMA tree of 12 isolated endophytic fungi shows two main clusters. Cluster one consisted with eight fungi viz. SaL11 (A. niger), SaL2 (Alternaria brassicicola), SaR7 (F. equiseti), SaR9 (Cladosporium cladosporioides), SaR1 (Xenoacremonium recifei), SaL13 (Cladosporium perangustum), SaL9 (Colletotrichum glosporides) and SaF1 (Cladosporium tenuissimum). The second cluster was consisted with four fungi and they are SaL5 (A. arborescens), SaF5 (E. nigrum), SaL4 (A. tenuissima) and SaB6 (Neopestalotiopsis chrysea).",

The findings of this study also suggest that endophytes from harsh and competitive environments, such as mangrove ecosystem, might be an attractive source for new anti-infective compounds. Xing et al. has recently reported Mycospharerella spp., Fusarium spp. Glomerella spp., Phomopsis spp., and Pestalotiopsis microspore from S. apetala (Xing et al. 2011). The present work is the first report of endophytic fungi A. tenuissima, A. brassicicola, A. arborescens, C. cladosporioides, C. perangustum, C. tenuissimum, E. nigrum, N. chrysea, X. recifei and A. niger isolated from S. apetala. In the present study, Fusarium sp. inhibited both bacteria and fungi with lowest MIC, which was in agreement with the information reported in a previous study that demonstrated Fusarium sp. isolated from Saussurea involucrata with broad antimicrobial spectrum (Lv et al. 2010). In another study, endophytic fungi isolates from twelve mangrove species were found to be diverse. Similar to our study, the study reported the extraction of fungal broth by ethyl acetate while the mycelia were extracted using methanol, hexane and ethyl acetate in sequence, respectively (Buatong et al. 2011). Ethyl acetate is widely used in extraction of endophytic fungal cultures (Bhardwaj et al. 2015; Minarni et al. 2017) followed by methanol. As a solvent, ethyl acetate solvent possesses medium polarity so that it has the ability to dissolve both polar and non-polar active compounds and methanol solvent being a polar solvent can dissolve almost all organic compounds, even polar, semi polar and non-polar (Rahmawati et al. 2018). However, apart from separation of compounds, the solvents had no effect on antimicrobial potential of the fungal extracts as the extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure using rotary evaporator.",

The ITS regions circumscribe two non-coding regions ITS1 and ITS2, which are separated by the highly conserved 5.8S rRNA gene (Crouch et al. 2009). The ITS1 and ITS2 regions are more variable than the other adjacent rRNA gene sequences (Ciardo et al. 2006). Therefore, offer a better identification of closely related species.
