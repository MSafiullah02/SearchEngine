The complexity of the disease becomes more apparent when it is revealed that certain segments of the population are more susceptible to severe infection and subsequently to death [14] . The responses of innate and adaptive immune systems make the base of the host anti-microbial defense. In order to quickly control and effectively deal with the viral infection, the innate immune system operates and simultaneously triggers the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system distinguishes influenza viruses through multiple mechanisms [15] . This system, which is programmed genetically for meeting the similar features of attacking microbes, acts rapidly and protects the body against infection early.",

Influenza virus targets airway epithelial cells lining the respiratory mucosa. After infecting and lysing these cells, the virus of influenza A can infect alveolar macrophages and DCs residing in the airway [15] . As soon as sensing infection, DCs taking up viral antigens operate the main function in priming effector T cell responses [15, 16] . After activation, influenza virus-specified CD4 and CD8 T cells operate together with antibody-generating B cells to elevate viral release in the lung [15, 17] . T cells are principal moderators of the immune response and handle their performances by modulating the functions of other immune cells and modifying the behavior of parenchymal and endothelial cells [18] . In the case of COVID-19, after entering cells, the virus's antigen will be introduced to the antigen presentation cells, which are among the main parts of the body's antiviral immunity [19] .",

            "text": "It is found that CAMs are effective in boosting immune response vs. diseases. Several cases of CAMs proposed for prohibiting and curing diseases are discussed in this section. It has been suggested that as a CAM, curcumin, a polyphenolic compound extracted from spice and common food colourant turmeric [23] , can enhance the antibody response even if it takes at low doses [24] . In fact, the beneficial effects of curcumin in improving different diseases are attributed partly to its ability to modulate the immune system [24] . Furthermore, several surveys demonstrate that curcumin is able to modulate both the activation and the proliferation of T cells [25, 26] . It has also been shown that curcumin has the potential of regulating the growth and response of different immune cells. It affects NK cells, T cells, B cells, DCs, neutrophils, and macrophages [24] . CAMs have also found to be effective in infectious diseases [27, 23] . In Ref. [23] , the authors investigated the synergic effect of curcumin and its structural analogue (Monoacetylcurcumin) on anti-influenza virus infection. They found that, as with curcumin, Monoacetylcurcumin effectively inhibited influenza virus infection (IVA). The anti-influenza activity of curcumin was evaluated by Ref. [28] . The results of this study demonstrated that treatment of curcumin reduces influenza A viruses replication, affects an early stage of virus infection, and blocks haemagglutinating activity of IAV virus particles. Overall, they recommend that curcumin has promising potential for using as an anti-influenza drug. According to the previous research on antiviral potential of curcumin, the effectiveness of curcumin at very early stage of viral infection has been proven in a non-enveloped virus, human norovirus (HuNoV) [29] . The study by Ref. [30] demonstrated that antiviral mechanisms such as viral entry, rather than RNA replication of HuNoV, can be found by treatment of curcumin at various doses and durations. In addition [31] , found the effectiveness of curcumin on various enveloped viruses such as vaccinia virus, IAV, and pseudorabies virus.",

These are mostly accompanied with CAMs, which include a group of various medic and health care orders, actions, and supplies not classified as a part of conventional medicines. Nutritional supplements appear to strengthen the immune system profiting transient immunosuppression that results from intense training [32] . It has been demonstrated that vitamin C [33] , vitamin D [34] and zinc [35] boost the immune system versus viruses. Two assays executed in South Africa have shown promising results about vitamin C supplementation [32, 36] . Vitamin D has also considerable effect on immune system. It has been demonstrated that vitamin D modulates innate and adaptive immune systems [9, 37] . Both immune systems are adjusted by vitamin D, which suppresses the adaptive immune system but potents the innate immune response [9] . In Ref. [38] , it is stated that vitamin D has reinforcing and inhibitory effects for the innate and adaptive immune systems, respectively. In Ref. [39] , it is also stated that vitamin D, which has anti-inflammatory properties and modulates immunity in different ways, is effective in physiology and autoimmunity, and its deficiency is associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. Epidemiological surveys have confirmed that poor vitamin D consumption adheres to the raised risk of multiple diseases including autoimmune drawbacks. It seems that the immune regulatory effect of vitamin D has a significant role in this adherence. Adaptive immune cells are direct targets of vitamin D metabolites [40] . In fact, as concluded in Ref. [41] , vitamin D is part of a complex set of factors that influence the immune response. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the serum level of vitamin D in children and the elderly and to maintain it at optimum levels and micronutrients should be used for improving health and fighting diseases.",

Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, no clinically confirmed antiviral drug has been introduced for SARS-CoV-2 infection yet [19] . According to Ref. [47] , down-regulation of gene expression related to antigen presentation due to MERS-CoV infection demonstrates that coronavirus can affect on the antigen presentation.

It seems necessary to activate the body's maximum antioxidant capacity and natural immunity to minimize the symptoms of any virus attack. Vitamin C can be administered concurrently with potential medications to treat the disease in acute conditions. The oral administration of vitamin C up to the daily threshold of bowel tolerance will be effective for most people. For serious cases, intravenous infusion of vitamin C is recommended. Besides, it is claimed that the overactivity of immune cells results in lung injury following COVID-19 pneumonia. Some published open-label studies also recommend that intravenous injection of high-dose vitamin C can be a safe and useful option for treatment COVID-19 in its early stages.",

Further, as stated in Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) [48] , there is no clinical investigation and evidence to support intravenous high-dose vitamin C in the management of COVID-19 and more research is needed before any recommendation for the use of intravenous vitamin C in the treatment of COVID-19 can be made.

According to the previous research, the immune system has a fundamental protective function against most infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. The effectiveness of CAMs in boosting immune response against infection diseases has been extensively investigated. This study has also investigated the role of CAMs in infectious diseases and COVID-19. Specifically, an attempt has been made to clarify whether or not the use of vitamins has the potential to help to prevent and/or treat COVID-19. This study according to the previous research found that the use of CAMs can be an effective way in boosting immune response against the infections. In addition, it was found that the use of vitamins, in general, is beneficial in improving immune health and function. However, as a few clinical investigations show the effectiveness of CAMs in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, further studies through clinical and consumers' experience analysis on CAMs are required to come to robust conclusions in the effectiveness of CAMs for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.",
