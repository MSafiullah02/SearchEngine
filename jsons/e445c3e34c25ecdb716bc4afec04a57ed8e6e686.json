By 2013, over 1 billion consumers worldwide owned some form of a smart phone. 2 With the subsequent advent and infiltration of social media into the backbone of modern-day culture, the fundamental right of freedom of speech has both been challenged and solidified and, for better or worse, has facilitated exponentially \"freedom of reach\".",

            "text": "Almost every aspect of our lives has been affected by these incredible advances, not least the way we educate and learn. Millennial medical learners (those born 1981-2000) have grown up with personal computers and smartphones and have quite different expectations for the way they train and learn. 3 For example, in a recent online survey of adult CHD trainees, respondents stated they were more likely to search information online (58%) than consult a faculty member (29%) or textbook (3%). Over two-thirds of respondents stated they used their smartphones at least once daily to search for information during regular clinical work. 4 In light of the current coronavirus pandemic, with mass cancellations of international, national, and regional conferences as well as institutional grand rounds and weekly trainee lectures, the world of academic medicine is rethinking how to distribute new scientific ideas and maintain the necessary ongoing education of trainees and practising physicians. 5 To meet these changing educational needs and desires, e-learning programmes are now becoming increasingly more commonplace in higher education, including in continuing medical education. However, there remain significant barriers to implementing online learning programmes. Attitudinal barriers cannot be underestimated when considering both those involved in teaching (a nostalgia for the classroom), as well as sometimes in the learner (some modern learners still prefer the printed page). However, more and more lectures are now recorded for subsequent online posting. While these cannot replace textbooks, such recorded lectures are supplementary and are becoming the norm for many university-based graduate and postgraduate degree courses. That said, we do need to look at education through a worldwide lens, and while access is growing in almost all countries, consistent quality education remains a barrier for those particularly in most low-and middle-income regions. This is especially true regarding specialty and sub-specialty education. 6, 7 These barriers often have identifiable solutions. 8 For instance, even in areas with limited access to computers and poor physical infrastructure, a break-even cost analysis by Maloney and colleagues 9 found that the web-based approach to learning was superior to the traditional face-to-face education. Consequently, when resources are limited, investment in e-learning may, paradoxically, be a cheaper solution than a \"bricks and mortar\" approach.",

Furthermore, while some studies have shown benefit in e-learning for medical education when compared to traditional learning, a recent Cochrane review of the limited randomised controlled trials comparing e-learning to traditional learning for medical education concluded that e-learning may make little or no difference in patient outcomes or health professionals' behaviours, skills, or knowledge. 10 Nonetheless, \"non-inferiority\" of e-learning is probably adequate enough to sustain and expand this now-expected approach of today's learners. There is likely no going back, and so looking forward we should be customising and enhancing the e-learning experience, a philosophy that was the bedrock of the formation of Heart University (Fig 1) .",

The original aim was to provide open access to high-quality educational resources for cardiology trainees, cardiologists, and healthcare professionals interested in learning more about adult patients with CHDs. These aims were supported by both an expressed need from providers for further instruction to care for such patients effectively, 11 as well as the understanding that poorer outcomes in adults with CHD are associated with care provided by general cardiologists who are not educated in caring for these patients. 12 The ACHD Learning Center rapidly outperformed its most optimistic expectations. From its inception in 2012 up to the creation of Heart University in the spring of 2017, the ACHD Learning Center had accrued over 2000 users from 36 countries, including 42 academic programmes requiring use of the training modules by their trainees, with over 10,000 self-assessment tests taken.",

This White Paper that you are now reading represents one component of the multiple components of the partnership between Heart University and Cardiology in the Young. Several members of the Editorial Boards of Heart University have been appointed to the Editorial Board of Cardiology in the Young, including Justin T. Tretter, Rohit S. Loomba, and Andrew N. Redington. These common members of the Editorial Boards will assure ongoing alignment of the missions of Heart University and Cardiology in the Young. Another area of collaboration is that Heart University will begin to feature White Papers, Guideline Papers, and Landmark Papers published in Cardiology in the Young. 18, 22, 23 Approximately every 4 months, Cardiology in the Young will provide Heart University with a new \"hot of the press\" major paper that is published in Cardiology in the Young. Heart University will post and highlight this paper on the Heart University site. A discussion board surrounding the paper will be established and the lead author of the manuscript will be invited to moderate the discussion. Finally, bidirectional hyperlinks will be established between the websites of Heart University and Cardiology in the Young. The leadership of Heart University and Cardiology in the Young are currently actively exploring additional opportunities for collaboration.",

From February 2019 to June 2019, user feedback was collected and used to improve upon the organisation, graphical design, and navigation of the site. During this trial period, the number of registered users increased to 3200 users from 75 countries and 6 continents.

A clear limitation to providing a large amount of material readily available online with no structured plan for navigating through the material and assessing mastery of the content is that the user may become complacent, with little motivation to work comprehensively through the outlined curriculums. The end result is a broad superficial familiarity with a topic without a mastery of its fundamental concepts. We are working to build in some rigour into the process of online learning through certification courses that mandate answering questions relating to the topic material (i.e., Certification in Cardiac Anatomy). The site eventually aims to provide continued medical education credit for practising providers, navigating the various specific international requirements. We additionally are actively pursuing a means to provide objective credit and applicable analytical feedback for content creators of learning modules that will be pertinent for career advancement. While our focus is to continue to improve upon and fill the gaps of the current three component sites, we have also been in discussion with other international organisations wishing to create component sites specific to their specialties, e.g., congenital cardiac surgery and cardiac anaesthesia.",

The textbook is not yet dead, and we hope it never will be, but online learning and access to educational material is already a key component of our everyday lives, and one that will only increase in the future. With the current coronavirus pandemic, there has never been more urgency than now to establish options for supplemental online learning.
