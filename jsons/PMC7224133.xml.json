However, SARS-CoV-2-infected Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice had an increased infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung, suggesting that an active, functional and immediate type I IFN response restricts pathogenesis in mice. The analysis of hamsters with a deletion of Stat2 (which causes a loss of type I and type III IFN signalling) or of Il28r (resulting in loss of type III IFN signalling alone) suggested that type III IFNs help to restrict viral dissemination, whereas type I IFNs exacerbate bronchopneumonia in hamsters. These opposing roles warrant further study, and the histological findings suggest that the Syrian hamster is a better model for COVID-19 than the mouse.",
