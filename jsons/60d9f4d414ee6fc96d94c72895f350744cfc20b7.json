We conducted a systematic review of the published literature and preprints on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak following predefined eligibility criteria. Of 317 research articles generated from our initial search on PubMed and preprint archives on 21 February 2020, 41 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Current evidence suggests that it takes about 3-7 days for the epidemic to double in size. Of 21 estimates for the basic reproduction number ranging from 1.9 to 6.5, 13 were between 2.0 and 3.0. The incubation period was estimated to be 4-6 days, whereas the serial interval was estimated to be 4-8 days. Though the true case fatality risk is yet unknown, current model-based estimates ranged from 0.3% to 1.4% for outside China. There is an urgent need for rigorous research focusing on the mitigation efforts to minimize the impact on society.",

Earlier analyses using a relatively small number of laboratory-confirmed patients in Wuhan in January reported an overall CFR of 11% [4] and 15% [42] . More recently, the analysis of 44,672 patients reported an overall CFR of 2.3% [39] , which is much lower than that from earlier analyses and that for other coronaviruses (9.6% for SARS-CoV [43] and 34.5% for MERS-CoV [44] ). The study showed that most cases (81%) had mild symptoms, while 14% developed severe conditions and the remaining 5% fell critically ill. Severity increased with age, and the CFR was highest (14.8%) in individuals aged 80 and above. The CFR was higher among individuals with underlying chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), or chronic respiratory diseases (6.3%) than among individuals with no pre-existing conditions (0.9%). Another study on pediatric patients reported that most children with COVID-19 had developed mild symptoms, such as fever and cough, with good prognoses for recovery [45] .",

A mathematical modeling study [8] showed that a 25% reduction in transmissibility from the nationwide implementation of control measures would lead to a 50% reduction in the magnitude of the epidemic and a one month delay in the epidemic peak. The study, however, found that citywide quarantine in Wuhan in which all inbound and outbound mobility were to be eliminated would have little effects because local epidemics may have already occurred in other provinces across China by then [8] . Similarly, another published study concluded that the quarantine of exposed individuals identified through contact tracing in Wuhan had little effect in reducing the number of infections and slowing down the epidemic across China [18] . Incorporating the possibility of pre-symptomatic transmission in simulating the spread of COVID19 across China with different levels of quarantining, a recent preprint highlighted that the effectiveness of quarantine largely depends on when it is implemented and the proportion in quarantine. The study suggested that the quarantine rate should be at least 63% (threshold) for the epidemic to be averted [13] and that such strong control measures should be kept in place over the course of the outbreak.",

More recent analyses in preprint used a much larger sample that includes up to 468 pairs [35] , making their estimates of between 4 to 5 days more statistically reliable (given that all methodologies are sound and valid) with a smaller margin of errors. As highlighted in the literature, a serial interval shorter than the incubation period could imply pre-symptomatic transmission and thereby should be considered in formulating intervention strategies, as it may impede containment efforts. The serial interval estimates for SARS-CoV-2 is also shorter than that of SARS-CoV (8.4 days) [25] and MERS-CoV (8-13 days) [34, 38] , which suggests that it may be more challenging to contain the spread compared to other coronaviruses.",

According to the latest statistics, the observed mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be around 4.8% worldwide [1] . The mortality rate in the five most affected countries largely varies across countries, from as low as 1.0% for Germany to 11.4% for Italy [1] . However, it is possible that estimates for countries with relatively recent local establishment may be overestimated and vary between them. It is because during the initial stage of an outbreak, severe cases are more likely to be picked up by health authorities, while the vast majority of cases with no or mild symptoms are left undetected.",

The effectiveness of these containment measures in controlling the outbreak, however, remains inconclusive. Current evidence from modeling studies on COVID-19 suggests that travel restrictions leading to reduced transmissibility can be highly effective in containing the spread. While school closure is less effective than workplace distancing or quarantine of exposed individuals, a combined strategy which implements all three measures together was found to be most effective in reducing the spread. Airport screening is shown to be not as effective either, detecting only 34% [52] to 54% [51] of infected travelers through thermal scanning. An important implication to this is that the effectiveness of such control measures could be further hampered by a significant portion of asymptomatic patients (17.9%, 95% CrI: 15.5-20.2%) [49] and pre-symptomatic transmission (12.1%), as evidenced from early analyses [35, 36] .",

For example, we found only two published studies with an estimate for the serial interval using a small number of samples. Including five more estimates from preprints gave greater confidence of the means and distributions for the epidemiological parameters as they had bigger sample sizes with more data becoming available. It should also be noted that of preprints, we included only those that provided sound rationales for the methodology they used in the form of a complete manuscript.",
