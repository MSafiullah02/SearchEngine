Holistic frameworks that build tourism resilience in post-conflict destinations is still considered an emerging area in crisis management research. This paper aims to address this gap. An in-depth critique of research across leading peer-reviewed tourism journals, involving 102 individual papers; 63 on crises and disasters, and 39 on tourism recovery frameworks, was undertaken to develop a post-conflict tourism recovery framework. The framework proposed synthesizes complex relationships for post-conflict destinations operating \"on the edge of chaos\", and enables consideration of key factors that influence their capacity to be resilient, adapt, and recover.",

First, a comprehensive review of tourism studies that considered the impacts of natural and humaninduced disasters on tourism over the past 20 years was conducted to understand their impact on destinations and the attempt made to understand the theoretical underpinning and issues of vulnerability and resilience. The review reflects a growing interest across the academic community in this research area given the major implications that crises have on the tourism industry. The authors acknowledge that extant research may have been undertaken on specific disasters and crisis published in journals worldwide and online, but focus in this review was on 63 tourism studies specifically focused on natural and humaninduced disasters that occurred in both developed as well as less-developed countries, and were published in peer-reviewed journals (see Figure 1 and Appendix 1).",

Disasters were included given that not all disasters are naturally occurring. This review was purposely limited to the top three (1) a specific keywords search for \"Crisis\", \"Management\" AND \"Framework\" in the journal article's title, abstract and keywords; (2) a 1999-2019 time frame; and (3) relevance of the paper to the analysis of tourism crisis management frameworks and models. In order to reflect the wide range of research in the field of crisis management and frameworks applied in tourism, a further six articles were identified from other sources following a \"snowball\" approach. The identification and selection of these six peer-reviewed articles was realised through a process of screening based on frequency of citations (e.g., McKercher, 2008; McKercher & Tung, 2015) and relevance to the analysis. These included work by Evans & Elphick (2005) , de Sausmarez (2007) , Scott, Laws & Prideaux (2007) , Sonmez and Graefe (1998) , Pennington-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Crises threaten the existence of any system, \"whether it is a nation state, social community, government, organisation, natural environment, eco-system or some other established system (including tourism)\" (Ritchie, 2009, p.8) . To a certain extent, there is a degree of 'predictability' with a crises. In contrast, Prideaux, Laws and Faulkner (2003, p.478) argue that a disaster is an \"unpredictable catastrophic change that can normally only be responded to after the event, either by deploying contingency plans already in place or through reactive response\". As a result, in recent years, the response to a disaster or crisis has become increasingly proactive, predominantly focusing on risk reduction mechanisms that aim to reduce people's vulnerability to natural disasters or conflicts (Hilhorst, 2013 ). However, as Faulkner (2001 highlighted, \"one of the reasons so little progress has been made in the advancing of our understanding of tourism crises is the limited development of the theoretical and conceptual frameworks required to underpin the analysis of this phenomena\". An analysis of current crisis management approaches in tourism demonstrates J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f relationships existing between and within the tourism destinations. Hence, a complexitybased perspective on tourism crises as an alternative to a more conventional approach to tourism destination management may provide a better understanding of tourism crises management and planning.",

Although chaos and complexity theory have been used interchangeably in the literature (Farsari, Butler & Szivas, 2011; McDonald, 2009 ), Manson (2001 argues that complexity theory research contends several perspectives and approaches to complexity with \"sometimes conflicting assumptions and conclusions\". The authors argue that those most relevant to the discussion presented in this paper include, 'deterministic complexity' (related to chaos and catastrophe theory) and 'aggregate complexity' (related to complex system theory and emphasizing holism and synergy resulting from the interaction of the system components). The former relates to chaotic systems that are characterised by features such as the butterfly effect, bifurcation, and feedback (Manson, 2001) . The latter concerns complex systems which are determined by the relationships rather than by its constituted components (Farsari et al., 2011; Manson, 2001) .",

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Many tourism academics, however, have argued that it is inappropriate to consider tourism as a stable and balanced system since tourism is in fact subject to constant fluctuation and uncertainty (Baggio, 2008; Faulkner & Goeldner, 1998) . McKercher (1999, p. 426) expressed criticism of conventional research and its consideration of systems as \"expectable, stable, orderly, and conducive to linear change\" and instead viewed them as \"complex and uncontrollable, characterized by nonlinear, non-deterministic chaotic behavior\".

A destination is hence recognised as an unstable, dynamic system which is subject to non-linear relationships (Scott & Laws, 2005) . Any triggering internal and external events, either natural or human-induced, can challenge the existent structure of the tourism destination and redirect it into new dynamic paths. The characteristics of the dynamic systems thus make it impossible to accurately forecast any long-term future evolution, especially when the system is on the \"edge of chaos\" or moves from one phase to another (Baggio & Sainaghi, 2011) .",

From a complexity perspective, a tourism system can be dislocated from its steady state condition by a triggering event and this situation is referred to as chaos, \"which is as random and unpredictable as the outcome\" (Russell & Faulkner, 2004, p.557) . Several features of a chaotic system seem to be relevant to our discussion here, namely the 'edge-of-chaos', 'bifurcation', 'self-organizing', 'butterfly effect ' and 'lock-in effect' (Boukas & Ziakas, 2014; Faulkner, 2000; McKercher, 1999; Russell & Faulkner, 2004) .",

'Selforganising\" involves self-referencing, increased capacity, and interdependent organising (Lichtenstein, 2000) where the system becomes more \"suitable\" to deal with internal or external difficulties as it benefits from more optimised available resources (Baggio & Sainaghi, 2011) . If successful, the crisis enters a resolution stage, returning to a state of 'business as usual' (Paraskevas, 2006) . However, new and coherent structures and patterns may emerge (Speakman, 2017) , and thus a return to normality is not necessarily feasible or desired. \"Butterfly effect\" refers to situations when minor changes can lead to a chain of reaction that culminates in larger outcomes (Faulkner, 2000; Russell & Faulkner, 2004; McKercher, 1999 ). An example of this being Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption in Iceland in 2010 and the impact it had on global aviation industry. According to McKercher (1999) , in a tourism context, the butterfly effect explains how similar destinations can evolve in different ways, reflecting the unpredictable nature of tourism development where small changes in the initial conditions can lead to completely different outcomes. Lastly, 'lock-in-effect' relates to the persistence of certain inherited innovations regardless of the changes in the system. For",

It takes on different forms, including engineering, ecological and evolutionary resilience (Davoudi et al., 2013; Folke et al., 2010; Hall, Prayag & Amore, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f system returns to its previous equilibrium or steady state after a disturbance. The more resilient the system is, the faster it bounces back (Davoudi, 2012) . Engineering resilience focuses on the \"attributes of efficiency, constancy and predictability\" of complicated systems (Hall et al., 2018, p.41) . Ecological resilience focuses on the \"core attributes of persistence, change and unpredictability\" of complex systems and considers the magnitude of the disturbance that can be absorbed by a system before it changes its structure (Hall et al., 2018) . This is, how much disturbance a system can take in order to remain within its critical thresholds. Evolutionary resilience challenges the entire idea of equilibrium by suggesting Applying 'adaptive cycle' thinking to crises has great utlilty, namely, the ability to react to external stimuli and modify behaviour accordingly. Shocks, disturbance and changes are seen as important factors in unlocking opportunities for the reorganisation of any system (Biggs, Schluter & Schoon, 2015) , where governance and management can enhance resilience and allow adaptive responses to unexpected events. Biggs et al. (2015) argue that systems with particularly high levels of diversity tend to be more resilient than those associated with low diversity, although this also implies an increasing complexity and inefficiency that may J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f including developing crisis communication strategies (e.g., Liu-Lastres et al., 2018; M\u00f6ller et al., 2018) to rebuild destination image and recover markets.",

In this respect, vulnerability is seen as \"a loose antonym\" (Adger, 2000, p.348) to resilience. Moreover, Miller et al., (2010) argue that resilience and vulnerability, although linked, are two different approaches to understanding the response of systems and actors to change. The existing differences in approaches come from their origins in ecological theory (resilience) and social theory (vulnerability), respectively. The former being a systemic approach while the latter involves community prefering an actor-oriented approach (Miller et al., 2010) .",

This is evidenced in Lew's (2014) scale, change and resilience model for tourism and resilience planning. The model is centred on the idea that different groups (private entrepreneurs, local and regional governments) have a different focus in addressing resilience issues. Their perception and implicit management of slow change is different than under sudden major shocks to these systems.

However, they found that a country's political regime, its dependence on tourism and level of national income does have an influence on tourism destination resilience to terrorism. Crouch and Ritchie (1999) outlined a series of determining factors that can affect a destination, usually beyond the control or influence of the tourism sector. These include the location, cost of a destination and dependencies between destinations, as location cannot be changed and cost is largely driven by socio-economic and global forces. The effects of war in one part of the world can affect and disturb tourism industries far from the origin of conflict. Adger (2000) found that the disruption to livelihoods and loss of security for local communities due to war or civil conflict, accentuate social vulnerability.",

However, a resilient system adapts to change by building adaptive capacity in the face of unanticipated and anticipated disruptions. This is a critical ability for a tourism system since conflicts, and respectively political instability, unlike natural disasters, impact the tourism industry and the image of a destination more significantly and for longer periods of time (Pizam & Mansfeld, 2005) . They affect the capacity of tourism destinations to adapt to changes and 'bounce-back' from crises. Hence, it is vital to better understand the relationship between resilience, tourism crisis and tourism recovery in conflict-ridden areas (Issac, Cakmak, & Butler, 2019), concepts that have shaped the development of the conceptual framework are presented later in the paper.",

Moreover, Hall According to general theories, a crisis advances in stages. For instance, Fink (1986) considered that a crisis follows four stages that are categorised prodromal (warning), acute (at the height of the crisis), chronic (aftermath), and resolution.

The process commences with a \"pre-event phase\", when action can be taken to prevent or mitigate the consequences of a disaster, followed by a \"prodromal\" state in which the disaster is imminent. The \"emergency phase\" refers to the time when actions are taken to protect life and property, followed by an \"intermediate phase\", a \"long-term recovery phase\" and a \"resolution phase\" in which routine is restored or a new improved state emerges. His tourism crises management model also J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f models that have a broad research focus, addressing a multiplicity of concepts and aspects (see Figure 3) . Some of the models analysed consider crises as having a distinct start and finish with a desirable end of a crisis as a return to normality. This idea is supported by the use of crisis stages to divide time into a before (pre-crisis) and after (post-crisis). Scott & Laws (2005) and Scott et al., (2007) argue that an alternative systems perspective offers a better representation of a crisis. A crisis is thus seen as an evolving system where change (both positive and negative) is endemic and not limited to only its immediate temporal or geographic locality. In addition, these changes cannot be planned as part of a strategic management as they also may lead to different stages. As a result, the subsequent system may be different than the previous one and, consequently, a return to normality is not always the required endpoint (Scott & Laws, 2005) .",

Thus, tourism acts as a \"force for world peace\"(D'Amore, 1988). Some researchers, however, have questioned the role of tourism in areas affected by conflict and as a result, two types of research studies have emerged. There are studies advocating tourism as an agent for creating and facilitating rapport between divided communities (Causevic, 2010; Sonmez & Apostolopoulos, 2000) and as a confidence building measure encouraging cooperation (Simone-Charteris & Boyd, 2010) . Conversely, opponents to tourism as a contributor to peace argue that tourism is a beneficiary of peace, rather than grounds for peace (Pratt & Liu, 2016) . Tourism by itself does not implicitly contribute to tourists' positive attitudinal changes or prejudice attenuation. This only happens under certain conditions, such as a quality tourist experience (Pizam et al., 2002) , a situation that may not be always scalable from individuals to whole nations (Pratt & Lui, 2016) .",

It also often takes decades for tourists to return to a country following a conflict event and some countries never fully recover from perceptions of violence and instability (e.g., Israel, see Pizam and Mansfeld, 2005) , whereas others recover quickly through a strategy that downplays their war-torn image (e.g., Croatia and Slovenia, see Naef & Ploner, 2016) . A strategy to dissociate the country's image from its war heritage by removing any vestiges of the recent war (Arnaud, 2016; Rivera, 2008 ) may come at a cost as destinations fail to differentiate from others nearby and may exacerbate political tensions at home.",

Second, while adaptive systems thinking has been applied to tourism management (Farrell & Twining-Ward, 2004; Ritchie, 2004) , it has not been considered in situations of conflict and political instability. Such an approach enables a deeper understanding of the change process. Third, with a few exceptions (e.g., Novelli, Morgan & Nibigira, 2012; Boukas & Ziakas, 2014; Dahles & Susilowati, 2015; Buultjens, Ratnayake & Gnanapala, 2016) , there has been a notable absence of consideration of complexity theory and resilience thinking to situational cases of political instability and armed conflict. Resilience from a tourism perspective, has been predominantly linked to natural disasters and economic crises, sustainability and climate change research. There is, however, scope to explore the synergy between the application of complex adaptive systems and resilience theory and then apply these to crises. Fourth, there is a lack of research that examines crises from a nonlinear perspective. Too much emphasis has been on the development of 'deterministic models' (McKercher, 1999) . Crises involve different stages and are often an unpredictable and evolving phenomena that can cause restructuring of entire tourism systems. This requires a different approach, offering new paradigms and theoretical frameworks to be developed that conceptualise a tourism crises as a dynamic phenomenon.",

The authors have taken an approach based on adaptive cycle theory (Holling, 2001; Walker, Holling, Carpenter & Kinzig, 2004 ) that accommodates growth, stability, reorganisation and transformation of any tourism system. The outcomes that can be triggered by major disturbances are characterised as high magnitude and of long duration (e.g., conflicts and political instability). The framework also adopts a systems approach toward understanding a tourism system, its sub-systems (socio-ecological, socio-technical and sociopolitical) and the interactions between these responding to change (positive or negative) by self-organising. This self-organising can be either through adoption of a Phoenix state directly after conflict has ceased, a state where there is openness to new approaches, innovation and learning or it can be through reorganisation which leads to a tourism system with characteristics that resemble mature destinations that have never experienced conflict (see Boyd, 2019a&b). The self-organising in the framework refers to the system's adaptive response to change in a post-conflict environment.",

This framework is designed for destinations that have suffered from long-term crises as opposed to short-term turbulence and unrest, where the interim Phoenix phase of recovery may be more relevant for some destinations over others that have chosen to position recovery around re-development of past tourism assets that the region was known for preconflict. The former applies to Northern Ireland where the focus was on development of a dark heritage product of murals and dissonance community heritage that as a product base contrasted with a more diversified tourism offer by tourism bodies, which would later see niche development normalise around food tourism, screen tourism and golf tourism (Boyd, 2019b) . A Phoenix phase of development can also be noted for Medellin, Colombia, with its focus on narco heritage, the development of new tourism products such as comuna tours (peripheral neighbourhoods), and the dark romanticism of Pablo tours (Naef, 2018) . This narrow Phoenix base contrasts with wider opportunity to develop bird-based (avian) tourism in Colombia recognised to have the greatest bird diversity of any country in the world.",

While it has been specifically applied to one sub-type of crises, that of conflict, it has wider utility to other types of crises. Key here is how a destination adapts (adaptive capacity), moves directly to exhibit the characteristics of mature destinations that have never faced any past major disturbance, or adopts a transitory 'Phoenix' phase of initial recovery. What is important in the framework is the role that vulnerability and resilience play. As discussed previously, the framework offers considerable scope for new research to test empirically the nature of relationships that exist between different component parts. The authors invite scholarly research into investigating casual linkages as well as operationalising the framework in varied conflict-ridden destinations. For instance, those that have faced a long protracted image crises and subsequent conflict (e.g., Israel-Palestine) compared to those that have faced the re-emergence of short-duration conflict (e.g., Egypt during the Arab Spring, and recent Easter violence and unrest in Sri Lanka). The authors are cognizant that crises vary in their duration and their intensity and that the wider applicability of some aspects of the framework will vary according to the destination and conflict under study. Destinations where conflict has reemerged but where that has been short in duration can be examined from the standpoint of their ability to be adaptive, resilient to and quickly recover to a condition similar to what they enjoyed prior to conflict. In contrast, for destinations that have been torn apart by protracted civil war, there exist greater scope to research how such destinations began their recovery and the extent to which this relied on an interim Phoenix stage.",

            "text": "A multi-perspective approach to understanding crises has practical implications for many stakeholders involved in destinations that are looking to recover. Policy makers need to be able to explore different strategies of response, where a 'Phoenix' phased recovery is favoured or not. This may involve developing appropriate crisis communication strategies that help to facilitate repositioning as well as evaluating tourist reactions on how successful they see those recovery strategies to be, and how they shape the type of tourism development taking place. Local communities and their voices need better understanding, especially if the recovery strategy is to have some deliberate association with the past conflict. The inputs from these different stakeholder groups will inform researchers of the characteristics of a Phoenix type destination or one that normalises around its recovery and renewal. Crises are unwelcome events facing tourism. Regarding conflicts as crises, adopting a holistic and multi-perspective framework offers researchers with much needed insight into how destinations can develop and manage post-conflict.",

This raises the question as \"to the reactive nature of tourism research versus the development of greater predictive capacity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and theory generation\" (Hall, 2010, p.406). While the focus pre 2010 was selective, researchers over the past decade have addressed environmental crises from the standpoint of environmental sustainability, environmental change and adaptation (Kutzner, 2019) and building organizational and enterprise resilience (Biggs et al., 2019). Other scholars have examined particular environmental catastrophes such as oil spills from the Deepwater Horizon (Pennington-Gray, et al., 2011) and the challenges of conservation regarding the Great Barrier Reef (Biggs et al., 2012). The latter evidence of research suggests movement towards being more proactive and predictive. The early thinking by Faulkner (2001) and Ritchie (2004) who developed more generic and strategic models for tourism crisis management were cognizant of the need for theory and framework generation that was both proactive and have predictive capacity. Referring to these models, de Sausmarez (2007) recognises their applicability to any destination in the event of a crisis. As a result the framework developed by Faulkner (2001) has been extensively employed, with and without amendment in many differing situations (e.g., Henderson, 2003; Miller & Ritchie, 2003; Peters & Pikkemaat, 2005; Novelli, Burgess, Jones & Ritchie, 2018).",
