Phlegm-dampness blocking meridian (Jing-Luo), which further induces Qi stagnation and blood (Xue) stasis, is believed to be the pathological basis of corticosteroid-associated ONFH [22]. The phlegm-dampness pathogen affects mainly the lower part of the body. The hip (femoral head) is among the most susceptible joints to the phlegm-dampness pathogen. Once the phlegm-dampness pathogen affects the femoral head, the circulation of \u201cQi\u201d and \u201cBlood\u201d along the meridian around the hip is to be disturbed. When the meridian branches passing through the femoral head can be blocked, the femoral head is to lose the nutrition of \u201cQi\u201d and \u201cBlood\u201d.",

Every patient was invited to complete a questionnaire designed largely based on the Harris hip score (HHS; Table 3\n) [23], COS for ONFH walking function index [24]. The overall HHS can be divided into pain index and physical function index. The HHS pain index classified the severity of pain by six grades, and the HHS physical function index majorly includes measures of the ability of daily living (ADL; Table 3). Three orthopaedic surgeons who specialised in hip arthritis and were not involved in the present study were invited to evaluate the images. Each decision was made by consensus among the three surgeons. The collapse of the femoral head was defined as a fine radiolucent subchondral fracture line or a depression of articular surface. The degree of hip osteoarthritis was measured according to the Kellgren\u2013Lawrence (K\u2013L) classification [25].",

In the present study, we observed 14 new collapse cases (26.41%) in 53 patients with precollapse ONFH. According to a systematic review published in 2010, which studied the natural history of 598 hips with ONFH, the overall collapse rate was 49.00% after a mean follow-up duration of 4 years [27]. In 2019, Wei et al. [10] reported a collapse rate of 22.00% in 59 patients receiving oral administration of Huo Xue Tong Luo Capsule (a Chinese medication) after a mean follow-up duration of 4.38 years. Our results consistently support Wei's finding that Chinese medicine helps prevent progression to femoral head collapse and avoid THA with prolonged follow-up data.",

HHS is an outcome measure frequently used for evaluation of the physical function among patients with hip joint disorders [28,29]. We observed a mean HHS of 63.89 \u200b\u00b1 \u200b10.30 in 28 patients without THA at the end of the present study. Although the data suggest that HGF therapy only yields poor results (HHS < 70), but our data are still comparable to previous relevant studies [[30], [31], [32], [33]]. Alendronate is one of the most commonly used pharmacological treatments for ONFH [34]. In 2005, an RCT study included 20 patients who received 25-week alendronate treatment, reported a mean HHS of 74.4 \u200b\u00b1 \u200b7.8 after a follow-up duration of 2 years [32]. However, the efficacy of alendronate for treating ONFH has been questioned by later studies [35,36]. Core decompression is believed to be the most reliable operative treatment for precollapse ONFH [37]. Even so, an RCT study published in 2017 reported a mean HHS of 68 \u200b\u00b1 \u200b5 in 21 patients who had undergone core decompression surgery at 3 years follow-up visit [33].",

Although we observed high morbidity of osteoarthritis in the studied cohort, the severity of pain was not proportional to the severity of osteoarthritis. We recorded four patients without hip osteoarthritis complained of moderate groin pain, and two patients with doubtful hip osteoarthritis complained of intense groin pain. Because chronic pain is a complex of subjective sensory and emotional experience, and psychobehavioural problems are not uncommon among these special patients [38], we daringly hypothesise this inexplicable groin pain can somewhat be ascribed to chronic pain sensitisation or depression.",

A similar study reported combined vasoactive pharmacotherapy could successfully prevent collapse, but their 14-year study only included four SARS patients [39]. On the other hand, few randomised clinical trials concerning ONFH can be followed up for a long term. Published studies mostly reported their results after a follow-up duration of only 2 or 3 years [4,33,40], but the previous study had reported that the interval between diagnosis and collapse could be over 4 years in 46% of cases [41]. In comparison to the natural collapse rate of 49% reported by a systematic review that included the most hips with ONFH [27], our study observed a collapse rate of 26% based on prolonged follow-up data, supporting that HGF helps prevent the natural disease progression of ONFH.",
