We designed a DNA microarray comprising 60-bp probes spotted 194 times for the multiplex detection of 33 enteropathogenic bacteria and seven enteropathogenic viruses, and the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii was used as an internal positive control. Nine pathogen-free stool specimens were used as negative controls. One of these control specimens was further spiked with Salmonella enterica as a positive control. The microarray was then tested with 40 pathological stool specimens, comprising S. enterica (n = 30), Campylobacter jejuni (n = 4), pathogenic Escherichia coli (n = 2), and adenovirus (n = 4). M. smithii was detected in 47/49 (95.9%) specimens, no pathogen was detected in negative controls and S. enterica was identified in the S. enterica-spiked positive control. The overall specificity was 100% and the overall sensitivity was 97.5% because one S. enterica sample was missed by the microarray. The multiplexed detection of C. jejuni spiked into an adenovirus-positive stool sample gave positive results, with fluorescence values of 14.3 and 9.1, respectively. These data indicate that using the protocol developed in this article, the DNA array allows for the multiplexed detection of some enteropathogens in stool samples.",

In addition, such an approach would allow for the detection of clusters and epidemics. A DNA microarray is such a technology for the rapid multiplexed detection of microorganisms in clinical specimens (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Accordingly, DNA microarrays have been used to investigate stool microbiota (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) .

The control of carriage Staphylococcus aureus in stool is mandatory for some workers in hospital under French law. These stools were used as 'healthy individuals' without diarrhea. One of these control specimens was spiked with 10 8 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL (final concentration) Salmonella enterica CIP 60.62 serotype Typhimurium (Collection de l'Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and used as a positive control. Human diarrheal stool specimens routinely submitted to the M editerran ee Infection clinical microbiology laboratory, Marseille, containing S. enterica (n = 30), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (n = 1), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (n = 1), Campylobacter jejuni (n = 4), and adenoviruses (n = 4) were collected. Bacteria were routinely detected by culture methods, as previously described (2) . Caliciviruses and enteroviruses were routinely detected by a specific real-time PCR method using previously described primers (25, 26) . Rotaviruses were detected by an immunochromatographic assay (Standard Diagnostics, Gurgaon Haryana, India). All of the viruses were further detected by electron microscopy observation. Among these 40 diarrheal stools, no stool specimen was co-infected.

According to this law, patients were informed that stool specimens could be used for anonymized studies.

To choose the 40 pathogens present on our DNA microarray, we based on a recent review of infectious diarrhea (2) . DNA probes were designed on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence for 15 bacterial enteropathogens and specific gene sequences for an additional 13 bacterial enteropathogens as well as for viruses spotted on our microarray (Tables 1 and 2). Among these pathogens, we designed one specific probe for the detection of Grimontia hollisae that is responsible of human diarrhea for people who consumed raw shellfish, especially oysters or more rarely raw or undercooked fish (27) , and Klebsiella oxytoca that is responsible of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC) especially in children (28) . There are unpublished internal evidences of the association between Planctomycetes and the intestinal microbiota (Drancourt M, 2012, unpublished data) , that is why we designed specific probes for the detection of Gemmata obscuriglobus, Pirellula staleyi, Planctomyces brasiliensis/maris, Planctomyces limnophilus, and Rhodopirellula baltica. In particular, five probes were spotted for the detection of pathogenic E. coli: for enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), we spotted eae and stx1 gene probes (29) ; for enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), we spotted ipaB and ipaD gene probes (30) ; for enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), we spotted the eae gene probe (31) ; and for Shiga toxinproducing E. coli (STEC), we spotted stx1 and stx2 genes probes (32) . The DNA microarray (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France) comprised eight hybridization arrays containing 15 744 features, each consisting of two interlaced rectangular grids of 96 rows at 0.073323-millimeter spacing by 82 columns at 0.127-millimeter spacing. Each 60-mer probe had an approximately 80\u00b0C hybridization temperature. Each probe was spotted 194 times on each hybridization array.",

EIEC strains were detected with ipaB and ipaD probes (30) . IpaB is a gene encoding an invasion protein found in not only E. coli strains but also Shigella and Salmonella strains. This gene is known to be specific for these strains (38) , but we found that our ipaB probe gave positive results for 13/47 (27.7%) stool samples tested. This result may be due to a lack of specificity of the probe despite our favorable in silico analysis. Alternatively, this observation could be explained by the fact that this gene is much more ubiquitous than previously reported. For example, only 6% of genes are common between all E. coli strains, which are called the core genome (39) , and in fact, we do not really know the virulence genes that can reliably identify strains of E. coli.",

Further studies will aim to reduce the turn-over time, which was 3 h in this study. The DNA microarray technique is amenable to automation and could be used for epidemiological studies and the selection of stool specimens devoid of any known pathogen for further investigations using additional approaches. The cost of DNA microarray remains a negative point as this technique in our laboratory is estimated at about 130 \u20ac per sample. In addition, a more complete version of the DNA microarray could be used for the repertoire of the gut microbiota using the protocol developed in this study.",

Real-time PCR conditions included 2 min of UDG decontamination at 50\u00b0C and 10 min of denaturation at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 s at 95\u00b0C, 35 s at 60\u00b0C and 45 s at 72\u00b0C. Each specific real-time PCR assay included a positive and a negative control. The cut-off for positivity was established at 38 cycle threshold (Ct). All the specimens were tested in duplicate. The extraction of C. jejuni was validated by classical PCR using two specific pairs of primers. The first pair targeted the fla gene(34), and the second one targeted the wlaC gene(35). These primer pairs were designed in our laboratory and generated 3 390-and 600-bp fragments, respectively. Each PCR was performed in a 25-lL mixture containing 2.5 lL of 10 9 buffer (Qiagen), 0.5 lL of each primer, 2.5 lL of deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France), one unit of Hot Start (Qiagen), 10.8 lL water and 5 lL DNA. PCR was performed under the following conditions: a 5-min denaturation at 95\u00b0C; 40 cycles of 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 2 min at 60\u00b0C and 1 min at 72\u00b0C; and a final extension step of 5 min at 72\u00b0C for the fla gene; and denaturation for 5 min at 95\u00b0C; 40 cycles of 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 55\u00b0C, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C; and a final extension step of 5 min at 72\u00b0C for the wlaC gene.",

This step was repeated once. A total of 25 lL of proteinase K (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and 180 lL of lysis buffer provided by the Nucleospin Tissue kit (Macherey Nagel, Hoerdt, France) were added before overnight incubation at 56\u00b0C. Next, 100 lL total DNA was extracted from 200 lL specimen using the EZ1 DNA Tissue kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Extracted DNA was further purified using a phenol-chloroform protocol(33). Each extracted specimen was analyzed with a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA) to evaluate DNA amounts.
