            "text": "Respiratory infections and gastroenteritis constitute the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, both in developing and developed countries [1]. Despite the widespread adoption of vaccines strategies, some pathogens remain a threat to public health worldwide. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD, USA) declared the emergence of 16 new infectious diseases, six of which have been considered reemerging infections [2]. In the United States of America (USA), mortality caused by infectious diseases (IDs) was amounted to 170,000 deaths in 2000 [3]. An increase in immunocompromised patients plays a crucial role in the emergence and/or reemergence of IDs; therefore, post-infection complications can lead to death. Public health is faced with two major obstacles to eradicating IDs: (1) Antibiotic therapies, which have been saving infected patient for several years. Unfortunately, the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is occurring worldwide, endangering the efficacy of antibiotics, which have transformed medicine and saved millions of lives [4]. (2) The lack of antiviral agents against infectious viruses, which leads to a high treatment level between populations even in the presence of some vaccines covering a few virus types [5]. Several strategies have been developed to overcome this crisis, e.g., (i) the use of bacteriophages as antibacterial agents [4], (ii) the extraction and purification of antimicrobial peptides [6], and (iii) the prevention of IDs by using vaccines and/or recombinant vaccine strategies [7]. Preventing infectious diseases occurring seems to be the perfect method of avoiding ID complications, since all of the abovementioned strategies have inconveniences such as side effects and stability in the host.",

In the adult and elderly groups, the administration of L. casei DN-114,001 decreased the duration of RTIs and common infectious diseases (CIDs) [38\u201340, 67].",

These strains showed a strong anti-IFV activity, in particular against the H1N1 strain. The anti-H1N1 activity of L. brevis KB-290 was reported to increase IFN-\u03b1 and IgA secretion in mouse lungs after oral administration of this strain [50]. The oral administration of L. gasseri TMC0356 in intranasally H1N1-infected mice showed a positive effect on influenza symptoms. L. gasseri TMC0356 can decrease the viral titers by interacting with the intestinal immunity system, in particular in Peyer\u2019s patch, resulting in high production of IL-12, IL-6, IFN-c, and IgA [27]. Kiso et al. reported that the oral administration of L. pentosus b240 increased protection in mice against a lethal dose of H1N1. The primary mechanism of this effect was by upregulation of antiviral genes such as Egr1 (a critical regulator of host inflammatory chemokines) and Rsad2 (an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)) [52]. Izumo et al. reported a new antiviral activity mechanism in a mouse experimental model infected by the H1N1 strain. They showed that the antiviral activity was created by activation of lung NK cells after intranasal administration of L. pentosus S-PT84 in BALB/c mice. Moreover, this strain can increase the production of IFN-\u03b1 and IgA and decrease the allergic reaction by modulating the Th1/Th2 balance [51].",

The alleviation of symptoms was measured in these CTs in order to investigate the impact of suggested probiotic strains against RVs. The main mechanism of such probiotics is immunomodulation. The use of probiotics in respiratory infections leads to the activation of many signals for innate immunity and the production of IgA antibodies in respiratory tissue. Anti-inflammatory probiotics in respiratory viral infections are not welcome, since they block the immune responses against the virus. However, in respiratory inflammation, probiotics that stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory (IL-10, TGF\u03b2) cytokines play a crucial role in suppressing inflammation.",

The LPS-bound virus increases the thermostability and chlorine resistance as well as decreasing the viral genome release [105]. Moreover, the pretreatment of poliovirus particles with Gram-negative bacteria/or LPS molecules promotes poliovirus attachment to the host cells [105]. The poliovirus receptor (PVR) seems to be an important element in the abovementioned host cell attachment. The authors showed that poliovirus cannot attach to the permissive cells which were pretreated with anti-PVR antibodies. This result was independent of the presence of LPS binding to poliovirus. Moreover, non-PVR-expressing cells also showed the same results [105]. Using another viral model and after a long history of in vitro culture difficulties, B cells seem to be permissive cells for MuNoV [103].",

The authors showed that LPS molecules were not the bacterial compound that played the cofactor role in norovirus infection.

Moreover, the authors showed that the histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) glycan was a cofactor of the norovirus infection [106].

Briefly, the capacity of enteric viruses to bind Gram-negative bacteria by LPS-VP (viral protein) binding can skew the immune response. The story begins when the enteric virus binds the microbiota LPS. The LPS will be recognized by the TLR4, which induces the production of IL-6. The B cells have IL-6R; when the IL-6 binds to the IL-6R of the B cells, the B cells produce IL-10, which is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This action blocks the antiviral immunity response and leads to viral persistence. This information is supported by several studies using an MMTV and norovirus model in solenocyte and B-cell culturing, respectively [99, 111, 112]. In another study, the norovirus infection occurred in germ-free mice which were also deficient in production of IL-10. This study supports and confirms that the production of IL-10 by the presence of gut microbiota, in particular Gram-negative bacteria, was the essential key to viral persistence through the creation of a tolerogenic microenvironment [113, 114].(ii)\nViral antibody production\n\n",

These findings will be investigated in depth to identify exactly which bacterial compound is responsible for this mechanism and to determine if this interaction occurred in a virus-strain-specific manner.",

Briefly, EnVs are recognized by a variety of TLRs, such as TLR3, TLR9, etc. These TLRs stimulate the IFN production by the B cells or other secretory cells. The IFNs, in particular type III IFN\u03b3, bind to the IFN receptor present on the enterocytes, which can reduce the viral persistence. Several studies have reported that commensal bacteria, in particular Gram-negative bacteria recognized by TLR4, bind to the EnVs and then the immune system will be skewed. Thus, the TLR4s inhibit the production of IFN\u03b3, allowing viral persistence. This data was confirmed using MuNoVs as an EnV model [102, 116\u2013118]. Pott et al. reported that IFN\u03b3 also controls rotavirus infection in mice; thus, it will be interesting to determine whether this response is similarly regulated by the interactions between the enteric virus and commensal bacteria [119].",

Another study showed that LGG strains and L. casei Shirota (LcS) have an antiviral activity against rotaviruses and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The LGG strain showed the strongest activity, because of their strongest attachment capability to different cell lines. In addition to the attachment effect, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) release seems to play a role in such activity [138]. Teran et al. conducted a randomized single-blind controlled trial (RSBCT) in 75 Bolivian children aged from 28 days to 24 months. A 1-gram mix of probiotic strains was administered to the probiotic group (n =25) for 5 days. The mix contained the following strains: L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, B. longum, and Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii). The second group (n =25) was given nitazoxanide (an antiparasitic agent) at the dose of 15 mg/kg. The third group (n =25) was subjected to the normal protocol of rehydration. The results showed that the duration of diarrhea was reduced to 48 h compared with 54 h and 79 h for the nitazoxanide and rehydration groups, respectively [162]. Moreover, a study conducted by Grandy et al. in RDBPC trial showed the effectiveness of probiotic strains against rotavirus infections using S. boulardii alone and S. boulardii with a mixture of probiotic strains. The results showed that the two probiotic preparations reduced the infection symptoms (p = 0.0042) [122]. L. reuteri, called Probio-16, showed antiviral activity against porcine rotavirus; this activity was poorly demonstrated [139].",

The probiotics with antiviral activity were evaluated in vivo using a mouse model in most studies. Hagbom et al. confirmed that the neonatal mice and rats provide a reliable animal model for studying the rotavirus infection and also immune responses during this infection [142]. In a murine infected model, LGG has decreased both the barrier permeability in murine intestine and epithelium vacuolation in the jejunum. Furthermore, LGG was able to reduce the duration of acute diarrhea, and finally LGG was able to stimulate the secretion of IgA [143, 144]. L. casei DN-114,001 was administered in germ-free suckling rats infected further by rotavirus. The results showed that L. casei DN-114,001 changed the morphology of the intestinal villi and decreased intestinal cell lesions [145].

NoVs cause 267 million infections each year and over 200,000 deaths, mostly in infants and the elderly [171, 172]. NoVs need host receptors to start the infection cycle. Debbink et al. reported that HBGA (See sec.

The expression of HBGAs depend on the fut2 gene which codes for an enzyme called fucosyltransferase. The GI.1 genotype (Norwalk virus) cannot infect patients with a nonfunctional fut2 gene (called a \u201cnonsecretory host\u201d). However, some NoV strains are capable of binding other receptors such as Lewis carbohydrates [173, 174].",

Furthermore, L. rhamnosus, L. casei BL23 CECT5275, L. casei VSL#3 showed the highest binding effect of both p-particles. As unexpected results, the E. coli Nissle 1917 \u2013 Gram-negative probiotic \u2013 showed the poorest binding capacity to GI.1 and GII.4, although other studies showed that Gram-negative bacteria can bind enteroviruses via LPS molecules or HBGAs [97, 107]. In contrast, in HT-29 culture cells, E. coli Nissle 1917 was more efficient in NoV p-particles blocking, resulting in low host cell binding, while the other probiotic strains showed a low inhibition effect. The low adhesion capacity of probiotic strains to host cells did not affect p-particles binding; this suggestion was confirmed by the L. plantarum 299v adh- (probiotic strain with low attachment capacity) which showed high GI.1 p-particles binding compared with L. plantarum 99v (normal attachment capacity). In order to investigate the interaction between probiotic strains and NoV p-particles in more depth, an exclusion assay (HT-29 cells incubated with bacteria followed by P-particles challenge) and displacement test (HT-29 cells incubated with p-particles followed by bacterial challenge) were performed. The results showed that the probiotic strains enhanced the NoV p-particle attachment of monolayer surfaces. These results are not clear, since they disagree with other studies. The probable hypothesis is that the attached probiotic strains can bind to the NoV p-particles on their peptidoglycans (teichoic acid), which can lead to higher p-particle retention on the HT-29 surfaces [157].",

Astroviruses can infect a wide variety of mammalian species, such as cats [179], dogs [180], mice [181], sheep [182], and cattle [183]. These mammals are always in direct contact with humans. HAstVs are one of the most important causes of acute gastroenteritis in newborn and infant patients [184]. Cross-species transmission is frequent, in particular in poultry as avian species [185] and between pigs, cats, and humans as mammalian species [186]. Thus, the zoonotic potential of these viruses is high, and future nonhuman-to-human transmissions are likely to occur [178].

Since CA16 and EV71 act by the orofecal route, Ang Yin et al. evaluated the impact of colonization of the probiotic strain on HFMD using in vitro human skeletal muscle and colon cell lines. The authors showed that the use of L. reuteri Protectis (ATCC 55730) [195], decreased the viral load. Moreover, this antiviral activity is dose-dependent. The authors suggested that L. reuteri Protectis interacted physically with CA6, CA16, and EV71 and impaired viral entry to eukaryotic cells. This antiviral activity seems to be virus probiotic strain specific, since no antiviral effect was shown using Coxsackievirus B strain 2 (target virus) in the presence of another probiotic strain LcS [161].",

This figure shows the antiviral mechanisms of some probiotic strains used against viral respiratory infections. Although there is a difference between the probiotic colonization ecosystem and the target RV ecosystem, several studies have showed that there is a relationship between gut microbiota and other tissues. Probiotics can inhibit viruses and/or help the immune system defend itself against RVs. First, the RVs interact with the respiratory epithelium, which generates an innate immune response by activating the IFN signaling and other proinflammatory cytokines. Once cytokines have been secreted, macrophages and NK cells will be recruited to phagocytize and kill both viruses and viral-infected cells. To trigger a specific immune response, the immune system needs proinflammatory cytokines, energy, and some cofactor elements. Hence, probiotics can provide some elements to boost the immune response: A. Probiotics interact with the gut epithelium and are recognized by intestinal DCs (IDCs); this interaction results in the production of IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 by IDCs, which can modulate both the respiratory and gut immune response. B\n. Secretion of IFN\u03b3 and IL-12 by intestinal DCs; these two proinflammatory cytokines have dual functions: IFN\u03b3 and IL-12 can circulate in the bloodstream to reach the respiratory epithelium and therefore help alveolar macrophages and NK cells eliminate RVs. C. The proinflammatory cytokines (IFN\u03b3 and IL-12) secreted in the gut ecosystem after colonization of some probiotic strains help the immune system to generate a specific Th1/Th17 immune response; the number of CD4+ and CD8+ increases and becomes more efficient. In addition, CD4+ will secrete IL-17, which enhances the innate immune response. D. Some probiotic strains, via induction of IFN\u03b3 and IL-17 production, can stimulate the overexpression of innate immunity-related genes such as the overexpression of TLR7, even in the lung. This overexpression of TLR7 amplifies the innate immune responses. E. Probiotics can help B lymphocytes differentiate and become plasma cells, which can secrete specific sIgA. In our case, some studies showed the impact of some probiotics in increasing sIgA in lung tissues. However, until now there is no explanation of the real mechanisms of how intestinal probiotics can help secretion of sIgA which are specific to elimination of RVs. This effect can be explained by the capacity of some probiotics to enhance cytokine production, which can improve the rapid differentiation of B lymphocytes to plasma cells in lung tissues.",

            "text": "Fig. 1.3: Suggested mechanisms of antiviral probiotics against enteric viruses. Since probiotics and EnVs have the same route of entry, probiotics can interact with viral particles in several ways. The advantage here is the capacity of probiotics to colonize the gut ecosystem, which is the target of EnVs: A. Some probiotic strains can colonize the gut ecosystem and then form a carbohydrate biofilm which probably saturates host IEC receptors as well as viral receptors. B. Probiotics protect the host IECs against damage and lesions. Several studies have confirmed that some probiotic strains play a crucial role in tissue restoration, especially by inducing mucin secretion by IECs and strengthening cell tight junctions. C. The immunomodulatory effect is the principal mechanism of antiviral probiotics (AvPr). These probiotics can stimulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, especially from DCs such as IL-6, Il-12, and IFN\u03b3. In addition, AvPr can boost innate immune cells, such as macrophages and NK cells. The latter also produce IFN-\u03b1, which is an antiviral cytokine. D. AvPr help the immune system to react with more rapid specific responses. The Th2 response is essential for B lymphocytes to be able to differentiate into plasma cells with specific sIgA secretion. E. AvPr can inhibit or decrease viral infectivity and spreading by superproduction of mucin and by changing the morphology of villi, which can skew viral attachment. F. TLR3 is the PPR of viral MAMPs, especially for RNA viruses. Hence, the overexpression of TLR3 induced by some AvPr can amplify the innate immune response by catching a large number of viral particles. G. Some AvPr interact physically with viral particles. Indeed, several studies have showed that some probiotic strains can bind or trap viral particles on their cell wall. Moreover, these trapped viruses lose some pathogenic characteristics and consequently lose cell infectivity. H. Finally, AvPr can play an indirect role in preventing and/or decreasing viral infection, especially against enteric viruses, by excluding the colonization of Gram-negative bacteria (See Fig. 1.3).",

AvPr can play an indirect role in preventing and/or decreasing viral infection, especially against enteric viruses, by excluding the colonization of Gram-negative bacteria (see Fig. 1.3) in the gut ecosystem, which were considered a cofactor in some enteric virus infections. Thus, proinflammatory probiotics (which induce a proinflammatory response) are welcome in viral gastroenteritis because they can trigger proinflammatory immunity to eliminate EnVs. Probiotic strains capable of binding host cells very well and then creating a microenvironment which prevents many kinds of commensal and pathogenic bacteria from proliferating, including Gram-negative bacteria. Probiotics have a stronger capacity to adhere to host cells than Gram-negative bacteria (probably because of the high hydrophobicity of their cell walls), which can decrease the number of Gram-negative bacteria. Probiotics can act in different ways: A. Biofilm formation: This biofilm can protect host cells against other commensal bacteria, because this biofilm covers the majority of host cell receptors. B. By the immunomodulatory effect, probiotics can stimulate the innate immune response, especially of phagocytes. C. At the same time, probiotics induce the secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as \u03b2-defensins and cathelicidins which target commensal bacteria. However, there is no explanation of the resistance of some probiotic strains against these AMPs. D. Overproduction of mucin can also prevent commensal bacteria adhesion. E. The co-aggregation capacity of probiotic strains leads to the trapping of other microbes, as well as commensal or Gram-negative bacteria. F. Probiotics can secrete several enzymes to compete with other commensal bacteria for nutrients present in the gut ecosystem. In addition, the majority of probiotic strains possess arginine dehydrogenase, which is important in this mechanism. G. Probiotic strains can secrete a variety of antimicrobial substances, such as hydrogen peroxide, lactic acid, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), bacteriocins, and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS).",
