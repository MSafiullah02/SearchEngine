In March 2009, infections caused by a new swine\u2010origin influenza A/H1N1 virus were diagnosed in Mexico and the United States (4). In June 2009, the World Health Organization declared influenza pandemic. Autopsy and epidemiological studies showed some differences between seasonal and pandemic influenza infections (19). Age at the death was younger than in the seasonal form, as in our case (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Immunologic protection induced by prior exposure to previously circulating A/H1N1 viruses (5) is likely to explain this age difference. Up to 91% of the patients had preexisting medical conditions, including cardiac or respiratory diseases, immunosuppression, pregnancy, and obesity. The latter was an unexpected finding as compared to prior pandemics (5).",

She was found dead in her living room with the television on, which suggested a sudden arrhythmic death. Nonetheless, pneumonia was assessed as the cause of the death, because of histological findings. The heart was both macroscopically and histologically normal, but only oral cavity and upper respiratory tract swabs for the influenza virus were performed for virology. The possible presence of the virus in the heart and its proarrhythmogenic role was not investigated. Yet, some studies have shown that cardiotropic viruses may cause acute/fulminant myocarditis without inflammatory cells (21, 22, 23, 24). Influenza A/H1N1 (2009)\u2010related myocarditis was assessed as the cause of two reported unexpected out\u2010of\u2010hospital deaths (2, 6). In one case, there was no evidence of pneumonia, whereas in the other, the child patient had both pneumonia and myocarditis. Histological myocardial inflammation was present in both cases. In both cases, influenza A/H1N1 (2009) virus was found by PCR in the heart. However, in one case, no other cardiotropic viruses were sought in the heart to rule out the involvement of such viruses. In the other, cardiotropic viruses were sought in paraffin\u2010embedded cardiac tissue. It has been shown that virological analyses should be performed on frozen tissue, because of false\u2010negative results when paraffin\u2010embedded tissues are used (15).

Alveolar hemorrhages in patients with comorbidities and/or acute bacterial bronchopneumonia were also frequent findings associated with the influenza A/H1N1 (2009) virus (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11). Acute necrotizing tracheobronchitis and/or bronchiolitis, sometimes associated with hemorrhage is a frequent finding (4, 5, 7, 8, 9). These patterns are not specific of influenza A/H1N1 (2009) infection, being also found in the seasonal influenza\u2010related deaths (19). In our case, the microscopic lung findings were unusual. No diffuse alveolar damage, but rounded patchy foci of necrosis associated with inflammatory cells were found. These cells were mostly lymphocytes and mononuclear macrophages, associated with some multinucleated (two to three nuclei) macrophages. Neutrophils were very rare. In the trachea and bronchi, only mild and focal inflammation was present. Not surprisingly, the person had no respiratory symptoms. Influenza A/H1N1 (2009) virus was the only cause of pulmonary lesions in this person, because thorough microbiological investigations were performed on frozen lung tissue.",

In the published cases, acute myocarditis was characterized by necrosis and inflammation, associated with the detection of influenza A/H1N1 (2009) by PCR (2, 6). The possible presence of other cardiotropic viruses in the heart was not investigated. Furthermore, some studies have shown that cardiotropic viruses may cause acute/fulminant myocarditis without inflammatory cells (21, 22, 23, 24). In our case, we did not find myocardial inflammation despite many samples in both ventricles (n = 15). According to Dallas criteria used for endomyocardial biopsy examination, myocarditis has been defined as inflammation associated with necrosis (25). It is now recognized that the Dallas criteria are not sensitive for the diagnosis of myocarditis, because they do not take into account the presence of viral genome in the heart (19, 26). Investigators have shown that virus may be present in the myocardium without Dallas myocarditis criteria. Martin et al. (21) demonstrated in 34 children with clinical presentations compatible with myocarditis that 26 heart biopsy samples were positive for viral pathogens, and 13 of the 26 positive samples had no evidence of myocarditis by histopathological examination. A meta\u2010analysis of PCR studies in patients who had heart biopsies with presumed myocarditis or cardiomyopathy demonstrated an odds ratio of 3.8 for viral presence in both categories compared with control patients (22). In a selected sample of 45 patients with left ventricular dysfunction and suspected myocarditis and 26 controls, nonreplicative enterovirus was demonstrated in 18 of 45 patients (40%) compared with none of the controls. Of the 18 patients with nonreplicative virus, 10 (56%) were found to have active viral replication as well (23). Therefore, virus can exist in the myocardium in the absence of myocardial inflammation adequate to meet Dallas criteria and may adversely affect outcome (19). In these cases, as in ours, death may have occurred before inflammation developed. The fulminant course in our case suggests high virus virulence and/or non\u2010cell\u2010mediated inflammation. As far as virus virulence is concerned, our genetic investigations did not reveal gene mutations involving hemaglutinin and neuraminidase. However, the patient had not received vaccination.",

Our cardiac findings support this hypothesis. In fulminant forms of the disease, this cytokine storm might explain cardiotoxicity and proarrhythmogenic effects of the virus, before or despite inflammatory cell\u2010mediated involvement.",

In our case, influenza A/H1N1 (2009) virus was detected in pharyngeal swabs, frozen lungs, and heart samples. Viral load quantification showed high levels of viral genome copies per microgram of extracted DNA in the different collected samples. In only one other study, viral load was quantified in paraffin\u2010embedded lung, bronchus, and tracheal tissues (12). The number of viral influenza A/H1N1 (2009) copies was 2.37 \u00d7 105, but the site where this load was assessed was not specified (12). Furthermore, extraction of good\u2010quality DNA and RNA from formalin\u2010fixed, paraffin\u2010embedded (FFPE) tissues is compromised because of incomplete removal of protein\u2013nucleic acid cross\u2010links (27). Other authors performed real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR on nonrespiratory FFPE tissue and failed to detect influenza A/H1N1 (2009) (8). Impaired nucleic acid can lead to false\u2010negative result. It has been shown that quantification of viral load in different tissues provides information on the virus spreading pattern (28). In one study, a high number of viral copies per cell in the trachea, compared with a small number in the lower lung samples, suggested a gradient of viral replication throughout the respiratory tract (12). In our case, a higher viral load in the upper respiratory airways than in the lung was also found.",

Forensic pathologists have played an important role in improving the knowledge of the different patterns. In most cases, the heart is grossly normal. Histology requires many samples in both ventricles because of the patchy inflammatory pattern (19, 29, 30, 31). More recently, molecular biology has shown the importance of virological analyses performed on frozen tissue, including quantification of viral load (15, 19, 20, 26). In our case, determination of viral loads in the absence of any inflammatory infiltrate in the myocardium has shown that influenza A/H1N1 (2009) virus can be a cause of out\u2010of\u2010hospital unexpected death in the young. Because symptoms are sometimes unspecific and mild, influenza A/H1N1 (2009)\u2010related deaths may be misdiagnosed, which can raise medico\u2010legal issues.
