The main virulence factor of Xanthomonas is the Hrp2 family T3SS; however, this system is not conserved in all strains and it has not been previously determined whether the distribution of T3SS in this bacterial genus has resulted from losses or independent acquisitions. Based on comparative genomics of 82 genome sequences representing the diversity of the genus, we have inferred three ancestral acquisitions of the Hrp2 cluster during Xanthomonas evolution followed by subsequent losses in some commensal strains and re-acquisition in some species. While mutation was the main force driving polymorphism at the gene level, interspecies homologous recombination of large fragments expanding through several genes shaped Hrp2 cluster polymorphism. Horizontal gene transfer of the entire Hrp2 cluster also occurred. A reduced core effectome composed of xopF1, xopM, avrBs2 and xopR was identified that may allow commensal strains overcoming plant basal immunity.",

In pathogenic interactions, T3SS may enable the development of disease (via neutralization of plant defences and manipulation of host cellular processes) or trigger host resistance (through recognition inducing hypersensitive response). The T3SS is also widespread in mutualistic and commensal bacteria of protist, fungal and animal hosts (Abby & Rocha, 2012) . As the T3SS and T3Es play a crucial role in prokaryote-eukaryote interactions, knowledge of their origin and evolution is likely to be crucial to deepen our understanding of host adaptation.",

Further T3SS diversification then lead to seven distinct families of T3SSs (Ysc, SPI-1, SPI-2, Chlamy, Hrp1, Hrp2 and Rhizo) (Troisfontaines & Cornelis, 2005) . Diversification of the T3SS is not explained simply by vertical evolution.

            "text": "Extensive diversification of the T3SS seems to be driven by bacteria ecology, as T3SS families correlate with the host type. Indeed, Rhizo, Hrp1 and Hrp2 seem to be more frequently involved in interactions with plants, whereas Ysc, Chlamy, SPI-1 and SPI-2 appear to be specific to interactions with mammals, insects and amoeba (Abby & Rocha, 2012; Diepold & Armitage, 2015; Troisfontaines & Cornelis, 2005) . In general, each bacterial genus harbours a T3SS from a specific family but some bacteria with complex lifestyles harbour several T3SS from different families. These contrasting patterns of T3SS content could be explained by ancient vertical inheritance mixed with T3SS gain and loss events (Kirzinger, Butz, & Stavrinides, 2015) . The main T3SS families found in phytopathogens are Hrp1 (in Pseudomonas and Erwinia) and Hrp2 (in Xanthomonas, Ralstonia, Acidovorax and Burkholderia); however, alternative noncanonical T3SS has also been described in some plant-associated bacteria such as commensal pseudomonads associated with plants ( Barret et al., 2013) . These two main families of T3SS clusters, Hrp1 and Hrp2, differ in gene content, synteny and transcriptional regulation. Approximately 20 protein-coding genes, called hrp (hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity) and hpa (hrp-associated) genes, are involved in the biogenesis of T3SS. Among them, nine genes, which were renamed hrc (hrp conserved), are highly conserved in plant and animal pathogens, and eight have homologs in the flagellar cluster (Tampakaki et al., 2010) . T3E repertoires are highly diverse within each genus and even within single bacterial species (McCann & Guttman, 2008) . They vary both in terms of content and size, for instance a given Xanthomonas axonopodis strain may have any between six and 26 T3E genes (Hajri et al., 2009) . It has been suggested that this high variability could be the consequence of the host adaptation process. Indeed, in Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas, the pathogenic strains are highly host specific and the T3E repertoire composition is correlated with host range (Hajri et al., 2009; Sarkar, Gordon, Martin, & Guttman, 2006) .",

Are pathogenicity and Hrp2 clusters ancestral features of Xanthomonas that have been vertically inherited and lost in some species or do they represent more recent acquisitions? Contrasting with our deep knowledge of ancient evolutionary history of T3SS, little is known about recent origin and evolution of T3SS and its role in plant pathogen emergence. Given the pivotal role of T3SS and T3Es in xanthomonads pathogenicity and host specificity, and given their heterogeneous distribution at genus and species scales, the Hrp2 cluster and its effectors in Xanthomonas genus appear to be a good model to study T3SS origin and evolution at a fine evolutionary scale. In this study, we conducted our analyses on a collection of strains representing all valid species from the two phylogenetic groups of the genus (groups 1 and 2) as defined by Young, Park, Shearman, and Fargier (2008) . We inferred their phylogenetic relatedness based on the core genome of the whole genus. Moreover, to get insights into T3SS evolution, we studied not only cluster synteny, hrc gene phylogeny and homologous recombination, but we also considered the genomic environment of the T3SS cluster.",

Eight of the 14 strains lacking the T3SS cluster were also deprived of T3E-coding genes. In contrast, between one and two T3E genes (avrBs2 and xopR) were identified in the remaining six strains (Data S3). While synteny in the xopR genomic environments has previously been shown (Merda et al., 2016) , here we observed that genomic environments of avrBs2 were also highly syntenic between all strains, with the exception of strains CFBP 7408 and CFBP 7409 (Fig. S4) , favouring an ancestral acquisition and subsequent losses of these T3Es during X. arboricola evolution. The two strains of pathovar guizotiae, CFBP 7408 and CFBP 7409, probably lost and reacquired avrBs2. It has to be noted that avrBs2 was systematically accompanied by three CDSs, namely xylR, a TonB-dependent receptor and a hypothetical protein that presented the same distribution in our collection whatever the genomic context (see Fig. S4 ). In addition to xopR and avrBs2, five other T3E genes (already described in Xanthomonas strains) were found in all X. arboricola strains having a T3SS. These five T3E genes were located within the T3SS cluster (Figure 3b ) and their distribution strictly followed the distribution of the T3SS cluster. However, among them were XopA, HpaA and HrpW, which, while listed as T3Es in some studies (Hajri et al., 2009; Merda et al., 2016) , are secreted regulator (HpaA) or hairpin-like proteins and their effector function remains unclear (Lorenz et al., 2008; White et al., 2009) . Synteny in the flanking regions of avrBs2, xopR, and of the five T3E genes associated with the T3SS cluster suggested that they were most probably acquired by an ancient X. arboricola strain; thus, these seven T3E genes will be designated as the ancestral repertoire thereafter.",

The donor and recipient strains were identified with RDP software, and the representation was obtained using Circos. Each strain is represented by a rectangle of a different colour. The recombination events are represented by a link between donor and recipient strains. The colour of the link corresponds to the colour of the donor and indicates the direction of recombination event. The width of the links represents the number of genes involved in the recombination events. For strains belonging to Xanthomonas arboricola a colour code was used to represent the three groups previously defined (Merda et al., 2016) . Group A strains are indicated in red, group B strains in green, and group C strains in blue. (b) Representation of ratios of recombination rate vs. mutation rate (q/h) along the T3SS cluster using 61 genomes representing the genus diversity. Ratios were calculated for the 16 hrc/hrp genes of the core region of T3SS cluster using RDP software. Arrows are shaded according to the shading scale which indicates the range of the q/h value. The black arrows represent hpa and T3E genes for which q/h was not calculated. Genetic organization of the cluster is based on the sequence of CFBP 2528.

The study of \"donor\" and \"recipient\" strains of recombinant fragments showed that X. arboricola strains were the main \"recipient,\" particularly in commensal strains, and Xanthomonas dyei and Xanthomonas hortorum were the two main donors The function of T3SS is to deliver T3Es into host cells. In most strains devoid of T3SSs, no T3E genes could be detected in their genomes using machine-learning approach and BLASTp (data not shown). Indeed, some T3E genes are housed in the T3SS cluster (Figure 3b ) and thus were lost with it. xopR and avrBs2, which are not located in T3SS cluster, were found in the genomes of some commensal Xanthomonas strains lacking T3SS. Their conserved genomic environments, when compared to strains with T3SSs, suggest that they are remnants of an ancestral T3E repertoire (Fig. S4 ) (Merda et al., 2016) . A recent loss of the T3SS could explain why the T3Es were present despite the lack of the T3SS. Alternatively, xopR and avrBs2 secretion might be mediated by the flagellum apparatus as demonstrated for some nonflagellar proteins (Journet, Hughes, & Cornelis, 2005) . They might also have an additional function independent of the T3SS.",

Together, these results challenge the list of ten core T3E genes (avrBs2, xopF1, xopK, xopL, xopN, xopP, xopQ, xopR, xopX, xopZ) previously proposed White et al., 2009) . xopM, missing in this list, was recently shown to be a T3E gene of Xanthomonas euvesicatoria strain 85-10 (Schulze et al., 2012; Teper et al., 2016) . Our BLASTp searches showed that it is present in most group 2 Xanthomonas species (data not shown). Considering that xopR and avrBs2 were missing in only one and two strains, respectively, of 13 Xanthomonas campestris (Roux et al., 2015) , we propose a list of four putative core Xanthomonas T3Es: AvrBs2, XopF1, XopM and XopR. Interestingly, AvrBs2 contributes to bacterial fitness in field conditions, including epiphytic survival (Wichmann & Bergelson, 2004) .

During radiation, most species retained this ancestral T3SS, but some lost it and subsequently it was re-acquired in some strains. Mutation is the main evolutionary force generating new hrc/hrp alleles. In group 2, Xanthomonas, the inter-and intraspecies homologous recombination of large fragments expanding through one or more genes shuffles this polymorphism generating new allelic combinations in Hrp2 clusters. A set of four ancestral core T3E genes is found in commensal strains and pathogens in X. arboricola that may approximate the Xanthomonas ancestral core effectome. We propose that these may allow the strains to overcome basal plant immunity under specific environmental conditions, but could have a fitness cost explaining why they were lost in some strains. In contrast, some strains experienced a different evolutionary pathway with stepwise accumulation of T3Es that probably accounts for their efficacy to overcome plant immunity and could explain the high aggressiveness. X. arboricola represents the archetype of this evolutionary scenario, which seems to share similarities with the one proposed for P. syringae (Lindeberg et al., 2012) and",

Hrp2-negative strains were interspersed in the phylogenetic tree of the genus, a distribution pattern that could be either explained by ancestral acquisition and subsequent losses or by numerous recent independent Hrp2 acquisitions. A comparison of upstream and downstream genomic environments (20 kb on each side) of the T3SS cluster in the different Xanthomonas species allowed us to define similar genomic environments based on synteny and similarities of DNA fragments (Fig. S1). Strains exhibiting similar flanking regions around the T3SS cluster were considered to have vertically inherited a T3SS cluster following a single acquisition event in their common ancestor. This analysis revealed three ancestral acquisitions of this cluster. One of these acquisitions would have occurred in the ancestor of the three group 2 clades (A, B, C). The same genomic environments of Hrp2 clusters were highlighted in strains belonging to clade A and X. bromi (clade B) (Figures 1",

This suggests that commensal strains are found in sympatry with a large number of different Xanthomonas species because genetic material exchanges can only take place when individuals colonize the same niche. X. dyei and X. arboricola strains were isolated from the endemic species Dysoxylum spectabile in New Zealand(Young, Wilkie, Park, & Watson, 2010). These observations reinforce the hypothesis proposed by Merda et al. (2016) that the commensal strains in X. arboricola are generalist organisms colonizing many different plants. In contrast, no gene flow at T3SS locus occurred between clade B strains and other clades. Divergent evolution of the T3SS cluster in this clade may have led to an optimized allelic combination.

Interestingly, all these strains originated from south-east Africa and were isolated from two crops (Niger seed and bean) used in mixed crop-livestock farming systems and as intercrops in maize production(Abera, Feyisa, & Friesen, 2009), making their co-occurrence plausible. Beside this single whole Hrp2 cluster replacement, numerous localized homologous recombination events between strains of different species have perturbed the vertical inheritance signal. Similarly, conflicts between phylogenies of some hrp/hrc genes and of housekeeping genes were observed in pseudomonads and enterobacterial plant pathogens(Sarris et al., 2013;Tegli, Gori, Cerboneschi, Cipriani, & Sisto, 2011) and a HGT event expanding through several hrp genes was previously suggested in pseudomonads",
