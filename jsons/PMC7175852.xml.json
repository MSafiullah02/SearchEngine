COVID-19 has been identified from a family of zoonotic coronaviruses, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) seen in the past decade. The starting point of the virus is considered to be the Wuhan city of China, and the first fatal cases were reported in late 2019. At this point, this virus causes fatal effects, especially on the elderly and those with chronic diseases (Wang et al., 2020).",

The number of confirmed cases varies due to differences in epidemiological surveillance and detection capacities between countries. However, it can be said that the disease has spread all over the world as of today. Since there is no treatment method determined for this type of virus yet, it requires the effective planning of the health infrastructure and services, where the rate of disease spread should be controlled. For this reason, the estimation of the total confirmed cases and possible new cases in the future is vital for managing and directing the demand to the health system. Mathematical and statistical modeling tools that can be used for making short and long-term case estimates to plan the number of additional materials and resources are needed to deal with the outbreak. Estimating the expected burden of disease is essential for public health officials to effectively and timely manage medical care and other resources needed to overcome the epidemic. Also, such estimates can direct the intensity and type of interventions needed to alleviate the outbreak (Zhang et al., 2020).",

As seen in Table 1\n, ARIMA models have been successfully applied in the past to estimate the incidence and prevalence of influenza mortality, malaria incidence, hepatitis, and other infectious diseases. Besides, ARIMA models are widely used for time series prediction of epidemic diseases such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, dengue fever, and tuberculosis. ARIMA models are instrumental in modeling the temporal dependency structure of a time series, given the changing trends, periodic changes, and random distortions in the time series. It is relatively easy to explain to the end-user since ARIMA methods do not contain much mathematics or statistics. In this way, the end-user can have an idea of how the prediction model is developed and can rely more on the model during the decision-making process.",

(2020) improved the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) by applying an Enhanced Flower Pollination Algorithm using the Salp Swarm Algorithm to estimate the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China (Al-qaness et al., 2020).

In France, the other most affected European country, the first COVID-19 incident was reported on January 24, 2020, the number of deaths reached to 15,708, and the reported total confirmed cases hit to 102,533.",

            "text": "The ARIMA modeling procedure is composed of four iterative steps: assessment of the model, estimation of parameters, diagnostic checking, and prediction. The first step of the ARIMA model is to control whether the time series is stationary and seasonal. A time series is considered as stationary if its statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation are constant over time. The stationary of a time series observation is important as it will make it easier to get accurate estimates (Elevli et al., 2016). Time series plot, Autocorrelation Function (ACF), and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) graphs were constructed to check the seasonality and stationarity. The ACF graph determines whether previous values in the series are related to the following values. The PACF graph finds out the degree of correlation between a variable and a lag of the said variable that is not explained by correlation at all low-order lags (He and Tao, 2018). Estimated autocorrelations for the time series of Italy, Spain, and France are shown in Fig. 2\n. Straight lines on the graph are two standard deviations limits and allow to detect non-zero correlations. Bars that extend beyond the lines show statistically significant autocorrelations for the COVID-19 data. Fig. 1, Fig. 2 confirm that the overall prevalence of COVID-19 used in this study does not show seasonal patterns. However, the ACF plots in Fig. 2 shows that the prevalence of the COVID-19 is not stationary because autocorrelations reduce very slightly. Therefore, the first-order difference was taken to stabilize the mean of the COVID-19 prevalence. However, even after the first difference, it seems that the trends of all series not eliminated, so the second-order differences should be taken. All series became stationary after the second difference, and then parameters of ARIMA models were determined according to the ACF and PACF plots (see Appendix). In addition to the developed ARIMA models, different models were also created, and their performances were compared using various statistical tools. All statistical procedures were performed on the transformed COVID-19 data. ARIMA models with minimum MAPE values and statistically significant parameters were selected as the best models. Accordingly, the ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models were chosen as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. The models fitted the COVID-19 data reasonably well (Fig. 3\n, Table 3\n) with a minimum MAPE\nItaly = 4.752, MAPE\nSpain = 5.849, and MAPE\nFrance = 5.634 values. Table 4\nshows the parameter estimates for the best models. The p-values of the associated with the parameters are <0.05, so the terms are considerably different from zero at the 95.0% confidence level. The fitted and predicted values are presented in Fig. 4\n. As seen in Table 5\n, the next 10-day estimate of confirmed cases may be between 196,520\u2013229,147 in Italy, 204,755\u2013257,497 in Spain, and 140,320\u2013159,619 in France.",

Time series analysis is instrumental in developing hypotheses to understand the prevalence trend of various diseases and forecast the dynamics of observed phenomena, and then in the construction of a quality control system. ARIMA model is one of the most commonly used time series forecasting methods because of its simplicity and systematic structure and acceptable forecasting performance (Wang et al., 2018b).

However, the total number of confirmed cases has overtaken Italy. On the other hand, there is no downward trend in new confirmed cases in France, and it seems that more days are needed to reach the plateau.
