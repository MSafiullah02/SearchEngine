The models are denoted SIR-\u03c9 and SEIR-\u03c9, and we focus attention on the early stages of an outbreak, where we derive expression for the basic reproduction number R 0 and the expected degree of the infectious nodes E(D I ) using two different approximation approaches. The first approach approximates the early spread of an epidemic by a branching process, whereas the second one uses pair approximation. The expressions are compared with the corresponding empirical means obtained from stochastic simulations of SIR-\u03c9 and SEIR\u03c9 epidemics on Poisson and scale-free networks. Without rewiring of exposed nodes, the two approaches predict the same epidemic threshold and the same E(D I ) for both types of epidemics, the latter being very close to the mean degree obtained from simulated epidemics over Poisson networks. Above the epidemic threshold, pairwise models overestimate the value of R 0 computed from simulations, which turns out to be very close to the one predicted by the branching process approximation. When exposed individuals also rewire with \u03b1 > 0 (perhaps unaware of being infected), the two approaches give different epidemic thresholds, with the branching process approximation being more in agreement with simulations.",

Such a preventive rewiring assumes transmission of information which allows people to gather knowledge about the disease status of their neighbours.

            "text": "In addition to the previous approach, stochastic models have been used to analyze epidemic outbreaks on dynamic networks. If the contact network has a large size and no cycles, it can be locally described as a tree and the initial phase of an epidemic can be approximated by a branching process [4] . An example of a stochastic model defined on a dynamic network is the one developed in [32, 33] . The model assumes that, at a given rate, the identities of neighbours change stochastically by means of an instantaneous edge swap between a randomly selected pair of links. So, this neighbour-exchange mechanism is independent of the epidemic dynamics because it does not depend on the disease status of the involved nodes. In other words, it is not an example of behavioural response against the presence of the disease. Other models defined on dynamic networks whose architecture evolves by random edge swapping can be found in [24] . This paper aims mainly at comparing the predictions from both modelling methodologies (pairwise/stochastic) for the initial phase of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemics with preventive rewiring among individuals (so, with an interplay between the spread of the disease and the rewiring process, that is, between disease's dynamics and network dynamics). In particular, in the SIR model we will assume that susceptible individuals break off connections with infectious neighbors at a given rate \u03c9 and, in place of them, new connections to susceptible and recovered individuals are created with probability \u03b1. As for the SEIR model, we consider two alternative scenarios for the dynamics of exposeds (i.e., infected but not infectious individuals). In the first one, exposed individuals break off with their infectious neighbors at a rate \u03c9 EI and, with probability \u03b1, they reconnect to any non-infectious individual in the population. In turn, susceptibles can also reconnect, with the same probability \u03b1, to exposeds (in addition to other susceptibles and removed individuals) when breaking off with infectious neighbors. In the second scenario, exposed individuals do not rewire at all (\u03c9 EI = 0), and susceptibles rewire away from both exposeds and infectives, and create new connections with probability \u03b1. From a modeling viewpoint, the rewiring scenario can depend on whether exposed individuals realize they have been infected (for instance, because they show symptoms) or not (they are asymptomatic). In both scenarios, the degree distribution changes over time and its mean degree is preserved only when \u03b1 = 1.",

In other words, \u03b1 can be though of a measure of the intensity of social distancing of rewiring individuals.

Its predicted value will be checked against stochastic simulations carried out on contact networks with degree distributions that follow a Poisson distribution and a power law, respectively. It is worth noting that, while the meaning of R 0 in randomly mixing homogeneous populations is straightforward because any infectious individual is as likely as any other to infect a susceptible one, in heterogeneous networks it requires that one specifies the meaning of typical individual [5, 23] . In most network models (in particular, for those without multiple levels of mixing), this definition implies that one has to compute R 0 from the average number of infections per infective once the early correlations of disease status around infectious individuals have been formed, which takes a couple of generations after the occurrence of the primary cases. Interestingly, this computation/redefinition of R 0 has been obtained under both previous modelling approaches [7, 14, 25] . In fact, it is well known that both pairwise models and branching process approximations lead to the same epidemic (or invasion) threshold in networks without rewiring [15] .",

In Section 3 we use the branching process approximation to analyse the early phase of an SIR-\u03c9 epidemic. In particular, we compute R 0 and the expected degree of infectives during this initial phase as a function of the rewiring rate \u03c9. In Section 4 the same approximation is applied to the study of the early stage of an SEIR-\u03c9 epidemic under different types of rewiring processes. Section 5 contains the results of the initial phase obtained for both epidemic models using the pair approximation with the triple closure introduced in [13, 20] for heterogeneous networks. In particular, the SEIR-\u03c9 pairwise model extends the one considered in [20] to account for the rewiring of exposed individuals and the possibility that susceptibles reconnect to exposed ones after breaking off an infectious link. In Section 6 numerical estimates of R 0 and the mean degree of infectives during the initial phase are obtained from continuous-time stochastic simulations on heterogeneous networks. Finally, in Section 7 we discuss the analytical results obtained from both approximations and compare them to the output of the stochastic simulations. Moreover, we comment about the new insight into the role of the rewiring process in the SEIR-\u03c9 epidemic model.",

It is of course possible to also allow for rewiring from other states, e.g. that susceptible individuals rewire from recovered individuals, but since we are primarily focusing on the initial phase such rewiring would have negligible effects. If infected people are detected only when they become infectious (e.g. if the latent period is the same as the incubation period), and hence individuals rewire away from infected neighbors only when those become infectious and not while they are exposed, this would correspond to \u03c9 SE = 0 and \u03c9 SI = \u03c9 EI > 0: susceptible individuals are not aware of exposed (latent) neighbors being infected and hence do not rewire, and susceptible but also exposed (latent but unaware) individuals rewire away from the infectious ones. We could obtain a second scenario if also exposed (latent) individuals are known to have been infected (e.g. by contact tracing or because they show some symptoms). We would then have \u03c9 SE = \u03c9 SI > 0 and \u03c9 EI = 0: susceptible individuals rewire away both from exposed and infectious neighbors but exposed individuals do not rewire away since they know they have already been infected. In all cases, the reconnection probability \u03b1 modulates the fraction of rewirings that are effectively done, and it is assumed to be the same both for susceptibles and for exposeds.

Hence, susceptibles who break off a link with an infected neighbor reconnect to any susceptible, exposed or recovered individual with the same probabilities as the exposed ones, namely, \u03b1 It is illustrative to check that the limit system for the dynamics of the local densities of disease status around an infectious individual (see Appendix) only contains one term with the reconnection probability \u03b1, namely, the one with \u03b1 \u03c9 EI as a prefactor. Therefore, the other contributions from the remaining rewiring rates in (17) do not appear when we restrict ourselves at the early stage of an epidemic. In other words, the precise rules for reconnecting susceptibles who have rewired away from an infectious neighbor, even if there is no reconnection at all of those individuals (\u03b1 = 0), does not affect the epidemic dynamics during the initial phase. This claim, however, is not true for exposed individuals. The last term of the equation for [SE]/ [I] tells us that exposeds enhance the spread of the disease by rewiring away from infectious neighbors (because they will replace the latter with susceptible ones) and, hence, R P A 0 must increase under this rewiring.",

By using a pairwise model with a triple closure introduced in [13, 20] , and a branching process approximation of a stochastic network epidemic, we have seen that the same epidemic threshold is also predicted for dynamic networks whose topology evolves according to the preventive rewiring of susceptible individuals. As expected from a preventive rewiring, the higher the rewiring rate \u03c9, the lower R 0 is for both predictions, and this is true regardless of the value of the reconnection probability \u03b1. However, for any \u03c9, the pair approximation overestimates R 0 when it is larger than 1 as compared to stochastic simulations and to the value R BA 0 obtained from the branching process approximation. The reason is that the value R P A 0 predicted by the pairwise model is a linear function of the infection rate \u03b2 and, hence, an unbounded number of new cases is predicted as \u03b2 increases (cf. Eq. (15)). Such a linear dependence on the infection rate is a common feature of deterministic epidemic models [1] . In contrast, the hyperbolic dependence of R BA 0 on \u03b2 (cf. Eq.

Interestingly, as long as \u03b1 > 0, this rewiring of exposeds is not preventive but harmful since it does not help to contain the disease: sooner or later exposed individuals will become infectious and, when an exposed replaces its infector with a susceptible one, the number of infections he/she can produce increases.

However, the corresponding expressions are not easily manageable (both depend on the solution of a cubic equation when \u03b1 \u03c9 EI > 0) and, therefore, they have been evaluated numerically. From these evaluations, it follows that, when \u03b1 > 0 and \u03c9 EI = 0 or, alternatively, when \u03b1 = 0 (dropping of edges), both approaches lead to the same values of E(D I ). For \u03b1 \u03c9 EI > 0, predictions are almost graphically indistinguishable from each other (for \u03b1 = 1 and \u03c9 SI = \u03c9 EI , the maximum differences occur at second decimal place of the expected degree). As with the SIR-\u03c9 model, when the simulations take place on scale-free networks, the predicted E(D I ) overestimates the observed D I (t) (see Fig. 7 ).",

While the computation of R 0 is based on the initial degree distribution, the final epidemic size depends on the whole evolution of the degree distribution. In particular, since reconnection is assumed to be uniform with respect to the degree of nodes, the variance of the degree distribution decreases over time whenever the initial network is highly heterogeneous (see [13] ). Determining an expression for the final epidemic size, using any approximation method, and studying how it [I] when individuals drop connections to infectious neighbours (\u03b1 = 0).
