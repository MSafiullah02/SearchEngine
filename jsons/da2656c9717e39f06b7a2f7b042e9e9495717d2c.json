The transmission rate is heterogeneous across countries and far exceeds the recovery rate, which enables a fast spread.

The peak reduces to 6.2% under the optimal mitigation policy that controls the timing and intensity of social distancing.

To prevent the spread of the new virus, many governments have introduced draconian measures such as restricting travel, ordering social distancing, and closing schools, bars, restaurants, and other businesses.",

Nevertheless, individuals need to make everyday decisions such as how to manage inventories of staples, how much to consume and save, when to buy or sell stocks, etc., and these decisions depend on the expectation of how long and severe the epidemic is. Governments must also make decisions such as to what extent imposing travel restrictions, social distancing, closure of schools and businesses, etc., and for how long (Anderson et al., 2020) .",

This paper aims to help decision making by building a mathematical epidemic model, estimating it using the up-to-date data of COVID-19 cases around the world, making out-of-sample predictions, and discussing optimal policy and economic impact. The model is the Kermack and McKendrick (1927) Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and is relatively simple. An infected individual interacts with other agents and transmits the disease at a certain rate if the other agent is susceptible. An infected individual also recovers (or dies) at a certain rate. The model can be described as a system of ordinary differential equations, which is nonlinear due to the interaction between the infected and susceptible. The behavior of the model is completely determined by the transmission rate (\u03b2), the recovery rate (\u03b3), and the initial condition. Despite the nonlinearity, the model admits an exact analytical solution in parametric form (Harko et al., 2014) , which is convenient for estimation and prediction. Using this model, I theoretically derive the condition under which an epidemic occurs and characterize the peak of the epidemic.",

Because the situation and policies surrounding COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, I use the most recent two weeks (14 days) of cases and estimate the model parameters by nonlinear least squares. Except for China, Japan, and Korea, which are early epicenters of the outbreak, the transmission rate \u03b2 is around 0.2-0.4 and heterogeneous across countries. The estimated transmission rates far exceed the recovery rate \u03b3, which is about 0.1 based on the clinical course of COVID-19. Due to the high transmission rate and lack of herd immunity, in the absence of mitigation measures such as social distancing, the virus spreads quickly and may infect around 30 percent of the population at the peak of the epidemic. Using the model, I conduct an experiment where the government introduces temporary mitigation measures and succeeds in reducing the transmission rate. If the mitigation measures are taken too early, the peak is delayed but the epidemic restarts with no effect on the peak because the population does not acquire herd immunity. Assuming the government can take drastic measures up to 12 weeks, the optimal policy is start mitigation measures once the number of cases reaches 6.3% of the population. Under the optimal policy, the peak infection rate reduces to 6.2%. Therefore unless vaccines are expected to be developed in the near future, the draconian measures currently taken in many countries may be suboptimal, and it may be desirable to postpone them.",

Hence the only way to satisfy the no-epidemic condition \u03b2(1 \u2212 z 0 ) \u2264 \u03b3 is either (i) control transmission (reduce \u03b2), for example by washing hands, wearing protective gear, restricting travel, or social distancing, or (ii) immunization (increase z 0 ).

Despite the short time series (14 days), the transmission rate is precisely estimated in most countries. Although current data is insufficient to draw any conclusion, there are a few possible explanations for the heterogeneity of \u03b2. First, the transmission rate \u03b2 may artificially appear high in later epicenters such as Europe and North America just because these countries were slow in adopting tests of COVID-19 and the testing (hence reporting) rate is increasing. Second, the heterogeneity in \u03b2 may be due to the fact that early epicenters have already taken mitigation measures of COVID-19. For example, while Japan closed all schools starting on March 2, many states in US have implemented similar measures such as closing schools, bars, and restaurants only around March 16, so we may not have yet seen the effect of such policies. Finally, it is possible that there are cultural differences. For example, school children in Japan are taught to wash their hands before eating and to gargle after returning home, which they practice, and (from personal experience) Japanese cities tend to be much cleaner than most cities in the world. Second, according to the model, countries other than China, Japan, and Korea are significantly affected by the epidemic. If the current trend in the transmission rate \u03b2 continues, the epidemic will peak in May 2020, at which point around 30 percent of the population will be infected by the virus simultaneously. By the time the epidemic ends, more than 90 percent of the population is eventually infected. These numbers can be used to do a back-of-the-envelope calculation of health outcomes. In February 2020, the cruise ship Diamond Princess was put under quarantine for two weeks after COVID-19 was detected. All passengers were tested and tracked, among whom 712 tested positive and 8 died. Although this is not a representative sample because the cruise ship passengers tend to be older and wealthier, the mortality of COVID-19 should be around 1% for this group and possibly lower for the general population. Zhou et al. (2020) document that 54 patients died among 191 that required hospitalization in two hospitals in Wuhan. Therefore the ratio of patients requiring hospitalization to death is 191/54 = 3.56. Thus, based on the model, the fraction of people requiring hospitalization at the peak is y max \u00d7 0.01 \u00d7 3.56 = 1.0% assuming y max = 28%, the median value in Table 1 .",

The epidemic starts with the initial condition (y 0 , z 0 ) = (10 \u22128 , 0). The benchmark transmission rate is set to the median value in Table 1 , which is \u03b2 = 0.29. When the number of total cases c = y + z exceeds 10 \u22125 , the government introduces mitigation measures such as social distancing, and the transmission rate changes to either \u03b2 = 0.2 or \u03b2 = 0.1. 5 Mitigation measures are lifted after 12 weeks and the transmission rate returns to the benchmark value. I also consider the optimal mitigation policy, where the government chooses the threshold of casesc to introduce mitigation measures as well as the transmission rate \u03b2 to minimize the maximum infection rate y max . Figure 3 shows the fraction of infected and recovered over time. When the government introduces early but temporary mitigation measures (left panel), the epidemic is delayed but the peak is unaffected. This is because the maximum infection rate y max in (2.6) is mostly determined by \u03b2 and \u03b3 since (x 0 , y 0 ) \u2248 (1, 0), and the epidemic persists until the population acquires herd immunity so that the no-epidemic condition \u03b2x \u2264 \u03b3 holds. While early drastic mitigation measures might be useful to buy time to develop a vaccine, they may not be effective in mitigating the peak unless they are permanent.",

This number implies that it takes only 1/\u03b2 \u2248 3 days for a patient to infect another individual. Since it takes around 10 days to recover from the illness, the number of patients will grow exponentially and may overwhelm the healthcare system if no actions are taken. If the current trend continues, the epidemic will peak in early May 2020 in Europe and North America, at which point around 30 percent of the population will be infected. Because the recovery rate \u03b3 is an uncontrollable biological parameter, the only way to control the epidemic is to reduce the transmission rate \u03b2, perhaps by restricting travel or social distancing. However, temporary measures only slows the onset of the epidemic but has no effect on the peak because the epidemic persists until the population acquires herd immunity. The optimal policy that minimizes the peak is to wait to introduce mitigation measures until a sufficient fraction of the population is infected, which can reduce the peak to 6.2%.
