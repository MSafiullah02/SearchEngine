Even more concerned are people with spinal cord injuries (SCI) who are at increased risk from the COVID-19 disease. People with tetraplegia or high-level paraplegia and reduced lung function may be at higher risk of having more severe problems with COVID-19. However, we still do not know how much greater that risk is. Most people infected with COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment [2]. The WHO states that older people and those with underlying medical problems are more likely to develop serious illness [2]. We assume that the rate of pneumonia will now, congruent to the general population, also increase in the SCI population due to COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of death in those with SCI from pneumonia and influenza, are significantly higher than in the general population [3].",
