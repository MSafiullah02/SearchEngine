FCoV is classified into serotypes I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein (Motokawa et al., 1995, Motokawa et al., 1996). Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: FIPV and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats. In contrast, FIPV infection causes FIP. It has been proposed that FIPV arises from FECV by mutation (Poland et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1998), but the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarified. Stoddart and Scott (1989) reported that the proliferation in peritoneal macrophages was associated with the virulence of FIPV because FECV exhibited a lower proliferation in peritoneal macrophages than FIPV.",

However, a few mutations were found in genome despite the fact that mar mutant viruses were generated from FIPV 79-1146 (type II FCoV) during several passages, independently of each other in different cultures in the presence of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Although the reason for this contradiction is unclear, a difference in the fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase between types I and II FCoV may have been involved. Vignuzzi et al. (2006) suggested that genomic diversity decreases in viruses with high-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

However, mar 5-7-2.C1 becomes less virulent in cats, although it proliferated well in monocytes/macrophages in vitro. This result is inconsistent with a theory that the proliferation of FCoV in monocytes/macrophages correlates with virulence. Pedersen (2009) reported that oral inoculation using strain FIPV 79-1146 caused FIP in 92.6% of cats, and intraperitoneal inoculation, 100%. In contrast, oral inoculation using strain FIPV UCD4 caused FIP in 0% of cats, and intraperitoneal inoculation, 37.5%. Thus, mar 5-7-2.C1 may also become virulent via other inoculation routes. In the future, the association among the proliferation in monocytes/macrophages, onset of FIP, and the developmental mechanism via a parenteral transmission route should be examined using strain mar 5-7-2.C1 and other mar mutant viruses. In addition, it is necessary to prepare MAb 5-7-2-resistant mutant virus without the mutation of regions other than the neutralizing epitope and perform a similar experiment.",

(2009) theoretically demonstrated that FIP develops via the horizontal infection of FIPV. On the basis of their theory, FIPV and FECV are prevalent among cats. As mentioned above, some FIPV may cause few clinical symptoms via some transmission routes. As indicated in our results, the virulence of FIPV alters based on a few amino acid changes. From these results, FCoV, including FIPV, is regarded as a group of various virulent viruses. In the future, changes in virulence caused by gene mutations and the manifestation of virulence due to transmission routes should be examined for FCoV to comprehensively elucidate the virulence of FIPV.",

If an agent which inhibits FIPV infection of monocytes/macrophages is developed, it may be used to treat FIP. For example, neutralizing epitope-binding peptidomimetics may inhibit FIPV infection of monocytes/macrophages without exhibiting ADE activity. However, the neutralizing or antibody-dependent enhancing epitope of type I FIPV, accounting for about 80% of field FIPV, has not been identified, unlike type II FIPV. To prepare a therapeutic drug targeting the neutralizing epitope, identification of the neutralizing epitope in type I FIPV is necessary. Recently, a method for preparing type I FCoV employing a reverse genetics system has also been established (Tekes et al., 2008). In the future, it will be desirable to examine the neutralizing/antibody-dependent enhancing epitope of type I FCoV in vitro and in vivo.",

Indeed, a few amino acid changes were demonstrated in the mar mutant viruses but the viruses with reduced virulence also had the deletion in the 7b gene. ORF 7b gene deletions are probably readily acquired during passage of FCoV in vitro and have been suggested to correlate with loss of virulence (Herrewegh et al., 1995). We speculated that important virulence mutations actually related to deletions in 7b gene in this study. We suggested that mutations in the neutralizing epitope of type II FIPV and deletions in ORF 7b gene are related to loss of virulence also in cats. In descried above, the FCoV-infected cats developing FIP are not type II FIPV in fields, and it is mostly type I FIPV (Hohdatsu et al., 1992, Kummrow et al., 2005, Pedersen, 2009).
