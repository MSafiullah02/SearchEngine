To determine prevalence, clinical features and perform phylogenetic analysis in HBoV infected Thai pediatric patients. Methods: HBoV was detected from 302 nasopharyngeal (NP) suctions of pediatric patients with acute lower respiratory tract illness and sequenced applying molecular techniques. Results: The incidence of HBoV infection in pediatric patients amounted to 6.62% with 40% coinfected with other respiratory viruses. There were no clinical specific manifestations for HBoV; however, fever and productive cough were commonly found. Generalized rales and wheezing were detected in most of the patients as well as perihilar infiltrates. The alignment and phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 genes showed minor variations. Conclusion: Our results indicated that HBoV can be detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from infants and children with acute lower respiratory tract illness.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infection is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide. In most cases, viruses including influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are the causative agents. Recently, a new respiratory tract virus of the Parvoviridae family, Human Bocavirus (HBoV), has been discovered applying molecular analysis on pooled respiratory tract aspirations taken from children in Sweden. This virus is closely related to the bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus, which have been classified as members of the genus Bocavirus. The virus comprises two major open reading frames (ORFs) encoding a nonstructural protein (NS1) and at least two capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2), respectively. Moreover, the HBoV genome also contains a third middle ORF encoding a nonstructural protein (NP1) of unknown function. 1 The most conserved region of this virus is the NS1 and NP1 gene whereas the VP1/VP2 gene constitutes the variable region. 2 The induction of respiratory illness by HBoV is not clearly defined due to lack of propagation techniques in cell culture or animal models. 1 However, many studies have reported this virus infection to be associated with acute respiratory illness. 1, 3, 4 Upon discovery of HBoV in respiratory pools, its global prevalence has been reported to range from 1.5% to 19% and co-infection with other viruses was commonly found. 1,3e24 Moreover, in few studies were shown negative results for HBoV infection in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from healthy volunteers. 20, 25, 26 Additional epidemiological and clinical investigation will be essential in order to elucidate what exactly engenders HBoV related illness. Therefore, in the present study we applied polymerase chain reaction to detect HBoV from NP suctions collected from infants or children who had been admitted with respiratory tract illness.",

The sequencing products were subjected to a Perkin Elmer 310 Sequencer (Perkine Elmer) for subsequent sequence analysis. The DNA sequences were analyzed with the BLAST (http://www. ncbi.nlm.gov/BLAST) program and the phylogenetic analyses and genetic comparisons between HBoV strains were performed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version 3.1 program.",

It can be concluded from epidemiology data that HBoV has been distributed throughout every continent with a different incidence rate (1.5% to 19%). In this study, the NP suctions had been collected from pediatric patients hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract illness. HBoV has been detected in 20 (6.62%) out of 302 NP suction samples, whereas the previous study in the rural area of Thailand had the prevalence of 4.5%. 18 Co-infection with other respiratory viruses was found in 40% of the samples tested. RSV and parainfluenza virus were frequently detected as co-infecting viruses. However, some of the respiratory viruses were not included in this study, for examples; rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. Therefore, the percentage of co-infection may be higher than this report. Thailand has a tropical climate country and seasonal detection of HBoV can not be deduced from the few (1e3)",

Moreover, the study of Mannig et al. reported a similarity in seasonal appearance between HBoV and RSV 12 whereas Weissbrich et al. did not. 16 The clinical features commonly found in HBoV positive patients were fever and productive cough. Bilateral rales and wheezing were among the most common abnormal lung signs observed and almost equally found in these patients (Table 1) . These findings might indicate both lung parenchyma and airway involvement by this pathogen. Furthermore, the detection of this virus in specimens aspirated from the nasopharynx together with the significant lower respiratory tract illness indicated the lung pathology in these patients. In conclusion, we detected HBoV infection in 6.62% and co-infection with other respiratory viruses in 40% of the NP suctions obtained from infants and children with acute lower respiratory tract illness with non-specific clinical features and age distribution. Seasonal appearance of HBoV was not significant. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene, the low genetic diversity was defined. The present study has investigated associations of HBoV with clinical manifestations and performed genome analysis but in order to completely describe this novel virus, further studies on serology, tissue and animal culture systems or clinical manifestation inductions will be required.",
