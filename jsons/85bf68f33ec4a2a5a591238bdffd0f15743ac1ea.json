Influenza infection has been associated with increased risk of various neurological complications. We conducted a populationbased registry study to investigate the risk of acute hospitalization of MS patients in relation to influenza infection or pandemic vaccination in Norway. The entire Norwegian population in the years 2008-2014 was defined as our study population (N = 5,219,296). Information on MS diagnosis, influenza infection and vaccination were provided by Norwegian national registries. The self-controlled case series method was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in defined risk periods. 6755 MS patients were identified during the study period. Average age at first registration of an MS diagnosis was 51.8 years among men and 49.9 years among females (66.9%). The IRR for emergency hospitalization among MS patients the first week after an influenza diagnosis was 3.4 (95% CI 2.4-4.8). The IRR was 5.6 (95% CI 2.7-11.3) after pandemic influenza, and 4.8 (95% CI 3.1-7.4) after seasonal influenza. Pandemic vaccination did not influence risk of hospitalization [IRR within the first week: 0.7 (95% CI 0.5-1.0)]. Among MS patients, influenza infection was associated with increased risk for acute hospitalization while no increased risk was observed after pandemic vaccination. Influenza vaccination could prevent worsening of MS-related symptoms as well as risk of hospitalization.",

Immunological mechanisms are thought to play an important role in the development of MS due to interaction between environmental and genetic risk factors [1] . MS patients are at increased risk of infections, as disease-modifying therapies may alter the normal function of the immune system, or due to underlying changes in immune response [2] . Although hospitalization rates among MS patients have declined over the past few decades, they remain generally higher than in the general population [3] [4] [5] . MS-related factors and infections are the main causes of hospitalizations among MS patients. Increased exacerbation rates in MS patients have been reported after influenza illness [6] similar to what has been observed after systemic or general viral infections [7] [8] [9] . Viral infections have been shown to be associated with clinical activity of MS [2, [8] [9] [10] , hence infectious diseases such as influenza may induce relapses and cause acute Data from the Norwegian Patient Registry has been used in this publication.

In Norway, the public health care system is financed through governmental funding and all hospitalizations are free of charge. MS is a serious condition which is most likely treated in hospitals, meaning that information on hospitalization is recorded in the national registries. Norwegian health registries and databases have high quality with mandatory reporting and minimal loss to follow-up. Another strength of the study was the SCCS method accounting for any factor or characteristic that is not measured but remains constant over the observation period, such as genetics, gender, socio-economic status, and lifestyle related factors [25] .",

We believe that our inclusion criteria for MS patients (patients with at least two registered diagnoses in specialist care or combination of information on diagnoses in specialist care with information on use of MS medications) provided a highly reliable identification of MS patients. It is likely that we mostly included patients with the relapsing-remitting form with or without secondary progression. Primary progressive MS cases accounts for 10-15% of the overall population with MS, and these patients may be missed or under-represented in our study [6, 28] .",

It has been estimated that around 5-10% of the population is infected with influenza during a regular season [29] . During the 2009 pandemic outbreak less than 4% of the general Norwegian population were diagnosed with influenza by a primary care physician [15, 30] , however the clinical attack rate of influenza was estimated to be approximately 25-30.0% [21] . In our study sample, the overall proportion in the general population with an influenza diagnosis during the 2009 pandemic outbreak was 2.5%. Among MS patients, 4% were diagnosed with pandemic influenza. This supports that MS patients were more likely to seek medical help when having influenza, possibly due to the seriousness of MS disease and the potential risks associated with having an influenza infection. It could also reflect that MS patients are more susceptible to influenza than healthy persons [2] . However, as those with very mild influenza or milder symptoms of MS may have been less likely to seek health care, our results may reflect associations with more severe influenza symptoms, or associations in patients with more severe MS. Another possible weakness is the potential misclassification when using influenza diagnoses from primary care. However, our results remained similar to the main analysis when including only cases with laboratory confirmed pandemic influenza.",

We observed that a higher proportion of MS patients were vaccinated against pandemic influenza compared with the general population. MS patients were defined as a risk group and were especially recommended pandemic vaccination. In our study, we did not observe any change in risk of acute hospitalization following pandemic vaccination which is in concordance with previous findings on safety of vaccination. Vaccination is considered as a possible trigger for autoimmune disease activity such as MS, however, previous studies as well as the current indicate that immunization is safe and may prevent influenza infection and potential complications. For MS patients, type and timing of vaccine (with inactivated influenza virus or live attenuated) combined with MS specific medications (interferon-beta versus non-interferon-beta medications) should be considered carefully [9] . In our sub-analyses, stratified by interferon-beta and non-interferon-beta medications, we found no differences in risk estimates related to vaccination.",

Such study designs are prone to selection/recall bias, and small study samples which may undermine the internal and external validity of a study.

However, we utilized timing of events in the SCCS model in which patients serve as their own control, which enable us to address effects of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. SCCS models, to our knowledge, have not previously been applied in this context. Careful consideration of vaccination, taking the patient's personal history into account, could help preventing infections and worsening of MS-related symptoms.",
