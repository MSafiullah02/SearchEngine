More recently our view of the roles of lipids in viral infection has greatly expanded. We now recognize that lipids organize the subcellular localization of key events in the virus life cycle. Viruses encode proteins that coopt lipid signaling and synthesis machinery to remodel the host cell. This serves to establish protected sites of replication and generate lipids for envelopment. Furthermore, there are numerous mechanisms for how viruses modulate host-cell lipid metabolism to promote efficient virus replication.",

An emerging theme is that uncovering new virus\u2013lipid interactions not only enhances our understanding of the virus\u2013host interaction, it expands antiviral therapeutic approaches to include drugs that target lipid metabolism.",

            "text": "Cellular lipid membranes are the first barrier to viral infection of the host cell and an important initial point of interaction for viruses. In some cases, viruses can exploit lipids to use them as viral receptors (Figure 1a). For non-enveloped viruses, the virus capsid can interact directly with specific components of host-cell membranes, usually glycosphingolipids, as receptors to initiate infection (reviewed in [1]). Polyomaviruses, for example, bind glycosphingolipids upon association with a host cell and the specific bound ganglioside will determine the internalization pathway used 2, 3. Alternatively, lipid trafficking receptors can function as indirect viral receptors (Figure 1b). Members of the Flaviviridae, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bovine viral diarrheal virus (BVDV), have been shown to require functional low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) for virus entry 4, 5. Although additional high-affinity receptors are known to be required for HCV entry, the requirement for an early, low-affinity LDL-R interaction is probably a reflection of virion association with apolipoproteins which serves to bring the virus in proximity to other entry cofactors (reviewed in [6]) (Figure 1b). Similarly, the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) is an HCV receptor that is known to interact with the high-density lipoprotein HDL [7]. Although the virus glycoproteins directly interact with SR-BI, there is evidence that HDL/HCV/SR-B1 interactions can also influence the infectivity of HCV (reviewed in [8]).",

Lipid microenvironments influence the entry of some viruses, frequently by influencing the clustering of receptors in cholesterol-rich subdomains (Figure 1c). Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) fails to enter host cells that have been depleted for cholesterol via treatment with \u03b2-cyclodextran [9], implicating a lipid as a required cofactor for HIV-1 entry. Further mechanistic work showed that cholesterol is essential to bring the viral receptors into proximity and initiate entry complex formation [10]. Host-cell lipid microdomains are similarly required for murine coronavirus entry [11] and pseudorabies virus entry [12]. In addition, some viruses require cholesterol in the virus envelope for efficient virus entry. This has been reported for influenza A virus [13] and human herpes virus 6 [11], however, the exact role for virus envelope cholesterol remains unclear.",

Following internalization, virions can be sorted into appropriate endosomal compartments from which they eventually fuse out. Specific lipids can influence the compartment of virion uncoating (Figure 1d). Recent work on dengue virus (DENV) has shown that virus fusion with late endosomes is specifically induced by the presence of a late endosome-specific lipid species bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) [15]. Interestingly, low pH alone is ineffective in stimulating virus fusion in the absence of BMP. Similarly, alphaviruses require cholesterol and sphingolipids for optimal virus endosomal fusion, (reviewed in [16]). Thus, specific lipid species appear to influence the ability of viruses to initiate infection at multiple stages of the virus entry process.",

Although the morphology of these structures are distinct, they are thought to serve three common purposes: (i) provide a physical scaffold on which the virus replicase can assemble, (ii) increase the local concentration of the viral and cellular cofactors required for replication, and (iii) provide a protected environment that limits recognition of virus protein and nucleic acid by the innate immune system. Positive-stranded RNA viruses can form replication complexes from different cytosolic membrane sources including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, endosomes and/or lysosomes, and mitochondria; and their mechanism of formation probably differs (reviewed in 17, 18). The importance of the source of membrane is unclear. At least in the case of Flock House virus (FHV), replication is not perturbed by targeting replication complex formation to an abnormal subcellular location [19]. Advances in electron tomography have allowed the first appreciation of the 3D structure of virus replication factories 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. For these viruses, the replication membranes are contiguous with either the ER or mitochondria. They are severely remodeled, producing enclosed pockets or invaginations for the viruses to replicate inside, with a neck to release the RNA, frequently into an associated virion-assembly compartment. Other viruses, such as HCV and the picornaviruses, appear to have a different structure involving the potential clustering of heterogeneous vesicles (reviewed in 17, 18).",

Initially the question of how membranes are reorganized was addressed by identifying virus requirements for the formation of these membrane structures. Individual virus proteins were overexpressed in cells, which were then examined by electron microscopy to identify membrane structures that resemble those found in infected cells. This approach has identified HCV NS4B 26, 27, flavivirus NS4A 28, 29 and enterovirus nonstructural protein 2BC, possibly in combination with the 3A protein 30, 31, 32, 33, as being capable of inducing membrane alterations. The exact mechanism by which these virus proteins alter membrane organization however, is generally unclear. Further complexities have been revealed by work on brome mosaic virus (BMV) which has shown that not only the virus proteins but their interactions and relative expression levels can lead to different membrane morphologies [34].",

Specifically, much work has been carried out on host-cell cofactors that have functions in host lipid-membrane metabolism. Both enteroviruses and HCV appear to coopt lipid signaling to influence the formation of these structures (Figure 2a). It has been shown by several groups that host genes involved in phosphatidylinositol (PI) signaling influence HCV and enterovirus replication 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. These reports have led to a model wherein the modulation of these lipid signaling molecules directs cellular membrane trafficking to coalesce with virus proteins to generate replication complex (RC) formation [41]. HCV infection or NS5A expression stimulates cellular PI4P production by the PI4-kinase III-alpha [42]. This activity is required for the formation of appropriate membrane RCs. Enteroviruses require the related PI4-kinase III-beta. Further, the enterovirus RNA polymerase 3Dpol physically binds PI4P, which could influence both its association with cellular membranes and its ability to synthesize RNA (Figure 2a) [40].",

In West Nile virus (WNV) infection, the cholesterol-synthesizing enzyme 3-hydroxy-methyglutaryl-CoA reductase as well as cellular cholesterol are redistributed to virus RCs during replication [46]. The related DENV also depends on cholesterol biosynthesis [47]. In addition to the importance of cholesterol, DENV NS3 recruits the host enzyme fatty acid synthase to sites of virus replication and stimulates its activity to synthesize fatty acids [48]. A major theme of these studies is that simply inducing membrane curvature is probably insufficient to create the functional replication complexes seen in virus replication. There are additional requirements for altering both the total membrane content and specific lipid composition that impact upon membrane fluidity. A second emerging theme is that the formation of these structures might not simply be the function of one virus protein. Although HCV NS4B expression drives membrane remodeling, NS5A modulation of PI4-kinase activity clearly influences the process [42]. Similarly, DENV NS3 modulation of fatty acid synthesis probably influences the ability of NS4A to drive the formation of RC structures.",

The roles of post-translational lipid modifications with some viral examples is reviewed in [49]. Using HCV as an example, it has been shown that the virus protein NS4B is palmitoylated in an overexpression system [50] and this palmitoylation is required for virus replicase formation. In addition, palmitoylation of the HCV core protein is required for virus particle formation [51]. Geranylgeranylation of the host cofactor FBL2 is also required for HCV replication [52]. This gave hope that drugs targeting cholesterol synthesis such as statins could be useful for treating HCV infection. Although successful in inhibiting HCV replication in vitro, this approach only modestly improves the sustained antiviral response in patients [53].",

There were also specific lipid metabolism changes; in particular, there was an increase in the flux of metabolites channeled into fatty acid biosynthesis pathway [56]. The authors further showed that inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis inhibited CMV infection and thus identified a possible antiviral target. James Alwine and colleagues discuss the metabolic changes in CMV infection in much greater detail in another review in this themed issue [57]. Another herpesvirus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus, provokes similar changes in cell metabolism that resemble the Warburg effect \u2013 an increase in aerobic glycolysis and a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation \u2013 as part of its latent infection [58].",

For example, the proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation are more abundant in HCV-infected cells but show no differential regulation in microarray studies. Complementary lipidomic analysis of HCV-infected cells also revealed that there were changes in specific lipid species (e.g. phospholipids and sphingomyelins), and these are predicted to play roles in virus replication as well as assembly and secretion events [60].

Lipid droplets are well characterized as the sites of HCV assembly [64] and have also been proposed to be involved in DENV assembly [65]. HCV core localizes to lipid droplets that are in proximity to ER-associated virus structural proteins. A current model is that HCV replication occurs at the membranous web discussed earlier and then nascent RNA is transported to lipid droplets by the virus replicase proteins NS3 and NS5A. Assembly of virus RNA into capsids is thought to take place at lipid droplets and requires the virus NS2 and p7 proteins [66]. It is thought that assembly at lipid droplets might influence lipid-associated secretion of HCV (discussed later). Interestingly, HCV core protein expression enhances the accumulation of lipid droplets in the perinuclear region. This phenomenon appears to be genotype-specific and linked to assembly efficiency [67]. One possible mechanism for core and lipid-droplet association is an interaction of HCV core with DGAT-1, which promotes lipid droplet formation [68].",

Lipid signaling also helps to organize HIV budding sites by recruiting the major HIV structural protein, Gag. The localization of Gag to lipid rafts at the plasma membrane is dependent on the interactions of the Gag protein with the lipid signaling molecule PI-(4,5)-bisphosphate, which is enriched at the plasma membrane 71, 72, 73. The lipid interaction with Gag is thought to ensure the appropriate subcellular localization of virus structural proteins for virion assembly and budding.

Recently, the lipidomic profile of HCV virions was determined, which closely resembles that of low- and very-low-density lipoproteins [81]. HCV isolated from infected patients contained components of the VLDL machinery, including apolipoproteins (Apo) B and E [82]. Further, knockdown of ApoB and ApoE decreased the amount of intracellular as well as secreted infectious virus, indicating that apolipoproteins play a role in both secretion and infectivity 83, 84.

            "text": "Figure 1: Roles for lipids in virus entry. (a) Lipids as direct viral receptors. The virus protein coat of non-enveloped viruses, such as polyomaviruses, can associate with lipids on the cell surface [1]. In many cases these lipids display a carbohydrate moiety (brown) that directly interacts with the virus protein coat (yellow). This interaction leads to internalization of the virus and the initiation of infection. (b) Lipid receptors as indirect viral receptors. Viruses (yellow) such as HCV and BVDV, which associate with LDL in the blood, can be brought into proximity of a target cells via the association between LDL and its receptor (LDL-R) 4, 5. Subsequently, interaction with high-affinity cell-surface viral receptors (orange) facilitates infection. (c) Lipids as entry cofactors. Lipids can modulate the ability of a virus to enter the cell after initial receptor interactions. Many viruses (yellow) such as influenza, HIV, and Ebola virus enter cells at lipid microdomains (orange) or require lipid microdomains for some step of virus entry (reviewed in [86]). (d) Lipids as virus fusion cofactors. Some viruses (yellow), such as DENV, utilize specific lipids (green) in order to stimulate virus envelope fusion with target membranes [15].",

            "text": "Figure 2: Roles for lipids and lipid signaling in replication complex formation and function. (a) Phosphoinositide signaling. Phosphoinositides (PIs) are negatively charged lipids with a specific head-group that can be phosphorylated at different positions to generate PI-phosphates (PIPs). PIPs can direct cell signaling in a pro-viral manner or directly bind to virus proteins during HCV and enterovirus infection 40, 42. (b) Membrane curvature. There are several ways in which viruses can induce membrane curvature. First, the virus can cause the accumulation of cone-shaped lipids (such as lysophosphatidylcholine, LPC) in one leaflet of the membrane bilayer, and this can lead to membrane bending (top). Second, the virus can encode a membrane-associated protein that induces membrane curvature (e.g. HCV NS4B and flavivirus NS4A, middle) 26, 28. Third, the virus can utilize host membrane proteins that induce membrane curvature, such as reticulons (RTNs, bottom) [43], which have been shown to be required for BMV membrane rearrangements. It is important to note that these are not mutually exclusive and a virus could use several strategies to accomplish membrane bending. (c) Membrane expansion. WNV and DENV actively recruit lipid-biosynthesis machinery to generate lipids at sites of replication 46, 48. This helps to form the replication complexes. Further, membrane expansion might be important in generating lipids for the virus envelope. (d) Membrane dynamics. Viruses such as DENV or WNV, which recruit lipid-biosynthesis machinery to RCs, can modulate membrane fluidity and plasticity of replication complex membranes by desaturating lipid tails or leading to the accumulation of cholesterol, as has been seen during BMV infection 44, 45. These modulations probably lead to a membrane environment that is conducive to viral replication complex formation or function.",

            "text": "Figure 3: Modulating lipid metabolism can lead to the generation of energy for virus replication. The virus replication cycle is an energy-intensive process. Several reports have shown that the metabolic state of the infected cell can be shifted towards energy generation. Lipids and lipid stores represent vast pools of energy that are exploited during virus replication. Some viruses, such as HCV, appear to induce lipid metabolism both transcriptionally [59] and post-transcriptionally [60] to facilitate lipid oxidation and ATP generation. In addition, some viruses, such as DENV, can induce cytosolic processes, such as autophagy, which can lead to the degradation of lipid droplets (LDs) [63]. The lipids released from LDs are oxidized at mitochondria, leading to oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to generate ATP.",

            "text": "Figure 4: Lipids, lipid signaling and membrane scission in virus assembly and release. (a) Lipids in HIV assembly and release. HIV assembly and release requires specific lipids at multiple stages. Initially, the structural protein Gag is recruited to pre-budding sites by its association with the lipid phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) [72]. In addition, the membrane composition of these sites is specific, containing high amounts of sphingolipids and cholesterol [69]. As the virus begins to bud, there is significant membrane curvature that needs to be induced and then resolved, a process known as membrane scission. In the case of HIV, membrane scission is accomplished by coopting cellular machinery known as the ESCRT machinery. The ESCRT complex facilitates membrane scission and the release of the virus [76]. (b) Lipids in influenza virus assembly and release. Influenza A similarly associates with specific lipid microdomains during the budding process, however, the mechanism of membrane scission is significantly different. Instead of utilizing the ESCRT complex, the virus genome encodes the M2 protein, which serves an analogous function to the ESCRT complex and facilitates virus budding without a requirement for host machinery [77].",
