Molecular methods have enabled the detection of a number of unknown viruses in respiratory tract samples such as several coronaviruses as well as the human bocavirus (hBoV).1, 2, 3 Most recently, two novel viruses of the family polyomaviridae were detected in respiratory samples and named KI polyomavirus4 and WU polyomavirus (WUPyV).5 Two human polyomaviruses were known before, the JC and BK polyomavirus. These viruses cause persisting infections, which are usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals but may lead to severe disease under immunosuppression.6\n",

Strikingly, coinfections were detected in 72% of the patients. Meanwhile, similar findings of WUPyV detection have been reported from South Korea, Canada, Scotland, the United States, and Germany with prevalence rates ranging from 1.6% to 7%.7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Because WUPyV DNA was also detected in samples of a control group without respiratory symptoms, the clinical relevance of positive WUPyV DNA results in respiratory samples has been questioned.11 Rather, positive WUPyV DNA results in the respiratory tract may constitute an incidental detection of a persistent virus. However, further investigations are necessary to clarify this issue.",

In our validation experiments, this assay proved to be sensitive, specific, and reliable for WUPyV DNA amplification. Quantification was possible over a broad linear range. We found WUPyV DNA in 5.2% of NPA obtained from infants and children with respiratory tract diseases during the years 2002\u20132005 and 2007 in the region of northern Bavaria in Germany. PCR inhibition by NPA was not assessed as part of this study, but data from our routine diagnostic lab demonstrate that inhibition occurs in less than 1% of NPA (unpublished observation). Two other studies using real-time PCR and probe detection for WUPyV amplification have been published thus far.9, 15 However, detailed descriptions of analytical assay characteristics and quantitative data of clinical samples were not provided.",

While very high viral loads of greater than 109\n copies/ml were found in a small proportion (4.7%) of the WUPyV DNA positive NPA, the majority of these samples (51.6%) contained only low viral loads of less than 1000 copies/ml. Although the significance of viral load results in NPA is limited to some extent because of technical variations in the acquisition procedure (e.g. the volume of the NPA on arrival in the lab ranged approximately from 1 to 10 ml), the observed viral loads in patient samples differed by a factor of 108, a range much larger than could be accounted for by variation in NPA volumes obtained. In analogy to hBoV,16 the observed WUPyV load distribution is compatible with primary WUPyV infection associated with high viral loads in few of the children and incidental detection of low copy numbers of persistent virus in most of the children.",
