Thirty (79%) patients agreed to use the app, six (16%) patients did not have access to a mobile phone or tablet and were therefore excluded, two (1%) patients refused to use the app. During the tele-consultation at 5-7 days after the initial patient contact, the patients\u00b4 feedback was overwhelmingly positive. In total, 651 measurements were recorded and the quality of just 64 (10%) measurements was too low for automatic analysis. The FibriCheck algorithm defined 398 (61%) measurements as normal sinus rhythm, 143 (22%) as AF and 46 (7%) as sinus rhythm with extrasystoles. The average number of measurements per participant was 22. After each measurement, symptoms were assessed by the app: 77% of measurements were asymptomatic, dyspnea was present in 5%, palpitations in 2%, chest pain in 1% and in 15% other symptoms were reported. FibriCheck information was used for management of rate and rhythm control medication in patients planned for AF outpatient clinic or follow-up after AF ablation.",

The goal was to monitor rate and rhythm remotely just around tele-consultations to allow a better assessment of the disease state of the patient and to support in treatment decisions.
