Based on clinical elements and results of investigations, a diagnosis would have been generated and appropriate therapy introduced. Today, in the COVID-19 era, a patient can be at risk of receiving a misdiagnosis, especially in the emergency setting, because symptoms like fever, tachypnea, and consciousness alteration may be interpreted as solely related to a COVID-19 infection with the consequent primary target of excluding it, for example for decreasing the risk of contagion. This approach, induced by the fear and high-level stress induced by the pandemic on the health care personnel, can generate some delay in the correct diagnosis and therapy initiation, or even a misdiagnosis with all the possible consequences.",

The patient has had a fever for the 3 previous days and, in the afternoon before hospitalization, she had been seen clumsy in movement and slowed in reasoning and speech. Her sister had attributed this condition to the febrile state and a possible, yet non-testified, epileptic event, because the patient had a history of epilepsy since the age of 62; consequently, she decided not to carry the patient to ER or to call her family practitioner. The patient had been on valproic acid (VPA) 300 mg b.i.d. for the last 5 years with incomplete control of crises (a couple of episodes of generalized seizure/year). Laboratory exams, including liver function markers and VPA levels, had always been within the range of normality since then.",

The diagnosis of HSV-1 encephalitis was somehow delayed in this patient for a number of reasons. The first one was a possible delay in the delivery of this patient to the ER, possibly because relatives were scared of bringing the patient to an environment reputed at high risk of COVID-19 contagion. In fact, while the general Italian population has been invited to stay home in the case of fever and to call the general practitioner to reduce the patient burden of ER, many people do not know about the presence of differentiated COVID+ and COVID-free pathways in the ER. Second and perhaps more relevant, the fact that in the ER, each patient is today first hypothesized to have a COVID-19-related condition, a conviction that forces many colleagues to first working to exclude it, before of hypothesizing other diseases, on the basis of symptoms and history. Even the presence of a possible ischemic lesions, and therefore the diagnosis of stroke, was related in the ER to an underlying COVID-19 infection, perhaps in relation to the emerging news about the supposed presence of a thrombophilia induced by the COVID-19 [2, 3].",

Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic poses everybody at a higher risk of making a certain amount of indirect victims related to COVID-induced misdiagnosis. In this regard, it should be noted that despite the involvement of the central nervous system in COVID-19 infection has been frequently mentioned, only 2 cases of encephalitis caused by this infection have been reported [4, 5]. In one of these reports, however, the virus was not detected in the CSF and an immune-mediated mechanism of injury was postulated [4]. Therefore, in case of signs and symptoms of encephalitis in COVID-19 patients, also other causes of damage to the nervous systems should be carefully considered.",
