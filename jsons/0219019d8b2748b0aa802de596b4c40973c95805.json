Attempts to understand brain circuitry in the first two-thirds of this century were dominated by reports examining patterns of lesion-induced degeneration; indeed, much of classical neuroanatomy was built on the technique. Similarly, attempts to examine neural function have also relied on the lesion approach: the role of many regions has been inferred after their removal or isolation from the remainder of the brain. These studies, in turn, have been used to interpret the effects of human brain damage, or, in some cases, to suggest treatment regimens (e.g. Valenstein, 1986) .",

One reason is to ensure that researchers continue to appreciate the underlying assumptions upon which the methods are based. Brain lesions result in much more than a simple destruction of a discrete area: a cascade of changes emerges after the procedure. Edema and debris initially present at the lesion site can potentially affect relatively large areas of the brain. Thereafter many secondary consequences occur, resulting from disrupted vasculature, anterograde, retrograde and transneuronal degeneration, and changes in synaptic number and function as the result of factors such as sprouting, denervation supersensitivity and other forms of synaptic rebalancing (see section IIIB). These dynamic and myriad changes are often ignored by researchers examining single functional results at a particular time, despite the fact that there have been many previous reviews of the pitfalls associated with the methodology (e.g. Isaacson, 1976; Lynch, 1976; Schoenfeld and Hamilton, 1977; Steward, 1989) .",

These regions are intensely studied due to the fact that information flow is easily manipulated and relatively unidirectional. As a result, their circuitry, development and chemistry are relatively well understood. A reasonable assumption is that a lesion in these zones should simply deprive animals of that sensory modality. For example, removal of a cochlear nucleus should result in unilateral deafness or the removal of the olfactory bulbs should render animals anosmic. However, there are a wealth of other consequences of these brain lesions. Studying the range of these changes should lead to understanding \u20ac) Oxford University Press 729 of both the function of the brain regions in question and to an enhanced ability to interpret the consequences of lesion experiments in general. A second reason to review results from lesion studies periodically is to attempt to integrate the information in order to produce a more unified view of both the function of a particular area and the consequences of the lesions. Lesions of a specific brain region are done in order to test a number of different theoretical issues or to examine function from several perspectives. Often the studies are done without regard to each other, as many investigators do not look outside their own area of interest to find alternative interpretations.",

Details of actual procedures are often sketchy (or even omitted) in many of the published reports, and histological verifications of the extent of the lesions, and/or correlations of lesion size with the amount of subsequent alterations in behavior, are quite rare.

The olfactory bulbs, bilateral extensions of the rostral telencephalon which constitute ~4% of the volume of the rat brain (Cain, 1974a) , house two separate structures: the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. The main bulb receives input from the olfactory receptor cells which reside in the caudal third of the nasal cavity in the olfactory mucosa. The accessory olfactory bulb receives its afferent supply from the vomeronasal organs, tubeshaped structures found on the ventral midline of the anterior nasal cavity (Wysoscki, 1979; Halpern, 1987; Meredith, 1991) . Both regions have separate and parallel outputs. The main bulb projects via the lateral olfactory tract to the anterior olfactory nucleus, primary olfactory cortex, olfactory tubercle, entorhinal cortex, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, and anterior and posterolateral divisions of the cortical nucleus of the amygdala. The accessory olfactory bulb projects to separate regions of the amygdala: the medial nucleus and posteromedial division of the cortical nucleus (Switzer et al., 1985 and references cited therein; Price, 1987) . Therefore, bulb removal results in at least partial denervation of all of these regions.",

However, Edwards et al. (1977) compared lesions of varying size and determined that the reductions were only seen after considerable damage to retrobulbar areas. Therefore, the effect seen earlier was probably due to damage to the noradrenergic fibers coursing anterior to the genu of the corpus callosum. Edwards et al.'s (1977) paper presents an important caveat to much of the work done examining changes in central transmitter content and activity (and, indeed, the bulbectomy literature as a whole), by suggesting that lesions limited to the olfactory bulb may have a relatively small impact.",

Elevated noradrenergic turnover or transmitter levels have been found in the amygdala (Tonnaer et al., 1980; Jancsar and Leonard, 1984; Iwasaki et al., 1986) , although conflicting reports also exist (e.g. Broekkamp et al., 1986) . The affinity of a-adrenoreceptors was increased in the amygdala and hippocampus, suggesting a supersensitivity, but affinities were not altered in the cerebral cortex (Tiong and Richardson, 1990) . Higher number, but no changes in the affinity, of a 2 -adrenoreceptors, have also been reported in the homogenized forebrain (Hong et al., 1987) . Increased norepinephrine content has been reported in the primary olfactory cortex (Harvey et al., 1975) and some authors report a small increase in brainstem norepinephrine content although the finding has been inconsistent (e.g. Hirsch, 1980) .",

The fact that olfactory bulbectomy results in an inability to detect odors has been known for a long time (e.g. Swann, 1934; Brooks, 1937; Brown and Ghiselli, 1938; Allen, 1941) , and the fact has been a primary motivation for using the technique. Bilateral bulbectomy has been demonstrated to result in deficits in olfactory detection and discrimination in rats (e.g. Long and Tapp, 1970; Slotnick and Schoonover, 1984; Amemori and Bures, 1988; Whishaw and Tomie, 1989) , as well as a number of other species (e.g. salamander: Mason and Stevens, 1981; sheep: Baldwin and Meese, 1977; Bell et al., 1979; Cohen-Tannoudji et al., 1986; rabbit: Klosovskii and Kosmarskaya, 1963; kangaroo rats: Webster and Webster, 1975; pigs: Parrot et al., 1985) . However, unilateral bulbectomy apparently does not affect olfactory sensitivity (Slotnick and Schoonover, 1984) . As mentioned above, the nasal cavity contains a number of chemoreceptive detectors, including the vomeronasal organ and endings of the trigeminal nerve. Bulbectomy or partial lesions are often used to distinguish which of these neural systems underlies particular behaviors (e.g. Ladewig et al., 1980; Wysocki et al., 1982; Hart and Leedy, 1985; Meredith, 1991) or to test the possibility of olfaction mediating a particular behavior (e.g. territorial marking, Thiessen et al., 1970) . points must be addressed (e.g. Murphy, 1976; and Section IIIC) . First, due to the convoluted nasal turbinates, lavage techniques seldom destroy all receptors. This observation may explain why some studies report that olfactory receptor damage is effective in reducing sexual behavior (e.g. Powers and Winans, 1973) while others claim it does not (see above). Secondly, bulbectomy destroys both the main and accessory olfactory systems, while nasal lavage may not affect the vomeronasal organ (but see Kelche and Aron, 1984) . Thirdly, some techniques of producing peripheral anosmia can be confounded by systemic poisoning (Sieck and Baumbach, 1974) .",

However, understanding the effects of bulb removal on aggressive behavior is complicated by species and sex differences (e.g. Hilger and Rowe, 1975) , as well as the fact that many forms of aggression exist and they are not all equally affected by the surgery. For example, removal of the bulbs inhibits intermale aggressive behavior in mice (Ropartz, 1968; Rowe and Edwards, 1971; Bandler and Chi, 1972; Denenberg et al., 1973; Svare and Gandelman, 1974; DaVanzo et al., 1983; Whalen and Johnson, 1988) , guinea-pigs (Beauchamp et al., 1977) , hamsters (Hilger and Rowe, 1975; Murphy, 1976) and gerbils (Christenson et al., 1973; Rieder and Lumia, 1973; Hull et al., 1974) , presumably since the resulting anosmia makes the recognition of strangers difficult. Such an effect was not noted in sheep (Parrot and Baldwin, 1984) . Similarly, bulbectomy reduces pain-induced aggression: gentle electric shocks applied to mice housed with a novel partner elicited aggressive behavior more reliably in control animals than in bulbectomized mice (Fortuna and Gandelman, 1972) .",

Several studies have compared the effects of peripherally-induced anosmia to bulbectomy and reported that only after the latter are rats more aggressive (e.g. Alberts and Friedman, 1972; Spectorand Hull, 1972; Sieck, 1973; Cain, 1974b; Cain and Paxinos, 1974; Tiffany et al., 1979) . These studies have been used to strengthen the position that there are 'non-sensory' effects of the surgery. However, two other lines of inquiry must also be considered. First, some investigators (e.g. Murphy, 1976 , territorial aggression in hamsters) have found little difference between the two techniques. Secondly, studies designed to separate the consequences of bulb removal from damage to retrobulbar regions suggest that damage to areas caudal to the bulb is more more effective in inducing enhanced aggressiveness than lesions restricted to the bulb (e.g. Sieck, 1973; Cain, 1974a; Albert et al., 1981) .",

Once again, peripherallyinduced anosmia does not seem to affect activity (Sieck and Baumbach, 1974) , and considerable effort has been spent trying to determine the underlying changes in neurochemistry responsible (e.g. Leonard and O'Connor, 1987) . Increased activity has been interpreted as: (i) resulting from anosmia, so that animals are forced to seek more stimulation in order to gauge the nature of the novel environment; (ii) a result of a decrease in the rate of habituation in general (e.g. Cheal and Domesick, 1979) ; or (iii) as a consequence of alterations in the function of the iimbic system' areas innervated by the bulb (see Section HID).",

            "text": "Learning. It should come as no surprise that anosmic animals do poorly on tasks in which olfactory cues are salient (Herrick, 1933) . However, there are many studies suggesting that more complicated changes result from bulbectomy. Examinations of alterations in learning abilities in lesioned animals are complicated once again by the many tasks employed and species examined. For example, bulbectomized pigeons are slower to learn to peck a key for food reward than controls, but once the habit is acquired, they are no slower at learning a visual discrimination task. Bulbectomized birds were reported to be 'hesitant and inactive during early stages of training' (Wenzel and Salzman, 1968 ; see also Wenzel et al., 1969) . Bulbectomized rats trained in a visual discrimination task exhibit deficits in acquisition as well as in the final level of performance (Phillips, 1970) . Bulbectomized rats do not differ from chance in a spontaneous alternation situation, suggesting that they do not remember which arms they have previously frequented, or cannot discriminate them (Douglas et al., 1969; Klein and Brown, 1969) . They also exhibit inferior performance on passive avoidance tasks (Marks et al, 1971; Sieck, 1972; Archer et al., 1984a,b; Moutzoukis <?/ al., 1985; Thome and Rowles, 1988) . The deficits in passive avoidance behavior can be ameliorated with serotonergic agonists or antidepressants (e.g. Broekkamp et al., 1980) . Performance deficits have also been reported in tasks employing conditioned fear (King and Cairncross, 1974) and in response suppression (Thome et al., 1976) .",

For example, bulbectomized rat and rabbit pups have difficulties in locating and attaching to nipples, and thus securing sustenance, suggesting that suckling is under olfactory control (e.g. McClelland and Cowley, 1972; Singh and Tobach, 1975; Singh et al., 1976; DeSantis and DeHerrera, 1977; Rouger and Schneirla, 1977; Singh, 1977a; Tobach, 1977; Teicher et al., 1978; Hill and Almli, 1981; Distel and Hudson, 1985; Risser and Slotnick, 1987) . The fact that bulbectomy has less of an effect when performed on postnatal Day 1 than on Day 10 in rats has been used to infer that there is a changing dependence on olfactory stimulation as pups mature (e.g. Hill and AJmli, 1981) . It should be noted that as a result of its effects on nursing, early bulbectomy typically results in slow growth and lower adult body weights.",

For example, bulbectomy alters the endocrine development of female rats, resulting in delayed puberty and vaginal opening (Kling, 1964) . Male rats bulbectomized early (e.g. Day 2) exhibit copulatory deficits, while lesions at Day 10 have less of an effect (Meisel et al., 1982) . Deficits have also been reported in female hamsters, where even unilateral bulbectomy affects later reproductive behavior (Leonard, 1972) .",

For example, bulbectomy prior to parturition in primiparous mice, rats and hamsters results in an increased tendency to cannibalize pups, and decreases in nest building, pup retrieval and nursing (e.g. Gandelman et al., 1970; Zarrow et al., 1971; Goodman and Firestone, 1973; Benuck and Rowe, 1975; Marques, 1979) . However, several factors, including the amount of previous experience with pups and the physiological state of the female (cycling versus lactating) affect the results of bulbectomy (e.g. Gandelman et al., 1971; Fleming and Rosenblatt, 1974a; Pollack and Sachs, 1975; Schwartz and Rowe, 1976; Fleischer et al., 1981) . Once again, more robust effects are seen with bulbectomy than with peripherally-produced anosmia, suggesting that the effects may not be simply due to anosmia (e.g. Fleming and Rosenblatt, 1974b; Seegal and Denenberg, 1974; Benuck and Rowe, 1975) .",

The rationale for this line of research is derived from observations that a series of antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, mianserin, chloropromazine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, desipramine, fengabine; see Van Riezen and ) are capable of alleviating many of the behavioral changes seen after bulbectomy. The most commonly examined behaviors include hyperactivity in an enclosed arena, irritability, mousekilling, and passive avoidance deficits (e.g. Kumadaki et al., 1967; Ueki et al., 1972a,b; Van Riezen et al., 1977; BroekJcamp et al., 1980; Jancsar and Leonard, 1981; Noreika et al., 1981; Yoshimuraand Ueki, 1981; Archer<?r al., 1984a,b; Iwasaki et al., 1986 Iwasaki et al., , 1989 Leonard, 1986, 1988; Lloyd et al., 1987; O'Neill et al., 1987; Stockert et al., 1988; Yamamoto et al., 1989) although examinations of other consequences of bulbectomy, such as thermoregulatory deficits (Forster et al., 1980) , changes in taste aversion learning (Jancsar and Leonard, 1982) , alterations in learned immobility (Gorka et al., 1985) and circadian disturbances (Giardina and Radek, 1991) have also been employed.",

Interestingly, a similar consequence is seen after bulbectomy: only chronic administration of drugs is effective in reducing the 'olfactory bulbectomy syndrome'. Furthermore, both depressed humans and bulbectomized rats have increased plasma levels of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, a substance involved in stress-mediated immune system regulation (Arnold and Meyerson, 1990) . Similarities such as these have been used to justify using bulb removal as a screening procedure for new antidepressants (e.g. Leonard and Tuite, 1981; Van Riezen and Leonard, 1990) .",

            "text": "Many, although not all, of the antidepressants which affect bulbectomized animals are also monoamine agonists. As a result, considerable effort has been expended to examine changes in the serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems after bulb removal (see reviews cited above, section IIA2d, as well as Jancsar and Leonard, 1984; Jesberger and Richardson, 1986a,b; Tani et al., 1987; Butler and Leonard, 1990) . Observations of alterations in central monoamine levels have led to considerable speculation as to the mechanisms underlying many of the behaviors affected by bulbectomy, and to the functional relationship between the olfactory system, the 'limbic' system and brainstem arousal mechanisms. These, in turn, have been used to describe potential underlying mechanisms producing depression in humans (e.g. Leonard, 1984; Jesberger and Richardson, 1986b; Van Riezen and Leonard, 1990) . Several other neurochemical systems have also been investigated (e.g. Neuropeptide Y: Widerlov et al., 1988; GABA: Jancsar and Leonard, 1981, 1984; Lloyd et al., 1983 Lloyd et al., , 1987 . 11. Thermoregulation. Bulb removal results in an inability to maintain core temperatures when rats are placed in a cold (4\u00b0C) environment (Forster et al., 1980) , elevated body temperatures at normal temperatures and reduced water consumption in warm environments (Soderberg and Larrson, 1976) . Normal rats and mice spend a large proportion of their time contacting each other ('huddling') both for social and thermoregulatory reasons. Edwards and Roberts (1972; Edwards, 1974) reported that bulbectomy eliminates huddling in response to cold temperatures. However, as they reported that other forms of behavioral thermoregulation, such as heat seeking and overeating, are not affected, the deficit may be the result of problems in social behavior.",

Interestingly, similar results were found when bulbectomized rats were compared with animals who had undergone olfactory nerve section, a finding which suggests that changes in heart rate are due to anosmia, and not to central alterations (Phillips and Martin, 1972) . Similar changes in heart rate habituation are not observed in the goldfish (Rooney and Laming, 1984) . Kawasaki et al. (1980a,b) reported that bulbectomized rats have a lower resting heart rate, lower heart rates when placed into a novel enclosed arena, and potentiated pressor responses to posterior hypothalamic or midbrain reticular formation stimulation when compared to controls.

Similarly, few present histological data from post-mortem examinations. This oversight yields at least three problems. First, the lack of lesion verification reduces the reader's confidence that all bulb tissue was removed. As mentioned above, complete bulb removal is quite difficult (Section IB), and olfactory function can apparently be maintained with only a very small bulb remnant (e.g. Hudson and Distel, 1987; Slotnick et al., 1987) .

Furthermore, histological verification of receptor damage after lavage is as rare as that for determining the extent of bulbectomy. It is possible that a correlation might exist between functional deficits and the amount of damage done to the mucosal sheet, but observations such as these are rarely reported.",

These brain regions are involved in diffusely modulating overall brain activity. Projections to the bulb are quite dense. For example, Shipley et al.

Alternatively as has been described in several catecholaminergic populations, there might be cellular compensation through an activation of neurotransmitter synthesizing enzymes (e.g. tyrosine hydroxylase), enhanced gene expression in order to increase enzyme production in residual neurons, and augmented transmitter release and turnover (e.g. Zigmond et al., 1990) .

However, bulb removal alters synaptic relationships in many other systems (see Section IB). For example, there is a substantial cholinergic and GABAergic input from the nucleus of the diagonal band (e.g. Zaborsky et al., 1986; Woolf, 1991) , as well as efferent connections to regions thought to be involved in movement (the ventral striatum; e.g. Heimer et al., 1991) , emotions (the amygdala; e.g. Davis, 1992) and memory (the entorhinal cortex; e.g. Eichenbaum et al., 1991; Lynch and Granger, 1991) . Cell death, rebalance and sprouting could potentially occur in any of these circuits. If both secondary connections (tissue synaptically related to areas directly innervated by the bulb, e.g. the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, hypothalamic regions, hippocampus, neocortex, etc.; e.g. Switzer et al., 1985; Price et al., 1991) and retrobulbar zones potentially affected by the surgery are also considered, it becomes apparent that complex, time-dependent changes can occur as a result of bulb removal. Therefore, it seems much simpler to ascribe changes seen after bulbectomy to potential denervation effects occurring in higher brain centers than it does to posit a diffuse 'limbic' or 'non-sensory' role of the olfactory bulb.",

Furthermore, it is difficult to determine how many of the results attributed to olfactory bulb removal are really the result of damage to retrobulbar structures.

            "text": "2. Sexual behavior. It has been known for many years that the anosmia found after bilateral bulbectomy affects sexual behavior (e.g. Stone, 1922 Stone, , 1923 Beach, 1942; Whitten, 1956; Lamond, 1958; Bruce and Parrott, 1960; Murphy, 1976). Numerous studies of rodents (e.g. Heimer and Larsson, 1967; Aron et al., 1970; Moss, 1971; Edwards and Warner, 1972; Rowe and Edwards, 1972; Thompson and Edwards, 1972; Edwards and Burge, 1973; Vandenbergh, 1973; Cain and Paxinos, 1974; Larsson, 1975; Horton and Shepherd, 1979; Edwards et al., 1990) as well as other species (e.g. hamster: Murphy and Schneider, 1969; Lisk et al., 1972; Kairys et al., 1980; gerbil: Cheal and Domesick, 1979; guinea-pig: Donovan and Kopriva, 1965; cat: Aronson and Cooper, 1974; Hart and Leedy, 1983; rabbit: Franck, 1966; sheep: Lindsay, 1965; Fletcher and Lindsay, 1968; goat: Ladwewig et al., 1980; pig: Booth and Baldwin, 1983) have been reported.A number of factors influence the behavioral outcomes of the lesion, including the sex, previous sexual or hormonal experience, strain and species investigated. In some species (e.g. male hamsters: Murphy and Schneider, 1970; Doty et al., 1971; Winans and Powers, 1974; male mice: Rowe and Edwards, 1972; Rowe and Smith, 1973; male guinea-pigs: Beauchamp et al., 1977; male rats: Heimer and Larsson, 1967; Bermant and Taylor, 1969; Larsson, 1975; Meisel et al., 1982; Lumia et al., 1987; female mice: Thompson and Edwards, 1972) , bulbectomy generally results in a cessation of sexual behavior, although previous experience plays a role. In others recovery may occur (female guinea-pig: Donavan and Kopriva, 1965; Carter, 1973), the lesion may have no effect (e.g. rabbits: Brooks, 1937) or sexual behavior may be facilitated (female rats: Aron et al., 1970; Moss, 1971; Edwards and Warner, 1972; Larsson, 1977; Satli and Aron, 1977; McGinnis et al., 1978; Tyler and Gorski, 1980; Lumia et al., 1981; Antz-Vaxman and Aron, 1986a,b; Williams et al., 1991) . Furthermore, the effects of lesions vary depending on whether surgery is performed before or after puberty (e.g. Larsson, 1975; Pollak and Sachs, 1975).Some studies comparing anosmia produced by destruction of the mucosa (for example, via lavage with zinc sulfate, Alberts, 1974) to bulbectomy appear to suggest that sensory disturbances per se are not the cause of mating deficits, and implicate the functional disturbances of the central nervous system as a secondary consequence of bulbectomy (e.g. Orbach and Kling, 1966; Devor and Murphy, 1973; Edwards and Burge, 1973; Powers and Winans, 1973; Vandenburgh, 1973; Cain and Paxinos, 1974; Edwards, 1974) . Among the kinds of evidence used to support this claim is the observation that the effects of bulbectomy may be partly counteracted by arousing stimulation (e.g. shock, nocioceptive stimulation; Meisel et al., 1980; Wang and Hull, 1980).
