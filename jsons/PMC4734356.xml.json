Droplets of these fluids can be inhaled, land on broken skin, or deposit on mucus membranes in the mouth, nose, or eyes. Once there, the pathogens they carry may infect workers and cause illness. For this reason, the U.S. Health care Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) recommends that a mask and eye protection be worn \u201cduring procedures and patient care activities likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, [or] secretions\u2026.\u201d(1) However, although the requirement to wear a face shield or goggles while performing aerosol-generating procedures is well established, the need for such equipment to protect health care workers during routine care of patients with respiratory infections is the subject of debate. The current HICPAC guidelines explicitly recommend wearing a face shield or goggles during all patient care for certain illnesses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza.(1) For other infections that may be spread by respiratory aerosol droplets, HICPAC recommends wearing a face mask but states that it has \u201cno recommendation for routinely wearing eye protection (e.g., goggle or face shield), in addition to a mask, for close contact with patients who require Droplet Precautions. [This is an] unresolved issue.\u201d(1)",

            "text": "One reason for the controversy surrounding a recommendation to wear goggles or a face shield while treating patients with respiratory infections is that little is known about the potential exposure to pathogen-laden droplets from these patients and the efficacy of different types of protective measures. This is particularly true for aerosols produced during coughing, which is one of the most common symptoms of respiratory tract infections. Coughing helps clear the airways of mucus and remove excess fluids from the lungs, especially when normal mechanisms of mucociliary clearance are impaired.(2) During a cough, droplets of airway secretions can become airborne and be expelled from the mouth in a high-velocity aerosol plume. The aerosol droplets generated during coughing span a broad size range, from tens of nanometers to hundreds of micrometers, and the dispersion of these droplets in the environment depends to a large degree upon their size.(3,4) Small aerosol droplets from a coughing patient can remain airborne and spread throughout a room, and can easily be inhaled by a health care worker.(5,6)",

Although they are more bulky than goggles or safety glasses, face shields offer the advantage of guarding the entire face from contamination.(12) Some workers also may find face shields more comfortable or find that they fit better over eyeglasses or respirators. Several studies have examined face shields after use during surgeries or other aerosol-generating medical and dental procedures as a way of demonstrating that an exposure risk exists and that face shields provide protection. These studies found that many or most of the face shields worn by the health care workers had splatters of blood or other fluids and that this contamination frequently went un-noticed.(13\u201317)",

In addition, the studies all examined procedures in which significant droplet generation was expected, but none looked at potential exposure to aerosols from coughing patients with respiratory infections, about which less is known. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that health care workers consider using face shields to reduce the surface contamination of respirators.(18) However, no data have been published showing how much exterior deposition of pathogens occurs or how effectively face shields decrease it. In its 2011 report on preventing transmission of pandemic influenza, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) urged the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and other organizations to \u201cinvestigate the effectiveness of face masks and face shields in preventing transmission of viral respiratory diseases.\u201d(19)",

For some experiments, an air brush (Model 200, Badger Air-Brush Co., Franklin, Ill.) was used to produce a cough aerosol with a volume median diameter (VMD) of 8.5 \u03bcm and a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 2.9 (referred to here as the \u201clarge-particle cough aerosol\u201d). For other experiments, a micropump nebulizer (Aeroneb AG-AL7000SM, Aerogen, Galway, Ireland) was used to produce an aerosol with a VMD of 3.4 \u03bcm and a GSD of 2.3 (\u201csmall-particle cough aerosol\u201d). For both aerosol generators, the total volume of the aerosol expelled during each cough was approximately 68 \u03bcl. As described previously, the cough volume and amount of influenza virus expelled in each cough are considerably larger than those reported for human coughs.(21) This is necessary to allow detection of the airborne particles and influenza virus after the particles have dispersed in the test chamber. The cough airflow was produced by a metal bellows driven by a computer-controlled linear motor. It was based on coughs recorded from influenza patients and had a volume of 4.2 l and a peak flow rate of 11.4 liters per second (l/sec). The coughing and breathing simulators were synchronized so that each cough was initiated at the start of an inhalation by the breathing simulator.",

This aerosol included particles up to 100 \u03bcm in diameter, many of which would be expected to settle quickly after leaving the mouth (a 50-\u03bcm particle with a density of 1 g/cm2 will fall 1 m in about 13 sec). On the other hand, the long-term exposure measurements were made during the period from 1 min to 30 min after the cough, when the cough airflow had dissipated and the aerosol included mainly smaller particles that were able to remain airborne for an extended time and could flow more easily around a face shield. Consequently, using the face shield only caused a modest decrease in the inhalation of airborne particles over the long term (Figure 6). The results also indicate that the long-term exposure to the cough aerosol particles was actually somewhat higher when the breathing simulator was farther from the coughing simulator than when it was closer (183 cm vs. 46 cm). This may seem counterintuitive, especially given the results from the spray analyzer, but in fact this outcome reflects the dynamics of the movement of the cough aerosol over a longer time frame and the fact that the long-term exposure measurement does not include the first minute of the cough. When the coughing and breathing simulators are close together, the cough aerosol is concentrated in a fast-moving plume that quickly sweeps past the breathing simulator and is replaced by cleaner entrained air from the surrounding environment. On the other hand, when the coughing and breathing simulators are farther apart, the cough aerosol plume broadens and slows down before reaching the breathing simulator and thus remains in the vicinity longer. The difference in concentration decreases over time as the aerosol disperses more evenly throughout the room (Figure 4 and Figure 5).",

Second, the spray analyzer directly measures a region within the aerosol cloud, whereas the OPC draws a sample of the aerosol. Third, the spray analyzer measured the aerosol immediately after the cough, when many of the droplets were still wet, while the OPC measured particles that had time for evaporation and thus may have been smaller and more concentrated. Because of these limitations, the measurements must be compared cautiously, but they do suggest that the volume of aerosol inhaled during the first few seconds was about an order of magnitude larger than the quantity inhaled over the next 29 min.",

Similar results for the inhalation of viable influenza virus were seen with the viral plaque assays, although the lower sensitivity of the VPA relative to PCR produced results that were less conclusive. After 30 min, the amount of virus collected when a face shield was worn was reduced by 81%, which suggests that over the long term the face shield has less of a protective effect because smaller particles are able to flow around it and accumulate over time. Similarly, the face shield also was less effective against the small-particle cough aerosol; virus deposition was reduced by only 68%, again because small particles are better able to travel around the face shield and be inhaled.",

This is consistent with findings from comparing the volumes of inhaled particles with use of the spray analyzer and OPCs, as discussed earlier. Increasing the distance between the simulators to 183 cm decreased the amount of virus inhaled by 92%, and the amount of virus collected was virtually the same with or without a face shield. These results indicate that, over the longer distance, the larger particles tended to slow down and fall toward the ground before they could reach the breathing simulator, while the smaller particles were able to traverse this distance and be inhaled. Note that the influenza virus collection occurred from 0 min to 5 min after each cough, when large particles were still airborne and could be collected. On the other hand, the particle counter results discussed above covered the time from 1 min to 30 min after a cough, when the large particles were no longer airborne. This difference in large particle collection explains why the particle counter results showed an increase in particle inhalation when the distance increased, while the influenza virus results showed a decrease in virus collection when the distance increased. An examination of the amount of virus deposited on the different layers of the respirator also shows that smaller particles are better able to evade a face shield. Larger aerosol particles are more likely to deposit on the outer layer of the respirator, while smaller particles are more likely to reach the inner layers. The use of a face shield reduced the fraction of the virus that deposited in the outer layer relative to the inner layers, which suggests that the aerosol reaching the respirator had a smaller average size.",

In the large-particle cough experiments where the simulators were 46 cm apart and collection occurred for 5 min, the amount of influenza virus that was deposited on the outer mask layer was reduced by 97% when a face shield was worn. In fact, because our cough simulations were limited to aerosol particles up to 100 \u03bcm, the reduction in external contamination would likely be much greater in cases where patients were producing coughs or sneezes with larger spray droplets. For the small-particle cough aerosol, the surface contamination was reduced by 76%, again showing that face shields are most protective against larger particles.",

First, aerosol measurements of human coughs show tremendous variation from person to person in the quantity and size distribution of the aerosol particles and the amount of pathogens that are expelled.(3,22\u201325) For this reason, it is impossible to define any particular cough aerosol profile as being representative of a human cough. Although the cough simulator generates aerosol outputs that are similar to human coughs,(21) they are only two possibilities among a multitude of potential human cough aerosol expulsions, and other cough profiles may produce different results. Second, the concentration of influenza virus in the cough aerosol from the simulator is likely to be about the same for droplets of all sizes, since the virus is dispersed in the test medium. This is unlikely to be the case for human cough aerosols because pathogens such as influenza are not uniformly distributed through the respiratory tract, and this distribution probably also varies with different microorganisms.",

The bimodal distribution was consistently present in the results for all coughs; the peak at the larger particle size generally dominated during the initial part of the cough and inhalation, while the peak at the smaller size dominated later in the cough (data not shown). Until this aspect of the results is better understood, it should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, the test chamber was sealed so that no air exchange or filtration occurred during the experiments. Air filtration or exchange would be expected to reduce the long-term exposure to airborne particles, and room airflow patterns could also affect exposure.(5) Finally, these experiments were conducted with the breathing simulator and the face shield facing directly toward the coughing simulator. Although this is probably the most common situation, it is not difficult to imagine scenarios where, for example, the head of a health care worker might be tilted up or sideways, away from a supine patient, to examine a monitor or adjust an IV bag. In that case, a cough could easily enter below or from the side of the face shield and impinge more directly on the face of the worker.",

Although it is agreed that workers need respiratory protection while treating patients with certain diseases that are known to be transmitted by airborne particles, the utility of protective devices such as face shields under these conditions is less clear. Our results show that considerable exposures of workers to potentially infectious material can occur over very short time frames when they examine or treat a coughing patient at close range. The use of face shields can substantially reduce the short-term exposure of health care workers to larger infectious aerosol particles and can reduce contamination of their respirators. They are less effective against smaller particles, which can remain airborne for extended periods and can easily flow around a face shield to be inhaled. Thus, face shields can provide a useful adjunct to respiratory protection for workers caring for patients with respiratory infections. However, they cannot be used as a substitute for respiratory protection when it is needed.",
