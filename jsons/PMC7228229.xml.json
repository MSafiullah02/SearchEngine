In 2004, a case series of 12 pregnant women with SARS\u2010CoV in Hong Kong, China, reported three maternal deaths, that four of seven patients who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage, four of five patients who presented after 24 weeks had preterm birth and two mothers recovered without delivery but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by FGR9. Pregnant women with suspected/probable COVID\u201019 infection, or those with confirmed infection who are asymptomatic or recovering from mild illness, should be monitored with 2\u20134\u2010weekly ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume, with umbilical artery Doppler if necessary45.

In the event that an infected woman has spontaneous onset of labor with optimal progress, she can be allowed to deliver vaginally. Shortening the second stage by operative vaginal delivery can be considered, as active pushing while wearing a surgical mask may be difficult for the woman to achieve49. With respect to a pregnant woman without a diagnosis of COVID\u201019 infection, but who might be a silent carrier of the virus, we urge caution regarding the practice of active pushing while wearing a surgical mask, as it is unclear if there is an increased risk of exposure to any healthcare professional attending the delivery without PPE, because forceful exhalation may significantly reduce the effectiveness of a mask in preventing the spread of the virus by respiratory droplets49. Induction of labor can be considered when the cervix is favorable, but there should be a low threshold to expedite the delivery when there is fetal distress, poor progress in labor and/or deterioration in maternal condition. Septic shock, acute organ failure or fetal distress should prompt emergency Cesarean delivery (or termination, if legal, before fetal viability)45. For the protection of the medical team, water birth should be avoided. Both regional anesthesia and general anesthesia can be considered, depending on the clinical condition of the patient and after consultation with the obstetric anesthetist.For preterm cases requiring delivery, we urge caution regarding the use of antenatal steroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone) for fetal lung maturation in a critically ill patient, because this can potentially worsen the clinical condition50 and the administration of antenatal steroids would delay the delivery that is necessary for management of the patient. The use of antenatal steroids should be considered in discussion with infectious\u2010disease specialists, maternal\u2013fetal\u2010medicine subspecialists and neonatologists37, 51. In the case of an infected woman presenting with spontaneous preterm labor, tocolysis should not be used in an attempt to delay delivery in order to administer antenatal steroids.Miscarried embryos/fetuses and placentae of COVID\u201019\u2010infected pregnant women should be treated as infectious tissues and they should be disposed of appropriately; if possible, testing of these tissues for COVID\u201019 by qRT\u2010PCR should be undertaken.Regarding neonatal management of suspected, probable and confirmed cases of maternal COVID\u201019 infection, the umbilical cord should be clamped promptly and the neonate should be transferred to the resuscitation area for assessment by the attending pediatric team. There is insufficient evidence regarding whether delayed cord clamping increases the risk of infection to the newborn via direct contact51. In units in which delayed cord clamping is recommended, clinicians should consider carefully whether this practice should be continued. There is currently insufficient evidence regarding the safety of breastfeeding and the need for mother\u2013baby separation46, 52. If the mother is severely or critically ill, separation appears to be the best option, with attempts to express breastmilk in order to maintain milk production. Precautions should be taken when cleaning the breast pumps. If the patient is asymptomatic or mildly affected, breastfeeding and colocation (also called rooming\u2010in) can be considered by the mother in coordination with healthcare providers, or may be necessary if facility limitations prevent mother\u2013baby separation. Since the main concern is that the virus may be transmitted by respiratory droplets rather than breastmilk, breastfeeding mothers should ensure to wash their hands and wear a three\u2010ply surgical mask before touching the baby. In case of rooming\u2010in, the baby's cot should be kept at least 2 meters from the mother's bed, and a physical barrier such as a curtain may be used53, 54.The need to separate mothers with COVID\u201019 infection from their newborns, with the consequence that they are unable to breastfeed directly, may impede early bonding as well as establishment of lactation55. These factors will inevitably cause additional stress for mothers in the postpartum period. As well as caring for their physical wellbeing, medical teams should consider the mental wellbeing of these mothers, showing appropriate concern and providing support when needed55.\n",

However, a recent study60, including 80 321 pregnant women, reported that the rate of fever in early pregnancy was 10%, while the incidence of fetal malformation in this group was 3.7%. Among the 77 344 viable pregnancies with data collected at 16\u201329 weeks of gestation, in the 8321 pregnant women with a reported temperature > 38\u00b0C lasting 1\u20134 days in early pregnancy, compared to those without a fever in early pregnancy, the overall risk of fetal malformation was not increased (odds ratio = 0.99 (95% CI, 0.88\u20131.12))60. Previous studies have reported no evidence of congenital infection with SARS\u2010CoV61, and currently there are no data on the risk of congenital malformation when COVID\u201019 infection is acquired during the first or early second trimester of pregnancy.
