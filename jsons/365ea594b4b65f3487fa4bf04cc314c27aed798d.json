The species B viruses are divided further into two subspecies, named B1 and B2. Adenoviruses are a common cause of infections of the gastrointestinal, urinary or respiratory tract, and are isolated most frequently from young children [Schmitz et al., 1983; Gu et al., 2003; Walls et al., 2003] .",

These outbreaks usually occur in military training facilities and are characterized by respiratory tract disease with extensive morbidity (up to 80%) and occasional mortality [Gray et al., 2000; Kolavic-Gray et al., 2002; Faix et al., 2004; Lauer et al., 2004] . The serotypes causing the vast majority of outbreaks were adenovirus types 4 and 7, followed by types 3 and 21 [Gray et al., 2000; Kolavic-Gray et al., 2002] . The acute respiratory disease that was observed among those attending a military training camp in Burdur, Turkey, was probably also caused by an adenovirus. The presence of large amounts of adenovirus DNA in the sputum samples of both patients and absence of any other relevant pathogen suggests this virus to be responsible for the presumed outbreak. This assumption is reinforced by the clinical course and the accessible epidemiological data which aligns well with previous reports on adenovirus-associated acute respiratory disease in military camps [Hierholzer et al., 1974; Barraza et al., 1999; Gray et al., 1999; Hendrix et al., 1999; Kolavic-Gray et al., 2002] . The spread of the virus was favored by the fact that participants continued to attend training in spite of being sick, presumably because sick-leave might have resulted in the training being prolonged or repeated, since this type of short course military training is mandatory for male expatriate Turkish citizens who want to acquire a different nationality.",

Therefore, both patients were infected with the same virus. To allow for the determination of the viral serotype, a 1,435 bp fragment of the hexon gene was sequenced. This genome region spans seven hypervariable regions (HVR) that have been described as the genetic counterpart for antigenic epitopes that contribute to adenovirus serotype characteristics. In particular, HVRs 4, 5, and 7 have been described to be serotype specific [Takeuchi et al., 1999] . For this reason, sequencing of the HVRs has been suggested for adenovirus genotyping [Crawford-Miksza and Schnurr, 1996; Li et al., 1999; Takeuchi et al., 1999; Blasiole et al., 2004] .",

Merely, the site of isolation suggests a clinical state of respiratory disease. Compared to the adenovirus 11 prototype strain (Slobitski), our sequence showed a lower grade of homology, and also in the deduced protein sequence the virus was not identical to this strain. These differences also affected the HVRs (HVR 1, 4, 6, and 7), which queried the classification as an adenovirus 11 genotype.",

The sequence obtained, spanning more than one half of this gene, showed the highest homology to a database entry of an adenovirus 11 strain (BC34) that was isolated from a throat swab of a patient with respiratory infection and identified as an adenovirus 11a genome type [Mei and Wadell, 1993] . The homology to the adenovirus 11 Slobitski strain (Adenovirus11p) again was lower. The subdivision of adenovirus 11 into different genome types has been suggested due to the identification of three genomic clusters [Li et al., 1991] . The adenovirus 11a cluster was described to exclusively comprise viruses that were isolated from patients with respiratory disease, while viruses representing the other genome types, like the prototype strain Slobitski (Adenovirus11p), were isolated from healthy pregnant women and renal transplant recipients with infections of the urinary tract [Li et al., 1991] . A total of 25 amino acid changes in the fiber sequences of adenovirus 11a and adenovirus 11p allows a reliable differentiation of these two genomic clusters [Mei and Wadell, 1993] . Since the analyzed virus had a fiber amino acid sequence that was identical to adenovirus 11a, but differed in 16 of 193 amino acids to adenovirus 11p, it could be clearly identified as an adenovirus 11a genotype.",

To our knowledge, adenovirus 11 has been reported only once as the causative agent of acute respiratory disease in a military facility. In 1974, an atypical adenovirus 11 strain was isolated from Spanish recruits with rather mild clinical symptoms. Indeed, this virus caused only part of the outbreak, since other adenovirus serotypes and influenza virus have also been detected [Hierholzer et al., 1974] . It was identified as adenovirus 11 by serum neutralization, but surprisingly the virus failed to agglutinate monkey erythrocytes [Hierholzer et al., 1974] , which later was described to be characteristic for adenovirus 11a strains [Mei and Wadell, 1993] .
