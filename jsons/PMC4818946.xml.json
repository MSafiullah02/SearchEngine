            "text": "Dengue fever is the most common human arboviral infection globally and is responsible for more illness and deaths than any other arboviral disease.1 It is an acute mosquito-transmitted viral disease characterized by fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, rash, nausea, and vomiting. An estimated 3900 million people in 128 countries are at risk for dengue infection.2 The incidence and geographical distribution of dengue have greatly increased in recent years. Currently, it is estimated that 390 million dengue infections occur each year, with about 100 million manifesting clinically with varying degrees of severity of the disease3; a small proportion progress to severe dengue. With the growing incidence of severe dengue epidemics since the 1970s, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported cases across the Americas, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific exceeding 1.2 million in 2008 and more than 3 million in 2013, based on official data submitted by member states.4 These numbers continue to increase: 2.35 million cases of dengue were reported in the Americas alone in 2013; of this number, 37,687 were cases of severe dengue.4 The dengue virus is carried and spread by species of mosquitoes in the genus Aedes. Of these species, the primary vector is Aedes aegypti. Other Aedes species that transmit dengue include Aedes albopictus, Aedes polynesiensis, and Aedes scutellaris.",

In that year, 93% of American missionaries returning from Jamaica showed serologic evidence of recent or past infection with the Dengue Virus.5 The Dengue Virus-1 serotype was first reported in the Americas region in 1977 after an outbreak that began in Jamaica and expanded to Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela and eventually to the rest of the Caribbean countries, Mexico, Central America, and the northern countries of South America.6 A study conducted in Jamaica in 2009 found the seroprevalence of dengue immunoglobulin (Ig)G and dengue IgM antibodies to be 100% and 3.6%, respectively.7 The high seroprevalence of dengue IgG antibodies suggests that the Jamaican population might be at increased risk for dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. It was recently reported that in a 2007\u20132008 epidemic of dengue in Jamaica, 3165 tested sera showed seropositivity for dengue, leptospirosis, and malaria at rates of 38.4%, 6%, and 6.5%, respectively.8 This highlights the presence of 3 concurrent epidemics with dengue seroprevalence being the highest in the country. Between January and December 2012, the Jamaican Ministry of Health recorded 5384 clinically suspected cases of dengue fever, with 732 laboratory-confirmed cases and 10 confirmed dengue-related deaths.9\n",

However, little is known of the KAPs of Jamaicans in the control and prevention of vector-borne diseases (VBDs). Although the WHO declared Jamaica free of malaria in 1965,12 between November 6, 2006 and February 3, 2007, the Jamaican Ministry of Health confirmed 280 cases of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum on the island.13 This outbreak was brought under control in September 2007.14 In light of the recent outbreak of the Chikungunya virus leading to a declaration of a \u201cnational emergency\u201d in Jamaica, it is very important now, more than ever, to assess and address matters that are imperative to preventing future VBD outbreaks and epidemics in the country.15 The goal of this study was to assess KAPs of selected communities in western Jamaica regarding control of VBDs such as dengue and malaria.",

The knowledge scale ranged from 0 to 17 points, the attitude scale from 0 to 6 points, and the practice scale from 0 to 10 points.

Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios as well as corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Each variable was first entered separately into bivariate logistic regression models to evaluate the crude association with sociodemographic characteristics. All predictors were then entered in multivariable logistic regression to get adjusted odds ratios. Bivariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of practice score. Data were analyzed using the JMP Statistical software.",

Although the global burden of dengue is more prominent in Asia, the virus has been well documented in the Caribbean. In Jamaica, there have been several significant outbreaks of dengue fever, during which times the Ministry of Health has officially informed the Jamaican public of impending danger and put measures in place to control the spread of the diseases.9, 10, 11 However, these public awareness programs and control measures appear to be implemented only during outbreaks.",
