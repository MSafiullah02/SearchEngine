Illustrating this type was the story about a distressed patient with TB emerging from his negative pressure room without warning. HCWs sprang to action to assist the patient, but without RPE. Nearby colleagues, observing the potentially dangerous situation, quickly reminded the first responding HCWs of the urgent need to don masks. Another example of this type was a food service employee, apparently oblivious to precaution signs, walking into a patient room without the required RPE. Similarly, HCWs requested additional training for food service employees. These instances suggest the HCWs felt empowered to speak up to colleagues when safety standards were not met. This indicates a pervasive safety culture, in which following protocols is habituated. This culture is created, as we and others have found,20 through trainings, leadership addressing safety concerns, peer influence, and tangible resources like accessible equipment. HCWs appear to have the training to identify \u201cmoments of risk\u201d and feel empowered to take immediate action to mitigate them. This type of culture and HCW empowerment has been associated with robust patient safety practices.21, 22 Achieving the appropriate cultural among HCWs, however, has been shown to be challenging in hospital systems perhaps undermined, as we found, by inaccessible equipment.",

One nurse stated: \u201cI'm not gonna, you know, make that mistake again.\u201d This was attributed to, in part, experiences that HCWs had in which they had initially worn droplet protection, only to learn that the patient was later diagnosed with an airborne infection, which would require a higher level of RPE.

Some HCWs believed that their site had many high-risk patients, particularly those in larger facilities in dense urban areas. In contrast, HCWs at sites that reported that there were few high-risk patients, described plentiful, accessible equipment. Other HCWs reported the hospital not having their specified mask size or that RPEs were locked away, leading study participants to speculate that the hospital was trying to save money by limiting access to N95 use to discourage inappropriate use. Prior research has documented that HCWs in larger, more urban hospitals are at greater risk of respiratory infections, especially during outbreaks.26 The relationship between site type and risk of infections may be further complicated by risk perceptions.",

Patients coming into the ED arrive without a diagnosis, which puts HCWs at greater risk of exposure to infectious agents. Yet, perplexingly, this seems to have desensitized these HCWs. Some HCWs reported that even after an ED patient had received a diagnosis warranting use of RPE, ED staff might continue to forgo RPE, because, as one HCW noted, the staff believed they had \u201calready been exposed.\u201d HCWs working in the ED may perceive that exposure risks are omnipresent, with RPE being unable to protect from the myriad of potential exposures. This is problematic because these HCWs may habituate to not wearing RPE when protocol requires use. Other research has shown lower adherence to personal protective equipment, including N95s, among HCWs in EDs.23\n",

RPE use was also informed by perceptions of the seriousness of patient symptoms or disease. Additionally, the Health Belief Model may provide guidance for strengthening safety systems, such as providing cues to action (eg, signs, carts) to help initiate donning RPE. However, whereas the Health Belief Model was useful in developing the focus group guide, and used to guide parts of the analysis, it had limitations; our additional use of an inductive analytic approach was useful where the Health Belief Model was lacking. For example, we encountered stories around RPE availability or rapidly developing emergent situations that may have precluded HCWs\u2019 abilities to adequately process the severity and susceptibility. The Health Belief Model was originally developed with the individual in mind to understand what influenced their likelihood of getting vaccinated. This origin helps explain why it was limited for explaining HCW behavior because HCWs are enmeshed in complexities of health care facilities and systems. Workplace culture, training, resource constraints, and clinical experiences create a multilayered work context above and beyond the individual perceptions of risk, susceptibility, and threat.",

Findings related to the unique context of the ED were emergent and not part of our original study design, thus, more work needs to be done to understand ED microculture. Study participants were limited to RNs and NAs; other clinicians, staff, and patient and family perspectives were not represented. The timing of our study was unique given the Ebola outbreak and therefore increased sensitivity to RPE use. Therefore, we may have heard greater concerns about RPE availability and use.
