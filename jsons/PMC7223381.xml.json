            "text": "Local and international research has shown that counselling for women who have experienced relationships characterised by intimate partner violence (IPV) can have many positive effects. These include women gaining confidence to leave a violent/abusive relationship (Hatcher et al. 2013; Jewkes et al. 2002; Rhodes and McKenzie 1998), considering options for solving problems within the relationship, and increasing their emotional wellbeing (Iverson et al. 2016; Rhodes and McKenzie 1998). Counselling, however, may also be challenging. For example, research into a Latino community in the USA revealed that counsellors sometimes did \u201cnot consider some potentially important personal barriers to reporting\u201d, such as the victim\u2019s shame (Lewis et al. 2005, p. 81).",

The resource-related barriers include the relative lack of availability of healthcare or service provision facilities in the first place (Mbokota and Moodley 2004; Modiba et al. 2011; Njuho and Davids 2012). Other reasons include lack of adequate assistance due to problematic interactions with counsellors (Rasool Bassadien and Hochfeld 2005). That is, counsellors may sometimes view IPV as a private matter, or that it is a normal phenomenon, possibly leading to lack of action or non-interference (Rasool Bassadien and Hochfeld 2005); they may misdiagnose IPV (Joyner and Mash 2012), be afraid to intervene on behalf of the community (Lewis et al. 2005), and may not have received adequate or appropriate primary care training (noted locally, Mash et al. 2012, and globally, Watts and Mayhew 2004). In terms of social issues, some women may not report abuse due to conservative gender roles; e.g., the belief that the man is the head of the household and that his authority, and manner in which he runs the household, should not be questioned (Sugarman & Frankel 1996, cited in Jewkes et al. 2002).",

Women may either accept such violence as an everyday feature of their intimate relationships, or may see themselves as deserving of violent treatment from their partners for failing to adhere to culturally-located gendered expectations regarding their relationship roles (Kim and Motsei 2002; Wood et al. 2007). As a result, many women who experience IPV may feel that their violent partners were justified in their actions or that they did not harm them intentionally (Silverman et al. 2004). Women may also feel reluctant or ashamed about reporting IPV (Lewis et al. 2005) due to the personal, and sometimes sexual nature of the assault (Vogelman and Eagle 1991). Cultural and contextually mediated understandings of violence in intimate relationships, as well as subjective interpretations of the relative harm sustained, may also play a role. For example, anthropological research in South Africa has described violence in interpersonal relationships as being understood by those involved as a demonstration of love, depth of feeling, or emotional investment in the relationship, with women victims of IPV consequently downplaying the harm caused (Wood et al. 2008).",

Taylor and Littleton\u2019s (2006) approach focuses, inter alia, on how micro-narratives enable subject positioning (the depiction of people within particular roles and responsibilities) to take place. The interview recordings were listened to several times and the transcription read at the same time. The transcribed data were imported and coded using QSR NVIVO 10, a qualitative data analysis software program. Coding centred on the identification of micro-narratives. In the analysis, we examined common micro-narratives occurring across the interviews and at different times in the same interview, which allowed us to see patterns in the counsellors\u2019 micro-narratives. All three authors engaged with the analytical process, and the findings were presented to peers in order to refine the analysis.",

The counsellors positioned themselves as professionals who implement good counselling practices (praise, listening, confidentiality, trust); at the same time, they could not help but feel angry, burnt-out and overwhelmed. When counselling was successful, the counsellors felt positive, but there were often failures, which they reported led to anger. This anger could be viewed as the countertransference of wounded healers, who, having suffered similar abuses, simultaneously empathise with the client, feel righteous anger towards the perpetrator, and dismay at the lack of \u2018success\u2019 (Zerubavel and Wright 2012).",

Within this narrative, women who remain are regarded as victims and women who leave are considered survivors. This creates a dichotomy or an \u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 position within the counselling dynamic. The counsellor\u2019s emotional investment in the client and relationship building (such as ensuring confidentiality and thus building trust, listening attentively, displaying empathy where possible, promoting strength) was seen as worthwhile when the woman leaves the relationship (see also Lewis et al. 2005). However, the counsellors indicated becoming discouraged when the woman remained within the relationship.",

There is no guarantee that the women will be able to successfully leave their current relationship characterised by IPV, or avoid another one in the future, and the counsellors were painfully aware of this. They nevertheless held onto the narrative of \u201cbondage to deliverance\u201d or \u201cvictimhood to survivorhood\u201d as the only valid outcome of counselling. This singular narrative regarding what constitutes a \u2018successful\u2019 outcome of counselling women who have had experiences of IPV during pregnancy, does not take into account the sometimes very real structural and/or cultural obstacles that frequently prevent women from leaving relationships characterised by IPV (e.g., economic dependency on their partners for survival, or culturally-located customs and traditional practices regarding marriage bonds) (see Fleischack et al. 2017). This \u2018narrow\u2019 view of counselling outcomes may, therefore, be more likely to fail than not. Indeed counsellors\u2019 insistence on clients\u2019 adherence to patriarchal and culturally-entrenched forms of motherhood may unwittingly constitute a barrier to successfully leaving an IPV relationship, thereby undermining their own criterion for a successful outcome (that is, leaving the IPV relationship).",

The conundrums illustrated above point to a number of implications in terms of the counselling process. Firstly, to obviate counsellors feeling that their emotional investment has not been worthwhile, a useful perspective would be to see clients as complex beings: somewhere between victim and survivor, slipping between the two depending on circumstances, or as neither. This may also allow the counsellors to see and value small gains in their counselling process. Examples include: when the women come to counselling in the first place, because they feel hopeful that they can receive some assistance; valuing women having a comfortable space to share their stories to gain some insight (which also links to Moon\u2019s 2006 idea that story telling is a means to healing); and the notion of women engaging in everyday practices that serve to increase their agency and reduce the IPV, even if it involves remaining in the relationship.",

This is particularly important in circumstances where, as mentioned earlier, some women feel unable, for a range of reasons (e.g., financial, childcare), to leave the relationship. Research into IPV risk factors and reduction interventions have highlighted key risks and aspects that, if addressed, might lower the likelihood of IPV occurring. These include addressing, for example, poor relationship communication and conflict management skills (Abrahams et al. 2006; Hatcher et al. 2014), as well as economic and social empowerment initiatives (Jewkes et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2007; Pronyk et al. 2006). These all aim to alter and/or develop troubling dynamics within relationships to reduce IPV, rather than arguing that women should simply leave situations of IPV.",

Peer support as well as sensitive clinical supervision go a long way in developing growth and self-care in counsellors, as identified by Friesema (2016). Equally, though, counselling needs to be supplemented with a focus on accountability or collective responsibility for IPV in communities. This, thus, suggests the need for wider-scale interventions and advocacy.
