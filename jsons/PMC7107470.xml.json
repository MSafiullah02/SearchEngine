In total, exactly 1000 HCT recipients underwent BAL respiratory virus testing during the study period. Clinically indicated bronchoscopy for LRT symptoms and/or radiographic abnormalities was determined by a pulmonologist. A BAL was generally performed to either rule-in respiratory viral involvement of the LRT and/or to rule out alternative causes for a LRT process. The BALs were collected per institutional standard practice using up to three 30-mL aliquots of normal saline. From this cohort, we then identified subjects who had URT viral PCR testing (from nasal wash or NP swab) within 3 days or within 1 day of the BAL. Only the first BAL per subject was included in the analysis.",

Steroid dose was defined as the highest dose of steroid in milligrams/kilogram per day expressed in equivalent doses of prednisone in the 2 weeks preceding the BAL. Computed tomography of the chest obtained within 1 week of the BAL were reviewed. We chose to categorize imaging results for the presence versus absence of a solitary nodule because patients with a solitary nodule may carry an alternative diagnosis and be at lower risk for viral LRT involvement. Copathogens were defined as follows: (1) bacterial - >10 000 colony-forming units of a Gram-positive organism or any Gram-negative organism on BAL; (2) viral - any other respiratory virus detected in BAL by multiplex PCR or cytomegalovirus (CMV) shell vial positivity; and (3) fungal - positive serum or BAL galactomannan, BAL fungal PCR positivity, or BAL fungal culture positivity (excluding Candida species) [9, 10]. Alternate diagnoses included diffuse alveolar hemorrhage based on finding progressive bloody fluid return on BAL [11].",

Positive concordance was defined as both URT and LRT paired samples being positive for the same virus (P/P), and negative concordance was defined as both URT and LRT paired samples being negative for the same virus (N/N). The sensitivity and specificity for LRT detection by Ct value in the URT was plotted by generating a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The Ct value for subjects with negative testing in the URT was set at 40, above the upper limit of assay detection, to allow inclusion of these subjects in the ROC analysis. Positive and negative predictive values for LRT infection were plotted as a function of all possible Ct value cutpoints. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate odds ratios (OR) for the association between candidate risk factors and viral LRT detection. Patients with more than 1 virus detected in the URT (N = 12) were excluded from the logistic regression analysis. All patients in the cohort with LRT detection of adenovirus also had adenovirus testing of the plasma by PCR for viremia. Patients with disseminated adenovirus as evidenced by a positive plasma PCR at the time of LRT detection (N = 4) were excluded from the logistic regression and ROC analysis. Variables with P \u2264 .2 in univariable analysis were candidates for multivariable models and were retained in the models if they remained significant themselves or modified the effect of another factor (confounder). Covariates evaluated as candidate risk factors for inclusion in multivariable models are listed in Table 1. Statistical significance was defined as 2-sided P < .05. SAS version 9.4 TS1M3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all statistical analyses.",

Among the discordant pairs, 60% (25 of 42) were positive in the URT but negative in the LRT (P/N), and 40% (17 of 42) were negative in the URT but positive in the LRT (N/P). Figure 1 shows the distribution of concordance/discordance for pairs with at least 1 test positive for individual viruses. In patients who underwent BAL within 3 days of an NP aspirate, discordance between URT and LRT results was observed at the highest rate for HMPV (9 positive pairs, 33% N/P and 11% P/N), HRV (44 positive pairs, 7% N/P and 27% P/N), PIV2 (2 positive pairs, 50% N/P), and PIV3 (25 positive pairs, 12% N/P and 16% P/N) (Figure 1A). All 9 pairs with a positive adenovirus result were discordant (56% N/P and 44% P/N). Respiratory syncytial virus had the highest frequency and percentage of concordant results (13 positive pairs, 92% concordant with 8% P/N and no N/P pairs).

            "text": "Before the advent of molecular testing, a high rate of discordance was observed with rapid antigen detection assays which had a sensitivity of 15% in URT specimens and 89% in LRT specimens from immunocompromised adults [12]. Discordance between molecular diagnostic testing of URT and LRT specimens has also been reported in other studies, particularly in immunocompromised populations, where 79%\u201386% of patients with a positive LRT specimen had a concordant URT specimen [6, 13, 14]. The positive and NPVs of URT testing were 86%\u201388% and 89%\u201394%, respectively. In a different study of HCT recipients with HMPV or RSV detected in the LRT, 33% had a discordant negative test for HMPV, whereas no patients had a discordant negative test for RSV [2]. In the present study, we found high levels of discordance with 37% of sample pairs among subjects with positive testing showing discordance between URT and LRT testing for any virus. Although the sample sizes were too small for each virus to perform statistical testing, discordance rates were highest for HMPV, HRV, adenovirus, and PIV3. Of note, this discrepancy was present also among patients with URT specimens obtained within 1 day of the BAL. Human metapneumovirus LRT disease is associated with high mortality in HCT recipients, and our results suggest that a negative URT specimen may not be sufficient to rule out LRT infection [2]. We noted that adenovirus testing showed discordance in every subject with the virus. Reactivation in other tissues followed by viremia and dissemination to the lungs may have contributed to this finding. In contrast, RSV testing showed an approximately 100% concordance, suggesting that patients with RSV detected in the URT and clinical/radiographic evidence of LRT involvement may be presumed to have RSV in the LRT. These patients could be treated accordingly for RSV pneumonia and also be enrolled for clinical trials. We have previously categorized LRT infection with respiratory viruses into groups depending on viral detection in the LRT, where proven LRTI is defined as a positive LRT sample (BAL, lung biopsy, or autopsy specimen) with radiographic abnormality, probable LRTI is defined as a positive LRT sample without radiographic abnormality, and possible LRTI is defined as a positive URT sample with radiographic abnormality but no LRT sampling. We have shown that subjects with possible LRTI have outcomes more similar to URT infection for both PIV and RSV, and that subjects with proven/probable LRTI have worse outcomes including need for oxygen, oxygen-free days, and mortality [15, 16]. These results suggest that LRT testing to stratify patients into possible versus proven/probable LRTI can provide useful prognostic information in HCT recipients. This may become increasingly important because new antivirals are in development, many of which are being evaluated depending on the site of infection (upper versus lower tract). Our study included 17 patients positive for a respiratory virus in the LRT but negative in the URT. Five viruses, namely, adenovirus influenza A, PIV2, PIV3, HMPV, and HRV, had N/P discordance. Thus, proximal URT testing did not identify the LRT pathogen in these cases, including viruses that may warrant treatment with current antivirals (influenza A and adenovirus) as well as viruses for which specific antiviral therapy is being developed (PIV and HMPV).",

However, the NPV appeared to plateau such that the NPV at a Ct value of 27.5 was similar to the NPV of a negative test in the URT (90% vs 95%, respectively). It is important to note that because even a negative PCR in the URT is not fully predictive, Ct values for viruses detected in the URT cannot be used on their own to rule out LRT involvement.",

We have previously reported recipient CMV seropositivity as a risk factor for respiratory virus acquisition and progression to LRT infection after HCT [20, 21].

Cytomegalovirus seropositivity and reactivation have been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and graft-versus-host disease after HCT [23\u201325]. The pathogenesis of CMV infection and disease is complex with several immunomodulating interactions between CMV and the immune system, including effects on human leukocyte antigen expression and cytokine production (reviewed in reference [26]).

It is possible this could have been secondary to a decrease in virus detected in the URT in the later years (31% between 2009 and 2011, 24% between 2012 and 2013, and 17% between 2014 and 2016) because a negative result in the URT was strongly associated with a lower risk for LRT detection. This reduction in URT respiratory viral detection may also have been secondary to improvements in infection control practices. Alternatively, the trend towards reduced risk of LRT detection in later years may be a reflection of practice changes either with (1) delaying transplants in patients with positive testing for respiratory viruses in the URT or (2) fewer bronchoscopies being performed now compared to in the past [27]. This could have led to a sampling bias in more recent years in which a bronchoscopy was more often performed when lung disease due to an alternative, nonrespiratory viral, process was suspected.",

There was no significant difference between viral loads in the upper versus lower tract when analyzing all viruses together in patients with a BAL within 3 days or 1 day of URT testing. One argument against early bronchoscopy to test for viral LRT involvement includes the notion that viruses in the URT may be \u201cpushed\u201d into the LRT during the procedure itself. Lower respiratory tract positivity could also simply reflect upper tract secretions that are aspirated during the procedure, similar to the finding of oral flora in bacterial cultures of a BAL. The finding of several cases of positive testing in the nose yet negative testing in the lungs argues against the \u201cpushing down\u201d of viruses from the URT to the LRT during bronchoscopy and against the detection of viruses in the LRT as an artifact of contamination from the URT during bronchoscopy.

First, even though our sample size was relatively larger than other studies of immunocompromised patients with paired URT and LRT sampling, we could not evaluate risk factors for discordance for individual viruses. Second, data were collected retrospectively, and, therefore, need for sampling of the URT and LRT was determined by the clinician. The patient population was limited to those who underwent BAL within 1 or 3 days of an NP aspirate because viral detection in the LRT was an outcome measure, and therefore risk factors may differ with patients who undergo only URT testing. Third, our primary analysis focused on HCT recipients who had undergone BAL within 3 days from an NP aspirate. This could be considered too long a time period. More important, however, the results from this analysis were similar to that for patients who had undergone BAL within 1 day of an NP aspirate. Fourth, differences in sampling from the LRT by BAL and URT by swabbing may contribute to differences in Ct values. The higher collection volume for BALs compared with NP aspirates (approximately 30 vs 5 mL) would generally lead to higher Ct values in LRT specimens due to greater dilution. Fifth, antiviral therapy in patients with influenza or RSV detected in NP aspirates may have affected the detection of these viruses in the BAL. However, we found that almost every case of RSV infection was concordant and only 1 case of influenza was discordant P/N. Sixth, because copathogens and alternative diagnoses were identified in many patients, we cannot definitively conclude whether LRT symptoms, signs, or radiographic abnormalities were caused specifically by the respiratory virus, the copathogen, and/or a concomitant noninfectious process. Finally, Ct values may not be as generalizable between different assays compared with a true viral load measured in copies/milliliter. Even though most currently available commercial PCR assays do not include Ct values, our study shows the predictive value of these results for LRT infection.",
