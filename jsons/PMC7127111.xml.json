            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious disease that results in death in a great portion of patients (Drosten et al., 2004). SARS is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which is detectable in respiratory secretions of patients after infection (Fouchier et al., 2003). This disease is highly contagious and still has the potential to cause a very large-scale epidemic in the future in the absence of a vaccine or effective therapeutic drugs (Wang et al., 2004). The key to preventing and controlling a future outbreak of SARS is to block transmissions of infection through a strict quarantine policy. Therefore, a rapid, sensitive, specific, and accurate diagnostic method is essential so that suspected patients can be correctly assessed (Jiang et al., 2004, Che et al., 2004). Currently, there are several diagnostic methods used for the detection of SARS. The first option is based on nucleic acid detection. Since the genome of SARS-CoV has been sequenced completely (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most common method that is used to detect the SARS-CoV during the early phase immediately after the onset of clinical symptoms (Hourfar et al., 2004, Louie et al., 2006, Petrich et al., 2006). However, the RT-PCR assay is probably not sensitive enough to detect SARS-CoV in secretions or serum until 3 days after the onset of symptoms (Yam et al., 2003). Statistically, about half of SARS patients cannot be identified at an early stage based on viral RNA detection (Li et al., 2005). Besides, the RT-PCR tests require not only a thermal cycler for conventional PCR or a more complicated machine for real-time PCR (Liu et al., 2005), but also a specific laboratory with expertise in molecular diagnostics to confirm SARS in the acute phase (Drosten et al., 2004, Che et al., 2004, Fujimoto et al., 2008). Unfortunately, other sequence based methods such as a real-time loop-mediated amplification assay (Poon et al., 2004, Poon et al., 2005, Hong et al., 2004), a gold film with enzymatic electrochemical genosensor (Abad-Valle et al., 2005) and a rolling circle amplification PCR-based assay (Wang et al., 2005) exhibit lower sensitivity than the RT-PCR method. Serological testing is another diagnostic option. However, serological tests have shown a relatively low sensitivity of only 65.4% using sera obtained 6\u201310 days after the onset of symptoms (Shi et al., 2004). The third option is based on detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV after infection (Peiris et al., 2003a). However, the antibody response in more than 93% of SARS patients takes at least 10\u201328 days to develop after symptoms onset, so this approach is not a good method for early detection (Peiris et al., 2003b). The final possible approach is to detect specific SARS-CoV antigens such as the spike protein (Zhao et al., 2005, Haynes et al., 2007, Manopo et al., 2005) and particularly the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein is one of the early expressed proteins and should have diagnostic value. In the serum of SARS patients, it has been shown that N protein can be detected as early as 1 day after infection (Che et al., 2004). Thus, detection of SARS-CoV N proteins is a valuable approach to diagnose and monitor disease activity and makes it possible to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic method at an early stage. In addition, one significant advantage of detecting SARS-CoV N protein in serum is to eliminate the risk of infection while collecting nasopharyngeal aspirates (Che et al., 2004). Among several possible methods are available for the detection of SARS-CoV N protein, conventional antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most widely used method (Chen et al., 2005, Chan et al., 2005, Qiu et al., 2005). Yet another method of detecting SARS-CoV N protein is based on an immunofluorescence assay, which was able to detect SARS-CoV from SARS patients as early as 2 days after the onset of symptoms (Liu et al., 2005). Recently, Professor Okamoto and his co-workers proposed a highly sensitive immunoassay based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using chemiluminescence (CLEIA) for the detection of SARS-CoV N protein and this method has pushed the detection limit to 1.56 pg/mL (Fujimoto et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Recently, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been introduced into biosensing and proved to be one of the most efficient ways to increase the detection limit of biosensors (Manso et al., 2008, Cui et al., 2008). It is well known that GNPs possess special optical properties such as localized surface plasmons (LSPs) which result in wavelength selective absorption with extremely large molar extinction coefficients and significant enhancement of the localized electromagnetic field close to the GNP surface within 50\u201360 nm (Mock et al., 2003, Sonnichsen et al., 2002, McFarland and Van Duyne, 2003). Based on the property of localized surface plasmon coupled fluorescence (LSPCF) combined with the sandwich immunoassay, a novel fiber-optic biosensor has been proposed by our group to study protein\u2013protein interactions. Experimentally, the detection limit of LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor has been demonstrated to be as low as 1 pg/mL when detecting mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) interacting with anti-mouse IgG (Hsieh et al., 2007). In addition, we have also demonstrated that the LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor is able to measure alpha-fetoprotein in human serum as low as 0.1 ng/mL (Chang et al., 2009). In this report, the LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor is applied to enhance the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV N protein in diluted serum to a limit of 0.1 pg/mL. Clearly, the biosensor has significant potential for the early detection of clinical SARS-CoV infection.",

The next step was to establish an antigen-capture system for SARS-CoV that would allow the concentration of GST-N protein to be determined by ELISA. Since the monoclonal antibodies were both derived from mouse, it is not possible to use them as the capture and detection antibodies because the secondary anti-mouse IgG will bind to both murine antibodies. Therefore, we immobilized both anti-N-1 and anti-N-2 antibodies on ELISA plates as the capture antibodies for the GST-N protein and used rabbit polyclonal anti-GST-N antibodies as the detection antibody.

The concentrations of GST-N protein at 0 pg/mL, 0.1 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, 10 pg/mL, 100 pg/mL, and 1 ng/mL were tested separately. When a fixed concentration of LSPCF probes was injected into the reaction chamber, a great number of LSPCF probes migrated into the interaction region of the evanescent field near fiber core surface. Consequently, a rapid increase in fluorescence intensity at the beginning of the assay is observed. However, not all LSPCF probes in the interaction region bind to GST-N proteins (target antigens) which are captured by the immobilized anti-N-1 antibodies (capture antibodies) on the fiber core surface. In these circumstances, the LSPCF probes that are not associated with the antigens diffuse out of the interaction region of the evanescent field such that the fluorescence intensity decreases sharply. In addition, when LSPCF probes are injected into the reaction chamber, this induces the disturbance that results in decreasing of fluorescence signal in the measurement. Finally the signal reaches equilibrium as shown in Fig. 2A. The SNR in this experiment was better than 9 at different concentrations of GST-N protein in PBS if the PBS group is treated as a zero concentration solution (0 pg/mL of GST-N protein) to define background noise. The fluorescence signal is calculated by subtracting the background level from the detected fluorescence intensity in this experiment. The detected fluorescence intensity was obtained by averaging the signal over the last fifty data points for each concentration measurement. The standard deviation of the detected fluorescence intensity is equal to the noise level. The unit of fluorescence intensity is an arbitrary unit (a.u.) defined by the detected fluorescence intensity normalized against the intensity of the laser beam. In these conditions, it was possible to obtain a linear relationship between the fluorescence signal and GST-N protein concentration over the range from 0.1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL as shown in Fig. 2B clearly. The correlation coefficient (R\n2) is 0.9469 and the error bar is equal to one standard deviation.",

Using conventional antigen capture ELISA, GST-N protein was detectable at a concentration as low as 15 ng/mL in PBS or 1 ng/mL in diluted serum. In order to enhance the detection sensitivity, a highly sensitive LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor was used. The lowest detectable concentration in PBS was verified experimentally to be 0.1 pg/mL. Furthermore, the detection limit in 10-fold diluted human serum was 0.1 pg/mL, which is equivalent to 1 pg/mL in undiluted serum. In other studies using conventional ELISA, the detection limits for recombinant SARS-CoV N protein were stated to be 37.5 (He et al., 2005), 50 (Che et al., 2004), 200 (Lau et al., 2004), and 1000 pg/mL (Shang et al., 2005). Only the CLEIA based system which detects protein levels as low as 1.56 pg/mL of recombinant SARS-CoV N protein (Fujimoto et al., 2008), is comparable to our method. However, CLEIA requires tedious washing steps and is relatively prone to methodological variations. Although our conventional ELISA system is not as sensitive as those methods presented in other reports, our developed LSPCF platform improves sensitivity up to at least 104-fold using the same monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, in terms of detection limit and cost effectiveness, the LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor becomes one of the best methods for SARS-CoV N protein detection in human serum. Furthermore, the LSPCF system has a great potential to become a high throughput chip-based assay in the measurement of serum protein levels qualitatively and quantitatively.",

            "text": "The ultra low detection limit of LSPCF fiber-optic biosensors is based on several properties. Firstly, the LSPs excite and enhance fluorescence with high efficiency near the GNP surface. Secondly, the fluorescence is amplified because more than 40 fluorophores are presented on each fluorescence probe and excited simultaneously. Thirdly, on the fluorescence probe, the protein A which is immobilized on the GNP surface, acts not only as a linker by connecting to the secondary antibody labeled fluorophore but also as a spacer that avoids metal-induced quenching effects effectively (Hsieh et al., 2007). Fourthly, the fluorescence signal is detected at the distal end of the optical fiber in a conventional setup. In such situations, the coaxial propagation of the pumping laser beam induces a strong background signal, which results in a lower detection limit apparently. In contrast, the LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor detects the fluorescence signals close to the reaction region (Hsieh et al., 2007, Chang et al., 2009). It results in a significant increase in the fluorescence collection efficiency compared with the conventional setup (Chang et al., 1996). Finally, the sandwich immunoassay configuration in the LSPCF biosensor exhibits better specificity than other types of immunoassays such as direct labeling and single-capture (Kingsmore, 2006). The LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor has many useful features such as ease of operation and disposability. In addition, based on the ultra high detection sensitivity and quantitative ability, this biosensor can be used for the early diagnosis of diseases in clinics.",

This level is very suitable for application to the clinical diagnosis at the early stage of SARS patients. Importantly, a linear response between the fluorescence signal and the concentration of GST-N protein was obtained for a range from 0.1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL. In comparison with conventional antigen capture ELISA, the detection limit of the LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor for GST-N protein has been shown to be increased by 104-fold using the same monoclonal antibodies. Finally, the linear relationship between the concentration of GST-N protein in diluted serum and fluorescence signal indicates that the LSPCF biosensor, when used for the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection, should be able to work well at a very early stage of infection among SARS patients.",
