Humidity alters the evaporation rate of the droplets and therefore affects droplets\u2019 size. Knight estimated the time taken for particles to fall to the floor in a 3-m height room. Particles of 1\u20133 \u03bcm in diameter remain suspended almost indefinitely, 10\u2013\u03bcm droplets stay in the air 17 min, 20-\u03bcm droplets remain for 4 min, and 100-\u03bcm droplets fall to the ground after 10 s [2]. The droplet size thus affects how airflow patterns distribute their deposition. Temperature changes also greatly influence the exchange flows between rooms. Both temperature and humidity affect the lipid envelope and protein coat, affecting the period of survival. Temperatures above about 24 \u00b0C appear universally to decrease airborne bacterial survival. Transport of such airborne droplets is driven by various other environmental factors, such as the local ventilation airflow (windows, doors, ventilation systems), the movement of people and their clothing, and thermal and airflow gradients produced by various pieces of equipment.",

            "text": "Another important consideration for the pathogenesis of aerosolized transmitted infectious diseases is the penetration and deposition of these infected particles in the respiratory tract. Particles >20 \u03bcm rarely penetrate below the trachea, particles 5\u201310 \u03bcm have 50 % penetration of the tracheobronchial tree, and particles <5 \u03bcm have less penetration of the alveolar region (30 %) [3]. Receptors are required for some infectious agents to initiate successful infection and eventually disease. Whereas bacteria and fungi can exist independently of host cells, viruses require specific receptors to which they can bind before entering and replicating within particular host cells. This requirement has been offered as one of the explanations for why certain individuals were infected with avian influenza A (H5N1) and perhaps why others were not. Differing receptor distribution patterns in the upper and lower respiratory tracts among individuals can affect the ease with which inhaled airborne viruses can cause infection and disease [4, 5]. Finally, the nature of the infecting agent and the human respiratory activity itself may cause a different variety of organism to be expelled with differing effects on secondary cases. The physiology of a cough suggests that it is more likely to bring up and expel deep-seated organisms from the lower respiratory tract (e.g., influenza, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacterial species)than the sneeze or normal speech, both of which are more likely to expel organisms inhabiting the upper respiratory tract(e.g., rhinoviruses and coronaviruses).",

The infectious dose varies among individual pathogens and their hosts. Not only are immunocompromised hosts more susceptible to infection, even with low infectious doses they become more effective source spreaders because the pathogen is poorly controlled, leading to super-spreading events. Knowledge of the infectious dose can help estimate the number of air changes required in an indoor environment to reduce the pathogen concentration to a safe level.\n",

Minimal survival for both lipid and nonlipid membrane viruses occurs at intermediate RH (40\u201370 %) [7]. Data on human corona virus 229E indicate a half-life of 3 h at 80 % RH, 67 h at 50 % RH, and 27 h at 30 % RH, suggesting that if confronted with a coronavirus epidemic the room RH should be kept high (\u226580 %) [8].
