Clinical signs appeared insidiously over 2\u20133 days, beginning in the pelvic limbs and progressing to involve all limbs and rendering the cat non-ambulatory, before stabilising the following week. The cat was examined 8 days after becoming unable to walk. The cat had had a similar episode at 6 months of age; at that time, motor function improved significantly over 2\u20133 weeks and took 3 months to return to normality. The cat was vaccinated as a kitten, but not since, and lived exclusively indoors.",

Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were markedly reduced in amplitude for all the tested nerves (\nFig 2 and Table 1) (Malik and Ho 1989). Temporal dispersion of the CMAP was found in the tibial and peroneal nerves and the peroneal CMAP was polyphasic (Fig 2). Motor nerve conduction in the tibial, peroneal and ulnar nerves was at the lower end of the expected range compared to normal values in cats (Table 1) (Malik and Ho 1989). Conduction block was found in the ulnar nerve, as evidenced by finding a proximal/distal CMAP amplitude ratio of 0.4 with a change in duration of 7%. The sensory wave of the peroneal nerve was easily recorded and of normal conduction velocity (Table 1) (Redding and Ingram 1984).",

It adds to the literature a detailed neurological description of a polyradiculoneuropathy in a cat, thus aiding other veterinarians in recognising this disease. This report also adds new information about the natural course of the disease as this case showed three reversible episodes of subacute tetraparesis within 1 year (Gerritsen et al 1996). Finally, very specific electrophysiological tests such as the study of late potentials (F wave) and the sensory potentials have been conducted in our case. The recording of those potentials is usually more difficult than motor potentials because the amplitude of the waves is in the range of the microvolts (mV).",

This clinical picture is very similar to the acute IP described in dogs and Guillan\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) in humans (Cuddon, 1998, Hughes and Cornblath, 2005). In many animals affected by peripheral nerve diseases, the myotatic reflexes (as the patellar reflex) are preserved, whilst flexor reflexes become notably depressed, as in the case reported here. It has been proposed in human medicine, that the myotatic reflexes may be useful for the distinction between axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy (patients with demyelinating disease have a significantly greater loss of their myotatic reflexes) (van Dijk et al 1999). In our case, the electrodiagnostic results were more indicative of an axonal type polyradiculoneuropathy, which may account for the preservation of the patellar reflexes. In previously described cats, the patellar reflex was recorded as absent in all the cases and post-mortem examination of two of the cases revealed a mixed involvement of the axons and the myelin (Gerritsen et al 1996).",

If the disease affects only the nerve roots, the histopathological diagnosis from the peripheral nerve is frequently non-specific and no help in the diagnosis (Gerritsen et al 1996). Therefore, electrodiagnostic tests, which are minimally invasive, are of far greater value. The electrodiagnostic findings obtained on the presented cat were very similar to those reported in dogs and in acute motor axonal neuropathy in humans, which is one of the three main subtypes of GBS (Cuddon, 1998, Hughes and Cornblath, 2005). In our case, abnormal spontaneous electrical activity recorded in the muscles, combined with decreased amplitude of the CMAP suggest axonal loss. The nerve conduction velocities, which reflect the integrity of the myelin sheath of the peripheral nerves, were only moderately reduced. Those findings, therefore, demonstrate a balance towards greater axonal than demyelinating lesions.",

The sensory potentials are usually easily recorded and have normal conduction velocity (Cuddon 1998), as obtained in the presented case for the sensory potential of the peroneal nerve. The study of the late potential (F wave) provides definitive evidence of the involvement of the nerve roots. The F wave represents a purely motor event and is a means of assessing the ventral nerve root (motor). In peripheral nerve diseases, the F wave latency is increased, as observed in our case. To assess the relative distribution of nerve pathological findings (proximal versus distal versus equal distribution), the F ratio can be used. The F ratio is obtained with a specific formula that basically divides the latency of the F wave by the latency of the M wave. If the ratio is greater than the reference value, it indicates more severe involvement of the proximal segment of the nerve, as demonstrated in our case.",

In previous reports in cats, the initial neurological progression reached a peak at 3 days, with spontaneous remission within 4\u20136 weeks, which is a very similar course to our cat (Gerritsen et al 1996). In the series of Gerritsen et al (1996), seven out of nine cats recovered completely. Relapses can occur in dogs but occur more rarely in cats (Gerritsen et al 1996). A chronic relapsing polyradiculoneuritis has been described in a cat presenting abnormal high stepping gait, ataxia, muscle twitching and loss of sensory perception interrupted by several episodes of temporary remission. This condition differs from our case where the motor function was primarily affected (Flecknell and Lucke 1978). During the recovery period, support to eat and drink, manual expression of the bladder and prevention of pressure sores are required. Respiratory complications can also be seen in this condition and should be monitored during the recovery period.",

The clinical signs are not characteristics but refer to a generalised neuromuscular disease. Electrodiagnostic tests help to precisely localise the lesion, although it does not provide an aetiological diagnosis. Thus, the diagnosis is based on combining the results of the neurological examination, the electrophysiological findings, and possibly the history of a recurrent disease. This disease should be recognised by veterinarians as it exhibits a marked discrepancy between the severity of the clinical signs and the overall good prognosis, although the early prognosis may be guarded because of possible respiratory failure. Because complete recovery is expected, it is of major importance for the animal to base the prognosis on the combination of the electrodiagnostic findings and natural evolution of the disease and not on the initial dramatic neurological signs.",
