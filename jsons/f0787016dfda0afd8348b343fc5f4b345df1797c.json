            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that causes a highly contagious Corona Virus Disease (COVID19). Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S-protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently, COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences to explain these population-level differences. One of the key factors of entry of the virus in host cells presumably is because of differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that a higher expression of ACE2 is facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), with different frequencies in different populations. We suggest that high expression of ACE2 results in homo-dimerization, proving disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2; whereas, the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of the Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest that several key host genes, like SLC6A19, ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, might have a critical role. To conclude, understanding population specific differences in these genes may help in developing appropriate management strategies for COVID19 with better therapeutic interventions.",

SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be originated in bats and transmitted to humans via unknown intermediate host. However, its origin is still being questioned time and again. With the declaration of SARS-CoV-2 as pandemic by WHO, extensive research worldwide has been carried out. It has been established that Human ACE2 mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells through its Spike (S) Protein, which primarily makes entry to host body through respiratory tract with nasal epithelial cells as potential initial infection site (Sungnak et al., 2020) . ACE2 is a functional receptor on human cells for this newly originated coronavirus (Walls et al., 2020) with a higher affinity than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) originated in . However, no substantial evidence exists about the higher expression of ACE2 being primarily associated with the degree of infection (Kuster et al., 2020) . Additionally, COVID19 lethality is mostly driven by the extent of underlying lung injury; whereas, a negative correlation has been reported between ACE2 expression and lung injury (Imai et al., 2005) . A recent report also suggests an inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by human recombinant soluble (hrs) ACE2 (Monteil et al., 2020) , making it an interesting question to explore.",

This leads one to hypothesize about differential genetic susceptibility to COVID19 and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations (Kaiser, 2020) . Efforts are being made to gain a better understanding of this disease and even propose prophylactic-hypothetical role of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine, a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis (TB), for reduced morbidity and mortality for COVID19 in human population (Miller et al., 2020) . Due to extensive contemporary research, evidences in favour (Stawiski et al., 2020) as well as against (Cao et al., 2020) the existence of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein bindingresistant ACE2 natural variants, in different populations, have been found recently. In addition, studies highlighting role of eQTLs in ACE2 expression, resulting in potential differential COVID19 fatality (Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020a) , are pouring in. Where most such studies are targeting only natural variations in ACE2 gene as SARS-CoV-2 differential susceptibility factor, recent evidences suggest that additional host proteins like cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 act as co-factors and are critical for efficient cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Further, it is equally important to consider that rare functional variants, with uncertain consequences, may not explain large-scale population level differential clinical outcomes.",

We used network theoretical concepts, namely probability of degree distribution, clustering coefficient and average neighborhood connectivity, to characterize the structural and organizational features of the network (Details in supplementary Information). Removal of high degree nodes (hubs) in biological networks may cause lethality to the corresponding organism; the phenomenon has been referred to as the centrality-lethality rule (Jeong et al., 2001) , verified by various genomic investigations. This idea of understanding enabled us to determine the topological features of the network architecture, important functionally related modules and hubs (Malik et al., 2019; Nafis et al., 2016) . The topological properties were calculated after each subsequent removal, using the Network Analyzer plugin in Cytoscape version 3.7.1. The calculated topological properties of knock-out experiment were compared with those of the main network and the change in the properties helped in understanding the role of leading hubs in the network.",

            "text": "Mapping these residues on the recently resolved structure (61M7.pdb) suggests that this region lies in symmetric dimerization interface between ACE2 homodimer; and is also masked from outside by two BoAT1 in an overall 1:2:1 hetero-tetramer of B0AT1 and ACE2 ( Figure S1a ) (Yan and Zhang, 2020) . In a recently reported study, the overexpression of ACE2 has been reported to have an overall protective role in viral infection among patients (Vaduganathan et al., 2020) . Increased density of ACE2 on the cell surface has been observed to protect from lung injury (Imai et al., 2005) ; also observed in many other instances (Kuster et al., 2020) . We propose that an increased expression of ACE2 due to various factors, including naturally occurring variations influencing expression of the gene, may increase collisions and hence result in homo-dimerization of this protein. Binding of B0AT1 to ACE2 is not dependent on ACE2 homodimerization, but its presence along with dimerised ACE2 effectively shields the latter from interaction with TMPRSS2, with a possible prevention or reduction in its efficiency to cleave ACE2, a hypothesis based on visualization of the available experimentally resolved structure 61M7.PDB (Yan and Zhang, 2020) . This observation is significant since the cleaved ACE2 interacts more efficiently with the SARS CoV-2 RBD domain.",

In the absence of any experimentally resolved structure available in literature with ACE2 homodimer and complete SARS-CoV2 Spike Glycoproteins binding to these, we aligned the RBD domains of the 6M17.pdb with the prefusion SARS-CoV2 Spike Glycoprotein in the optimal ACE2 binding conformation (Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan and Zhang, 2020) with \"up CTD1\" and \"open S1 subunit\" (Song et al., 2018) (Figure 1') . Both Spike Glycoproteins (6VSB.pdb) aligned well with viral RBD of (6M17.pdb). Further these were also observed without any steric clash with the ACE2 or partner Spike Glycoprotein in modelled structure. Both of these protruded radially outward from ACE2 binding site at PDs but inwards, at anchorage sites on virus membrane, with distance of approximately 27 nanometers (nm) (Figure 1') . However, considering the reported inter spike distance, between 13-15 nm (Neuman et al., 2006) and relative positions of Spike proteins on the viral shell, given almost similar sizes of SARS-CoV (Goldsmith et al., 2004; Neuman et al., 2006) and SARS-CoV-2 (Chen et al., 2020b) , these are anticipated to be either parallel or protruding radially outwards from its anchorage site, contrasting to the findings in modelled structure (Figure 1 ). With this finding of inverse orientation of the Spike protein from virus shell in modelled structure, we propose that in case of ACE2 dimerization, only one of the dimerized ACE2 can bind with the Spike protein due to steric hinderances. Thus, the other unbound ACE2 partner may participate in its physiological role and continue to protect from lung injury.",

From the RMSF analysis of the simulated trajectories, we observed a higher order fluctuation in monomeric ACE2 homo-dimerization interface; while the rest of the ACE2 displayed a similar fluctuation profile, including residues interacting with RBD ( Figure This observation further explains the protective role of overexpressed ACE2, resulting in its dimerization and reduced affinity for the RBD domain of SARS CoV-2 S1 protein. However, we are also not clear whether the presence of B0AT1 has any allosteric effect on this observation, in addition to already observed masking of ACE2 from TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage. Additionally, another metalloprotease ADAM17 has been reported to compete with the TMPRSS2 and cleave ACE2 in a way that only cleavage by TMPRSS2 was reported to drive the SARS CoV entry inside the cell (Heurich et al., 2014) , which is yet to be explored in relation to 8 SARS CoV-2. Recent literature also indicates the potential role of other proteases, like cathepsin B/L that can functionally replace TMPRSS2, which needs to be evaluated extensively. (Sungnak et al., 2020) All these hypotheses warrant further in-silico analyses with better computational resources, as well as experimental study designs; and for these we are open to seek collaborations.",

HaploReg annotations indicated Enhancer histone marks and DNAase activity in the regions overlapping these SNPs. Amongst these, rs4818239 showed a prominent putative functional role ( Figure S9b ) which requires experimental validation. However, the frequency distribution of the variant rs4818239 in different populations groups of 1000G showed an interesting differential pattern (Figure S9c) . We also explored if there were any alternate functional variations, yet common in populations, by screening TMPRSS2 gene through genomAD browser and filtered for only missense variations. The search returned rs75603675 (NP_001128571.1:p.Gly8Val or G8V) and rs12329760 (NP_001128571.1:p.Val197Met or V197M), also observed with differential frequency distribution in 1000G populations (Figure S9d and e) .

SRCR (GO Term: Scavenger Receptor Activity as annotated in UniProt) and introduces an amino acid with different properties, which could disturb this domain and abolish its function. Analyses of another variation rs75603675 (p.Gly8Val or G8V) showed that wild-type residue, glycine, providing flexibility might be necessary for the protein function and an alteration in this position could abolish this function, as the observed torsion angles for this residue were unusual. It could be speculated that only glycine was flexible enough to make these torsion angles, and a change at the location into another residue would force the local backbone into an incorrect conformation, disturbing the local structure. The variant residue was also observed to be more hydrophobic than the wild-type residue. Since sequence similarity search did not find any significant template at the N-terminal of this protein, we could not generate a quality model for isoform-2, which contains G8V variation; hence we carried out sequence-based stability analysis. The results suggested that G8V variation could increase the stability of the TMPRSS2 protein with \u2206\u2206G value of -0.10 kcal/mol. Further, it is known that Arginine and lysine residues within amino acids 697 to 716 are essential for efficient ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2 (Heurich et al., 2014) and recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S-protein priming. Based on information from previous studies, we docked the TMPRSS2 p.Val197Met wild-type and variant protein with ACE2 and S-protein of SARS-CoV-2. The docking results suggest that the variant V197M protein could promote the binding to ACE2 and inhibit the binding with S-protein ( Figure S11) . However, these observations need critical revaluation as well as experimental work to understand these interactions better.",

As its expression was observed to be very low in Lungs, we resolved to look for indirect signatures that may have putative role in providing differential susceptibility. We noticed several variations clustering together in a potential enhancer region (Figure S12d and e) and with differential frequencies in different populations. eQTL analyses at GTEx portal also showed a huge list of potential SNPs upregulating or down regulating SLC6A19 expression in Pancreas, liver, and whole blood cells, overlapping with potential Transcription factor binding sites ( Figure S12f) .

The probability of degree distribution (P(k)), Clustering coefficient (C(k)) and Neighbourhood connectivity (CN(k)) showed that the HPIN followed a power law scaling behavior. The power law behaviour was also checked and confirmed by using statistical test for power law fitting (p-value \u2265 0.1) (Clauset et al., 2009) in the hub-removal process. The removal of RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA & BTF3 from the HPIN brings significant variations in the topological properties of the HPIN where, degree distribution (\u03b1 and \u03b2) change significantly (Figure S14a) . Similarly, the variations in the measurements of the exponents of clustering coefficient and neighbourhood connectivity (\u03bb and \u00b5) also showed significant ( Figure   S14a ). The knockout experiment of hub could able to highlight the local perturbations driven by these hubs and their effect on global network properties. The result suggest removal of NACA and RPS6 hubs could turn down the degree distribution, so it could be crucial for communicating the signals (Figure S14b) . In case of clustering coefficient, perturbation of BFT3 shows minimum \u03b3, indicating removal of BFT3 makes the network less compact, which may lead to the delay in flow of signal. The HPIN perturbation increases in case of BTF3 hub removal. In Neighbourhood connectivity increase in \u00b5 indicates that the information processing in the network becomes faster when SUMO1 hubs are removed, which means that local perturbations due to removal of hubs are strong enough to cause significant change in global scenario (Canright and Eng\u00f8-Monsen, 2004) ( Figure S14b ).

The higher expression of ACE2 facilitates homo-dimerization resulting in hindrance to TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2. It becomes more difficult in presence of B0AT1 that usually does not express in Lungs. We also propose that the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, natural variations in TMPRSS2, with potential functional role, and their differential frequencies may also result in differential outcomes towards interaction with ACE2 or priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of virus in host cells. In addition, we have identified some other potential key host genes like ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA and BTF3, that might have a critical role.",

This contrasting essential dynamics in dimeric ACE2 is explained well through the MM-GBSA based free energy of binding calculation between the 10th nanosecond final conformation of ACE2-RBD complex. From both simulations through MM-GBSA method, 1.5 fold strong binding of monomeric ACE2-RBD complex compared to dimeric ACE2-RBD, was observed (i.e. \u0394G=-75.58 for Dimeric ACE2-RBD vs \u0394G=-116.98 for Monomeric ACE2-RBD Complex).",

However, eQTLs for the gene were found in other tissues(Figure 2a and b)in GTEx portal. These eQTLs remained the same across tissue sets and showed similar effect in expression patterns(Figure 2b). Yet to corelate the expression of the gene with genomic variations, regions of the gene were explored for potential regulatory elements and overlapped with common variations through table browser tool of UCSC genome browser with an assumption that the variants having population level effect should be common variants(Figure S2d and S4).

It depicts brief mechanisms that may arise due to natural occurring variations influencing expression of host genes or structural changes affecting interactions within host proteins or viral proteins resulting in effect on efficiency of virus entry in host cells which could be key factor is providing differential clinical outcomes in different population groups. The figure depicts, higher expression of ACE2 is facilitated by natural variations with different frequencies in different populations and functionally associated with expression of the gene. The higher expression of ACE2 facilitates homo-dimerization resulting in hindrance to TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2. Monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. It becomes more difficult in presence of B0AT1 that usually does not express in Lungs. Further, natural variations in TMPRSS2, with potential functional role, and their differential frequencies may also result in differential outcomes towards interaction with ACE2 or priming of viral Sprotein, a critical step for entry of Virus in host cells.
