Because of the low number of COVID-19 test kits available at the hospital and which are reserved for patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 infection, each patient admitted to the orthopedic department and the operating room is considered like COVID-19 positive even if they are otherwise healthy adults with no comorbidities. Surgeons must ensure utmost care is provided to patients in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative settings to minimize risks of infection [4,7,8]. Personnel entering operating theatre must be reduced [9]. All traffic in and out of the operating theater should be minimized [6]. Intraoperatively, full personal protection equipment including N95 FFP2 masks, protective glasses and face shields should be used even if it reduces the clarity of verbal communication between theatre staff [10]. Consideration should be given to surgical approaches that could decrease operating staff exposure and shorten case duration [6]. Surgical team should be kept to the minimum, whenever possible [3,4,11]. In our department, we deplore the absence of N95 masks supplied to our staff. We only benefit from simple surgical masks to operate on patients during this pandemic. Surgical face masks are not designed for personnel protection and do not closely fit around the face and mouth. Their design is intended for preventing contamination of the surgical wound from the aerosols generating by the surgical team [9]. We have received face shields made and supplied by generous donors.",
