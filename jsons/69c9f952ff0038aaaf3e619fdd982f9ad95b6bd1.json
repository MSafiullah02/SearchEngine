For example, Wang et al. (2020) reported elevated levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, and above-cutoff event-related symptoms of PTSD among the Chinese population during the first outbreak, with no significant reductions in anxiety and depression levels four weeks later at its peak. Similarly, Cao et al. (2020) reported that 21.3% of the student population in China were experiencing mild anxiety, 2.7% were reporting moderate anxiety, and 0.9% were suffering from severe anxiety. These findings suggest that the pandemic has an adverse effect on the population's mental health, thus stressing the need to investigate not only its scope, but also its origins.",

Colizzi et al. (2020) recently warned that the fear of infection may exacerbate pre-existing mental health disorders or elicit extreme anxiety reactions. They illustrated the effect of fear of COVID-19 by a case report of a 16-year-old adolescent presenting with COVID-19-like symptoms and extreme and persisting health preoccupations, triggered by the fear of being infected. Other studies have demonstrated that intense fear of COVID-19, and particularly being in the proximity of a close relative or friend with COVID-19, are significant predictors of posttraumatic stress (Sun et al., 2020; . Furthermore, Morelli et al. (2020) reported that ischemic strokes have almost disappeared from the emergency room in a general hospital in Milan (compared to an annual average of 612 new cases of ischemic stroke, and a monthly average of 51 cases), and suggested that this disturbing reduction is attributable to the fear of being infected. These findings stress the importance of reliably assessing the fear of COVID-19, so as to predict and control its effects on both healthy and mentally ill populations.",

Assessing its factor structure, the authors reported a stable unidimensional structure with robust psychometric properties. The scale has been adopted in India and the UK (Harper et al., 2020; Sakib et al., 2020) , and was found to sustain its stable psychometric properties as well as to predict positive behavior change (e.g., improved hand hygiene, social distancing). Thus, as the pandemic seems to have struck many nations across the globe, the need to evaluate the scale's factor structure, its psychometric properties, as well as its associations with imperative and culturally-specific factors in different countries, has become eminent.",

The total score ranges between 7 and 35, with a higher sum score indicating a higher fear of COVID-19.

The scale was translated into Hebrew by a native English speaker, and then back-translated and compared to the original English version.

Furthermore, Factor 2 (symptomatic expressions of fear) was highly correlated with the anxiety scale of the DASS. Several demographic factors were associated with elevated COVID-19 fear, such that female participants reported higher rates of fear than did male participants, and participants who had a low SES reported higher rates of fear than did those with a high SES. Moreover, self-reported chronic illness, perceived increased risk for disease-related adverse outcomes, and having a death in the family due to COVID-19 were positively associated with the fear of COVID-19.",

The higher rates of fear among women can be associated with gender differences in sensitivity to stress, as women display a higher vulnerability to stress, as well as an increased risk for developing mental disorders following stressful life events (Tolin & Foa, 2008) . Higher fear was also observed among individuals with a low SES, a finding that resonates with past studies which reported a higher prevalence of psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity among this population stratum (Kun et al., 2009; Lorant et al., 2003) . One potential explanation to account for this finding is that proneness to distress is associated with poorer coping styles, weaker social support, and poor access to healthcare, which are more prevalent in groups with a lower SES (Adler & Snibbe, 2003) .",
