Ritchie\n7\n states that in\u2010contact birds are often not affected. It therefore follows that the best advice that may be given at this time is to place in\u2010contact birds in strict isolation and to institute sound management techniques including good hygiene, traffic control measures and the immediate and thorough investigation of any sick or dead birds. B Speer (personal communication) recommends an isolation period of 2 to 3 years without any fresh incidence of PDD before declaring an aviary free of the disease. Veterinarians in this situation must be mindful that their client's reputation, and possibly their income, is dependent on how they handle the confidentiality issues associated with a diagnosis of PDD. This must be balanced against the greater good of dealing with a disease that has the potential to have a devastating impact on aviculture and Australia's native avifauna. PDD is not, as yet, a notifiable disease in Australia and veterinarians and their clients should not expect any government assistance or funding in the detection and eradication of this disease.",
