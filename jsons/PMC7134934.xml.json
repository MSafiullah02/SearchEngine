On that day, 16 samples were collected, of which eight were kept in Hyderabad for analysis at the CCMB; the remaining samples were sent to Wickramasinghe's group in Cardiff, UK.",

The basic method for analysis of cryosampler samples collected at various altitudes was developed at the CCMB by Shivaji, who also established its validity with help from his colleagues through analysis of samples collected at lower altitudes (10-20 km); as expected at this altitude, Shivaji's group isolated various clones of an organism (Pseudomonous stutzeri) commonly found on Earth (Shivaji S, personal communication). However, using the same method, the CCMB group was unable to detect any microorganisms in any of the cryosampler samples from the experiment referred to by Wickramasinghe and colleagues.",

For this reason, we declined to be coauthors on the article they published in FEMS Microbiology Letters. In fact, the organisms that the Cardiff group isolated from the samples, which they claim came from space, are all normal residents of the surface of our planet.",

The fact is that all cases (without exception) can be traced to a single location of an extremely small size in China. Furthermore, if Wickramasinghe and colleagues were correct, new foci of SARS should have appeared by now; on the basis of what we know about the virus, this possibility would decrease exponentially with every passing day.",
