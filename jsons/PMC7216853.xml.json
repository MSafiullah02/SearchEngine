Those who have been involved in or studied military medicine recognize that this is analogous to triage during combat medicine, with nuances unique to the specific pandemic characteristics. This article is intended to provide an ethical foundation and background to help us and our health care communities through this remarkable time. It will not provide definitive answers to every particular situation. Decisions of resource allocation and surgical care during pandemics are best made when they are based on a sound ethical framework developed from previous health care emergencies, the most updated, yet evolving, medical and epidemiological information on the current emergency, and local context. One needs to take in consideration that many decisions will be location-specific, time-specific, and evolving as new information is available. Whenever possible, the burden of particularly difficult resource allocation and clinical decisions should be lifted from the front-line care providers and placed upon clinical triage teams comprised of those with a solid understanding of ethical principles, a reputation for clinical expertise and sound reasoning, and an ability to communicate with transparency and clarity.",

Autonomy is self-determination, making one\u2019s own choices. Non-maleficence is doing no harm, or acting to avoid harm. These four principles are foundational to the patient\u2013physician relationship and to the delivery of surgical care. Under normal circumstances, even if not expert at articulating them, we honor these principles instinctively, almost without thinking about them. They are intuitive to our daily work.",

At times, physicians and other health care providers must adapt to the altered and difficult circumstances in which we find our patients, ourselves, and our society. Altered circumstances may require alterations in clinical and surgical care, no longer focusing solely on the well-being of individual patients, but rather focusing also on the well-being of many patients and the larger affected society. In a pandemic, where needs may outstrip resources, the benefit to the whole population takes precedence over the benefit to any one particular patient. This is different than normal. The use of resources for one patient may mean the denial of resources for other patients. A patient\u2019s request for resources for care is still to be respected; a lack of fulfillment of that demand does not deny the patient\u2019s autonomy, it only acknowledges that at times not all requests for certain interventions can be met. During a pandemic, fair and impartial distribution of critical care is ruled by values that are not normally considered in an adequately resourced environment. Determining the best, most just distribution of limited resources and providing altered but still ethical patient care are the primary foci of this discussion.",

Is giving one year to live to a 70-year-old equivalent to giving that  one year to a 20-year-old?

Firstly, it does not actually treat all people equally, even though that is the intent. It favors more advantaged members of society, those who have access to information, those who can travel to areas with better resources, and those who can get to the limited resources first. In other words, it favors those with financial resources, influence, or connections. Secondly, it can ironically favor members of communities who are noncompliant with pandemic mitigation strategies like stay at home orders and quarantines and, as a result, these folks become infected sooner and get to the resources sooner. Finally, the \u201cfirst-come, first-served\u201d approach also does not maximize the benefits of available resources. For example, if a \u201cfirst-served\u201d patient consumes a substantial and ongoing amount of limited resources, then several patients who present later might be denied those same life-saving resources. Removing resources from one early patient with a poor prognosis to provide benefit to several subsequent patients with a better prognosis might be a very difficult, but ethically justifiable choice under the circumstances of a pandemic.",

A patient who presents to the emergency department with acute chest pain on a normal day is moved to the front of the line as others with less critical needs wait. Another example is prioritizing individuals on organ transplant lists. Treating the worst off first in such situations usually needs little moral justification. However, a limited resource environment challenges this practice. For example, a patient might present to the ED in respiratory distress and undergo emergent intubation and placement on a ventilator, while several other patients with less acute respiratory symptoms wait. Continuing this otherwise standard practice during a pandemic would not take into account other relevant concerns, including the post-treatment prognosis of the patient who is worst off. If this person has a poor prognosis for recovery and liberation from the ventilator, the patient might require a significant amount of resources and prolonged mechanical ventilation for weeks, resources that might be in short supply during a pandemic. These resources would then be unavailable to others, several of whom might survive if those critical resources were redirected to them. Giving priority to the worst off may be morally appropriate and medically preferred in a well-supplied resource setting, but it may not provide good guidance in a limited resource setting, where maximizing the benefits from available resources is important.",

Directing resources first to the very young has appeal, but it is limited in that it also ignores prognosis. For some pandemics, influenza might be an example, if therapeutics are limited, directing those therapies to infants with a poor prognosis would offer less overall benefit than directing them to school age or adolescent patients with a better prognosis. This approach also categorically excludes the elderly. A modification of the youngest first approach considers maximizing the opportunity to live through the various \u201cphases of life.\u201d For example, adolescents have already received a considerable societal investment of education and upbringing, and they have many life cycles ahead of them, phases of life that will not be experienced if cut short by a pandemic. Infants, on the other hand, neither have such an investment nor are they able to conceive of the life cycles that they will lose if their life is cut short. And, the elderly already have experienced most of their life cycles. So, infants and elderly would thus be of lower priority based on this approach. In short, considering infants as the worst off may be a component of a decision calculus, but it cannot always be the primary determinant of care.",

Respecting the four fundamental ethical principles, and applying and balancing the values described above (maximizing benefits, instrumental value, etc.) into an allocation framework, giving proper weight to each, is not easy. There is no one fundamental value that can be applied to a pandemic that will perfectly determine the just distribution of limited resources or the most appropriate clinical decisions. It is the application of multiple values, each informative yet individually insufficient, that guides us. The weight given to each one of these values will vary from one health care emergency to another, from one location or community to another, and from one time point in the pandemic to another. This is why clinical treatment organizations (hospitals and clinics) should strongly consider establishing a locally designated triage team working with multiple stakeholders in developing an allocation framework to guide decisions. These teams can then help make the difficult decisions, relieving the front-line health care professionals of having to do so. During a pandemic or a disaster, health care professionals may be physically and emotionally exhausted, and they also may become very personally invested in the care of individual patients. It is not fair, appropriate, or operationally sound to ask them to make the hard decision of resource allocation on their specific patients. Relying on health care professionals in the trenches to make the decision to remove resources from a patient for whom they have cared and invested deeply will likely increase their own personal stress and grief. This decision-making responsibility should therefore be the responsibility of clinical triage teams. Implementing these teams should enhance objectivity in the decision-making process, reduce conflicts of interest, and decrease the moral distress of front-line providers.",
