            "text": "The above-quoted incidence and mortality rates demonstrate that pulmonary infection is a significant risk to the neonate, and especially to the fi premature infant. The reasons for this are multifactorial. The full term neonate is considered immunologically \"competent\", in that most can respond appropriately to antigenic stimulation. The absolute number of T-cells is similar in the neonate to the adult as long as thymic function is normal during foetal life (Roberton 1996) . However, there are other considerations which render the neonate relatively more susceptible to infection. Studies have documented reduced leukocyte adherence and chemotaxis, as well as complement deficiencies that fi result in reduced phagocytosis and intracellular killing (Roberton 1996; Speck et al. 1979 ). Surface IgA is absent, and serum IgG can be deficient in fi early preterm infants for whom sufficient time for fi normal maternal IgG transplacental transfer has not occurred. Even if sufficient transplacental IgG trans-fi fer has occurred, this supply of IgG has a limited life span of only several weeks resulting in a physiologically normal, transient hypogammaglobulinemia in the fi rst few months of life. Furthermore, while the fi neonate can initially respond to antigenic stimulation with an endogenous IgM response, conversion of this response to a more mature IgG response is delayed. These deficiencies frequently result in a fi neonate with a limited capability to control and/or limit the spread of invasive organisms.",

The environment of the foetus inside intact maternal amniotic membranes is generally considered partially protective from external sources of infection. Therefore, one of the most common causes of neonatal sepsis is premature rupture of maternal membranes. Nevertheless, neonatal sepsis can occur even in the presence of intact maternal membranes (Kirkpatrick and Mueller 1998; Speck et al. 1979) . Congenital infections can occur through transplacental spread of a variety of organisms. During and after birth, the neonate is physically exposed to potentially pathogenic organisms which may colonise the maternal vaginal canal, or may be actively infecting the mother. The neonatal nursery provides a large source of invasive monitoring and therapeutic instruments, all of which can iatrogenically introduce organisms into the infant. Nursery personnel and family members inadvertently spread nosocomial infections even if strict antiseptic technique is maintained. It is not surprising, therefore, that, since the lungs provide a \"front line\" exposure between the neonate and its environment, neonatal pneumonia remains a signifi-fi cant problem in the NICU.",

The infant may fi simply demonstrate listlessness and/or decreased physical activity. Feeding intolerance or pallor may be the only initial clinical manifestations. Either apnoea or tachypnea may be present and either tachycardia or bradycardia may occur. The child may be febrile or even hypothermic. Laboratory tests may be equally non-specifi c, demonstrating either an increased or fi a decreased total white cell count. It is, therefore, common for the clinician to perform a chest radiograph to help determine if pulmonary infection is the potential cause of some of these clinically observed changes. The chest radiograph, in this situation, can become useful to localise the problem to a pulmonary aetiology, even if the radiographic changes are not sufficiently specifi fi c to diagnose pulmonary infection fi as the cause of the infant's symptoms. Given the fulminant potential for some etiologic pathogens which cause neonatal pneumonia, any abnormality on the chest radiograph which may suggest a pulmonary infection warrants the initiation of broad spectrum antibiotic coverage (Dennehy 1987; Kirkpatrick and Mueller 1998; Speck et al. 1979 ).",

            "text": "When taken in isolation, the study of the radiological manifestations of neonatal pneumonia is disappointing. There are few definitive correlative studies fi in the literature analysing the various radiological findings of pulmonary infection and comparing fi them with other causes of respiratory compromise, let alone comparing them to potential etiologic microbial agents. Most studies concur that the radiological findings alone are non-specifi fi c, such that it fi is almost impossible to determine a causative organism by their radiographic manifestations (Burko 1962; Currarino and Silverman 1957; Harris 1963; Roberton 1996; Wiesenberg 1973) . Furthermore, many of these neonates do not suffer from pneumonia in isolation, but may also have complicating features such as hyaline membrane disease, meconium or amniotic fl uid aspiration, persistent fl pulmonary hypertension, transient tachypnea of the newborn, secondary ARDS, patency of the ductus arteriosus, or a variety of other causes of neonatal respiratory distress. In one of the few studies looking specifically at radiological patterns in neonatal fi pneumonia, Haney et al. (1984) reviewed autopsy records of all neonates who died over a 6-year period and in whom an autopsy documented pathological changes of pneumonia as the only significant ab-fi normality. A review of their immediate pre-mortem chest radiographs revealed that the majority of cases demonstrated bilateral air space disease. Unfortunately, a pattern indistinguishable from hyaline membrane disease was seen in 13%, and a pattern indistinguishable from transient tachypnea of the newborn was seen in 17%. A few features have been described which may be helpful in identifying pulmonary infection as the source of respiratory distress. Some authors have postulated that one fi nding fi that may help to differentiate pneumonia from hyaline membrane disease is the presence of increased lung volumes combined with air-space disease in the non-intubated neonate (Harris 1963; Wiesenberg 1973) . Hyaline membrane disease tends to cause diffusely small lungs from surfactant defi ciency, fi while infection may result in over-inflation of re-fl cruited airspaces. Unfortunately, only 17% of the population described by Haney et al. demonstrated increased lung volumes, and most of these children were intubated on their pre-mortem examination. Others have suggested that air-space disease in the presence of a pleural effusion is more suggestive of bacterial pneumonia than of other causes of neonatal respiratory distress, especially when group B streptococcus is the etiologic agent (Haney et al. 1984; Leonidas et al. 1977; Payne et al. 1988) . The presence of pneumatoceles may also suggest a bacterial aetiology, a finding which is not exclu-fi sive to staphylococcal pneumonia (Papageorgiou et al. 1973; Wiesenberg 1973) . As well, a diffuse, bilateral, alveolar pattern that develops in the first fi 4-6 h of life is characteristic, although not specific, fi for early neonatal sepsis and pneumonia, again classically seen when group B streptococcus is the etiologic agent. Ancillary non-pulmonary chest radiographic fi ndings may be helpful in suggesting fi a diagnosis. Air-space disease in conjunction with periostitis or osteomyelitic lesions may suggest congenital syphilis, while a diffusely interstitial reticulonodular pattern in conjunction with characteristic metaphyseal lucencies suggests a congenital viral aetiology. A diffuse interstitial pattern alone is nonspecifi c, but if associated hepatosplenomegaly and fi intracerebral calcifi cations are present, CMV pneu-fi monitis becomes a likely aetiology. Although the initial chest radiograph may be non-specific, serial fi chest radiographs can be extremely useful, especially in differentiating the rapidly resolving pattern of transient tachypnea of the newborn from the more persistent pattern of neonatal pneumonia. As well, serial examinations are frequently used to follow the response to therapeutic interventions such as antibiotic administration.",

In general, maternal infection rates with tuberculosis and syphilis are increasing in both developing and industrialised countries. This can be partially explained by the widespread increase in migration rates into industrialised countries from countries in which infections rates are relatively high. As well, the HIV world-wide epidemic has permitted many of these organisms to propagate through immunosuppressed hosts. Congenital infection rates from syphilis were increasing in the 1980s and 1990s in predominantly urban geo-graphic foci. This trend appeared to peak in the early 1990s with over 4,000 reported cases to the Center for Disease Control in the United States, decreasing to approximately 2,000 cases in 1996 (Sanchez and Wendel 1997) . Congenital syphilitic pneumonia is an uncommon manifestation of congenital syphilis, seen in only approximately 5-25% of cases of congenital syphilis (Sanchez and Wendel 1997) . It is commonly referred to as \"pneumonia alba\", due to the pathologic whitish plaque-like appearance of the areas of consolidation. Radiologically, it usually appears as a diffuse process (Fig. 7. 2), but may manifest larger patches of air-space disease corresponding to mononuclear organizing infiltrates ( fi Roberton 1996). One helpful sign on a chest radiograph is the presence of osseous lesions such as diffuse long bone periostitis, a radiographic sign which is more commonly seen in congenital syphilis than pulmonary consolidation.",

This holds true both in regards to differentiating between the various etiologic microbial agents, as well as to differentiating pneumonia itself from other cause of respiratory distress such as transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), hyaline membrane disease (HMD), and meconium aspiration. The findings which have been fi postulated as helpful in differentiating infection from other causes of respiratory distress include the presence of a pleural effusion (Leonidas et al. 1977) , cardiomegaly (Hubbell et al. 1988) , and pulmonary over-inflation, the latter of which is fl postulated to help only in differentiating group B streptococcal pneumonia from HMD (Ablow et al. 1976 ). The most common radiographic manifestation of neonatal pneumonia is a bilateral coarse pattern of perihilar reticular densities which may also involve scattered areas of air space disease (Wiesenberg 1973) (Fig. 7.3) . Isolated lobar pneu-monia is uncommon in this age group (Ablow et al. 1976; Currarino and Silverman 1957; Haney et al. 1984; Harris 1963; Wiesenberg 1973) , likely related both to the aspirated route of entry as well as to the inability of the neonate to control infection locally.",

In order for the mother to be actively shedding the virus, maternal infection must have occurred within 3 weeks of delivery. The severity of neonatal disease acquired from a prenatally infected mother varies with the time of delivery. Maternal shedding is most active in the first few days of appearance of the rash. fi At this time, maternal antibody response is still developing, and little signifi cant antibody crosses the fi placenta. Birth in this time period, therefore, results in a more severely infected neonate, with fatality rates quoted at between 20-40% (Albritton 1998) .

Asymptomatic colonisation of the maternal genital tract with Ureaplasma urealyticum is common, affecting over half of all pregnant women. It has, however, recently been proposed that it has a pathogenic potential in neonates (Dworsky and Stagno 1981; Wang et al. 1997) . A significant as-fi sociation and causation has been established between maternal colonisation with U. urealyticum and chorioamnionitis, spontaneous abortion and early neonatal death (Dworsky and Stagno 1981; Wang et al. 1997) . There is an increasing volume of literature demonstrating an association between neonatal pneumonia and the isolation of this organism from endotracheal aspirates, pleural fluid, fl lung tissue and/or blood, especially in pre-term infants (Pinna et al. 2006 ). In addition, the radiographic changes of ureaplasma infection were evaluated in one study (Crouse et al. 1993) , where it was found that abnormalities were diagnosed by an appropriately blinded radiologist twice as frequently in ureaplasma infected babies, than in those who were culture negative. Unfortunately, the radiographic findings, which correlated with tra-fi cheal aspirate isolation of ureaplasma, were broad and non-specific. The radiographic fi fi ndings, which fi were taken to be indicative of ureaplasma infection, included any radiographic manifestation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), as well as a series of non-specific fi fi ndings of mixed interstitial and fi air space changes ( Fig. 7.8) . The study did confirm fi that radiographic changes do occur in the presence of ureaplasma infection; however, the relative frequency or specificity of the fi fi ndings were, unfor-fi tunately, not addressed. They concluded, however, that radiographic manifestations of typical type III or IV BPD are associated with ureaplasma infection, especially when these changes are seen at a chronological age that is slightly earlier (2 weeks postnatally) than expected from the usual fi ndings fi of BPD in neonates (Crouse et al 1993) . Interestingly, there is strong evidence which demonstrates a signifi cantly higher incidence of chronic lung dis-fi ease in infants who previously demonstrated culture-proven Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonitis (Wang et al 1997; Pinna et al 2006) .",

The young age of this infant is atypical, most cases presenting after 1 month of life cline in incidence of vertically and perinatally acquired infection from HIV in recent years due to a combination of educational programs and routine use of anti-retroviral therapies in developed countries, these interventions have not been as widely available in developing countries. As a result, 90% of worldwide perinatally acquired HIV infection is now seen in Africa alone (Graham 2003) . The clinical presentation of HIV infection in the neonatal period is still somewhat uncommon, and most neonates with HIV are relatively asymptomatic for the fi rst few months of life ( fi Marquis and Bardeguez 1994) . As HIV testing may be inaccurate in the neonatal period, prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously known as Pneumocystis carinii) is started when HIV-exposed infants are approximately 6 weeks old (Krist et al 2002) . Those few cases that manifest early respiratory symptoms usually do so from infection with an opportunistic organism, most commonly due to P. jiroveci. The described radiographic pattern is that of a fine in-fi terstitial diffuse pattern that rapidly progresses to diffuse bilateral air-space disease (Marquis and Bardeguez 1994) . Early presentation of changes of tuberculous disease or CMV pneumonitis in either the neonatal or infantile period should also raise the suspicion of underlying HIV infection ( Marquis and Bardeguez 1994; Graham 2003) .",

The topic is very broad, encompassing all infections acquired from any source while still in the NICU. This includes fungal complications related to the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. As mentioned previously, at least one study has documented an incidence rate of 17% of all low birth weight infants who will acquire at least one nosocomial infection during their stay in the nursery (Thompson et al. 1992) . Hemming et al. (1976) reviewed all nosocomially acquired infections in a 3-year period and discovered that 30% of them resulted in pulmonary infection. In that study, the most common pathogens discovered were Staphylococcus aureus (47%) and gram-negative enteric bacilli (45%) (Fig. 7.9) . A more recent review (Thompson et al. 1992) found Streptococcus epidermidis to be the most common organism responsible for secondary infection in infants with birth weights less than 750 g. Interestingly, aside from low birth weight, the other significant risk factor for acquisition of a nosocomial fi infection was prolonged ventilation. should instigate an early and aggressive response to diagnosis and treatment of a potential pneumonitis. An aggressive approach is especially needed when some of the potential causes of pneumonia in these infants are fungal in origin. Laboratory identifi cation of fungal organisms is frequently diffi fi cult fi and often delayed. In a review of fungal infections in very low birth weight infants (Baley et al. 1984 ), a mean of 33 days was required to diagnose the presence of a fungal infection. Clinically evident respiratory deterioration was present in all ten infants, and eight of these demonstrated worsening pulmonary infi ltrates. The chest radiograph, therefore, becomes fi an integral part of the early clinical investigation of these infants. A systematic review of previous films fi must be performed to permit recognition of new changes superimposed on the complex chronic abnormalities that are frequently present.",

Ironically, the risk of iatrogenic infection is rising with the level of sophistication of neonatal medicine. Both the clinical and radiographic appearances of many of these infections are disappointingly non-specific. The role of the appro-fi priate interpretation of diagnostic images in these children with multi-system disease becomes critical in those cases for which the radiographic pattern is suffi ciently specifi fi c to be diagnostic. In cases with fi non-specifi c radiographic manifestations, the pae-fi diatric imager has a critical role, not only in helping to identify a pulmonary site of disease, but also in following the childs' response to therapeutic interventions.
