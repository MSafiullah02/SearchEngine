            "text": "Vaccines have had a remarkable track record of safety. Nevertheless, even when manufactured flawlessly, some vaccines have caused serious sideeffects [4] . The mechanisms for these side-effects are diverse and are sometimes related to such problems as vaccine-induced immunopathology, as occurred with early-generation measles and respiratory syncytial virus vaccines [5, 6] . At times the mechanism may be obscure, as was the case for Sequential stages of clinical trials and overview of issues to be considered intussusception induced by quadrivalent rhesus reassortant vaccine against rotavirus diarrhea [7, 8] . Whatever the mechanism, the point to be noted is that such severe side-effects are not always predictable. To minimize potential injuries to subjects caused by vaccine side-effects during re-licensure trials, vaccines are tested in a phased manner. In this phasing, early evaluations are conducted in small numbers of subjects, so that if reactions are observed, they will affect a minimum number of volunteers. And early evaluations are typically conducted in the least vulnerable subjects, often healthy adults, so that if the reactions occur, their severity will be minimized. Successive evaluations of a particular vaccine are then conducted in progressively larger numbers of volunteers, and, as confidence in the safety-profile of the vaccine increases, in subjects in the ultimate target group, including persons who are more vulnerable (e.g., infants). With these successive studies, the complete ensemble of information about the vaccine's safety, immunogenicity, protectivity, and sometimes additional characteristics (e.g., transmissibility) is accrued. Moreover, the large number of subjects ultimately studied ensures estimation of these features in a statistically precise fashion, and, for sideeffects, in a way that enables detection of relatively rare events.",

Phase I trials are typically small, often on the order of 10-50 subjects, usually enroll healthy adults, and may be done with preliminary formulations of the vaccine. Depending on whether there are concerns about potential severe sideeffects and the need for biological containment of excreted vaccines, such studies may be done on an inpatient or an outpatient basis. For example, a genetically attenuated, live oral vaccine candidate might well be tested initially on an inpatient basis with containment if there is concern about transmission of fecally excreted vaccine organisms, or about the genetic stability of the candidate during the course of fecal shedding [9] .

Also in contrast with Phase III trials, such Phase II trials may be used to evaluate vaccine prototypes that will be later modified or augmented into final vaccines for licensure (e.g., a vaccine against a single serotype, when a multi-serotype vaccine will be required for the final vaccine), and may attempt to obtain estimates of vaccine protection based on prevention of a surrogate endpoint (e.g., the use of HIV viral load as a surrogate for the rapidity of HIV disease progression).",

Second, it is often desirable that a trial define an immunological correlate of vaccine protection -a level of short-term immune response to vaccination that demarcates vaccinees who are protected against the target infection.

Phase III trials usually provide the only opportunity before licensure for determining an immunological correlate of protection. Unfortunately, determination of immunological correlates within Phase III trials can be logistically demanding and costly. These problems result from four considerations: 1) it is necessary to contrast short-term immune responses in vaccinees who develop the target infection versus those who do not in order to determine an immunological correlate of protection; 2) at the time of vaccination and collection of specimens for immunological assessments it is unpredictable which vaccinees will acquire the target infection (\"breakthrough events\"); 3) most Phase III trials have very few breakthrough events; and 4) blinding of Phase III trials prevents knowledge of who received the vaccine and who received the control agent. The implication of these considerations is that it may be necessary to obtain suitable specimens from virtually every participant in the trial to ensure that immunological assessments will be available for a large enough number of vaccine breakthroughs to enable statistically meaningful assessments. Moreover, even when arrangements are made to collect the necessary specimens from the required number of subjects, measurement of immune responses in these specimens may not necessarily yield an immunological correlate of the vaccine protection observed in the trial, sometimes for obscure reasons [15] .",

Traditionally, it has been argued, partly over concerns about using poor populations in the developing world as \"human guinea pigs\", that trials in the developing world should commence only when a vaccine has been fully evaluated and licensed in the industrialized world. Recent changes in thinking have challenged this view. It is now recognized that deferring trials in developing countries to this extent carries the unwanted consequence of significantly delaying the availability of vaccines to populations in developing countries. For example, polysaccharideprotein vaccines against Hib, which have been licensed for over a decade in the United States and other industrialized countries and have nearly eliminated invasive Hib disease in children in many of these settings, are used only to a limited extent today in the developing world [20] . This inequity in use of new-generation vaccines has elicited calls for parallel testing, rather than sequential testing, of new vaccines in industrialized-and developing-world populations. Parallel-testing of new vaccines in the industrialized and developing worlds is now being pursued for both experimental HIV and rotavirus vaccines [21, 22] .",

In reality, the vast majority of vaccine candidates that are tested in Phase I studies do not progress all the way through Phase III testing, because of disappointing findings or because of a lack of sufficient resources to support the increasingly expensive studies in successive phases [2] . While unwelcome findings at any stage may lead to termination of the clinical development of a vaccine, this need not always be the case. For example, the live-attenuated, oral cholera vaccine, CVD103-HgR, was shown to be safe and highly immunogenic when given as a single dose of 5\u00d7 10 8 organisms in an extensive series of studies in North American volunteers. However, when the vaccine was subsequently tested in Thai adult volunteers, it proved erratically immunogenic [23] . To address this problem, the vaccine developer raised the dose by one log, to 5 \u00d7 10 9 organisms, and found the vaccine to be suitably immunogenic but still safe in a variety of settings in developing countries [9] . The CVD103-HgR experience illustrates that successful vaccine development may require detours in the phased sequence of clinical trials in order to accommodate necessary adjustments in vaccine dose, schedule, or even formulation in response to findings that emerge during the course of clinical studies. However, because vaccines that appear promising in developed countries not infrequently fail to perform as well in developing countries, and because such detours can greatly increase the expense of clinical development, completion of clinical testing of vaccines for developing countries may be exceptionally challenging.",

For example, CVD103-HgR vaccine against cholera was licensed in Europe for use in travelers on the basis of Phase I-II studies, together with Phase IIb trials showing a high level of protection against experimental cholera in North American volunteers [24] . However, it is unlikely that Phase IIb evidence from industrialized countries will be taken as a basis for licensure of vaccines in developing countries, in part because of the discrepancies between vaccine performance in developed versus less-developed settings and in part because of the uncertainties about whether protection in Phase IIb studies predicts the performance of a vaccine in populations experiencing endemic disease.",

Subsequently, PRP-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine was licensed for infants in the United States largely on the basis of proven safety and the attainment of protective serum antibody titers to PRP, without corresponding evidence of clinical protection from a Phase III trial [25, 26] .

One issue concerns the threshold for the risk/benefit ratio for a vaccine to be tested in developing countries. For example, a live oral, quadrivalent rhesus rotavirus-reassortant vaccine was licensed and then withdrawn from the United States market by its manufacturer because of an association between vaccination and the rare occurrence of intussusception [7, 8] . Understandably, this action had a chilling effect on the testing of this vaccine in developing countries. A meeting of experts organized by the World Health Organization acknowledged the rationale for the company's withdrawal of this vaccine in the United States, where rotavirus diarrhea is a cause of morbidity but not of significant mortality. Nevertheless, there was agreement among participants in the meeting that the burden of mortality of rotavirus in developing countries provided an ethical justification for continued evaluation of this vaccine in these settings [34] .",

            "text": "Because vaccines are administered in public health practice to healthy individuals, most commonly children, there is a higher expectation of safety for vaccines than for many therapeutic agents. In the past, pre-licensure Phase III trials were often designed merely to evaluate the safety profile of a vaccine observed in previous studies. Accordingly, the focus of such trials was on evaluating events that were expected on the basis of earlier studies, that occurred during an interval immediately following vaccination, and that were seen with appreciable frequency. Indeed, a common tactic in older Phase III vaccine trials was to evaluate adverse events only in a small subsample of the total trial population, obviating the possibility of detecting rare but potentially significant side-effects. Modern regulatory agencies now usually require that surveillance for adverse events be undertaken for the total study population rather than for a subsample, at least for events that can be detected passively (e.g., among persons presenting to health care centers for treatment), and that this surveillance be maintained for the duration of the trial. Increasing concern about vaccine safety has also led to other changes in the design of Phase III trials. Formerly, calculation of sample sizes for such trials was usually geared to enable detection of a certain level of vaccine protection against the target illness, with an acceptable level of statistical power. Detection of rare side-effects was not a typical goal of such calculations. The recent experience with the live oral, quadrivalent rhesus rotavirus reassortant vaccine, which was withdrawn from the United States market because of an association with a small but statistically significant risk of intussusception [7, 8] , has led to more stringent regulatory requirements for pre-licensure trials of newer-generation, live oral rotavirus vaccines. The United States Food and Drug Administration, for example, has required that these newer-generation vaccines be tested in numbers of infants sufficiently large to be able to detect whether intussusception is a vaccine side-effect. Current trials of these newer vaccines have therefore enrolled samples of infants many times the number enrolled in pre-licensure trials of the live oral, quadrivalent rhesus rotavirus reassortant vac-cine, resulting in greatly increased clinical development costs. Whether the experience with rotavirus vaccines portends regulatory requirements for substantially larger Phase III trials for other new-generation vaccines remains to be seen.",

The United States Food and Drug Administration licensed the vaccine with the proviso that the occurrence of this potential side-effect be scrupulously monitored post-licensure. This was possible because of the well-developed systems for post-licensure surveillance for vaccine side-effects established in the United States [39, 40] .
