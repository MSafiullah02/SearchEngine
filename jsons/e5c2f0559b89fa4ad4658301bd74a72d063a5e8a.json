Indeed, disproportionate fear of the coronavirus leads to dramatic behaviour modification, such as excessive house cleaning and misuse of cleaning products for personal hygiene or for food cleaning. Consequently, we are witnessing an increase in the number of exposures to the chlorine that results from mixing bleach with other cleaning products. 4 With school closures, young children at home are thus more frequently exposed to dangerous-although common-substances including parent medication, hydroalcoholic solution, potentially poisonous plants, and homemade products. Moreover, hazardous self-medication attempts to fight coronavirus also lead to their fair share of domestic accidents, such as essential oil poisoning, daily treatment cutoff, or, conversely, unproven medication use.",
