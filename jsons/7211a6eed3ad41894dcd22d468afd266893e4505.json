Bacterial polymers have important roles in pathogenicity, and their varied chemical and material properties make them suitable for medical and industrial applications. The same biopolymers when produced by pathogenic bacteria function as major virulence factors, whereas when they are produced by non-pathogenic bacteria, they become food ingredients or biomaterials. Interdisciplinary research has shed light on the molecular mechanisms of bacterial polymer synthesis, identified new targets for antibacterial drugs and informed synthetic biology approaches to design and manufacture innovative materials. This Review summarizes the role of bacterial polymers in pathogenesis, their synthesis and their material properties as well as approaches to design cell factories for production of tailor-made bio-based materials suitable for high-value applications.",

            "text": "Biopolymers are produced by living organisms and are synthesized by processive enzymes that link building blocks such as sugars, amino acids or hydroxy fatty acids to yield high molecular weight molecules. Bacteria can synthesize various classes of these biopolymers, such as polysaccharides (composed of sugars and/or sugar acids connected by glycosidic linkages), polyamides (composed of amino acids connected by peptide bonds), polyesters (composed of hydroxy fatty acids linked by ester bonds) and polyphosphates (polyPs; composed of inorganic phosphates linked by anhydride bonds). For decades, scientific efforts have been focusing on under standing biosynthesis pathways of bacterial polymers because of their involvement in bacterial pathogenicity and persistence. These polymeric substances can func tion as storage molecules, as protective capsular layers surrounding cells and as major matrix components of biofilms, which are involved in 60-80% of all human bacterial infections [1] [2] [3] . However, research on the physico chemical properties of biopolymers also sheds light on their utility for medical and industrial applications. Recent advances in synthetic biology and bioengineering methods allowed the production of innovative biopoly mers with uses or potential applications in medicine (for example, hyaluronate as a biomaterial), as additives in cosmetic products, as additives in food (for example, xanthan and dextran) and as biopolyesters in packag ing [4] [5] [6] . The rational design of biopolymerproducing cell factories has increasingly attracted research and commercial interest.",

These polymers have diverse biological functions, such as adhesion, energy storage or protection, and their synthesis is regulated in response to environmental stimuli 7 . Their physicochemical properties are important for bacterial behaviours, such as translocation, attach ment onto biotic or abiotic surfaces, invasion, protection and persistence. For example, bacteria produce extra cellular polymeric substances, which is a general term referring to various bacterial polymeric substances that entangle themselves into a matrix that encases bacterial cells. Production of extracellular polymeric substances is essential for the formation of biofilms, which are highly structured microbial communities 2, 8 and one of the most persistent forms of life on Earth. As biofilm formation is the hallmark of many chronic infections 2,9 , a large body of research has been conducted to understand the role of bacterial biopolymers in biofilm formation and in pathogenesis. Such bacterial biopolymers and their biosynthesis and biological functions provide targets for developing novel antibacterial drugs.",

            "text": "Polysaccharides. Polysaccharides are polymers com posed of sugars and/or sugar acids. They are classified into homopolymers and heteropolymers and they can be charged or noncharged, nonrepeating or repeating, and branched or unbranched. Diverse bacteria produce polysaccharides and store them inside cells (for exam ple, glycogen) or secrete them either as capsular poly saccharides that are linked to the cell surface or as free exopolysaccharides that contribute to the biofilm matrix (for example, alginate and cellulose) 4 . When motile, pathogens produce virulence factors and toxic mole cules (for example, flagella and exotoxins). However, when they switch to a sessile lifestyle, they produce different types of exopolysaccharides as matrix com ponents, such as alginate, cellulose and hyaluronate. This switch to the sessile biofilm lifestyle underlies the progression of many chronic infections as embedded or encapsulated cells are protected from immune cells and antibacterial drugs 2 (Fig. 1 ). For example, alginate within the biofilm matrix of Pseudomonas aeruginosa provides a survival advantage by protecting cells from phagocytosis 1 . Alginates (TAblE 1) interact with divalent cations to form dense hydrogels with high waterholding capacity 15, 16 . Production of cellulose (TAblE 1) provides similar advantages to enterobacterial pathogens 17, 18 . Escherichia coli produces phosphoethanolamine cel lulose, which forms mortarlike structures to stabilize proteinaceous curli fibres. These fibres mediate strong connections between cells in complex biofilms and provide resistance in highshear conditions 19, 20 . Some pathogens, such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus G9241, produce a capsule of hyaluronate, a linear negatively charged heteropolysaccharide (TAblE 1) that mimics the structure of hyaluronate found in human connective tissues. Thereby, these pathogens can hide their antigenic surface from opsonization and phago cytosis 21, 22 . Serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis causes invasive meningococcal disease and produces a capsu lar polysaccharide composed of homopolymers of sialic acid (Nacetylneuraminic acid) with (\u03b12\u21928)sialic acid linkages. This structure resembles polysialic acid moie ties of human tissue antigens, and such molecular mim icry imparts poor immunogenic properties on these capsular polysaccharides, making the pathogen invisi ble to the host 23 . Streptococcus pneumoniae causes severe lung infections and comprises more than 100 serotypes that produce different capsular polysaccharides to evade adaptive immune responses 24 . Secreted and capsular polysaccharides are used as antigens in conjugate vac cines (TAblE 2) . As newly emerging serotypes of patho gens such as S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines, the development of serotypeindependent vaccines is becoming increasingly attractive 25 .",

Chemical synthesis of polysaccharides is very laborious, costly and limited to low molecular weights and has been achieved for only a few types of polysaccharides.

The presence of hydrophilic groups (for example, hydroxy and carboxyl groups) on poly saccharides confers high waterbinding capacity and allows intermolecular interactions and crosslinking (for example, polymer-drug, polymer-polymer and polymerhost tissue and cell interactions). Polysaccharides can form porous hydrogels that can be used for drug delivery and controlled release of anticancer drugs 29, 30 , immobili zation of enzymes 31 , tissue engineering 30 , therapeutic cell entrapment and protection of transplanted cells from the host immune system 32,33 ( Fig. 2; TAblE 1 ).

Cellloaded 3D scaffolds of alginate or hyaluronate have been used successfully as an artificial extracellular matrix that provides a temporary environment to support infiltration, adhesion, prolifer ation and differentiation of various cell types, includ ing mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and embryonic stem cells 44 . Overall, bacteria are a major natural resource for the production of a vast variety of polysaccharides with many potential industrial and medical uses (TAblE 1) .",

Bacteria can produce polyamides or poly(amino acid) chains (Fig. 3a) , such as secreted poly(\u03b3dglutamic acid) (\u03b3PGA) and poly(\u03b5llysine) (\u03b5PL) or the intracellular cyanophycin (a copolymer of laspartic acid and larginine), which can func tion as capsules or biofilm matrix 45, 46 , or as storage materials 47, 48 , respectively (Fig. 1) . Similarly to the role of polysaccharides in the biofilm matrix, a polyamide capsule or biofilm is poorly immunogenic and con ceals pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis from surveil lance by the immune system 45 When produced by bacterial pathogens, secreted biopolymers can function as virulence factors, whereas intracellular polymers are mainly reserve materials that increase survival during starvation. The switch from motility to sessility of bacterial pathogens is a strategic decision that is often connected with the production of exopolysaccharides. Pathogens benefit from the production of high molecular weight polysaccharides as they are an integral part of the biofilm matrix and interact with counterions and other polymers to form a hydrogel-like niche 2, 16 . Furthermore, they protect embedded bacterial cells from environmental stresses, the immune systems and antimicrobial treatment. This lifestyle transition underlies the establishment of many chronic and hard to eradicate infections. Capsular polysaccharides are attached to the cell surface and protect the pathogen from phagocytosis and antimicrobial drugs. Glycogen is an intracellular storage polysaccharide that promotes the survival of some pathogens during the intracellular phase of infection. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are highly reduced biopolyesters that function as storage compounds that increase bacterial fitness and potentially function as an electron sink in anaerobic zones of biofilms 54, 56 . PHA-metabolizing enzymes are produced under specific nutritional and environmental stresses to enhance bacterial survival. Polyamides function as bacterial capsules or slimes to protect cells 45 or as intracellular storage material. Bacillus anthracis, which can cause lethal infections, produces such a capsule. Polyphosphates (polyPs) are chains of condensed phosphates that function as a storage material with high energy-rich bonds. The metabolism of polyP is positively correlated with the production of virulence factors 64, 67 . Extracellular DNA (eDNA) mediates the surface adhesion of cells and stabilizes the biofilm matrix through interaction with other secreted polymers and cations 1 . Proteinaceous components such as fimbriae, pili and flagella are extracellular self-assembling nanostructures that contribute to surface attachment, the formation of the biofilm matrix and/or bacterial motility. (TAblE 1) . \u03b5PL has antibacterial properties as it disrupts membrane integrity, and its crosslinked form was used in antimicrobial coatings 52, 53 .",

At the transcriptional level, transcription factors activate promoters that control the expression of function ally related genes. Such transcription factors include sigma factors, which are subunits of RNA poly merase, and regulatory proteins that bind to DNA regions upstream of biosynthesis genes. Some sigma factors are sequestered by antisigma factors and are released on exposure to external stimuli. For example, AlgU is a sigma factor that binds to the core RNA polymerase and thereby mediates binding to a specific promoter region upstream of the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster. AlgU is sequestered by the membranebound antisigma factor MucA in P. aeruginosa 85 and likely other pseudomonads under conditions that are not permissive to alginate production. On environmen tally induced destabilization of this complex, such as in response to cell envelope stress or on mutation of the mucA gene (for example, adaptive mutation dur ing chronic infection), AlgU is released and activates transcription of the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster. An engineered MucAinactivated strain 86 constitu tively produced high yields of alginate, which might be an avenue for enhanced production of bacterial alginate. Furthermore, small noncoding RNAs, twocomponent systems, regulatory RNAbinding proteins and second messengers (such as cdiGMP and cdiAMP) are involved in signal processing and complex regu latory networks that control polymer syn thesis in bacteria 1, 87 .

Therefore, biopolymer synthe sis and function might be new targets for anti microbial drugs to overcome persistent infection, antibiotic resist ance and antibiotic persistence [109] [110] [111] . Although this is an emerging field, there is evidence for the success of such approaches. For example, inhibition of the inter action between Alg44 and cdiGMP, which is required for alginate polymerization, by a class of thiolbenzo triazoloquinazolinone compounds reduced alginate secretion by P. aeruginosa by up to 30% (rEF. 112 ). OligoG CF5/20 (an alginate oligomer) decreased the thick ness of mucus in cystic fibrosis lungs and destabilized the biofilm matrix and the extracellular polymeric net work 113, 114 . Furthermore, biopolymerdegrading enzymes (such as alginate lyases 115, 116 and amylases 117 ) degraded the biofilm matrix. Finally, natural products (such as quercetin and curcumin) reduced the production of alginate and other polysaccharides by reducing the expression of the quorum sensingregulated genes and concomitantly virulence factors such as pyocyanin, pro tease and elastase in P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Yersinia enterocolitica [118] [119] [120] (TAblE 2) .",

DNA foundries use advanced software, robotic and analyti cal approaches to allow automated 'design-build-test' engineering cycles for the highthroughput development of desired cell factories through synthetic assembly of genetic elements. DNA foundries have higher experi mental consistency and lower costs than manual oper ations. Furthermore, modular genetic elements, such as promoters, terminators, ribosomebinding sites, orthog onal polymerases, untranslated regions, signal peptides, putative stabilization modules, genetic effectors and protein folding enhancers, provide a dynamic plat form to tune gene expression and protein production. Striking advancements include the introduction of inducible and/or controllable genetic switches, such as T7 polymerasebased expression systems 121 , pro grammable T7based synthetic transcription fac tors 122 , the riboTite system 123 , vector engineering 124 and CriSPr-Cas 125 tools, to allowed finetuned expression of endogenous or heterologous genes. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9 has been successfully used to simultane ously manipulate several genes. CriSPr interference has been successfully used to redirect metabolic flux towards Intermediates of central metabolism are diverted towards the provision of precursors for polymer synthesis. Four general mechanisms for the production of polysaccharides in bacteria are shown. Synthesis of some secreted non-repeating polysaccharides, such as alginate and cellulose, is mediated by multiprotein complexes, usually consisting of a polymerase, a copolymerase, carbohydrate-modifying enzymes and secretion subunits. The genes encoding such functionally related protein subunits are co-clustered in large operons, such as the alg and bcs operons. Some polysaccharides, such as xanthan, are produced through the Wzy-dependent polysaccharide synthesis mechanism. In this pathway the repeating sugar units and their linked lipid carriers are assembled by several glycosyltransferases at the cytoplasmic membrane, followed by flipping across the cytoplasmic membrane, the final polymerization step in the periplasm and secretion. However, the synthesis of some polysaccharides, such as hyaluronate, dextrans and levans, is less complex and is mediated by a single enzyme. Dextrans and levans are synthesized outside the cell by sugar transferases that convert disaccharides into polysaccharides and use the energy that is released by hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond of the disaccharides. Modification of secreted polysaccharides (for example, acetylation, deacetylation, epimerization and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) addition) can occur during translocation of nascent polymers across the cell envelope. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (for example, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)) are synthesized by a polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase that coverts hydroxyacyl-CoA derivatives of central metabolism into intracellular polyesters. Enzymatic processes independent of ribosomal protein biosynthesis synthesize polyamides.

Initially, several cell factories need to be gen erated to then efficiently convert precursor substrates into polymers. For example, a genetically engineered mutant of P. aeruginosa produced ~125 g of alginate from 1 g of dry cells 40 , which suggested a predominant flux of precursor substrates into the polymer. Indeed, understanding the major points that control the flux in the biosynthesis of biopolymers and the energetic state and relevant metabolites in the cells is a key step for increasing productivity. Thus, the metabolic engi neering of synthesis pathways aims to enhance sub strate and energy flux towards biosynthesis of the desired polymer. Biosynthesis of active precursors is an energyconsuming process and is commonly based on diversion of metabolites from central metabolism and primary cellular functions (Fig. 4) . Therefore, deter mining the redox state of the cells is important when one is amending metabolic pathways and redirecting www.nature.com/nrmicro metabolites towards the desired biosynthesis pathway. The redox state is determined by factors such as elec tron carriers (for example, NADH and NAD + ), oxygen availability, the carbon and nitrogen uptake rates and the kinetics of enzymes involved in metabolic flux. For example, the balance between the concentration of hyal uronate precursors and ATP levels, which are linked to the recycling of electron carriers, was crucial for optimal production of hyaluronate 39 . In B. licheniformis, increas ing the ATP content of cells increased the production of \u03b3PGA. This was achieved by improving the respiratory electron transport chain (through the Vitreoscilla sp. haemoglobin), ATP synthesis and nitrate metabolism 134 .",
