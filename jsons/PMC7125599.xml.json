It becomes an important source of business activities, contributing to income and generating employment. The tourism industry, however, shows considerable instability in demand (Sinclair, 1999). It is desirable that tourist arrivals keep increasing and contributing to the growth of income and employment. Decreased arrivals can adversely affect a local economy, with an especially substantial effect if one of the primary tourist markets sees a sharp decrease in international arrivals. Accordingly, efforts should be made to alleviate the level of fluctuation in tourist demand. Thus, the goal of volatility management for tourist arrivals from different source countries needs to be incorporated into the tourism planning process. A destination country should attract a distribution of nationalities, so the total level of volatility in tourist arrivals is minimized.",

The instability pattern of arrivals can differ by nationality because tourists from each country are sensitive in different ways to changes in these variables (Board, Sinclair, & Sutcliffe, 1987). For economic, political, and social changes, different tourist nationalities have different levels of volatility, or risk, as measured by the variations in demand. Policy makers in charge of the long-term development of the tourism industry should make good use of available resources to attract a distribution of tourists by nationalities to minimize the volatility of tourism demand.",

Mutual fund managers decide on optimal stock mixes that minimize return volatility (risk), based on a financial portfolio theory.

He defines risk as a variation in return in the theory. Simply put, the portfolio theory recommends that investors construct security mixes that have minimum risks for any level of return, or maximum return for any level of risk. In the contemporary finance world, the portfolio theory has become the most popular tool to build risk-minimizing portfolios of securities, given the expected returns of the individual securities. Sets of these optimal portfolios comprise an efficient frontier, which specifies the maximum return for any risk level from the possible investments (Fig. 1\n). Among the optimal points on the efficient frontier, some investors may prefer lower-risk, lower-return portfolios; others, medium-risk and medium-return portfolios. Still others may choose high-risk, high-return portfolios. Given the knowledge of the investor's return/risk trade-off and estimates of the expected return and risk associated with each security, portfolio analysis can determine optimal mixes of securities for the investor (Board et al., 1987).",

Similar to stock markets, tourist markets have different levels of return (arrivals) and risk (instability). Even though return and risk in tourism cannot be defined in exactly the same way as in the finance field, Jang, Morrison, & O\u2019Leary (2002), Jang, Morrison, & O\u2019Leary (2004) provide a hint about an application of finance-related idea to tourism research. Indeed, Jang, Morrison, & O\u2019Leary (2002), Jang, Morrison, & O\u2019Leary (2004) explained how return and risk concepts in finance can be applied to tourism. What they actually employed in their study includes profitability measured with mean travel expenditure, risk gauged with the standard deviation, and coefficient of variance (CV) using both mean and standard deviation. Along the similar line, we use the number of arrivals as the tourist market return and the standard deviation of a mean arrival as volatility, or market risk, in this study. As in selecting an optimal combination of securities, portfolio analysis can help determine the optimal tourist market mixes to minimize variance in demand.",

Earlier studies using the portfolio theory for tourism have primarily dealt with specific objectives such as bed-night demand optimization and seasonality minimization. However, to make wide use of the theory in the tourism industry, it is critical to apply it using readily available data. In that respect, this study uses easily obtained tourist arrival data. Also, the uniqueness of this research among the few financial portfolio studies in tourism is that it attempts to segment foreign tourists by nationality, as often is done in the industry, and to propose an efficient frontier to tourism authorities to optimize tourist arrivals, so that they can use the frontier as a long-term guide for development and resource allocation. That is, this research provides more practical and realistic solutions to achieve destination policy-makers\u2019 objectives of stable foreign tourism demand on a long-term basis.",

In reality, however, Japan, which generates more arrivals (return), should be more important. In other words, the optimal solutions are decided purely by the variance\u2013covariance combination of growth rate, assuming that the number of arrivals from countries is almost the same. Thus, using the growth rates may lead to erroneous solutions for Taiwan. In addition, the number of arrivals in tourism can be understood as comparable to return on investment (ROI) in the stock market, even though arrivals represent the static size of demand and ROI means changes in stock price. Tourist arrivals coming from a source country\u2014from a destination perspective\u2014are the number of tourists that a destination gains from that market (the country), whereas ROI from a stock is what an investor earns from the stock investment.

As shown in Table 4\n, a set of the mix solutions were found for obtaining the minimum variances of mean market arrivals. With the upper and lower limits from Table 4, point A was identified with mean yearly market arrivals of 300 and its standard deviation of 42.79. As mean arrivals go up following points B and C, standard deviations go down, unlike our expectation, indicating that points A and B are not optimal mixes. At point C, the minimum variance portfolio, which offers a standard deviation of 35.62 and an expected mean market arrival of 304, was achieved under the upper and lower constraints. At that point, the US should top the market share (20.6%), followed by the Japanese market (14.6%), Europe (10.5%), and Malaysia/Indonesia (9.5%). To achieve point C, when compared to data from 2005, Taiwan should increase arrivals from the US, Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia/Indonesia, and Europe while decreasing arrivals from Japan and Hong Kong. The point warrants the most stable arrivals across the markets but the least arrivals are expected. At point F, the Japanese market becomes the largest (21.1%), with a rapid drop for Singapore. When the volatility level goes up following points G, H, and I, the market shares of South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia/Indonesia, and Europe rapidly decrease, while the Japanese market quickly captures the largest share. At point I, Japanese tourist arrivals show more than a 40% share of the overall markets, but Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia/Indonesia decrease down to their bottom constraints. That is, in order to realize point I, Taiwanese tourism authorities need to focus on Japan, the US, Thailand, the Philippines, and Europe. At points J and K, the Japanese market continues growing but the USA and Europe lose their shares. At point L, the greatest mean arrival (647) is achieved, but instability (81.03) is also maximized. To achieve point L, Taiwan should focus on the Japanese market (58.4%), maintain efforts on Thailand (8.6%) and the Philippines (8.2%), but minimize weights for the rest of the countries. Overall, the extreme risk-taking policy makers would pursue the point L, by seeking the suggested market shares at L, so that they can reach the most arrivals possible. On the other hand, extreme risk-avoiders will seek point C to reach the lowest instability level.",

Thus, as optimal foreign tourist arrivals, selecting one point between F and I, depending on the destination's demand-instability preference, is appropriate.

For example, at point I (mean arrivals: 500), total arrivals would be 3.643 million (=3.378\u00d7500/463.7). In other words, the maximum expected arrivals at point L under the current upper and lower limits would be 4.713 million, which is slightly lower than the Taiwanese Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan of five million.",

Any points in the interior of the frontier line are not efficient, because points on the frontier guarantee more arrivals at the same level of instability or less instability at the same level of arrivals. Thus, policy makers should choose any points that fall along the frontier by allocating their available resources, as suggested by the optimal mix solutions of Table 4. As explained earlier, the optimal mix depends on an individual's return/risk (arrival/instability, in this study) trade-off preference. Thus, the points between F and I are highly recommended as results of the AIR, which represent relatively high levels of arrivals after adjusting for instability.",

As explained in the previous section, there could be a set of optimal market mix solutions. Taiwan tourism authorities can choose one of the obtained solutions, according to their return (arrivals)/risk (instability) preference. If they pursue a high-return/high-risk solution, they have to focus their efforts on the Japanese market. In addition, they need to increase the visitors from Thailand and the Philippines to mitigate the volatility of the Japanese market. To achieve the Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan, Taiwan should take the high-return/high-risk option and shift available resources to Japan. The market shares of recent years shown in Table 1 indicate a rapid rise in the Japanese market, as suggested, but the share patterns of Thailand and the Philippines are not in the same direction that the optimal mixes demonstrate in Table 4.",

This study stresses volatility management for foreign tourist arrivals and illustrates how to achieve quantitative solutions using financial portfolio analysis.

First, unlike stock markets, it is not possible to instantly adjust the market composition of tourist arrivals. Thus, the optimal market mix solutions can be used as a long-term objective, but not as a short-term goal. Second, tourist arrivals often follow a trend over time, but Markowitz's portfolio theory is not designed to address any specific trend. Instead, the theory simply considers interrelationships among markets. Thus, the solutions on the frontier do not reflect trends that may be the reasons behind arrival patterns. That is why it is important to consistently monitor the frontier of the same destination by conducting analyses on a regular basis.",
