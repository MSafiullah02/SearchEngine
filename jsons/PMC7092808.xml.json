Hepadnaviruses are partially double stranded DNA viruses that replicate their DNA by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate (Bonvicino et al., 2014). The human HBV is a cosmopolitan infectious agent and causes a serious public health problem with over 350 million people chronically infected with HBV worldwide and one to two million deaths per year (Hepatitis, 2019).",

Multiple factors, such as longevity, migratory activity, large and dense roosting communities, and close social interaction, predispose bats as reservoirs for a wide variety of viruses, including Ebola viruses, lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses, filoviruses, henipaviruses, and other paramyxoviruses (Han et al., 2015; Schountz, 2014). In recent years, HBVs have been identified in many places in the world and Tent-making bat HBV can infect human hepatocyte in vitro, suggesting that bat HBVs may infect humans (Bonvicino et al., 2014; Drexler et al., 2013; Littlejohn et al., 2016). Phylogenetic studies of HBVs detected in different bat species put forward a theory that bat hepadnaviruses may be the origin of primate hepadnaviruses (Drexler et al., 2013; Littlejohn et al., 2016; Locarnini et al., 2013). In Asia, bat HBVs have been detected in Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia and China (He et al., 2013; He et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2018; Van Nguyen et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018). In China, bat HBVs were studied in bats collected mainly in the South China, which are close to Vietnam and Myanmar including Yunnan and Guangxi provinces (He et al., 2013, 2015; Nie et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018). The prevalence and diversity of HBVs in bats from other places in China is not well studied. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and diversity of bat HBV in the East and Central China.",

Then we tried to extend the sequences of the initial PCR amplified region on both directions with degenerated primers. Degenerated primers were designed on the unknown sequences outside the initial PCR targeted region using bat HBV sequences from GenBank as template and paired with primers derived from the known sequence of the initial PCR product. By trial and error, only HBV sequences from four positive bats (2 from Shandong and 2 from Hubei) were successfully extended up to 883 bp.

Because full-length nucleotide sequence was not successfully determined in this study, a partial nucleotide sequence of the S gene was used for phylogeny. The bat HBV sequences found in this study were less than 4% divergence among the bat species investigated, but they were more than 4% divergence from bat HBVs from other places in China and other countries.
