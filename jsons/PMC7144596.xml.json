In Asia, the early pandemic complicated the delivery of psychiatric care1 and introduced fear, panic, and grief among the public.2 In prior disasters mental health systems struggled to deliver care around major disasters even as survivors experienced frequent psychiatric sequelae.3\n,\n4 The coronavirus pandemic is particularly problematic given barriers that patients in U.S. mental health systems face in receiving medical treatment. We conducted a rapid survey of psychiatrists to assess how their practice has changed during the pandemic and their opinions of how these changes affect mental health treatment quality and access.",

Psychiatrists among all practice settings shared similar levels of concern and familiarity with coronavirus disease, but hospital-based and outpatient psychiatrists reported different practice changes. All outpatient psychiatrists reported a move towards greater use of telemedicine. That these clinicians were also concerned about access to care belies positive media reports suggesting that rapid implementation of telepsychiatry will benefit patients. Other developments affecting care access and quality included cancellations of appointments and team meetings. The relatively lower use of telemedicine in hospital settings suggests that the modality may be either underutilized or ill-served to hospitalized higher risk patients, a group already recognized to be at risk during the pandemic.1\n",

For now, the low observed contact rate may suggest that COVID-19 is not widely present among these clinicians\u2019 patients, is not associated with significant psychiatric morbidity, or that mental health systems are not identifying patients at risk. These data on psychiatrists\u2019 information sources can aid information dissemination on best care practices. Although this small study carries a risk of selection bias and our use of a public survey precludes reporting a response rate, we achieved a fair mix of practice settings and will be able to ascertain changes over time. These reported practice changes may reflect efforts to mitigate quality and access issues rather than vice versa. Despite the small sample, a fair mix of practice settings is included, and our rapid distribution enables longitudinal follow-up among respondents.",
