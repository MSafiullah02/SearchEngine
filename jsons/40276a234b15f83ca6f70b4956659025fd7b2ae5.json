Objectives: To investigate the clinical, virologic and immunologic characteristics of pediatric HSCT recipients with HRV-PI infection. Study design: During the period 2006-2012, eight hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients presented with persistent rhinovirus infection (HRV-PI, \u226530 days). Viral load and T-CD4 + , T-CD8 + , B and NK lymphocyte counts at the onset of infection were compared with those of fourteen HSCT recipients with acute HRV infection (HRV-AI, \u226415 days). Results: The median duration of HRV positivity in patients with HRV-PI was 61 days (range 30-174 days) and phylogenetic analysis showed the persistence of a single HRV type in all patients (100%). In HSCT recipients with HRV-PI, T-CD4 + , T-CD8 + and NK cell counts at the onset of infection were significantly lower than those observed in recipients with HRV-AI (p < 0.01), while B cell counts were similar in the two groups (p = 0.25).

Peltola et al. recently documented that intravenous immunoglobulin therapy does not effectively correct the defective clearance of HRV in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia [24] . In accordance, our results demonstrate the presence of HRV-PI in HSCT recipients receiving intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy, thus suggesting that impaired T cell-mediated immunity may have contributed to delayed HRV clearance. Similarly, Gooskens et al. reported that impaired T cell-mediated immunity correlated with delayed elimination of the influenza virus in HSCT recipients [29] . In the present study, HSCT recipients with HRV-PI had absent or very low T-CD4 + , T-CD8 + and NK lymphocyte counts during induction and before transplant engraftment, moreover T-CD4 + , T-CD8 + and NK lymphocyte counts at the time of infection onset were significantly lower than those observed in HSCT recipients with HRV-AI. T-CD4 + , T-CD8 + and NK lymphocyte counts were also significantly lower at the onset of infection with respect to the time of HRV clearance in patients with HRV-PI, and inversely correlated with HRV load. These findings also suggest that the peak HRV load at the onset of infection is an independent factor with respect to the immunological status of the patient. Finally, there was no significant difference in the T-CD4 + , T-CD8 + and NK lymphocyte counts between HSCT recipients with HRV-AI and those with HRV-PI at the time of infection resolution. This finding suggests that the reconstitution of cell-mediated immunity might be crucial for complete virus clearance. Nevertheless, our study has some limitations, including the absence of virus-specific immunological analyses, the small number of cases studied and the retrospective nature of design.
