We identified three settings of interest for use of COVID-19 treatments; treatment for severe disease, treatment of milder disease in the community, and prevention in health care professionals exposed to the virus. We have focused on the use of remdesivir for the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease within this benefit-risk assessment. For the purposes of this study, we considered severe COVID-19 to include any patient who was hospitalised as a result of the infection.",

We would propose using the Sutton et al method, where benefits have a positive contribution to the wNCB and risks have a negative contribution [23] ; the overall wNCB would be considered positive (benefit outweighs the risk) where wNCB >0. A sensitivity analysis can also be used to examine the robustness of the assigned weights and whether significant changes would alter the benefit-risk profile [19] . Analysis using wNCB was not undertaken at this time due to the limited release of clinical trial data. Figure 1 displays the value tree of the key benefits and risks related to remdesivir treatment in COVID-19.

These have also been ranked according to perceived seriousness. Cardiovascular outcomes including hypotension and arrhythmias have been documented following the use of remdesivir [8, 27, 24] , however the risk of cardiovascular outcomes with remdesivir remains largely unknown [28] . Hypotension was reported in one patient in the phase 3 study investigating remdesivir in the context of Ebola Virus Disease; this patient subsequently suffered a cardiac arrest, although the author states that this death could not readily be distinguishable from underlying fulminant Ebola Virus Disease itself [8] . Cardiac arrest was also reported in a further patient in the remdesivir group reported in the COVID-19 study by Wang et al [25] . Multiple organ dysfunction, septic shock, acute kidney injury and hypotension have also been reported as adverse events amongst patients provided with remdesivir either on a compassionate-use basis, or in a clinical trial [24, 25] . Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome has been cited as an adverse event in patients taking remdesivir [25, 29] , and as such has been included here, although it is acknowledged that this may be related to underlying disease (COVID-19), rather than to remdesivir.",

The value tree provides a visual summary of these key benefits and risks, which have been ranked according to perceived clinical importance. As remdesivir is currently unlicensed in most countries, these include endpoints used in remdesivir clinical trials, and risks identified from available data sources. A literature search (including grey literature from government agency websites) identified relevant numerical data for these outcomes for both remdesivir, and comparator groups. Recently, the first results from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying remdesivir in the context of COVID-19 have been published [25] . The primary outcome suggested a reduction in the median time to clinical improvement, although this difference was non-significant (21 vs 23 days, HR=1.23, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.75). However, the planned sample size of 453 patients (151 on placebo and 302 on remdesivir) was not reached due to difficulties in enrolment, and therefore this study may have been underpowered to detect significant differences.",

            "text": "benefits listed in the value tree represent key clinical endpoints included in clinical trial protocols. These have been ranked in order of perceived clinical importance, from the clinical endpoint of mortality risk through to the surrogate endpoint of viral clearance. Many studies have utilised ordinal scales, which include a spectrum of the clinical status of the patient. The primary endpoint used in the recently published study by Wang et al [25] was time to clinical improvement up to day 28; this was defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. The six-point scale was as follows: death=6; hospital admission for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation=5; hospital admission for non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy=4; hospital admission for oxygen therapy (but not requiring high-flow or non-invasive ventilation)=3; hospital admission but not requiring oxygen therapy=2; and discharged or having reached discharge criteria =1. The primary endpoint in the Multicentre, Adaptive, Randomized Blinded Controlled Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Investigational Therapeutics for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Adults, known as the Adaptive COVID-19 treatment trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [26] was time to recovery [Time Frame: Day 1 through Day 29]. Day of recovery was defined as the first day on which the subject satisfied one of the following three categories from the ordinal scale: 1) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen -no longer requires ongoing medical care;2) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 3) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities. Other key clinical outcomes included duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen support, and duration of hospital stay, in addition to time from randomization to discharge or death. Surrogate endpoints assessing viral load clearance are likely to be less robust forms of endpoint data, and accordingly have been ranked lower in terms of clinical importance.",
