            "text": "Innovation in the services area -especially in the electronic services (eservices) domain -can be characterized by six decision-oriented attributes: decision-driven, information-based, real-time, continuously-adaptive, customer-centric and computationally-intensive. These attributes constitute the decision informatics paradigm. In turn, decision informatics is supported by information and decision technologies and based on the disciplines of data fusion/analysis, decision modeling and systems engineering. Out of the nine major innovation enablers in the services area (i.e., decision informatics, software algorithms, automation, telecommunication, collaboration, standardization, customization, organization, and globalization), decision informatics is shown to be a necessary enabler. Furthermore, four innovation drivers (i.e., collaboration, customization, integration and adaptation) are identified; all four are directed at empowering the individual -that is, at recognizing that the individual can, respectively, contribute in a collaborative situation, receive customized or personalized attention, access an integrated system or process, and obtain adaptive real-time or just-in-time input. In addition to expanding on current innovations in services and experiences, white spaces are identified for possible future innovations; they include those that can mitigate the unforeseen consequences or abuses of earlier innovations, safeguard our rights to privacy, protect us from the always-on, interconnected world, provide us with an authoritative search engine, and generate a GDP metric that can adequately measure the growing knowledge economy, one driven by intangible ideas and services innovation.",

Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of the Ethernet protocol and the founder of 3Com, observes that \"invention is a flower, innovation is a weed; that is, an original idea can be brilliant, profound and compelling -but what ultimately gives it power and influence is that it spreads [like a weed]\". Thus, while inventions are to be celebrated, businesses must rely on innovations to survive and grow; in this regard, successful innovations are those that spread in terms of reach, impact, and/or commercial success. Although ingenuity, talent, analytical skills, focus, and perseverance are required to achieve either, an innovation does not necessarily depend on an invention (e.g., witness the thousands of commercial successes that are not based on any invention); likewise, an invention does not necessarily result in an innovation (e.g., witness the thousands of patents that have never been commercialized).",

            "text": "Automation underpins most of the innovations in the past century. In the first two-thirds of the 20* Century, electrification was the engine of automation, while in the latter third it has been the computer chip whichtogether with electrification and digitization -has made automation a flexible and intelligent mechanism. Indeed, as listed in Table 2 -1, electrification is first among the top 20 achievements in the 20* Century, as compiled by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) [2000] ; it can be credited with spawning most, if not all, of the remaining 19 achievements, including the Internet and the continuous upgrading of the automobile, the airplane, the telephone, etc. While Table 2 -1 lists NAE's top 20 for the last century, we have also added three possible additional achievements for the early 21st Century: information technology, nanotechnology, and, what we define as, \"technobiology.\" (Technobiology emphasizes the contribution of engineering or technology to biological issues, including the development of new drugs, DNA chips, and bionic parts; in contrast, biotechnology emphasizes the contribution of biology to technological issues, including the development of molecular computers, cognitive ergonomics, and neural networks.) Returning to information technology, it should be noted that its key underpinning -the computer chip -has only been in existence for five decades; the first commercially available computer -the Universal Automatic Computer or Univac I ~ was built in 1951. Nevertheless, computers have already evolved through several generations. As indicated in Table 2 -2, Intel's first chip -the 4004, introduced in 1971 -had only 2200 transistors per chip; today, there are several hundred million transistors per chip. Indeed, Gordon Moore [1965] , co-founder -with Robert Noyce -of Intel, conjectured that the number of transistors per square inch of an integrated circuit would double every year, as it had up to 1965. In subsequent years, however, the pace has slowed down, with the data density doubling approximately every 18 months; this is now the current definition of Moore's Law, with which Moore himself has concurred. --Inside first personal computer (Altair 8800).",

            "text": "Another critical underpinning of information technology is telecommunication. Although computers (i.e., mainframes) tended to centralize data and -data-based -decision making in the 1960s and 1970s, the advent of computer networks, together with personal computers (PCs), have been a decentralizing (i.e., less hierarchical) force. The most important and indispensable network is, of course, the Internet; it is becoming a platform for commerce (i.e., Web 2.0), whereby trillions of computers and sensors will be interconnected and will, in essence, diminish distance as an impediment for collaboration and commerce [Cairncross, 1997] . Companies like Wikipedia, Flickr and MySpace are leading the way to making Web 2.0 style of interconnection and collaboration a reality. Furthermore, new wireless telecommunication advances will soon make mobile devices a multi-purpose services instrument, with more memory and better screens and where traditional voice and data (i.e., Internet and email) services will converge with digital music, video clips, video conferencing, satellite radio, location tracking, traffic reporting, and other personal needs (e.g., credit checks, online education, etc.). All of these technological innovationswhich are based on real-time computing -have ushered in a range of realtime or on-demand enterprises, which claim that critical business information is always up-to-date and available and that decisions can be promptly made; that is, the detection of an event, the reporting of that event, and the response decision can all occur within a very short time frame or near real-time. Clearly, as examples, the slow and inadequate responses to recent urban disruptions (e.g., 2001 9/11 tragedy, 2002 SARS -Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -epidemic, 2004 South Asia Tsunami, and Hurricane Katrina) demonstrate that although real-time actions are desirable, they are not a pervasive reality. On the other hand, Amazon does employ real-time information technology and automated decision making to suggest alternative reading material for its customers. Thus, real-time decision making is not only about real-time computing but also about developing the tools or algorithms to support real-time actions and activities.",

            "text": "Interestingly, economists claim that because of the astounding growth in information technology, the U. S. and other developed countries are now a part of the global \"knowledge economy\". Although information technology has transformed large-scale information systems from being the \"glue\" that holds the various units of an organization together to being the strategic asset that provides the organization with its competitive advantage, we are far from being in a knowledge economy. In a continuum of data, information, and knowledge, we are, at best, at the beginning of a data rich, information poor (DRIP) conundrum. The fact remains that data -both quantitative and qualitative ~ need to be effectively and efficiently fused and analyzed in order to yield appropriate information for intelligent decision making in regard to the design, production and delivery of goods and services. Today, retailers complain, \"We are awash in data but starved for information.\" Thus, in order to overcome the somewhat embarrassing DRIP problem that Tien [1986] forewarned, it is critical to develop more sophisticated data fusers and data analyzers -as a part of what Tien [2003] calls \"decision informatics\" -that could yield the information or knowledge required for making smart choices [Hammond et al., 1999] or for developing new, and possibly disruptive, innovations. Indeed, we augur in Section 3 that decision informatics should be considered to be a critical enabler of services innovation.",

            "text": "Innovation requires changes or recombination of processes, products and businesses, including people, technologies, systems, attitudes, values, cultures and organizational structures. For each of the past two years, BusinessWeek and The Boston Consulting Group have surveyed about 1,000 senior managers from around the globe to ascertain the 25 most innovative companies. Table 2 -3 summarizes the two annual surveys; it is seen that 20 of the top 25 companies in 2006 undertook product innovations, 14 undertook business model innovations, and 13 undertook process innovations. It is also seen that these 25 innovative companies had an average annualized 1995-2005 stock return of 14.3 percent, suggesting that innovation does pay off, at least in comparison with the Standard and Poor's 1200 Global Index, which had an 11.1 percent annualized stock return over the same decade. In examining the 25 companies' primary focus of innovation, it can be determined, to the best of our judgment, that 16 of them (i.e., 64%) are focused on services innovation and 9 (i.e., 36%) on goods innovation. This observation is consistent with Berg and Einspruch's [2006] findings. Of course, some innovations can be considered to impact both goods and services; thus, for example, we classify Apple's iPod and iTunes as primarily a services innovation, inasmuch as these goods have served to promulgate a major new service -indeed, a new experience.",

            "text": "In trying to identify innovation enablers, it should be noted that the enablers may differ between those for goods and those for services, and may further differ over time. For example, in the latter part of the 20^ Century, innovation was about technology and control of quality and cost for goods; in the beginning of this 21^^ Century, the focus is on rewiring the processes, products and business models in order to achieve efficiency and growth in the services sector, especially since goods have become more and more commoditized. Our focus is, of course on those enablers that can enhance services innovation. In general, there are at least nine major innovation enablers in the services area: 1) decision informatics, 2) software algorithms, 3) automation, 4) telecommunication, 5) collaboration, 6) standardization, 7) customization, 8) organization, and 9) globalization. The first four have been addressed in Section 1, although decision informatics is further discussed in Section 4. The remainder of this section considers the remaining five enablers: collaboration, standardization, customization, organization, and globalization. Collaboration -especially inter-company collaboration ~ is perhaps the most surprising enabler. After all, patents were established to protect intellectual property, long enough for the inventors to recoup a good return on their creative investment. However, since services are, by necessity, cocreated or co-produced, collaboration is essential. Indeed, von Hippel [2005] found that 40 percent of a company's customers modify its products in some way so as to better suit their needs. Moreover, as noted by Palmisano [2004] , the innovation challenges are too complex; they require collaboration across disciplines, specialties, organizations and cultures. Additionally, the easy access to information through search engines (e.g., Google, AOL, Yahoo, Microsoft Network, etc.), the proliferation of collaborative software (e.g., Microsoft Office Live Meeting, MySpace), and the open source software movement (e.g., Linux, Open Invention Network) have all combined to facilitate collaboration. (In 2005, IBM gave -royalty free -500 software patents to the Open Invention Network.) Chesbrough [2003] lauds IBM's open innovation outlook (especially as compared with Xerox PARC's closed approach); Govindarajan and Trimble [2005] recommend that past assumptions, mindsets, and biases must be forgotten (especially in regard to collaboration); and Sanford and Taylor [2005] further underscore this point by suggesting that companies must \"let go to grow\".",

Obviously, companies are collaborating not because they wish to give away their business, but because they wish to grow the business. On the other hand, a large number of individuals are collaborating -for free -to enhance an open source software (e.g., Apache), to network, including meeting new friends, sharing photos, or emailing internally (e.g., MySpace), to play a global game with guilds and imaginary gold (e.g.. World of Warcraft), or even to live in a virtual world with individualized avatars and Linden dollars (e.g.. Second Life), all to satisfy their creative, if not altruistic, and competitive needs. There is much to learn about collaboration, organization, and other real-time business applications from the always-on virtual world. In fact, the real-world is using Second Life type of environments to introduce and test new ads, to train new hires, and to design and market new products. Of course, the two worlds are becoming more intertwined when virtual land development companies act in a very realistic manner and when 300 Linden dollars can be exchanged for one U. S. dollar.",

            "text": "A critical by-product of collaboration is standardization. Standards establish clear boundaries of function and operation, eliminate data interface problems, define interchangeable components and platforms, and assure a high level of performance. Even with standards, there can be misunderstandings. A case in point is the difference between two wireless technologies: Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 standard) and WiMax (IEEE 802.16 standard). Wi-Fi is designed to be used indoors at close range, to connect a group of computers in an office or home to each other and to the Internet; on the other hand, WiMax allows devices atop buildings and towers to feed Internet service to appropriately equipped computers at broadband speeds and up to 50 kilometers away. In time, a high-end mobile device could have both capabilities, so that one can seamlessly move from a Starbucks Wi-Fi hotspot to an automobile with a WiMax capability. New wireless standards will have to be established as more sophisticated wireless technologies are introduced, including smart antennas (which, instead of sending a weak omni-directional signal, can adaptively focus its signal for maximum distance), mesh networks (which employ the ongoing connections among users as a part of its own adhoc network), and agile radios (which can communicate among a number of frequency bands, depending on which parts of the spectrum are free). Another area of standardization is at the interfaces of these technologies. For example, when cellular networks and Wi-Fi become seamless, cell phones will become an omnipresent device. A cornerstone of standardization has been the ubiquitous bar codecalled the Universal Product Code (UPC) ~ that has been uniquely associated with almost every good or service. The UPC is making way for the Electronic Product Code (EPC) which is stored in a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag or computer chip with a transmitter. The tags are being placed on pallets or individual items passing through the supply chain. When activated by a reader, the tags can send or receive information. Wal-Mart and the U. S. Department of Defense are beginning to mandate the use of RFID in the supply chain. The real question is how companies can go beyond compliance and derive real value from RFID. Suppliers implementing RFID face two sets of considerations: \"before the beep\" and ''after the beep\", where the ''beep\" refers to the point at which an RFID tag is read by a reader. Before the beep includes technical considerations to ensure that tags are properly encoded, affixed to pallets or cartoons, and positioned so that readers can obtain and interpret the data, while knowledge gleaned after the beep includes issues related to data management and abstracted information that could appropriately support or inform critical decision making. Early indications suggest that RFID can result in labor savings (as readers can replace employees by obtaining data from tags within 30 feet), revenue enhancement (as better inventory management can reduce inventory shrinkage), and more informed choices (as, for example, the elimination of unnecessary handling by automatically forwarding a product to the customer without having to go through a warehousing phase). Another benefit of employing RFID is speed; thus, whereas conveyor belts in a typical distribution center operate at about 20 to 30 feet per minute, the Wal-Mart mandate of 600 feet per minute is well within RFID's capabilities. Additionally, RFID can help suppliers take full responsibility for ensuring that the retailer's inventory is replenished on an as-needed basis, thereby eliminating lost sales due to out-of-stock merchandise. In essence, RFID serves to make the supply chains more visible in real-time, and as the price of tags decreases, RFID will become ever more popular and critical to the efficient functioning of any supply chain, including the distribution and shipping of goods.",

Depending on the type of sensor, other standards or protocols are required. As another example, IEEE 1451.4 is being promulgated to calibrate the output of analog sensors (e.g., temperature gauge) to digital signals.",

            "text": "Another critical by-product of collaboration is customization. Tien et al. [2004] have identified several levels of customization. Partial customization occurs in an assemble-to-order environment; that is, upon the arrival of a customer order, the stocked components are assembled into a finished product. As examples, in addition to computer assemblers like Dell and Gateway, Nike offers a program called NikeiD that allows customers to choose the color, material, cushioning, and other attributes of their athletic shoe order, and Procter & Gamble allows women to create and order custom personal-care products such as cosmetics, fragrances, and shampoos. Another form of partial customization occurs when the customer market is partitioned into an appropriate number of segments, each with similar needs. For example, Amazon targets their marketing of a new book to an entire market segment if several members of the segment act to acquire the book, although its approach is neither massive nor timely at this time. Mass customization occurs when the customer market is partitioned into a very large number of segments, with each segment being a single individual. Customization of clothing, car seats, and other body-fitted products is being advanced through laser-based, 3-D body scanners that not only capture a \"point cloud\" of the targeted body surface (e.g., some 150,000 points are required to create a digital skin of the entire body) but also the software algorithms that integrate the points and extract the needed size measurements. For example, European shoe makers recently initiated a project called EUROShoE {www, euro shoe,net), in which an individual's feet are laser scanned and the data are forwarded to a CAD/CAM computer that controls the manufacturing process. Likewise, electronics giant Toshiba wants to give Web surfers and walk-in customers new tools to view digital versions of themselves trying on clothes, accessories and make-up. Realtime mass customization occurs when the needs of an individualized customer market are met on a real-time basis (e.g., a tailor who laser scans an individual's upper torso and then delivers a uniquely fitted jacket within a reasonable period, while the individual is waiting). Tien et al. [2004] also suggest that goods and services will become indistinguishable when realtime mass customization becomes a reality.",

S. He astutely recognizes 10 events or forces that all came together in the 1990s and converged around the year 2000. They include: 1) 11/9/89, the day the Berlin Wall came down and the world became one; 2) 8/9/95, the day Netscape went public and ushered in the global potential of the Internet with a concomitant over-investment (and subsequent dot-com bubble and crash) in optic fibers, an investment which greatly benefited India's weak infrastructure; 3) out-sourcing, whereby support work -especially softwarewriting -can be digitized, disaggregated and shifted to any place in the world (e.g., India) where it could be done cheaper, better and faster; 4) offshoring, whereby entire factories are shipped overseas (e.g., to China) because of cost considerations; 5) open-sourcing, whereby software source codes are shared and improved by interested users; 6) in-sourcing, whereby one company allows another company (e.g.. United Parcel Service) to take over, for example, its logistics operation; 7) supply-chaining, whereby an efficient global supply chain links, for example, Wal-Mart to all its suppliers in real-time; 8) informing, whereby anyone can access data and information through the various search engines; 9) wireless access, whereby anyone can be reached at anytime and from anyplace; and 10) Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), whereby telephony is carried out over the Internet. It should be noted that flatteners 3 through 8 are actually different forms of collaboration. In order to counter the adverse impacts of a flat world on the U. S., he recommends that three U.S. versus China/India gaps have to be addressed: an ambition gap among our workers, a production gap of graduating engineers and scientists, and an education gap in our K-12 grades.",

As summarized in Table 2 -4, while all the world's population (except for Africa) is aging at an alarming rate, by 2050 the developed countries will only have about 2 working age persons per age 65 or older person and the comparable figure for the developing countries is almost 4. Additionally and barring large-scale immigration and dramatic changes in retirement policies, the demand for services by the retired and the elderly will be particularly acute in Europe and North America, where coincidentally the economies are primarily services-oriented. Thus, it is critical that services innovation be significantly enhanced so that the quality of life will not diminish in today's economically advanced, services-oriented nations (including Japan where only about 1.5 workers will support a retiree in 2050). However, Dychtwald et al. [2006] suggest that companies can mitigate the impact of boomer generation retirement by redefining retirement and transforming management and human resource practices to attract, accommodate, and retain skilled workers of all ages and backgrounds. Another interesting consequence of the flat world is the emergence of a \"stateless\", 24/7 (i.e., always-on) transnational enterprise. For example. Trend Micro, an antivirus software company with executives and laboratories spread out in seven locations throughout the world from Munich INNOVATION ENABLERS, AND INNOVATION DRIVERS to Tokyo, has been able to react and respond to viruses faster than Symantec, the market leader. With dual headquarters in Switzerland and Silicon Valley and its manufacturing center in low-cost Taiwan and China, Logitech is able to compete effectively with Microsoft in the area of computer peripherals. Wipro, a technical services supplier with headquarters in both India and Silicon Valley, is becoming a vendor of choice because it can adaptively deploy its 20,000 India-based software engineers and consultants, as needed.

For example, in 2005, IBM's pre-tax income was $12.2B (based on a total revenue stream of $91.IB) and it was divided into three parts: 28 percent from computer systems, 37 percent from software, and 35 percent from information technology services and consulting. Thus, IBM earned 28 and 72 percent of its profits from goods and services, respectively; as a result, IBM no longer considers itself a computer company anymore -instead, it offers itself as a globally integrated innovation partner, one which is able to integrate expertise across industries, business processes and technologies. What constitutes the services sector? It can be considered \"to include all economic activities whose output is not a physical product or construction, is generally consumed at the time it is produced and provides added value in forms (such as convenience, amusement, timeliness, comfort or health) that are essentially intangible...\" [Quinn et al., 1987] . Implicit in this definition is the recognition that services production and services delivery are so integrated that they can be considered to be a single, combined stage in the services value chain, whereas the goods sector has a value chain that includes supplier, manufacturer, assembler, retailer, and customer. More specifically, as indicated in Section 2, services are co-produced, whereas goods have traditionally been pre-produced; this and other differences between services and goods are explored in Section 5 to identify possible innovations in services. Tien and Berg [2003] provide a comparison between the goods and services sectors. The goods sector requires material as input, is physical in nature, involves the customer at the design stage, and employs mostly quantitative measures to assess its performance. On the other hand, the services sector requires information as input, is virtual in nature, involves the customer at the production/delivery stage, and employs mostly qualitative measures to assess its performance. Since services are to a large INNOVATION ENABLERS, AND INNOVATION DRIVERS extent subject to customer satisfaction and since, as Tien and Cahn [1981] postulated and validated, \"satisfaction is a function of expectation,\" service performance or satisfaction can be enhanced through the effective \"management\" of expectation. Parasuraman et al. [1998] employed the gap between expectation and actual service to evaluate service quality, as defined by reliability, tangibles, assurance, responsiveness and empathy. Tien and Berg [2003] also call for viewing services as systems that require integration with other systems and processes, over both time and space; in fact, they make a case for further developing a branch of systems engineering that focuses on problems and issues which arise in the services sector. In this manner, they demonstrate how the traditional systems approach to analysis, control and optimization can be applied to a system of systems that are each within the province of a distinct service provider. They underscore this special focus not only because of the size and importance of the services sector but also because of the unique opportunities that systems engineering can exploit in the design and joint production and delivery of services. In particular, a number of service systems engineering methods are identified to enhance the design and production/delivery of services, especially taking advantage of the unique features that characterize services -namely, services, especially emerging e(lectronic)-services, are decisiondriven, information-based, customer-centric, computationally-intensive, and productivity-focused.",

            "text": "As we consider the future, it is perhaps more appropriate to focus on emerging e-services. E-services are, of course, totally dependent on information technology; they include, as examples, financial services, banking, airline reservation systems, and customer goods marketing. The introduction of the Universal Product Code (UPC) and the optical scanning of these codes have not only, for example, shortened checkout times but also yielded critical data for undertaking marketing research. Furthermore, the UPC has been critical to the coupling of the production and logistics stages in the supply chain. Additional e-services are based on the Global Positioning System (GPS), which is bringing significant productivity improvements to the world's transportation and emergency service (i.e., police, ambulance and fire) agencies, as well as to other dispatch-oriented industries (e.g., taxicab companies, delivery services, and maintenance services). Of course, the Internet is the world's data superhighway in which businesses can interact with their far-flung offices, or with other businesses; customers can buy goods and services; and individuals can exchange e-mails or surf for information. Despite the \"dot-com bubble\" burst in the early 2000s, the Internet is flourishing and e-services or e-commerce is continuing to grow. Table 2 -6, the electronic service enterprises interact or \"co-produce\" with their customers in a digital (including voice mail, e-mail, and Internet) medium, as compared to the physical environment in which the traditional or bricks-and-mortar service enterprises interact with their customers. Similarly, in comparison to traditional services which include low-wage jobs, the electronic services typically employ high-wage earnersand they are more demanding in their requirements for self-service, transaction speed, and computation. In regard to data sources that could be used to help make appropriate service decisions, both sets of services rely on multiple data sources; however, the traditional services are primarily based on homogeneous (mostly quantitative) data, while the electronic services could require nonhomogeneous (i.e., both quantitative and qualitative) data. Paradoxically, the traditional service enterprises have been driven by data, although data availability and accuracy have been limited (especially before the pervasive use of the UPC); likewise, the emerging e-service enterprises have been INNOVATION ENABLERS, AND INNOVATION DRIVERS driven by information (i.e., processed data), although information availability and accuracy have been limited, again due to the aforementioned data rich, information poor (DRIP) conundrum. Consequently, while traditional services -like traditional manufacturing -are based on economies of scale and a standardized approach, electronic services -like electronic manufacturing -emphasize economies of expertise or knowledge and an adaptive approach. The result is a shift in focus from mass production to mass customization (whereby a service is produced and delivered in response to a customer's stated or imputed needs); it is intended to provide superior value to customers by meeting their unique needs. It is in this area of customization -where customer involvement is not only at the goods design stage but also at the manufacturing or production stage -that services and manufacturing are merging in concept. Another critical distinction between traditional and electronic services is that, although all services require decisions to be made, the former services are primarily based on predetermined decision rules, while the latter could require more real-time, adaptive decisions; that is why Tien [2003] has advanced a decision informatics paradigm that relies on both information and decision technologies from a real-time perspective.",

Today, there is a vast array of new experiences, including interactive games, World Wide Web sites, motion-based simulators, 3D movies and virtual reality.

As shown in Table 2 -8, data represent basic transactions captured during operations, while information represents processed data (e.g., derivations, groupings, patterns, etc.). Clearly, except for simple operational decisions, decision making at the tactical or higher levels requires, at a minimum, appropriate information or processed data. Table 2 -8 also identifies knowledge as processed information (together with experiences, beliefs, values, cultures, etc.), and wisdom as processed knowledge (together with insights, theories, etc.). In our vernacular, strategic decisions can only be made with knowledge, while systemic decisions can only be made with wisdom. Although the literature sometimes does not distinguish between data and information, it is critical to do so, especially if we wish to avoid the data-rich, information-poor (DRIP) conundrum that is identified in Section 1. In fact, if we were to strictly adhere to such a distinction, we would conclude that given the current state of information technology, it should be referred to as \"data technology\" and, as indicated in Section 1, we are not in a knowledge -but only a dataeconomy.",

As depicted in Table 2 -9(a), the nature of the required real-time decision (regarding the production and/or delivery of a service) determines, where appropriate and from a systems engineering perspective, the data to be collected (possibly, from multiple, non-homogeneous sources) and the realtime fusion/analysis to be undertaken to obtain the needed information for input to the modeling effort which, in turn, provides the knowledge to identify and support the required decision in a timely manner. The feedback loops in Table 2 -9(a) are within the context of systems engineering; they serve to refine the analysis and modeling steps. As depicted in Table 2 -9(b), the driving force behind decision informatics is the decision foci. In regard to services innovation, the decisions concern how best to a) collaborate (especially in regard to self-serving, contributing, communicating, standardizing and globalizing issues), b) customize (especially in regard to profiling and personalizing issues), c) integrate (especially in regard to supply chaining, demand chaining, data warehousing and systematizing issues), and d) adapt (especially in regard to real-timing, automating, organizing and motivating issues). Actually, collaboration, customization, integration, and adaptation may be considered to be the four major drivers for services innovation; that is, services are promulgated in order to further collaboration, customization, integration and adaptation. Not surprisingly, the four services innovation drivers somewhat overlap the nine innovation enablers that are described in Sections 1 and 2; in fact, collaboration and customization are at once both drivers and enablers for services innovation.",

Data fusion and analysis methods concern the mining, visualization and management of data, information and knowledge; they include statistics, mathematics, management science and cognitive science. However, from the perspective of services innovation, it should be noted that the available data fusion and analysis methods suffer from two critical shortcomings. First, the available methods are predominantly focused on quantitative data, which is, of course, very limiting since it is estimated that over 80 percent of the available data are qualitative in nature. Second, the available methods are primarily focused, if not trained, on a fixed data set, whereas in the real-world, there is a constant stream of data that require continuous fusion and analysis. Clearly, methods must be developed that can fuse and analyze a steady stream of non-homogeneous (i.e., quantitative and qualitative) data.",

            "text": "It is helpful to further address data fusion, which can take place at the signal level, the feature level and/or the decision level. Signal-level fusion refers to combining the signals of a group of sensors. The signals from the sensors can be modeled as random variables, contaminated by uncorrected noise. The fusion process is considered an estimation procedure. Only if the sensory signals are strictly homogeneous or alike can the fusion take place at the signal level. Feature-level fusion refers to combining the features that are extracted from sensory data. A set or vector of primary features is first obtained, then composite features can be created, and analysis is typically undertaken on the composite features. Thus, Ayache and Faugeras [1989] use extended Kalman filtering to efficiently integrate sequences of images at the feature-level in order to determine the surfaces of three-dimensional objects. The feature-level fusion enables the overall uncertainty concerning the location of objects to be reduced in the presence of environmental and sensory noise. Gunatilaka and Baertlein [2001] extract geographic features by nonlinear optimization techniques, and then they determine whether a certain type of mine is located in the region by applying Bayesian decision theory to the composite features.On the other hand, decision-level fusion refers to combining information extracted from sensory data at the highest level of abstraction; it is commonly employed in applications where multiple sensors are of a different nature or are located in different regions of the environment. Fusion is accomplished by judicious processing of the individual sensory information, or through symbolic reasoning that may make use of prior knowledge from a world model or sources external to the system. The prevailing techniques for decision-or symbol-level fusion include Bayesian (i.e., maximum a posteriori) estimation [Gunatilaka and Baertlein, 2001] and Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning [Garvey et al., 1981] . Evidential reasoning is actually an extension of the Bayesian approach; it makes explicit any lack of information concerning a proposition's uncertainty by separating firm belief for the proposition from just its plausibility. In the Bayesian approach, all propositions (e.g., objects in the environment) for which there are no information are assigned an equal a priori probability. When additional information from a sensor becomes INNOVATION ENABLERS, AND INNOVATION DRIVERS available and the number of unknown propositions is large relative to the number of known propositions, an intuitively unsatisfying result of the Bayesian approach is that the probabilities of known propositions become unstable. In the Dempster-Shafer approach, this is avoided by not assuming an a priori probability. Instead, the unknown propositions are assigned to \"ignorance\", which is reduced only when supporting information becomes available. Evidential reasoning is introduced to allow each sensor to contribute information at its own level of detail. For example, one sensor may be able to provide information that can be used to distinguish individual objects, whereas the information from another sensor may only be able to distinguish classes of objects.",

Second, most of the available methods are unable to cope with changing circumstances; instead, we need methods that are adaptive so that decisions can be made in real-time.

While terrorist acts are the most insidious and onerous of all disruptions, it is obvious that there are many similarities in the way one should deal with these willful acts and those caused by natural and accidental incidents that have also resulted in adverse and severe consequences. However, there is one major and critical difference between terrorist acts and the other types of disruptions: the terrorist acts are willfuland therefore also adaptive. One must counter these acts with the same, if not more sophisticated, willful, adaptive and informed approach. Real-time, information-based decision making (i.e., decision informatics) is the approach that can be employed to make the right decisions at the right time in the various stages of a disruption. As discussed above, it is focused on decisions and based on multiple data sources, data fusion and analysis methods, timely information, stochastic decision models and a systems engineering outlook. The approach provides a consistent way to address realtime emergency issues, including those concerned with the preparation for a major disruption, the prediction of such a disruption, the prevention or mitigation of the disruption, the detection of the disruption, the response to the disruption, and the recovery steps that are necessary to adequately, if not fully, recuperate from the disruption. As a consequence, we must trade off between productivity and security; between just-in-time interdependencies and just-in-case inventories; and between high-probability, low-risk life-asusual situations and low-probability, high-risk catastrophes.",

Additionally, since any data analysis, modeling or design effort should only be undertaken for some purpose or decision, all analyses, modeling and design activities should be able to be viewed within the decision informatics framework, including the development of new decisiontheoretic tools that can integrate sensed data in support of real-time decision making.",

            "text": "Sections 1 through 4 have, in essence, defined a process for undertaking services innovation. Table 2 -11 provides a summary of the process. It identifies the relationships between goods, services and experiences (which are typically integrated products and services); shows how the nine enablers and four drivers interact to yield new innovations in goods, services and experiences; and highlights why decision informatics is a necessary enabler. As noted earlier, decision informatics constitutes a pivotal step in developing or deciding on a new services innovation; additionally, it is, if appropriate, central to (i.e., the brain in) any software algorithm that can serve to automate -and thereby enhance the productivity of -the developed innovation. As we focus on services innovation, it is helpful to reexamine the four innovation drivers: collaboration, customization, integration and adaptation. All four are directed at empowering the individual -that is, at recognizing that the individual can a) contribute in a collaborative situation. b) receive customized or personalized attention, c) access an integrated system or process, and d) obtain adaptive real-time or just-in-time input. Nevertheless, the question remains: where are the areas or white spaces for possible new innovations in services (and/or experiences)? The answer can be found by considering the nine innovation enablers (described in Section 1 and 2), the six services-related decision attributes (identified in Section 3), and the four services innovation drivers (discussed in Section 4); their coverage serve to identify the potential white spaces. As examples, Table 2 -12 identifies the primary drivers, enablers and decision attributes associated with 45 services innovation areas, assuming 5 in each of the 9 service categories or domains. Although both the domain areas and the identification process are quite subjective, it is interesting to note that the drivers, in order of impact, are: integration (16 out of 45), adaptation (13), customization (12), and collaboration (4). Similarly, the enablers are: automation (19), organization (7), globalization (5), customization (5), standardization (5), telecommunication (2), and collaboration (2). (Inasmuch as decision informatics and software algorithms are somewhat pervasive and pertinent to all areas, only 7 of the 9 enablers are considered.)",

Paradoxically, one set of white spaces concem innovations that can mitigate the unforeseen consequences or abuses of earlier innovations. Antivirus companies like Symantec and Trend Micro are barely able to cope with the avalanche of new viruses and virus delivery schemes. Ad spamming is taking over the email system, much like junk mail took over the traditional postal system. Spy ware, a form of adware that tracks an individual's every click and sends the data to advertisers, has now infected some 80 percent of all personal computers in the U. S. Indeed, fraudulent clicks by robotic viruses have cost advertisers millions of dollars. In \"phishing\" or creating a replica of an existing Web page to fool users into submitting personal, financial or password data, hackers are stealing individual identities and committing fraud. Sadly, the same innovations that have enhanced global interconnectedness have engendered new vulnerabilities, including cyber attacks. Thus, electronic viruses, biological agents and other toxic materials can turn a nation's \"lifelines\" into \"deathlines\", in that they can be used to facilitate the spread of these materials -whether by accident or by willful act. In this vein, the Internet -with over a billion users -has become a terrorist tool; jihad websites are recruiting members, soliciting funds, and promoting violence (e.g., by showing the beheading of hostages). Also, as evidenced by the 9/11 attack, components of an infrastructure (e.g., airplanes) can be used as weapons of destruction. In sum, new and more powerful innovations are required to secure and safeguard those innovations -including mobile devices, electronic systems, and, more recently, even RFTD tags -that define and underpin our advanced economies.",

            "text": "A related set of white spaces concern innovations that can safeguard our rights to privacy. In fact, in 2003 the U. S. Congress stopped the Terrorism Information Awareness program sponsored by the Department of Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) because it was going to mine massive amounts of data, including personal transactions of U. S. citizens, in order to connect the dots leading to terrorists and terrorism. Moreover, the continuing anti-terrorist surveillance program by the U. S. government and the widely acclaimed and increasingly profitable search, marketing and even social networking innovations on the Intemet could easily be considered to be an invasion of privacy. As an example, constitutional scholars feel that current wiretapping by the National Security Agency (NSA) on communications between individuals outside the U. S. and citizens inside the country is both unconstitutional and against the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Additionally, identifying one's buying habits, broadcasting one's location and submitting data to social network sites about one's friends (without their explicit permission) are also questionable from a privacy perspective. Clearly, sophisticated innovations are required to prevent incursions into our private lives. Another set of white spaces concern innovations that can protect us from the always-on, interconnected world. With a 24/7 electronic world and wireless mobile devices, we are unfortunately always reachable -for mostly business purposes ~ from anywhere in the world. Increasingly, our business life extends into and takes over or displaces our home life. Thus, although our work output has increased (mostly due to our increased working hours), we are not necessarily more productive. Furthermore, as Surowiecki [2005] suggests, more electronic devices and gadgets do not necessarily increase our well-being; instead, over time, we tend to take these innovations for granted and to raise our expectations for what future innovations can bring, thus mitigating our overall satisfaction -which, as Tien and Cahn [1981] confirmed, is a function of our expectation. Hallowell [2006] argues that the 24/7 frenzy has drained us of creativity, humanity, mental well-being, and the ability to focus on what truly matters -we suffer from a culturally induced attention deficit disorder. He suggests that we can teach ourselves to move from the F-state (i.e., frenzied, flailing, fearful, forgetful, and furious) to the C-state (i.e., cool, calm, clear, consistent, curious, and courteous). Nevertheless, new innovations are required to protect ourselves from the F-state.",

Likewise, Wikipedia -with an anyone-can-contribute ethos and a 200 gigabyte database, containing 3 million articles in 200 languages -suffers from the same problem, even though some contributions can be deleted by a Wikipedia elite of some 800 longtime contributors. Interestingly, in a recent comparison between Wikipedia and its major peer. Encyclopedia Britannica, INNOVATION ENABLERS, AND INNOVATION DRIVERS Nature [2005] asked experts from several disciplines to review 50 articles ~ with identical subject matter and of similar length -from each encyclopedia and assess them for their accuracy, resulting in 2.9 errors per article for Encyclopaedia Britannica versus 3.9 errors per article for Wikipedia.

Moreover, to our knowledge, most of the BI software attempts to make sense of the transactions data and to present it in a way that anyone, from a sales representative to a chief executive, can understand and use; indeed, for the most part, the software represents a query window into data warehouses.

For example, everyone could use a smart alter ego or agent which could analyze, and perhaps fuse, all the existing and incoming e-mails, phone calls, Web pages, news clips, and stock quotes, and assigns every item a priority based on the individual's preferences and observed behavior. It should be able to perform a semantic analysis of a message text, judge the sender-recipient relationships by examining an organizational chart and recall the urgency of the recipient's responses to previous messages from the same sender. To this, it might add information gathered by watching the user via a video camera or by scrutinizing his/her calendar. Most probably, such an agent would be based on a Bayesian statistical model -capable of evaluating hundreds of user-related factors linked by probabilities, causes and effects in a vast web of contingent outcomes -that infers the likelihood that a given decision on the software's part would lead to the user's desired outcome. The ultimate goal is to judge when the user can safely be interrupted, with what kind of message, and via which device. Perhaps the same agent could serve as a travel agent by searching the Internet and gathering all the relevant information about airline schedules and hotel prices, and, with the user's consent, returning with the electronic tickets.
