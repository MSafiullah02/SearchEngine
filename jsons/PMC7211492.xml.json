Unfortunately, 33,830 cases have been confirmed besides China, including 7513 cases in South Korea, 9172 cases in Italy and 8042 cases in Iran. Although control measures have been applied to prevent further spread in China, including isolation of people suspected to have the disease, the need for better diagnosis and treatment of patients with pneumonia is no longer limited to China now, especially with the increasing numbers of infected patients worldwide, especially in South Korea, Italy and Iran. So far, several studies have described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 [7\u201310]; however, the clinical characteristics of patients remain indistinct due to the rarity of reported samples.",

In terms of clinical classification, 116 (59.79%) patients were mild type, 41 (21.13%) patients were moderate type, 25 (12.89%) patients were severe type and 12 patients (6.19%) were critically ill type. During the diagnostic procedure by nucleic acid tests, we found that 112 patients (57.73%) got a positive result in the first test, 45 patients (23.30%) got a positive result in the second test, 33 patients (17.01%) got a positive result in the third test, and 3 patients (1.55%) got a positive result in the fourth test. Surprisingly, another patient (0.51%) remained negative until the fifth test (Table 1). The most common symptoms were fever, sore throat and cough, which accounted for 146 cases (75.26%), 98 (50.52%) and 86 cases (44.33%), respectively. 71 cases (36.60%) had shortness of breath. In addition, 44 (22.68%) patients had muscle ache, 33 patients (17.10%) had headache, and 36 patients (18.56%) had diarrhea symptoms. Unfortunately, nine patients (4.64%) died.",

However, we found that the ACE2 protein levels were up-regulated in severe type and critically ill type compared with the adjacent normal tissue of lung, especially in critically ill type. This result demonstrates that ACE2 may be the receptor of COVID-19. Recently, Hoffmann et al. reported that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor [22]. They also reveal the important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention, because there is no specific drug for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 now.",
