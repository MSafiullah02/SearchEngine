            "text": "Inflammation has been historically considered as an obligatory marker of arterial disease. Cholesterol itself is an inflammatory mediator, being a crystalline product (1) and, by its physical presence, activating NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3), a general mediator of arterial tissue inflammation (2). NLRP3 nucleates the assembly of an inflammasome, leading to caspase 1-mediated activation of the interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) family of cytokines, thus inducing an inflammatory pyroptotic cell death (3). This molecular mechanism is the final development of the seminal idea by Ross and Glomset, who postulated endothelial injury as the inducer of cell proliferation and expansion of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (4,5). The association between local inflammation, elevated levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and noxious life habits brought forward the concept of structural lipoprotein changes allowing aggregation and/or oxidation (6). The presently established role of enhanced myelopoiesis in the development of arterial inflammatory changes and the identification of newer mediators from both inflammatory and immune systems can provide novel mechanisms underlying the development of arterial disease.",

            "text": "As a lipid-driven inflammatory disease, a balance of proinflammatory and inflammation-resolving mechanisms are responsible for the final outcomes (7). While bone marrow (BM) and spleen were not considered to play a significant role in atheroma formation, it is now well established that BM is responsible for the enhanced myelopoiesis, allowing recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly monocytes, to the arterial intima (8,9). The rise of hematopoietic and progenitor cells (HSPCs) occurring after myocardial infarction (MI) (10) can well explain the increased growth of plaques and the associated higher protease activity. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), in addition to eliciting effects through inflammatory mediators, reduces the epigenetic modifier enzyme ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) raising atherosclerotic risk (11). TET2 deficient cells, when clonally expanded, markedly increase plaque size and NLRP3 inflammasome mediated IL-1\u03b2 secretion (12). Further, toll like receptors, in particular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (13) by interacting with myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) can lead to cellular signaling, resulting in hematopoietic and stromal cell development (14). Hypercholesterolemia causes HSPCs to proliferate, leading to leukocytosis and enhanced atherosclerosis both in animal models and humans (15). As very recently described by Gu and colleagues (16), in the zebrafish deficient in the cholesterol efflux pathway mediated by apolipoprotein binding protein 2 there is a loss of capacity of HDL to accept cholesterol and increased hematopoiesis by way of Notch signaling, hypothesizing a cholesterol metabolism pathway controlling emergence of HSPCs. These findings have postulated a role of the NOTCH family in the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (17). Further, the reported novel roles of apolipoprotein binding protein 2 and of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) (17) have clearly indicated the presence of SREBP2 binding DNA sequences in Notch as well as in genes regulating cholesterol synthesis, most likely relevant in adult hematopoiesis (16).",

NLRC5 has an essential role in determining vascular intimal hyperplasia (22) and NLRC5 knock-out (Nlrc5-/) mice exhibit more severe intimal hyperplasia compared to wild-type mice after carotid ligation. NLRC5 deficiency leads to increased proliferation and migration of human vascular SMC.

Studies on the role of factor H and FHR1 in cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis and atherosclerosis have provided exciting openings on the role of FHR1 in the activation of monocyte inflammasomes. FHR1 appears to bind necrotic cells in plaques, in addition inducing inflammasome NLRP3 in blood derived monocytes that subsequently secrete interleukin (IL)1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, IL-18 and IL-6 (27).

In order to assess the critical value of LDL-C vs hsCRP, a crucial study was that by Penson et al on Reasons for Geographical and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) (46). In this, the relationship between low LDL-C (<70 mg/dL) compared to >70 mg/dl and hsCRP < 2 compared with \u22652 mg/L was evaluated. The Authors concluded that participants with high LDL-C and low hsCRP have a lower risk of stroke, CHD and CHD deaths compared to those in the same LDL-C category but with high hsCRP.

Among chronic kidney disease patients, canakinumab reduced the risk of MACEs by 18% with the highest benefit for those achieving on-treatment hsCRP levels below 2 mg/L (-32%) (62).

The trial was stopped since methotrexate did not result in the lowering of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 or hsCRP vs placebo. The primary endpoint occurred in 201 patients in the methotrexate and 207 in the placebo group (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.16). Methotrexate treatment was associated with raised liver enzymes, reduction in leukocytes and hematocrit and a higher incidence of non-basal cell skin cancer vs placebo (63). The different patient selection may explain the divergent results: in the CANTOS study patients were selected based on elevated hsCRP levels, whereas CIRT included patients with relatively normal inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP = 1.6 mg/L), poorly modified by treatment (64).",

This supports the observation that PCSK9 antagonists do not exert a significant anti-inflammatory activity. As previously reviewed by our group (117), although there is no impact on hsCRP, the application of this biomarker identifies patients with a high CV risk achieving better ASCVD prevention after PCSK9 inhibition. In the FOURIER study, even in patients with extremely low levels of LDL-C, there was a stepwise risk increment according to baseline hsCRP: +9% (<1 mg/L), +10.8% (1-3 mg/L) and +13.1% (>3 mg/L) (118). The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES with alirocumab showed no absolute changes for hsCRP although baseline hsCRP levels did identify subjects at higher risk (119). The debate on whether or not LDL-C and hsCRP are inseparable risk markers of risk was addressed in a post hoc analysis of the SPIRE-1 and -2 (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Reduction of Vascular Events) trials, with bococizumab. This latter led to a dramatic reduction in LDL-C, but when patients were stratified according to on-treatment hsCRP levels, i.e. <1 (reference value), 1-3, and >3 mg/L, HRs were 1, 1.16 (95%CI 0.81-1.66) and 1.62 (95%CI 1.14-2.30) (120) (Table 3\n).",

They were randomized to apabetalone (100 mg b.i.d.) or a matching placebo (130).

More patients allocated to apabetalone interrupted treatment (9.4 vs 5.7% for the placebo group) for reasons including elevation of liver enzyme activities. Plasma lipid and biomarker changes were of a modest degree: there were no statistically significant differences in LDL-C levels, hsCRP and HbA1c. At week 24, mean HDL-C levels rose from a mean of 33 mg/dL to 38.0 mg/dL with apabetalone and to 36.6 mg/dL with placebo (131).

AngII treatment in rodents elevates BP and VCAM-1; chemokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) are up-regulated in the aortas of Ang II-treated mice. In these animals, enalapril treatment reduces atherosclerosis, but in particular, vascular inflammation, by markedly reducing elevated chemokine levels (143). A direct clinical comparison of a major ACE-inhibitor, ramipril, with the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan, in type 2 diabetics, showed that both exerted a similar anti-inflammatory activity, as evaluated from a fall of hsCRP (144). The mechanisms of the proinflammatory activity of ACE activation and its inhibition by ACE inhibitors have been extensively investigated. ACE stimulation enhances the expression of inducible NO synthase and COX-2 by NF-\u03baB activation (145), also raising the production of reactive oxygen species and of proinflammatory T cells. ACE-Inhibition suppresses Th17- and Th1-mediated autoimmunity, also promoting production of Treg, favorably modulating inflammation (146). Ang II may also activate the TLR4 signaling pathway, leading to inflammatory synergism. These proinflammatory cytokines enhance the abnormal serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thus causing insulin resistance (147). Treatment with ACE-inhibitors will rescue insulin-resistance and, in some cases even cause hypoglycemia (148).",

The Val-MARC study in the US compared valsartan vs valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage 2 hypertension (152).

Nicardipine has been shown to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with essential hypertension (159) and to raise coronary vascular responses to acetylcholine.

Two groups of incretin hormones, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and, in the case of GIP, reduce gastric acid secretion. Incretin hormone secretion can be activated by inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 (185). The rapid degradation of GLP-1 and GIP by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV) has led to the development of two new classes of incretin-based drugs, i.e. GLP-1R agonists and DPP-IV inhibitors (186). GLP-1R agonists include liraglutide, exenatide, lixisenatide and albiglutide; DPP-IV inhibitors target degradation systems of incretin hormones and include sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin and alogliptin (187).

In the CANTATA-SU Study (204), with canagliflozin, there was a 22% reduction of IL-6 and a slight reduction of hsCRP (-4.4%). Conversely, a 7% increase in TNF-\u03b1 was detected after canagliflozin vs glimepiride (Table 4\n). Overall the effects on inflammatory markers are very modest and probably not contributing to the CV outcomes.",

Alterations of the microbiome, however, may be associated with multiple disorders including a raised prevalence of atherosclerotic diseases (206). Among the best-studied mechanisms underlying this association is the increase of circulating trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) derived from the metabolism of choline and carnitine by gut microbiome (207). More recently the same authors indicated that the precursor trimethylysine is also associated with adverse cardiac risk and the two together provide the best risk estimate (208). Contrasting data have been reported in an animal model: in the apoE-/- mice, Collins et al. (209) found that carnitine fed animals have raised TMAO levels but these are inversely related to aortic lesion formation. In the same model, mice fed chow or Western diet and low or no choline supplement showed raised plasma TMAO levels in the latter group in conventional (not germ free) mice. Choline treatment did not affect aortic lesion size or plasma cholesterol and there was no difference in glycoprotein CD68 in macrophages. Similarly, no clear inflammatory related responses of microbiota to choline could be found, following evaluation of 10 cytokines in plasma from apo E-/- mice (210). There is, however, clear evidence for a wide dispersion of baseline data in the clinical studies (211). In order to improve prediction, very recently Cassambai et al (212) suggested a choline loading test (700 mg oral choline bitartrate) followed by oral determinations for 8 hours, indeed showing clear interindividual differences.",

LA is converted after a series of steps to \u03b3-linolenic acid, dihomo-\u03b3-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid (ARA) (222). This last is the major precursor of eicosanoids, being converted by cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) to prostaglandins/thromboxanes. Concentrations of ARA-derived eicosanoids are elevated in inflammatory conditions. Pathways to ARA synthesis from LA is generally saturated in the presence of a high LA intake in humans (likely to be around 10 g/d) and thus raised LA intake will have no further effect in promoting ARA synthesis. This generally leads to unchanged levels of ARA in circulating mononuclear cells (MCs), and it is unlikely to see much of a change in inflammatory markers following raised dietary LA in individuals on a normal diet (223).",

From the results of a number of randomized controlled trials, the anti-inflammatory effect of omega-3 PUFA was associated to a reduction of hsCRP, IL-6 and TNF (230).

By these mechanisms, omega-3 PUFA and especially DHA decrease expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 on the surface of endothelial cells and monocyte cultures, as well as of scavenger receptor A in rats fed a high fat fish oil diet (234).",
