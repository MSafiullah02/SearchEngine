D. immitis often interferes with heart function and blood circulation and may damage other vital organs. Fertile female worms release microfilariae into the circulation, and microscopic detection of this larval stage in the blood is a common method used to diagnose heartworm disease. The accuracy and sensitivity of microscopic diagnostic methods are limited by several factors. First, D. immitis infections may occur without subsequent production of microfilariae. These occult infections may be caused by immune-mediated or drug-induced worm sterility, as well as single-sex, prepatent, or ectopic infections. In addition, the presence of morphologically similar microfilariae (Dipetalonema reconditum) may result in misdiagnosis. Furthermore, microfilarial counts are influenced by the diurnal rhythm of the microfilariae, the volume of blood examined, and the skill of the examiner.",

The assay is constructed such that specific antibody is sandwiched between two antigens, one immobilized and one labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRPO). Positive and negative controls are integrated into the assay. The SNAP ELISA was compared with the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and WB for the detection of L. infantum antibodies in dogs (Ferroglio et al., 2007). SNAP sensitivity and specificity compared to IFA were 91.1% and 99.2% and compared to WB were 93.4% and 98.3%, respectively.

This pestivirus is antigenically similar to bovine viral diarrhea virus and border disease virus. CSFV causes serious losses in the pig industry since it is highly pathogenic and can cause widespread deaths. Pigs infected with highly virulent CSFV strains may shed a large amount of virus before showing clinical signs of the disease such as fever, depression and loss of appetite. The primary lesion is generalized vasculitis (Kosmidou et al., 1995) manifested in live pigs as hemorrhages in the skin. Animals that survive an acute or subacute infection develop antibodies and will no longer spread the virus. Moderately virulent, less pathogenic strains may lead to chronic infection, when pigs excrete the virus continuously or intermittently until death. Congenital infection can result in abortion, fetal mummification, stillborn, and/or weak piglets from embryonic malformations.",

It is one of the most important pathogenic viruses in cattle, causing considerable losses in the dairy and beef industries worldwide. The virus crosses the placenta in infected, pregnant cows causing reproductive losses due to abortions, stillborn calves or calves that die early in life. When this infection occurs between ~45 and ~120 days of gestation, the calves that survive are immunotolerant to the virus and are persistently infected (PI), excreting large amounts of virus, thus perpetuating infection in herds. It is important to identify these PI animals to break the cycle of infection.

Clinical manifestations include nervousness, lack of co-ordination, loss of body weight, and ultimately death. These degenerative disorders of the brain and central nervous system are caused not by viruses or bacteria, but by infectious proteins called prions. Transmission in cattle is believed to occur via ingestion of food containing infectious prions followed by replication and subsequent migration to the central nervous system. Atypical forms of scrapie and BSE have been described (Baron et al., 2007, Seuberlich et al., 2010). Studies indicate these prion forms may be spontaneous in origin, similar to sporadic prion disease in humans. Atypical ruminate TSEs have been shown to be infectious.",

Importantly, infected cattle can become infectious long before they exhibit any obvious clinical signs of TB detectable even with the most careful veterinary examination. Even if present, the clinical signs of TB in cattle are not pathognomonic. As a result, effective ante-mortem surveillance for bovine TB must primarily rely on the detection of infected cattle at an early stage by the use of sensitive immunodiagnostic tests (Adams, 2001, Anon, 2004, De la Rua-Domenech, 2006).

To achieve high specificity, each kit incorporates two unique immunoaffinity-purified sheep antibodies; one pair is specific for canine and a second pair is specific for feline NT proBNP. If present in the sample, NT proBNP binds to the capture antibody pre-coated on the wells and forms a sandwich with the detection or conjugated antibody. After a washing step, substrate (TMB) is added to the wells and bound NT proBNP is quantified by an enzyme-catalyzed color change, detectable using a standard ELISA plate reader. A standard curve is plotted using the calibrator values, and the concentration of NT proBNP in samples is calculated from this curve. Results should be interpreted along with other clinical and diagnostic information. Separate kits are made for canine and feline applications because the NT proBNP protein sequences and reference ranges are different for each species.",

Potential uses include verification of estrus, monitoring of the estrus cycle and screening for ovarian dysfunction. There are limitations for using progesterone levels to determine pregnancy status. The test can only be used if the AI or breeding date is known because the sampling date is critical. Measurement of progesterone should occur between 21 and 24 days post AI to align with decreased progesterone levels in an open cow\u2019s estrous cycle. Low progesterone levels at this stage cannot support a pregnancy. Progesterone testing can be very accurate for identifying open animals. Higher progesterone test results are difficult to interpret because of variability in estrous cycle duration, embryonic loss and other conditions. In addition a cow that was bred, while not in heat, may have a high progesterone level even though the animal is not pregnant.",
