The lateral half of the canal is cartilaginous; the medial half tunnels through the temporal bone. A constriction, the isthmus, present at the juncture of the osseous and cartilaginous portions, limits the entry of wax and foreign bodies to the area near the tympanic membrane. The skin of the canal is thicker in the cartilaginous portion and includes a well-developed dermis and subcutaneous layer. The skin lining the osseous portion is thinner and firmly attached to the periosteum and lacks a subcutaneous layer. Hair follicles are numerous in the outer third and sparse in the inner two thirds of the canal. Cerumen and debris from epithelial cells accumulate in the canal and are extruded by normal cleansing mechanisms. On occasion, the material may become inspissated and obstruct the canal.",

Severe pain and tenderness of the tissues around the ear and mastoid are accompanied by the drainage of pus from the canal. Older, diabetic, immunocompromised, and debilitated patients are at particular risk. Life-threatening disease may result from spread to the temporal bone and then on to the sigmoid sinus, jugular bulb, base of the skull, meninges, and brain. Permanent facial paralysis is frequent, and cranial nerves 9, 10, and 12 may also be affected.10\nP. aeruginosa is almost always the causative agent (see Chapter 221). The extent of damage to soft tissue and bone may be identified and monitored by the use of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.3 Diagnostic tests for underlying disease should be instituted. The canal should be cleansed, devitalized tissue removed, and eardrops with antipseudomonal antibiotics combined with steroid instilled into the external auditory canal. Systemic therapy with regimens including activity for Pseudomonas spp. should be used for 4 to 6 weeks. The combination of ceftazidime, cefepime, or piperacillin with an aminoglycoside (gentamicin or tobramycin) should be considered.10 Oral quinolones with activity against Pseudomonas spp., such as ciprofloxacin, have been effective therapy early in the course of invasive external otitis.11\n",

For children in large-group daycare, almost one episode of respiratory tract infections a month occurs during the first year of life, and AOM is a complication in about one third to one half of respiratory tract infections.23 Children in daycare not only have more episodes of AOM than children in home care but have more severe disease, as measured by the need for more surgical procedures. A study of Pittsburgh children observed from birth through the second year of life noted that myringotomy and tympanostomy tube placements were performed in 21% of children in group daycare and in only 3% of children in home care.24 Exposure to tobacco smoke documented by measuring a nicotine metabolite, cotinine, in saliva and urine, correlated with an increased incidence of new episodes of OME and the duration of effusion.25 Kim and co-workers26 have identified an association of invasive pneumococcal disease and otitis media with atmospheric conditions, air pollution (identified by levels of sulfur dioxide), and the isolation of respiratory viruses.",

The eustachian tube has at least three physiologic functions with respect to the middle ear: protection of the ear from nasopharyngeal secretions, drainage into the nasopharynx of secretions produced within the middle ear, and ventilation of the middle ear to equilibrate air pressure with that in the external ear canal. When one or more of these functions is compromised, the results may be the development of fluid and infection in the middle ear. Most episodes of AOM occur in the following sequence: congestion of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, often caused by a respiratory viral infection; swelling of the mucosa of the eustachian tube, progressing to obstruction of the tube at its narrowest section, the isthmus; secretions that are constantly formed by the mucosa of the middle ear accumulate behind the obstruction and if a bacterial pathogen is present, AOM may result. The pathogenesis of fluid that persists for weeks to months after episodes of adequately treated AOM or persistent OME remains uncertain. Recent studies have suggested that bacterial biofilms on the middle ear mucosa may play a role in chronic OME or OME.27\n",

Otitis media caused by H. influenzae is associated with nontypeable strains in the vast majority of patients. In approximately 10% of cases, the otitis was caused by H. influenzae type B and was frequently severe and accompanied by bacteremia or meningitis. Type B is now rare because of the efficacy of the conjugate polysaccharide vaccine.

The motion of the tympanic membrane is proportional to the pressure applied by gently squeezing and then releasing the rubber bulb attached to the head of the otoscope. Normal mobility is apparent when positive pressure is applied and the tympanic membrane moves rapidly inward; with release of the bulb and the resulting negative pressure, the membrane moves outward. Fluid or high negative pressure in the middle ear dampens the mobility of the tympanic membrane. Adjunctive techniques are available to confirm the results of otoscopic examinations and assist in the accuracy of diagnosis. Tympanometry uses an electroacoustic impedance bridge to record compliance of the tympanic membrane and middle ear pressure. This technique presents objective evidence of the status of the middle ear and the presence or absence of fluid.49 Acoustic reflectometry measures sound reflectivity from the middle ear and is able to distinguish an air- or fluid-filled space. Spatial gradient analysis is correlated with the probability of middle ear effusion in children.50 In addition to a professional model, a consumer model (Innovia Medical, Omaha, NE) is available that permits home monitoring of the development or persistence of middle ear fluid.",

Bacteriologic efficacy of PCV7 was evaluated for prevention of AOM in Finnish infants.69 Bacteriologic diagnosis was based on aspiration of middle ear fluids in patients with AOM who had completed the infant three-dose schedule (Table 62-2\n). Similar to a study in northern California, the vaccine reduced the incidence of AOM by 6%. The reduction in number of episodes of pneumococcal AOM was 34%, but the reduction in episodes caused by vaccine serotype disease was 57%. Of concern were increases in the number of episodes of AOM caused by nonvaccine organisms in children who received PCV7, a 33% increase in nonvaccine serotype pneumococcal AOM, and an 11% increase in episodes caused by H. influenzae. These data suggested that the vaccine was successful in reducing carriage of vaccine serotypes but that pneumococcal carriage was replenished with nonvaccine serotypes, which subsequently spread from the upper respiratory tract to the middle ear to cause AOM.

They are placed through an incision in the tympanic membrane to provide drainage of fluid and ventilation of the middle ear. The placement of these tubes is now one of the most common surgical procedures in children. Criteria for the placement of tubes include persistent middle ear effusions unresponsive to adequate medical treatment over a period of 3 months and persistent negative pressure. Hearing improves dramatically after placement of the ventilating tubes. The tubes have also been of value in patients who have difficulty maintaining ambient pressure in the middle ear, such as occurs because of barotrauma in airline personnel. The liabilities of the placement of tubes include those of anesthesia associated with the procedure, persistent perforation, scarring of the tympanic membrane, development of cholesteatoma, and otitis media caused by swimming with ventilating tubes in place, but these occur infrequently.",
