This risk may arise from trends such as improvements in mortality that continue to be greater than expected, or the risk may be from a shock such as a catastrophic mortality event, which causes an unexpected increase in mortality. The latter in particular poses a significant threat to the life insurance industry due to the potential for a substantial rise in claims over a short period of time. As a result, severe adverse financial consequences can potentially arise, such as breaches in regulatory solvency and capital requirements (Cox and Hu, 2004).",

Potential associated nonmortality risks are discussed in order to place the impact of increased mortality within a context of wider risks to the business. Risk mitigation strategies, both traditional and more recent, are also discussed.",

For example, the 1918\u20131919 Spanish Flu involved three successive waves of infection within 1 year. The first wave began in March 1918 and caused high morbidity11 but relatively low mortality. An exceptionally virulent second wave of infection followed in August 1918, which caused significant mortality. In many countries, a third wave with a level of impact between the first and second waves occurred in early 1919. It is believed that all major populations of the world were affected within 10 months (Nguyen\u2010Van\u2010Tam and Hampson, 2003); however, this pattern was not universal among all countries (Patterson and Pyle, 1991).

This means that influenza\u2010related deaths are often attributed to complications that occur after the initial infection of influenza (Simonsen et al., 1997) and as such, influenza may not be listed as a cause on the death certificate for many influenza\u2010related deaths (Woolnough et al., 2007).

The mortality index is defined over a 2\u2010calendar\u2010year period24 and calculated using general population mortality rates published by official public reporting sources weighted by age and gender (Rooney, 2008). The weights are specified by the sponsor to broadly reflect their exposure to an insured population and are fixed throughout the duration of the risk period25 (Standard & Poor's, 2011).

Second, the issue of basis risk exists for catastrophic mortality bonds since the payoff trigger is index based and the actual loss suffered is unlikely to be perfectly matched by the bond payoff. This contrasts with traditional reinsurance, which has no basis risk since it is indemnity based and provides full coverage for reinsured losses (Hartwig et al., 2008). Third, the capital credit given by regulators and rating agencies may be reduced for catastrophic mortality bonds in comparison to traditional reinsurance (Standard & Poor's, 2008). Finally, the terms of catastrophic mortality bonds are fixed throughout the duration of coverage while traditional reinsurance can be adjusted every year allowing for short\u2010term commitment and flexibility (PartnerRe, 2008).",
