In fact, most pre-and postoperative visits were conducted remotely and virtually. Based on statistics from \"Neurosurgery News,\" one of the national continuing education platforms for neurosurgeons, more than 40 national online outpatient question-and-answer sessions and 39 cloud seminars have been hosted in the past month, some of which were transmitted through 5G technology. These virtual visits and online seminars have attracted more than 280,000 patients and 1000 neurosurgical professionals. Meanwhile, doctor-patient disputes and hospital violence in China, which had previously been of wide concern, 5,6 seem to have significantly improved in the context of COVID-19. We may actually see the silver lining that the mindsets of both healthcare providers and patients are changed after the pandemic ends.",
