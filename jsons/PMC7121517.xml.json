These threats often go beyond or transcend borders and may be caused by infectious agents that emerge naturally at the human/animal interface, but they may also be caused by chemicals, toxins and radiation, or be deliberately caused by acts of terrorism. The steady and increasing rise in non-communicable diseases also constitutes a threat to societal health security. Moreover, reducing vulnerability means, not only combating the disease threats themselves but also addressing their determinants, some of which may also transcend borders, such as international trade and other economic policies that influence the emergence and spread of disease.",

Governance and policies in sectors outside health, such as agriculture, trade, finance, national security or defence, can have significant effects on health outcomes. Likewise, action aimed at improving health security can affect other sectors. For these reasons, when health security issues involve trans-border events and become international, they can encounter serious difficulties in bilateral relations, at international organizations and in diplomatic negotiations because of a divergence of political, economic or social interests among states, and between states and non-state actors. As examples: efforts to combat counterfeit, falsified and substandard medicines\u2014which pose a significant danger to health\u2014have been hampered by the lack of a consensus definition of counterfeit as it pertains to medicines. This in turn risks becoming embroiled in controversy over which institutions should have how much authority over the problem because issues other than health protection, such as trade, intellectual property and the fight against organized crime, are also at stake. To enable medicines and vaccines to reach those who need them, it is often necessary to address barriers such as trade, regulations and intellectual property rights. Responses to the threat or consequences of chemical and biological terrorism must involve not only public health but also national and international security and crime prevention agencies.",

SARS clearly demonstrated the characteristics of infectious diseases that make outbreaks a security threat; a symptom-less incubation period which allows the pathogen to spread undetected, the rapid spread made possible by air travel and the public concern heightened by access to immediate information through electronic communication methods (Heymann and Rodier 2004). The rapid global spread of SARS also made it clear that public health can no longer be viewed as a domestic concern by any one country but needs to be incorporated into foreign policy (Chan et al. 2010). The epidemic has prompted much discussion on the relationship between infectious diseases and non-traditional security issues and emphasizes the need for a balanced focus on both economic growth and the building of a robust social infrastructure.",

Such measures to increase health security require investment and are issues where health and other sectors, including agriculture, trade, and transportation, must work together both nationally through enforceable regulation and internationally through diplomacy that leads to agreed international norms and regulations.

But in 2001, the report of the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health made the case for investments in health as a contributor to economic growth (WHO 2001), using examples such as malaria, which is estimated to kill 1 million children under the age of 5 each year, and to cost sub-Saharan Africa at least $12 billion annually. Together with other studies, and discussions through the G8 and other diplomatic fora, the Commission provided justification for action to improve access to medicines, both in targeted multilateral and bilateral development support, for several high mortality infectious diseases for which no effective vacciness exist. The result has been the creation of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (The Global Fund), with increasing multilateral funding, and UNITAID, which provides funding for the purchase of medicines through an innovative tax levy on international air tickets. Bilaterally, funding has increased for the purchase of medicine through such programmes as the President\u2019s Emergency Relief Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative (PMI), which also provide funds to strengthen health systems (PMI 2005). funds and initiatives such as these have addressed the health security needs for three infectious diseases\u2014AIDS, TB and malaria and through the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), provide newer vaccines for childhood diseases. It remains to be seen whether the Global Fund, GAVI and UNITAID are sustainable and able to meet increasing needs and challenges in the long term, or whether other, more sustainable mechanisms that are less reliant on donor must be developed.",

Substandard medicines are those that do not meet national regulatory standards of quality, efficacy and safety and can be substandard either unintentionally or deliberately. The latter category includes drugs that have been produced outside the legitimate supply chain\u2014that have not been submitted to regulators, that misrepresent themselves as to use, identity or source, or pass themselves off as brand name medicines (using counterfeit trademarks). Globalization, through a widening of the drug-manufacturing base, has created threats for the legal supply chain, but also facilitates opportunities for the production of illegitimate medicines. The challenge can be illustrated in the finding that in Southeast Asia in 2007, one in two tablets of artenusate, an anti-malarial drug, were substandard, some with counterfeit trademarks, others falsified or fake in other aspects (Newton et al. 2008). Responses to substandard medicines include strengthening of national regulatory agencies and enforcement, and a criminal response that crosses international borders, involving law enforcement and multilateral support from agencies such as INTERPOL.",

In post-conflict situations, the challenge is amplified by controversies regarding the legitimacy of warring forces, NGOs and donors in providing such services, but successes do occur.

The Declaration defined national health security as relating to \u201cdefence against internal and external public-health risks and threats\u201d, making reference not only to protection against trans-border infectious disease risks, but also to ensuring access to medicines and health services. It regarded global health security as an area that encompassed diplomacy, governance, development, poverty, trade, conflict and disaster preparedness and response, and the ministers pledged to integrate health impact assessments into key elements of their foreign policy and development strategies. In this sense, the economic and security focus of foreign policy become concerns for global health, and the focus of global health becomes a concern for the economic and security concerns of foreign policy.

But experiences in post-conflict countries have underscored the importance of delivering health assistance and rebuilding health sector capabilities as a key part of recovery from conflict. Health sector investments are viewed by some as a bridge to peace; a form of diplomacy aimed to build trust between communities and actors. This is currently played out by a variety of actors, such as the NATO sponsored International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, where strengthening national health services is one of its priorities.

Work must be done to develop sustainable financing mechanisms suitable for high-volume, low-margin markets to improve access in as many developing countries as possible, while ensuring that substandard medicines and vaccines can be detected and kept to a minimum. The High Level Taskforce on Innovative Financing for Health in the United Kingdom came to the conclusion that the bulk of long-term funding of health systems, which are necessary to support efforts to improve health security, had to come from domestic mobilization (Fryatt et al. 2010). Both technical and political skills will be necessary to accomplish these goals and to strengthen and maintain global health security.",
