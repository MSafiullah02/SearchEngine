There are also associated complications, which should be recognized in order to make correct decisions regarding interventions or management. Clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecific, especially in infants and younger children. Some children with pneumonia even present with nonrespiratory symptoms including fever, malaise, decreased appetite, irritability, weakness, chest pain, and abdominal symptoms. Physical examination is also less reliable in children than adults (Donnelly 2001). Microbiological tests are important but could be difficult to obtain especially in younger children. Various medical imaging modalities not only play an important role as an aid in diagnosis but can also help during and after therapy. Diagnosis of pneumonia calls for a combination of clinical awareness, appropriate microbiological tests, and radiological studies.",

            "text": "The cause of pneumonia in a child is often difficult to identify, but the patient\u2019s age can help narrow the possible etiologies. Viral pneumonia is rare in the neonatal period because of conferred maternal antibody protection. Group B streptococcus and Gram-negative enteric bacteria are the most common pathogen in neonates (birth to 20 days), obtained through vertical transmission from the mother during birth. From age 3 weeks to 3 months, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen. Viruses are the most frequent cause of community-acquired pneumonia in infants older than 4 months and in preschool-aged children, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most common. For school-aged children (6\u201316 years old), the incidence of bacterial infections from Streptococcus increases, although viral disease remains the most common cause (Condon 1991; Ostapchuk et al. 2004). Bacterial pneumonia can occur at any time in preschool and school-aged children and adolescents. Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes 30 % of lower respiratory tract infections in school-aged children (Condon 1991; Donnelly 2001). Infectious agents causing pneumonia are not limited to viruses and bacteria, but it could also be due to Mycobacteria, fungi, protozoa, and parasites. Co-infection with two or more microbial agents can also occur.",

The radiographic appearance reflects the pathologic process occurring in the respiratory system (Bramson et al. 2005). Frontal and lateral views are obtained when possible because hyperinflation and lymphadenopathy are more accurately evaluated on a lateral radiograph especially in younger children. Lateral decubitus views may be useful in distinguishing free flowing pleural fluid versus loculated fluid collections. Chest radiographs have inherent limitations, but despite of this, there is moderate evidence to suggest that chest radiographs are sufficiently sensitive and highly specific for the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (Westra and Choy 2009).",

CT has an important role when a complication is suspected, to exclude an underlying abnormality in recurrent and persistent infections, for image-guided interventions, and for the evaluation of immunocompromised children (Westra and Choy 2009). Radiation-associated risks are important to consider, and thus, a clear indication for the procedure has to be present.

It is particularly associated with Adenovirus, RSV, Varicella, and severe Mycoplasma infection. The chest x-ray findings are often nonspecific and can appear normal, but the most common abnormality is hyperaeration (Yalcin et al. 2003). On HRCT, there is a mosaic perfusion pattern (Fig. 13.5). Perfusion is diminished in areas of parenchymal attenuation due to vasoconstriction secondary to hypoxia. Inspiratory and expiratory phases of ventilation are important in HRCT to better assess air trapping in this condition (Hansell et al. 1997). Peribronchial thickening, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, and sometimes lung volume reduction can also be seen. Swyer-James is a subtype of postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans, which is typically unilateral. It can affect one lung segment, a lobe, or the entire lung. The characteristic chest radiographic and CT findings are hyperlucency due to the pulmonary hypoperfusion, reduction of vascular and hilar markings, and volume reduction of the affected lung or lobe (Daltro et al. 2011) (Fig. 13.6).",

In ultrasound, pleural fluid can be characterized as simple effusion, complicated effusion, or fibrothorax (pleural thickening or fibrosis) (Fig. 13.9). A simple effusion appears as a clear anechoic or cloudy hypoechoic fluid with or without swirling particles. A complicated effusion appears as a septated or multiloculated, hypoechoic fluid with fibrinous septations, with no clear demarcation between the lung and pleural components, while a fibrothorax appears as a thickened, echogenic rind of pleural plaque (Kim et al. 2000).",

Disseminated histoplasmosis in children is characteristically a fulminant illness, which may or may not have pulmonary involvement. Radiologic manifestations parallel the clinical syndromes. Acute disease usually manifests as focal parenchymal consolidation with or without ipsilateral hilar adenopathy (Fig. 13.25). With healing, a nodule representing a histoplasmoma may result. Chronic histoplasmosis radiographically manifests as an upper lobe fibrocavitary disease indistinguishable from postprimary tuberculosis. Chest radiographs of patients with disseminated disease may show miliary or diffuse reticulonodular pattern that could progress to diffuse airspace opacification (McAdams et al. 1995).",

Ascaris infestation generally occurs through hand-to-mouth ingestion of food contaminated with parasite eggs, while hookworms are transmitted through larval penetration of the skin. Symptomatic pulmonary disease may present with fever, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and wheezing. These pulmonary symptoms could be due to Loffler\u2019s syndrome, effects of larval tissue migration, airway reactivity or bronchospasm, superimposed bacterial infection, and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (Sarinas and Chitkara 1997). Ascaris and hookworm infections present with peripheral eosinophilia during larval migration phase. Chest radiographs could be normal or demonstrate nonspecific patchy pulmonary infiltrates (Fig. 13.27).

Primary immunodeficiency can be broadly divided into T-cell (cellular) immune deficiency versus B cell (humoral deficiency). Humoral immunodeficiencies are the most commonly encountered type characterized by defective antibody production with increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections but able to recover from viral infections (Fig. 13.28). Examples are X-linked agammaglobulinemia, IgA deficiency, and common variable immunodeficiency. Cellular immunodeficiencies have increased susceptibility to disseminated viral and opportunistic infections. Cellular immune disorders include DiGeorge syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency (Collingsworth 2005).",

There is increased susceptibility to bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and opportunistic infections. Lobar or segmental consolidations are the most common patterns (Marks et al. 1996). Mycobacterial infection can be seen in AIDS patients, and the radiographic appearance mimics that seen in immunocompetent children with primary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare is also encountered later in the course of disease and imaging findings cannot be distinguished with other forms of mycobacterial infections (Collingsworth 2005). Pneumocystis jiroveci is the most common opportunistic pulmonary infection in children with AIDS, occurring in up to 50 %, and is the leading pulmonary cause of death (Jeanes and Owens 2002). Radiographic appearances are variable and include hyperinflation with diffuse bilateral interstitial or nodular infiltrates from the perihilar region to the periphery, which often progresses to widespread alveolar opacities with air bronchogram (Fig. 13.30). Cavitary nodules and cysts can be seen, with pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum as common complications. HRCT findings include patchy or diffuse ground-glass opacity, consolidation, cyst or cavities, centrilobular opacities, nodules, peribronchial cuffing, and interlobular septal thickening (Jeanes and Owens 2002; Collingsworth 2005).",
