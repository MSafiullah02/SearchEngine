In brief, all available MERS-CoV S sequences were downloaded from the GenBank database, and the dataset was filtered by removing sequences containing ambiguous amino acid codes (BJOUXZ). The final dataset was multiply aligned using CLUSTALW, the Shannon entropy for each position was determined, and the consensus S1 subunit sequence was obtained. The signal peptide from the MERS-CoV S protein was maintained at the N-terminus to secrete the fusion protein from rAd5-infected cells. The synthetic fusion gene was synthesized by linking the coding region of MERS-CoV S1 to a histidine tag coding sequence, followed by coding region for the fibritin trimerization motif [37] connected via a nonpolar amino acid linker to the ectodomain of CD40L (amino acids 117\u2013260) coding region to express the fusion protein S1/F/CD40L. The fusion gene was then used to generate the proposed rAd5 construct (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L) in addition to rAd5 vaccines expressing secreted and consensus S1 protein alone (rAd5-S1) and a vector control expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (rAd5-GFP) as shown in Figure 1.",

Here, we observed that both rAd5-S1/F/CD40L and rAd5-S1 induced S1-specific Abs from all isotypes in hDPP4 Tg+ mice after primary or secondary immunization (Figure 3). As expected, control vector (rAd5-GFP) failed to elicit any S1-specific Ab response. Notably, a single dose or 2 doses of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L consistently elicited significantly higher levels of total IgG as well as IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b isotypes compared with the control group immunized with rAd5-GFP (Figure 3), whereas immunization with a single dose of rAd5-S1 induced significant titers of total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a but not IgG2b compared to the control group, with a second dose of rAd5-S1 eventually inducing significantly higher levels of IgG2b compared to the control group. Interestingly, immunizing mice with a second dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L enhanced the levels of circulatory IgG and all tested isotypes compared with the rAd5-S1\u2013vaccinated group. Furthermore, 2 doses of rAd5-S1 only enhanced IgG2b significantly compared to 1 dose, with mean IgG1:IgG2a ratios being 3.8 (SD, 3.2) and 3.9 (SD, 3.2) after priming and boosting, respectively. In contrast, boosting with a second dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L resulted in a significant increase in total IgG, particularly in IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes but not IgG1, compared with a single dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L, suggesting a bias toward Th1 response as demonstrated by mean IgG1:IgG2a ratios of 3.4 (SD, 2.4) and 1.8 (SD, 1.4) after priming and boosting, respectively. Together, these data showed that targeting the secreted S1 to CD40-expressing APCs via CD40L (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L) not only enhanced S1-specific IgG Abs levels but also boosted Th1 responses, as demonstrated by markedly elevated titers of S1-specific IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies, especially after boosting.",

As expected, all immunized mice from all groups showed no detectable levels of nAbs in samples collected before immunization. As shown in Figure 4, a single dose of either rAd5-S1/F/CD40L or rAd5-S1 elicited high levels of nAbs compared to the control group (rAd5-GFP), with rAd5-S1/F/CD40L, but not rAd5-S1, being consistently capable of inducing significantly higher levels of nAbs against both live and pseudotyped MERS-CoV virus, suggesting that rAd5-S1/F/CD40L is better than rAd-S1 vaccine in promoting strong humoral response and neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. However, after boosting once, all rAd5-S1/F/CD40L\u2013 and rAd5-S1\u2013immunized animals elicited robust and significant levels of nAbs, indicating that at least 2 doses of rAd-S1 are required to induce nAb levels similar to those obtained by a single dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L. These findings clearly confirm that incorporation of CD40L as molecular adjuvant could effectively enhance the immunogenicity of S1-based vaccines and may represent a very promising vaccine platform to induce protective immunity with a single dose.",

It was clear that mice immunized twice with either rAd5-S1 or rAd5-S1/F/CD40L were completely protected based on clinical signs of disease (weight loss) and mortality (Figure 5), whereas rAd5-GFP\u2013immunized animals expectedly succumbed to lethal infection within days, likely due to encephalitis [28, 40]. These findings suggest that both rAd5-S1 and rAd5-S1/F/CD40L vaccines are protective in this mouse model.",

Surprisingly, although rAd5-S1 immunization protected animals from death and weight loss and prevented the lung infiltration similar to rAd5-S1/F/CD40L, we observed perivascular hemorrhage in the whole lung of all examined mice immunized with rAd5-S1 but not those vaccinated with rAd5-S1/F/CD40L (Figure 7). Together, these results suggest that although S1 alone could protect the animals from viral infection, it may inadvertently induce lung pathology, and that using CD40L as targeting molecule and molecular adjuvant does not only enhance immunogenicity and protective efficacy but also prevents vaccine-associated pulmonary pathology.",

Several groups have investigated various MERS-CoV vaccine platforms in several animal models [9\u201318, 28].

Importantly, both S1 and CD40-targeted S1 vaccines provided complete protection, prevented virus replication significantly, and prevented monocytic and lymphocytic lung infiltration as compared to control group. However, the non-CD40-targeted vaccine (rAd5-S1) uniformly induced varying degrees of severe perivascular hemorrhage within the lungs of all examined mice following viral challenge, regardless of the exhibited full protection against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. While these data suggest that there might be yet to be explained lung pathology associated with rAd5 vector\u2013 and/or MERS-CoV S1\u2013based vaccines, our results clearly show that including CD40L as a fusion protein of S1-based MERS-CoV vaccine could prevent or at least mitigate the safety concern of undesirable immunopathology while affording complete protection in hDPP4 Tg+ mice.",

However, these studies have mainly focused on the immunogenicity and/or the protective efficacy, and may have overlooked any possible vaccine-associated pathology, especially after viral challenge. Our finding that rAd5-S1 immunized animals were completely protected despite the observed pathology is reminiscent of the immunopathology documented using WIV for MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and respiratory syncytial virus after viral challenge [19\u201328, 43\u201345]. It is of note that lung pathology was also observed in some previous studies involving rhesus macaques immunized with high doses of DNA vaccines expressing MERS-CoV S protein [16], as well as in mouse models vaccinated with RBD or vectored vaccines encoding S protein [46\u201348]. Nevertheless, this is the first report of vaccine-associated severe pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage after viral challenge. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying such vaccine-induced pulmonary injury associated with rAd5-S1 vaccination remain to be determined, several factors could have been involved. Specifically, the likely higher levels of residual infectious viruses in rAd5-S1\u2013immunized mice as detected by RT-qPCR, and the quantitative and perhaps qualitative difference of specific antibody and T-cell responses, as evidenced by the lower levels of Ig2a and IgG2b found in this group, could have played a role. Therefore, future studies should include systematic analyses of T-cell responses as we have previously conducted [37, 38], to fully explore the mechanisms of immunization-induced hemorrhage of the lungs. Collectively, these previous data, along with our report here, indicate that viral components (ie, within the S protein) could be involved in inadvertent adverse reactions similar to those associated with the different S-based SARS vaccines [19\u201328].",
