Recent studies demonstrated that the incidence of severe or fatal M. pneumoniae was gradually increasing, which may be related to the excessive inflammation. However, the exact pathogenesis of excessive inflammation in Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia(MPP) is still unclear. This study aimed to reveal the role of miR-29c/B7-H3/Th17 axis in children with MPP. Methods: Children hospitalized in Respiratory Department during Jan. 2014 to Dec. 2015 were enrolled. All children enrolled was confirmed with MP infection using real-time PCR and ELISA. Children were excluded if they were coinfected with other pathogens. A total of 52 children with MPP and 26 controls were enrolled. miR-29c expression in monocytes of children with MPP was determined by real-time PCR and soluble B7-H3 (sB7-H3) and IL-17 were determined by ELISA, and explore their clinical significance. miR-29c overexpression and silencing technology and luciferase reporter assay were performed to confirm whether B7-H3 is the direct target of miR-29c. The levels of transcription factor ROR-\u03b3t in CD4+ T cells and cytokine IL-17A in supernatant were detected after stimulated by different concentrations of B7-H3 fusion protein in vitro.",

Nineteen cases had pleural effusion accounting for 36.5%. Children with MPP had significantly lower level of miR-29c and higher level of sB7-H3 and IL-17 compared to controls (both P < 0.05). The level of miR-29c significantly increased during convalescent phase compared to that of acute phase while sB7-H3 and IL-17 significantly decreased during convalescent phase (both P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the level of sB7-H3 and IL-17 in children with MPP during acute-stage (r = 0.361,P = 0.009). Children with MPP combined with pleural effusion had significantly higher level of sB7-H3 compared to those without pleural effusion (9952.3 \u00b1 3065.3 vs. 7449.7 \u00b1 2231.5, pg/ml), and the levels of sB7-H3 was positively correlated with the number of days of fever. The level of miR-29c was negatively correlated with M. pneumoniae specific IgG, IgM level. High concentrations of B7-H3(15\u03bcg/ml) could enhance ROR-\u03b3t expression and increase IL-17A. Functional studies based on luciferase reporter assay and immunofluorescence staining suggested that B7-H3 is the direct target of miR-29c, and miR-29c silencing or overexpression could up-or down-regulate the expression of B7-H3 in THP-1 cells.",

Imaging results were conducted using chest radiography, chest CT, and thoracic ultrasound. Laboratory specimens were obtained including peripheral blood, and nasopharyngeal aspirates. The following laboratory tests were conducted including blood routine, C-reactive-protein (CRP), biochemicalfunction, humoral-immunity, and lymphocyte subsets. A total of 26 controls with age matched were selected from children with elective surgery including inguinal hernia, multiple fingers deformity, and fracture fixation after internal fixation from surgery wards of Children's Hospital of Soochow University. All the controls enrolled in this study without history of infections, drugs allergy, family or personal allergy within 4 weeks. There was no significant difference in the age of children between MPP group and control group.

Both antigen or cleavage products of MP could induce high expression of IL-17A in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in mice [16, 17] , and they could stimulate proliferation of mouse lymphocytes and then secrete IL-17A by Th17 cells [4] . Taken together, these studies suggested that Th17 cells and IL-17 played an important role in MPP, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Several studies have shown that MP can stimulate alveolar macrophages produce IL-23, and then IL-23 induces IL-17 production in activated CD4 + T cells. In contrast, blocking of IL-23 alone resulted in a significant reduction of Mp-induced IL-17 in BALF of mice [17, 18] .

            "text": "It is now known that Th activation and differentiation require dual signal stimulation. Co-stimulatory molecules are a heterogenous group of cell surface molecules that act to amplify or counteract the initial activating signals provided to T cells from the T cell receptor (TCR) following its interaction with an antigen/major histocompatibility complex (MHC), thereby influencing T cell differentiation [19, 20] . Th activation and differentiation is associated with costimulatory molecules expressed on antigen presenting cell including B7 family molecules. Recently, Luo et al. evaluated the functions of B7-H3 in the regulation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, experimental asthma, and collagen-induced arthritis using B7-H3 deficient mouse (B7-H3 KO), it suggested that B7-H3 has function on Th1/Th17 and could enhance [20, 21] . This is consistent with our findings that B7-H3 plays an role in immunopathogenesis of children with MPP through regulating of Th17 differentiation and enhancing secretion IL-17.",

            "text": "In present study, we also demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between the levels of sB7-H3 and IL-17 in children with MPP. The gene expression of B7-H3 controlled by many factors including miRNAs. A previous study indicated that MicroRNA-187, down-regulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and associated with lower survival, inhibits cell growth and migration though targeting B7-H3 [21, 22] . There are 13 kinds of miRNAs that can target the regulation of B7-H3 in the breast cancer patients, and only miR-29c is associated with the prognosis of breast cancer patients [22, 23] . The aim of our study is to determine the level of sB7-H3 and IL-17 expression in children with MPP. The luciferase reporter assay were performed to confirm B7-H3 is the direct target of miR-29c. The gradual regulation in axis of miR-29c/ B7-H3/Th17 is confirmed in vitro, and the expression of miR-29c, sB7-H3, IL-17 during the acute and convalescent phase is consistent with the result in vitro. The association between sB7-H3 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was not statistically significant, but there was related trends. LDH has been confirmed to be associated with the severity of MPP, and LDH is an indicated marker for steroid therapy for MPP [23, 24] . However, there was no association between miR-29c and sB7-H3 in children with MPP, it is probably because there are other miRNAs to regulate B7-H3 expression except for miR-29c [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . It is interesting that the serum level of miR-29c expression was negatively correlated with the M. pneumoniae specific IgG and IgM level during the Fig. 3 Function of B7-H3 on CD4 + T cells to induce expression of ROR-\u03b3t and IL-17A. Different concentrations of B7-H3 fusion protein (0.6 \u03bcg / ml, 3 \u03bcg / ml and 15 \u03bcg / ml) or human IgG as control group co-cultured with CD4 + T cells for 24 h. The expression of transcription factor ROR-\u03b3t (a) and IL-17A (b) was detected by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant Fig. 4 B7-H3 is the target of miR-29c confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. a The binding site of miR-29c in the 3'UTR of the B7-H3 mRNA and the mutant sequence of 3'UTR of B7-H3 mRNA. b Luciferase activity in THP-1 cells transiently cotransfected with pLenti-miR-29c or empty vector and B7-H3-3'UTR reporter plasmid or B7-H3-3'UTR-Mut reporter plasmid. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM of 3 independent experiments acute phase, which suggested that children with low expression of miR-29c may have an excessive inflammatory immune response to MP infection. However the mechanism is require to explored.",
