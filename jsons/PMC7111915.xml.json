In addition to the replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and structural proteins (spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E)), which are common to all members of the genus coronavirus, the SARS-CoV genome also encodes eight putative proteins with no significant sequence homology to viral proteins of other known coronaviruses (i.e., open reading frames (ORFs) 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b) (Marra et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003, Tan et al., 2005). Although it was recently demonstrated that most of these so-called accessory proteins are not essential for viral replication in cell culture or in the murine model (Yount et al., 2005), the exact contributions of these proteins to viral replication or pathogenesis in the natural host have not been established.",

            "text": "Interestingly, epidemiological studies have revealed that the part of the viral genome that encodes for two of these accessory proteins, 8a and 8b, shows major variations. In one of these studies, Guan and co-workers (2003) analyzed SARS-CoV isolates obtained from animals in a live-market in Guangdong and found that all the animal isolates contain a 29-nucleotides (nt) sequence, which is absent in most of the human isolates (Fig. 1A). As a result of this, the ORF8a and ORF8b (also termed as ORF10 and ORF11, respectively) in the human isolates become one ORF, termed as ORF8ab. ORF8ab encodes a protein of 122 amino acids (aa), whose N terminus is identical to 8a and C terminus is identical to 8b (Fig. 1B). Another extensive study of 63 SARS-CoV isolates obtained from the SARS epidemic in China also showed that there are major variations in this region of the viral genome (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). In this study, the course of the epidemic was divided into the early, middle and late phase with the early phase defined as the period of first emergence of SARS in Guangdong Province. The middle phase referred to all events up to the first cluster of SARS cases in the Metropole hotel in Hong Kong and the late phase referred to all cases following this cluster. Interestingly, the clustering of patients with different patterns of variations in ORF8 region was correlated with the different phases of the epidemic. These findings were subsequently verified by researchers who studied the SARS-CoV isolated in different countries (Chiu et al., 2005, Lan et al., 2005, Qin et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2005).",

In order to understand how the changes in the ORF8 region of the viral genome may impact on viral replication or pathogenesis, we compared the cellular properties of the human SARS-CoV 8a and 8b proteins with their counterpart, 8ab, in animal SARS-CoV. Specific antibodies were produced and used to determine the expression of 8a and 8b in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Indirect immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to compare the cellular localization of the 8a, 8b and 8ab proteins and their abilities to interact with other SARS-CoV proteins. Finally, the specific effects of the 8b protein on the expression of the small structural protein E in cells co-expressing 8b and E, and in SARS-CoV-infected cells were demonstrated.",

To determine the specificity of these antibodies, Western blot analysis was performed to detect 8a, 8b and 8ab expressed in transiently transfected Vero E6 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, mouse anti-8a polyclonal antibody specifically detected 8a and 8ab whereas mouse anti-8b polyclonal antibody detected 8b and 8ab. 8a and 8b migrated close to their predicted molecular weight of 4.5 kDa and 9.6 kDa, respectively, whereas two forms of 8ab, \u223c 14 kDa (major) and \u223c 12 kDa (minor), were detected (Fig. 1C). As the predicted molecular weight of 8ab is 13.8 kDa, the minor form is likely to have arisen from cleavage of the full-length protein.",

All these proteins were not tagged except for M, where the C terminus was fused with a HA tag because of the lack of a suitable antibody for the detection of M. 8a, 8b and 8ab were fused at their C termini with a myc tag so that it is possible to compare the relative expression of the three proteins in this experiment. N-terminal-tagged myc-GST was used as a negative control. The results showed that 8a-myc interacted strongly with S, 8b-myc interacted strongly with M, E, 3a and 7a and 8ab-myc interacted strongly with S, 3a and 7a (Table 1\nand Fig. 3\n).

Thus, genetic and epidemiological studies can yield valuable insights on how viruses cross the species barrier and evolve to cause disease in humans (Webby et al., 2004). Indeed, such studies conducted on the SARS-CoV have revealed that this virus has crossed the animal\u2013human barrier recently (Donnelly et al., 2004, Guan et al., 2003, Lau et al., 2005, Song et al., 2005). Interestingly, the animal strains of SARS-CoV, isolated from a raccoon dog and palm civets in markets/restaurants and from wild bats, contain an extra 29-nt in the ORF8 region (Guan et al., 2003, Lau et al., 2005, Song et al., 2005). This 29-nt sequence is not found in all the human strains that were isolated in the middle phase of the epidemic but is present in most of the human isolates from the earliest outbreaks in Guangdong, China, 2002 (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). Indeed, human infection in the early phase probably represents the first breach of the animal\u2013human barrier as these isolates share the closest phylogenetic relationship with the animal isolates.",

Although it is clear that the S gene was undergoing positive selection (Holmes, 2005), whether the genetic variation in the ORF8 region is a result of viral adaptation or genomic instability remains to be determined. As a consequence of the additional 29-nt in the ORF8 region, the 8a and 8b protein in the human SARS-CoV, circulating during the middle phase of the epidemic, are joined together to form a single protein, 8ab, in the animal SARS-CoV or human SARS-CoV from the early and late phases (Fig. 1B).",

Using reverse genetic methods, Yount and co-workers (2005) also reported similar findings in the mouse model. These results suggested that the 8a, 8b and 8ab proteins are not essential for viral replication or pathogenesis in the mouse and palm civet models. However, we found that the expression of 8b can down-regulate the expression of E in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) and the expressions of 8b and E in SARS-CoV-infected cells were mutually exclusive (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the expression of E was not affected by either 8a or 8ab (Fig. 4A). In addition, Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA level of E was not decreased in the presence of the 8b protein, suggesting that the effect of 8b on the expression of the E protein is likely to be post-translational (Fig. 5).",

DeDiego and Luis Enjuanes, Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, Madrid, Spain). However, the role of the E protein in SARS-CoV replication in its natural host remains unclear. Interestingly, the E protein is essential for the replication of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Ortego et al., 2002) but not for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Kuo and Masters, 2003). However, for the latter, the deletion of the E gene reduces virus replication significantly. In addition, it was reported that overexpression of SARS-CoV E can induce apoptosis in T cells (Yang et al., 2005); thus, the down-regulation of E may also have an effect on viral pathogenesis.",

            "text": "An interesting question that arises from our observations concerns the regulation of 8b expression during SARS-CoV infection. 8a and 8b are encoded by the bicistronic subgenomic RNA 8 produced in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Marra et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003). Because its translation initiation codon is not the first AUG in the subgenomic RNA, the 8b protein is likely to be expressed via an internal ribosomal entry mechanism or by a leaky ribosomal scanning mode of translation, as have been described for viral proteins encoded by other bicistronic or tricistronic coronaviral mRNAs (Liu and Inglis, 1992, Senanayake and Brian, 1997, Thiel and Siddell, 1994). However, in order for 8b to be expressed via such mechanisms, activation of certain host translational machineries may be necessary (Komar and Hatzoglou, 2005, Stoneley and Willis, 2004). Indeed, we observed that 8b was only expressed in a fraction of the SARS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 7). This means that the effect of 8b on viral replication or pathogenesis is likely to be only modulative as viral replication in those cells that did not express high levels of 8b will be normal. However, this modulating mechanism is not functional in the animal SARS-CoV because 8ab does not appear to have any effect on the expression of E. In future studies, it will be crucial to determine the underlying mechanism regulating the expression of 8b and its temporal expression during the viral replication cycle.",
