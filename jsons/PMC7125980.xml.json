            "text": "In Taiwan, there are three major tax-filing methods: manual filing, two-dimension (2D) bar code filing, and Internet filing. Since 1998, the Taiwan government has moved aggressively to promote Internet tax filings under the e-government initiative, the goals of which are a paperless environment, an efficient process, and the public's convenience in contacting government agencies.1 The tax authority in Taiwan, the National Tax Administration (NTA), promoted the system by providing incentives, such as faster tax refunds and online credit card payment, which results in an increasing number of Internet tax filers (see Table 1\n). With regard to the aforementioned three methods, public satisfaction is greatest with the 2D bar code filing, and the manual filing method is the least satisfactory.2 Despite all the efforts of NTA's promotion and the low satisfaction, traditional manual filing remains the most widespread method. Though 2D bar code is classified as an electronic tax-filing method, it still requires taxpayers to print their return in paper form and mail it to the government agent. Therefore, this study focuses on the Internet tax-filing method, the only method that would eventually achieve one of the e-government's goals to be paperless, and examines the critical factors that influence the acceptance of the Internet tax-filing system.",

Several past studies have examined the relationship of perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), attitudes, intention, and the usage of information technologies. Lee et al.3 summarized the information systems examined by TAM in 101 articles published by leading IS journals and conferences from 1986 to 2003 into four different classes: communication system (20%), general purpose system (28%), office system (27%), and specialized business system (25%). Among this research, little was done in the e-government area. However, applying TAM to the e-government system can lead to a better understanding not only of public acceptance of the Internet tax-filing system but also of the possible differences between the e-government and other types of Internet applications.",

Additionally, perceived credibility (PC) was indicated as an influential factor affecting the electronic tax-filing system.14 Altogether, the authors proposed a TAM-like research framework with the ISQ, IQ, and PC of the Internet tax-filing system that affect the taxpayers' PU and PEOU, and additionally the attitude and the intention to utilize the system.",

Since 1992, nearly 300 articles in leading journals have referred to or adopted the D&M IS success model.6 Among these success variables, the conceptualization of the \u201cuse\u201d construct was especially confusing in the original D&M model. The IS use was defined as the consumption of IS output which is consistent with a process model of IS success. Seddon13 identifies three distinct models intermingled in the D&M model, each reflecting a different interpretation of IS use. From a process model of IS success, \u201cuse\u201d depicts the sequence of events relating to an IS. A second meaning is a variable that proxies for the benefits from \u201cuse.\u201d A third meaning is the dependent variable in a variance model of future IS use in which the role of IS use is used to describe behavior. To avoid the confusion associated with D&M, this study used D&M-like6 quality antecedents to summarize the external variables of the TAM acceptance model for the Internet tax-filing system.",

The value of composite reliabilities higher than the threshold level of 0.7 was deemed to provide satisfactory reliability. In this research, the composite reliability for each construct in the measurement model was above 0.90 (see Table 4\n). Further, another measure of reliability is the average variance extracted. This measure reflects the overall amount of variance in the indicators accounted for by the latent construct. Higher variance extracted value occurs when the indicators are truly representative of the latent construct. The average variance extracted measure is a complementary measure to the construct reliability value. Guidelines suggest that the average extracted variance value should exceed a 0.50 level for a construct, which means more than one-half of the variances observed. In Table 4, average variances extracted for all constructs were above 0.70. As a result, it is concluded that all the constructs used in this study were highly reliable.",

Convergent validity is assessed by testing whether the factor loading that relate each indicator to the construct of interest are all significant,52., 53. i.e., t values greater than 1.96 (P\n < 0.05). In this study, all t values are between 3.13 and 33.20, which indicates good convergent validity. Discriminant validity is the degree to which measures of different concepts are distinct. To test discriminant validity, Fornell and Larcker54 suggested that the squared correlations between two different measures in any two constructs should be statistically lower than the variance shared by the measures of a construct. All shared variances between any two different constructs were, in fact, less than the amount of variance extracted by one of the two constructs (see Table 5\n). Therefore, the constructs of the proposed research model exhibit adequate discriminant validity. Table 6\ncontains the LISREL-calculated correlations among the constructs.",

The possible explanations include the following: First, the effect of PEOU on IT usage often decreases with user familiarity with the IT.59 Only experienced Internet tax-filing taxpayers were selected in this study, and most of them were already familiar with the operation of the Internet tax-filing method. Therefore, the effect of PEOU on Internet filing acceptance is not as important as PU. Second, the respondents' education level in this study was, on average, higher than that in Wang's study. In general, higher education assures more computer and Internet experience. Therefore, PEOU may not be an important concern for these respondents.",

A slow response system is considered to be useless and not worth the wait compared with a difficult-to-use system. Lastly, the empirical result shows that PC has created a certain impact on PU.

The authors also tested the revised LISREL model with this linkage. However, GFI of the revised model decreased dramatically from 0.85 to 0.73, which indicated that the presence of the relationship between PEOU and PC in the proposed model could not significantly explain the obtained data results. The inadequate results may be caused by the difference in the sampling characteristic or the different information system applied. Future research could also be extended to examine the linkage between PEOU and PC in the e-government service context.",

Since the current experienced users weigh PU heavily, the NTA should propose some promotional plans that capitalize on the benefits of using the Internet tax-filing system in order to retain/keep the current users. The PU has a three times stronger impact than PEOU (PU: 0.74, PEOU: 0.21) on attitude toward the system, which then influences the intention to use the system next year and afterwards. To increase the PU of using the Internet tax-filing system, the tax agency needs to provide a better ISQ, IQ, and PC. For example, faster response time of the Internet tax-filing system will lead users to perceive higher usefulness of the system. Under budget constraints, the priority of the improvement should start from ISQ, then IQ, and finally PC, respectively, since each has an impact on PU as ISQ: 0.37; IQ: 0.28; and PC: 0.10. Besides, the empirical results also show that the quality factors (e.g., IQ, ISQ,) of the Internet tax-filing system have positive impacts on taxpayers' PEOU of using the system. To create new users, the NTA needs to provide more training courses and simplify the interface design to make the system easier to use.",

The e-government projects are outsourced to professional computer system's vendors. Without ongoing quality monitoring, e-government service may deviate, or depart somewhat, from citizens' requirements and expectations. The authors suggest that explicit statements of quality concern should be added in the future maintenance contract with e-government system providers. Moreover, the NTA should be responsible for the following jobs: (1) to define standards and prepare reliable quality measurements of ISQ, IQ, and PC. The instrument of this study may provide a good reference, (2) to apply different evaluation methods of the Internet tax-filing system to detect ongoing quality, and (3) to define a corrective action plan when quality levels deviate from the standards.",

To fulfill the concept of citizen as customer, there is still room for improvement. In Taiwan, there are about 3.8 million households using the Internet, and the registered online users number about 8.7 million. These are the major potential Internet tax-filing users.65 In addition, the number of 2003 Internet tax-filers doubled over that of 2002 (see Table 1). A major reason was the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Taiwan during the 2003 tax-filing season. Therefore, applying TAM to the Internet tax-filing system can lead to an understanding of public acceptance of the system and can shed some light on research of the G2C e-government system in the future.",
