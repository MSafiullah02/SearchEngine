Matsuzaki, et al., Wait-time for hysterectomy and survival of women with early-stage cervical cancer: A clinical implication during the coronavirus pandemic, Gynecologic Oncology (2020), https://doi.Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 ABSTRACT Objective: A global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (Covid-19) has created unique challenges to providing timely care for cancer patients. In early-stage cervical cancer, postponing hysterectomy for 6-8 weeks is suggested as a possible option in the Covid-19 burdened hospitals. Yet, literature examining the impact of surgery wait-time on survival in early-stage cervical cancer remains scarce. This study examined the association between surgery wait-time of 8 weeks and oncologic outcome in women with early-stage cervical cancer. Methods: This is a single institution retrospective observational study at a tertiary referral medical center examining women who underwent primary hysterectomy or trachelectomy for clinical stage IA-IIA invasive cervical cancer between 2000 and 2017 (N=217). Wait-time from the diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer via biopsy to definitive surgery was categorized as: short wait-time (<8 weeks; n=110) versus long wait-time (\u22658 weeks; n=107). Propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the measured demographics between the two groups, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was performed. Results: In a weighted model (median follow-up, 4.6 years), women in the long waittime group had DFS (4.5-year rates, 91.2% versus 90.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-2.59, P=0.818) and OS (95.0% versus 97.4%, HR 1.47, 95%CI 0.50-4.31, P=0.487) similar to those in the short wait-time group. Three studies were examined for meta-analysis (median, n=217), and a pooled HR for surgery waittime of \u22658 weeks on DFS was 0.96 (95%CI 0.59-1.55). Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 Conclusion: Our study suggests that wait-time of 8 weeks for hysterectomy may not be associated with short-term disease recurrence in women with early-stage cervical cancer.

In the United States, it is estimated that there will be 13,800 new cases and 4,290 deaths from cervical cancer in 2020 [2] . Treatment of women with cervical cancer is largely dependent on the stage of cancer [3] . Hysterectomy-based approach is the surgical treatment of choice for women with early-stage cervical cancer [3] . In the United States, the vast majority of women with early-stage cervical cancer receive hysterectomy (Supplemental Figure S1 ). For instance, 82.7% of women with stage T1b(\u22644cm) disease underwent hysterectomy-based surgical treatment from 2010-2016 in the United States.",

This is based on the observation that disease progression is rare among women with pregnancy complicated by early-stage cervical cancer, and those affected patients often undergo expectant delay in delivery for the purpose of fetal maturation during pregnancy without compromising survival outcome [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .",

Of note, this median wait-time for hysterectomy is similar to the 6-8 week time-frame suggested by the expert panel for postponing surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic [10] . It is therefore speculated that surgery waittime of 6-8 weeks may not be considered a \"prolonged\" wait-time period for early cervical cancer.",

Additional sensitivity analysis and systematic literature review with meta-analysis enhanced the robustness of study findings. A limitation of the study includes that this is a retrospective study that may have an unmeasured bias. For example, the exact reason for delay from diagnosis to surgery is not retrievable from the archived records. Performance status, medical condition, and socio-economic reasons may have affected the wait-time as well as the survival outcome, and missing these factors limit the interpretation of the study. It is also possible that longer follow-up would elucidate differences in OS, as a prior study found differences in outcomes only after 5 years of follow-up [16] . Most importantly, the sample size of our study is somehow limited raising the potential for type II error as Forest plots for (A) DFS (B) OS are shown. In an exploratory analysis, two time-varying HRs from one study [16] were analyzed as discrete values. A forest plot from a random effect analysis of two studies including our study stratified by inclusion criteria of systematic review. ",
