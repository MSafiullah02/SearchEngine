Several super-spreading individuals have been identified for the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We develop a model for superspreading events of infectious diseases, which is based on the outbreak of SARS. Using this model we describe two methods for estimating the parameters of the model, which we demonstrate with the small-scale SARS outbreak at the Amoy Gardens, Hong Kong, and the large-scale outbreak in the entire Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. One method is based on parameters calculated for the classical susceptible -infected -removed (SIR) disease model. The second is based on parameter estimates found in the literature. Using the parameters calculated for the SIR model, our model predicts an outcome similar to that for the SIR model. On the other hand, using parameter estimates from SARS literature our model predicts a much more serious epidemic.",

It is a serious form of pneumonia, resulting in acute respiratory distress and sometimes death. SARS emerged in China late 2002 and quickly spread to 32 countries causing more than 774 deaths and 8098 infections worldwide. One of the intriguing characteristics of the SARS epidemic was the occurrence of superspreading events. Super-spreading events for a specific infectious disease occur when certain infected individuals, called super-spreaders, infect more than the average number of secondary cases.",

Such super-spreading individuals have been identified in the SARS outbreak and they are thought to have caused most of the secondary infections. For example, in Singapore, about 80% of infections have been attributed to only 5 superspreading individuals ( [7] ). One extreme super-spreading individual in Hong Kong caused more than 100 secondary infections ( [13] ). To contrast, in Singapore, most individuals caused 0 secondary infections ( [10] ). One differential equation model for super-spreading individuals was proposed before the recent SARS outbreak, by Kemper ([6] ). He presents a modified susceptibleinfected -removed (SIR) disease model to capture the effect of the super-spreading individuals in which the infected individuals are split into two different infected classes with different transmission rates. The superspreaders have a higher transmission rate, meaning more of their contacts with susceptible individuals result in a new infection than the regular infected individuals. This was the first model designed specifically to address the effect of super-spreading individuals on the course of infectious disease epidemics.",

It is interesting to note how each incorporated the super-spreading events into their model. First are models where the super-spreading individuals have a higher transmission rate than the regular infected individuals, as in Kemper ([6] ). For example, Masuda, et al. ([10] ) developed a contact network model which had different transmission rates for regular infected individuals and for super-spreading individuals. Second are models in which parameters are taken from probability distributions, making the super-spreading individuals naturally appear as the right-hand tail of the distributions. Lloyd-Smith, et al. ( [9] ) developed a stochastic compartment model and Fang, et al. ([4] ) developed a spacial lattice combined with a deterministic compartment model wherein the individual reproduction numbers are drawn from a continuous probability distribution.",

The modification is inspired by Li, et al.

These individuals remaining outside of isolation longer than normal are related to the disease severity. They have more contacts with susceptible individuals and thus more chances to spread the disease, in other words, they are the superspreaders. In our model, we split the infected individuals into two classes, with two different \"removal\" rates; these two rates determine how long an infected individual remains outside of isolation.",

This leads us to set a lower bound on the probability of becoming a regular infected individual of 0.8, and we have 0.8 < b < 1. For SARS, after onset of symptoms regular infected individuals stayed out of isolation between 3 and 5 days ( [3] ); we assume the average and set \u03bd 1 = 1/4. We assume that on average super-spreading individuals moved into isolation 10 days after they became infectious, that is, \u03bd 2 = 1/10. Finally, many researcher have shown that the individual reproduction number, R 0 , for the SARS outbreak is between 1.5 and 4 ([1]).
