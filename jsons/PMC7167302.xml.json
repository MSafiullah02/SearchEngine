            "text": "The open-label non-randomized clinical trial of Gautret and co-workers [2] suggested hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for COVID-19 therapy. In this trial, twenty-six cases were treated daily with 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine (six patients were lost during the monitoring) and presented a significant decrease in viral load after six days compared to untreated controls. Among hydroxychloroquine-treated patients, six also received azithromycin (500 mg on the first day followed by 250 mg daily) in order to prevent bacterial infection. The most interesting finding of this study was that all patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples, i.e., 100% of patients treated with both drugs were virologically cured compared to 57.1% of subjects treated with hydroxychloroquine only, and 12.5% of untreated individuals. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have direct antiviral activity, as demonstrated in vitro [3]. Nine studies have used such drugs for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, including one phase 4 clinical trial (ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT04316377). Moreover, different action mechanisms of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the COVID-19 have been proposed based on the known action of SARS-CoV-2 and its supposed similarity with the SARS-CoV replication cycle (reviewed by [4]). However, to the best of our knowledge, except the clinical trial of Gautret and co-workers [2], there are no other studies and clinical trials investigating the effects of azithromycin in COVID-19. A possible reason for this fact may be that azithromycin is a classical antibiotic with very little effects reported against virus [5\u20137] and so far unknown effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Stem cells might also be a target for viral infection and interesting therapy for combating COVID-19 lung disease. In a previous seminal work, Ling et al. [28] studied the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV in mouse neonatal Oct-4 positive, SSEA-1, Sca-1, cytokeratin-7 and ACE2 expressing lung cell epithelial colonies surrounded by a stroma of neonatal lung tissue. These residing lung stem cells expressed ACE2, one of the entry receptors of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2). The authors observed Oct-4+, long-term BrdU label-retaining cells in the broncho-alveolar junction of the neonatal lung, being in line with the in vitro results. Cultures of Oct-4 lung stem cells could be infected with SARS-CoV with subsequent virus replication, suggesting that failing lung repair of SARS-CoV-infected involves the loss of mobilization and differentiation of lung stem and progenitor cells. On the other hand, CD147, the second entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, has been proposed to be a marker protein of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells, and the monoclonal antibody against this protein also stained lung cancer cells [29]. It is possible that CD147 is also expressed by untransformed lung stem and progenitor cells; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental evidence for such affirmation. CD147 is expressed by mesenchymal stem cells of human cord blood and bone-marrow origin, suggesting that the CD147 protein is expressed by tissue-specific stem cells [30]. Thus, besides the loss of airway epithelial cells by viral infection and replication, a second component responsible for missing cellular regeneration is proposed, since stem and regenerating cells can be directly infected and lost.",

These cell deposit extracellular matrix proteins and are the main cells presents in fibrotic diseases [31], including pulmonary fibrosis and fibrous stripes due to COVID-19. In fact, current clinical evidences suggest that pulmonary fibrosis or fibrous stripes are important complications due to COVID-19 [32]. Pan and co-workers [33] observed that 17% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients presented fibrous stripes. Myofibroblasts seem to be originated from several types of cells, such as resident fibroblasts [34], pericytes [35, 36], type II pneumocytes via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [37], and resident stem cells/MSC-like cells [38, 39]. Recent evidence using lineage tracing showed that resident mesenchymal cells are the main sources of myofibroblasts in pulmonary fibrosis, rather than epithelial or bone marrow-derived cells [40]. It was observed that resident stem cells/MSC-like cells (side population (SP) and GLI1+ cells) [39, 41] play an important role in pulmonary fibrosis, and their numbers decline in mice and patients with this complication compared to healthy controls [38, 39, 41].",

On the other hand, ACE2 activity cleaving Ang-II inhibits experimental lung fibrosis, and patients with this clinical complication presented downregulated levels of this receptor [42]. CD147, the second entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is also present in multiple cellular types in lung and highly expressed in type II pneumocytes and macrophages at the edges of the fibrotic zones [44]. Normal human lung fibroblasts were transiently transfected to overexpress CD147 and presented a significant increase in TGF-\u03b21-induced proliferation and expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, a marker of myofibroblasts. On the other hand, anti-CD147 antibodies inhibited TGF-\u03b21-induced proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts [44].

Can azithromycin have any invasion inhibitory activity (as already reported elsewhere [11\u201313]) for the case of COVID-19? Does azithromycin treatment decrease the expression of MMPs and possibly CD147, reducing SARS-CoV-2 invasion? Both Plasmodium falciparum causing Malaria and SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 are susceptive to hydroxychloroquine treatment; however, are both pathogens also susceptible to azithromycin because they need of the CD147 protein for cell invasion? Can resident progenitor/stem cells be targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or affected in their differentiation capabilities? Can effects of immunomodulatory and anti-viral response of MCSs and azithromycin, respectively, be therapeutically exploited CODIV-19 treatment? Can patients with asthma or diabetes mellitus have high expression levels of CD147 receptor, and are they for this reason more prone to complications?",

Azithromycin has been worldwide used for the treatment of infectious diseases with few side effects and can be rapidly produced in large scale, unlike monoclonal antibodies that generally have a slower production process. Nethertheless, further studies need to be carried out to confirm the possible role and mechanism of the azithromycin in COVID-19. Moreover, progenitor/stem cells can be extensively recruited in pulmonary fibrosis of COVID-19 patients and possibly suffer direct invasion via CD147 or ACE. Thus, besides the loss of airway epithelial cells, a second component of missing cellular regeneration is proposed. Certainly, more basic and clinical investigations into this issue are necessary for effective therapeutic approaches. Combinations of pharmacological and MSC therapy for successful therapy of COVID-19 and other viral diseases might be available in the future.",

CD147, in addition to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), also acts as receptor of host cells for SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Treatment with anti-CD147 antibodies prevents invasion of host cells by Plasmodium falciparum and SARS-CoV-2 (in vitro and phase 2 clinical trial). Azithromycin also rapidly prevents Plasmodium falciparum invasion, possibly interfering with vital ligand/receptor interactions and also SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the effect of azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been evaluated. Azithromycin induces anti-viral responses in epithelial cells by increasing levels of interferons and interferon-stimulated proteins and decreasing viral replication and virus release. This drug decreases expression of metalloproteinases (MMPs; molecules closely related to CD147). Both, influenza A virus in cells of Asthma patients as well as high glucose concentration in vitro increase CD147 expression, suggesting possible correlations within asthma, diabetes mellitus and CD147 levels in clinical complications due to SARS-CoV-2 infection",

Pulmonary fibrosis is heavily populated by myofibroblasts. These cells seem to be originated from several types of cells, mainly resident stem cells/MSC-like cells. Early-phase COVID-19 pneumonia can show type II pneumocytes hyperplasia and fibroblast proliferation/fibroblast focias initial step of pulmonary fibrosis, while later COVID-19 phases can present fibrosis and fibrous stripes. Anti-CD147 antibodies inhibit TGF- \u03b21-induced proliferation and differentiation of normal human lung fibroblasts in vitro. In addition to extensive differentiation, possible direct viral invasion of progenitor/stem cells via CD147 or ACE2 could result in the decline of these cellular stocks and failing lung repair. Benefits of cellular therapy with allogeneic MSC transplantation from healthy donators are being investigated. These cells can induce immunosuppression and tissue regeneration",
