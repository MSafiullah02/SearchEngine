The spectrum of disease has changed with the introduction of HAART with a fall in the overall incidence of opportunistic infections and an increase in medicine related side\u2010effects and of conditions found in the HIV\u2010seronegative population. If a cause is not apparent consultation with a gastroenterologist with an interest in HIV related disease of the GI tract is indicated since HIV\u2010seropositive individuals are also susceptible to many of the same conditions as the HIV\u2010seronegative population.

In general, when individuals present with acute bacterial diarrhoea and a CD4 count <200 cells/\u03bcL, therapy will be indicated (category IV recommendation). When indicated, the choice should be guided by in vitro sensitivity patterns and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be requested if not routine. Whilst the majority of isolates will be sensitive to ciprofloxacin 500 mg bd po for 5 days there are increasing reports of resistance, in both Campylobacter spp and Salmonella spp. In addition, the relationships between fluoroquinolones and C. difficile infection and MRSA colonization are resulting in less empirical use of this agent.

Cryptosporidium, a protozoan parasite, was the most common pathogen in HIV\u2010antibody\u2010positive individuals with chronic diarrhoea in the pre\u2010HAART era. Those at greatest risk of infection are individuals with a CD4 count <100 cells/\u03bcL [66]. It predominantly infects the small bowel mucosa, but in the immunocompromised patient, the large bowel and extraintestinal sites may be involved. The most common species infecting humans in the UK are C. hominis and the zoonotic species C. parvum and C. meleagridis [67]. In areas with a low rate of environmental contamination and where HAART is widely available, cryptosporidiosis has an incidence of<1 per 100 person\u2010years among HIV\u2010seropositive individuals. Ingestion of cryptosporidium oocysts leads to transmission of the parasite. Faeces from infected animals, including humans, can contaminate the water supply with viable oocysts, which are highly resistant to chlorination. Transmission may also occur during sex, particularly via the faecal\u2013oral route [68].",

Antigen detection or PCR of stool may also be performed and endoscopy with biopsy can aid diagnosis if stool analysis fails to confirm the diagnosis or diagnostic uncertainty remains. Serology can be employed but remains positive for years after exposure and therefore direct identification of entamoeba is desirable. Extra\u2010intestinal lesions are diagnosed in the appropriate clinical setting by imaging combined with serology.

Despite anecdotal reports, there is no conclusive evidence that infection or hyperinfection is more common in patients with HIV, although it may be implicated in immune reconstitution syndromes [112]. Corticosteroid use remains a major factor in case reports of hyperinfection syndrome of HIV\u2010seropositive individuals [113]. Eosinophilia is present in most but not all patients. Uncomplicated infection is treated with ivermectin 200 \u03bcg/kg once a day po for 1 or 2 days, which is more effective than the alternative treatment of albendazole 400 mg bd po for 3 days [114, 115, 116] (category III recommendation).
