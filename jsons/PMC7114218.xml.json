Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with nonsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA (Enjuanes et al., 2000, Enjuanes et al., 2008). The spike (S) glycoprotein projects approximately 17\u201320 nm from the virion surface. Other structural proteins are the integral membrane (M) glycoprotein, a minor envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Functionally, the S glycoprotein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies (Garwes et al., 1978, Jim\u00e9nez et al., 1986, Laude et al., 1987, Ant\u00f3n et al., 1996, Sune et al., 1990), and it is also related to cell tropism (Jacobs et al., 1986, Torres et al., 1996, S\u00e1nchez et al., 1999, Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2003), interaction with its cellular receptor (Collins et al., 1982, Delmas et al., 1990, Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2002, Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2003, Liu et al., 2009, Shulla and Gallagher, 2009), pathogenicity (Krempl et al., 1997, Garwes et al., 1978, Tuboly et al., 1994), fusion (Collins et al., 1982, Spaan et al., 1988, Sune et al., 1990) and hemagglutination activity (Krempl and Herrler, 2001, Krempl et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) are plasma membrane microdomains characterized by insolubility in cold nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 or Brij-98 and by enrichment of cholesterol and sphingomyelin (Glebov and Nichols, 2004). Accumulating evidence suggests the involvement of DRMs in virus life cycles (Simons and Ehehalt, 2002). Cholesterol, a major constituent of DRMs is important in the entry of nonenveloped viruses such as simian virus 40 (SV40), rotavirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus (Suzuki and Suzuki, 2006). The binding of enveloped viruses to specific cellular receptors and fusion of the viral membrane with a cellular membrane are indispensable for virus entry. Correspondingly, the initiation of virus infection may require cholesterol in either of the two membranes involved or in both. Previous data show that the infectivity of influenza virus and canine distemper virus is sensitive to cholesterol depletion from the viral membrane (Imhoff et al., 2007, Sun and Whittaker, 2003). In contrast, murine leukemia virus, Ebola virus, and Marburg virus are sensitive to cholesterol depletion from the cellular membrane (Bavari et al., 2002, Lu et al., 2002). Cholesterol in both membranes is required for the infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (Smith and Helenius, 2004, Nayak and Hui, 2004), while vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication is unaffected by cholesterol depletion.",

As cholesterol depletion from TGE virions results in a reduction of viral infectivity (Ren et al., 2008), we were interested to find out whether the surface protein S that mediates virus entry is localized in DRMs. For this purpose, we analyzed whether the TGEV S protein is resistant to solubilization by Triton X-100 at 4 \u00b0C. As shown in Fig. 1A, the S protein was found in the pellet, i.e. it was associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. For comparison, we used vesicular stomatitis virus that is not affected in its infectivity when cholesterol is depleted from the viral membrane. The surface protein G of this virus was only detected in the soluble fraction. The same result was obtained when two other non-ionic detergents were used, Tween 20 or Brij96 (data not shown). This solubilization behavior would be compatible with the presence of the S protein in detergent-resistant microdomains. To further characterize the membrane association of the S protein, TGEV particles were treated with M\u03b2CD to deplete cholesterol from the viral membrane. M\u03b2CD is commonly used to destroy the integrity of DRMs. Application of this drug at a concentration of 10 mM reduced approximately 33% infectivity of TGEV (P\n < 0.01), compared with the infectivity of non-treated viruses (Fig. 1B). To analyze the association of cholesterol with the infectivity of TGEV, a cholesterol replenishment assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 1C, the infectivity of TGEV restored to 80% of the value determined prior to cholesterol depletion, after addition of 200 \u03bcM exogenous cholesterol to M\u03b2CD-treated TGEV (Fig. 1C). The data indicate that the viral infectivity is significantly reduced by M\u03b2CD and can be restored by cholesterol. However, the S protein was still only detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that the surface protein of TGEV is arranged in the viral envelope in a detergent-resistant way that is not affected by cholesterol depletion.",

To exclude binding to cellular sialoglycoconjugates, ST cells were enzymatically desialylated to allow only virus binding to pAPN (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2002). The neuraminidase-treated cells were incubated with cholesterol-depleted virus or with control virus, respectively, for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Unbound virions were removed by thorough washing and bound virus was measured by an indirect ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4B, M\u03b2CD treatment lowered TGEV infectivity significantly, but had no effect on the binding to desialylated cells. From this result we conclude that cholesterol depletion from the viral membrane does not affect the binding of TGEV to pAPN (Fig. 4A). To characterize a potential postadsorption step affected in the infection by the cholesterol-depleted TGEV we performed an infection assay where the inoculum was applied for 1 h at either 4 or 37 \u00b0C, respectively. The former conditions should allow binding but not concurrent rearrangement of cellular or viral proteins. Following the adsorption period, cells were overlaid by methylcellulose and at 48 h.p.i., the number of plaques was determined. As shown in Fig. 5\n, when the virus was applied at 37 \u00b0C, the infectivity titer of cholesterol-depleted TGEV was significantly lower compared to the control virus. On the other hand, when adsorption occurred at 4 \u00b0C, the titer of M\u03b2CD-treated virus was not reduced, it was even slightly increased when compared to the untreated virus. This result indicates that the effect of cholesterol depletion from the viral membrane on the infectivity of TGEV is evident only when infection is initiated at 37 \u00b0C but not when adsorption occurs at 4 \u00b0C.",

            "text": "Lipid rafts have been reported to play important roles in different stages of the virus life cycle such as viral entry, protein transport and targeting, as well as assembly and budding (Nayak and Hui, 2004). Cholesterol, a characteristic structural component of lipid rafts, is thought to function as a dynamic glue that keeps the raft assembly together (Simons and Toomre, 2000). As far as virus entry is concerned most of the information available is related to the role of DRMs in the plasma membrane of the target cell where they may act as platforms for concentration of virus receptors and/or for an efficient penetration process. However, the exact mechanism how membrane microdomains contribute to virus entry is not known. This is also true for coronaviruses which are reduced in their infectivity when the integrity of DRMs is abolished by cholesterol depletion of the target cell membrane (Bavari et al., 2002, Li et al., 2007, Ren et al., 2008, Thorp and Gallagher, 2004). Despite this similarity, coronaviruses differ with respect to the location of the cellular receptor. Aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor of human coronavirus 229E, TGEV and some other members of this virus family is constitutively present in DRMs. By contrast, the receptor for mouse hepatitis virus, CEACAM, is usually detected in the detergent-soluble fraction but may be recruited to the DRM fraction during the entry process (Choi et al., 2005, Thorp and Gallagher, 2004).",

As these viruses belong to quite diverse families, the importance of cholesterol in the viral membrane may be a more general feature of many enveloped viruses. The importance of cholesterol in the viral membrane may suggest that DRMs are present in the viral envelope and may be important for the function of the viral membrane proteins. The evidence, however, is circumstantial as DRM association of viral proteins has been analyzed only in infected cells. It has not been demonstrated that the association of viral protein with membrane microdomains is maintained in the viral envelope. It gets even more complicated with viruses like herpesviruses, coronaviruses or hepatitis virus B which mature at intracellular membranes. The concentration of cholesterol and sphingolipids is increasing in the membranes along the secretory pathway, i.e. from the ER to the plasma membrane. Despite budding from intracellular organelles, surface glycoproteins may reach the cell surface which makes it difficult to distinguish the subsets of membrane glycoproteins that enter virus particles.",

DRMs are typically recovered as low-density material in equilibrium flotation gradients and measuring DRM association provides valuable information regarding the preference for rafts by proteins or lipids of interest (Ono et al., 2005). Sedimentation analysis indicated that the TGEV S protein cannot be solubilized by cold non-ionic detergents. Though this behavior is compatible with the location of a protein in DRMs, other pieces of evidence do not support this conclusion. Cholesterol depletion did not render the S protein soluble by cold non-ionic detergent and in the flotation analysis it was not transferred to fractions where DRM proteins are expected. Therefore, factors other than cholesterol-rich detergent membranes are responsible for the insolubility in cold non-ionic detergents. Interaction with other viral proteins such as the M and/or the E protein may contribute to this behavior. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the VSV G protein behaves different from the TGEV S protein. The former protein may interact with other proteins in the viral envelope not as tightly making it easier to solubilize G by detergent treatment.",

            "text": "Though the effect of cholesterol depletion on virus infectivity cannot be explained by the lipid raft concept, it is evident that cholesterol is important for virus entry. Our analysis did not provide any evidence that the two binding activities of the S protein, binding to sialic acids on sialoglycoconjugates and binding to aminopeptidase N, are reduced in cholesterol-depleted virions. Therefore, a post-adsorption step appears to require cholesterol for optimal infectivity. Stages in the infection cycle following the binding to cellular receptors have also been implicated in the importance of cholesterol for other viruses (Funk et al., 2008, Hambleton et al., 2007). To understand the role of cholesterol, one should keep in mind that cholesterol depletion results in a reduction but not in the abolishment of virus infectivity. Virus entry may occur also at lower cholesterol levels but increased cholesterol makes this process more efficient. In this context it is interesting that cholesterol depletion reduced infectivity only when virus binding occurred at elevated temperatures. When the adsorption step was performed at 4 \u00b0C, the infectivity was somewhat lower but unaffected by cholesterol depletion. Interestingly Choi and coworkers reported a similar finding when they analyzed the infection by mouse hepatitis virus with cholesterol-depleted cells (Choi et al., 2005). Based on these findings we conclude that virus entry can be optimized when binding of virions to the cell surface can be combined with membrane rearrangements that are possible at 37 \u00b0C but not at 4 \u00b0C. Future work has to address the question whether cholesterol facilitates coronavirus entry by affecting the membrane fluidity or whether other molecular interactions depend on an increased content of cholesterol.",
