Infections with Chlamydia\npsittaci have been responsible for small outbreaks of erythema nodosum in adults in the UK, where contact with birds and poultry may be an important clue in source identification. Infection with Yersinia spp. has been reported to cause erythema nodosum in France and Finland but is rare in other countries.

It is characterized by development of indurated areas of erythema, usually on a distal limb, which may be single or multiple. Systemic illness is unusual, although associated fever has been reported and peripheral eosinophilia is common. Early lesions are often pruritic, infiltrated and may blister but then resolve without scarring within a few weeks. Diagnosis is suggested on skin pathology by the demonstration of marked dermal eosinophilia with areas of granulomatous change surrounding aggregates of eosinophilic material, known as \u2018flame figures\u2019. The condition responds to oral corticosteroid therapy.",
