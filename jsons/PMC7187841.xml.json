All these relevant entities and processes together form a data-sharing ecosystem, in which data sharing is initiated by data providers and implemented in databases that play important roles in data management and provide data access for the public.

It is consistent well with the Bermuda Principles, advocating rapid public release of genome sequence data within 24 hours after generation and without restrictions on use proposed by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium in 1996. Given the unexpected emergency circumstances, sharing data in a timely manner is beneficial immediately for worldwide researchers and long-term for the global human society. Certainly, in this particular case, publication rights reserved for data providers is the major concern. In order to make both parties happy, policies for prompt data sharing as common practice and emergency routine are to be established, accepted, and monitored by the society, where detailed considerations and facts, such as criteria for intellectual property reservation, priority for publication, and credit for data providers [6], all must be thoroughly announced and debated in professional and public settings.",

Moreover, data in their full spectrum are definitely preferred, including all useful digital assets that contain, but not limited to, metadata, unprocessed data, derived datasets, analyzed results, source codes, protocols, flowcharts, etc. As a consequence, a collection of standards is certainly needed to be formulated by the user\u2013provider community, and it can be envisaged that the more the community involvement is, the more successful the data-sharing efforts will become.",

After data submission, curation is conducted to certify the shared data with high quality and with the capability of reusability. Therefore, data curation involves a wide range of critical processes with standardized annotation, quality filtering, and value-added representation with controlled vocabularies. Only curated data can be used for further integration with the aim of information mining and synthesis processing. Consequently, translation of big data into knowledge discovery would be achieved, in company with various outreach activities for knowledge dissemination and application. After all, databases provide a core instrument for data management and coordinate the data-sharing ecosystem, orchestrating all important elements relevant to curation, synthesis, and outreach (Figure 1).",

Ideally, funding agencies, journals, governmental organizations, as well as hands-on researchers, must work collaboratively and come up with common-practice protocols for data-sharing activities. Currently, a valuable effort is the Global Microbial Identifier (https://www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org) that aims to build a genomic epidemiological database for global identification of microorganisms in order to detect outbreaks and emerging pathogens. Ongoing efforts for the current outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 primarily include GISAID [14], GenBank [15] in NCBI, and the 2019 novel Coronavirus Resource [16] (2019nCoVR; https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/) in CNCB/NGDC. Among them, 2019nCoVR features comprehensive integration and value-added curation, yielding large-quantity genome sequences with high-quality annotations (Figure 2\n) and providing a suite of services for viral genome data deposition, mining, and translation in real time. However, the need for data exchange and coordination between different databases, linking genomic data with important metadata, and data standardization across countries and laboratories, becomes very urgent and critical. To deal with global outbreaks as the COVID-19 pandemic, large and effective collaborations across different database resources (e.g., 2019nCoVR, GISAID, and GenBank), disciplines, and countries towards data sharing are of immediate necessity.",
