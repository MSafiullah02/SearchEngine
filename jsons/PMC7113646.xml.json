As well as known viral diseases, viral infection is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of many other diseases. However, because the detection and identification of viruses is difficult, establishing etiological roles for viruses in these diseases is challenging. This is particularly true for chronic conditions (e.g., Kawasaki disease) where the virus load is very low or the presence of the virus at the time of sampling is uncertain (Baker et al., 2006, Christen et al., 2012, Simoes et al., 2012). Surprisingly, it may also be true for some acute infections (e.g., respiratory tract infections), where no etiological agent can be identified in a large proportion of cases (Ali et al., 2011, Bezerra et al., 2011, Hayden et al., 2012, Mahony et al., 2011, Regamey et al., 2008, Sanghavi et al., 2012, Thomazelli et al., 2007). Although the failure to identify an infecting virus may be due to the presence of a novel pathogen, we have shown previously that it can also be due to the imperfect diagnostic system (Pyrc et al., 2012).",

The genomic nucleic acids (27\u201332 kb) are shielded by the nucleocapsid protein and interact with membrane, envelope and spike proteins to form a viable, enveloped viral particle (Fields et al., 2007). At present, three major groups of coronaviruses are recognized (alpha-, beta- and gamma-coronaviruses), which are clusters of species sharing a similar genome structure and other general characteristics (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. and King, 2012). Generally, alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are considered to be mammalian pathogens, while gamma-coronaviruses mostly infect birds (Fields et al., 2007). Until 2003, only two human coronaviruses were recognized and the research on this group of pathogens was relatively limited (Bradburne et al., 1967, Kapikian et al., 1969, McIntosh et al., 1967b, McIntosh et al., 1974, Reed, 1984, Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1965). The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the 2002/2003 winter season highlighted the importance of the Coronaviridae family for human health (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). Realization that there was a threat of animal\u2013human transmission of coronaviruses accelerated research into these viruses, and this resulted in the identification of two novel human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, which appeared to have resided in the human population for many years, undetected by diagnostic methods used at the time (van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005).",

            "text": "There are several techniques described for the detection of coronaviruses. The most generic and oldest is electron microscopy, which allows visualization of viral particles in an infectious material (Hamre and Procknow, 1966, McIntosh et al., 1967a). Since the identification of the first coronaviruses with electron microscopy, several other methods have been developed, ranging from cell culture to immune detection and molecular detection (Pyrc et al., 2011, Pyrc et al., 2012, Schildgen et al., 2006). Recently, more sophisticated methods were developed, including sequence-independent techniques that allow amplification of all nucleic acids, regardless of the sequence. Such approaches result in the amplification of targets originating from the host's genetic material, as well as targets of viral origin. Comparison of non-infected control samples with virus-infected samples allowed researchers to select nucleic acid sequence motifs present exclusively in the latter set of samples (Allander et al., 2001, Allander et al., 2005, Anway et al., 2001, Lu et al., 2004, van der Hoek et al., 2004). An interesting (and commonly used) diagnostic approach employs degenerated universal primers able to detect all coronaviruses that share sequence homology at the selected, conserved site; theoretically, this also includes members of the family unrecognized previously (Adachi et al., 2004, Drosten et al., 2003, Escutenaire et al., 2007, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Moes et al., 2005, Stephensen et al., 1999). This approach is promising, although high variability of viral sequences coupled with limitations to the level of degeneration of primers may lead to false-negative results if viral species are not identical to reference strains. To overcome this problem, the CODEHOP technique was developed, allowing the design of highly degenerated DNA primers based on more conserved protein sequences (Rose et al., 1998, Zlateva et al., 2011).",

The method relies on the design of synthetic oligonucleotides that comprise short (6\u20138 nt) elements that recognize conserved regions of viral nucleic acids and longer (16\u201318 nt) anchor elements. These oligonucleotides are then added to termini of RNA fragments during first- and second-strand DNA synthesis. The anchoring regions are subsequently used for amplification and analysis of viral nucleic acids. The use of short (6\u20138 nt) conserved regions to recognize target sequences facilitates the design and development of broad-spectrum assays, and therefore increases the applicability of the method. Although the sensitivity of the method is limited, and thus most suitable for the detection of cultivable pathogens, its potential for recognizing unknown members of the Coronaviridae family means that this is a valuable addition to the range of virus detection and identification tools that already exist.",

The 3\u2032 primers (RT primers) are used for both reverse transcription and for the first PCR amplification. They consist of short (6\u20138 nt) elements homologous to a conserved region present in all targeted genomes and longer (16\u201318 nt) artificial anchor sequences that are used as a template for PCR amplification (Fig. 1\n). Following RT, the RNA\u2013DNA duplex is disrupted with RNase H and a mixture of DNA Polymerase I and SS primers (used for both second-strand synthesis and the first PCR) is added to the sample. The primers for SS synthesis are constructed in the same manner as the RT primers. Therefore, the SS synthesis results in the addition of another anchor (16\u201318 nt) at the 5\u2032 end of the amplified fragment (Fig. 1). The resulting double-stranded DNA, flanked with synthetic oligonucleotides anchored on both termini, is used for the first PCR amplification with RT and SS primers. The product of this amplification is used subsequently for the nested amplification with PCR2 primers that amplify a target within the template DNA. This amplification results in the generation of short amplicons, which can be visualized on a standard agarose gel and sequenced. The general overview of the HexaPrime assay is presented in Fig. 1.",

Arrays corresponding to each sequence are then multiplied logically and the resulting array contains only words present in all tested sequences. This approach appeared to be more effective than simple comparison of sequences and it provides complete information on the presence of a certain nucleotide stretch in the whole genome sequence, which may be of importance during in silico screening of potential primer pairs. The resulting list of words does not contain information on the position of these words in each genome; therefore, these are recovered subsequently from sequence data and the distance between each word pair is determined.

On the other hand, it is only appropriate for identifying viruses that are closely related to known viruses. For the detection of novel viruses that are not detected using universal primers, several sequence-independent techniques have been developed. These include random-priming PCR, representational difference analysis (RDA), and virus discovery based on cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism (VIDISCA) (Adachi et al., 2004, Allander et al., 2001, Allander et al., 2005, Anway et al., 2001, Drosten et al., 2003, Escutenaire et al., 2007, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Lu et al., 2004, Moes et al., 2005, Stephensen et al., 1999, van der Hoek et al., 2004). These methods are named sequence-independent as the amplification is not driven by specific primers, but instead a random (or semi-random) amplification is carried out. For example, a random-priming PCR method utilizes primers containing random nucleotides at their 5\u2032 termini, which are able to attach to and amplify targets, including viral genetic material, indiscriminately (Fouchier et al., 2004). A more specific approach is employed by RDA, where primers selected arbitrarily are used and, following the PCR reaction, infected samples are compared to those of non-infected samples (Liang and Pardee, 1992, Lu et al., 2004). A very different approach is employed in the VIDISCA and SISPA methods. The whole amplification process is based on the presence of common restriction sites in RNA/DNA molecules. Following enzymatic restriction, these restriction sites serve as sites for ligation of synthetic DNA fragments which, in turn, constitute primer attachment sites. In this way, every fragment flanked with certain restriction sites will be amplified. Comparison of the characteristic amplification pattern of infected and control samples may serve to identify nucleic acids of viral origin. Unfortunately, all these approaches are extremely laborious and high-throughput analysis is not possible (Allander et al., 2001, Reyes and Kim, 1991, van der Hoek et al., 2004).",

Although the sensitivity of the assay with the primer sets tested in the current work is indisputably lower than that described for universal primers, it is similar to that described for sequence-independent methods. Because a shorter conserved nucleotide stretch is required for successful priming, the major advantage of the HexaPrime assay is that it provides broader specificity when compared to the standard universal primer approach. It is also worth noting that methods for sequence-independent detection of viral pathogens (e.g., VIDISCA or RDA) require highly-trained personnel and appropriate infrastructure, while the HexaPrime assay is relatively simple. The only additional step, compared to a typical nested PCR, is the ligation of anchors to 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the RNA fragments, which is a single-tube reaction.",

Due to the limited sensitivity of the method, the in vitro culture of pathogens may be a prerequisite for successful amplification. To this end, fully-differentiated airway epithelium cultures may be a useful pre-amplification tool to increase the titers of airway viruses (Pyrc et al., 2012). Obviously, due to technical limitations, this method may be used mostly in research facilities focused on discovery of new pathogens, rather than in clinical virology laboratory settings. The method has been tested for the detection of viruses that belong to a single viral family thus far, although it may also be adopted for other RNA viruses.",
