Methods: Tianjin, a northeastern city in China, was chosen as the region of research and applied the infl uenza-like illness attack rate (ILI)% as the baseline and warning line to determine the severity of infl uenza epidemic. Then, an infl uenza early warning model was constructed based on the theory of rough set and support vector machines (RS-SVM), and the relationship between infl uenza and meteorology was explored through analyzing the monitoring data.",

Guided by the thought of correspondence between human and nature, it associates the meteorological changes of nature with the state of the human body to predict the occurrence of disease in the human body and proposes a cyclical model for the prevention and treatment of diseases. (1) Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002, some scholars used this theory to test and verify the trend of SARS. Gu (2) summarized that the drought situation and the high temperature in 2000 were the two main climate factors that caused the epidemic outbreak. This phenomenon is consistent with the prediction of \"an epidemic will develop in three years\" in Yunqi theory. Since then, this theory has once again aroused people's interest and attention. In this paper, in order to build the meteorological prediction model of influenza based on Yunqi theory, we will briefl y introduce two related research background facts about our work.",

We set the baseline value and warning line value as the dividing line between groups and classifi ed the whole infl uenza data into three groups: light, moderate, and serious. The baseline and warning line settings were as follows. We did normality tests on the ILI% data during the epidemic periods of 2005-2009 (November to April of next year) by PASW statistics 17.02; if they met features of the normal distribution, we chose \u00b12s as the warning line; if not, we used the 75th percentile value as the warning line. Because the distribution of ILI% was abnormal, we took 11.8% (P75) as the baseline. The same principle was applied to the establishment of baseline values. First, the ILI% data in the non-epidemic period (May to October) was tested for normality; if they met the normal distribution, \u00b12s was chosen as a baseline value; if not, we took the 75th percentile as the baseline value. In this paper, we took 17.7% (P75) as the warning line value through statistical analysis. A non-epidemic period was under the baseline, a serious epidemic was beyond the warning line, and between these two lines was a light epidemic period.

One of the main advantages of RS theory is that it does not need any preliminary or additional information about data. Attribute reduction is a key problem in RS theory and its applications. A reduct is a minimal attribute subset of the original data that has minimal redundancy but still has the same discernibility power as all the attributes in the RS. (5) In this paper, we had 14 conditional attributes, and some of them were redundant attributes. Therefore, we used attribute reduction based on RS theory to acquire the minimal attribute subset that included six attributes. It improved the classification efficiency of support vector machine (SVM) when we used the minimal attribute subset as the input nodes of our model.",

Based on our test, we summarized that the visibility and wind speed played important roles in the infuenza epidemic. Recently, as the Chinese economic has been booming, the air pollution of the city got worse. The low level of visibility became gradually one of the accelerators to the respiratory system diseases. For example, Brunekreef, et al (8) found that exposure to pollutants such as airborne participate matter and ozone has been associated with increases in mortality and hospital admissions due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, we also found that the low wind speed would accelerate the flu epidemic. Probably, the low wind speed slows down the air fl ow and leads to a higher concentration of virus.",

We also checked the meteorological records of this week to find that the maximum wind speed was higher than usual for this period, and the instantaneous wind speed reached 50 km/h or more in 4 consecutive days. We checked the weather records at that time and found that a number of dust storms have occurred during this week in Tianjin. Therefore, we speculate that this particular error has a certain relation with the dust storms. In addition, by looking at the data for the erroneously classifi ed items 22 and 26, we suspect that these errors may be caused by the clinician's diagnosis errors since the diagnosis of influenza is easily confused with the common cold or other upper respiratory tract infectious diseases. The low reported infl uenza data will lead the RS-SVM model to misjudge the second group as the third.",
