After reading an initial portion of this book, I must admit I only skimmed the rest. I felt as if Pauling was trying to sell his ideas rather than trying to provide an unbiased view of the topic. I was not surprised when I read the correspondence between Pauling and two reviewers of his book, Beaton and Whalen.2, 3, 4 The latter were critical of his conclusions; Pauling dealt with this by claiming they misrepresented his views; they in turn made counterclaims and denied his accusations of misrepresentations.",

Among them are the following: (1) the common cold is a phenotype; it is not just a single entity with a single viral etiology; coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus have been causally identified, and other nonidentified viruses are also implicated; (2) studies do not require either a prespecified number of events per unit of time or stratification of patients into cohorts with similar histories; thus, there is no way to assess homogeneity of variance; (3) the prevalence and incidence of colds varies from year to year and by season; (4) there is no standardization of the source of vitamin C across studies; most is derived from corn, but other sources are acerola, red algae, bilberry, blueberries, chlorella, cranberries, and rose hips; (5) there is no effort to assess other dietary sources of vitamin C that may be ingested during studies; (6) when ascorbic acid concentrations in blood are measured, time of blood drawing is often not specified and it may not be consistent; (7) when a placebo group is involved, there often is no assurance that the taste attributable to ascorbic acid does not compromise the \u201cblinding\u201d of the study; (8) when sodium ascorbate is the precursor source of ascorbic acid, there are no adjustments made for how intrapatient or interpatient variations in gastric acidity may influence its reprotonation and bioavailability; and (9) vitamin C is water soluble, and excess amounts are eliminated once saturation is achieved\u2013differential effects from mega-doses are not established.",

Parental consent was obtained, and 641 children completed the 14-week study. There is no statement that assent was obtained from the children who ranged in age from 6 to 15 years. Treatment arms were ascorbic acid 500 mg twice daily (AA1) for children age 6 to 10 years, AA at 500 mg times 2 (1000 mg) twice daily (AA2) for children age 11 to 15 years, or placebo (PBO) for both cohorts matched to numbers dispensed, appearance, and, importantly, to taste. Unfortunately, there is no description of how the latter was accomplished. The study results were (1) no difference between cohorts in number of URIs; (2) there were less days with symptoms (26%) among girls and boys in the AA1 versus PBO analysis, and 33% fewer in the girls in the AA2 versus PBO analysis; (3) no differences were found for the AA2 boys; and (4) for subcohorts in whom AA levels were determined, higher AA levels were associated with symptom reduction. Curiously, the lack of value in the AA2 boys was consistent with another study published 1 year earlier.6\n",

He is essentially taking a nonparametric view of cumulative data. Although he does not use an actual sign test,20 his implication is that the sheer number of positive, small-sample reports prove his case.

Different issues arise when one is investigating prophylaxis for a contagious versus a noncontagious illness. Perhaps the prophylactic difference noted above between the effects of vitamin C on girls compared with boys can be explained as follows. Cold viruses are often transmitted through hand contact. Is it possible that, in a contained environment, girls are more likely than boys to walk hand-in-hand? If so, then perhaps spread could more readily be prevented in girls than in boys.

Colds are more frequent in the winter when vitamin D levels are generally lower, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who have lower levels of vitamin D have more URIs. Citing the role of vitamin D, Gindi et al24 found that the number of recent URIs was inversely related to serum 25(OH)D levels; this linkage was stronger in patients with preexisting respiratory tract disease. A supplementation study lasting 18 months conducted by Murdoch et al25 comparing 161 subjects given vitamin D3 tablets with 161 subjects on PBO revealed no difference in the occurrence of URIs. Again, we can only conclude that the role for vitamin D supplementation for colds and other URIs is still unresolved. One important factor may be that in the study by Murdoch et al,25 their subjects did not have deficient 25(OH)D levels. On a more positive note, the Cochrane Collaborators review of vitamin D for asthma is quite encouraging. Martineau et al26 stated that they were \u201c\u2026confident that vitamin D reduced the risk of asthma exacerbation in these trials \u2026[but] research is needed to clarify whether there is a difference in effect between adults and children and with respect to asthma severity, baseline vitamin D status and doses.\u201d",

            "text": "Before concluding this Note I want to remind our readers about a few selected facts about vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin. There are two forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). The latter is derived from fungi and plants, some of which we ingest. D2 has a few therapeutic uses (eg, hypoparathyroidism, hypophosphatemia, and rickets). Vitamin D3 is important for the incorporation of calcium into bone. We synthesize it when our skin is exposed to sunlight (UVA and UVB rays). We can also ingest vitamin D3 in vitamin supplements, mostly derived from the lanolin in sheep skin glands or from fish oil (eg, cod liver oil) or fish skin (eg, salmon).27 It is important to remember that heating may cause loss of vitamin D from foods. Cooking losses are highly variable and are determined by the specific food and the method of cooking.28 Inadequate levels of vitamin D are present in approximately one billion people worldwide.29 No age cohort or nationality is spared. From the public health perspective, this is indeed unfortunate; treatment is both straightforward and inexpensive.",
