One of the most common clinical symptoms of the infectious respiratory diseases is cough [1,2]. After being emitted through this airway defensive behaviour, coughing droplets (e.g. saliva and mucus) containing infectious pathogens can be directly transmitted and quickly further spread in the air. Epidemiology studies of influenza infections have found that coughing is even more efficient than sneezing, breathing or talking in relation to the transmission of infection [2,3]. To better assess the occupant health in associated with infection risks in public space, it is vital to obtain deep understandings of the coughing process and accurate transmit characteristics of the exhaled droplets in occupied indoor spaces.",

            "text": "The dispersion of respiratory droplets is jointly controlled by the droplet size and their interactions with the ambient airflow. When individual coughs, the size of the expelled droplets could be diversely ranged from 0.1 \u03bcm to 1000 \u03bcm [[4], [5], [6]], which is wide enough to cause both viral and bacterial infections [5]. Also, such a wide size range implies that the transport and dispersion of the droplets could be completely different [7] after expelling through the same cough. Unlike the large droplets that would quickly deposit to the floor due to high inertia and mass, small droplets would be easily carried by the local airflow and tend to suspend in the air for longer time. With potentially longer travel time and distance, the inhalable chance of smaller droplets is greatly increased. Because of this, 10 \u03bcm is used as the cut off diameter to distinguish between the respirable droplets (<10 \u03bcm) that would easily penetrate deeper into the respiratory system, and the inspirable droplets (10\u2013100 \u03bcm) that would have more impacts onto the surfaces of the upper airways [5,8]. Thus, it is of the great importance to include the full-size range of the coughing droplets when assessing the potential health risks brought by coughing. Experimental measurements from real person cough proved that the real size distribution of cough droplets was not consistent or uniform after being expelled [6,9] and the droplet diameters would be generally reduced [10,11]. Chao et al. [6] concluded that the high velocity induced by the expulsion of the air jet during coughing could promote more productions of smaller droplets (4\u201316 \u03bcm) comparing to other behaviours such as speaking. Therefore, the size distribution characterisation of the expelled droplets needs to be carefully underpinned when modelling coughing in prior to the assessment of infection risks of individuals.",

            "text": "With the importance of precisely depicting the time-dependent droplet size was raised, the evaporation process of the droplets in associate with the relative humidity (RH) of the environment was confirmed as the main cause of droplet size reduction [6,10]. When droplets consisting of water and small number of non-volatile compounds [12,13] were expelled, the water in the droplets started gradually evaporating until the solid droplet nuclei with smaller equilibrium diameters are formed by the remaining non-volatile components. Mathematical models were developed to realise the size-time relations under different temperature and humidity conditions [12,14,15]. Due to the complexity of integrating the evaporation process and the dispersion process, most existing studies applied simplified mathematical models to simulate the evaporation process. The inhomogeneous humidity field induced by the evaporating droplets was either ignored or simulated with over-simplified transportable scalar models [12,14,15]. Since the inhomogeneous vapour concentration would significantly affect the droplet trajectories by changing the function of time and droplets size, it is important to fully address the inhomogeneous water vapour concentration on droplet evaporation. With that in need, a multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian approach that explicitly solves the continuity equation of the water vapour was proposed in the previous study [16] to enhance the mathematical models for modelling evaporation process of coughing.",

            "text": "Although mathematical models of modelling the droplets evaporation were reported in the literature, existing studies on cough droplet dispersion in indoor spaces were mostly conducted without considering the droplet evaporation and the varying dominant mechanism of droplets movement induced by the size change. Most studies used particles with equilibrium droplet nuclei diameters to represent the droplet size after the size reduction due to evaporation [17,18], since the evaporation process took place very quickly for respirable droplets (less than 10 \u03bcm) under ideal condition (0% RH) [12,14]. However, the droplet evaporation process is inhomogeneous. The same process could take more than 100s for droplets with initial diameter of 100 \u03bcm under an opposite ideal condition of 100% RH [14]. To further test the impact of droplet size and RH change on evaporation process, our previous research [16] conducted several case studies with combinations of various ambient RH (10%\u201390%), exhaled humidity and droplets amount. The outcomes demonstrated that the dynamic behaviours of droplets were significantly affected by evaporation and RH, including the change of droplet dispersion, promote increase of pathogen mass carried by find and ultrafine droplets. The evaporation process could take from 1 s to as long as 10 s for larger droplets ranged from 10 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm, under a more realistic ambient condition of 50% RH. With such long-time span, the size distribution pattern of the droplets would be completely reformed. Also, the inhomogeneous vapour concentration would significantly affect the droplet trajectories by changing the function of time and droplets size. Therefore, it is essential to consider the simultaneous droplets size reduction by the evaporation process and to fully address the inhomogeneous water vapour concentration on droplet evaporation when assessing the trajectory and concentration-based infection risks of respiratory droplets in indoor spaces.",

However, this essential factor: the thermal flow in indoor environment from human body heat, was generally overlooked when integrating the droplets evaporation into indoor environment. Since investigating the cough droplets evaporation process would inevitably increase the computational cost, the computational domains were very restricted in most existing studies [12,14,16]. Cough was generally released through a narrow surface imitating the mouth only, whereas human model was either completely removed or overly simplified (i.e. cylinders and blocks). Clearly, the corresponding thermal plume induced by the human metabolic body heat could not be captured properly by these approaches. However, the thermal plume was reported as a very important factor on local airflow and contaminant fields from several indoor micro-environment studies [21,22]. With seating posture, the metallic body heat would generate two major ascending thermal plumes (on top of the head and in front of the main torso, respectively), while realistic computational thermal manikin (CTM) is required to capture these features [20,23]. With coughing behaviour, these thermal plumes, especially the one in front of the main torso, would consistently interact with the coughing jet flow both during the coughing and after it. This interaction would not only change the local airflow distribution in the vicinity of the human body, but certainly affect the local evaporation factors (air pressure, temperature and etc.). It was proved by the previous studies that even small changes of the local airflow would cause very different transport trajectories of the particles and droplets [7,20]. Most importantly, since the ascending thermal plume was capable of carrying contaminants from the near-floor level into the breathing zone [22], the inhalability and infection risks could be significantly enlarged after considering the human body thermal effect.",

To increase the efficiency, only half of the chamber with dimensions of 4 m \u00d7 1 m \u00d7 3 m was created due to the symmetric distribution characteristics of the airflow field. The ambient conditions including air temperature and humidity were considered by setting an opening at the opposite end of the chamber to the droplet injection plane. Two representative droplet sizes (i.e. 10 \u03bcm and 1000 \u03bcm) were simulated under the relative humidity of 0% and 90%, respectively. The predicted time-dependent droplets diameter reduction was compared to the theoretical calculations by Redrow et al. [12] and Wei and Li [25]. It can be seen from Fig. 1, the numerical predictions from this study yielded very good agreement to the reported data in the existing literature. The dramatic differences on the evaporation rate were accurately captured using the proposed multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian model, while the impacts of the RH change on the evaporation process were also successfully predicted. Although 0% and 90% RHs were not realistic room humidity condition, successful prediction of evaporation process at both high and low ends of RH proved the robustness of the proposed model.",

The mesh independency test was conducted using the grid convergence index (GCI) [28] and the y + values at CTM surfaces [27]. It was achieved at 2.3 million with the 90% mesh quality above 0.8 and the maximum y + values below 3 at the CTM surfaces. Further refining the mesh did not contribute considerable differences of air velocity profiles, droplets mass fraction or droplets diameter reduction. The airflow field was solved using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations along with the Boussinesq approximation for the thermal buoyance flows. High-resolution advection scheme was applied to achieve better robustness and accuracy of the advection terms, while the RNG k-\u03b5 model was applied for the air turbulence due to its reliable performance in predicting indoor airflows [29,30]. The independence of the droplet trajectory numbers was also tested and achieved at 25,000. Transient simulation was conducted with adaptive time steps to match the simultaneous gradient change of airflow and droplet fields. Very small initial time-steps of 0.01 s were used at the beginning of the cough with maximum increase ratio of 1.1. The total droplet tracking time was 40 s, which took 60 h to finish each simulation using a workstation with 40 CPU cores (2.8G Hz Intel Xeon) and 128 GB RAM.",

Since the radiation was not considered in this study, a convective heat load of 36 W was applied to the seating CTM in the chamber. The detailed heat load distribution at each segment of the CTM was given in Table 1\n. An equivalent heat flux of 22.83 W/m2 was applied on the CTM surface, which was very similar to the published experimental measurements [31,32] and numerical results [33,34], as compared in Table 2\n.",

Since the cough flow rate was generally high at the first half of the coughing period (0 s\u20130.25 s), the coughing velocity was also expected to be significant during the same period, in which the maximum velocity of the cough flow reached 21.7 m/s. Existing experiment measurements in the literature also verified that the maximum cough velocity could be as high as 22 m/s [9,17]. Due to such strong cough jet, the cough flow quickly travelled to nearly 0.5 m away from the mough within 0.25 s, followed by a much slower development to 0.72 m at the end of the cough. The maximum cough velocity was then significantly reduced to 1.2 m/s (only about one-twenties of the peak value) at the end of the cough.",

However, the interactions between these two flows, especially the impact of the thermal flow could become more obvious and dominating once the cough flow was weakened at the end and after the cough, as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, detailed comparisons with and without considering the manikin body heat were focused after the cough (t > 0.5 s) when the cough jet flow became weaker and further dispersed into the surrounding air.

Since the cough flow still remained relatively high momentum just after the cough (t = 1s), the cough flow pattern did not show significant differences with and without considering the human thermal effect. However, with the time went on, the thermal plume became more dominating. The cough flow was clearly brought up by the ascending thermal plume and eventually became part of the long-lasting thermal plume when considering the human body heat, whereas the cough flow continued to travel downward and gradually dispersed in the case without body heat. To further quantify the differences caused by the thermal plume, velocity profiles were compared at two selected lines adjacent to the manikin with same incline angle, as provided in Fig. 6b. Velocity deviations can be clearly noticed at heights above 1 m, in which the two ascending thermal plume started merging and thereby the effect of the thermal plume were maximised. As a result, after considering the body heat, the vertical component of the air velocity was considerably increased and led to a higher overall velocity profiles in the thermal affect region.",

For very large droplets (>100 \u03bcm), the evaporation process did not finish or even start due to the early deposition of these large droplets. The reduced droplet nuclei sizes were approximately 26% of their initial size, which were vital when investigating the droplet dispersion and transport characteristics. Consequently, some inspirable droplets (10 \u03bcm - 100 \u03bcm) turned into respirable droplets (<10 \u03bcm) and thereby the inhabitability and infectivity of these droplets would be different after considering the evaporation process. In terms of the thermal effect, although the local temperature in the vicinity of the body was increased by the body heat, it had very limited boost on the size reduction of the droplets. The evaporation process was not significantly affected by the local temperature change.

On the other hand, the trajectories were almost identical for large droplets (>100 \u03bcm) and the effects of thermal flow was minimised due to their high inertia and mass.

Since the above findings revealed that the trajectories of droplets larger than 100 \u03bcm were almost identical with and without the human body heat, the extreme large droplets (larger than 200 \u03bcm) were not included in the follow discussions. It is worth noting that the collision of droplets could lead to a different droplets size distribution. To better match the classifications with the experimental data, the droplets were assumed not colliding with each other in this study. For future model improvement, experimental observations of droplet collisions using high-resolution images are in great demand. With small droplets that could be potentially lifted by the ascending thermal flow, the instantaneous droplets velocity was compared between the cases without and with the human body heat, as shown in Fig. 9\n. It was obvious that the time-dependent vertical velocity profiles were completely different for the droplets between 3.5 \u03bcm and 20 \u03bcm. Almost all these droplets obtained an upward velocity against the gravity after the cough with human body heat. The opposite vertical velocity of droplets reflected very different transport characteristics of the droplets before and after considering the human thermal effect. For relatively large droplets (35 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm), the instantaneous velocities of droplets were not significantly changed after considering the thermal flow. However, the active droplets travelling time of these droplets were clearly different with and without considering the thermal effect. The 50 \u03bcm droplets quickly deposited to the ground within 10 s before considering the human body heat, whilst the same group droplets took another 8 s longer to deposit after considering the human body heat. That it to say, the droplets (50 \u03bcm) travelled in the room nearly twice longer due to the ascending thermal plume adjacent to the manikin. The impacts of the body heat was more critical on droplets of 35 \u03bcm. These droplets were fully deposited approximately 12 s after cough without human body heat, whilst the same group of droplets suspended in the air rather than depositing to the ground due to the dominant effect of the ascending thermal flow. Consequently, the time of these droplets in the air was tremendously increased. Therefore, the human body heat significantly affected the one of the most crucial droplet dispersion parameter: the droplets travelling time. This impact would be vital when assessing droplets trajectory-based health risks in indoor spaces.",

Fig. 10\ndemonstrated the droplets travel displacement along the vertical direction where the buoyancy driven thermal plume mainly developed. The median displacement of each droplet classification was added to quantify the profile. The median curves yielded from droplets sizes of both 3.5 \u03bcm and 12 \u03bcm showed significantly different travel displacements of droplets without and with considering the human thermal effect. Although the travel displacements were almost identical during the coughing period, the plotted curves immediately departure away after the cough between the compared cases. The transport directions of these small droplets were completely changed after including the buoyancy driven thermal flow. Instead of gradually going downward, most of these droplets travelled upward above their initial release position and was eventually brought up into the breathing zone (\u00b10.2 m from the mouth) of the occupant. For 50 \u03bcm droplets, the ascending thermal flow also significantly increased travelling time and delayed deposition. With later deposition, the travel distance of 50 \u03bcm, especially along the horizontal direction could be increased and the droplets would be able to travel further away from the source.",

The predicted outcomes revealed that the small droplets up to 20 \u03bcm were easily brought up by the buoyancy driven thermal plume. As a result, these droplets travelled further upward and would have very high chance to entry the breathing zone of the occupant. Although the thermal plume might not be strong enough to lift the larger droplets (\u226550 \u03bcm) into the breathing zone, it significantly delayed the deposition time of these large droplets as found in Fig. 10 and thereby the travel distance would be significantly increase. With further travel distance and longer travel time, the cough droplets would potentially cause higher health risks, especially under densely occupied environment where the thermal effect of occupants would be dramatically enlarged. Consequently, the risks of inhaling these droplets would be significantly increased and the inhalable size range of droplets could also be widened in real situations. Therefore, it is essential to include the thermal effect of human body into consideration when assessing the infection risks and air quality in indoor spaces.",

The inhalable chance of small droplets classified from 3.5 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm was dramatically increased.
