Mediators responsible for hypersensitivity reactions are released from mast cells. An important preformed mediator of allergic reactions found in these cells is histamine. Specific allergens or the calcium ionophore 48/80 induce release of histamine from mast cells. The histamine concentration can be determined with the o-phthalaldehyde reaction.",

Unlike the proliferative action of SphK1, the isoenzyme SphK2 has been shown to possess antiproliferative and proapoptotic action. Both kinases have been cloned and functionally characterized (Kohama et al. 1998; Liu et al. 2000, 2003; Nava et al. 2000; Olivera et al. 2000; Igarashi et al. 2003; Paugh et al. 2003; Sanchez et al. 2003; Billich et al. 2005; D\u00f6ll et al. 2005; Hait et al. 2005; Kharel et al. 2005; Okada et al. 2005; De Palma et al. 2006; Zemann et al. 2006; Gao and Smith 2011; Neubauer and Pitson 2013; Tonellli et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013; Ceccom et al. 2014; Plano et al. 2014; Shen et al. 2014; Tamashiro et al. 2014; Tous et al. 2014).

Injections of complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant into the rat paw induce inflammation as primary lesion with a maximum after 3\u20135 days. Secondary lesions occur after a delay of approximately 11\u201312 days which are characterized by inflammation of non-injected sites (hindleg, forepaws, ears, nose, and tail) and a decrease of weight and immune responses. The procedure has been modified by several authors in order to differentiate between anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity (e.g., Perper et al. 1971). Anti-inflammatory compounds do not inhibit secondary lesions, which are prevented or diminished by immunosuppressive agents. Two protocols, termed \u201cpreventative\u201d (or \u201cprophylactic\u201d) and \u201ctherapeutic\u201d (or \u201cestablished\u201d) adjuvant arthritis, have gained wide usage for assessing a drug\u2019s potential anti-arthritic activity (Schorlemmer et al. 1999).",

Paw volumes of both sides and body weight are recorded on the day of injection, whereby paw volume is measured plethysmographically with equipment as described in the paw edema tests. On day 5, the volume of the injected paw is measured again, indicating the primary lesion and the influence of therapeutic agents on this phase. The severity of the induced adjuvant disease is followed by measurement of the non-injected paw (secondary lesions) with a plethysmometer.

The mixture is stirred 18 h at room temperature and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 1 h.

Fetal human articular cartilage proteoglycan digested with chondroitinase ABC (Hascall and Heineg\u00e5rd 1974) is used to induce arthritis in female BALB/c mice. The mice are sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of 100 \u03bcg of chondroitinase ABC-treated proteoglycan in 100 \u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and in Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant in a 1:1 emulsion. They are reinjected twice more with the antigen in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant after 1 and 3 weeks. All BALB/c mice immunized with human articular cartilage proteoglycan develop arthritis in diarthrodial joints after the third antigen injection. Sera from mice with progressive polyarthritis are tested for antibodies to arthritogenic proteoglycans during weeks 12\u201318 of immunization. The limbs of all mice are examined daily to record clinical arthritic changes. Swelling and redness, as the first symptoms of arthritis, and the thickness (diameter) of the knee, ankle (intermalleolar diameter), wrist, and the dorsovolar thickness of the paw are recorded three times a week. The most objective joint diameter is the intermalleolar one. The animals are treated with test drug or vehicle for 12 weeks and serum samples taken by retro-orbital puncture for determination of antibodies to proteoglycans. Seven weeks later, the mice are sacrificed, and limbs, tails, and lumbar spine are fixed, decalcified, and embedded in paraffin for histological examination.",

The immunological involvement in the pathogenesis of pristane-induced arthritis was studied by several authors (Bedwell et al. 1987; Thompson et al. 1990; Ghoraishian et al. 1993; Nishikaku et al. 1994; Vingsbo et al. 1996; Stasiuk et al. 1997; Morgan et al. 2004). Moreover, the genetic basis for the susceptibility to pristane-induced arthritis was studied (Lu et al. 2002; Olofsson et al. 2003; Brenner et al. 2005; Jensen et al. 2006). Not only in mice but also in rats arthritis could be induced by pristane injections (Vingsbo et al. 1996; Zheng et al. 2002, 2003; Webster et al. 2003; Holmberg et al. 2006).",

Typically, the sufferer has drooping eyelids, a blank facial expression, and weak, hesitant speech. This is due to the formation of autoantibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The formation of autoantibodies to acetylcholine\u2019s receptor leads to a gradual destruction of the receptors in skeletal muscles that receive nerve impulses and initiate muscle contractions. As a result, affected muscles fail to respond or react only weakly to nerve signals.",

The animals display symptoms of myasthenia (electrophysiological evidence of altered neuromuscular function) and detectable antireceptor antibodies. The severity of the disease can vary, but most animals display, at the very least, a weakness and fatigability of foot grip. The disease gradually leads to abnormal gait and eventually the inability of the animals to walk or even right themselves.",

Various organs are used for allogenic transplantation in animal experiments, such as skin pieces (Schorlemmer et al. 1993), kidney (Lee 1967; K\u00fcchle et al. 1991), rat heart, rat small intestine (Xiao et al. 1994; Zhang et al. 2014), and corneal buttons (Coupland et al. 1994).
