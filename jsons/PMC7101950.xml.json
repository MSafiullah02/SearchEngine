IL-8 is a strong chemotactic cytokine that activates the inflammatory cells by the recruitment of neutrophils, mononuclear phagocytes, mast cells, and T cells [4, 5]. IL-8 is involved in the initiation of the acute and chronic inflammatory process [6]. It is implicated in the pathogenesis of several pulmonary diseases like bronchial asthma [7], Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) [8], severe infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [9], and viral bronchiolitis [10]. Various reports have also described the capacity of Th2, Th-9, and Th-17 cells to induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines as the IL-8, which contribute to the expansion of neutrophils to the airway epithelial cells of patients with asthma [3, 11\u201313]. An increased level of IL-8 was observed in Broncho-alveolar fluid (BALF), sputum, and endobronchial biopsies of patients with asthma [14, 15]. Furthermore, a higher IL-8 serum levels were observed for severe patients with asthma that suggested that IL-8 plays an important role in asthma severity [16]. Therefore, IL-8 might protect against the development of atopic asthma by the inhibition of IgE production [17].",

Fifteen IL8 polymorphisms were characterized to date and only two were reported to be associated with altered IL-8 mRNA levels [19]. The IL-8-251A/T (rs4073) polymorphism located on the promoter region, was reported to be associated with an increased IL-8 level. The IL-8 + 781C/T (rs2227306) located within the first intron, was described to promote gene transcription and regulation [20]. Recently, genetic association studies showed that these polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility to inflammatory diseases as RSV bronchiolitis, ARDS, lung cancer, and asthma [7, 9, 21\u201323].",

In fact, human bronchial epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and airway smooth muscle cells recruit neutrophils into the airways by the release of IL-8 and/or other chemokines [13, 31].

It has been reported that the two polymorphisms rs4073 and rs2227306 influenced the transcriptional activity of the IL8. Firstly, the expression levels of IL-8 (mRNA and protein) might be influenced by other factors than the only presence of IL-8 variants and the expression of these SNPs might have other effects like the alteration of the expression of a more distant gene in particular SNP situated in the promoter region. Secondly, when SNPs were not studied within the exact haplotype blocks (some SNPs in the same region are in LD with others SNPs), we cannot conclude about the real effect of IL-8 SNPs on the expression of IL-8.",

Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that this polymorphism increases the production of IL-8. Lee et al. [39] have described that the rs4073 T allele possessed a transcriptional activity twofold to fivefold stronger than the rs4073 A allele, which contributed to the high IL\u20138 amount as described. Additionally, it has been shown that the IL8 promoter DNA sequence around the position\u2013251 was conformed to the binding motif of C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) [41, 42]. Then, this functional effect might be related to the fact that the nuclear factors such as C/EBP and GATA bind with high affinity to the IL-8 transcription regulatory sites in the presence of the T allele. However, experimental results suggest that the differences in IL-8 expression are not linked directly to the rs4073 polymorphism [36]. Therefore, other SNPs could be implicated in the transcriptional and translational activities.",
