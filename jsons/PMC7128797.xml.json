The summer was considered a low season of pharyngotonsillitis and therefore not included, the overall Centor score was relatively low, and the clinical assessment of the patients was not guided, all of which can be considered limitations of the study. This, however, reflects the patient group and practice in Swedish PHCs and is therefore considered relevant. The study was powered to be able to detect a significant difference in the presence of F. necrophorum in pharyngotonsillitis patients, compared to a control group.

The Centor score for these patients was higher than for patients with non-GAS infections, supporting the continuous use of this score to predict the presence of GAS [5]. There was a large diversity of the viruses contributing to the aetiology, and the temporal variation resulted in influenza B (only period 1) being the most common viral cause of pharyngotonsillitis in this age group. Respiratory viruses were also detected in the control group. This might be seen as over-reporting of the presence of these viruses due to the high sensitivity of PCR. However, we would argue, rather, that it reflects asymptomatic infections or prolonged shedding of viruses. Despite the unbiased inclusion, as many as 15% of the patients were culture-positive for F. necrophorum, while only 3% of the healthy controls were positive for this bacterium. Previously, Aliyu et al. described patients, aged 5 months to 79 years, with a sore throat where a routine culture was obtained, and found F. necrophorum in 10% of these samples using PCR, but did not find any F. necrophorum among 100 healthy controls [12]. Amess reported 4.9% of routine throat cultures in the age group <1\u201388 years to be positive for F. necrophorum, with the highest prevalence in patients ages 11\u201325 years (9.8%) [14]. In patients 18\u201332 years of age with \u201cnon-streptococcal tonsillitis,\u201d Jensen et al. identified F. necrophorum with PCR in almost half of the samples, and in lower amounts among 21% of the controls [13]. The use of samples from routine microbiology and \u201cnon-streptococcal\u201d samples will tend, contrary to the prospective open inclusion used in the present study, to over-report the pathogen studied. Fusobacterium necrophorum was the only microorganism found in 14 patients. These patients were not necessarily less ill than the patients with GAS only, but received a lower Centor score due to a higher presence of cough. Although the power of the study was not calculated to rule out associations between signs and symptoms, this study could not find any association between age [14], recent primary EBV infection [25], or recurrent sore throat [26] and the detection of F. necrophorum, as suggested by others. However, smoking and coating of the tonsils increased the likelihood of detecting F. necrophorum. Importantly, some of the controls were positive for F. necrophorum, and the presence of this bacterium is thus not strictly associated with symptoms. Among nearly two-thirds of patients with a presence of F. necrophorum, another microorganism was found (both GAS and viruses). The growth, and possibly also the pathogenic potential of F. necrophorum, may thus be facilitated by an underlying inflammation.",

Both Centor and Bank et al. have suggested that a broad antibiotic treatment of tonsillitis could prevent the few cases of severe infection (i.e. Lemi\u00e8rre syndrome) [27], [28]. We consider this suggestion premature, as the finding of F. necrophorum in a predisposing tonsillitis has not been shown to be of importance for the development of Lemi\u00e8rre syndrome, and as the best treatment option of F. necrophorum has not yet been established. More studies are warranted to further define the importance of F. necrophorum in tonsillitis, establish a standard for how to handle the finding of F. necrophorum in pharyngotonsillitis, and determine whether antibiotic treatment is needed. We urge diagnostic laboratories to consider the methods needed to find this bacterium in throat swabs (i.e. PCR-based methodology or anaerobic culture for 4 days) [13].",
