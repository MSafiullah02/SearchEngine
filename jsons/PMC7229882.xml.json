First, nearly two-thirds of active ingredients for generic drugs are made in China, where illness and mandatory business shutdowns have interrupted the production and export of drugs [7]. Medications manufactured in India are also affected by illness and quarantine. That nation has, for the moment, banned exportation of several medications, including hydroxychloroquine.",

            "text": "In addition to supply factors, domestic demand is anticipated to drive shortages of key medications. Because many COVID-19 patients require mechanical ventilation, we anticipate high demand for sedatives, analgesics, and paralytics. Sedatives and analgesics are commonly affected by drug shortages, even prior to the current pandemic. Demand has risen for sedatives by 51% and for analgesics by 67% in the month of March. Both have had fill rates of less than 100%, setting up concerns for impending shortages [8]. Insufficient sedation may result in patient discomfort and unplanned self-extubation of mechanically ventilated patients, which is harmful to patients and places staff at risk of disease transmission. Multifocal pneumonia and sepsis will require treatment with antibiotics and vasopressors, which have also already been affected by drug shortages [2, 3]. Although chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine recently received emergency use authorization from the Strategic National Stockpile by the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 treatment, there are already reported shortages of these medications. This shortage is caused by a combination of importation restriction and increased demand, caused in part by hoarding of medications, clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, and off-label use. Although wholesalers have responded to hoarding by allocating products based on past purchase history, hospitals surging to accommodate 2\u20135 times the number of patients will still need a proportional increase in medications [8]. As a result, patients who are on hydroxychloroquine for autoimmune diseases have reported difficulty obtaining their chronic medications [9]. Because nebulizer treatments can aerosolize and promote coronavirus transmission, increased demand for metered dose inhalers has impacted availability of these items as well. Additionally, patients with underlying lung disease may have worsening of their disease in the setting of COVID-19, which may further increase demand [10].",

When a first-line medication is not available, therapeutic alternatives may be less effective or more toxic. Substitution of a less familiar product can result in errors in several ways. A dosing error may occur when the usual concentration is unavailable and a different concentration is substituted or when pharmacies must compound products previously available in a pre-mixed form [12\u201314]. Although some product can be conserved by using vials multiple times to minimize waste, this practice can compromise sterility [15]. Information technology resources are required to safeguard against medication errors by making changes in the electronic health records or barcode scanners; however, these resources may be in short supply in the setting of a pandemic.",
