The stated objective of these exercises is to \u2018rehearse\u2019 a disaster situation in order to better prepare for it (Armstrong 2012). Actors in a simulation treat the expected disaster as if it had happened in order to immerse themselves in the reality it should produce (Seligman, Weller, Puett & Simon 2008). As such, simulations offer opportunities for social anthropology to combine science and technology studies with the ethnography of rituals. Enacting the imaginary of coming catastrophes, simulation creates an extraordinary setting for performances separated from ordinary life.",

Both techniques use worst\u2010case scenarios, written by disaster\u2010management professionals trained in fiction writing. If simulation is a regular activity for scientists working on computers, it also shapes the stage of extraordinary performances for ordinary citizens involved in drills (Sismondo 1999). However, the distinction between these two forms of simulation is not between reality and fiction, since those who write scenarios for these two kinds of simulation constantly play on the shift between virtual and actual. They rely on the memory of previous catastrophes and the anticipation of future disasters to inform a realistic engagement in the present of the simulation. If scenarios are considered as shared forms or schemes of action, simulations can be described as ritual performances displaying relations between humans and nonhumans in extraordinary settings.",

            "text": "This article starts from observed simulations of an avian influenza pandemic in China. Influenza viruses emerging from birds have been considered as potentially causing future pandemics, because birds (particularly waterfowl in south China) have been identified as the reservoir in which flu viruses mutate before spreading successfully between humans (Shortridge & Stuart\u2010Harris 1982). Among other techniques such as early warning systems and stockpiling vaccines, preparing for the next pandemics therefore involves simulating the transmission of pathogens from birds to humans (Caduff 2015; Lakoff 2007). Arguing that a human pandemic is a symmetrical threat to the extinction of a bird species, I then consider another bird disease for which Chinese experts organize simulations: botulism. This disease, which doesn't affect humans, is considered a potential disaster for black\u2010faced spoonbills because it kills migratory birds when they concentrate in wetlands on their flyways (Wilson 2010: 76).",

Global health has been extended to animals and the environment \u2013 an approach called \u2018One World, One Health\u2019 \u2013 thus requiring an interspecies approach towards the ethical issues involved (Hinchliffe 2015). One of the most debated questions in the anthropology of pandemic preparedness is the adequacy of the notion of sacrifice to describe how some populations are separated from others and killed or left to die for the sake of public health. In exercises of triage, some patients are prioritized over others through the framework of urgency (Nguyen 2010; Redfield 2013). In the management of human populations, migrant workers are considered as a threat by educated experts using viral connectivity as a metaphor of modernity (MacPhail 2014; Mason 2016). In the management of zoonotic pathogens, the notion of sacrifice seems even more obvious, since animals are massively killed to eradicate the reservoir of emerging infectious diseases; and in the management of wild animals, some individuals are sacrificed to protect the species (Van Dooren 2014). Other descriptions, however, have been proposed of the entangled relations between animals and humans in the \u2018hotspots\u2019 or \u2018sentinel devices\u2019 where emerging pathogens connect them in productive ways (Brown & Kelly 2014; Fearnley 2015; Keck & Lakoff 2013; Lezaun & Porter 2015; Lowe 2010). While sacrifice separates some living beings from others to eradicate pathogens, sentinels instantiate relations between living beings through the anticipation of future pathogens.",

To support this argument, I rely on the anthropology of hunting societies, by contrast with pastoral societies. While public health relies on pastoral techniques of power combining sacrifice and surveillance to contain the threats coming from outside in a population (Foucault 1981), the \u2018One World, One Health\u2019 approach uses techniques from birdwatchers and wildlife managers to monitor data about changing relations between humans and animals.1 Whereas pastoral techniques are asymmetrical, relying on the pastor's superior gaze over the flock manifested by sacrifice, cynegetic techniques are symmetrical, as hunters and prey constantly change perspectives when displayed in rituals (Chamayou 2012).",

But they don't take the perspective of animals because they consider simulations as pastoral techniques of biopower, therefore bypassing what the anthropology of hunting societies shows about ritual action. In this article, I define a cynegetic practice of simulation that is always mixed with forms of planning, combining two different forms of anticipation. I call \u2018avian preparedness\u2019 this mix of cynegetic becoming\u2010animal and pastoralist care for populations initiated by microbiologists, considered both as \u2018virus hunters\u2019 (Perrey 2012) and as \u2018microbe farmers\u2019 (Caduff 2015: 76).",

            "text": "To analyse simulations of bird diseases, I combine the notion of reverse scenario (Schull 2015) with the notion of reflexive ritual. Pandemic or extinction scenarios, I argue, connect humans and animals in realistic ways to play on the imagination of what could happen if a pathogen emerges. Using animal reservoirs as mirrors in which anxieties about pandemics are reflected, humans exchange their perspectives with animals in an imagined future where their relations are reversed. Simulations can thus be situated in an anthropological space between play and ritual. Roberte Hamayon (2015: 97) has called \u2018simulation\u2019 the way shamans in Mongolian hunting societies imitate the movements of animals in a ritualized setting to prepare for the uncertainties of hunting. In an article entitled \u2018Dissimulation and simulation as forms of religious reflexivity\u2019, Michael Houseman proposes to move away from a definition of ritual as a collective action based on a shared secret to study \u2018the emergent properties of ritual simulation generally\u2019 (2002: 77). He draws on two cases taken from hunting societies of Central Africa, one in which male novices are symbolically killed and the other in which a goat is actually sacrificed. He asks: how do participants come to believe in a series of speeches and actions \u2013 the novice's death and the goat's consent to sacrifice \u2013 that are obviously false? He answers that ritual action creates an extraordinary space of reflexivity with regard to the ordinary relations that constitute the group. While the ritual for male novices is a \u2018dissimulation\u2019, in which the relations between initiated and uninitiated are constantly reversed in such a way that the moment of death becomes uncertain, the ritual of goat sacrifice, says Houseman, is a simulation of consent, in which the silencing of the goat through the consumption of herbs mimics the consent of male hunters to their initiation. The ritual is reflexive in the sense that it stages the condition of the ritual itself \u2013 the secrecy known by initiators and unknown by the initiated \u2013 through the manipulations of daily relations between humans and nonhumans, whose asymmetries are reflected as in a mirror.",

These three territories have competed at the global level since the SARS crisis in 2003 to be the best \u2018sentinel posts\u2019 where pandemic pathogens coming from China can be detected (Abraham 2007). As hubs for the intense circulation of persons and commodities in Asia, but also as repositories of Chinese traditional relations between humans and birds, they have prepared for the catastrophic effects of a bird flu outbreak. But while the Hong Kong government regularly culls its poultry and sends warning signals from the Chinese border, Taiwan and Singapore rarely had to cull their poultry and rather invested in scenarios for the simulation of pandemic. Taiwan, on the other side, shares with Hong Kong the monitoring of black\u2010faced spoonbills, considered as one of Asia's most threatened and charismatic species.",

By looking at the relations between humans and birds in these three contexts through their common exposure to emerging pathogens, this article also analyses the relations between national states in Asia as they have to manage a common disaster. Since simulations of bird diseases connect relations at different scales, from the microbiological to the biopolitical, this article combines science studies, ethnography of rituals, and political economy through an anthropology of \u2018more\u2010than\u2010human\u2019 relations (Helmreich & Kirksey 2010; Kohn 2013; Sagan 2011).",

But after the publications of Gavin's team showed the role of the Chinese poultry industry in the emergence of these new strains (Smith et al. 2006), the Guangdong authorities had severely restricted Hong Kong virologists\u2019 access to these samples. Gavin then moved to Singapore in 2012, where he had more freedom to continue his fundamental research, and more funding from international institutions. He had shifted from the sentinel post, where the new strains of avian influenza emerged, such as the H5N1 virus in 1997 (Keck 2010), to a place where he could simulate the evolution of flu viruses in high\u2010tech computers.

The first one, entitled \u2018Dating the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses\u2019, was published just after the emergence of the H1N1 virus in Mexico in April 2009. It showed that genetic components of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus circulated among pigs and humans as early as 1911, thus challenging the commonly held view that Spanish flu jumped from birds to humans in 1918. In the context of the new H1N1 \u2018swine flu\u2019, this article stressed the need for intensified surveillance of pigs to detect emerging flu viruses before they become pandemic. \u2018If future pandemics arise in this manner\u2019, Gavin and his team concluded, \u2018this interval may provide the best opportunity for health authorities to intervene to mitigate the effects of a pandemic or even to abort its emergence\u2019 (Smith, Bahl, Vijaykrishna, et al. 2009: 11712).",

In the construction of a phylogenetic tree, biological knowledge is necessary because some correlations proposed by the computer make no sense in an evolutionary perspective, as they can be due to errors in sequencing or genetic deletion. To decide which correlations to take into account and which to consider as irrelevant, virologists use other software (such as Bootstrap, Jukes Cantor, or Tamura) providing the probability of correlations based on a given scenario. As for other techniques of preparedness, probability is not enough to simulate a coming disaster: it requires a work of imagination (Lakoff 2007). Peter Galison has shown that computer simulation emerged in the field of particle physics as a \u2018subculture\u2019 among experimenters and theoreticians under the \u2018Monte Carlo\u2019 programme funded by NASA in the 1960s to simulate a nuclear explosion. Simulation replaces experimentation when the data needed for the theory are too numerous and complex to be processed with traditional instruments, creating a \u2018trading zone\u2019 in which different professional groups share a common language or \u2018pidgin\u2019 (Galison 1997: 50). Similarly, bioinformatics produces new images shared by microbiologists, computer scientists, and public health executives in the anticipation of epidemics. Software such as Bootstrap can be considered as an accessory or decoy to trap the live bird viruses through the sequences that have been stored in Genbank.",

But I was mostly intrigued by the way Gavin and his team turned sequences into images through an anticipatory mode of reasoning that I call \u2018reverse scenario\u2019. Natasha Schull proposes the term in her work with on\u2010line gamblers, to describe the way they \u2018cope with the necessarily uncertain futures of any hand by returning them to a point in the past and confronting them with a branching diversity of outcomes that might have emerged from it\u2019 (2015: 56). It applies well to the practices of \u2018virus hunters\u2019 who use \u2018reverse engineering\u2019 to reconstruct potentially pandemic pathogens such as the 1918 H1N1 virus (Caduff 2015: 105; Napier 2003: 2). Just as a gambler speculates how much he could have won if he had played this or that card, Gavin imagines what could have happened if the H1N1 virus had been detected in pigs prior to 1918 or 2009. Virus sequencing allows him to trace potential connections between birds, pigs, and humans, and to imagine other futures of cross\u2010species transmission. Yet we don't know how birds (and pigs) are actually involved in the construction of pandemic scenarios, because we don't see how virologists take virus samples from birds. We thus need to turn from desktop simulations to \u2018real\u2010ground\u2019 exercises organized by public health officials and birdwatchers.",

Mr Wong was a former policeman in charge of organizing exercises for emerging infectious diseases in hospitals. The first national exercise for influenza in Singapore was organized in 2006, after the first cases of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of H5N1 were suspected in Thailand. Called \u2018Sparrowhawk\u2019, it was organized in two stages: a table\u2010top discussion and assessment of pandemic response plans among six hospitals in the country between April and June; and a practical exercise on 21\u20102 July, in which the six designated hospitals had to manage potential patients and share information about their circulation. Mr Wong explained that a thousand people were involved in the real\u2010ground drill, mostly volunteers from grassroots organizations and nurses from training institutions. While patients moved from one hospital to another, some hospitals assessed the behaviour of others and gradually raised the number of casualties. The main question, according to Mr Wong, was: \u2018If there are 200 casualties in one hospital, which resources do they need?\u2019",

On 17 July 2013, the Agriculture and Veterinary Authority (AVA) organized a drill in one of the poultry slaughterhouses on the border with Malaysia. There are no authorized poultry farms on the territory and only five chicken farms for eggs, which constrains Singapore to import and slaughter 40 million live chickens from Malaysia every year.

I was also intrigued by the fact that while the Hong Kong government organized many such exercises on the human side, they had never simulated bird flu in poultry farms, because outbreaks occurred regularly in farms on its territory. While Singapore authorities actually killed poultry for a disease that remained virtual, Hong Kong authorities simulated the transmission of bird flu from chickens to humans because it was already circulating among birds.

Rather, simulations display openly contradictions that public health administrations have to solve, often by the use of sacrifice in operations of culling (of infected poultry) or triage (of suspected patients). They create a tension between two techniques of power: those of biologists and simulators who follow viruses as they mutate between species, which I describe as cynegetic, and those of public health officials who have to protect some populations against others, which I call pastoral. To support this hypothesis, I will now turn to simulations organized by birdwatchers.

This practice finds its roots in aristocratic practices of opening the cages of birds who sang well, and was codified in Taoist rituals as a specific sequence of releasing a live animal; but it has developed massively in recent centuries with its qualification by Buddhists as a practice of compassion that increases the \u2018merits\u2019 (gongde) of those who release live animals (Handlin Smith 1999). In Hong Kong and Taiwan, Buddhist associations entered into discussion with birdwatching societies because many birds were found dead after they were bought in bird markets and released in surrounding natural parks. These associations had to warn through posters that releasing birds could cause the death of birds, because they were released in an improper environment, and the death of humans, since some of the birds found dead after the release carried avian flu (Severinghaus & Chi 1991).",

While the ritual introduced the bird into a cycle of life and death, the simulation used the decoy to produce signs of future threats for birds and humans. The black\u2010faced spoonbills were released in the Taijiang National Park with the hope that they would fly over to Hong Kong or the Fujian coast, where their signals could be captured. It should be noted that the Taiwan Straits are also the sites of military exercises or drills through which threats coming from China are mitigated. To prepare for an attack from the People's Republic of China, the Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control was organizing exercises simulating the use of bioweapons in a public space, such as SARS, smallpox, and avian flu virus (Rollet 2010: 311). The release of a black\u2010faced spoonbill in the same Chinese straits mimics and reverses the scenario of an avian flu outbreak from China. Instead of carrying information on the potential war between two long\u2010term enemies, it produces signals on the changes of bird habitats that concern birds as well as humans. While in the public health simulations birds are considered as carriers of infectious diseases, birdwatchers\u2019 simulations frame them as living beings with which humans share pathogens as signs of communication.",

According to PETA, more than a million pigeons are released every day from boats in the Taiwan Straits by pigeon\u2010racing clubs, and only 1 per cent survive to come back to their shelter. Huge amounts of money (an estimated US$2 billion) are spent in bets on those which will return, welcomed as heroes if they are first, killed if they are too slow.4 This is neither a ritual nor a simulation but a gambling practice through which birds crossing the sea between China and Taiwan are qualified as political signifiers. The reverse scenario of the game, producing strange identifications between humans and birds, tells the story of a pigeon successfully returning home while others fail and die in the Taiwan Straits.",

These three types of simulation displace the problem of sacrifice: that is, the definition of those who deserve to live and those who will die. Microbiological surveillance of viruses moves away from the site of emergence where birds are killed to prevent the spread of pathogens to humans, and traces continuities between humans and animals as a reservoir where viruses silently mutate. Simulations of epidemics don't address the problem of triage between humans in a situation of exception, but rather configure new relations between humans and animals through accessories in a performance. Exercises of vaccinating and releasing potentially sick birds don't raise the issue of how many birds can die for the sake of the species, but rather reflect on how to handle a bird with care in a political environment where they carry signals of threat. In the reverse scenarios of simulations, birds appear not as sources of infection that must be eradicated, but as sentinels with which humans can communicate to imagine potential futures.",

The use of computer software, accessories, and decoys in the three types of simulations I have analysed blurs the sharp opposition between humans and nonhumans. These objects can be considered as decoys because they carry the intentions that humans attribute to animals and shift their perception from inanimate objects to living beings. While scenarios of bird\u2010generated epidemics play on the asymmetries between humans and birds, the horizon of the simulation (the extinction of the human or of a bird species) integrates them as common actors of a game. Simulations can thus be considered as reflexive rituals because they display the uncertainties of the beings they play with and help to mitigate their threats. Framing simulation as an operation unfolding between the spheres of mimetic play and reflexive ritual, and at the same time performing a series of subject\u2010object reversals, I have argued for the need to approach this key apparatus of preparedness through a lens that allows for the mixing of pastoral and cynegetic techniques.",

The specificity of contemporary forms of anticipation through sentinels, simulation, or stockpiling is that the distinction between cynegetic techniques of preparedness, taking the perspectives of birds on future threats through imagination and communication, and pastoral techniques of prevention, protecting human or nonhuman populations from external dangers through risk calculation, has become more difficult to make and yet more urgent.
