McNeill argues, especially in his book Plagues and Peoples (1976) , that the spread of communicable diseases frequently has been an important influence in history. For example, there was a sharp population increase throughout the world in the eighteenth century; the population of China increased from 150 million in 1760 to 313 million in 1794, and the population of Europe increased from 118 million in 1700 to 187 million in 1800. There were many factors involved in this increase, including changes in marriage age and technological improvements leading to increased food supplies, but these factors are not sufficient to explain the increase. Demographic studies indicate that a satisfactory explanation requires recognition of a decrease in the mortality caused by periodic epidemic infections. This decrease came about partly through improvements in medicine, but a more important influence was probably the fact that more people developed immunities against infection as increased travel intensified the circulation and cocirculation of diseases.",

The Han Empire in China collapsed in the third century AD after a very similar sequence of events. The defeat of a population of millions of Aztecs by Cortez and his 600 followers can be explained, in part, by a smallpox epidemic that devastated the Aztecs but had almost no effect on the invading Spaniards, thanks to their built-in immunities. The Aztecs were not only weakened by disease but also confounded by what they interpreted as a divine force favoring the invaders. Smallpox then spread southward to the Incas in Peru and was an important factor in the success of Pizarro's invasion a few years later. smallpox was followed by other diseases such as measles and diphtheria imported from Europe to North America.

In fact, models often identify behaviors that are unclear in experimental data-often because data are nonreproducible and the number of data points is limited and subject to errors in measurement. For example, one of the fundamental results in mathematical epidemiology is that most mathematical epidemic models, including those that include a high degree of heterogeneity, usually exhibit \"threshold\" behavior, which in epidemiological terms can be stated as follows: If the average number of secondary infections caused by an average infective is less than one, a disease will die out, while if it exceeds one there will be an epidemic. This broad principle, consistent with observations and quantified via epidemiological models, has been used routinely to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination policies and the likelihood that a disease may be eliminated or eradicated. Hence, even if it is not possible to verify hypotheses accurately, agreement with hypotheses of a qualitative nature is often valuable. Expressions for the basic reproductive number for HIV in various populations is being used to test the possible effectiveness of vaccines that may provide temporary protection by reducing either HIV-infectiousness or susceptibility to HIV. Models are used to estimate how widespread a vaccination plan must be to prevent or reduce the spread of HIV.",

Detailed models are generally difficult or impossible to solve analytically and hence their usefulness for theoretical purposes is limited, although their strategic value may be high. For public health professionals, who are faced with the need to make recommendations for strategies to deal with a specific situation, simple models are inadequate and numerical simulation of detailed models is necessary. In this chapter, we concentrate on simple models in order to establish broad principles. Furthermore, these simple models have additional value since they are the building blocks of models that include detailed structure. A specific goal is to compare the dynamics of simple and slightly more detailed models primarily to see whether slightly different assumptions can lead to significant differences in qualitative behavior.",

The first known result in mathematical epidemiology is a defense of the practice of inoculation against smallpox in 1760 by over three generations) who had been trained as a physician. The first contributions to modern mathematical epidemiology are due to P.D. En'ko between 1873 and 1894 [Dietz (1988) ], and the foundations of the entire approach to epidemiology based on compartmental models were laid by public health physicians such as Sir R.A. Ross, W.H. Hamer, A.G. McKendrick, and W.O. Kermack between 1900 and 1935, along with important contributions from a statistical perspective by J. Brownlee. A particularly instructive example is the work of Ross on malaria. Dr. Ross was awarded the second Nobel Prize in Medicine for his demonstration of the dynamics of the transmission of malaria between mosquitoes and humans. Although his work received immediate acceptance in the medical community, his conclusion that malaria could be controlled by controlling mosquitoes was dismissed on the grounds that it would be impossible to rid a region of mosquitoes completely and that in any case, mosquitoes would soon reinvade the region. After Ross formulated a mathematical model that predicted that malaria outbreaks could be avoided if the mosquito population could be reduced below a critical threshold level, field trials supported his conclusions and led to sometimes brilliant successes in malaria control. Unfortunately, the Garki project provides a dramatic counterexample. This project worked to eradicate malaria from a region temporarily. However, people who have recovered from an attack of malaria have a temporary immunity against reinfection. Thus elimination of malaria from a region leaves the inhabitants of this region without immunity when the campaign ends, and the result can be a serious outbreak of malaria.",

One of the early triumphs of mathematical epidemiology was the formulation of a simple model by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) whose predictions are very similar to this behavior, observed in countless epidemics. The Kermack-McKendrick model is a compartmental model based on relatively simple assumptions on the rates of flow between different classes of members of the population. In order to model such an epidemic we divide the population being studied into three classes labeled S, I, and R. We let S(t) denote the number of individuals who are susceptible to the disease, that is, who are not (yet) infected at time t. I(t) denotes the number of infected individuals, assumed infectious and able to spread the disease by contact with susceptibles. R(t) denotes the number of individuals who have been infected and then removed from the possibility of being infected again or of spreading infection. Removal is carried out through isolation from the rest of the population, through immunization against infection, through recovery from the disease with full immunity against reinfection, or through death caused by the disease. These characterizations of removed members are different from an epidemiological perspective but are often equivalent from a modeling point of view that takes into account only the state of an individual with respect to the disease.",

In this situation, an infective makes \u03b2 N contacts in unit time, all of which are with susceptibles and thus produce new infections, and the mean infective period is 1/\u03b1; thus the basic reproduction number is actually \u03b2 N/\u03b1 rather than \u03b2 S 0 /\u03b1.

Detailed examination of the data indicates that there were actually two outbreaks, of which the first was relatively mild. Thus we shall try to fit the model (9.2) over the period from mid-May to mid-October 1666, measuring time in months with an initial population of 7 infectives and 254 susceptibles, and a final population of 83. Raggett (1982) gives values of susceptibles and infectives in Eyam on various dates, beginning with S(0) = 254, I(0) = 7, shown in Table 9 .1. The final size relation with S 0 = 254, I 0 = 7, S \u221e = 83 gives \u03b2 /\u03b1 = 6.54 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , \u03b1/\u03b2 = 153.

We use the values obtained here for the parameters \u03b2 and \u03c4 in the model (9.2) for simulations of both the phase plane, here the (S, I)-plane, and for graphs of S and I as functions of t (Figures 9.3 , 9.4, 9.5).

Our model assumes that infection is transmitted directly between people. While this is possible, bubonic plague is transmitted mainly by rat fleas. When an infected rat is bitten by a flea, the flea becomes extremely hungry and bites the host rat repeatedly, spreading the infection in the rat. When the host rat dies, its fleas move on to other rats, spreading the disease further. As the number of available rats decreases, the fleas move to human hosts, and this is how plague starts in a human population (although the second phase of the epidemic may have been the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, which can be spread from person to person). One of the main reasons for the spread of plague from Asia into Europe was the passage of many trading ships; in medieval times ships were invariably infested with rats. An accurate model of plague transmission would have to include flea and rat populations, as well as movement in space. Such a model would be extremely complicated, and its predictions might well not be any closer to observations than our simple unrealistic model. Very recent study of the data from Eyam suggests that the rat population may not have been large enough to support the epidemic and human to human transmission was also a factor. Raggett (1982) also used a stochastic model to fit the data, but the fit was rather poorer than the fit for the simple deterministic model(9.2).",

Further, the quarantine could do nothing to prevent the travel of rats and thus did little to prevent the spread of disease to other communities.

How many inhabitants would have to be immunized to avoid an epidemic? 8. Consider a disease with \u03b2 = 1/3000, 1/\u03b1 = 6 days in a population of 1200 members. Suppose the disease conferred immunity on recovered infectives. How many members would have to be immunized to avoid an epidemic? 9. A disease begins to spread in a population of 800. The infective period has an average duration of 14 days and the average infective is in contact with 0.1 persons per day. What is the basic reproductive number? To what level must the average rate of contact be reduced so that the disease will die out? 10. European fox rabies is estimated to have a transmission coefficient \u03b2 of 80 km 2 years/fox and an average infective period of 5 days. There is a critical carrying capacity K c measured in foxes per km 2 , such that in regions with fox density less than K c , rabies tends to die out, while in regions with fox density greater than K c , rabies tends to persist. Estimate K c . [Remark: It has been suggested in Great Britain that hunting to reduce the density of foxes below the critical carrying capacity would be a way to control the spread of rabies.] 11.

They allow the possibility that even if a disease outbreak has a reproduction number greater than 1, it may be only a minor outbreak and may not develop into a major epidemic.

Another approach would be to continue to use a network model throughout the course of the epidemic. In this section we shall indicate how a compartmental approach and a network approach are related.

It is more realistic to assume a contact rate that is a nonincreasing function of total population size. For example, a situation in which the number of contacts per infective in unit time is constant, called standard incidence, is a more accurate description for sexu-ally transmitted diseases. If there are no disease deaths, so that the total population size remains constant, such a distinction is unnecessary. We generalize the model (9.2) by dropping assumption (iv) and replacing assumption (i) by the assumption that an average member of the population makes C(N) contacts in unit time with C (N) \u2265 0 [Castillo-Chavez, Cooke, Huang, and Levin (1989a), Dietz (1982)], and we define",

Suppose F \u2265 0 and V is a nonsingular M-matrix. By Lemma 9.1, V \u22121 \u2265 0. Thus, (I \u2212 FV \u22121 ) has the Z sign pattern, and by Lemma 1, (I \u2212 FV \u22121 ) \u22121 \u2265 0 if and only if \u03c1(FV \u22121 ) < 1.
