Pain processing occurs independent of pathology (Peppin and Schatman, 2016); hence, in this review, we discuss pain as a general condition, rather than focusing on pain from specific diseases or injuries (e.g. musculoskeletal, cancer, migraine).",

Pain modulation may also be influenced by pro-inflammatory mediators, nerve growth factor, hormones (e.g. endorphins), and epigenetic modifications, and involves immune cells, mast cells, macrophages, and leukocytes (Guo et al., 2019). The activity of these cells is driven by several compounds, including short chain fatty acids and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Guo et al., 2019). An awareness of the nature of pain is important for contextualising and interpreting the potential role of pain-reducing interventions. However, a further discussion regarding pain mechanisms is beyond the scope of this paper; interested readers are instead referred to other reviews for further information (e.g. Bushnell et al. (2013), Hainline et al. (2017), Fregoso et al. (2019), and Guo et al. (2019).\n",

In the acute phase, strategies to prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain may also be implemented, targeting any of the risk factors (Table 2\n). These factors may continue to be targeted in chronic pain management, although treatments aimed at reducing hypersensitivity may be added. Finally, surgical options may be considered to address underlying problems (e.g. joint replacement, spinal fusion, nerve decompression), as well as strategies to reduce hypersensitivity. Chronic pain treatment is typically multidisciplinary and may be provided by a range of health professionals including physiotherapists, psychologists, occupational therapists, dentists, podiatrists, general practitioners, pain physicians, neurologists, anaesthetists, and appropriate surgeons (e.g. neurosurgeons, orthopaedic surgeons).",

This co-evolution underpins our argument that exposure to greenspace (with its microbiome) may positively influence pain outcomes. It has recently been demonstrated that direct soil contact changes the human skin microbiome (Gr\u00f6nroos et al., 2019), and that exposure to different environments (and their respective microbiomes) changes the human nasal and skin microbiome (Lai et al., 2017). Importantly, the latter study was conducted indoors and is therefore not susceptible to some of the potential confounding exposures present outdoors (e.g. direct plant/soil/animal interactions, exposure to sunlight and phytoncides) that may also influence the human microbiome (as discussed below). The influence of the environmental microbiome on the human gut microbiome is not currently well understood (Blum et al., 2019; Tasnim et al., 2017), however animal studies indicate such an influence (Blum et al., 2019), even via indirect exposure to soil via the aerobiome only (Liddicoat et al., 2020).",

Furthermore, there is emerging experimental evidence that changing the gut microbiome through probiotics (Lactobacillus casei Shirota (Lei et al., 2017), L. gasseri OLL2809 (Itoh et al., 2011), and combined L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum and L. gasseri (Khodaverdi et al., 2019) reduces pain in people with knee osteoarthritis (Lei et al., 2017), and endometriosis (Itoh et al., 2011; Khodaverdi et al., 2019). Recently, faecal microbiota transplants have also been shown to reduce pain in those with fibromyalgia (Thurm et al., 2017) and Clostridium difficile infection (Alukal et al., 2019). Although these positive results could be due either to changes in the disease state or to changes in pain processing, they nonetheless suggest that exposure to greenspace \u2013 and their associated environmental microbiomes \u2013 may lead to reductions in pain, via changes in the human microbiome.",

            "text": "As outlined above, the gut microbiome can influence the brain via various microbially-mediated mechanisms, and those related to chronic pain have recently been reviewed elsewhere (Guo et al., 2019). Microbiota-derived mediators may decrease pain perception via peripheral and central mechanisms. For peripheral mechanisms, the mediators that reduce hypersensitivity include proteases, kynurenic acid, and GABA (Guo et al., 2019). Short-chain fatty acids regulate leucocyte functions, and one of these short-chain fatty acids, butyrate, reduces pain associated with nerve injury by inhibiting histone deacetylase (Guo et al., 2019). Bile acids are another type of mediator, that may reduce pain by activating release of endogenous opioids from macrophages (Guo et al., 2019). The bacteria that could be implicated in the production of the abovementioned mediators include L. rhamnosus (Pokusaeva et al., 2017; Siragusa et al., 2007), L. brevis (Barrett et al., 2012), L. buchneri (Cho et al., 2007), L. paracasei (Komatsuzaki et al., 2005), L. plantarum (Siragusa et al., 2007), L. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus (Siragusa et al., 2007), Monascus purpureus (Su et al., 2003), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (Yang et al., 2008), Clostridium butyricum (Liu et al., 2015; Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), Coprococcus eutactus (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), C. comes (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), Bifidobacterium spp. (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), B. dentium (Barrett et al., 2012; Pokusaeva et al., 2017), B. infantis (Barrett et al., 2012), B. adolescentis (Barrett et al., 2012), Bacteroides fragilis (Strandwitz et al., 2019), Parabacteroides spp. (Strandwitz et al., 2019), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), Eubacterium hallii (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), E. rectale (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), Anaerostripes butyraticus (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), A. caccae (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), A. hadrus (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), Roseburia faecis (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), R. inulinivorans (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), R. intestinalis (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), R. hominis (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), and Escherichia spp. (Strandwitz et al., 2019) again supporting a potential association between gut microbiome and pain outcomes.",

Listening to pleasant nature sounds during elective Caesarean section has been shown to reduce post-operative pain severity (Farzaneh et al., 2019), and also resulted in lower pain for those undergoing mechanical ventilation (Saadatmand et al., 2015). Combined natural sounds and sights have resulted in lower pain severity compared with both city sounds and sights and with a control during bone marrow aspirate and biopsy (Lechtzin et al., 2010). Vincent et al. (2010) demonstrated differences in the effect of viewing an array of natural scenery on experimental pain sensation. They found that the combined prospect/refuge scenery resulted in lower pain sensation than prospect, refuge and hazard scenery and the control (a black screen). Listening to pleasant nature sounds has also been reported to improve sleep (Nasari et al., 2018), while a virtual nature experience reduced stress (Liszio et al., 2018), which may also lead to a reduction in pain. Greenspace exposure could therefore result in a reduction in pain due to exposure to natural sights and sounds.",

Different anxiety responses have been observed with exposure to different tree species in forest bathing (Guan et al., 2017), which could be explained by differences in the phytoncides released. A recent random crossover study (Horiuchi et al., 2014) compared two forest bathing exposures; one where participants could see the forest and the other where they could not. There was a significant reduction in trait-anxiety, depression, confusion and fatigue when the forest could be viewed, but not when the view was occluded, however there were no significant differences in the outcomes between the two exposures post-exposure (Horiuchi et al., 2014). Horiuchi et al.(2014) indicated that phytoncides are unlikely to be the sole reason for changes in human health outcomes related to greenspace exposure, but supported the notion that greenspace exposure may improve pain outcomes.",

However, there is some evidence of vitamin D lowering pain intensity for those with chronic widespread pain (Yong et al., 2017). The discrepancy between the observational and experimental evidence regarding the relationship vitamin D and pain may be the result of vitamin D acting as a proxy-measure of sunlight exposure. Sunlight exposure could lead to a change in pain through non-vitamin D pathways, including the release of beta-endorphins (Holick, 2016) and melatonin (Zhu et al., 2017), or indeed changes in the microbiome (Waterhouse et al., 2019). Furthermore, sunlight exposure (D\u00fczg\u00fcn and Durmaz Akyol, 2017) and vitamin D supplementation (Jamilian et al., 2019) have led to improved sleep including for people with chronic pain specifically (Huang et al., 2013). Vitamin D supplementation has also resulted in reduced inflammation (Jamilian et al., 2019) and improvements in depression (Jamilian et al., 2019), which may in turn contribute to improved pain outcomes.",

Physical activity is commonly prescribed by health professionals, particularly for patients in pain. Evidence in support of physical activity for reducing the prevalence and impact of pain include findings of physical activity being associated with a lower incidence of neck pain (Kim et al., 2018b), and lower prevalence of lower back pain (Alzahrani et al., 2019b), including frequent and chronic lower back pain (Shiri and Falah-Hassani, 2017). Furthermore, interventions to increase incidental physical activity lead to improved lower back pain-related disability (Alzahrani et al., 2019a). For those with musculoskeletal conditions in particular, physical activity may decrease nociception by improving the underlying musculoskeletal condition. Exercise reduces inflammation (Stigger et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019) and stress (Bischoff et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Ayllon et al., 2019), improves sleep (Banno et al., 2018; Kreutz et al., 2019; Lederman et al., 2019; Lowe et al., 2019; Stutz et al., 2019) and mental health (B\u00e9land et al., 2019; McDowell et al., 2019; Morres et al., 2019; Nakamura et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Ayllon et al., 2019), and changes the human microbiome (Mailing et al., 2019). The health improvements associated with exercise may also influence pain perception and the risk of transitioning from acute to chronic pain. Thus, physical activity, particularly when facilitated by greenspace exposure, is likely to also contribute to a reduction in the global burden of pain.",

Social support has been associated with pain perception (Che et al., 2018b), including experimental pain (Che et al., 2018a), while low levels of social support are associated with a higher risk of transitioning from acute to chronic pain (Fregoso et al., 2019). In addition, higher levels of social support and integration are associated with lower inflammation (Uchino et al., 2018), better sleep (Kent de Grey et al., 2018), and better mental health (Tengku Moud et al., 2019) which may all in turn influence pain perception. Of note, sleep may also influence the gut microbiome (Benedict et al., 2016; Poroyko et al., 2016) and thus potentially pain perception through that mechanism as well. We therefore suggest that greenspace exposure is likely to decrease both pain perception, and the transition from acute to chronic pain, via improvements in social integration and support.",

            "text": "One of the advantages of greenspace exposure as an intervention for pain, particularly chronic pain, is that it is not reliant on medical intervention, and could be implemented while on waiting lists for specialist appointments \u2013 a particularly important consideration in the socially isolating conditions of a pandemic, with elective surgery and pain clinics closed down. It can take years for patients to gain access to these services (Anderson, 2016), during which time their nervous systems change and the burden of their pain increases. The caveat to this is, however, that appropriate greenspaces must be accessible to those who require them. Several general barriers to such greenspace access have been suggested, and include a lack of amenities (Cronin-de-Chavez et al., 2019; Sefcik et al., 2019), safety concerns (Boyd et al., 2018; Cronin-de-Chavez et al., 2019; Sefcik et al., 2019; Selby et al., 2019), proximity to greenspace (Selby et al., 2019), and issues with transport (Boyd et al., 2018; Cronin-de-Chavez et al., 2019; Fretwell and Greig, 2019; Sefcik et al., 2019). Perhaps more importantly, a lack of interest (Boyd et al., 2018; Fretwell and Greig, 2019) and time (Boyd et al., 2018; Fretwell and Greig, 2019; Holt et al., 2019; Selby et al., 2019), and debilitating health conditions (Boyd et al., 2018; Cronin-de-Chavez et al., 2019; Fretwell and Greig, 2019; Sefcik et al., 2019) have also been identified as barriers. Finally, in the current COVID-19 situation, strict lockdowns in countries like Italy are likely to reduce greenspace exposure for many people. These barriers support the need to optimise opportunistic encounters with greenspace, such as advice to optimise private greenspaces to maximize benefits, as well as utilising verges and high-use areas (e.g. commuter paths, work place environments) for optimal greenspace, so that passive exposure to the aerobiome is achieved. Stakeholder engagement is also essential to improve usage of public greenspaces (Roberts et al., 2016).",
