Effective treatment, however, was not possible at that time; prevention and spread of infectious diseases depended solely on proper hygienic means.At the beginning of the 20th century, passive and active vaccination procedures were developed against a number of these pathogenic micro-organisms in order to prevent the diseases in question (rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, etc.) and due to the discovery of antimicrobial chemicals (Ehrlich) and antibiotics (Fleming), the threat of infectious diseases seemed to be minimized. Largescale vaccination programs against childhood diseases (diphtheria, whooping cough and polio) started in the early fifties, giving hope to finally eradicate these diseases from the planet. This approach was successful for smallpox (1980) ; however, new infectious diseases emerged (e.g., Legionella, HIV, Helicobacter, SARS, etc.). New vaccines and antibiotics are needed. Furthermore, due to the intensive medical treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs,hospital infections are a growing problem. Bacteria hitherto deemed harmless are causing opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients.The pathogens develop multiple resistances to antibiotics and sometimes no effective antibiotics are available to treat those patients.",

Second, when the host is challenged with endotoxin, soluble factors are produced by MACROPHAGES that mediate fever and an acutephase response. These factors include the proinflammatory CYTOKINES, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. Together, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 stimulate endothelial cells to produce and express proteins on their membrane that have adhesive properties for leukocytes, promoting the migration and passage of POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKO-CYTES (PMNs) from blood vessels through the endothelial layer, leading to PMN influx into the tissue. Adhesion molecules that mediate the binding of PMNs appear on the endothelium after an inflammatory stimulus, followed by molecules that are specific for adhesion of MONOCYTES or LYMPHOCYTES, which may be why neutrophils enter before mononuclear cells.

Cell-wall components, such as peptidoglycan and teichoic acid, are clearly important in the activation of these cells.

CD14 is a cell surface glycoprotein that functions as a binding receptor for LPS.However its membrane anchoring by a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) linkage suggests little signaling and suggests the existence of additional coreceptors. Recent studies indicate that innate immune cells recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including LPS, through TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS (TLRs) (Fig. 4) . This family of proteins, that resemble the antimicrobial Toll proteins of Drosophila, has been identified in humans and mice. TLR4 was identified as the missing link in LPS-induced cell signal transduction and responsiveness that is associated with MD-2 and CD14. The TLR family members are coupled to a signaling adapter protein (MyD88) and form differential dimers that may explain the discrete responses to TLR ligands such as lipoprotens, heat shock proteins, unmethylated CpG DNA, viral dsRNA and bacterial flagellin. Intracellular signaling involves several kinases depending on the TLRs involved and includes the MAP kinase and NF-\u03baB pathways leading to a cellular response. Recently other protein families have been identified via genetic screening that also participate in direct recognition of pathogens. A new protein was found to be involved in resistance to Gram-positive bacterial infections and recognizes the cell wall component peptidoglycan.",

In contrast, HIV-1 infection of MACRO-PHAGES is self-sustained and results in an inexorable growth of chronic active inflammatory processes in 112 Immune response in human pathology: infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites ",

Infected cells bear the fusion protein gp41 and may therefore fuse with other infected cells.This helps the virus to spread and accounts for the multinucleated cells seen in lymph nodes and brain. As a result of the decreased numbers of CD4positive T-helper cells and defects in antigen presentation, depressed immune responses in these patients are observed. During the progression of the disease, opportunistic infections by otherwise harmless micro-organisms can occur. These include Candida albicans oesophagitis, mucocutaneous herpes simplex, toxoplasma in the central nervous system, and pneumonia caused by toxoplasma and Pneumocystis carinii; Kaposi's sarcoma also occurs frequently in these patients.This has been linked to the presence of a previously unknown type of Herpes virus (HHV-8).This immune deficiency syndrome is called 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' (AIDS). It has been suggested that infected MONOCYTES/MACRO-PHAGES carry the HIV virus into the brain where it replicates in microglia and infiltrating MACROPHAGES. As a consequence many AIDS patients develop cognitive and motor brain impairments. However, the picture is complicated by the various persistent infections already present in these patients, which give rise to their own pathology in the brain. These include Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus neoformans and JC virus.",

Treatment of infected individuals is possible but expensive. At this moment a triple therapy is being prescribed in the Western countries (two reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one protease inhibitor, Fig. 5 ), each of which interfere with specific steps in the process of HIV replication. One major problem that has arisen is the increasing resistance to these drugs. Blocking of the chemokine receptor 5, a recently described co-receptor on CD4 cells for HIV, may be an alternative treatment for infected persons. This notion is supported by a recent finding that a homozygous defect in this chemokine receptor accounts for resistance of multiple-exposed individuals to HIV-1 infection. preparing his vaccines, Koch employed killed germs (cholera) as a vaccine. Since diphtheria and tetanus cause disease by means of toxins, the next logical step in the development of vaccines was the use of detoxified toxins to induce protection against these diseases (diphtheria, Von Behring and tetanus, Kitasato).Von Behring and Kitasato were the first to demonstrate that the source of the protective activity induced by vaccines was present in blood serum. Von Behring was also the first to prove that protective immunity could be passed on via serum. The development of new vaccines had its ups (yellow fever) and downs (tuberculosis). With the arrival of antibiotics, all work on new bacterial vaccines was suspended or severely curtailed, although some researchers continued to work on viral vaccines, such as rubella, measles, polio, and mumps.",

Today, thanks to new insights into the immune system and modern molecular biological and chemical techniques of analysis and synthesis, it is possible to produce well-defined vaccines.These contain only those determinants of the pathogenic microorganism which induce protection (epitopes). These epitopes are usually short peptide or oligosaccharide chains, which can be produced synthetically or by means of recombinant DNA techniques. The immunogenicity of these products can be enhanced by coupling them to a carrier (tetanus toxoid, liposomes) and/or by adding an adjuvant (a substance which strengthens the immune response non-specifically). The recombinant DNA technique can also be used to obtain attenuated strains of micro-organisms, which are fully immunogenic and thus provide protection,but which are no longer virulent. One example of this is the development of a new cholera vaccine based on a bacterium which has all the characteristics of a virulent strain,except the toxin.The bacterium has retained all its adherence factors, which allow it to adhere to the intestinal mucosa; the length of time it spends in the intestine is sufficient to stimulate the local immune system.The newest trend in vaccinology is immunization by introducing plasmid DNA into the host.Success has been attained by this method for hepatitis B vaccination.",

The next goal of the WHO is to eradicate the poliovirus in the coming years. Major problems to be dealt with are the distribution of these vaccines, the costs involved, the registration and the compliance of the vaccinees and molecular techniques to trace the final bug. Meanwhile new unexpected microbiological threats come into focus. Hospital infections caused by multiple resistant micro-organisms due to the abundant use of antibiotics and exchange of genetic material between micro-organisms impose major problems on patients and healthcare workers. New antibiotics and/or vaccines should be developed and new strategies employed to contain these infections. Due to crowding and high mobility of the world population, old and new pathogens, e.g., influenza and SARS, threaten our society. On top of this terrorists might intentionally use micro-organisms (Smallpox, Anthrax, Plague etc.), or bacterial toxins (Botulism) to cause death and disease in humans or animals in a civilian setting.The recognition that an event was caused by a biological weapon presents a severe challenge to be prepared for such an attack, especially for medical care providers and public health officials. Strategies to combat bioterrorism have to be worked out but with the experience of 100 years of combating microorganisms with hygiene measures, vaccination, antibiotic and anti-viral treatment, there must be a way out.",
