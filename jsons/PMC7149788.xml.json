However, their utility needs to be considered in the context that (1) Direct visualisation or culture is not always feasible. (2) These techniques can be time consuming and technically difficult. (3) Phenotypic variation can occur during a pathogen's life cycle; e.g., eggs, larvae and adult forms of a species may alter depending on the stage of development, the associated host or vector and whether the organism is free-living. Thus, antibodies or isoenzyme techniques for detection may become limiting and dependent on the stages in the life cycle. (4) Host immune responses can be delayed, or conversely, they remain persistent even after resolution of a previous infection. (5) Cross-reacting antibodies acquired from natural infections or vaccination can produce false positive results.",

            "text": "Many of the traditional diagnostic tests are now being complemented or replaced by genotypic analysis, i.e., detection of DNA or RNA fragment sizes or specific sequences through nucleic acid hybridisation techniques, or increasingly today DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An expression frequently found in microbiologic DNA testing is NAT (nucleic acid amplification technique). NAT refers to a number of techniques apart from PCR that can be used to amplify DNA, e.g., ligase chain reaction. For convenience, the description \u201cPCR\u201d will be used interchangeably with \u201cNAT\u201d to indicate broadly based amplification of DNA. To synthesise or design a DNA probe or primer, it is necessary to sequence an organism's DNA to identify species-specific regions (see Table A.2, which provides more information about probes and primers). Today, whole genomes from many pathogens have been sequenced, and this information is available on databases. From this sequence (1) DNA primers can be synthesised for PCR. (2) DNA probes can be isolated or synthesised (oligonucleotide probes) for nucleic acid hybridisation techniques.Ribotyping: A useful target for a probe is repetitive DNA, an example of which is ribosomal RNA (rRNA). rRNA and the rRNA genes in chromosomal DNA provide naturally derived amplified products that enhance their hybridisation potential. In these circumstances, radiolabelled DNA probes can be avoided since the signal-to-noise ratio is increased because of the amplified target sequence (Figure 8.1\n). This method of differentiating between bacteria is called ribotyping. For ribotyping, DNA is broken into fragments using restriction endonucleases. DNA probes that are specific for rRNA genes, then allow various fragments to be identified and compared. This approach is very similar to DNA mapping or Southern blotting in eukaryotic DNA (see the Appendix), and the bacterial hybridisation patterns are comparable to eukaryote DNA polymorphisms.Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE): This type of DNA electrophoresis is capable of separating very large DNA fragments. These fragments result from digesting the organism's genome with a restriction endonuclease enzyme such as NotI that cuts DNA very infrequently (see Table A.1). The pattern of the fragments generated in this way is sufficiently discriminatory to allow bacterial strains to be distinguished. Read more about PFGE under Legionella.DNA hybridisation: 16SrRNA and 12SrRNA contain highly conserved regions common to all bacteria as well as highly variable regions unique to particular species. Therefore, multifunctional DNA or RNA probes can be prepared since they can be generic for all bacteria, or specific for different species or strains.",

Thus, there are genus-specific and species-specific PCR-based assays and many other strategies appropriate for a range of activities involving microorganisms in the environment, food industry, research and clinical practice. Ultimately, the most information that can be obtained about a microorganism's DNA is through sequencing of its genome. This is now increasingly possible as a consequence of the Human Genome Project and the sequencing of many model organisms (see Table 8.2\n). The spread of epidemics or hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections will be followed and characterised with more accuracy by the identification of unique DNA fingerprints for individual pathogens. The value of the DNA approach to emergent infections was recently illustrated by SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2014discussed in more detail below).",

The negative predictive value (NPV) refers to the percentage of all negative test results that are truly negative (or the probability that the disease is absent when the test is negative). NPV is influenced by test sensitivity as well as prevalence. A high NPV will be easier to obtain if the infection has a low prevalence in a population. Tests with high PPVs are required for conditions in which a false diagnosis will have significant consequences; e.g., treatment regimens are potentially toxic; there are medical or psychological stigmata associated with a positive test as might occur in the case of sexually transmitted diseases.

            "text": "In contrast to the genetics DNA laboratory, the microbiology DNA laboratory faces greater technical challenges because infected samples invariably have little of the pathogen's DNA to function as a template for PCR, and the limited amount of DNA that is available will be mixed with DNA from many other organisms that are present. Because of the small target for PCR, it is not surprising that contamination from other PCR products (other samples or previous amplifications) becomes a major source of error. Another inherent problem in the microbiology setting is the potential for inhibitors in the various samples tested to interfere with DNA amplification. Finally, interpretation of some microbiological DNA results is difficult because the test shows only the presence of pathogen DNA. Whether this indicates active infection or residual DNA after the pathogen has died cannot be determined. On the other hand, the finding of mRNA (i.e., cDNA by PCR) is more likely to indicate an active infection. If one then adds that DNA tests are relatively expensive compared to the traditional approaches, it is not surprising that many of the optimistic predictions about molecular microbiology have been slow to materialise. However, there is a steadily growing acceptance of DNA diagnostics. The threat of bioterror or emerging global infections such as was feared with SARS will best be resolved if there is a DNA or RNA component as part of the overall containment strategy.",

On the other hand, false negative results can reflect the presence of inhibitors in the specimen being tested or chemical substances such as anticoagulants. Another source of a false negative result with HIV occurs because of the considerable diversity found in the viral DNA sequence so that a mismatch between the usual primer pairs inhibits the subsequent PCR step. This difficulty can be avoided by use of primer pair combinations derived from conserved segments of the viral genome.

However, the first-generation immunoassays gave rise to many false positives. This problem with serological testing was overcome by the availability of more sophisticated second- and third-generation enzyme immunoassays. Similar to what happens with HIV, the resolution of false positive results is undertaken by an additional assay such as an immunoblot that incorporates multiple viral-specific antigens.

A resurgence in malaria reflects socioeconomic factors (poverty, overcrowding), emergence of mosquitoes that are resistant to insecticides and development of drug resistance. The two common forms of malaria (P. falciparum and P. vivax) produce severe anaemia, and in addition, P. falciparum is associated with cerebral malaria, respiratory and metabolic complications. This differing spectrum is partly explained by P. falciparum being able to invade a large proportion of red blood cells compared to P. vivax, which invades only the reticulocytes. Another explanation is the mode of entry of these parasites into red blood cells, with P. falciparum having a number of different invasion pathways compared to P. vivax, which is able to enter only red blood cells that carry the Duffy blood group.",

Why some go on to develop a chronic carrier state is not known, with the course of the illness after infection very variable. This has been explained on the basis that it involves the viral genotype and the host's immune responses; i.e., following acute infection, a vigorous T cell response against the various viral-specific components (core, envelope and polymerase) limits the infection. In contrast, those with a poor cellular immune response are more likely to develop a chronic carrier state. In this scenario, the MHC will play a key role since class II molecules from the HLA complex are critical for T cells to function. Evidence for an MHC-related effect in hepatitis B infection is presented in Table 8.8.",

In developing countries, primary EBV infection is asymptomatic and occurs early in life. In developed countries, the primary infection is delayed until adolescence or adult life, when it manifests as infectious mononucleosis. An in vitro characteristic of EBV is its ability to immortalise lymphocytes, an application that is very useful in the research laboratory to provide a permanent supply of a particular cell line (or an unlimited source of DNA). In the immortalised lymphocyte, EBV does not replicate but remains as multiple extrachromosomal copies of the circular viral DNA genome in the cell. Latent infection with EBV is accompanied by the expression of a set of viral latent genes. These genes and their respective proteins are well characterised and include (1) six nuclear antigens: EBNAs 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C and LP; (2) three latent membrane proteins: LMPs 1, 2A and 2B and (3) EBERs 1, 2\u2014small, non-polyadenylated non-coding RNAs.",

Two important ones (these are always present in the laboratory-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines) are EBNA2 and LMP1. The former is a transcriptional regulator; hence, inappropriate expression of this gene will have far-reaching effects on cell proliferation. LMP1 in experimental studies behaves as an oncogene. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a tumour that is predominantly found in China and South East Asia. The latency genes EBNA1, EBERs and LMP1 are frequently found in this tumour. A recent study used Q-PCR to quantitate EBV-specific DNA (in the form of EBNA3 and LMP1) in the plasma and tumours from nearly 100 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This study showed that the amount of EBV DNA in the plasma correlated closely with the stage of the cancer with the most DNA found in tumours that had metastasised. The authors (Lin et al 2004) suggested that monitoring for EBV DNA in the plasma was an effective way to predict outcome to treatment.",

These mutations are occurring continuously over a period of time. The new strains produced are antigenic variants that nevertheless remain related to viruses from preceding epidemics. Thus, they can avoid immune surveillance in those who have developed immunity, and so outbreaks occur. Because some immunity is still present, only epidemics result. (2) Genetic (antigenic) shift\u2014this results from an abrupt major change in antigenicity of the HA protein or the HA and NA protein combination. Either this is the result of a novel HA alone, or in combination with a novel NA. This virus is antigenically distinct from previous ones and has not arisen from them by mutation. It is likely that the sources of the new viral gene are water birds that have a large reservoir of different HA and NA genes. They then get into humans via other animals such as pigs or directly from chickens such as occurred with the H5N1 virus discussed below.

Fortunately, the culling of more than a million chickens controlled this particular outbreak. Since then, there have been other human cases, with the most recent reported in Vietnam and Thailand.

The \u201cSpanish\u201d (H1N1) flu epidemic in 1918 killed over 20 million people.

However, swapping of genetic material should an individual be co-infected with both might produce a hybrid H5 (avian flu) N2 (human flu) virus with devastating effects. Another way for this mixing to occur (called reassortment) would involve an animal such as a pig being simultaneously infected with both the human influenza virus and the bird flu virus. This mixing might produce a new virulent virus if it had human genes (allowing human-to-human spread) and lethal genes from the bird virus. DNA sequencing of the viral genome from various outbreaks has shown: (1) Viruses from 1997 and 2003 Hong Kong infections have mutated; i.e., their DNA sequences are different.

The horse strain (G4) is not infective to humans. Another strain (G8) is associated with E. granulosus infections in Alaska and was not considered to be highly pathogenic until DNA analysis of a severely affected individual showed that this was not the case (Box 8.2\n).Box 8.2Hydatid disease in Alaska (McManus et al 2002).Hydatid disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus has two different forms in North America: (1) Domestic (pastoral)\u2014 dogs are definitive hosts, and typical intermediate hosts are sheep. Humans get infected through exposure to E. granulosus eggs shed by the dogs. (2) Sylvatic\u2014this is found in higher latitudes, and the corresponding hosts are wolves or sled dogs and moose or reindeer. Based on experience of hydatid disease in Alaska, treatment of the sylvatic form is usually conservative rather than surgery since the natural history of hydatid disease in the higher latitudes is fairly benign. Therefore, it was surprising when two patients developed a severe form of hydatid disease in Alaska. One explanation for this different clinical profile was infection from some other geographic region (both had visited the lower United States). However, in one patient, DNA analysis of the E. granulosus showed that it was the G8 genotype, i.e., what would normally be found in Alaska. This was confirmed by showing that a number of infected moose carried the identical strain. The case provides further understanding of the G8 variant of E. granulosus, which normally follows a relatively benign natural history, but in some unusual cases (for reasons as yet unknown) it can produce severe disease. Until DNA analysis became available, this level of understanding of hydatid disease would not have been possible.",

Serological testing is the mainstay of diagnosis although a number of DNA-derived tests are now being developed. These tests can utilise DNA hybridisation with probes that are often rRNA-specific. Another useful rDNA approach to fingerprinting bacterial genomes such as Legionella spp. is pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The technique allows large segments of DNA to be separated by using restriction enzymes such as NotI and SfiI that digest DNA very infrequently. The upper limit for resolution in conventional DNA gel electrophoresis is approximately 30 kb, whereas for pulsed field gel electrophoresis it is approaching 10 Mb (10 \u00d7 103 kb). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis has been particularly attractive in microbiological work because the genomes of infectious agents are relatively small. For example, total DNA from Legionella spp. can be cleaved into a limited number of fragments (5\u201310 with NotI, depending on the strain), and these fragments or fingerprints can be directly visualised from an ethidium bromide stained gel, thereby avoiding the requirement for a DNA probe and a hybridisation step.

Changes in global climate may also contribute directly, through their effects on vegetation, insect and rodent populations.",

There is also an increasing awareness that a number of pathogens could be used for bioterrorism. Some of the zoonoses associated with a viral haemorrhagic clinical picture can be confused with other clinical infections including malaria, leptospirosis and Neisseria meningitidis, and in these potentially fatal conditions, a rapid screening test is essential. In terms of bioterrorism and the differential diagnosis of haemorrhagic fevers, PCR (NAT) based assays are presently the only options with the potential to allow rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests to be developed.",

Nevertheless, the molecular approach enabled the following key information to be obtained in a very short time frame:\u2022Molecular typing of this virus from an outbreak in Taiwan confirmed that the virus was identical in its DNA sequence to a virus isolated from a Hong Kong outbreak; i.e., human-to-human spread had occurred through an individual who had been in Hong Kong. Similar comparisons were possible, linking various outbreaks through molecular epidemiology.\u2022Rapid whole genome sequencing of the viral RNA provided a firm base for the development of PCR-based diagnostic assays, a critical requirement for acute infections such as SARS-CoV.\u2022In searching for animal reservoirs, RT-PCR\u2013based techniques were used. They enabled the SARS-CoV to be detected, as well as identified genetic differences between the human and animal virus.\u2022Future understanding of the virus, how it evolved, what strains were pathogenic and its mode of spread to populations could be addressed through DNA approaches. For this, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases released a genome chip containing the full 29 700 base pairs of the SARS viral genome.The SARS outbreak ended just as quickly as it started. Only the occasional cases were reported in early 2004, and none was reported after the end of April that year. However, there remain many unanswered questions, including the inconsistent human-to-human transmission with documented cases of one infected passenger transmitting to a number of others on a particular flight, while on another flight no transmission occurred despite a number of passengers being ill with this virus. These inconsistencies were explained by proposing that some of those infected were \u201csuper-spreaders.\u201d Another intriguing observation with SARS is the relatively large numbers of health workers that have been infected; i.e., SARS transmission seems to be more likely within a hospital setting.",

The WHO has also flagged the importance of laboratory containment when dealing with this virus. This became an issue when two of the nine persons infected in China in 2004 worked in a reference laboratory conducting research into SARS-CoV. A similar scenario was reported earlier from Singapore.

DNA-based genotyping has already proven its value in the case of the 2001 US anthrax cases (Box 8.3\n). Promising reports now suggest that a pathogen such as anthrax could be detected within an hour by real-time PCR. Smallpox is another serious infection since routine vaccination was stopped in the USA in the early 1970s, leaving many unvaccinated and so vulnerable targets in this and other countries. In Asia, case fatality rates of around 30% were observed during epidemics, and there are no known treatments for smallpox. As part of its biologic warfare program, the former Soviet Union produced smallpox, anthrax and other pathogens, and it remains a concern that some could fall into the hands of potential terrorists.Box 8.3Bioterrorism using anthrax (Griffith et al2003).Anthrax is caused by B. anthracis, a gram positive spore-forming organism. It is usually acquired by humans through exposure to infected animal products or contaminated dust. The major forms of anthrax are cutaneous (95% of cases, with a mortality of about 20%) and pulmonary (100% mortality if not treated before symptoms develop). In October and November following the September 11, 2001, World Trade Centre disaster, 7 cutaneous and 11 inhalational cases of anthrax occurred in Florida, New York City, New Jersey, Washington DC and Connecticut. They were examples of bioterrorism since all bacteria came from the one source based on DNA typing, which showed an identical genotype. The likely route of infection was intentionally contaminated mail. Apart from two cases, all others were mail or government workers, or employees at news media outlets. The two exceptions were a 61-year-old woman in New York City and a 94-year-old woman in Connecticut. Both died after developing inhalational anthrax. It was possible to detect a likely source of infection in the case of the Connecticut victim. The postal processing and distribution centre (PDCs) for the letter-related cases had been identified through the finding of contaminating bacteria. However, for this victim, no samples from her home or personal items tested positive for B. anthracis. It was known that she had received mail (including junk or bulk mail) from one of these PDCs. It was also subsequently shown that her local PDC (Southern Connecticut) had a heavily contaminated sorting machine. From this, it was assumed that B. anthracis identical to those involved in the other outbreaks had infected her through a letter directly contaminated in a PDC implicated in the earlier infections, or secondarily contaminated in the Southern Connecticut PDC.",

Although it does not have the same emotive force as HIV, it is an important modern scourge that will need to have its spread controlled more effectively, and those infected will need access to antiviral agents (Box 8.4\n).Box 8.4Hepatitis C virus (HCV).Thirteen years after the term \u201cnon-A, non-B\u201d hepatitis was first used, the HCV virus was found. A milestone in molecular virology came when HCV was cloned in 1988, years before it was visualised, cultured or even characterised. Based on its amino acid sequence and genomic organisation, HCV was classed in a separate genus in the viral family Flaviviridae. HCV is an RNA virus and has six genotypes (1\u20136). The main source of infection today is intravenous drug use. Transfusion-related HCV is rarely seen because of the effective screening methods in place. Unlike HBV, mother-to-infant and sexual transmission is rare. Nearly 170 million people worldwide are infected with HCV, which is now the most common reason for liver transplantation in the USA. Unlike HBV, which infrequently leads to chronic hepatitis, about 70% of those infected with HCV develop this complication. Like HBV, the hepatic damage caused by HCV is thought to be secondary to an immune response rather than a direct viral effect. In addition, age, male sex, alcohol consumption, coexistent HIV infection, low CD4+ count and metabolic disorders such as diabetes predispose to the development of liver cirrhosis and subsequently hepatocellular cancer. Like HIV, excellent serologic or DNA-based assays are available for accurate diagnosis. Quantitative RNA assays and genotyping enable predictions to be made of how an individual will respond to antiviral therapy. Treatments using interferon alpha and ribavirin are effective, particularly with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 (88% response rates compared to 48% for the other four genotypes). However, because of inadequate detection (or the money to pay for the above drugs), there is considerable concern that what is being seen at present is only the tip of the iceberg since the virus has a long incubation period, and many who are carriers remain asymptomatic until complications develop.",

            "text": "Fig. 8.8: BSE, CJD and vCJD. BSE (mad cow disease) is caused by a prion, i.e., abnormal form of a protein (PrP) that can spread from one organism to another and interfere with the shape of the normal protein. The gene producing the PrP protein is called PRNP, and the two forms are PrPc (normal protein; the c = cellular) and PrPSc (abnormal protein; the Sc = scrapie). In the UK, BSE resulted from the feeding of contaminated food to cattle. A similar disease is found in sheep and goats (called scrapie). In humans, the same disease is called CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). There are a number of forms of CJD. The sporadic type is rare and occurs in the elderly. The inherited form is also rare, and it can be shown to have mutations in the PRNP gene. Iatrogenic CJD occurs from contaminated instruments or human products. Because the prion is not a traditional pathogen, sterilisation methods are not effective. Variant CJD (vCJD) is the result of direct animal-to-human spread (through contaminated beef products). vCJD has not been transmitted by blood, but because of the long incubation period possible (perhaps 30 or more years), this cannot be excluded, and some disturbing experimental data suggest that this is possible.",
