The temporal and cellular patterns of NEP expression implicate the enzyme in the regulation of BLP\u2010mediated fetal lung development. Indeed, both in vitro and in vivo, it was shown that inhibition of NEP resulted in increased maturation of the developing fetal lung [\n10]. Reduced NEP activity may also promote BLP\u2010mediated proliferation of bronchial epithelial cells. Indeed, the growth and proliferation of BLP\u2010dependent carcinomas is inhibited by NEP and potentiated by NEP inhibition [\n9]. NEP expression by epithelial cells is inversely correlated with cellular proliferation. Therefore, reduced NEP activity may promote BLP\u2010mediated proliferation and facilitate the development of small\u2010cell carcinomas of the lung [\n9]. A role for NEP in the regulation of tumour cell proliferation is also supported by studies using a human T\u2010cell line (Jurkat).

In the human bronchus, DPP IV is strongly present in serosal submucosal glands [\n7]. The expression of DPP IV on haematopoietic cells is regulated stringently. DPP IV is absent from the majority of human resting peripheral blood T lymphocytes, but some subsets of resting peripheral blood T cells weakly express the molecule. DPP IV expression on T lymphocytes is increased after T\u2010cell activation. Thus, DPP IV is a suitable marker for T cells activated in vivo. Recent data indicate that DPP IV expression on T cells may correlate with T\u2010helper (TH) subsets [\n19]. High DPP IV expression was found on TH1 and TH0 cells, whereas TH2 cells displayed lower expression of DPP IV. The amount of IL\u20104 secretion was responsible for this correlation [\n19].

Stimulation of DPP IV (using monoclonal antibodies) leads to the activation of all functional programs of the T cells, including cytotoxicity and production of IL\u20102. This activation requires the expression of the TCR and DPP IV enzymatic activity. Furthermore, antibody\u2010induced cross\u2010linking of DPP IV\u2010induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins with a similar pattern to that seen after TCR/CD3 stimulation [\n20]. Co\u2010cross\u2010linking of DPP IV and CD3 antigens induced prolonged and increased tyrosine phosphorylation in comparison with CD3 alone, indicating that DPP IV is a true costimulatory entity [\n20].

One possible mechanism for the enhanced response of T cells to perturbation of DPP IV was suggested by the demonstration that CD45, a tyrosine phosphatase that positively regulates TCR signalling, coprecipitates with DPP IV [\n21].

Both forms are transcribed from a single gene by the use of two separate functional promoters, a somatic and a testicular form. The somatic form is composed of two highly homologous domains, probably arising by gene duplication in the course of evolution. The germinal isoform only contains one of the two homologous domains. Somatic ACE comprises 1306 amino acids with 17 potential N\u2010linked glycosylation sites. Each domain has a catalytic site, containing zinc, which functions independently.",

The enzyme preferentially cleaves peptides containing an aromatic residue in the P1 position (\nTable 1), but the enzyme is far less selective than NEP. It is capable of inactivating bradykinin and enkephalins, and hydrolyses angiotensin I to yield the vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin II.

Bradykinin, which is present in the asthmatic airways and is released after relevant aeroallergen challenge in allergic individuals, can stimulate sensory nerves to induce retrograde release of tachykinins. Increased levels of (neuro)peptides in the airways of asthmatic patients may contribute both to acute and chronic inflammatory abnormalities. In addition to their acute effects, such as the constriction of airway smooth muscle, the secretion of mucus, and vasodilation [\n34], several studies have shown that (neuro)peptides possess a wide number of immunomodulatory effects and may be involved in tissue repair responses [\n50]. Interestingly, several types of leucocytes, including eosinophils and macrophages, are able to produce and release SP themselves, further supporting a role for these molecules in immunological reactions.

This may suggest that endogenously released neuropeptides do not play a role in antigen\u2010induced airway responses. Alternatively, antigen challenge may result in a dysfunction of NEP activity. To further determine whether peptidases and neuropeptides contribute to asthma, in vivo studies using selective neurokinin receptor antagonists should be performed both in the presence and absence of NEP or other peptidase inhibitors. Neurokinin receptor antagonists should first be tested against tachykinin\u2010induced bronchoconstriction in order to determine the optimal dose of the antagonists. Second, the effects of these antagonists should be analysed in allergen\u2010induced bronchoconstriction, both in the absence and in the presence of peptidase inhibitors. Furthermore, it would be interesting to treat allergic asthmatics with appropriate neurokinin receptor antagonists (either intravascular or by inhalation) for a longer period of time, and to determine whether this affects allergen\u2010induced bronchoconstriction and bronchial inflammation (as determined by analysis of bronchial biopsies and BAL fluid). This will give insight in the contribution of tachykinins to the (chronic) inflammatory process in the airways of asthmatic patients. Finally, the contribution of tachykinins and peptidases in asthma may be demonstrated by treating asthmatic patients with recombinant NEP, and analysing the effects on bronchoconstriction induced by allergens or environmental agents such as cigarette smoke.
