The increased influx of travelers through land, air, and sea put Pakistan at higher odds of further spread of coronavirus from neighboring countries. The possibility of further importation of the virus into Pakistan is very high, and because Pakistan has already imported the virus, the country needs to take stringent measures to detect potential cases early in order to curb existing epidemic and tracking steps to prevent further spread. After the unexpected rise in coronavirus cases in Pakistan, the Government of Pakistan has halted trade and transport operations with Iran. Now owing to severe snowfall the land connection with China is blocked. Whereas mobilization is tightly controlled at the boundaries of Chaman and Taftan. Additionally, it monitors external travel to Iraq, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Iran. Weekly, 41 flights operate in Pakistan from 3 cities (Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore) and to 2 destinations in China (Urumqi and Beijing). The danger of virus importation into Pakistan is very high and needs good precautions and strict steps to identify possible cases early and surveillance steps to deter further virus transmission. Pakistan is still in the containment process. The step to shutdown point of entry and borders has been taken. All international flights have been cancelled. In this way, the number of cases might not increase as most of the spread was through worldwide migrants and yet it is impossible to find the point of origin.",

Pakistan does not have any sufficient resources to provide for the patients at the moment. Most of the populace is working on daily wages. The shutdown of the whole country would cause death either due to hunger or from COVID-19. The current statement of Pakistan\u2019s prime minister calls for a community meeting among susceptible countries that are dealing with the pandemic. It has been decided that rather than complete shutdown, people should avoid mass gatherings, and partial shutting down of the country will take place in order for the economy to provide for basic necessities.4",

This is a situation where each individual has to take steps toward minimizing the risk by staying in the house and immobilizing themselves. The airborne, contact transmission can only be disinfected if proper handwashing protocols are followed and each individual carry out precautionary measures to safe other individuals from this debilitating virus.
