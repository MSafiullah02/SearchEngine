In this paper, we identified a porphyrin derivative of Pyropheophorbide a (PPa) from the mussel Musculus senhousei (M. senhousei) that showed broad anti-influenza A virus activity in vitro against a panel of influenza A viral strains. The analysis of the mechanism of action indicated that PPa functions in the early stage of virus infection by interacting with the lipid bilayer of the virion, resulting in an alteration of membrane-associated functions, thereby blocking the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells. In addition, the anti-influenza A virus activity of PPa was further assessed in mice infected with the influenza A virus. The survival rate and mean survival time of mice were apparently prolonged compared with the control group which was not treated with the drug. Therefore, PPa and its derivatives may represent lead compounds for controlling influenza A virus infection. Keywords: Marine food, Musculus senhousei, Pyropheophorbide a, Anti-influenza A virus activity, Enveloped virus. the H5N1 pseudo-typed virus screening approach, we identified the traditional Chinese seafood M. senhousei as showing a good inhibitory activity toward influenza A virus (IAV). The preliminary mechanistic study indicated that the antiviral activity of this food resulted from the inhibition of virus entry during early infection. We then investigated the bioactive components of this mussel using a bioassay-guided approach, from which a porphyrin derivative named pyropheophorbide a (PPa) that showed significant anti-IAV activity in vitro was isolated and identified, indicating a potential application of this molecule in the development of new antiviral agents. IAVs are enveloped viruses, and the viral envelopes are derived from portions of the host cell membranes and function to cover the capsids to protect the packaged viral genome 7 . In addition to the lipid bilayer, the viral envelope also contains viral glycoproteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and the viral M2 protein.

Four different drug administration protocols were employed to treat the virus or cells at the concentration of 5 \u03bcg/mL of PPa. Phase contrast images were obtained using a microscope at 48 h post-infection. 3b Time-of-addition assay. MDCK cells infected with A/PR/8/34(H1N1) (100 TCID 50 ) were treated with 5 \u03bcg/mL PPa at the indicated time intervals. The virus titer was determined by measuring the TCID 50 of virus in the supernatant at 48 h post-infection; * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, and *** p<0.001. 3c Hemagglutinin inhibition assay designed to measure the inhibitory effect of PPa on the binding of the virus to target cells. An equal volume of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) virus (4HAU) was transferred to a microwell plate containing two-fold serially diluted PPa in PBS. Then, erythrocytes (1% v/v in saline) were added to each well. After an incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the hemagglutination reaction was analyzed. PBS without virus served as a positive control, while virus served as the negative control. 3d Hemolysis inhibition assay. A suspension of freshly prepared chicken erythrocytes (2%) was added to the mixture of PPa (15 \u03bcg/mL) with the influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in allantoic fluid. The mixture was then acidified to a pH ranging from 4.6 to 6.0 (sodium acetate, 0.5 M), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation, the mixture was centrifuged and the absorbance of the supernatants containing released hemoglobin was measured at OD 535 using a Multiskan FC microplate reader. 3e Neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay.
