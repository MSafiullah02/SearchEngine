            "text": "Strongyloides stercoralis , an intestinal nematode commonly known as the human threadworm, aff ects millions of people worldwide. 1 It is endemic in Southeast Asia, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of the southeastern USA. 2 In the USA, the highest prevalence rates are found in eastern Kentucky and rural Tennessee. A unique feature of Strongyloides stercoralis infection is the occurrence of an autoinfection cycle which permits persistence of the parasite years after the normal host has left an endemic area. In this cycle, the rhabditiform larvae in the duodenojujenal portion of the small intestine transform directly into fi lariform (infective) larvae. Th e fi lariform larvae without leaving the body can reinfect the patient by penetrating the intestinal mucosa. Th is distinctive characteristic of Strongyloides , to persist and replicate within the host for decades, produces minimal or no symptoms. Immunocompromised patients may develop a fulminant illness due to a unique process in the life cycle of Strongyloides in which there are dramatic increases in the number of fi lariform larvae. In the hyperinfection syndrome, massive numbers of larvae migrate through the intestinal mucosa and into the lungs (the usual migration pattern) and disseminate to involve other organ systems not ordinarily a part of the life cycle of the parasite. Larvae may be found in the central nervous system, kidneys, liver, and almost any other organ.",

            "text": "Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome usually develops in the setting of compromised cell-mediated immunity such as severe malnutrition, chronic infection (lepromatous leprosy, human immunodefi ciency virus [HIV], tuberculosis, or human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 [HTLV]), leukemia, lymphoma, malignancy, or organ transplantation associated with the administration of systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs. 3 , 4 Hyperinfection syndrome can occur after augmentation of steroids or pulse steroids and other immunosuppressive drugs for treatment of transplant graft rejection. Immunosuppressive regimens including cyclosporine for organ transplant recipients have been reported to have a decreased incidence of hyperinfection Strongyloides . Th is has been attributed to the anti-helminthic properties cyclosporine demonstrated in mouse models. 5 Organ transplant recipients can develop hyperinfection syndrome from endogeneous reactivation and by acquisition of Strongyloides from the transplanted organ and obligatory immunosuppression. 6 Th e diagnosis of Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome requires physician awareness of this infection and the clinical setting in which it occurs. Th ere are several clues to the diagnosis: Helminth 10 7. History of residence or travel to an endemic area even many years previously. In any of these clinical settings, the thumbprint sign of periumbilical purpura is pathognomonic of hyperinfection Strongyloides . 9 , 10 Most of the multiple purpuric lesions appear as small ecchymoses, as if caused by the pressure of thumbs or other fi ngers during physical examination of the abdomen. Th e purpura radiates from the umbilicus and progresses to involve the fl anks and proximal lower extremities. Innumerable fi ne petechiae rapidly develop over 24-48 h as a reticulated pattern of linear and serpiginous purpuric streaks. 11 , 12 Th e vascular distribution of the lesions of hyperinfection Strongyloides closely parallels that of the caput medusa seen in chronic liver disease with portal hypertension. In that setting, increased portal pressure leads to retrograde fl ow through the periumbilical portosystemic anastomoses. Th e patients reported with periumbilical purpura had been placed on respirators before the development of their skin lesions. Positive pressure ventilation produces a rise in portal pressure. It is hypothesized that numerous larvae leave the host's bowel through the superior and inferior mesenteric veins entering the liver. Patients receiving respiratory assistance have transient rises in portal pressure, shunting portal blood through the periumbilical portal systemic shunt. Th is blood carries numerous larvae that, on reaching the dermal vascular plexus, cause extravasation of red blood cells. 9 A subtle case of two faint periumbilical purpuric patches was seen by one of the authors in a patient with mild gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms who was not on mechanical ventilation. Skin biopsy revealed the fi lariform larvae of Strongyloides supporting the hypothesis that while the larvae may migrate through the skin during hyperinfection, positive pressure mechanical ventilation is required to produce the classically described periumbilical thumbprint purpura. A 25-year-old Mexican man with acquired immune defi ciency syndrome (AIDS) (CD4 count 70) was hospitalized with GI complaints, weight loss, and numerous 2-3 mm purpuric papules on his abdomen. Skin biopsy demonstrated fi lariform larvae of Strongyloides . 13 Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome can be confi rmed by microscopic examination of the nasogastric aspirates, bronchopulmonary lavage specimens, or skin biopsy. Th e fi lariform larvae are immediately infective, so gloves must be worn when handling these specimens to prevent the larvae from entering mucocutaneous surfaces of the health care worker. Th e skin biopsy from a purpuric patch readily demonstrates Strongyloides fi lariform larvae in and around blood vessels and throughout the dermis in association with extravasated red blood cells. Multiple longitudinal and cross-sections of the larvae are usually seen. Th ere is a signifi cant absence of any infl ammatory cell infi ltrate. Serologic tests are useful in patients with negative stool exams but may not be reliable for immunocompromised hosts. 7 A 60-year-old man, born in Ecuador, had been treated for 7 years for asthma with many courses of systemic steroids. Blood eosinophilia was oft en greater than 15% and attributed to asthma aft er a negative stool for ova and parasites. On his last hospital admission because of respiratory distress he was intubated. Less than 12 h later he developed periumbilical purpura ",
