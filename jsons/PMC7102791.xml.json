            "text": "The progress in influenza surveillance and response in the Region has been hampered by the fragility of the health systems as a result of protracted humanitarian crises and civil war. From the viewpoint of influenza surveillance programme of WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, a number of issues were highlighted in the plenary discussions as challenges which hampers to improvement of influenza surveillance and response system in the Region (Box 1\n). A summary of these challenges identified in the plenary discussions are shown in Box-1. Because of the constant evolution of influenza viruses, and the limitations in knowledge and control measures, two essential elements of surveillance and response to influenza are collecting good quality data year round and testing samples using a systematic sampling strategy. Timely sharing and reporting of data are also critical in order to achieve optimal disease control.Box 1Challenges to improving and sustaining influenza surveillance system in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.\n\u2022The influenza surveillance system does not operate all year round. Until the influenza season in the Region is well defined, data collection, sampling and testing of the influenza virus should be conducted all year.\u2022Clinicians are often unaware of the need to use consistent and systematic surveillance case definitions for severe acute respiratory infection/influenza-like illness (SARI/ILI) and to enrol only cases meeting the case definitions.\u2022The virological and epidemiological components are often not integrated into the SARI/ILI surveillance system and are not part of the national routine disease surveillance and reporting system (often the SARI/ILI surveillance system is considered a stand-alone vertical system which is fund-driven).\u2022There is a tendency to collect too many non-essential data which can overwhelm the system. Efforts should be directed to collecting minimum essential data from sentinel sites in accordance with the nationally defined objectives of the SARI/ILI surveillance system.\u2022Public funding to sustain and maintain the SARI/ILI surveillance system is often lacking and relies on donor funding.\u2022SARI/ILI surveillance data are not used enough to provide alerts and epidemic thresholds and assess the severity of influenza in a given influenza season. This leads to either late detection or no detection at all of a seasonal surge or an influenza outbreak.\u2022Countries do not have a consistent or systematic sampling strategy for collecting clinical samples from SARI and ILI cases and testing for influenza virus. As a result, influenza cases and the disease burden associated with influenza are underestimated in many countries.\u2022A lag time often exists between data collection and influenza testing, or influenza testing and sharing of the test results for public reporting, as well as sharing influenza virus specimens for vaccine strain selection. This results in poor understanding of the types of influenza virus circulating in real time and also increases the probability of vaccine mismatch specific to the Region.\u2022A standard protocol is lacking, including a validated algorithm for testing and diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viruses using multiplex respiratory assays where specimens are tested both for influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses. The absence or inadequacy of appropriate diagnostic facilities to define the viral etiology of severe pneumonia is a problem and means that many acute lower respiratory infections are undiagnosed and hence that viral pneumonia incidence rates are underestimated.\u2022Annual projections of the requirements for reagents and consumable laboratory supplies for the detection and diagnosis of seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses based on a well-defined sampling strategy are often lacking. This can lead to stock outs in the middle of a busy influenza season.\u2022Countries often do not use the data generated locally from their surveillance systems to define control policies and practices that can reduce the influenza disease burden in the general population.\u2022Countries do not use the surveillance data to better understand the economic burden of influenza and often undervalue the role of control policies such as use of vaccines to reduce healthcare-associated severe influenza illness.\u2022In countries where control policies exist and are implemented, such as the use of seasonal influenza vaccines, surveillance data are not used to monitor the effectiveness of these policies and interventions.\nTo improve surveillance for influenza, the following actions are needed.\u2022Sustain the existing platform for influenza surveillance in order to detect and monitor threats from new and emerging respiratory viruses.\u2022Make available good quality data and a common stock of diagnostic kits and reagents.\u2022Involve academia and the private sector, and ensure continued coordination, information sharing and joint actions at the human-animal interface.\u2022Estimate the economic burden of influenza.\u2022Develop key guiding measures for pandemic influenza.\u2022Develop long-term plans for the use of seasonal influenza vaccines, at least among high-risk groups.\nAlt-text: Box 1",

            "text": "Seven panel discussions were held on a broad range of topics. Panellists comprised ministry of health officials managing the influenza programme in their countries, academia, scientists and WHO staff who discussed ways to sustain the influenza programmes, the value of improving the system to better manage other health security threats, and how to improve the use of surveillance data for influenza control strategies and monitor the effectiveness of control intervention (Box 2\n).Box 2Key action points discussed during the panel discussions.Sustainable actions to improve the quality of data collection and analysis\u2022The existing platform for influenza surveillance should be enhanced and sustained for detection and monitoring of threats from circulation of seasonal, pandemic and zoonotic influenza viruses with epidemic potential.\u2022Emphasis should be placed on: improving the quality of data collection and systematic analysis; promoting timely and complete public reporting of data; and enhancing prompt virus sharing to avoid vaccine mismatch.\u2022The quality of the influenza surveillance system should be evaluated regularly using a standardized approach in order to improve data quality, analysis and influenza sampling.\u2022An electronic-based system should be promoted for data entry and storage to improve real-time data analysis and data quality,\nBetter use of influenza surveillance data for public health decisions-making\u2022Surveillance data should be used regularly to assess the severity of seasonal, epidemic and pandemic influenza; data should always be linked to its use in public health actions, especially to develop policies for influenza control.\u2022Greater collaboration should be established between the ministries of health, academia and the private sector so as to translate research findings into optimal strategies, policies and practices for influenza control.\u2022Surveillance data should also be used to monitor the effectiveness of control programmes or interventions in reducing deaths and disabilities from influenza and influenza-associated illness. Collaboration between scientific communities, academia and the public sector on the use of such data for informed decision-making would contribute to capacity building.\nSustaining influenza virological surveillance: actions needed by the countries\u2022National influenza centres should build and maintain sequencing capacity for both seasonal influenza and other non-influenza respiratory viruses.\u2022Greater use should be made of the FluNet and EMFLU platforms for timely influenza data reporting.\u2022National influenza centres should share the influenza virus specimens with the WHO collaborating centres promptly to avoid vaccine mismatch.\nIncreasing the use and uptake of seasonal influenza vaccines in the Eastern Mediterranean Region\u2022Vaccination against seasonal influenza should be recognized as part of pandemic influenza preparedness. In countries with low vaccine uptake and in general, a case should be developed for economic investment in seasonal influenza vaccination highlighting the saving in healthcare cost that can be made as a result of the substantial decrease in influenza incidence through yearly vaccination.\u2022Best practices for introducing and managing seasonal influenza vaccination through national immunization programme should be shared with the countries so they can develop appropriate policies and practices to increase the use and uptake of seasonal influenza vaccines.\u2022In countries where the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is low or fragmented in the general population, seasonal influenza vaccination in high-risk groups should be considered an incremental gain. Of the high-risk groups, healthcare workers should be targeted for voluntary or mandatory vaccination backed up with policies and strong advocacy and awareness campaigns on the introduction of the vaccination and monitoring of coverage and uptake.\u2022Increasing the uptake and monitoring the vaccination coverage will still be a challenge. Coverage of seasonal influenza vaccines should be monitored periodically using population-based data and measures taken to correct any problems.\u2022Countries will need policies to support the introduction of seasonal influenza vaccines based on local evidence and analysis of their influenza burden and the likely effect of vaccination.\u2022Studies should be conducted on the use of and barriers to access to seasonal influenza vaccines in the general population and high-risk groups.\nOne Health for influenza surveillance: actions needed to improve detection and response\u2022Detection of and response to zoonotic influenza with epidemic potential can be improved by enhancing surveillance at the human-animal interface including periodic information sharing and joint risk assessment between the animal and human health sectors.\u2022The public health response to zoonotic influenza will rely on joint surveillance, investigation and laboratory detection under the One Health framework\nUsing the influenza platform for surveillance of respiratory syncytial virus and other emerging respiratory virus threats\u2022Surveillance for respiratory syncytial virus should be piloted using the same sentinel-based surveillance platforms used for severe acute respiratory infection.\u2022National influenza centres should build capacities to detect non-influenza respiratory viruses, especially for molecular detection of respiratory syncytial virus and sequencing of genotypes.\u2022Should vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus become available, surveillance data should be regularly analysed to better understand the burden, epidemiology and seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus.\nAccelerating progress against pandemic threats: actions needed by the countries to prevent, detect and respond\u2022The surveillance platform for severe acute respiratory infection should be enhanced and sustained to detect any new influenza or other respiratory viruses with epidemic potential in real time.\u2022Essential capacities for managing the risk and effect of pandemic influenza need to be linked with the core capacities required to manage broader health security threats in the country.\u2022Planning for pandemic influenza preparedness should be considered in the context of strengthening the core capacity of the International Health Regulations and should be a part of national action plan for health security.\u2022The national pandemic influenza preparedness plan should be updated and reviewed using WHO\u2019s planning guidance and checklists. The plan should be tested periodically using desktop or other simulation exercises.\nAlt-text: Box 2",
