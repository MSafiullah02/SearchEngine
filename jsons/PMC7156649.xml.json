Intestinal adsorbents are a group of specific products, which adsorb and excrete present in the intestine gases, pathogens, allergens, exotoxins and endotoxins from the body. Based on safety and efficacy data of enterosorbents administration, it has been concluded that administration of these products can be recommended as a primary tool for the acute diarrhea treatment for rapid and effective prevention of fluid and electrolyte loss and symptom improvement16,17.

The ROC (receive operation curve characteristics) analysis was used to evaluate the logistic regression model. The power of the model\u2019s predicted values to discriminate between positive and negative cases is quantified by the Area under the ROC curve (AUC).
