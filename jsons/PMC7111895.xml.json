            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized illness that spread from southern China in late 2002/early 2003 to several countries in Asia, Europe and North America (Guan et al., 2003). SARS usually begins with a fever greater than 38 \u00b0C. Initial symptoms can also include headache, malaise, and mild respiratory symptoms. Within 2 days to a week, SARS patients may develop a dry cough and have trouble breathing. Patients in more advanced stages of SARS develop either pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. In the initial outbreak, there were 8098 cases worldwide, with an overall mortality of 9.6% (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). A previously unrecognized coronavirus (CoV) has been demonstrated to be the cause of the new disease (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). In a remarkably short period of time, the entire genetic sequences of several strains of the novel SARS-CoV were determined and the virion receptor identified (Li et al., 2003). Similar CoV have been isolated from civets and other animals that are trapped for food or medicine at live animal markets in Guangdong province China, the presumed epicenter of the outbreak (Guan et al., 2003). SARS-CoV or a closely related CoV also infects animals in the wild and appears to have entered the human population in the past (Zheng et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Current strategies for the treatment of SARS patients have included broad-spectrum antibiotics, glucocorticoids and ribavirin (Fujii et al., 2004); however, the efficacy of these treatments is still unclear. Therefore, to develop better treatment strategies for future outbreaks, it is imperative to understand the relationship between the virus and the host immune system. Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) are important components of the host immune response to viral infections. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 are produced by most cells as a direct response to viral infection, while IFN-\u03b3 is synthesized almost exclusively by activated natural killer (NK) cells and activated T cells in response to virus-infected cells (Pfeffer et al., 1998). Both types of IFNs achieve their antiviral effects by inducing the synthesis of several proteins that interfere with viral replication (Goodbourn et al., 2000). Several studies have examined the anti-viral effects of IFNs against SARS-CoV. Although results from clinical studies using IFN-\u03b1 are inconclusive (Haagmans et al., 2004, Loutfy et al., 2003), in vitro studies strongly suggest that IFN-\u03b2 at concentrations greater than 1000 U/ml can marginally inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV (Cinatl et al., 2003, Hensley et al., 2004, Spiegel et al., 2004, Stroher et al., 2004). Likewise, analysis of cytokine levels in SARS patients suggests that the presence of IFN-\u03b3 at the early stages of disease onset correlates with resolution of the viral infection (D. Kelvin and M. Cameron, personal communication); however, IFN-\u03b3 has little antiviral effect against SARS-CoV in vitro (Cinatl et al., 2003, Spiegel et al., 2004). Recent studies examining the anti-viral effects of IFNs against both RNA and DNA viruses have shown that when used in combination, IFN-\u03b3 synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) to inhibit the replication of viruses such as herpes simplex virus type-1 (Sainz and Halford, 2002), hepatitis C virus (Larkin et al., 2003), Lassa virus (Asper et al., 2004), and cytomegalovirus (Sainz et al., unpublished data). To further test this principle, we examined the antiviral effects of recombinant IFN-\u03b2 and/or IFN-\u03b3 against SARS-CoV replication in vitro.",

At 72 h p.i. however, viral titers in IFN-\u03b2- or IFN-\u03b3-treated cultures approached levels of that detected in vehicle-treated groups (Figs. 2A, B). Relative to vehicle control cultures, viral titers recovered at 72 h p.i. from cultures treated with either IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 were reduced by 3-fold in Urbani-infected cultures (Fig. 2D), and 5- and 2-fold in HK-infected cultures, respectively (Fig. 2E). As with our plaque reduction assays, we observed a potent inhibitory effect when Vero cultures were treated with both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. Compared to viral titers of greater than 1 \u00d7 105 PFU/ml in vehicle-treated cells, in cultures treated with 100 U/ml each of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, Urbani replicated to titers of 55, 11 and 6 PFU/ml at 24, 48 and 72 h p.i., respectively (Fig. 2A), and HK replicated to titers 324, 79 and 17 PFU/ml at 24, 48 and 72 h p.i., respectively (Fig. 2B). The inhibitory effect achieved with combination IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 treatment was consistently greater than 3000-fold at all time points tested and reached levels of greater than 1 \u00d7 105-fold at 72 h p.i. relative to vehicle treated Vero E6 cells (Figs. 2D, E). In contrast, when tested against MHV-A59, combination IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 treatment showed only a 8-10-fold increased antiviral effect when compared to cultures treated with IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 separately (Figs. 2C, F). Similar results were obtained on 17CL-1 cells (data not shown). Although this result would suggest that the synergistic antiviral effect observed in cultures treated with both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 is specific to SARS-CoV, we cannot exclude the possibility that the effect observed with regards to MHV plaque formation and replication is cell type-specific.",

Moreover, as compared to vehicle-treated and individually IFN-treated cultures, the degree of CPE observed in cells treated with both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 is less evident at 120 h p.i., and monolayers appeared evenly stained with little to no visible CPE (Figs. 3D, H).

For example, a synergistic relationship would exist if the level of inhibition achieved with 100 U/ml of IFN-\u03b2 plus 100 U/ml of IFN-\u03b3 were significantly greater than the level of inhibition achieved with 200 U/ml of either IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 separately. The plaque reduction data presented in Table 1 support this inequality and suggest a synergistic antiviral relationship between type I and type II IFNs with regards to SARS-CoV plaque formation. Likewise, the fold-inhibition data presented in Fig. 2 strongly supports the hypothesis that IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 synergistically inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV. Specifically, if the observed effect were additive, then the level of inhibition in viral replication predicted for cultures treated with 100 U/ml of both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 would be equal to the sum of the level of inhibition achieved in culture treated with 100 U/ml of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 separately. For both Urbani and HK (Figs. 2D, E), the level of inhibition achieved in cultures treated with 100 U/ml of both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 was approximately 1000 times greater than the sum of the fold-inhibition achieved in cultures treated with 100 U/ml of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 separately (P<0.001). More extensive synergistic analyses will need to be conducted to formally prove synergy; however, the data presented herein strongly argue in favor of this hypothesis.",

We hypothesize that the difference in CPE may be reflective of the different IFN pathways used by each IFN respectively, and may be an essential factor when considering the mechanism by which IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 synergistically inhibit SARS-CoV replication. Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) activate distinct but related Jak/STAT signal cascades resulting in the transcription of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (Goodbourn et al., 2000). Although similar genes are activated by all three IFNs, Der, et al. have identified numerous genes differentially regulated by IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 using oligonucleotide arrays (Der et al., 1998). In particular, IFN-\u03b2 stimulation resulted in the identification of twice as many genes as compared to IFN-\u03b3. This differential regulation of IFN-induced genes may explain in part the synergistic effect achieved with both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. It remains to be determined, however, the profile of different IFN-stimulated genes present in cells treated with both type I and type II IFNs.",

It is unknown, however, whether these draconian containment measures can be sustained with each appearance of the SARS-CoV in humans. The immune response to SARS-CoV infection appears capable of clearing the infection in most individuals. By reducing SARS-CoV load it may be possible to extend the window of time during which an effective immune response could arise. Thus, treatments that reduce SARS-CoV load by several logs in infected individuals could enable more individuals to control, eliminate and survive SARS-CoV infections. Combination IFN treatment therefore warrants further consideration as a treatment for SARS.",
