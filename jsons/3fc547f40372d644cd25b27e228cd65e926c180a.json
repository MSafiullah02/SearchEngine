Today, HIV has ravaged Black communities by disproportionately affecting Blacks who maintain the highest rates of infection amongst all racial groups [15] .

By the end of January 2020, the first US case was reported in Washington state and was identified in a man who had returned from Wuhan; by the end of March, the US became the epicenter of the pandemic accounting for the most reported cases worldwide.

They emphasize that the existing and pervasive disparities will likely ensure that a national response will not impact American communities equally. The importance of the racial and ethnic breakdown of those affected cannot be overemphasized and may also impact philanthropic initiatives reaching communities [19] . The concern is that while there is an existing threat of an infectious disease that has the potential to infect and devastate many, the particularly vulnerable will experience a greater proportion of disease burden and social upheaval that includes increased mortality, limited health care access, economic collapse with loss of wages and housing, and an overall lack of resources and equity to sustain in a dynamic crisis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 490, "end": 494, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 806, "end": 810, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A Request for Data"}, {"text": "When COVID-19 arrived in the US and progressed to infect hundreds of thousands of Americans, it was evident that all institutions and industries were not prepared for the crisis.

In particular, the health care system quickly realized that the rapid influx of ailing citizens would outpace the available supplies from personal protective equipment to ventilators, and even personnel. The economic collapse is unimaginable and continues to unfold. A great concern is that by not systematically identifying the affected, we may repeat similar acts of unpreparedness when addressing the racial and ethnic disparities of the disease. Therefore, all measures taken must entail concerted and deliberate efforts that incorporate the expertise of leaders in the field to address high-priority issues, and any haphazard attempts will not suffice and may even exacerbate the feeble conditions of the most vulnerable. First and foremost, data and trends on numbers from racial and ethnic groups affected by COVID-19 must be provided by the state and national health departments. Second, we must prospectively understand and respond to the specific challenges taking place with people of color and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We call for a National Commission on COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, a dedicated body to envisage essential recourse and mobilize to action the necessary safeguards.
