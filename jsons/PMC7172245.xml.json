            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a member of the Coronaviridae, is the etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), which is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration in approximately 2-week-old suckling piglets (Goodwin and Jennings, 1985, Mullan et al., 1994). TGE results in serious economic losses in swine-producing areas worldwide. TGEV has a large, 28.5 kb single-stranded positive sense RNA genome, which comprises four structural proteins encoded by the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleoprotein (N) genes (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Eleouet et al., 1995). Many cell types are susceptible to TGEV, including pig thyroid cells, swine testis cells (ST), pig kidney cells (PK-15, IBRS-2) and salivary gland cells (Nguyen et al., 1987, Haelterman and Hutchings, 1956). IBRS-2, PK-15 and ST cell lines are used commonly to culture TGEV in the laboratory (Chen et al., 1993). In vivo, TGEV replicates in intestinal epithelial cells of susceptible animals, causing cellular degeneration, villus shortening, malabsorption and diarrhea (Haelterman, 1972, Schwegmaan-wessels and Herrler, 2006).",

            "text": "Most studies concerning TGEV pathogenesis in swine have been performed in animal infection models. Only rarely have in vitro studies been used with cell lines originating from porcine intestines. Cell lines IPEC-1, IPEC-J2 and IPI-2I have been used in in vitro model systems (Fangning et al., 2010, Valentina et al., 2009, Peter et al., 2006). However, data concerning these cell lines, and the morphogenesis and proliferation of the virus in the target cells, are scarce. Thus, we developed an in vitro model based on porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) infected with TGEV, and used transmission electron microscopy (TEM), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) to investigate the infection mechanism of TGEV. TGEV N genes are highly homologous and are essential for replication. The N gene encodes the nucleocapsid protein, which is a highly basic protein with a molecular mass ranging from 40 to 63 kDa, depending on the species and strain (Escors et al., 2001). The N protein\u2019s function involves cessation of cell division and extension of the cell cycle to provide more suitable conditions for virus assembly (Liu et al., 2001\nMotokawa et al., 1996, Kapke and Brian, 1986). This is especially significant when the viral life cycle is longer than that of the host cell cycle (Wurm et al., 2001). Therefore, to analyze the TGEV proliferation in target cells, a one-step growth curve was constructed according to the FQ-PCR data for the transcription dynamics of the N gene.",

The reaction conditions were: 39 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 95 \u00b0C for 5 s and 54 \u00b0C for 30 s. The reaction for each sample was repeated three times and a negative control was included. The copy numbers of the gene were obtained from the test sample and used to construct a one-step growth curve for TGEV.",

At 6 h post-infection, many TGEV particles bound to goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC showed green fluorescence when exposed to laser light and were located in the cytoplasm. At 24 h, the fluorescence transferred to the perinuclear area, before decreasing gradually at 48 h. Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), a cellular receptor for TGEV, is abundantly expressed in the membrane of porcine IECs (data not shown), which suggested that pAPN plays a role in mediating TGEV infection. In addition, we demonstrated that ST cells could be infected with the culture supernatant of IECs infected TGEV at 24 h.

A previous report also suggested that viral genome and structural proteins were assembled into virus particles in the area between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi, and that the particles were transported to the extracellular space through budding of vesicles (Corse and Machamer, 2000, Lili and Masters, 2010). Until now, the morphology of TGEV in target cells had not explored in detail. In this study, TGEV particles in porcine epithelial cells were observed to have a diameter ranging from 80 to 120 nm, which was consistent with previous reports. The infectious virions entered the target cells by membrane fusion and mature viruses budded into vacuoles, which were gradually transported to the cell membrane before being released.",
