They include some of the most important agents of human disease as well as members of the normal human flora. Some streptococci have been associated mainly with disease in animals, while others have been domesticated and used for the culture of buttermilk, yogurt, and certain cheeses. Those known to cause human disease comprise two broad categories: First are the pyogenic streptococci, including the familiar \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. These organisms are not generally part of the normal flora but cause acute, often severe, infections in normal hosts. Second are the more diverse enteric and oral streptococci, which are nearly always part of the normal flora and which are more frequently associated with opportunistic infections.",

(1) The group A Streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes, produces a wide range of infections, from pharyngitis and impetigo to puerperal sepsis, erysipelas, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome. Their nonsuppurative sequelae include acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. (2) The group B Streptococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae, is currently a leading cause of sepsis in newborn infants and a frequent cause of postpartum infections in mothers. (3) The pneumococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, remains the most frequent cause of bacterial pneumonia in all age groups and is a common agent in otitis media, bacteremia, and meningitis. A detailed account of the pneumococcus may be found in Chapter 29. (4) Among the oral streptococci, Streptococcus mutans is important as a principal agent of dental caries. (5) The Enterococcus is part of the normal bowel flora and has been increasingly isolated as an opportunistic invader, especially in nosocomial infections. Enterococcus is now a separate genus but will be considered an honorary Streptococcus in this chapter because of its similarities to enteric streptococci.",

            "text": "Streptococcal infections were recognized by Greek physicians by the third century BC. A description of erysipelas is recorded in Epidemicus and attributed to Hippocrates. In the Middle Ages, scarlet fever, or \u201cscarlatina,\u201d as it was called in Italy, was an eye-catching and notable disease. Sydenham\u2019s description in 1676 clearly differentiated this disease from measles and other rashes, but it was not until 1924 that G.F. and G.H. Dick showed conclusively that streptococci were the causative agents. Until the advent of penicillin, childbed fever, or puerperal sepsis, remained one of the most frequent causes of death among otherwise healthy young women. The classic works of Holmes, in 1858, and Semmelweiss, in 1861, described the transmission of this disease and provided guidelines for effective infection control and preventive measures that are still applicable today. Rheumatic fever was first described by Wells in 1812, and Bouillaud described the association of acute rheumatism and heart disease in 1835. In 1836, Bright published his account of \u201crenal disease accompanied with secretion of albuminous urine.\u201d(1) Osler provided detailed descriptions of \u201cmalignant scarlet fever,\u201d which remained common until the advent of antibiotics (see Figure 1). Severe invasive diseases, including necrotizing fasciitis, \u201chemolytic streptococcus gangrene,\u201d and myositis were much less common and did not appear in the medical literature until the second and third decades of this century. During the mid-1970s to 1980s, cases of acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis became exceedingly rare (see Figure 2), and streptococcal disease seemed to become only an inconvenience. By the late 1980s, however, rheumatic fever made dramatic reappearance at military posts and in Utah and other areas of the United States.(2,3) There was also a dramatic increase in severe invasive infections and the emergence of a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.(4) Group A streptococci made the headlines in the popular press as \u201cKiller Strep,\u201d the \u201cflesh-eating bacteria.\u201d\n\n\n",

By the 1880s many species had been given names such as Streptococcus epidemicus, Streptococcus erysipelatus, Streptococcus scarlatinae, and Streptococcus rheumaticus, which reflected different manifestations of streptococcal infection. The name S. pyogenes dates from this period but is probably of less descriptive value than the term \u201cStreptococcus haemolyticus,\u201d which was commonly used through the early part of this century. The formal classification of streptococci began when blood agar came into use and the hemolytic properties of various organisms were noted. In 1919, Brown used the term \u201cbeta\u201d to describe streptococci that produced a 2- to 4-mm zone of clear hemolysis around colonies grown on blood agar. \u201cAlpha\u201d streptococci were those producing incomplete, greenish, hemolysis. Most of the isolates from severe human disease were \u03b2-hemolytic. It was not until 1928, when Lancefield introduced methods of serotyping streptococci based on immunologic reactions with cellular components, that groups and types within groups could be clearly distinguished. The group antigens were eventually shown to be specific cell wall carbohydrates. The group A streptococci were further differentiated by the M and T protein antigens. The \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci from most human infections proved to be those of group A. Armed with these new epidemiologic tools, Lancefield and Hare investigated cases of puerperal sepsis at Queen Charlotte\u2019s Hospital in London, beginning in the early 1930s.(5) Of 46 cases of postpartum sepsis, all but oneisolate was group A, and the exception was identified as the prototype of a new serologic group, designated group G. A year earlier, Hare and Colebrook observed that hemolytic streptococci resembling those associated with sepsis were never found in vaginal cultures of healthy women, but that some women carried streptococci that resembled those isolated in bovine mastitis. The latter organisms proved to be members of Streptococcus group B.(5)",

The advent of antibiotics, along with better methods for preventing nosocomial spread, resulted in a dramatic decline in streptococcal infections on obstetrical services. At Queen Charlotte\u2019s Hospital there were very few maternal deaths due to either group A or group B streptococci from 1940 to the mid-1960s. In this same period there were few cases of neonatal sepsis or meningitis attributed to streptococci of any kind in large series published in the pediatric literature. It appears unlikely that group B streptococci went simply unrecognized as perinatal pathogens for over 20 years. Rather, there seems to have been a real increase in group B disease, beginning in the United States and Europe during the 1960s. By the mid-1970s, numerous reports of group B disease appeared in the literature, and the group B Streptococcus was said to have come of age.",

These and several new Enterococcus species were clearly distinct from the \u201cnonenterococcal\u201d group D streptococci, Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus equinus. Enterococci have long been known as an occasional cause of opportunistic infections, but in the early 1970s they began to appear with increasing frequency in reports of urinary tract infection, bacteremia, and pelvic, wound, and surgical infections. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are now among the most common organisms causing nosocomial infections and are difficult to eradicate because of resistance to an increasing number of antibiotics.(12)",

This was expanded to include 10 large metropolitan and regional areas (about 30 million persons or 10% of the US population) as part of the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) program of the Emerging Infections Programs Network.(13) Surveillance of group B streptococcal disease was subsequently added.(14) The ABCs have also facilitated tracking of pneumococcal disease incidence and of drug-resistant pneumococci.(15) In Europe, until recently, an informal questionnaire system has been used to track group B streptococcal disease rates(16) and pneumococcal disease has been assessed mainly by review of published reports from individual countries and localities. These efforts have now evolved into more integrated international programs, including strep-EURO(17) and Pcn-EURO.(18) Some national public health centers publish their own more detailed surveillance data. Of particular interest are reports on invasive groups A, B, C, and G streptococcal infections in Denmark 1999\u20132002(19) and a 10-year survey of invasive group A streptococcal infections in the Netherlands.(20) There has been little monitoring of enterococcal infections and vancomycin-resistant enterococci except in the United States from reports of hospitals participating in the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System.(21)",

Group A streptococci are extremely sensitive and uniformly show a zone of inhibition, whereas only 5\u201310% of group C or G strains may give a false-positive result. The simplest of several tests for group B streptococci is the CAMP test (described by Christie, Atkins, and Munch-Petersen in 1944). The test is performed by inoculating a streak of the group B streptococcus perpendicular to a streak of S. aureus on a sheep blood agar plate; an arrowhead-shaped area of complete hemolysis indicates the presence of CAMP factor, which enhances the effect of the staphylococcal \u03b2 lysin. Streptococci reported simply as \u201cnot A or B\u201d on the basis of presumptive tests usually prove to be group C or G. Pneumococci are distinguished from other \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci by sensitivity to optochin in a manner similar to that of the bacitracin test for group A streptococci. In addition, the bile solubility test of Neufeld remains useful for separating pneumococci from the occasional optochin-sensitive viridans Streptococcus. Enterococci are identified by growth on bile-esculin media and in 6.5% NaCl. Further identification of these and the viridans streptococci is done with various panels of biochemical tests.",

The T proteins are trypsin-resistant antigens that are not associated with protection but are useful markers for certain M types and for strains having no detectable M protein. T typing is done first by agglutination after trypsinization of the streptococcal cells. M typing is then done on the basis of T typing results, after an acid extraction step and precipitation with specific antisera. For example, T1 strains are invariably M1, and T3 strains are M3, whereas T8/25/Imp.19 strains may be M2, 55, or 57. About 93 M types are internationally recognized, but a quarter or more of isolates are not typeable with either T or M antisera. The major technical difficulties with this system are the difficulty in making antisera and validating new M types by functional protection testis. Testing for many of the less common but established M types cannot be done simply because typing sera are no longer available.(33) One method to overcome these problems is a surrogate typing system based on the neutralization of opacity factor (OF) described by Fraser and Maxted in 1979 and later modified by Johnson and Kaplan.(34) This test is relatively simple and correlates well with M typing. A second surrogate for M typing is \u201cemm typing,\u201d which is based on the DNA sequences of putative M protein genes, described in the next section.",

In addition to the 93 classically validated M types, 110 officially designated emm types have been described, along with many more provision types and subtypes. The CDC maintains a dedicated, curated web site and searchable database of validated emm types, provisional types, and subtypes (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/strepindex.htm). This has been especially useful for epidemiological tracking of otherwise nontypeable strains. It also has the advantage that emm types can be identified in isolates that express only small amounts of M protein and are only weakly antigenic in conventional M typing.(33) Nevertheless, the emm typing is not without its own set of difficulties. Many strains have several emm or M protein-like genes that may look like M protein genes but code for proteins with lectin-like functions, such as binding of immunoglobulins or fibronectin, and some appear to be extra copies or even defective genes. The amplification and/or detection of these genes may depend greatly upon the selection of primers and the conditions of the assay.",

Depending upon the primers utilized, species-specific and sometimes strain-specific identification may be possible. Because ribosomal RNA nucleotide sequences are highly conserved, few differences may be seen even between strains of differing M types.(52) Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) relies upon endonucleases, such as SmaI or SfiI, that cut DNA at relatively fewer sites, producing longer more distinctively sized fragments. These large (20\u2013500 kb) fragments must be resolved using pulse field gel electrophoresis, hence the more familiar name, PFGE. PFGE has proved useful in a wide variety of epidemiological studies.(53) Various methods similar to those just described have been employed for epidemiological studies of group B(54) and group G(55) streptococci, pneumococci,(56) and enterococci.(57,58) Molecular methods have also focused on genes of particular interest because of their function in disease, antibiotic susceptibility, or epidemiology. Two highly pathogenic clones of group A Streptococcus were tracked and delineated by the allelic variants of their scarlet fever toxin (SPE-A), serotyping, and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE).(59)",

These segments vary among isolates and yield gene products of different lengths that can be separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels. The banding patterns (done individually or in a multiplex) are highly reproducible and most systems have powers of resolution equal to that of MLST. MLVA is generally cheaper, much easier to perform, but more suitable for short-term outbreak investigations than for long-term population studies, compared to MLST. In some systems each allele associated with given locus is assigned a number corresponding to the number of tandem repeats, thus giving a numerical repeat profile that can be compared without reference to the gel pattern itself.(68) MLVA methods have been applied to pneumococci,(69) E. faecalis,(68) and E. faecium.(70) However, the current MLVA typing scheme for E. faecium was found to be somewhat less discriminatory than MLST and PFGE for hospital studies.(71)",

These are listed in Table 5 and further described in Section 4. Tests for antibody to M proteins, which confer immunity, and to the group A carbohydrate have been used primarily for research purposes. Assays used clinically for confirmation of recent infections have been reviewed by Shet and Kaplan.(72) The antistreptolysin O (ASO) is the most reliable and is widely available. It is of no immediate value in the diagnosis of acute streptococcal pharyngitis, and it should not be expected to differentiate carriage from infection. Nevertheless, about 80% of patients with rheumatic fever or pharyngitis-associated acute glomerulonephritis infection will mount a significant ASO response. A rise in titer is usually seen 3\u20136 weeks after infection, and a rise, even if modest, is more helpful than a single determination. Test kits give a titer of >166 Todd units as elevated for adults, but there is considerable variation in the \u201cnormal\u201d values among populations and laboratories. In general, single ASO titers above 250 in adults and above 300 in school-aged children are considered elevated. Compared to pharyngitis, skin infections tend to elicit feeble ASO responses but greater responses to DNase B. The anti-DNase B titer peaks later, at 6\u20138 weeks after either skin or throat infections. This test is often useful when the initial ASO is low or negative. There is less clinical experience with the anti-hyaluronidase and anti-streptokinase tests, although they may give comparable results and may be useful as confirmatory tests. The Streptozyme\u00ae hemagglutination test (Wampole Laboratories, Stamford, CT) is a crude screening test based on reactions with a mixture of streptococcal antigens, including streptolysin O, DNase, NADase, streptokinase, and hyaluronidase. It is simple and widely available but is not considered sufficiently reliable by many authorities. Positive responses appear earlier (1\u20132 weeks) and should always be confirmed with one or more of the standardized assays whenever rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis is suspected.(30)\n",

Although immunity appears to be lifelong, most humans are usually infected by only a few different types and remain susceptible to the other types. Thus, repeated episodes of streptococcal infection may be due to different types rather than to a failure of host response. Certain M types, especially M1 and M3, have been associated with more severe forms of disease, and some are more common in pyoderma and acute glomerulonephritis(4,36) (see Table 3). Others have historically been associated with acute rheumatic fever and are referred to as \u201crheumatogenic\u201d types. Although rheumatogenicity is not determined by M type alone, evidence for the cross-reactivity of certain M proteins with heart and brain tissue strongly suggests autoimmune mechanisms for the etiology of acute rheumatic fever and Sydenham\u2019s chorea.(74,75)",

These enzymes have been implicated as factors in streptococcal toxic shock, where they appear to be potent activators of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other cytokines.(4,88) There are three classic antigenically distinct toxins, designated SPE A, B, and C. All group A streptococci carry a gene (speB) that codes for SPE B, but it is not understood why some strains are stronger producers of the toxin than others. SPE A and SPE C are encoded by lysogenic bacteriophages, and only those strains infected by the phages are capable of producing toxin. Humans make antibodies to SPE A, B, and C, which appear to confer toxin-specific immunity to scarlet fever. It is possible to have scarlet fever more than once, due to different toxins. A large family of SPEs (so far SPE D\u2013M) have now been identified with various pyrogenic, mitogenic, and superantigen properties.(89) The classic determination of susceptibility to scarlet fever is the Dick test.(1) Seldom used today, it is based on the observation that patients with antibody to a specific toxin show no response to a small intradermal injection of that toxin (negative Dick test). Susceptible individuals, who have no antibody to neutralize the toxin, develop inflammation at the injection site within 24 h (positive Dick test). SPE A shares structural and physiologic similarities with TSST-1, one of the toxins associated with staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (see also Section 7.1).",

A key feature is that all have terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) residues that are major immunodeterminants. The capsules are antiphagocytic and require specific antibody for efficient opsonization. The quantity of sialic acid-containing antigen appears to be directly related to size and density of the capsule and to virulence in animal models.(90,91) The capsular material itself appears to inhibit the activation and chemotactic functions of neutrophils.(92) Many group B strains are also capable of binding fibrinogen to their surface in a manner that competes with the nonspecific binding of C3 complement.(87,92)",

Group G streptococci may have the type 12 M protein of group A or similar surface proteins, as well as antibody-binding proteins. The group C streptococci from human, equine, and porcine sources produce species-specific streptokinases that are otherwise similar to those of group A.(104) A streptokinase derived from group C has been used clinically in attempts to clear clotted intravascular catheters, to lyse pleural adhesions in patients with lung infections, and to help remove clots in patients with coronary artery occlusions. Group G streptococci also produce streptokinases. We have described a patient with nephritis following infection with a group G strain that had a low-molecular-weight enzyme similar to the nephritis strain-associated protein of group A.(105)",

            "text": "The enteric and oral streptococci are usually unencapsulated. Some in the S. anginosis (milleri) group appear to have capsules more often when found in abscesses, and the capsules play a role in protection from phagocytosis.(106) Few toxins or noxious enzymes have been described among the enteric and oral streptococci, but this may be from lack of concerted investigation. Members of the S. anginosis group have, at the least, hyaluronidase, deoxyribonuclease, and various proteinases.(24,106) For many of the less virulent streptococci, the inflammatory response to infection probably relates more to the properties of the cell wall breakdown products than to specific enzymes or toxins. Characteristics that enable them to cause disease often relate to their ability to adhere to host tissues, such as tooth enamel, heart valves or prostheses, or to intravascular catheters. Streptococcus mutans, for example, adheres to the pellicle coating the tooth surface by specific protein receptors called antigen I/II; adhesion is further facilitated by the presence of sucrose. Streptococcus mutans also produce extracellular proteases that are capable of breaking down cemental collagens and other host substrates. Caries occur when the secretion of acids demineralizes the enamel and organisms adhere to and invade the tooth surface. Streptococcus mutans also produce mutacins, bacteriocin-like antibiotic peptides, that help protect their ecological niche in dental biofilm.(9,107) Enterococci and S. anginosis group streptococci are frequently found in mixed infections, especially in association with anaerobic bacteria, suggesting that additional factors are required for them to cause disease. Enterococci produce several pheromones that are chemotactic for neutrophils and may contribute to the inflammation associated with infection. Enterococcus faecalis also produces a plasmid-encoded hemolysin. Because enterococci are frequently resistant to common antibiotics, serious enterococcal disease also occurs as superinfection in patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics that may disturb the normal ecology of this usually benign organism.(12)",

They are somewhat less sensitive to vancomycin and cephalosporins, moderately resistant to chloramphenicol, and fairly resistant to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, and tetracycline. Group B strains have shown some tolerance to penicillin, but the clinical significance of such observations is unknown. Tolerance to penicillin has also been suggested as one mechanism by which group A streptococci persist after treatment of pharyngitis. But although there may be a modest increase in efficacy of cephalosporins compared to penicillin, the explanation appears to be the more efficient eradication of the carrier state in patients whose pharyngitis was actually due to viral causes.(109,110) Another mechanism is thought to be the protection of susceptible streptococci by the production of \u03b2-lactamases by other bacteria in the pharynx or tonsils,(111) although this concept has been disputed.(112) Another explanation is that the streptococci penetrate the epithelial cells where they may persist even in the presence of extracellular penicillin.(113) Resistance to erythromycin occurs in about 5% of group A strains in the United States and most other parts of the world. However, local rates from 25 to 50% have been reported in Korea, Italy, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Resistance rates parallel antibiotic use and may be reduced by improving prescribing practices.(114,115)",

Some strains of E. faecalis have also acquired \u03b2-lactamases as a mechanism of resistance.(120) Infections are usually treated with penicillin or ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside, which exert a synergistic effect against the organisms. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), especially E. faecalis, made their appearance in the late 1980s and have been an increasing problem ever since.(57,121) Vancomycin acts by binding to the d-alanine\u2013d-alanine on the end of cell wall muramic acid precursors. Resistance conferred by a plasmid or transposon carrying the vanA or similar gene, allows the organism to generate muramic acid precursors with peptides ending in d-alanine\u2013d-lactate, to which the vancomycin has low affinity. VRE present difficult therapeutic challenges, because there are few alternatives to vancomycin.(12,57) Most VRE are E. faecium, which is sensitive to quinupristin\u2013dalfopristin, but E. faecalis is resistant. Linezolid is effective against both species, but as more linezolid is being used, resistance has started to appear.(58)",

This trend began long before the advent of antibiotics, suggesting a decrease in virulence or an increase in host resistance, or both. In the 1940s penicillin became widely available, and deaths attributed to scarlet fever and puerperal sepsis, the two most common lethal forms of group A streptococcal disease, became a rarity. The number of reported cases of streptococcal sore throat increased during the 1950s and 1960s, probably because of increased physician awareness of its relation to rheumatic fever, greater use of throat cultures, and the availability of antibiotics for treatment and prevention. Since the 1960s only one population-based study of streptococcal sore throat in an industrialized country has been published, a prospective study of 202 Australian families with at least one child in the 3- to 12-year age group.(122) The incidence of culture-positive cases was 13 per 100 child-years and was eight per 100 child-years for serologically confirmed group A streptococcal infection. This was similar to previous studies in suburban populations, but rates were about half that seen in crowded lower socioeconomic settings and lower still that in present day indigenous populations.(122)",

Of approximately 23,000 throat cultures done annually, 18\u201325% were positive for group A streptococci in this relatively stable population. Meanwhile, the number of cases of acute glomerulonephritis declined from nearly 40 in 1967 to an average of one case per year from 1981 to 1988. Confirmed cases of acute rheumatic fever dropped from 20 to 28 per year to a very few from 1975 to 1985 and have continued to be very low. For example in Baltimore, between 1960 and 1964, the incidence of rheumatic fever was 26 per 100,000 among 5- to 19-year olds. By 1980 the rates had fallen to 0.2\u20130.8 per 100,000 nationwide among whites, but with rates several times higher among other ethnic groups. Beginning in the mid-1980s, an increase in new rheumatic fever cases was seen in Utah, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, and other areas. Disease incidence peaked in Utah in 1985 with 18 per 100,000 population age adjusted for 5- to 17-year olds,(3) and rates peaked again in 1998 and have subsequently declined.(123) Of particular interest was the observation that throughout this period incidence rates were essentially unchanged in Hawaii and New Zealand, where the disease is especially prevalent among Polynesian children. The explanation may be the local prevalence of certain rheumatogenic M protein types many of which were characteristically mucoid, whereas in other areas of the United States these have been largely replaced by nonrheumatogenic types.(77,123)",

More recent data have found that prevalence rates of clinically diagnosed rheumatic heart disease have not changed in Cambodia in 2001\u20132002 (220/100,000) and Mozambique in 2005 (230/100,000). However, echocardiographic screening for mitral or aortic regurgitation revealed that 10 times as many children were affected.(124) The major problem in the developing world is establishing and maintaining effective primary and secondary prevention programs.(125) This principle applies as well to developed areas, such as Miami, Florida, where underprivileged inner-city children have attack rates of 15/100,000, compared to 0.7/100,000 for suburban middle-class children.(126)",

However, the rates in various population-based surveys differ depending upon whether disease was defined as toxic shock, necrotizing fasciitis, or all invasive disease. Surveillance in Ontario, Canada, revealed that the incidence of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) increased from 0.08 cases per 100,000 population in 1992 to 0.49 cases per 100,000 population in 1995, with a case-fatality rate of 13%.(128) In the Netherlands, 1994\u20132003, annual incidence of all invasive disease peaked in 1996 (4.0 cases/100,000/year) and was at its lowest in 1999 (2.0 cases/100,000/year).(20) Similar rates were noted from Israel.(129) In the United States 5,400 cases of invasive GAS infection (3.5 cases per 100,000 persons) were identified in 2000\u20132004, with 735 deaths (case-fatality rate, 13.7%). Case-fatality rates for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome were 36 and 24% for necrotizing fasciitis. Rates were highest among elderly persons (9.4 cases per 100,000), infants (5.3 cases per 100,000), and black persons (4.7 cases per 100,000) and were stable over time.(13) Chickenpox has been a major risk factor for invasive disease in children, but cases have declined since the introduction of the varicella vaccine in 1995.(130) Severe invasive infections due to group A, B, C, and G streptococci were reviewed in Denmark from 1999 to 2002. Group A infections occurred at a rate of 2\u20133/100,000 persons/year. Of particular note was that group G infections rose, mainly among the elderly, from 1 to 2/100,000 during the observation period. Septic shock and toxic shock syndromes were seen in group B, C, and G infections, although not as frequently as with group A streptococci.(19)",

In the 1980s attack rates of early-onset disease were about 2 per 1,000 live births in defined populations in Chicago, Illinois, and Birmingham, Alabama.(26,133) Several clinical trials demonstrated the potential for prevention of early-onset disease by selective intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, which led to the first guidelines issued in 1996 by the CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Two selection strategies were used: One (ACOG) relied of identification of clinical risk factors, such as prematurity, maternal fever, and prolonged rupture of amniotic membranes. The other (AAP) was based on screening women for vaginal/rectal colonization by group B streptococcal at 35\u201337 weeks of gestation. Those with colonization and/or risk factors were offered penicillin given intravenously during labor. This resulted in a 65% decrease in early-onset cases to about 0.5 per 1,000 live births from 1993 to 1998, where they remained unchanged through 2001. Meanwhile, further studies in the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance program found that routine antenatal screening prevented significantly more infections than the risk-based strategy.(134) Revised guidelines and updated prophylaxis regimens were published in 2002.(28) Since that time, rates of early-onset disease have declined and additional 31% to 0.34 per 1,000 live births.(14) Rates among African-Americans have seen the largest decline but are still about twice that in the White population. Early-onset disease rates in Europe vary from 0.3 to 2/1,000 live births, and several countries have prevention guidelines.(16) Clinical studies in France and Italy have found similar reductions in attack rates using a combined culture and risk strategy.(135) Experience using a risk-only prevention in the Netherlands has resulted in only modest reductions from 0.54 to 0.36 cases/1,000 live births, and changes in guidelines have been recommended.(136) Early-onset disease rates are about 2/1,000 live births in South Africa and 0.9/1,000 in Malawi, but prevention strategies are difficult to apply in resource-limited settings.(137)",

The major decline in caries has been attributed mainly to fluoridation programs, fluoride-containing dentifrices, and school dental services. By the mid-1980s about half of school-aged children in the United States and Canadian children had permanent teeth completely free of cavities and restorations.(147) Some of these good news and further reductions in DMFT rates to 1/100 surfaces and below can be ascribed to the introduction of tooth sealants, general improvements in dental care, and changes in parental beliefs and attitudes.(148,149)",

By this measure WHO can monitor trends from more than 1,000 surveys submitted to the WHO Global Oral Data Bank, set up in 1970. Some developing countries have seen a rise in DFMT thought to be associated with changes in diet and other factors associated with urbanization.(150) In the absence of fluoridation and adequate dental care, increased sugar consumption may also play a role.(152) Most caries and DMFT data from the developing world now come from regional or national survey or from compilations of published reports.(153)",

After delivery, a previously asymptomatic mother may develop endometritis, usually without bacteremia. Classical puerperal sepsis due to group A streptococci, in contrast, was often transmitted via obstetric personnel and occurred as a fulminant infection after delivery, sparing the infant. With group B streptococci, infected infants are usually exposed in utero to the serotype carried by the mother. Infants with this \u201cearly-onset\u201d form of infection are usually bacteremic at delivery and become symptomatic within a few hours of birth.(26,163) Infection is directly related to the size of the inoculum to which the infant is exposed, by swallowing or aspirating infected amniotic fluid. Most infants are lightly colonized and at little risk for infection, whereas those who are infected are almost invariably heavily colonized at birth. Some infants may acquire organisms via the respiratory tract during transit through the birth canal, or from persons other than the mother, and become symptomatic at a later time. Development of the late-onset form of disease may be delayed for days or weeks, and only about half of these infants will be infected by an organism acquired at birth or from the mother.(26,138)",

Although the rate of carriage of the epidemic types was relatively low, the \u201cinfectivity factor\u201d (measured by the ratio of cases of pneumonia to the number of carriers) was much higher than that of other types commonly carried. Similarly, infants in our prospective study frequently carried one of several common types for prolonged periods, but when they develop otitis media it was usually within 4 weeks of acquiring a type they had not carried previously.(165) This epidemiologic relationship has been nicely confirmed in the Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study.(166)",

Streptococcus mutans has been implicated as a major pathogen in caries, and it appears that most infants acquire S. mutans strains from their mother.(7,107) These observations have been confirmed using molecular methods in a prospective studies of acquisition and infection.(8,107) They further developed evidence for a discrete \u201cwindow of infectivity\u201d between 18 and 30 months of age, coinciding with the emergence of the 20 primary teeth. Children who did not acquire S. mutans during this period were at much lower risk for caries, at least through 6 years of age. To develop stable colonization S. mutans requires nonshedding tooth surfaces over a period of time. Children generally harbor several S. mutans genotypes, with a tendency to form stable colonization by strains transmitted from the mother.(107) Based on epidemiologic evidence from caries prevalence surveys, it is postulated that a second window of infectivity may exist coincident with the emergence of permanent teeth between 6 and 12 years of age.",

In the southeastern states there is both a late fall and a late winter peak of respiratory infection, coinciding with the beginning of school in the fall and with increased indoor activity or crowding during colder months. Seasonal variation is less evident in tropical or subtropical areas, although gathering of children at school or other institutions appears to increase the incidence of disease at certain times of the year.

Such conditions favor the exposure of unprotected skin to the assault of minor trauma and the bites of mosquitoes and other insects.

The group A streptococci are transmitted principally by direct contact. Contagiousness is greatest during acute respiratory infection, whereas the chronic carrier is a relatively low risk as an infectious source. This probably reflects the fact that development of infection requires a fairly large inoculum. About 100 organisms are required to infect adult volunteers by directly inoculating the tonsils and pharynx with organisms on a cotton swab. Although streptococci may occur in droplets and survive in dust, an individual is unlikely to acquire a large enough inoculum to become infected from these sources. Streptococci recovered from contaminated blankets and dust may also be less infective. Direct transmission of respiratory secretions may occur via hands, person-to-person contact such as kissing, or projection of large droplets during coughing or sneezing. Treatment of infected persons eliminates the risk of spread within 24 h, permitting resumption of work or school activities as soon as constitutional symptoms have abated.(181)",

Mosquito bites are an especially common site of inoculation, where organisms are rubbed into the wound during itching. In Trinidad, streptococcal impetigo may be transmitted by flies of the genus Hippelates, which feed on open skin sores. Streptococci from the nasopharynx may be transmitted to skin sites, but it is more common for the skin to be colonized first and the throat later. Classical erysipelas, in contrast, is thought to be transmitted via the respiratory tract, either from the patient or from a caretaker. Erysipelas is occasionally seen following superinfection of chicken pox lesions.",

Organisms may enter the amniotic cavity following rupture of amniotic membranes, but the fetus may become infected with membranes intact. Although rupture of membranes for greater than 12 h is a recognized risk factor for ascending infection, the duration of labor is also important, perhaps because of the entry of organisms via microscopic defects in the membranes. Among twins, who have a higher rate of infection than singletons, it is usually the first twin who is closer to the source of infection and at greater risk. Once the streptococci have entered the amniotic fluid, they proliferate rapidly and are aspirated or swallowed by the fetus. Late-onset infections may have a maternal source in about half of cases, with colonization occurring at delivery.(26,138) Other infants may acquire streptococci later from persons outside the immediate family, presumably via the oral or respiratory route. Late-onset and recurrent infections have also been transmitted by mother\u2019s milk in cases with mastitis, asymptomatic colonization, or banked breast milk.(183)",

The organisms may be actively taken up by pulmonary alveolar cells acting as nonprofessional phagocytes, which are incapable of killing the organisms preventing tissue invasion. Alternatively, the organisms can cross the epithelial barriers by transient openings in the cell junctions.(188) Group B streptococci also have mechanisms to evade the inflammatory responses of the host, including the antiphagocytic properties of the polysaccharide capsules, a C5a inactivating enzyme similar to that of group A streptococci, and the c protein, which binds IgA in a nonimmune fashion. The early manifestations of severe disease depend upon the inflammatory responses mediated by both specific and innate host defense factors. Group B streptococcal surface structures and breakdown products, especially cell wall peptidoglycan, interact directly with macrophages and monocytes promoting release of proinflammatory cytokines. Cell wall activates C3 complement via the alternative pathway, and both peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) interact with components of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) system, which in turn promotes cytokine responses. Tissue damage due to hemolysins and other toxins further the inflammatory response. While the initial inflammatory response is often minimal in infants, despite the presence of bacteria in the lung or other tissue, localized, overexuberant responses in the central nervous system appear to play a major role in disturbing the blood\u2013brain barrier, opening the way to development of meningitis.(92,187)",

The absence of neutralizing antibodies to these toxins is associated with increased risk of severe disease.(189) Superantigens are a family of protein toxins that activate the immune system by binding directly to both the MHC class II molecules of antigen-presenting cells and the V\u03b2 T-cell receptor, causing nonspecific activation of up to 30% of the entire T-cell population. This in turn causes massive release of cytokines, including TNF\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-6. More T and B cells are recruited to the site of infection, resulting in further release of IL-1, TNF\u03b1, and other mediators.

Antigenic mimicry between cell wall carbohydrate moieties and cytokeratin may eventually help explain the occurrence of erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules, rheumatic arthritis, and perhaps streptococcal-associated guttate psoriasis. The diverse manifestations of acute rheumatic fever might be explained in part by the specificity and titer of antibodies cross-reactive with different tissue components. In a similar fashion, acute glomerulonephritis may involve the development of antibodies that cross-react with basement membrane collagen and laminin.(75) The cationic charge of the antigens may also influence their affinity for the glomerular basement membrane and the nature of immune complexes formed. Another feature of nephritogenic streptococci is the presence of a nephritis strain-associated protein.(85) This distinctive low-molecular-weight streptokinase is a plasminogen activator and could induce proliferation of cells, release of inflammatory products, and activate complement, thus contributing to known pathologic features of the disease.",

Fermentable carbohydrates, especially sucrose, favor the adherence of mutans streptococci to the tooth surface by several different mechanisms, including glucan-binding and salivary-binding proteins. Streptococcus mutans, together with Streptococcus sobrinis, lactobacilli, and other bacteria form biofilms on the tooth surface. The biofilms have an extracellular water-insoluble carbohydrate matrix which helps stabilize and protect the bacterial colonies and concentrate acids from fermentation, which in turn lower the pH, and aid in demineralization of tooth enamel. This process is countered by the host by the buffering capacity of saliva and defensive components, such as lysozyme, lactoferrin, and secretory IgA. Specific antibodies to S. mutans surface proteins can inhibit sucrose-dependent adherence and interfere with biofilm formation.(107,184)",

Antibody assays for various streptococcal antigens have been noted in Section 3.4.2, and current developments in streptococcal vaccines are further discussed in Section 9.6. Although most of our knowledge of the immune response relates to the occurrence of antibodies in the serum, recent studies of mucosal immunity suggest that the first line of host defenses are at the local level. The precise role of secretory antibodies in preventing, modifying, or eradicating bacterial colonization is not presently understood. Conversely, the effects of bacterial antigens at respiratory and gastrointestinal sites are poorly understood in regard to the systemic antibody response and the development of autoantibodies. In some cases it is likely that the organisms have developed a form of mimicry to confuse or evade the immune response of the host. Many streptococci have antigens that cross-react with other organisms, common foodstuffs, or components of the host\u2019s own tissue. Antibodies undoubtedly have functions other than protection against disease. They are known to be important in the recovery from established infection and probably function in the removal of antigens from local and systemic sites.",

These antibodies, however, are not as efficient as secretory IgA antibodies in protecting mice against infection via the intranasal route. Intranasal immunization of volunteers with purified M protein resulted in greater resistance to colonization with live streptococci than did subcutaneous immunization, and serum antibody response was not a reliable predictor of resistance to pharyngitis. At present, group A vaccines remain experimental, but it appears that local immune mechanisms may be more efficiently utilized and less likely to result in systemic side effects.",

Protective levels of IgG seem to vary with serotype, and protection increases as fetuses receive more maternal IgG at > 34 weeks gestation. In a prospective study of infection levels have been empirically estimated to be \u22655 \u03bcg/ml for type Ia and \u226510 \u03bcg/ml for type III.(192,193) Despite the presumed importance of antibodies, it should be pointed out that the prevalence of group B streptococcal antibodies among pregnant women is generally low, with only 7\u201323% sera having >2 \u03bcg/ml against types Ia, Ib, II, III, and V in a defined population.(194) Thus, the majority of infants are \u201cantibody deficient,\u201d whether colonized or not, yet only a small number develop disease, even when exposed to infected amniotic fluid in utero.(195) The presence of mucosal antibodies may modify colonization, but so far a clearly defined role for secretory immunity is not apparent.",

Acute glomerulonephritis presents fewer diagnostic problems. A recent skin or throat infection is usually evident by examination, history, culture, or antibody tests.

Infection usually takes the form of undifferentiated sepsis with, or more often without, meningitis. The disease is well advanced by the time hypoxia, cyanosis, acidosis, or vascular collapse becomes obvious. Lung involvement is frequent but the chest X-ray is typical of hyaline membrane disease more often than of discrete pneumonia. Similarly, there may be little or no CSF pleocytosis even when bacteria are recovered from the spinal fluid. In general, the inflammatory response parallels the maturity of the infant, the specificity of clinical signs and symptoms, and to some extent the prognosis. Late-onset infections, occurring beyond the immediate newborn period, often tend to be more localized and have a better outcome. Meningitis is common, but sepsis without meningitis is frequently seen. Bacteremia or meningitis may be associated with an infective focus, such as omphalitis, otitis media, or osteomyelitis. The long-term outcome of infants who survive group B streptococcal meningitis is generally good. Very occasionally, neonates develop similar disease due to group G streptococci or pneumococci. Maternal group B streptococcal disease may occur during gestation, notably urinary tract infections and septic abortion. Infection around the time of delivery, especially amnionitis, is a threat to both fetus and mother. Endometritis and bacteremia are the most frequent postpartum infections. Endocarditis is an unusual complication of perinatal infection or septic abortion.(162)",

Erythromycin is a well-established alternative drug for penicillin-allergic patients, except in some areas where resistance may be a problem.

Long-acting intramuscular benzathine penicillin is usually given at intervals of 2\u20134 weeks, depending on local prevalence of rheumatic fever. Although dosing every 3 weeks may not provide adequate penicillin levels through the third week, this regime appears to be adequate in most situations and is often recommended.(205,206) Alternatively, oral penicillin may be given daily, but lack of compliance is a major problem. Patients unable to take penicillin may be given sulfadiazine or erythromycin. The duration of secondary prophylaxis is not certain but must be tailored to the individual. Patients with valvular rheumatic heart disease are given prolonged, even lifelong, prophylaxis. Those without cardiac involvement should have prophylaxis for at least 5 years and at least through age 18. Prophylaxis may be safely discontinued in young adults without carditis, provided that they have adequate medical follow-up and prompt culture and treatment of pharyngitis episodes.(207) Patients with rheumatic carditis as part of their initial attack are at greater risk for more serious carditis recurrences and should be given prophylaxis well into adulthood and perhaps for life.",

These include patients with prosthetic heart valves, patients with a prior history of endocarditis, and those with unrepaired congenital heart disease and those with residual defects, prosthetic materials or devices that inhibit endothelialization. It has been concluded that bacteremia resulting from daily activities is much more likely to cause endocarditis than bacteremia associated with dental procedures.

Scientific data demonstrating the efficacy of prophylaxis is lacking, except for conditions associated with highest risks for adverse outcomes.",

The original 1996 guidelines, a compromise that used either maternal culture screening or maternal risk factors, resulted in a 65% decrease in early-onset cases. Subsequent population-based surveillance of the two different approaches found that culture-based programs were at least 50% more effective than risk-based programs.(134) This prompted a revision of the guidelines in 2002 by the CDC in cooperation with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).(28) The new guidelines, outlined in Figure 4, is based on results of combined vaginal and rectal culture performed on women at 35\u201337 weeks of gestation. Further surveillance during 2002\u20132004 has confirmed that the rates of early-onset disease have declined an additional 31% since implementation of the new guidelines.(14) Several European countries and Australia have instituted similar guidelines, and Dutch investigators have recommended a shift from risk-based to screening-based programs.(136)\n\n",

There is, however, some increased frequency of resistance to clindamycin, which is used as an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients.(27) Resistance to ampicillin among nontarget organisms, such as Escherichia coli, parallels rates in other community-acquired infections and does not appear to be related directly to intrapartum prophylaxis.

As reviewed by Bisno et al., current research involves two broad categories of vaccines: those based on type-specific M protein components and others containing virulence determinants that are common to all or many serotypes.(220) The M protein molecule is a coiled coil with three main antigenic regions: a nonhelical amino-terminus conferring type specificity and susceptible to antibody; the second area consists of B repeat subunits that cross-react with human tissue components; a third C repeat region has epitopes common to many M proteins; finally, the carboxy terminus ends with a cell wall spanning anchor region.(73) A multivalent recombinant M-type vaccine has now been constructed using the amino-terminal peptides of 26 of the clinically most important M types.(221) This vaccine has been tested for safety and immunogenicity in humans, and it elicits opsonizing antibodies to the respective M types. The vaccine does not contain any tissue cross-reactiveM epitopes from the B repeat area of the M protein and thus should not be able to provoke autoimmune-like responses. Other approaches to vaccines are promising but have not yet been studied in humans. A vaccine that contains epitopes of the carboxy-terminal C repeat area of the M protein cross-reacts with most of the common M types but also avoids the tissue-reactive B repeat area.(222) Another vaccine uses a lipid core as a carrier for the C repeat peptide, which has the advantage of not requiring a vaccine adjuvant.(223) A vaccine against the group A carbohydrate is enhanced by conjugation to tetanus toxoid to produce antibodies presumably protective against all strains.(76) A vaccine against the fibronectin-binding protein (FB54) targets a surface protein strongly associated with virulence.(224) Vaccines against the C5a peptidase of either group A or group B streptococci might not be directly protective but could reduce the effects of the more serious invasive infections.(225)",

Vaccines are projected to offer broader more cost-effective protection.(227) The goal of the vaccine approach is to immunize women in order to induce antibody that will later be capable of protecting the fetus against early-onset disease and perhaps afford protection for several months against late-onset disease. Ideally, a vaccine should induce antibodies of the IgG class to cross the placenta and be effective against all of the major serotypes. The first purified polysaccharide vaccine, against type III, was only modestly immunogenic. The immunogenicity was significantly improved by conjugation to tetanus toxoid, as was so successful with Hemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal vaccines. Phase I and phase 2 clinical trials have been successfully conducted with individual conjugates of types Ia, Ib, II, III, and V, and preclinical testing has been done with several multivalent vaccines.(226) Several surface proteins of known association with virulence are also being considered. These include several proteins common to nearly all strains, such as alpha, Sip, Rib, and the C5a peptidase, and the c protein, which occurs mainly with type Ia and Ib strains.(44,228) Assuming the eventual development of an appropriate vaccine, it will still be necessary to carefully define the target population. There is yet little enthusiasm for administering vaccines to pregnant women, mainly because of safety and liability issues.(229) It is possible that the target population would have to focus on or include nonpregnant women of childbearing age. The prospects for protecting the more premature fetus is uncertain, since only a minimal amount of maternally derived antibody is able to cross the placenta before the last trimester.(193) Nevertheless, it would be reasonable to suggest that any degree of protection afforded the mother would indirectly affect the fetus.",

About two-thirds of the US population receive fluoridated water, compared to 40% in Canada, 10% in the United Kingdom and in Spain. France does not fluoridate, and Switzerland has replaced fluoridation with fluoride in domestic salt. Fluoride mouthwashes are probably of marginal value in communities with fluoridated water. They are not intended for children under 5 years of age, who may ingest excessive amounts and be in danger of fluorosis. Professional application of topical fluoride may be helpful for high-risk individuals and patients with active caries but is not currently recommended for routine use because of the overall decline in caries incidence.",

The distinction between infection and carrier state is frequently blurred. The new rapid diagnostic tests make it possible to treat promptly and reduce clinical symptoms, but it is unlikely that changes in clinical practice have influenced the recent resurgence of acute rheumatic fever or of severe invasive streptococcal disease and toxic shock. Further study of epidemiologic factors, pathogenic mechanisms, and host response is clearly needed. Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis and its less certain relationship with cardiac sequelae continues to present a clinical dilemma for clinicians.(208) Group A streptococci, along with staphylococci, have been suggested as an etiology for Kawasaki disease, a vasculitis syndrome that occurs mainly in children. It is hypothesized that staphylococcal toxin TSST-1 or streptococcal exotoxins act as superantigens and cause aberrant amplification of certain T-cell lines implicated in the disease process.(233)",

The reasons for this are not clear but could be of considerable practical importance. Methods for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis have been established but remain to be implemented on a wide scale. Meanwhile, we still have little understanding of the local and systemic defense mechanisms required to prevent infection by this usually benign organism. Other streptococci, particularly oral and enteric species, are constant companions that cause disease only under specialized circumstances. It is not clear whether some of these organisms are in fact \u201cvirulent\u201d in certain settings, or whether the disease is due mainly to predisposing conditions in the host.

In addition, major virulence factors, such as exotoxins, enzymes, M proteins and polysaccharide capsules, have been identified, but the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which they interact with the host remain uncertain and do not completely explain the disease processes. The determinants of colonization, the defenses of the host at the mucosal level, and the development of local and systemic immunity are not well understood.
