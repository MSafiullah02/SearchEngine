            "text": "Frameshifting during translation of viral or in rare cases cellular mRNA results in the synthesis of proteins from two overlapping reading frames within the same mRNA. In HIV-1 the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase enzymes are in a second reading frame relative to the structural group-specific antigen (gag), and their synthesis is dependent upon frameshifting. This ensures that a strictly regulated ratio of structural proteins and enzymes, which is critical for HIV-1 replication and viral infectivity, is maintained during protein synthesis. The frameshift element in HIV-1 RNA is an attractive target for the development of a new class of anti HIV-1 drugs. However, a number of examples are now emerging of human genes using \u22121 frameshifting, such as PEG10 and CCR5. In this study we have compared the HIV-1 and PEG10 frameshift elements and shown they have distinct functional characteristics. Frameshifting occurs at several points within each element. Moreover, frameshift modulators that were isolated by high-throughput screening of a library of 114,000 lead-like compounds behaved differently with the PEG10 frameshift element. The most effective compounds affecting the HIV-1 element enhanced frameshifting by 2.5-fold at 10 \u03bcM in two different frameshift reporter assay systems. HIV-1 protease:gag protein ratio was affected by a similar amount in a specific assay of virally-infected cultured cell, but the modulation of frameshifting of the firstiteration compounds was not sufficient to show significant effects on viral infectivity. Importantly, two compounds did not affect frameshifting with the human PEG10 element, while one modestly inhibited rather than enhanced frameshifting at the human element. These studies indicate that frameshift elements have unique characteristics that may allow targeting of HIV-1 and of other viruses specifically for development of antiviral therapeutic molecules without effect on human genes like PEG10 that use the same generic mechanism.",

In developing countries it remains a persistent threat to populations not able to access expensive drugs and, in particular, the virus continues to cause devastation in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe.",

In HIV, two major genes, gag and pol overlap by 205 nucleotides [7] . The downstream pol gene that encodes the protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase within a single polypeptide does not have its own initiation codon and is in a different reading frame (\u22121) relative to gag. A change in the reading frame (or frameshift) is required for the encoded information for these proteins to be translated. This leads to a gag-pol fusion polyprotein being synthesized dependent upon a \u22121 frameshifting event. Efficient programmed translational frameshifting requires two elements within the mRNA: a highly conserved slippery sequence (U UUU UUA) [8] , and a downstream RNA stem-loop that enhances the efficiency of \u22121 frameshifting [7] .",

Indeed the human developmental gene PEG10 (paternally expressed gene 10) undergoes \u22121 frameshifting [14] . Important for placental development [15] , PEG10 is expressed 10 days post-conception in mouse placenta and amniotic membranes. Synthesis of the protein has not been found in adult tissues [14] but preliminary evidence has been obtained that the protein is also expressed in the hypothalamus [16] , and the adrenal glands [17] . However, as yet we have no definitive evidence for frameshifting [16] . Another poorly characterized family of 15 human genes, MA/Pnma, has been determined to have retroelement ancestry, and two members have the potential for frameshifting, Ma3 and Ma5. The Ma3 frameshift element has been shown to support 20% frameshifting in vitro [18] but to date no evidence has been presented for its occurrence in vivo, or what function it might be supporting. Also more recently, the chemokine receptor CCR5 has been identified as a human gene that utilizes \u22121 frameshifting for fine tuning the regulation of its expression [19] . The new reading frame leads to a premature stop codon, initiating nonsense-mediated decay for destabilization of the mRNA. CCR5 frameshifting is stimulated by endogenous microRNAs, emphasizing the importance of screening in cells in vivo where endogenous modulators are functioning.",

To identify compounds that modulate HIV frameshifting, several large screens have previously been undertaken. For example, a screen of 56,000 compounds by Ribogene Inc. identified a compound RG501 (also known as DB213) that enhanced frameshifting leading to a 50% decrease in viral replication in vitro, although this compound was not a suitable candidate for use as a therapeutic agent [20] .

In the case of the PEG10 element, sequences included the slippery sequence and the pseudoknot as predicted by Manktelow et al 2005 [31] , together with sequence encoding the His tag in the -1-frame followed by a stop codon. Translation products contained the amino acids of the MalE gene and the amino acids encoded by the PEG10 frameshift element; 43.9 kD where the translation continues in the 0-frame until a stop codon is reached, or 46.4 kD where frameshifting has occurred terminating after the His tag.",

The hits identified from the screen were then confirmed utilizing a series of counter screens. A control construct, with the same reporter genes in-frame, and a modified element that eliminated frameshifting at the site, was used as a counter screen to eliminate those compounds that acted off-target, for example, by modulating the signal of the downstream Luc + reporter. A second counter screen used a construct with a sequence element containing a known nonsense mutation of the cystic fibrosis chloride channel gene CFTR. This element was cloned between the same reporter genes to indicate whether inhibitory or stimulatory compounds were specific for the frameshift element or affected readthrough of nonsense mutations as well. We also tested effects on a purified Luc + enzyme for a counter screen. An orthologous cell-based assay with fluorescent reporters was used to ensure effects of promising compounds were not related to the specific luciferase reporter assay. Finally we tested the effects of the most promising compounds on the frameshift efficiency of the human PEG10 frameshift element, to determine their specificity for HIV-1.",

Firstly the compounds were tested for toxicity for the host H9 cells at increasing concentrations and at the three time points (24, 48 and 72 h) that were used for the HIV-1 infection experiments, comparing with untreated cells, or those treated with AZT as a control. For two compounds, A1 and A3, the results were within the normal variability expected and there was no significant cytotoxicity, whereas the other compound A2 showed >25% toxicity at the highest concentration and so was put aside for this study. Then H9 cells were either infected with HIV-1 IIIB or uninfected as a control, and treated with enhancer compounds A1 and A3 (at 1, 5 and 20 \u03bcM) and a DMSO vehicle solvent control (0 \u03bcM) and cells were harvested at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h for analysis by Western immunoblot of gag protein (P24) expressed in the 0-frame, with specific antibody followed by the appropriate secondary antibody/detection reagent.

For the comparison of the mechanisms operating at each site, we used transient transfection assays [26] . As shown in Fig  1A the HIV-1 and PEG10 frameshift elements have unique features within a common structural background. Both have (i) slippery sequences (SS) of the form X XXY YYZ (U UUU UUA for HIV-1 and G GGA AAC for PEG10), (ii) different intercodons [26] (GGG and UCC respectively), (iii) distinct secondary structures (SStr) (extended stem-loop for HIV-1 and pseudoknot for PEG10), and (iv) the SStr start is within the intercodon in HIV-1, whereas it is two nucleotides downstream of the intercodon in PEG10. Perhaps with these differences it is not surprising that the frameshift efficiencies of the two elements are so different, as shown in Fig 1B ( 10% for HIV-1 and 22% for PEG10). In both cases, when the slippery sequences are modified to eliminate their homopolymeric nature, frameshifting is very low. If the highly conserved intercodon [26] is substituted with a stop codon frameshifting is dramatically reduced with both elements. For HIV-1, the efficiency can be further reduced by overexpressing the stop codon decoding molecule, eRF1 [26] . By contrast, overexpressing eRF1 had no further effect on frameshift efficiency with the PEG10 element ( Fig 1C) . The constructs and assays utilized in these studies are as previously described [16, 26] .",

The frameshift elements were cloned behind a bacterial MalE gene and were followed by a His tag in the \u22121-frame. HIV-1 frameshifting has been shown to have the same characteristics on eukaryotic and bacterial ribosomes [26, 35] . After expression of the constructs in Escherichia coli the expression products were isolated on amylose columns via binding of the maltose binding protein, and the frameshift products were then purified on Co 2+ columns utilizing the \u22121-frame His tag. These products were subjected to mass spectrometry (MS)-based peptide identification (Table 1 ). In the case of HIV-1 four distinct peptides were identified, one a trypsin cleavage product of a larger peptide. Of particular interest, one such position contained the 0-frame glycine encoded by the intercodon, GGG. This peptide sequence implied decoding and frameshifting had occurred after GGG had been decoded, and explained why the overexpressed decoding molecule eRF1 as shown in Fig 1C had lowered further the frameshift efficiency when the GGG was substituted by a stop codon. For PEG10 translation a contrasting result was obtained-three peptides were identified (one a fragment of a larger peptide Table 1 ). Their identities indicated frameshifting had occurred predominantly before the intercodon was encountered. There was however, evidence of a low abundance peptide that included the amino acid encoded in the UCC intercodon (Table 1) . From the identification of these peptides the sites of frameshifting were deduced for each element and, in the case of PEG10, the minor site is indicated with a dotted arrow (Fig 2) . The low level of the peptide arising from this event was consistent with a failure to detect significant modulation of PEG10 frameshifting by decoding molecules with substitution of the intercodon by a stop codon ( Fig 1C) . As shown in Fig  1B, paradoxically this substitution alone still reduced frameshifting at the site specifically and substantially. This might result simply from peptidyl-tRNA fall-off as the ribosome is stalled or slowed at the site or as frameshifting is occurring since there is only one cognate re-pairing possible after slippage at the PEG10 site in contrast to the two cognate re-pairings at the HIV-1 site. Such a fall-off would lower the production of the downstream reporter. Black bars are constructs with empty vector, and grey bars with~3 fold overexpression of eRF1. Constructs were as described in [26] for HIV-1, and in [16] for PEG10. Assays were carried out as described in [16] .",

The dashed line in the PEG10 element indicates the detection of the predicted minor site of frameshifting following high resolution/accurate mass measurement of the respective tryptic peptide with a mass error of less than 1 ppm (0.0016 Da). using the dual luciferase reporters (Renilla/firefly) and dual fluorescent reporters (GFP/tdTomato) created with Gateway 1 (Invitrogen) cloning cassettes. This enabled the cloning of the HIV-1 frameshift element, and expression of the downstream reporter indicated a frameshift rate within the expected range of 5\u221210% with slight variation depending on the reporters used [27, 36] . Two HIV frameshift elements were constructed, the wild-type slippery sequence, U UUU UUA, followed by GGG and the extended stem-loop [28] , and a variant U UUC CUA that does not support frameshifting. For an additional control (0-frame), an A was inserted immediately 3 0 of the modified SS (ie U UUC CUA A), placing the downstream reporter in the 0-frame with respect to the upstream reporter. The cell lines expressing this sequence were used in counter screens to determine any off-target activity of the compounds being evaluated. The reporter constructs also contained a FlpIn\u2122 (Invitrogen) integration site ensuring the reporter genes were stably integrated into the same genomic location so as to produce isogenic mammalian cell lines. We elected to use a stepwise screening approach where we first screened 114,000 compounds at 10 \u03bcM from the curated WEHI library. The WEHI library consisted of diverse \"leadlike\" small molecules that possess synthetically amenable structures, are of high diversity as per Tanimoto dissimilarity analysis (T 0.85), and are Lipinski compliant. The library had been filtered stringently to exclude any undesirable, reactive, promiscuous and assay-interfering compounds [25] . Luciferase reporters were used for the primary screen because of their high level of sensitivity that enabled frameshifting to be detected in stably transfected cells seeded in 384 well plates. The optimized 384 well assay using the Dual-Glo 1 Luciferase Assay System (Promega) enabled a high-throughput assay to be developed with a strong signal, with a background ratio of 10 and a Z\u00b4-factor of >0.5, indicating a robust platform for screening [30] .",

Frameshift enhancers like compound A1 showed increases in frameshifting with no apparent change in canonical protein synthesis up to 10 \u03bcM, as indicated by the upstream reporter (hRLuc) expression when the cells were assayed at 24 h after compound addition (Fig 3A green) . The downstream reporter was not affected by these compounds when it was in the same frame as the upstream reporter (translation ratio 1.0) (Fig 3A  red) . This was reinforced separately by showing enhancer A1 did not modulate recombinant Luc + enzyme activity. To ensure specificity for frameshifting, assays were employed to measure effects of the selected compounds on a different type of a genetic recoding site, the common UGA nonsense mutation W1282X found in the cystic fibrosis gene, CTFR [29] . As shown in Fig 3B enhancer A1 did not affect this different recoding event, either the readthrough of the UGA stop codon (green), or a UGG sense codon control at that site (red). As a positive control PTC124, the putative stop-codon readthrough enhancer, that is now known also to bind to and inhibit Luc + enzymatic activity, was tested. The expected inhibition of Luc + with increasing concentration of PTC124 [37] is reflected in Fig 3C (red) where there is an apparent decrease in the translation ratio of the sense codon control. This was confirmed directly by showing PTC124 decreased recombinant Luc + activity. However, PTC124 enhanced readthrough of the UGA stop codon as expected when normalized against this sense codon control as shown in Fig 3C (green) and this effect was also dependent upon concentration. Collectively these data implied the enhancer A1 was a specific modulator of -1 frameshifting and did not affect the reporter enzymes or simply modulate ribosomal activity more generally.",

No significant effects were detected in this assay with the compounds found to enhance or inhibit frameshifting in the screen by~2-fold at 20 \u03bcM. This was not surprising as the~2-fold fold change in frameshift efficiency was likely below the limit of change required to inhibit infectivity [13] . Improvement of these compounds is ongoing. To determine whether the same pattern and degree of modulation that had been obtained in the screening programme could be reproduced with HIV-1 proteins in the 0-and -1-frames, we tested the most promising enhancers in HIV-1 infected H9 cells. Following toxicity screens the effects on synthesis of the viral protease encoded in the \u22121-frame compared with the 0-frame gag structural protein were determined at three time points and three concentrations of the compounds. With each compound from 1\u221220 \u03bcM there was an increasing concentrationdependent enhancement of viral protease compared to gag protein (1.5\u22122.2 fold at 20 \u03bcM) compared with solvent control (Fig 5) . This was the same pattern and degree of enhancement that had been seen with the cellular screening assay and it reinforced the specificity of the enhancers for modulating -1 frameshifting within the HIV-1 element. We used both a dual luciferease reporter system and a bifluorescence reporter system to test out whether the human PEG10 frameshift element behaved differently to the HIV-1 element with the isolated enhancers. For the second reporter system, the elements and their variants were cloned between the EGFP and tdTomato bifluorescence reporters and cells transfected for transient expression (Fig 6) . They are compared with the dual luciferase reporters also containing either of the two elements (Fig 6; HIV-1 above and PEG10 below). Each compound enhanced frameshifting of the HIV-1 element in both the bifluorescent and luciferase assays and to a similar extent in each reporter system (Fig 6 upper panel) . In contrast to the results with the HIV-1 element, frameshifting at the PEG10 frameshift site was affected by only one of the compounds, A1, and was inhibited rather than enhanced with both reporter systems (Fig 6,  lower panels) . A2 showed a suggestion of inhibition but it was very small while A3 had no effect. This confirmed that unique features of different frameshift elements might make each of them amenable to modulation differentially by specific compounds.",

            "text": "Modulators of the HIV-1 frameshift efficiency have the potential to be specific for the HIV-1 frameshift element because of structurally unique features that distinguish it from the now well HIV-1 and PEG10 Frameshift Elements documented frameshift elements of two human genes, PEG10 [16] and CCR5 [19] . These two human genes have themselves quite different frameshift elements with different functional consequences. Frameshifting has been identified in vivo after extensive studies with PEG10 [14, 16] . The different slippery sequences, intercodons, and downstream secondary structures facilitated a frameshift efficiency that was~2.5-fold higher for PEG10 than for HIV-1 (Fig 1) . This is despite the fact that after \u22121 slippage the HIV-1 sequence can make two cognate codon/ anticodon pairings [39] whereas slippage allows for only one cognate re-pairing in the PEG10 gene. The intercodon is highly conserved in HIV-1 [26] , but substitution with a stop codon had a greater effect in PEG10 decreasing frameshifting 4-5-fold compared with 2-3-fold in HIV-1. With the HIV-1 element this can be further reduced by overexpressing the decoding molecule eRF1 and this can be explained as we identified frameshifting can occur at a site within the sequence element after the intercodon has been decoded (Fig 2) . Hence with the substituted intercodon the 0-frame UGA would be decoded before frameshifting. By contrast PEG10 was insensitive to overexpession of eRF1, and it was shown to frameshift predominantly at two sites only in our heterologous system, both before the intercodon. There was however, suggestive evidence of a low frequency event after decoding of the intercodon (Table 1) . Frameshifting at multiple sites with a frameshift element has recently been reported in the dnaX gene, and drop-off of incomplete polypeptides is inferred to occur from fidelity checks when the base pairing is non-cognate [40] . Such an outcome could contribute significantly to the large reduction in the output of the downstream reporter in the \u22121-frame in our PEG10 study when the UCC intercodon is substituted with UGA. Having only one rather than two cognate re-pairings on frameshifting might destabilize the complex, allowing a significant amount of drop-off and thereby reduced frameshift efficiency. H9 cells, either infected with HIV-1 IIIB or uninfected as a control, were treated with enhancer compounds A1 and A3 (at 1, 5 and 20 \u03bcM) and a DMSO solvent control and cells were harvested at 48 h for analysis of protein expressed in the 0-frame, followed by the appropriate secondary antibody/ detection reagent. The filter was then stripped and re-probed with anti-GAPDH for lane-to-lane normalization (A). On a separate gel the protease enzyme (\u22121-frame) was detected using an anti-protease antibody together with secondary antibody. The filter was stripped and re-probed as before with anti-GAPDH for lane-to-lane normalization (B). The intensity of the developed bands was quantitated (C), and the frameshift efficiency calculated for each compound at each concentration and for the DMSO control. These were normalized to the GAPDH intensities, and compared with the DMSO control. Can compounds be isolated that modulate frameshift efficiency in HIV-1 but not in human gene PEG10? Using specific purpose-based cell-based assays, in this study we have screened a large small molecule library that included compounds that are desirable starting points for further lead development. Several frameshift enhancers showed no activity against the 0-frame control element or in counter screens. A primary isolate from the screen and two analogues were tested also with bifluorescent reporters (Fig 6) , and they mimicked the enhancement of frameshifting seen in the luciferase assays within the HIV-1 element (Fig 3A) indicating the observed activity was independent of the reporter set. These compounds also had no effect on readthrough of a nonsense codon at a different recoding site, the CFTR W1282X UGA nonsense mutation context, found in patients with cystic fibrosis (Fig 3B) . The isolated enhancers in their current configuration did not give sufficient frameshift modulation to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity significantly in cell viability assays, but the synthesis of the protease enzyme in the \u22121-frame was enhanced~2-fold by these compounds in HIV-1 infected cells relative to the 0-frame gag protein. While the minimum increase in frameshift ratio needed to inhibit infectivity is not known precisely, collective studies suggest it might be at least in the order of 3-fold. Hence further chemical modifications to the isolated compounds are needed to facilitate improvement in their efficacy and potency. While programmed \u22121 translational frameshifting is a rare recoding event used mainly by viruses it has yet to be exploited as a therapeutic target. Now human genes are emerging that use the same generic mechanism. PEG10 protein expression with frameshifting has been documented only in placenta, in amniotic membranes and at low levels in embryos, and not observed in other tissues despite extensive analysis [14, 16] . Here, we tested our isolated enhancer compounds on the PEG10 element. Two of the compounds A2 and A3 (Fig 6) that enhanced frameshifting with the HIV-1 element had no or little effect on PEG10 frameshifting. The other enhancer, A1, modestly inhibited PEG10 frameshifting in a concentration-dependent manner. This illustrates discovery of compounds specific for HIV-1 should be possible. Some frameshift modulators, depending on their mode of action might affect all frameshift sites however, and comprehensive testing of all human -1 frameshift sites is therefore important. The direct mechanism of action of the promising compounds we have identified is now being determined. Since they differentiate the HIV-1 and PEG10 elements that have quite different secondary structural components (stem-loop and pseudoknot) we predict they would likely target this part of the element. Nevertheless modulating compounds could target the coding RNA at the slippery sequence, or the secondary structural element, or indeed the active center of the host human translating ribosome that has a major function of maintaining the reading frame. The sites of interaction of the A1, A2 and A3 compounds with the HIV-1 frameshift element are currently being investigated.",
