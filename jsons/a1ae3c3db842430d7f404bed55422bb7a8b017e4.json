Diagnosis relies upon fulfi lling clinical criteria and laboratory assessments including serum ferritin, soluble IL-2 receptor levels, and natural killer (NK) cell function studies. Treatment consists of excellent supportive care for the critically ill. Specifi c disease modifying therapy employs immunosuppressant medications and often hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

It is caused by many disparate, but related etiologies, rather than as a single, discrete, unifi ed disease process. In this regard and others, HLH bears resemblance to sepsis, which also has a multitude of pathologic processes at its root. Indeed, HLH may often be mistaken for culture negative sepsis.",

Primary HLH is caused by defi ned genetic mutations in genes whose protein products participate in immunologic regulatory pathways. These diseases often present with classic familial inheritance patterns. Secondary HLH is believed to occur sporadically, induced by specifi c infectious or infl ammatory insults. However, as more is discovered about the immune mechanisms involved, the distinction between these subsets is blurring. It may be that many individuals with presumed secondary HLH have subtle defects of immune regulation that predispose to disease activation by specifi c immunologic challenges. HLH was fi rst described by Farquhar and Claireux in 1952. They named the condition \"familial haemophagocytic reticulosis,\" [ 1 ] but through the years it has also been called familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, [ 2 ] viral-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, [ 3 ] and malignancy associated hemophagocytic syndrome [ 4 ] . It is believed by many that the macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), observed in association with rheumatologic disorders, is likely a variant of HLH as both have similar clinical phenotypes and share some underlying mechanisms [ 5 -11 ] . The International Histiocyte Society formally adopted the name of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in 1998 and defi ned criteria for its diagnosis which were updated in 2007 (Table 26 .1 ) [ 4 , 12 , 13 ] .",

Currently, it is estimated that the autosomal recessive forms of familial HLH have a prevalence of 1/50,000 live births.

It is this underlying infl ammation that drives the clinical features and contributes to the multisystem organ failure observed in this disorder. Histiocytes are phagocytic antigen presenting cells derived from the bone marrow mononuclear myeloid/granulocyte progenitor lineage. Monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells are considered histiocytes. In the normal immune response to infection or tissue injury, these cells function to activate and direct the innate and subsequent adaptive responses through cytokine/chemokine signaling and antigen presentation to their lymphoid counterparts. B cells, as well as helper and effector T cells, contribute to the infl ammatory milieu through their own cytokine elaboration. They also assist with pathogen elimination via antibody production, activation of phagocytic killing, and by direct assassination of infected cells. Beyond coordinating the specifi c activities of various immune cells, cytokines exert systemic effects on various organs to initiate a stress response designed to protect tissue integrity and function, mobilize metabolic substrate necessary for the increased immunologic demand, and to establish an environment conducive to pathogen eradication. Natural killer (NK) cells are crucial to all aspects of this process. They help coordinate the initiation, effector, and resolution phases of the immune response by modulating initial histiocyte signaling, eradicating infected/damaged cells, and by ultimately culling the expanded effector lymphocyte and histiocyte population. They accomplish these effects through their own cytokine signaling and by utilizing granule-mediated activation-induced apoptosis.",

This process begins as the effector T cell or the NK cell 'surveys' the target cells by sampling their surface proteins and receptor repertoire. Inappropriate epitopes displayed within major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules or abnormal surface protein patterns activate the effector cell and induce the formation of a circular immunologic synapse. This circular immunologic synapse is created with tight junctions fashioned at the periphery by interactions between effector cell lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1) and target cell intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) proteins. The effector intracellular cytoskeletal scaffold microtubule organizing center (MTOC) is oriented toward the synapse, reorganizing and directing the intracellular secretory apparatus, to direct specialized membrane bound vesicles at the target cell. These vesicles, which contain cytotoxic granules, are transported down the microtubule fi bers, fuse with the plasma membrane, and exocytose their contents into the immunologic synapse. The granules contain several cytotoxic constituents most notably perforin and granzyme proteins. The tight junctions bounding the synapse prevent diffusion of these toxic substances away from the target cell. Perforin inserts itself into the target cell plasma membrane and facilitates the internalization of the various granzyme proteins. The granzyme proteins then trigger target cell The diagnosis of HLH can be established by fulfi lling either or both of the two criteria below 1. A molecular diagnosis consisted with HLH 2.

Mutations in the perforin gene were the fi rst to be directly associated with HLH [ 22 ] . Without perforin, the granzyme enzymes cannot enter target cells to initiate apoptotic cascades. Perforin mutations account for 15-20 % of HLH in certain geographic areas. HLH secondary to mutations in the perforin gene is known as familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 2 (FHL2). FHL2 has both mild and severe phenotypes; the severity inversely correlating with the amount of mature perforin protein that is produced [ 23 , 24 ] . MUNC 13-4, a protein essential to the exocytotic process whereby cytotoxic granules are released by effector cells, is mutated in FHL3 [ 25 ] . FHL3 has a worldwide distribution and accounts for 15-20 % of all inherited forms of HLH. FHL4 is caused by mutations in the protein syntaxin 11, a member of the SNARE family of proteins, which is necessary for the fusion of cytotoxic vesicles with the plasma membrane and release of their granules [ 26 -28 ] . A mutation in the syntaxin binding protein 2, also related to NK cell degranulation, has been initially [ 29 ] . The genetic defect responsible for FHL1 has not been identifi ed and no mutations in granzyme proteins have been associated with HLH. An X-linked variant of familial HLH has recently been described that is associated with XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) defi ciency [ 30 ] . The exact pathologic mechanism has not been elucidated, but it may be related to accentuated T cell receptormediated T cell survival during an immune response.",

An early review of familial HLH described a mean survival from onset of symptoms of less than 1 month and an overall 1 year survival from diagnosis of 5 % [ 71 ] . Reported mortality for untreated secondary HLH is 50 % [ 4 ] . However, with current therapies, survival rates ranging from 50 to 70 % are now being reported [ 72 ] . Therefore, it is recommended that specifi c therapy be initiated as soon as there is a high clinical suspicion for HLH even if confi rmatory diagnostic or genetic studies are still pending. Specifi c protocols to standardize the rational treatment of HLH were established fi rst in 1994 and then revised in 2004 [ 13 , 73 ] .",

Children manifesting with ARDS or severe neurologic decompensation often require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Shock should be treated with appropriate fl uid resuscitation and inotropic support. Individuals with signifi cant kidney injury may need renal replacement therapy. Antimicrobial therapy must be provided to eradicate comorbid infections or infections that may have triggered a secondary form of HLH. In this regard, broad spectrum antibiotics are essential early in the course of disease that should be appropriately narrowed once an organism has been identifi ed. Prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fl uconazole are commonly given. Rituximab can be helpful in the setting of EBV driven HLH by depleting EBV-laden B cells.",

Corticosteroids are used for their nonspecifi c anti-infl ammatory properties to suppress hypercytokinemia and promote lymphocyte apoptosis. Dexamethasone is the preferred agent because of its ability to cross the blood brain barrier and quench infl ammation in the central nervous system. Etoposide induces cell cycle arrest, and therefore, interferes with lymphocyte proliferation. Cyclosporin disrupts intracellular signal transduction pathways preventing T cell activation and cytokine elaboration. Children with persistent or progressive central nervous system involvement are given intrathecal methotrexate which is toxic to the rapidly dividing immune cells. In addition, effi cacy has been reported anecdotally with non-protocol therapies. For example, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) selectively depletes T cells, [ 75 ] while alemtuzumab (Campath\u00ae, humanized anti-CD52) targets both antigen presenting cells and T cells for elimination [ 76 , 77 ] . Abatacept (Orencia\u00ae), a fusion protein capable of blocking the B7 co-stimulatory signals necessary for T cell activation, has also been reported to improve symptoms [ 74 ] . Consultation with subspecialists experienced in the treatment of HLH is essential to appropriately navigate the application of these nuanced interventions.",

Many isolated clinical characteristics are shared with other disease processes, including septic shock, but specifi c criteria have been established to facilitate the appropriate diagnosis. Disease specifi c treatment should be started as soon as possible to prevent progression of morbidity and mortality. HLH cannot be reversed by critical care interventions alone. Dexamethasone, etoposide, and cyclosporin form the mainstay of pre-transplant therapy. All children with primary HLH and many children with secondary HLH require HSCT to eradicate their disease. Current overall survival rates have improved to approximately 60-70 %.
