For phylogenetic analysis, sequences from this study were aligned with one another and with VHSV reference sequences using ClustalW in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version 6.0 software (Tamura et al. 2013). Model selection for phylogenetic reconstruction was then performed in MEGA 6.0, whereby the model with the lowest Bayesian information criterion (Kimura two\u2010parameter model with gamma distribution, K2+G) was selected. Neighbor\u2010joining analysis was conducted in MEGA 6.0, and topology robustness was assessed via bootstrap analysis (n = 1,000 re\u2010samplings).

The low species\u2010specific sample sizes by source (i.e., in\u2010state and out\u2010of\u2010state) limited our ability to detect differences in viral prevalence between sources using ANOVA with the appropriate statistical power. Fathead minnow nidovirus was isolated from six out\u2010of\u2010state source lots of Fathead Minnow (6 of 30) and three lots of Emerald Shiners (3 of 42), two of which originated from in\u2010state sources. Golden shiner reovirus was isolated from only out\u2010of\u2010state\u2010sourced baitfish. Specifically, GSRV was isolated from 5 of 11 Golden Shiner lots and 3 of 30 Fathead Minnow lots. The OIE\u2010reportable VHSV was also isolated from one in\u2010state source lot of Emerald Shiners (1.1%; Table 3). Within that lot, VHSV was confirmed in 2 of 12 pooled samples of Emerald Shiners by using RT\u2010PCR. The intensity of the VHSV\u2010positive pooled samples was 1.4 \u00d7 108 to 3.4 \u00d7 108 per mg of tissue. Further phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the two VHSV isolates belonged to VHSV genotype IVb (96.9\u201397.8% similarity in the N\u2010gene), as they fell into a well\u2010supported cluster containing VHSV genotype IVb isolates only (Figure 2). However, the two Emerald Shiner isolates were also distinct from the other genotype IVb sequences, as evidenced by the formation of a well\u2010supported subclade (Figure 2). None of the Sand Shiner, Spottail Shiner, Northern Redbelly Dace, Blacknose Dace, or Weed Shiner tissue samples developed any CPE on EPC cells (Table 3).",

            "text": "Our findings clearly demonstrated that baitfish obtained from retail bait vendors harbor OIE\u2010notifiable and baitfish\u2010associated viruses that are not only infectious to cyprinids but also to a wide range of other fish species (Faisal et al. 2012, 2016). Surprisingly, some of the infected fish exhibited pronounced external signs of disease and yet remained for sale, with the possibility of ultimately finding their way into numerous waterbodies. This study clearly documents that the end of the trade custody chain (i.e., baitfish retail shops) represents a source for the potential introduction of viruses to public waters via angler\u2010purchased and potentially released baitfish. This situation highlights the need for regulatory intervention to implement health inspection of the baitfish supply chain. Considering the ease with which viruses can be disseminated due to their wide host range and the ecological niche of these prey fish species, one would expect that VHSV, FHMNV, and GSRV will continue their expansion\u2014not only in the Great Lakes but also in the inland lakes and waterways of Michigan. The potential increased risk from VHSV and FHMNV spreading via the baitfish trade is indeed alarming, particularly because of the pathological consequences of these viruses. Additionally, since 61 of the 159 fish species residing in the Great Lakes basin are threatened or endangered (GLFC 2016), an expansion of viruses with wide host range via the baitfish trade could exacerbate the tenuous status of the fish stocks that are at risk. In the same context, many important fish species that are the focus of stock enhancement programs at state and federal hatcheries in the Great Lakes region are fed with baitfish purchased from private sources prior to their stocking in public waters. The Muskellunge is one such species that is fed baitfish in hatcheries and has proven susceptible to both VHSV and FHMNV (Faisal et al. 2012, 2016). As a consequence, this practice may expose a highly susceptible fish species to potentially lethal, debilitating viral infections, and widespread stocking of these fish may lead to further expansion into new geographic areas.",

Whether the two Emerald Shiner isolates form a distinct genomovar remains to be elucidated. In a previous study, Thompson et al. (2011) compared the partial G\u2010gene sequence of 108 VHSV\u2010IVb isolates from the Great Lakes and found the genetic diversity among the isolates to be relatively low; however, those authors were able to identify 11 unique sequences. Although the two Emerald Shiner isolates from the present study closely resembled one another, some sequence variation was observed, indicating the occurrence of continuous genetic alterations in the G\u2010gene among isolates retrieved from the same fish host. The possibility that in the future, new isolates of VHSV\u2010IVb could be spread to VHSV\u2010free waterbodies through baitfish is indeed alarming.",

This is also alarming because the prevalence by lot in these species reached 12.5% (9 positive lots of 72 lots examined), and the number of positive pools within these lots reached as high as 11 of 12 pools. As the name of the virus implies, the Fathead Minnow is believed to be the primary host. However, several other baitfish species were reported to contract the infection naturally (e.g., Creek Chub Semotilus atromaculatus; McCann 2012) or experimentally (e.g., Spotfin Shiner Cyprinella spiloptera and Golden Shiner; Baird and Faisal 2016), indicating the relatively wide host range of the virus among cyprinids. Thus, the relatively high prevalence of FHMNV in baitfish retail stores constitutes a potential hazard for cyprinid populations in the receiving waterbodies. In this study, FHMNV was identified both in apparently healthy fish (5 of 9 positive lots) and in fish exhibiting clinical signs. This indicates that a definitive diagnosis should be based on virus isolation and confirmation by molecular or serological testing. The risk of FHMNV extends also to Muskellunge raised in hatcheries, where baitfish constitute a primary food source. Indeed, Muskellunge are vulnerable to FHMNV infection and can contract the virus by cohabitation and predation on infected fish (Baird and Faisal 2016; Faisal et al. 2016). Although FHMNV has been reported in Michigan previously (Faisal et al. 2016), infected baitfish can disseminate it further to otherwise virus\u2010free waterbodies. This study reports, for the first time, that Emerald Shiners are also susceptible to FHMNV.",

McCann (2012) demonstrated that a GSRV strain that was isolated from a baitfish sample could be lethal to Fathead Minnow after experimental intraperitoneal injection. The Chinese grass carp reovirus, another member of the Aquareovirus C group that closely resembles GSRV, has been detected in moribund and healthy Golden Shiners, Fathead Minnow, Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, and Creek Chub (McEntire et al. 2003; Goodwin et al. 2006).

In a recent study, SVCV was identified as the cause of morbidity and mortality with varying degrees of pathogenicity in baitfish species (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Golden Shiner) after waterborne immersion (Boonthai et al. 2017b) and in Emerald Shiners and White Suckers via intraperitoneal infection (Misk et al. 2016).

It is likely that the high virus prevalence reflects the stressful conditions under which these fish are maintained, including high\u2010density storage, limited or no feeding, and frequent handling. It likely also reflects the lack of basic biosecurity practices at bait shops, including the removal of moribund and dead fish, based on mortalities observed in tanks during collections. The prevalence of FHMNV and the existence of VHSV in the retail bait shops combined with the high frequency of baitfish use among anglers result in a high risk for new introductions (Drake and Mandrak 2014). This risk is particularly elevated when considering that anglers have been documented to release unused baitfish at rates as high as over 40% (Litvak and Mandrak 1993; Kilian et al. 2012). As such, there is a need for managerial intervention to abrogate or slow down the rate of viral expansions from this vector. In Michigan, with regard to all baitfish imported from out of state or harvested from Michigan waters, an annual health inspection of retail vendors and health certification of baitfish dealers should be required for each pathogen of concern, especially VHSV. The inclusion of at least FHMNV as a pathogen of concern for baitfish health certification should be considered. Although SVCV was not found in this study, baitfish health certification testing for this pathogen should be considered, particularly for fish being imported from areas where SVCV is endemic.",

In addition to best management practices during collections, it is critical to enforce existing Michigan regulations that prohibit the dumping of unused baitfish back into public waters. Unfortunately, the regulatory frameworks for baitfish vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, thus leading to easier entry points for diseased bait to move into the Great Lakes basin. Public educational campaigns should also complement enforcement actions to decrease the unused\u2010baitfish release behavior that is common among anglers. Based on our findings, we recommend a combination of increased surveillance, implementation of best management practices, additional enforcement, and an increased outreach campaign to ensure that pathogenic viruses do not spread further throughout the Great Lakes region via the baitfish trade.",
