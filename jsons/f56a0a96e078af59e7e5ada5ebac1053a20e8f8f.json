There is a need to identify key pathogenic molecules in COVID-19-associated inflammation attainable to target with existing therapeutic compounds. The endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule HMGB1 initiates inflammation via two separate pathways. Disulfide-HMGB1 triggers TLR4 receptors generating pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Extracellular HMGB1, released from dying cells or secreted by activated innate immunity cells, forms complexes with extracellular DNA, RNA and other DAMP or pathogen-associated molecular (DAMP) molecules released after lytic cell death. These complexes are endocytosed via RAGE, constitutively expressed at high levels in the lungs only, and transported to the endolysosomal system, which is disrupted by HMGB1 at high concentrations. Danger molecules thus get access to cytosolic proinflammatory receptors instigating inflammasome activation. It is conceivable that extracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA may reach the cellular cytosol via HMGB1-assisted transfer combined with lysosome leakage. Extracellular HMGB1 generally exists in vivo bound to other molecules, including PAMPs and DAMPs. It is plausible that these complexes are specifically removed in the lungs revealed by a 40% reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood. Abundant pulmonary RAGE expression enables endocytosis of danger molecules to be destroyed in the lysosomes at physiological HMGB1 levels, but causing detrimental inflammasome activation at high levels. Stress induces apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells from females but necrosis in cells from males.",

The recently identified Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may cause pneumonia and primarily infects respiratory epithelial cells utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as receptors to gain access to cells (Yan et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020) . Age above 60 years, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease have been identified as major risk factors for the development of COVID-19, progressing to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with sometimes lethal outcome (Rothan and Byrareddy 2020; Lake 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Guan et al. 2020) . There is experimental evidence that a compromised T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxic capacity developing during aging mediates the age-dependency of the outcome of the infection. Cytotoxic T cells kill virusinfected cells in a very specific and selective way, causing a silent apoptotic death of the target cell. Void of efficient cytotoxic T cells, innate immunity must try bear the burden of battling the infection. This comes at a high cost. Many more cells will be killed, both virusinfected and bystander cells, and the modes of cell death are highly proinflammatory, involving necrosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis.",

Active HMGB1 release is initiated with a regulated translocation of the nuclear pool of HMGB1 to the cytosol (Bonaldi et al. 2003) . Type 1 and type 2 interferons are highly potent endogenous molecules that launch this intracellular relocalization of HMGB1 (Lu et al. 2014; Tanaka et al. 2019) . Consequently, administration of interferons as therapeutic antiviral compounds risks to increase extracellular HMGB1 levels, which may promote inflammation rather than mediate beneficial effects. Many chronic inflammatory diseases are characterized by increased circulating HMGB1 levels, possibly of importance for the increased risk of severe outcome in COVID-19 patients with inflammatory comorbidities. Excessive extracellular HMGB1 quantities cause tissue damage and organ dysfunction. In a clinical study, lethality in bacterial pneumonia complicated by ARDS was strongly predicted by initial appropriate antibiotic use and plasma HMGB1 levels (Tseng et al. 2014) . Treatment with HMGB1-specific antagonists ameliorates inflammation and improves survival in many preclinical models of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases (Andersson and Tracey 2011; Kang et al. 2014; Andersson et al. 2018b; Yang et al. 2020) . However, therapy with HMGB1-specific antagonists has not yet been studied in clinical trials.",

Steric hindrance precludes antibody detection of HMGB1 epitopes without a proper removal of HMGB1-partner molecules at the initial buffer exposure.

Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from patients receiving long-term mechanical ventilation and ventilatorassociated pneumonia have been demonstrated to contain high levels of HMGB1 (van Zoelen et al. 2008) . A further understanding of a pathogenic role of local HMGB1 release in pulmonary barotrauma is provided by studies in rabbits exposed to mechanical ventilation with large versus small tidal volumes (Ogawa et al. 2006) . Large tidal volumes caused prominent ventilatorinduced lung injury, which was associated with 5-fold higher HMGB1 concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid than those in the low tidal group. Immunostaining of lung tissue showed that alveolar macrophages and infiltrating neutrophils were the major sources of extracellular HMGB1. Interestingly, prophylactic intratracheal installation of anti-HMGB1 antibodies limited microvascular permeability and neutrophil influx into the alveolar lumen and improved oxygenation.",

Female pulmonary endothelial cells exposed to the same stress preferentially responded by apoptotic cell death. Elevated necrosis was accompanied by significant extracellular HMGB1 release, in contrast to consequences of apoptosis.

Subsequent studies have localized RAGE expression to the basal membrane of type 1 alveolar epithelial cells, and RAGE has been defined as a specific marker of these cells (Shirasawa et al. 2004; Fehrenbach et al. 1998; Ota et al. 2016) . Conflicting results have been reported regarding RAGE expression on type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (Shirasawa et al. 2004; Katsuoka et al. 1997 ). RAGE will be expressed on vascular endothelial cells and macrophages during inflammatory responses (Brett et al. 1993 ) (Bierhaus et al. 2005; Oczypok et al. 2017) . RAGE was originally identified in diabetes research as a cell surface receptor generating a cascade of intracellular signaling, including nuclear NF-kB translocation and proinflammatory cytokine release (Schmidt et al. 1996) . It was later discovered that RAGE is a multiligand receptor and that HMGB1 is one out of many ligands (Rauvala and Rouhiainen 2007) . The HMGB1-RAGE axis triggers neutrophil-mediated injury amplification following necrosis (Huebener et al. 2015) , something that is of great significance for the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Interestingly, HMGB1-RAGE interaction does not primarily lead to proinflammatory intracellular signaling. Macrophages expressing RAGE, but engineered to lack TLR4 expression, do not produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to stimulation by HMGB1 of any redox isoform (Yang et al. 2010) . That is not the expected result if HMGB1-RAGE interaction mediated cytokine release in a direct mode.",

The HMGB1/RAGE-assisted cellular import system performs an important task by alerting cells about a dangerous extracellular environment. Most importantly, HMGB1 has a unique ability to act as a detergent in the lysosomal membrane due to the acidic conditions inside the lysosome system (Deng et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2014; Yuan et al. 2020) . The HMGB1-transported partner molecules will thus avoid the expected degradation in the lysosomes and instead leak out into the cytosol to reach cognate cytoplasmic receptors, propagating a proinflammatory response. The biological implications of this mechanism may be of tremendous importance for the pathogenesis of severe pulmonary inflammation because the high constitutive cell surface RAGE expression. It has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies that severe respiratory infections including influenza and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) generate substantial extracellular HMGB1 release in pulmonary inflammation and that HMGB1-specific antagonists ameliorate these conditions (Ito et al. 2011; Nosaka et al. 2015; Nosaka et al. 2018; Hatayama et al. 2019; Manti et al. 2018; Rayavara et al. 2018; Rallabhandi et al. 2012; Simpson et al. 2020) . Extracellular HMGB1 accumulates locally due to passive release from dying cells and active secretion from innate immunity cells and additional cell types. Furthermore, virus-induced cell death also generates huge quantities of extracellular DNA, RNA, nucleosomes and histones. These molecules are of no major concern as long as they remain extracellularly or get degraded in the lysosomes after cellular import.",

Arterial HMGB1 concentrations were consistently lower than venous concentrations in simultaneously obtained samples (arterial = 0.60 x venous; 95% CI 0.30-0.90). Significant amounts of HMGB1 are thus apparently removed in the pulmonary circulation. We doubt that an elimination of HMGB1 itself is the physiological purpose (1); these complexes bind to RAGE abundantly expressed in the lungs (2); and get endocytosed to endosomes having TLR receptors including TLR4 which may be activated by HMGB1 (3); HMGB1 and partner molecules translocate to lysosomes, where HMGB1 acts like a detergent under the acidic conditions and disrupts the lysosomal membrane enabling HMGB1-partner molecules access to the cytosol (4); the translocated molecules bind and activate reciprocal cytoplasmic receptors generating inflammasome activation and additional proinflammatory events (5); the subsequent outcome production and extracellular release of cytokines via pore formation in the cell surface membrane accomplished by oligomerized gasdermin D. The final outcome is pyroptosis. Active gasdermin D also rotates and translocates phosphatidylserine molecules to the outside of the cell surface membrane and induces tissue factor on endothelial cells. This biology initiates coagulation (6) of this function, but rather to degrade PAMP and DAMP molecules carried by HMGB1. The abundant and selective expression of RAGE in the lungs supports extensive endocytosis of HMGB1-partner molecule complexes. These complexes pass the endosomes to accumulate in the lysosomes. We anticipate that physiological amounts of HMGB1 are insufficient to damage the lysosomal membrane allowing the expected degradation of the HMGB1-partner molecule complexes. However pathologically increased intralysosomal HMGB1 levels might cause lysosomal disruption, as already discussed. The leakage sanctions inflammasome activation generating pyroptosis and tissue injury. We suggest that this may be a main mechanism leading to lung injury.",

These viruses, like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, replicate in respiratory epithelial cells and cause necrotic tissue damage. Influenza-infected patients express elevated circulating HMGB1 concentrations that are associated with the development of severe pneumonia (Ito et al. 2011) .

Successful preclinical treatment results using specific HMGB1-, TLR4or RAGE-antagonists further support that the HMGB1/ RAGE/TLR4-axis is central in the pathogenesis of influenza infections. Treatment with anti-HMGB1 mAb provided partial protection against both pneumonia and encephalopathy in murine models of influenza infections despite that the treatments did not affect virus propagation in the lungs (Nosaka et al. 2015; Nosaka et al. 2018; Hatayama et al. 2019) . Combined anti-HMGB1 mAb and anti-viral treatment offered almost complete protection against lung injury (Hatayama et al. 2019) . Improved survival combined with significantly attenuated histological changes and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs of influenza-inoculated mice have been reported, despite that the treatment was based on xenogenic polyclonal antibodies against HMGB1 . Therapy with the TLR4-blocking compound eritoran ameliorated murine influenza-induced lung injury by inhibiting the cytokine storm. Additionally, eritoran has been reported to block HMGB1-mediated TLR4dependent signaling in vitro, and to inhibit extracellular HMGB1 release in vivo by preventing necroptotic cell death in respiratory epithelial cells (Shirey et al. 2013; Shirey et al. 2016) .",

The binding to caspase-11 causes oligomerization and activation of a complex that converts the pore-forming protein gasdermin D to a cleaved protein promoting the externalization of phosphatidylserine to the outer cell surface via a calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase (Fig. 1) . HMGB1 and LPS also enhance the expression and release of tissue factor that binds phosphatidylserine, which initiates the coagulation cascade. Treatment with anti-HMGB1 mAb in gram-negative sepsis prevented the coagulopathy ). These discoveries have wider implications than gram-negative sepsis biology, since also activated caspase-1, generated by multiple forms of activated inflammasomes, will cleave gasdermin D to a molecule that can activate the coagulation cascade and pyroptosis. The number of DAMPs and PAMPs that activates inflammasomes is considerable.",

A recent observational study of trauma patients reported that a biphasic release of HMGB1, with a second concentration peak 3-6 h after injury, was a powerful predictor of outcome (Ottestad et al. 2019b ). The first peak occurred immediately after the trauma presumably due to a massive necrotic cell death, however not correlated to outcome. The second-wave HMGB1 was a consistent and highly accurate predictor of the duration of the subsequent need for ventilator support, reflecting secondary remote lung injury. Interestingly, second-wave HMGB1 rendered robust predictors like injury severity and physiological derangement (base deficit) insignificant in multivariable prediction models or outcome, possibly acting as a mediator of the combined detrimental effects of anatomical injury and physiologic derangement after trauma. The reasons for the discrepancy between the predictive value of the second versus the initial peak of HMGB1 release are presently not known. We speculate that the two waves of HMGB1 were made up by different HMGB1 redox isoforms as a plausible explanation.",

It is somewhat of a paradox that there are few other conceivable therapeutic target molecules that have been studied in so many successful preclinical inflammatory diseases (reviewed in (Andersson and Tracey 2011; Kang et al. 2014; Andersson et al. 2018b; Nishibori et al. 2019) ) and yet it is not presently possible to specifically target HMGB1 in any clinical settings. These preclinical treatment studies have been based on administration of recombinant HMGB1 box A protein for HMGB1 receptor blockade or anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibodies to inhibit extracellular pro-inflammatory activity via HMGB1 neutralization (Andersson and Tracey 2011; Andersson et al. 2018a; Musumeci et al. 2014) . A further clinical development of box A protein has until now been precluded by the lack of in vitro assays evaluating the performance of individual batches. However, this obstacle may now be overcome, since such assays have been accomplished recently (Yang et al. 2019a) . Creation of efficient anti-HMGB1 mAbs successfully used in preclinical studies has so far exclusively been contributed by academic research groups. Most of these antibodies are of murine origin, but at least two humanized anti-HMGB1 mAbs have so far been designed (Nishibori et al. 2019; Lundback et al. 2016) . A major hurdle for the academia has been a lack of financing enabling clinical studies. The competition around resources to produce and study novel biologics is very challenging.",

            "text": "Chloroquine phosphate-based therapy in China and hydroxychloroquine treatment in South Korea have been reported to improve outcome in COVID-19 infections (Gao et al. 2020) , but larger controlled studies are still missing. There are several studies indicating that chloroquine compounds exert direct anti-viral activities. Vincent et al. reported that chloroquine prevented the spread of the SARS coronavirus in cell culture by interfering with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This might negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and thus abrogate the infection (Vincent et al. 2005) . As already referred to, a recently published clinical pilot study indicated that hydroxychloroquine treatment was significantly associated with a reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load (Gautret et al. 2020 ). These and other small anectodal studies have been challenged and randomized clincal trials have yet to establish the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for use in Covid-19. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine compounds also exert multiple anti-inflammatory effects and have been used for a long time to treat chronic inflammation in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The mechanisms for these anti-inflammatory effects are not fully understood, but some have been established and will be outlined here. Chloroquine has been demonstrated to decrease HMGB1 secretion from activated innate immunity cells (Schierbeck et al. 2010) . Chloroquine-mediated alkalinization of lysosomes inhibiting HMGB1-caused lysosomal leakage is a plausible mechanism that might be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment to prevent lysosomal leakage (Fig. 2) . Intact lysosome function will prevent the activation of multiple proinflammatory cytosolic receptors. Neutrophils exert a central role in the generation of acute lung injury (Rebetz et al. 2018 ) and acute pancreatitis (Murthy et al. 2019) . It is thus relevant to consider that chloroquine has been reported to mediate beneficial treatment effects in a preclinical model of acute pancreatitis by reducing the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (Papayannopoulos 2018) . NETs are generated when activated neutrophils release their DNA, histones, HMGB1, and intracellular granule components that together promotes inflammation and tissue damage.",

Heparin-HMGB1 complexes are unable to induce RAGE dimerization that is required for the function of RAGE (Rouhiainen et al. 2018) (Fig. 2) . Heparin treatment reduced the lethality in mice exposed to LPS-HMGB1 complexes (Li et al. 2015) . Since heparin treatment includes risks of causing potentially dangerous bleeding one might consider to use low-molecular heparin preparations with very low anticoagulant activity but preserved capacity to bind to HMGB1. One such heparinoid compound has been successfully tested clinically in phase I/II studies of Plasmodium falciparum malaria disease (Leitgeb et al. 2017 ). This molecule also prevented neutrophil-induced lung plasma leakage in a murine sepsis model (Rasmuson et al. 2019) .

These receptors are expressed on alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells (Su et al. 2007 ). Specific \u03b17 nAChR agonist therapy decreased excess lung water, lung vascular permeability, and reduced protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage in a preclinical model of sterile acute injury. Alpha7 nAChR genedeficient mice expressed a 2-fold increase in excess lung water and lung vascular permeability in the same model (Su et al. 2007 ). These results indicate that neuronal mechanisms may down-regulate pulmonary inflammation, something that might provide novel therapeutic opportunities. A link between the cholinergic antiinflammatory system and HMGB1-induced inflammation is that RAGE-mediated endocytosis of HMGB1 complexes with other proinflammatory molecules is restrained by acetylcholine as well as \u03b17nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR)-specific agonists (Yang et al. 2019a) (Fig. 2 ). An analogous blockade of RAGE/ HMGB1-regulated endocytosis has been demonstrated to be mediated by truncated HMGB1 box A protein, an anti-HMGB1 mAb (2G7), and dynamin inhibitors (Yang et al. 2019a) .",

            "text": "a) The function of HMGB1 for innate immunity is as important as MHC molecules for adaptive immunity. Each carries and presents antigens, although the systems operate in opposite directions. An MHC antigen binds its peptide intracellularly before it expresses the complex on the cell surface to be recognized by a T cell receptor. HMGB1 catches danger molecules extracellularly and brings the complexes intracellularly for destruction. However, a high intralysosomal HMGB1 concentration disrupts the lysosomal membrane allowing danger molecule access to cytosolic receptors mediating inflammation. b) Exaggerated host inflammatory response is a major cause of lung injury and subsequent mortality in many severe pulmonary inflammatory conditions including COVID-19. A hyperexcited HMGB1-RAGE axis can be expected in COVID-19 since necrotic respiratory epithelial cells contribute with large amounts of extracellular HMGB1, and its cognate receptor RAGE is constitutively abundantly expressed in the lungs. Once initiated, inflammation will be intensified via HMGB1 secretion from innate immunity cells causing further RAGE and TLR4 upregulation. c) Arterial HMGB1 levels are considerably lower than those in venous blood and we propose that this connects systemic HMGB1 biology to lung physiology. HMGB1-danger molecule complexes are transported via RAGE to the endolysosomal compartment. Proper lysosomal degradation of these complexes is mandatory for pulmonary function. Increased intralysosomal HMGB1 concentrations cause lysosomal destabilization allowing danger molecules access to potent cytoplasmic receptors causing inflammation that can be lethal. d) HMGB1 acts upstream of the proinflammatory cytokine cascade (Andersson et al. 2000) . e) HMGB1 is a DNA-and RNA-binding molecule and HMGB1 has been demonstrated to function as a gene delivery agent. There is a risk that HMGB1 might attach to viral RNA and bring it to the cytosol via the RAGE-lysosomal pathway. This would implicate that there could be an additional pathway apart from the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors enabling intracellular virus replication. f) A substantial number of preclinical studies demonstrates that HMGB1 antagonists ameliorate severe pulmonary inflammation regardless of infectious or sterile origin. A further study of a therapeutic use of HMGB1-specific antagonists is warranted. Means to prevent HMGB1-danger molecule complexes from binding to RAGE should be sought for.
