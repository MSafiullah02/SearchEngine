The announcement states that, due to the potential risk of further community transmission, the initiative of \u2018Level 1 Response to Public Health Emergencies\u2019 (the highest in the rank)\u2014an initiative invented in 2005 to prevent another traumatic 2003 SARS-like pandemic outbreak\u2014must be launched to tackle the latest \u2018category A infectious disease\u2019 (the highest in the category). Within a week, governments of regions outside Wuhan, beginning with Shanghai and most cities in the Zhejiang Province (Zhang and Chen 2020), declared that, being authorized by the initiative, the government would execute \u2018a complete lockdown within the administrative area\u2019. The lockdown enforced, among many clauses, a complete shutdown on work, enterprise, public transportation, and any unauthorized mobilization of any individual, prosecuting violators for criminal responsibility (Xinhua Net 2020).",

In contrast to a proactionary approach, which would seek promotion of the best available responses to the pandemic, China\u2019s precautionary policy is aimed at prevention of the worst outcome, including but not exclusive to potential high mortality numbers caused by massive infection and social instability resulting from public panic (Morello-Frosch 2002). In line with the precautionary principle, lockdown has been enforced to keep people\u2019s lives slightly above bare minimum, buying time for experts to carefully study root causes and potential damage of the virus with a long-term focus, so that the state can seek ways to recover living conditions as the pandemic fades away.",

According to the State Council (2018), China has over 60 million MSMEs, which together contribute to over 50% of total taxation, 60% of gross domestic product, 70% of technological innovation, 80% of employment opportunities, and 90% of all enterprises. Announced policies encourage traditionally conservative MSMEs owners to make their first loans and demand an increase in total balance of loans, along with mild decrease in average lending interest rate, from 18 large commercial banks. The policies might appear supportive, yet the press conference\u2014following precautionary logic of \u2018preventing social instability\u2019 (Fuller and Lipinska 2014)\u2014has failed to even mentioned severity of damages already caused by the lockdown. Presumably, these damages may be exceptionally long-lasting, if not deteriorating, due to the presence of the ever-powerful Blacklist and Joint Punishment System (the Blacklist System).",

In weeks following lockdown, less than 5% of all registered MSMEs in Shanghai have relaunched their daily operations, while more than 5% (especially in service industries) have already \u2018gave up resistance\u2019 and declared bankruptcy (China Economic News 2020). In mid-March, resumption rate is still low (for instance, it barely climbed to 27% in the city of Zhongshan in Guangdong Province), but recovery rate of production output is disproportionally lower than resumption rate. Caused by employment loss, insufficient domestic and foreign market demands, and problematic supply of raw materials, even \u2018recovered\u2019 MSMEs tend to under-perform (Cha 2020). Chinese Entrepreneurs (2020) shows that 80% of MSMEs owners believe that the manufacturing sector and other entities reliant on offline consumption bear the most damage, and that 2020 Covid-19-related damages are significantly higher than recorded 2003 SARS-related damages.",

Furthermore, their current migrant workers, after months of lockdown, might never return to work in developed areas such as Shanghai and Zhejiang Province. Thanks to China Western Development incentives for bridging development gaps, and also to disproportionally high economic damage caused by Covid-19 in developed areas, economic incentives for migration could be substantially reduced (Lin 2019). Aimed at protecting freedom of movement, Chinese labor legislation allows workers to quit their current jobs and move to other jobs without penalization. If employers lay them off work within the duration of contract, however, workers can appeal to the local Labor Bureau and get their salary up to their worked days with toppled with extra unemployment compensation. Under the circumstances, MSMEs owners can only reduce salaries to minimum levels, accept that many workers will permanently leave, and hope that they will not fall into the \u2018loan trap\u2019 following their inevitable losses.",

Undoubtedly, national quarantine in China has been very successful in containing the pandemic. Yet an unfortunate side effect of the lockdown is coercive prevention of MSMEs owners from voluntarily taking the risk of being infected by a virus with perhaps less than 10% fatality rate, and continuing their own career with other like-minded risk-takers. According to Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s prospect theory (1992), individuals faced with large losses can enter a \u2018nothing to lose\u2019 state of mind and become willing to accept more risk. Following this theory, MSMEs owners might be ready to accept higher health risks than they are permitted to accept during lockdown.",

What is the point of balance between the risk-takers and the risk-evaders? This dilemma is worthy of consideration in all countries that have successively tightened their domestic lockdown approaches since mid-March to the level of complete shutdown of \u2018survival-irrelevant\u2019 offline work. Some of these countries include Argentina, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, India, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Spain, South Africa, Tunisia, the UK, and various regions in the USA (Tendata 2020). This dilemma could also be applied to countries within the European Union, and states within the USA, which reacted to the pandemic very differently while participating in common economical and geopolitical spaces.",
