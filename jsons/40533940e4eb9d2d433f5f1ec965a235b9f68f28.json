            "text": "High-risk PCa is still diagnosed in almost 27 000 patients19    annually in the USA, representing 15% of all cases[1]. By the 20 end of the last decade, a higher rate of aggressive PCa21 patterns (Gleason 4 + 4 and high D'Amico risk) was 22 detected; the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force 23 (USPSTF) recommendation against screening may have 24 contributed to this occurrence [2]. 25 As part of a multimodal approach, surgery is still the 26 basis of treatment for high-risk PCa. A recent meta-analysis 27 by Wang et al [3] highlighted the role of radical 28 prostatectomy (RP) in this setting: surgery was associated 29 with higher overall and cancer-specific survival when 30 compared to radiation therapy (RT). Apart from the 31 theoret Q3 ical advantage of RT in eliminating local micro-32 metastases, practice shows that a real multimodal approach 33 is probably applied for patients choosing RP, whereas 34 patients choosing RT first rarely receive salvage RP. 35 Recognizing the role of surgery in high-risk PCa, which 36 are the harms of delayed RP? The answer to this question can be derived from 37 surgical experience in the post-2012 USPSTF setting at a 38 referral center [4]. Cases with aggressive PCa treated with 39 RP are prone to impaired functional outcomes and a higher 40 rate of biochemical recurrence at 12 mo, despite no change 41 in surgical margin status [4]. The latter-representing 42 effective tumor excision but impaired oncologic follow-43 up-may reflect the harm of aggressive PCa, deriving 44 either from delayed detection or delayed treatment. If a 45 delay would affect outcomes and RP needs to be carried 46 out in a timely manner, how can clinicians ensure a safe 47 intervention while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 48 infection during hospitalization? 49 First, to reduce the burden of surgical interventions and 50 their impact on patient health, high-risk PCa patients 51 should be referred to high-volume centers and surgeons, 52 with the likelihood of a fast discharge and use of an 53 enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol. Further-54 more, the decision on whether or not to perform extended 55 nodal dissection in the current scenario could be debatable 56 given the lack of certain oncologic benefit and the possible 57 role of prostate-specific membrane antigen-based positron 58 emission tomography for preoperative nodal staging 59 [5]. Currently, pelvic nodal dissection is the major driver 60 of postoperative complications, carrying a 10% risk of 61 symptomatic lymphocele [5]. Complications may lead to a 62 delay in adjuvant treatment and, at worst, leave the patient 63 prone to postoperative infection due to bacterial or viral 64 transmission. 65 Second, safe surgery should be performed in COVID-19-66 free facilities, otherwise, according to reports from Wuhan, 67 postoperative mortality can reach 20% [6]. In addition, 68 according to the Italian experience, preservation of COVID-69 19-free areas within mixed facilities turned out to be 70 impossible: both caregivers and patients can bring the 71 infection while asymptomatic, contributing to further 72 nosocomial spread. Achievement of a real COVID-19-free 73 facility should rely on a preoperative quarantine period and 74 laboratory testing to confirm the absence of COVID-19 75 before entering the institution for both hospital staff and 76 oncology patients. 77 As the current pandemic poses unique challenges, 78 unique replies should be pursued to avoid COVID-19 79 transmission while ensuring appropriate cancer treatment 80 and timing during this unpredictable emergency.",
