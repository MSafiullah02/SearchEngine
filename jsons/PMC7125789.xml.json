Global cargo logistics entails multiple logistics nodes and the cooperative planning of multiple logistics stakeholders (Carlan, Sys, & Vanelslander, 2016). The connectivity of these nodes, e.g., distribution centers, sea container ports, airports, and transshipment hubs, becomes crucial for effective shipment planning. In cases where global supply chains with high tonnage and volume, the selection of a transshipment hub over a cargo flow becomes increasingly important to cost control and service reliability in the daily operations of logistics stakeholders.",

An increasing number of ports emerge as transshipment hubs, and some only provide transshipment service (Baird, 2006, Meersman et al., 2016). Traditionally, a transshipment port may act as simple as passing freight between ships and landside transport. Recently, a transshipment hub could include container terminals, cross-docks, consolidation centers, and other facilities beyond seaports and airports (Vis & de Koster, 2003). Thus operating a transshipment hub becomes complicated (Petering & Murty, 2009), such as storage yard management. Furthermore, selecting a transshipment hub is neither trivial nor straightforward. The selection has to assess transshipment hubs within the context of regional or global logistics network. It has to concern more on the connectivity among multiple ports, rather than the operational effectiveness of a single port. It may also need to consider the cross-boundary issues involved.",

            "text": "Referring to existing literatures on port selection, when it comes to the selection of a transshipment hub, we believe there are three overarching concerns that one would consider. Firstly, logistics stakeholders could prefer different transshipment hubs in global logistics due to their different business role. Shippers and freight forwarders often select a transshipment hub based on strategic and operational concerns respectively. For instance, shippers could make their strategic chain choice based on spatial, value, and organizational driving forces (Shi & Li, 2016). Shippers could operationally select a transshipment hub to align the strategic requirement, when ports are choices in hubs with different governmental regulations and service quality and efficiency (Steven and Corsi, 2012, Talley and Ng, 2013). While from forwarders\u2019 perspective, the hub selection is the core to strategic route optimization, which could considerably affect on-time delivery, operational efficiency, and service quality in cargo handling and customs clearance (Chu, 2014, Lirn et al., 2004, Nugroho et al., 2016, Tran, 2011).",

            "text": "Secondly, both sea and air transports should be options to be considered concurrently. The primary concern is the varying aspects of cargo flow. Nowadays, it is a common practice for logistics service providers and airlines to transport cargo from Asia via ocean to the Middle Eastern freight hub and then transfer to an aircraft for the second leg of the journey to Europe or Latin America (Kulisch, 2016). In Northern Canada, it has been witnessed that water conditions impact shippers\u2019 route choice decisions and the overall performance of multimodal freight transport systems (Du, Kim, & Zheng, 2017). Here an intermodal operator (e.g. shipper, carrier, or terminal operator) typically designs her service products by following dynamic allocation policies of resources (e.g. air and sea resources), and make her route choice based on the intermodal transportation network (Wang and Meng, 2017, Wang et al., 2017). Both the real-world practices and the relevant academic studies endorse that when selecting a transshipment hub, the services related to both sea and air transports should not be assessed in isolation.",

The effect of country of origin has been extensively studied in strategic management and organizational behavior (Song, Calantone, & Anthony, 2002). Country of origin, when associated with products, could be regarded as synonymous of high quality and original design, influencing the value perceived by the customers (Insch & McBride, 2004). It could also be a critical factor affecting particular strategic decision making, such as supply chain configuration of the firms (Brun et al., 2008, Teng and Jaramillo, 2005). Other literatures have suggested that companies with different country of origin could have significant different emphasis in strategic decision making (Demirbag et al., 2010, Harzing and Sorge, 2003). Similarly, in our study, a company's decision makers are likely to have deeper understanding of the ports in the region where their company originally established and more concrete knowledge of their country's unique competitive edge as a selling point in the market. The inherited know-how could influence decision makers\u2019 preference in choosing a transshipment hub.",

It is interesting to note that nine of out of the top ten container ports are in Asia and they are all competing for transshipment cargo. In this paper, Hong Kong and Taiwan's current role as a transshipment hub are examined in the greater China region where direct transportation link (DTL) policy has been implemented. As a transshipment hub, Hong Kong has enjoyed a steady increase in cargo flows since 2005.1\nHong Kong's transshipment hub status is unwavering as there is a lack of transportation policies between Taiwan and the Mainland. However, the DTL policy opens direct cargo flow, by sea and air, across the Straits between Taiwan and the Mainland China. Without direct flights to Taiwan from the Mainland, many thousands of Taiwanese companies based in Guangdong and Fujian provinces have to hub their components and finished products in their export operation through Hong Kong. Now related logistics stakeholders in the region have to carefully frame the global transport network and select transshipment hub accordingly.",

Instead, sea port selection problem has been extensively studied in the last decade, with respect to dominant sea freight regions, such as Greater China (Lirn, Thanopoulou, & Beresford, 2003), Southeast Asia (Tongzon, 2009), Western Asia (Sayareh & Alizmini, 2014), North American (Guy and Urli, 2006, Steven and Corsi, 2012), and European area (Onut, Tuzkaya, & Torun, 2011). These single transportation mode studies were conducted from the perspective of logistics stakeholders in the sea transport community. For instance, Nir, Lin, and Liang (2003) examined Taiwan shippers\u2019 behavior when making selection among the three local sea ports, while Lirn et al. (2004) studied the same set of ports from the perspective of global ocean container carriers. These studies provided an understanding of sea port selection in key global regions. More recently, Wang and Hong (2011a) argued, with respect to air freight transportation, Taiwan had taken on this endeavor to gain competitive advantages under Direct Transport Link policy. In our study, we are not looking at selection of a single-modal port among competitive ones in a region, but rather at the selection of a transshipment hub, where choices of different modals are presented, in the context of global cargo logistics.",

AHP is a flexible and powerful approach to measure both tangible and intangible criteria. With AHP, an expert develops multiple decision criteria with a hierarchy and assesses the relative importance of these criteria by comparing each pair of the criteria\u2014that is, a pairwise comparison process. Pairwise comparison can be conducted by surveying either the whole population or a sample of qualified decision-makers (Hughes, 2009, Lirn et al., 2003). With the relative importance of all the criteria, the overall ranking of the alternatives is then calculated. The rating is rather subjective and is based on the experience and expertise gained by the respondents. Therefore, AHP studies commonly take samples of experts or participants from top management teams (e.g. chief executive officer, general manager, or division director) of relevant organization(s) from professional industrial communities (Di Gravio, Patriarca, Mancini, & Costantino, 2016). Representative group judgments could be then obtained by aggregating individual weights through geometric mean (Van Den Honert & Lootsma, 1997).",

It is interesting to find that the stakeholders from the respective region tend to rate higher on their corresponding ports. As to all the Hong Kong logistics stakeholders, the gap between Hong Kong port to Taiwan port is larger than 1.367. It is understandable that uncertainties may exist in a port that is unfamiliar to the practitioners. It is also observed that the competitive advantage of Hong Kong port over Taiwan port in sea freight forwarding is not as significant as that in air freight forwarding.",

Customs regulations and government policies, and connectivity of Hong Kong port are rated higher than that of Taiwan ports, and the gap of these two criteria between Hong Kong port and Taiwan port is relatively large. Stakeholders are satisfied with the infrastructure and the connections in Hong Kong. Hong Kong still has the advantage due to frequent connections and a wider coverage; along with its well-developed customs regulations and government policies. While cost of route in Hong Kong is rated slightly higher than the one in Taiwan, most stakeholders are willing to pay more for the quality services. From these results, it is also interesting that sea freight forwarders in both Hong Kong and Taiwan are most concerned of the costs in the logistics practices as their profit margin is relatively low compared with other stakeholders.",

For example, the DTL policy has brought sound benefits to the cross-strait transportation services, such as shortened traveling time due to direct flights and vessels. For air freight, travelling time from Taoyuan airport in Taiwan to Shanghai airport in Mainland China has been reduced from 6\u20137 h to 84 min while the average transport time has been decreased by 16\u201327 h for sea freight.

As the seaports in Mainland China have been gradually developed with advanced technologies and facilities, the seaports in Hong Kong have yet to show similar driving force to maintain its leading role and competitiveness. Such lack of development progress would incur inconveniences and handicaps for 3PLs and shippers to make full use of the policy. Taiwan, on the other hand, ports have been unattractive possibly due to unstable climate especially in typhoon seasons, which could incur higher operation costs such as delays in cargo delivery. This could result in lower motivation for the 3PLs and shipping lines to use Taiwan ports. Indeed, comparatively inefficient facilities and less transparent cargo information lead to inconvenience to operators and 3PLs for cargo handling. The operators and 3PLs are reluctant to use Taiwan ports as they often are not responsive to operational and handling changes.",
