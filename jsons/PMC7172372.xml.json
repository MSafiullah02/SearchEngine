            "text": "Aminopeptidases comprise a family of zinc metalloproteinases that catalyze the removal of N-terminal amino acid residues from various protein substrates. Bestatin, [(2S,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoyl] leucine, isolated from culture filtrates of Streptomyces olivoreticuli (Umezawa et al., 1976), is a potent slow-binding inhibitor (K\ni=2.0\u00d710\u22128 M) of LAPase (EC 3.4.11.1) with various interesting immunomodulatory properties. Although Bestatin can effectively inhibit other aminopeptidases such as aminopeptidase B and to a lesser extent arginine aminopeptidase, it possesses a high specificity for LAPase (EC 3.4.11.1) forming a tetrahedral intermediate within the active site of the enzyme (Burley et al., 1991). In contrast, the membrane-bound aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.2), referred to as aminopeptidase-N, the putative receptor for some coronaviruses (Delmas et al., 1992, Delmas et al., 1993, Yeager et al., 1992), is significantly less inhibited by Bestatin (K\ni=1.4\u20134.1\u00d710\u22126 M), showing distinct inhibition kinetics (Rich et al., 1984, Wilkes and Prescott, 1985). These kinetic differences can be explained based on the different amino acid sequences encompassing the active site of these enzymes (Burley et al., 1991, Rogi et al., 1996).",

Based on the immunopotentiation properties ascribed to Bestatin, Hording et al. (1990)performed a double blind clinical study in a small number of HIV homosexual men. This group did not notice any benefit upon Bestatin treatment in terms of overall immune response. However, its direct effect on patient viral load was not analyzed. We have previously reported that Bestatin-mediated inhibition of cellular LAPase can decrease in vitro the level of infection of T-lymphocytic cells (Pulido-Cejudo et al., 1992). In this study we further characterize the effect of Bestatin and the possible role of LAPase in HIV infection. Briefly, the CD4+ human T-lymphocytic HUT78 cell line was infected in vitro with HTLVIIIb and its effect compared with both uninfected and chronically infected H9 CD4+ human T-lymphocytic cells. In this report, the inhibitory effect of Bestatin and the possible role of LAPase in HIV infection is documented.",

In the case of chronically-infected H9 cells, Bestatin was added at the same time and concentrations used for the HUT78 cells. Prior to use, Bestatin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO.) was resuspended in RPMI 1640 at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. In the continued presence of Bestatin, exponentially growing cells were subsequently infected with HTLVIIIb virus obtained from filtered cell supernatants using 0.45 \u03bcm filters (Nalgene, Rochester, NY). Briefly, cell pellets (6.0\u00d7106 cells) were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 alone or containing HTLVIIIb with a reverse transcriptase level of 2.3\u00d7106 cpm/ml. Infection was carried out for 2 h at 25\u00b0C with constant agitation in a final volume of 1.0 ml. Both chronically-infected H9 and in vitro-infected HUT78 human T-lymphocytic cells were subsequently washed with saline phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and seeded at a density of 1.0\u00d7105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin in 96-well plates. Syncytium formation was evaluated by light microscopy on days 3, 5 and 7. At various time points, the cells in selected wells were subjected to psoralen/ultraviolet light inactivation (Watson et al., 1990) air-dried and fixed on glass plates with cold acetone. Indirect immunofluorescent staining was performed using a modification of standard procedures (Johnson and Nogueira Araujo, 1981, Aldovini and Walker, 1990).",

A substantial decrease in PKC activity (Fig. 3c) was observed in Bestatin-treated cells in parallel with the decrease in LAPase activity suggesting a combined inhibitory effect of Bestatin that leads to a significant decrease in HIV infection. It is likely that the parallel inhibition of LAPase and protein kinase C accounts for the inhibition of HIV infection of HUT78 cells and thus the effect of exogeneously added purified LAPase on HIV infection was studied. In Table 3\nthe effect of LAPase in HIV infection is presented. HUT78 cells treated with LAPase followed by HIV infection were more susceptible to HIV infection showing higher syncytia numbers and extracellular p24 levels.

The antiviral effect of Bestatin seems to correlate with a decrease in both LAPase and PKC activities following a 12 h preincubation period prior to infection. In this regard, Kinter et al. (1990)have shown that the cytokine-mediated activation of PKC can enhance HIV expression in chronically infected promonocytic cells. Hence, it is possible that the concurrent inhibition of LAPase and PKC by Bestatin accounts for the inhibition of HIV infection of newly infected HUT78 and chronically infected H9 cells. The potential dual mechanism of Bestatin-mediated inhibition prompted us to analyze the effect of exogenously added purified LAPase in HIV infection. These experiments demonstrated that LAPase-treated HUT78 cells are in fact more prone towards HIV infection. Briefly, these cells showed higher syncytia numbers and extracellular p24 levels after pre-treatment and incubation with LAPase followed by HIV infection, when compared with cells infected alone. Taken together, these results suggest that cellular and extracellular LAPase exopeptidase activity can significantly potentiate HIV infection. In contrast, Bestatin effectively inhibits both cell-associated and extracellular exopeptidase activity of LAPase leading to a significant reduction in viral infection. The observed post-infection increase in cellular as well as extracellular LAPase activities may provide the basis for a sustained HIV infection. Concomitantly, Bestatin-mediated decrease in LAPase activity may account in part for the antiviral effect of Bestatin.",

This observation reinforces the implication of LAPase as a key cellular enzyme involved in the pathogenesis of HIV. While the exact mechanism of Bestatin-mediated inhibition of HIV infection requires further considerations such as its direct effect on virus-cell fusion, reverse trancriptase and protease activities, this study provides evidence in support of the possible role of cellular LAPase in early events of HIV infection. Recently, it has been suggested that following the required cleavage of HIV-1 envelope precursor glycoprotein (Env gp160) into gp120 and gp41 to promote viral-induced cell fusion, further cellular-mediated proteolytic processing at the V3 loop and at a novel site located within the carboxyl terminus of gp41 takes place (Rodriguez et al., 1995). We suggest that LAPase exopeptidase activity may be involved in the further cellular processing of Env during virus to cell and cell to cell fusion.",
