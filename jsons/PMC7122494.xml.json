Between 10 and 30%, there is overlap between the two labels [6, 7].Lesions predominate on the trunk and face and spread symmetrically to other areas of the body and the extremities (Image 2).

It appears that through an unknown mechanism, cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells begin to attack keratinocytes and cause massive apoptosis [16].By and large, when suspecting possible SJS/TEN in patients and hunting for causes, it is all about the drug history. Certain drugs are more likely to cause SJS/TEN.Short-Term Drug Use vs Long-Term Drug Use.The risk of SJS/TEN appears to be largely limited to the first 8 weeks of taking an at-risk medication. While it is possible to develop SJS/TEN after taking an at-risk drug for a longer period of time, it is unlikely [17, 18].\n\nLamotrigine ( Lamictal\u00ae) and SJS/TEN.The patient in this case had been started on Lamotrigine around 2 weeks prior to her presentation to the ED. Seven to ten percent of patients started on Lamotrigine will develop a rash, but only 3 in 1000 will require hospitalization [19]. Rash and other skin conditions are more common in children, so this medication is often reserved for adults [20].Appropriate dosing and dosing adjustment can prevent or decrease the risk of lamotrigine-associatedrashes. In adults, the recommended initial dose of lamotrigine alone (in the absence of cytochrome P-450 inhibitors or enhancers) is 25 mg po daily for the first 2 weeks, 50 mg daily during weeks 3 and 4, and then weekly increases of 50\u2013100 mg per day as clinically indicated. The patient in this case was started at 100 mg from day 1.\n\n\n\n",

Neutropenia in particular is indicative of a worse prognosis. Thrombocytopenia is seen as well but only in 10\u201320% of patients. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, mildly elevated serum transaminases, and elevated BUN are also often noted [7].\n3.As with many skin-related disorders, a biopsy can be very helpful and often definitively provide a diagnosis. Due to some skin diseases mimicking SJS/TEN, biopsy can be the only way to confirm the diagnosis. However, in the acute setting of the emergency department, skin biopsies are not going to happen, so the patient must be treated based on clinical judgment.\n",

While not generally used in the acute phase of illness, there is an algorithm, ALDEN, that has been developed to help define drug causality [28]. However in the ED setting you can stop all medications that seem possible culprits, particularly looking at medications started in the last 8 weeks.Employ anti-shear handling and try to avoid breaking large bullae if you can. Denuded skin leaks serum and becomes coated with necrotic debris. This combined with hemorrhagic crusting acts as an excellent substrate for bacteria leading to infection and possible sepsis, the leading cause of death in SJS/TEN [8].Hold on antibiotics unless you actually think there is a wound infection. Most of these patients will have fevers due to the associated inflammatory response. Pull the trigger if other signs of possible infection including confusion, hypotension, reduced urine output or oxygen saturation, or if an obvious wound infection is present. Be sure to cover for Staphyloccocus and Pseudomonas species with your antibiotic choice [8].\nRemember that SJS/TEN can involve the mucosa and even the GI tract! Complications of pneumonias, ARDS, small bowel ulcers and colonic perforations have been reported [29\u201331].The wounds from SJS/TEN can be thought of as similar to extensive burns. Treatment in a burn-unit setting is indicated and reduces mortality, particularly with TEN [32\u201334]. There are some important differences between SJS/TEN and burns!In SJS/TEN, the extent of skin damage is limited to the superficial dermal layers of the skin.SJS/TEN has less fluid, electrolyte and energy requirements. 2 ml/kg \u00d7 % affected TBSA of fluid is usually adequate to maintain urine output and blood pressure in the normal range [35]. Burns usually require more fluid recusitation [36].TEN often involves the GI tract, respiratory system, and the ocular system in addition to the skin. Significant sequelae in these organ systems are possible.\nAs there is frequent involvement of ocular surfaces and genital areas, often multiple specialties are involved in the inpatient management including ophthalmology and gynecology.IVIG, steroids, and cyclosporin have all been used in the treatment of SJS/TEN with mixed results [37]. These may be started in consultation with other services or the admitting team. In the ED, initial treatment is mostly supportive care.Prognosis.SCORTEN scoring system (SCORe of Toxic Epidermal Necrosis) has been developed that predicts the probability of hospital mortality [38]. There are seven parameters including age, malignancy, heart rate, TBSA, serum urea, glucose, and bicarbonate. Each positive is 1 point for a total of 7 points. The higher the score the greater mortality.\n\n\n",
