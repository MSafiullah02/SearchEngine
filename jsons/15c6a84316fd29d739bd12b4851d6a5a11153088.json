The already elevated risk of suicide in older adults has the potential to be increased by social isolation, anxiety and depression related to COVID-19, and by alcohol and other substance use. Racial/ethnic disparities in income and insurance coverage can exacerbate these problems. It is important for future research to examine how major categories of substance use impact COVID-19 outcomes among older adults, how social isolation and mental health conditions may increase substance use among older adults, and how intervention strategies (including those offered through telemedicine) can help to mitigate substance use problems. Providers should be alert to potential increases in substance use among vulnerable patients. Risks to older adults can be addressed by helping to expand access to interventions, and by incorporating the assistance of partners, family, and caregivers in helping older patients use healthier coping techniques to manage stress as the pandemic continues.
