The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate there are more than 350 million cases of acute gastroenteritis in the United States annually, and 48 million of these cases are caused by foodborne bacteria.\u2022Traveler\u2019s diarrhea affects more than half of people traveling from developed countries to developing countries. Prevention can be summarized by the caution, \u201cboil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it.\u201d\u2022Except in cases of fever, bloody diarrhea, immunocompromised patients, or patients with significant comorbidities, identifying a specific pathogen is rarely indicated in acute bacterial gastroenteritis because illness is usually self-limited.\u2022In both adult and pediatric patients, the prevalence of Clostridium difficile is increasing in the United States. Contact precautions, public health education, and prudent use of antibiotics are still necessary goals. Complicating these efforts are that there is increasing antibiotic resistance to C difficile and a new strain, NAP1/027/III, has been emerging since the early 2000s. This new strain has a high association with community onset and has been linked to increasing frequency and severity of illness. There is research into the possibility that the community onset may be related to animals and to retail meat, where the new strain has been detected.\u2022Preventing dehydration or providing appropriate rehydration is the primary supportive treatment of acute gastroenteritis.\n\n",

            "text": "\na.Enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) (Shiga toxin producing)\nE coli O157:H7 is 1 of at least 30 serotypes of E coli that make shiga-like toxin. It was discovered in 1982, after 2 outbreaks traced to undercooked beef. In May 2011, another serotype, O104:H4, was discovered in Germany.20 The CDC estimate 110,000 cases and 2100 hospitalizations annually in the United States.1\nTransmission: These bacteria are present in the intestines of cows and transferred initially through processing and then ingested through undercooked animal food products. Transmission can also occur through contaminated water, raw milk, unpasteurized apple cider, petting zoos, and day care centers.1\nPathophysiology: Bacteria attack epithelial cells of the cecum and the large bowel. The shiga-like toxins, called verotoxins, destroy the cells, leading to hemorrhagic colitis.Incubation: 1\u20139 days, with 3\u20134 days typicalSymptoms: Watery diarrhea develops that quickly becomes bloody. Elevated white cell count, abdominal pain, cramping, and vomiting are also commonly seen. The absence of fever (or only a low-grade fever) helps differentiate EHEC from other bacterial causes of bloody acute gastroenteritis.Duration: 1 week for uncomplicated EHEC infectionDiagnosis: The CDC recommend all stool cultures be screened for E coli O157:H and certainly all bloody stool samples. Fecal leukocytes are present in 50% of cases. E coli O157:H7 can be screened for using a sorbitol MacConkey agar. Both stool cultures and toxin assays are recommended.Complications: Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is associated with Shiga toxin 2 and is a complication seen in 6% to 9% of EHEC causes of acute gastroenteritis.21 The CDC estimate that greater than 90% of HUS is associated with E coli O157:H7. HUS is often seen in children younger than 4 years old and the elderly. There is some concern that empiric antibiotic use may increase the risk of developing HUS.22 Long-term sequelae caused by this complication include, hypertension, proteinuria, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and, less commonly, seizure, coma, or motor deficits.23\nThrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, which shares many similar features with HUS, presents with prominent neurologic findings rather than renal failure. Rarely, pseudomembranous colitis is associated with E coli O157:H7.Treatment: Treatment is largely supportive. Antibiotics do not shorten the duration of illness and should be avoided. There is some thought that empiric antibiotics or antiperistaltics may increase the chance of developing complications.24\nPrognosis: Uncomplicated cases resolve spontaneously in 7 to 10 days. A carrier state may last an additional 1 to 2 weeks. Hospitalization is required for 23% to 47% of patients, median length of stay 6 to 14 days. Mortality rate is 1% to 2% and is highest in the elderly population.1\nPrevention: The best prevention is practicing good hand hygiene and fully cooking meat. In addition, the Department of Agriculture has been improving and continues to improve the slaughter process.\nb.SalmonellaTransmission: Salmonella is transmitted through the consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked eggs, meats, raw milk, ice cream, peanuts, fruits, and vegetables. Transmission also occurs through contact with infected animals, such as turtles and pet ducklings.11\nPathophysiology: bacteria that survive the acidity of the stomach, colonize the intestine, and move across the intestinal epithelium, either by direct invasion of enterocytes or through dendritic cells inserted into epithelial cells. Once present, the inflammatory process begins releasing cytokines, neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells and B cells. This inflammatory response decreases normal intestinal flora and allows the pathogen to proliferate. The nontyphoid Salmonella produce a more localized response and the typhi serotype (the cause of typhoid fever) tends to be more invasive and more often results in bacteremia.25\nIncubation: 6\u201348 hours11\nDuration: 1\u20137 daysSymptoms: nausea, vomiting, fever, cramping abdominal pain, possibly bloody diarrheaTreatment: not usually recommended. Exceptions include severe illness, extremes of age, valvular heart disease, uremia, or malignancy. In the case of these exceptions, a third-generation cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone for 5 to 7 days is indicated.Complications: Antibiotic use can increase carrier state. Additional complications include transient reactive arthritis, which can be seen in up to 30% of adult patients, and Reiter syndrome, which occurs in 2% of patients.Prognosis: Most patients recover in 2 to 5 days. Sustained or intermittent bacteremia may occur in immunocompromised patients.\nc.\nCampylobacter jejuni\nPopulation: usually under 5 years of ageTransmission: handling or eating raw or undercooked poultry or raw milk or cheeses, by contaminated drinking water, or by handling infected animals1\nPathophysiology: direct invasion of epithelial cells of the colon inducing inflammationIncubation: 1 to 10 daysDuration: 5 to 14 daysSymptoms: Usually rapid onset with fever, chills, headache, and malaise followed by abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Diarrhea may be grossly bloody or melanotic in 60% to 90% of patients.Treatment: Empiric antibiotics are not recommended in healthy patients. Stool culture is appropriate. Antibiotics shorten the illness by 1 to 1.5 days. Erythromycin or azithromycin \u00d7 5 days (resistance to fluoroquinolones).Complications: Campylobacter jejuni gastroenteritis is associated with postinfectious Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, incidence 1 per 1000. In cases of more severe symptoms, this can be less reversible.26\nPrognosis: Most patients recover within 1 week. Relapses are common but tend to be milder than the original infection. Fatalities are rare.\nd.\nVibrio parahaemolyticus\nIt is not common in the United States, but worldwide this pathogen is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis.1\nTransmission: eating contaminated seafood, crabs, oysters, or clams or by exposure of an open wound to contaminated seawater (Gulf of Mexico). It has been transmitted through airline food.Pathophysiology: production of a heat-stable enterotoxin, inducing a secretory diarrhea and hemolysisIncubation: 6 hours to 4 daysDuration: self-limited up to 3 days, commonly 24 to 48 hoursSymptoms: abrupt onset of severe watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting are common symptoms. Fever occurs less commonly.Diagnosis: can be cultured on thiosulfate citrate\u2013bile salts sucrose if ingestion of contaminated seafood within 3 days before testing1\nTreatment: tetracycline \u00d7 3 days, ciprofloxacin \u00d7 1 dose, or chloramphenicol\ne.ShigellaPopulation: usually has an impact on children less than 5 years of age. It is rare in the United States.Transmission: consumption of contaminated food or water or by person-to-person or fecal-oral routePathophysiology: invades colonic epithelia cells; Shiga toxin causes inflammation and results in hemorrhagic colitis.1\nIncubation: 1 to 6 daysDuration: self-limiting, lasting 2 to 5 daysSymptoms: Fever, cramping abdominal pain, and diarrhea that is often bloody. Infants may not have bloody diarrhea.Treatment: ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day \u00d7 3\u20135 days), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160 mg twice a day \u00d7 3\u20135 days), or azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 3 days).Prognosis: Most patients recover in 1 week. Untreated patients shed bacteria in stool for 2 weeks. Relapse occurs in 10% of patients if not treated with antibiotics.\n\n\n",

They are also resistant to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, so caregivers must wash their hands in soap and water. Once in the colon, the bacteria become functional and produce toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin). Both toxins lead to inflammation, mucosal injury, and secretory diarrhea.31 Although toxin B is more virulent than toxin A, they both inactivate regulatory pathways, causing cell apoptosis, mucosal ulceration, and neutrophil chemotaxis to produce the pseudomembranes, common in this infection.32 Pseudomenbranes are composed of neutrophils, fibrin, epithelial debris, and mucin. Pseudomembranes are not found in all patients, for example, those with ulcerative colitis or who are on immunosuppressive agents, such as steroids or cyclosporine.33 The hypothesized reason for this is that pseudomembranes develop because of the host immunoreactions.33\n",

A complete blood cell count is nonspecific but, if eosinophils are elevated, a parasitic infection should be considered.1.Fecal leukocytes and occult blood: The presence of these suggests a bacterial cause of the acute gastroenteritis. The sensitivity of fecal leukocyte testing varies tremendously. A meta-analysis reported that at 70% sensitivity, fecal leukocytes were only 50% specific for an inflammatory process.36\n2.Fecal lactoferrin: Use when an inflammatory process is considered or when there is fever, tenesmus, or bloody stool. It is a more sensitive test for fecal leukocytes, because lactoferrin is a marker for fecal leukocytes, with sensitivity and specificity between 90% and 100%. Test is not readily available.5\n3.Stool cultures: The IDSA published guidelines for diagnosis and management of infectious gastroenteritis in 2001, but controversy remains as to when stool cultures are most useful. This controversy is not helped by the low rate of positive stool cultures.1\n\u25cbAccording to IDSA recommendations, stool cultures are appropriate if symptoms do not quickly resolve, if fever or bloody stool are present, if patients' comorbidities put them at risk for complications, or if patients are immunocompromised. Culture for Salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, E coli O157:H7 (also do Shiga toxin assay if blood in stool).\u25cbFood handlers may require negative cultures to return to work.\n4.\nC difficile assay: if hospitalized or if recent antibiotics or chemotherapy5.Stool ova and parasites: Generally, testing stool for ova and parasites is low yield and not cost effective. It is appropriate if symptoms and exposure history support a parasitic or protozoal etiology, bloody diarrhea without fecal leukocytes, or persistent diarrhea in day care centers or aer associated with a community waterborne outbreak. In these cases, 3 samples, taken on 3 consecutive days, should be sent to catch parasite excretion.\n",
