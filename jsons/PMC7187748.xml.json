            "text": "Despite our relatively large sample from multiple institutions, few children tested positive for hMPV, Flu, and combination infections, limiting our power to detect meaningful differences between these groups. In addition, due to the 2\u2010 to 3\u2010week sampling time frame at the 14 sites, the results do not represent the viral epidemiology of an entire bronchiolitis season at the site or regional level. Another potential limitation of this study is that some of the historical items (specifically wheezing and eczema) may not be accurate, because they were determined via parent interview, as opposed to evaluation by health professionals. There is, however, a similar potential for inaccurate reporting from study participants, and the differences between the children infected with RV compared to the other viruses are quite clear and often statistically significant. We did not collect other measures of atopy (e.g., nasal eosinophilia, radioallergosorbent test) from this cohort but will pursue this issue in future research. Although these findings are in children presenting to the ED for bronchiolitis and not necessarily generalizable to other clinical settings, it is possible that the children in our study are similar to those children with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe wheezing RV illnesses who do not present to the ED.\n13\n\n",

Moreover, children with RV bronchiolitis have an interesting clinical profile when compared to other children with bronchiolitis; children with RV bronchiolitis have demographics, medical histories, and ED treatments similar to those of older children with an asthma exacerbation. Future studies of children with RV bronchiolitis are needed to determine if identification of this virus is critical to guiding short\u2010 and long\u2010term treatment decisions (e.g., the initiation of oral and/or inhaled corticosteroids) to improve bronchiolitis outcomes.",
