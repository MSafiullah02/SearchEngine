Human rhinovirus (HRV), which causes the common cold, is the virus most likely to \u2022 trigger an asthma exacerbation. In contrast to the usual spring and summer temperate zone pollen season, viral infec-\u2022 tions begin to peak in the fall. The number, species, and typical course of viral respiratory tract infections that trigger \u2022 asthma vary with a person's age. Both acute sinusitis and asthma exacerbations are associated with viral respiratory tract \u2022 infection and therefore antibiotics are rarely needed in uncomplicated cases. Sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter in air pollution may \u2022 exacerbate asthma, and patients should be cautioned to stay indoors when levels of these irritants are high. Indoor air pollution, especially from tobacco smoke, can be reduced with benefit to the \u2022 asthma patient.",

And what causes my asthma suddenly to become worse?\" These questions have always been difficult to answer, and moving directly to a discussion of the management of asthma is a much easier road to take. In recent years, though, enough information has accumulated about the causes of asthma that one can weave a story containing useful advice that may help patients participate in the management of their disease. And there are also recent studies that can provide answers to the questions posed by physicians who have watched in puzzlement as their previously well-controlled asthma patients have spiraled rapidly out of control. This story has been growing increasingly complex, with an ever-expanding cast of players that sometimes creates a tangled web of interactions.",

The concept of causal agent, though, has a variety of different interpretations. In general, agents may act on the respiratory tract to initiate asthma or to exacerbate it. Initiation (or inception or development) of asthma refers to the start of asthma in a patient who was previously entirely free of this problem. An exacerbation (or trigger or precipitating event) means the significant and often sudden worsening of an established chronic asthmatic condition. Avoidance of a proven initiating factor, if possible, could permit the primary prevention of asthma. In contrast, avoidance of triggering events will not halt the disease but only decrease the number of exacerbations in someone who already has chronic illness. In studying and treating asthma, identification of a specific trigger is usually much easier than trying to prove an initiating cause.",

The path of system B illustrates how multiple stressors, including genetic factors and atopic immune development, may interact with a viral infection to cause a long lasting or perhaps permanent change in the level of mucosal inflammation.

A survey of school children in Ontario found that children presenting in September to the emergency department for asthma exacerbations, presumably mostly viral triggered, were less likely to have used preventive anti-inflammatory medications than their counterparts who did not have such severe exacerbations (12) . A retrospective study suggested that inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol administered prior to and during the fall could reduce the morbidity of the fall viral season in patients with asthma (13) . A trial of a montelukast added to usual asthma therapy was able to attenuate the fall asthma peak in one study (14) though this effect did not reach statistical significance in a later trial (15) . Inhaled corticosteroids might be expected to prevent viral-induced wheezing in children with minimal chronic disease as well. A preventive effect, though, has not been consistently shown in clinical trials. A study conducted in school-aged children without persistent disease but with a history of viral-triggered wheezing demon strated that inhaled beclomethasone diproponate was not superior to placebo in reducing future episodes. The inhaled steroid failed to reduce days with symptoms, or the frequency, severity, or duration of episodes of upper or lower respiratory illness (11) .

These children appear to benefit very little or not at all from acute or chronic corticosteroid therapy for viral-triggered wheezing illness (29) . At the other pole are children who wheeze daily or weekly, have an atopic history, have a parental history of asthma, and may be on chronic controller therapy. A viral infection in these children appears to be a trigger that requires a step up in asthma therapy, perhaps to a burst of oral corticosteroids. Between these poles of severity are many children whose therapy must be individualized. The criteria from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program help select preschool children who may benefit from acute and/ or chronic corticosteroids. These guidelines use the Asthma Predictive Index (30) to specify which wheezy small children have or likely will have chronic asthma and could benefit from various forms of inhaled and oral corticosteroid therapy.",

Sulfur dioxide can cause respiratory constriction in asthmatic patients at concentrations of 0.1 ppm when exercising (44) . Healthy adults begin experiencing increased airway resistance at 5 ppm, and even nonasthmatic adults will develop bronchospasm at 20 ppm, though these levels would be highly unusual in outdoor air pollution. Nitrogen oxides, and especially NO 2 , are also irritating to the upper and lower respiratory tracts at low levels, and patients with asthma are more susceptible to these adverse effects. Higher concentrations of outdoor NO 2 were associated with more asthma symptoms in a study of inner city children (45) .

Ozone from air pollution has been shown to exacerbate asthma in children and adults, though this effect may be greater in children (47) .
