            "text": "SUMOylation consists in the covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to specific lysine residues of a target protein. This conjugation is an enzymatic process that occurs in cascade. The precursor SUMO proteins are proteolytically processed to the mature forms, exhibiting their C-terminal diglycine motifs, by sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs). The resulting mature forms of SUMO are then activated by the SUMO-activating E1 enzyme (SAE1/SAE2). Subsequently, the SUMO molecule is transferred to the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, the only E2 SUMOylation enzyme discovered to date. Finally, the carboxyl group of the glycine residues at the SUMO carboxy terminus forms an isopeptide linkage with the \u03b5-amino group of a lysine residue on the target protein, a step that can be facilitated by SUMO E3 ligases. SUMOylation can be then reversed by SENPs. Usually, the target lysine for SUMO is located in the consensus sequence \u03c8KxE (where \u03c8 is a hydrophobic residue and x any residue) in the target protein, although SUMO can be also conjugated to lysine residues located in non-consensus sequences. Four different SUMO isoforms have been described in mammals (SUMO1 to SUMO4). SUMO1 protein is found mainly conjugated to targets due to its limited quantity and only shares 50% identity with SUMO2/3. SUMO2 and SUMO3 share 97% sequence identity and often are referred to as SUMO2/3, and its conjugation is stress-inducible [1]. SUMO4 remains poorly characterized and its physiological relevance is still unclear [2, 3]. The main function of SUMO proteins is to regulate protein\u2013protein interaction, which ultimately results in changes in protein subcellular localization or stability, transcription, DNA repair, innate immunity, or antiviral defense. Interestingly, many SUMO-modified proteins contain SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), allowing the noncovalent interaction of SUMO substrates with SUMO or non-SUMOylated proteins [4, 5].",

Once RIG-I is activated, it recruits the inhibitor of kB kinase (IKK) \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b5 through its interaction with MAVS, leading to the activation of NF-k\u03b2, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3, and IRF7, and consequently resulting in IFN\u03b2 and NF-k\u03b2 promoter activation. Frequently, the activation of both NF-k\u03b2 and IRF3/7 pathways by RIG-I in response to virus infection requires the NF-k\u03b2 essential modulator (NEMO), an adaptor protein that organizes the assembly of IKKs into activated high-molecular-weight complexes. Conjugation of SUMO2/3 to NEMO, a process downmodulated by SENP6, inhibits its interaction with the deubiquitinase CYLD strengthening the activation of IKK [7]. The noncanonical IKK kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which mediates the activation of IRF3, has also been shown to be a pivotal player in antiviral innate immunity, and its modification by SUMO supports its antiviral function, likely through contributing to adaptor binding for the transduction of antiviral signaling [8].",

In addition, SUMOylation of IRF3/7 in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) and RIG-I activation can act as a transcriptional repressor of IRF3 and IRF7, a mechanism that has been postulated to be part of the negative feedback loop of normal IFN signaling [12]. However, conjugation of SUMO to IRF3 not necessarily inhibits IRF3. Ran and colleagues found that SUMO can conjugate to K87 in IRF3, a lysine residue involved in IRF3 K48-ubiquitin conjugation and degradation [13]. Consequently, I IFN downmodulation of IRF3 SUMOylation induced by SENP2 promotes its ubiquitination, negatively regulating the virus-triggered type induction and cellular antiviral response [13]. Whereas PIAS1 has been reported to work as E3 SUMO ligase for both IRF3 and IRF7 [14], the repression of the ability of IRF7 to induce type I IFN transcription by SUMOylation has been shown to be promoted by TRIM28 [15]. Together, these studies show that SUMO plays an important role in the type I IFN expression in response to RNA virus infection.",

Thus, PML KO mice are more sensitive than WT to infection with different viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), or VSV, and cells from these mice are also more sensitive to infection with rabies virus [32\u201334]. In addition, overexpression of specific PML isoforms confers resistance to some virus infections. Thus, PMLIII protects against human foamy virus (HFV) [35], poliovirus [36], VSV, or influenza A virus [37], and PMLIV confers resistance to rabies virus and EMCV infection [34]. PML interacts with SUMO in a covalent and noncovalent manner. SUMOylation of PML is required for PML-NB formation and for promoting SUMOylation of specific substrates recruited on PML-NBs [38\u201340]. Moreover, modification of PMLIV by SUMO positively regulates IFN\u03b2 synthesis through IRF3 activation, and it is required for protecting cells from virus infection [41]. PML-III and PML-IV also recruit Ubc9 to PML-NBs, and this recruitment has been shown to be essential for the increase in global SUMOylation induced by IFN [42]. This is not the unique mechanism that contributes to the increase in global SUMOylation upon IFN treatment. Among the IFN-regulated proteins is Lin28B, a RNA binding protein that represses the expression of miRNAs from let-7 family [43\u201347] which targets SUMO transcripts [48].",

Five out of six of the viroplasms components, VP1, VP2, NSP2, VP6, and NSP5 proteins, are modified by SUMO; and three of them, VP1, VP2, and NSP2 proteins, also interact in a noncovalent manner with SUMO. SUMOylation of NSP5 has been shown to be essential for the formation of viroplasm-like structures (VLS) generated by overexpression of VP2 (VLS-VP2i). In addition, upregulation of SUMOylation positively modulates rotavirus replication and viral protein production, whereas interference of Ubc9 produces a marked decrease in the synthesis of viral proteins and virus titer [56].

Thus, an association between a cluster of host proteins involved in the SUMOylation process and the phosphoprotein (P) of the virus has been found after integration of proteome and transcriptome datasets [61]. In addition, SUMO seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of the virus [62]. The cellular damage and lung inflammation caused by RSV infection are associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, via degradation of the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (NRF2), which occurs in a SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin-ligase-RING finger protein (RNF4)-dependent manner [62].

Nodavirus replicate in the host cell cytoplasm. However, the capsid protein of nodavirus contains a nuclear localization signal that targets the viral capsid to the nucleus of infected cells [63]. Infection with the betanodavirus red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) induces the transcriptional upregulation of SUMO3, and SUMO3 overexpression increases IFN and ISRE promoter activity, suggesting that SUMOylation may play a role in the immune response of fish to viral infection [64].

SUMO modification of 3C has been proposed to be a host cell defense mechanism against virus replication and apoptosis induction during EV71 infection because SUMO-dependent ubiquitination of 3C was associated with reduced protease activity of 3C in vitro, increased degradation, decreased apoptosis induction and virus replication, and reduced EV71-elicited neurovirulence in a mouse model [68].",

Thus, treatment with the SUMOylation inhibitor 2-D08 has been reported to significantly reduce the replication of ZIKV in vitro in different cell types and in a dose-response manner [84].

The ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5 has a putative SIM domain that is highly conserved among Zika strains that is required for the NS5-mediated suppression of type I IFN signaling [84].

Furthermore, interaction between Ubc9 and the nonstructural proteins NS2B, NS4B, and NS5, as well as with the envelope protein E, was probed using a yeast two-hybrid assay [87, 88]. However, after evaluation of the putative SUMO1 modification of ten different DENV proteins, only SUMOylation of NS5 was demonstrated [85]. An intact SIM domain in NS5 was shown to be required for its SUMOylation, which protected DENV NS5 against proteasome degradation, supporting virus replication [84]. Interestingly, NS5 protein contains two functional NLS and is one of the DENV proteins that can be found inside the nucleus, where it interferes with cellular splicing [89]. Although Ubc9 was required for efficient replication of DENV, a study on type 2 dengue virus (DV-2) showed that overexpression of Ubc9 reduces the viral plaque formation in mammalian cells, likely due to the involvement of Ubc9 in the host defense system to prevent virus propagation [87].",

HCV infection upregulates SUMO1 expression, a host factor essential for HCV replication [91]. Ubc9 has also been shown to be required for HCV RNA replication [92].

The importance of NS5 SUMOylation for HCV was also supported by the constant reversion of the SUMO-defective mutant K348R of HCV NS5 to the WT sequence during virus replication [92].

In contrast, exogenous overexpression of PIAS2 decreased HCV core, NS3, and NS5A expression and the viral assembly and budding efficiency. When expressed together with SUMO1, PIAS2 induced the degradation of HCV core, NS3, and NS5A proteins expressed from individual plasmids and after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, PIAS2 interacts with and enhances SUMOylation of the core protein.

            "text": "Type I interferon induces the transcription of multiple genes leading to immunomodulatory effects. Among these IFN upregulated genes, there are SUMO proteins as well as multiple targets of SUMO, suggesting that SUMO may play a role in immunity. Viruses have evolved to exploit the SUMOylation machinery of the cell to improve their replication. Many viral proteins are SUMOylated or influence the SUMOylation of cellular proteins. Initially, most of the viral proteins evaluated as putative SUMO substrates were nuclear proteins of DNA viruses or RNA viruses replicating in the nucleus because SUMO and SUMOylation pathway components are localized mainly at the cell nucleus. However, in recent years numerous studies have demonstrated that cytoplasmic RNA viruses also exploit the cellular SUMO pathway. Although SUMOylation may contribute to the control of virus replication, SUMO seems to have an overall positive effect in most of the cytoplasmic RNA viruses. Thus, SUMO proteins or components of the SUMOylation pathway such as Ubc9 are required for the replication of some picornavirus, reovirus, nodavirus, and flavivirus and play a role in pnemovirus or flavivirus pathogenesis. In addition, SUMO conjugates to viral proteins from reovirus, paramyxovirus, picornavirus, coronavirus, arterivirus, filovirus, and flavivirus, and only a few examples of a negative effect of SUMO have been reported for members of the Flaviviridae, Arteriviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families. Interestingly, many of the viral proteins from cytoplasmic RNA viruses that are SUMO substrates can be detected at the cell nucleus during the viral cell cycle. Additional information will be required in order to determine whether there is a relationship between these two events.",

Conjugation of SUMO to NEMO inhibits its interaction with the deubiquitinase CYLD strengthening the activation of IKK and inducing an increase of type I IFN production [7]",

Conjugation of SUMO to p53, PML, and MxA promotes their antiviral activities. The regulation of the antiviral activity of PKR by SUMO may depend on the SUMO isoform [21\u201323]",
