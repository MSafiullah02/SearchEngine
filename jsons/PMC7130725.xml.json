            "text": "\nM. hyopneumoniae is extremely difficult to isolate because of its slow growth and interference with other swine mycoplasmas. The organism is primarily found on the mucosal surface of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles (Blanchard et al., 1992), and adherence of M. hyopneumoniae to the ciliated epithelium is a prerequisite for initiation of the infection. Zhang et al. (1995) identified the P97 protein to be a ciliary adhesin. Other adhesins may include a glycoprotein of 110 kDa (Chen et al., 1998), a P159 protein that is post-transitionally cleaved in proteins of 27, 51 and 110 kDa (Burnett et al., 2006) and a 146 kDa protein (Stakenborg et al., 2006). M. hyopneumoniae affects the mucosal clearance system by disrupting the cilia on the epithelial surface and, additionally, the organism modulates the immune system of the respiratory tract (Thacker, 2006). Therefore, M. hyopneumoniae predisposes animals to concurrent infections with other respiratory pathogens including bacteria, parasites and viruses. Limited information is available about the mechanisms which trigger the cilia damage. M. hyopneumoniae may increase the intracellular free calcium concentration in ciliated epithelial cells, which can induce loss of cilia (Park et al., 2002). A 54 kDa membrane protein of M. hyopneumoniae induced cytopathogenic effects in human lung fibroblast cell lines (Geary and Walczak, 1985). Epithelial cell damage may also be caused by the mildly toxic by-products of mycoplasma metabolism, such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals (Razin et al., 1998).",

It allows the producer to tailor environmental conditions to a uniform population of pigs and to clean the facilities between groups of pigs. AIAO production also results in better performance and less lung lesions in slaughter pigs. Mixing or sorting pigs is a source of stress to the animals and it increases the probabilities of disease transmission.

The risk for destabilization of the herd immunity especially increases in case purchasing of animals is performed at a regular basis, when replacement rates are high, or in case the animals originate from different sources. However, the pressure to improve genetics in high performing pig herds forces many pig producers to purchase their breeding stock. In these cases, it is important to evaluate the health status of the origin herd. Gilts should originate from a herd with a similar or higher health status, and a quarantine or adaptation period of at least 30 days should be respected (Amass and Baysinger, 2006).",

Crowding may lead to increased transmission of pathogens, and to stress reactions, making the pigs more susceptible to infectious diseases. Too low stocking densities are financially not justified. Therefore, it is important to find a reasonable compromise between stocking densities that are appropriate for the health of the pigs and those that maximize the returns on the building's cost. In general, the stocking density for finishing pigs on fully slatted floors should equal or exceed 0.7 m2 per pig (Madec, 1984).",

Biologically plausible reasons for a positive association between herd size and M. hyopneumoniae infections include a greater risk of introduction of the pathogen from outside the herd, greater risk of transmission of M. hyopneumoniae within and among herds when the herd is large, and effects of management and environmental factors that are related to herd size. However, compared with owners of small herds, owners of large herds might more frequently and more rapidly adopt management and housing practices that mitigate this potential increased risk (Gardner et al., 2002).",

Batista et al. (2004) found that, under standard hygiene protocols, M. hyopneumoniae was not transmitted to naive pigs by personnel who were in a weekly contact with infected pigs.",

This apparent contradictory situation is comprehensible by the fact that maximum beneficial effects of vaccination are reached several months after the initiation of vaccination (Haesebrouck et al., 2004). Meyns et al.

Results of these studies indicate a considerable variation among individual pigs, although proliferative responses in peripheral blood lymphocytes were more pronounced in vaccinated compared to non-vaccinated pigs. Conversely, suppression of T cell responses by thymectomy and treatment with anti-thymocyte serum resulted in decreased severity of microscopic pneumonic lesions after challenge, although the multiplication of M. hyopneumoniae organisms was enhanced compared to immune-competent pigs (Tajima et al., 1984). These findings suggest that the CMI may both help and hinder the development of mycoplasmal pneumonia. IFN-\u03b3, a cytokine produced by helper cells, subtype 1 (TH1) lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, has been shown to be important for macrophage activation. The generation of IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells in blood following vaccination might suggest that IFN-\u03b3 may also play a role in protection against M. hyopneumoniae through the activation of macrophages (Thacker et al., 2000a). Increases in concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, are thought to be associated with lesion development (Meyns et al., 2007) and to be one possible mechanism for the potentiation of PRRSV-induced pneumonia by M. hyopneumoniae (Thacker et al., 1999). Vaccination against M. hyopneumoniae reduced the potentiation of PRRSV-induced pneumonia by M. hyopneumoniae (Thacker et al., 2000c). This may be because the vaccine prevents an increase in lung TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in response to challenge with M. hyopneumoniae, thus impeding potentiation of PRRSV-induced pneumonia.",

Since infections with M. hyopneumoniae may already occur during the first weeks of life (Vicca et al., 2002, Sibila et al., 2007b), vaccination of piglets is most commonly used. Its efficacy has been demonstrated by means of numerous studies under experimental as well as field conditions (Jensen et al., 2002). Vaccination of suckling piglets (early vaccination; <4 weeks of age) is more common in single-site herds, whereas vaccination of nursery/early fattening pigs (late vaccination; between 4 and 10 weeks) is more often practiced in three-site systems where late infections are more common.",

Possible disadvantages of vaccinating piglets before weaning include the presence of maternal antibodies (see further) and an increased risk for more severe porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infections after weaning. Some studies have shown that administration of M. hyopneumoniae bacterins shortly before experimental/natural PCV2 infection increased the severity of PCV2 induced lesions/postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (Opriessnig et al., 2003). However, the potentiation of PMWS by certain vaccines is still a controversial issue since other studies (Haruna et al., 2006) concluded that routine vaccination against swine diseases, including M. hyopneumoniae infections, may not significantly contribute to the occurrence of PMWS under field conditions. It is likely that timing of vaccination in relation to PCV2 infection, among many other factors, plays a role in the influence vaccination has on the clinical outcome of this viral infection (Opriessnig et al., 2006).",

Vaccination of sows at the end of gestation aims to both reduce the shedding of M. hyopneumoniae from the sow to the offspring and to protect the piglets against infection via maternally derived immunity. It has been shown that vaccinating sows 5 and 3 weeks before farrowing was associated with a lower number of positive piglets at weaning using nested PCR on nasal swabs, both in farrow-to-finish operations and multi-site production systems (Sibila et al., 2006). However, maternally derived antibodies only provide partial protection against lesion development following challenge infection, and under experimental conditions, they provide limited to no effect on colonization of M. hyopneumoniae (Thacker et al., 2000b). The role of antigen-specific maternally derived immune cells in protection against M. hyopneumoniae is not known. Bandrick et al. (2006) showed in vivo response by delayed-type hypersensitivity and in vitro proliferation of maternally derived cells when newborn piglets were stimulated with M. hyopneumoniae antigen. Since piglets from vaccinated sows can still be infected, additional measures to control M. hyopneumoniae during the nursery and finishing phases may be warranted. Further research is needed to investigate the effects of sow vaccination on infection levels in pigs in different production systems.",

(1996) found only minimal and non-significant protection in a pig challenge infection model using a recombinant subunit vaccine based on the P97 adhesin of M. hyopneumoniae. Intranasal immunization of pigs with the attenuated Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae YS-19 strain expressing a recombinant protein of M. hyopneumoniae P97 adhesin significantly reduced the severity of pneumonic lung lesions following challenge infection (Shimoji et al., 2003). However, apparently significant humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were not observed in the immunized pigs. Okamba et al. (2007) showed that a replication-defective adenovirus expressing the C-terminal portion of M. hyopneumoniae-P97 adhesin applied intranasally and intramuscularly in BALB/c mice, induced significant immune responses. Also several experimental DNA vaccines have been developed and tested for immune responses in mice or pigs. Significant immune responses with DNA vaccines were elicited in mice, based on the expression of a heat shock protein gene P42 (Chen et al., 2003) or a ribonucleotide reductase R2 subunit gene fragment of M. hyopneumoniae (Chen et al., 2006). The studies suggest that these vaccines may represent new strategies for controlling M. hyopneumoniae infections in pigs, but they need to be validated in pigs under experimental and practical circumstances.",

Antimicrobials can be used in a flexible way, they are often effective against several (respiratory) pathogens and their administration is less labor-intensive since in-feed or in-water medication is mostly used. Vaccination, on the other hand, does not select for antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria and in bacteria belonging to the microbiota of the animal. It also avoids risks for antimicrobial residues in the pig carcasses at slaughter. While an immediate effect can be expected for antimicrobial treatment, the effect of vaccination of young piglets will only be evident at herd level if it is practiced for at least several months. Although vaccines are directed towards control of M. hyopneumoniae infections, also other secondary bacterial infections (Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae) or lung lesions caused by these pathogens less frequently occur after vaccination (Maes et al., 1998, Maes et al., 1999a, Maes et al., 1999b, Meyns et al., 2006).",

The total sanitation programme involved complete emptying of the animal facilities by selling or culling all animals. The partial sanitation programme included a piglet and gilt free (<10 months) interval and the temporary feeding of a medicated diet during 10\u201314 days. The feed contained either tiamulin (6 mg/kg body weight [BW]) or a combination of chlortetracycline (20 mg/kg BW), tylosin (4 mg/kg BW) and sulfadimidin (30 mg/kg BW). Once finished this medication period, the farm continues with its normal animal flow. The partial sanitation programme is well suited for small farms. In the US and Canada, large swine operations have developed a modified version of the Swiss method. The program includes the features of the partial depopulation scheme along with multiple vaccinations of the breeding herd and an offsite breeding program. The method is usually combined with herd closure when PRRSV elimination is also targeted.",
