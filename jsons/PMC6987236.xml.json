            "text": "The Banyangvirus genus, currently classified as part of the Phenuviridae family in the order Bunyavirales, is characterized by a tri-segmented, negative- or ambisense ssRNA genome of 11\u201319 kb length in total. Four structural proteins are encoded on the genome: the L protein (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) on segment L, two glycoproteins Gn and Gc on segment M, the nucleocapsid protein on segment N and the nonstructural protein NSs on segment S. Banyangviruses can infect vertebrates and invertebrates and have caused febrile infections, encephalitis and severe fevers with fatal outcome in humans, therefore being increasingly reported as emerging pathogens of public health importance1\u20133. Recently, two novel tick-borne phenuiviruses (Huaiyangshan banyangvirus [BHAV] and Heartland virus [HRTV]) were detected and characterized; they form, together with Guertu banyangvirus a new genus within the Phenuiviridae genus: the Banyangviruses clade1,2. BHAV was initially reported in 2011 in the Henan and Hubei Provinces, China. Patients showed fever or hemorrhagic fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia and multi-organ dysfunction with an initial case fatality rate of 30%1,4. By then, the etiological virus was isolated from patients\u2019 blood and Haemaphysalis longicornis and Rhipicephalus microplus ticks throughout China, South Korea and Japan5,6. Similar symptoms were recognized in two men from Missouri, USA. The respective virus, named Heartland virus (HRTV), was isolated in 2012 from patients\u2019 blood and Amblyomma americanum ticks collected in the field2,7. A third novel banyangvirus with close relation to BHAV and HRTV was detected in Tasmania State, Australia. The virus, named Hunter Island Group virus (HIGV), was isolated from Ixodes eudyptidis ticks which were blood-feeding on a shy albatross (Thalassarche cauta) colony with signs of unknown disease outbreak8. Despite the identification of ticks as vectors for BHAV, HRTV and HIGV, the amplifying or reservoir hosts of the viral pathogens remain unknown.",

Additionally, we have not found any evidence that ZbbV does encode for a NSm protein on segment M, this is corresponding with all other members of the genus Banyangvirus. As shown before, NSm is important for infectivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes15. However, although Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks are supposed to be the vector of BHAV, most infected patients did not report tick bites prior to disease onset1. Moreover, investigation of a cluster of BHAV cases suggests evidence of person-to-person transmission15, making the further study of BHAV- and BHAV-like viruses imperative regarding human public health.",

All bats in a broad study on diseases of native bats in Germany (n = 375) were found dead or moribund with subsequent euthanization and were kindly provided by bat researchers and bat rehabilitation centers16. 12 Eptesicus nilssonii bats collected throughout urban and suburban areas of Bavaria, showed potentially virus-related histopathological changes and have been further examined in this study.",

After obtaining the result that Zwiesel virus is related to SFTS virus (rated BSL-4 in Germany), further work on the original material was restricted to BSL-3. Homogenized organs [n = 31] with potentially virus-related histopathological changes (data available on request) were pooled (Table 1), followed by purification and enrichment of viruses directly from virus-infected tissue and subsequent deep sequencing of the virome17. Deep sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq. 1500 (Illumina Inc.) technology according to the Illumina sequencing protocol. Raw reads were trimmed for primers, adapters, low-quality bases and length (>30 bp)18. Sequences that mapped to RefSeq sequences of eukaryotes, fungi and bacteria using Bowtie 2 version 2.2.6 with default parameters were discarded. Remaining reads were de novo assembled using Velvet assembler 1.2.10 in default mode19,20. Contigs and remaining sequences were aligned to the NCBI RefSeq viral protein database using DIAMOND v0.7.121. All contigs and sequences with similarity to members of the genus Banyangvirus were assembled into larger contigs. The complete genome sequences of the L, M and S segments were obtained by using newly designed gap-filling PCR primers (sequence information available on request). Reagent concentrations were as follows: 5 \u00b5l of cDNA, 0.4 \u00b5M of each forward and reverse primer, 0.4 mM of desoxynucleoside triphosphates (Invitrogen), 2.5 ml of 10 \u00d7 Platinum\u00ae Taq buffer, 4 mM of MgCl2 and 1.25 U Platinum\u00ae Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) with water added to a final volume of 25 \u00b5l. Cycling conditions were 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, 45 amplification cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 45 s, 55 \u00b0C for 45 s, 72 \u00b0C for 45 s and a final extension for 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. Open reading frames of the viral genome were predicted with Geneious 7.1.4. (http://www.geneious.com; and ClustalW by aligning to annotated phenuivirus genomes as a ref. 22,23. Accession numbers of the L, M and S segments used for are indicated in the respective phylogenetic trees Figs. 1, 2 and 3). Specific qPCR primers were designed to determine the viral copy numbers within the organs tested positive and to screen pooled organ tissues of an additional 363 microchiropteran bats, moribund or found dead, from the broad study (BatBanyang F: 5\u2032ACTTCCAAAGCCACAAAAGATGGTA\u20323; BatBanyang R: 5\u2032CTGAAATCGCATTAAATGTTCCATTC\u20323; BatBanyang MGB: 5\u2032FAM CCTCCTAAGAAGAAATACT MGB\u2032316. Cycler conditions for qPCR were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, 45 amplification cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s and final extension for 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. Reagent concentrations were as follows: 1 \u00b5l of cDNA, 0.3 \u00b5M of each forward and reverse primer, 10 nM of probe, 0.1 mM of desoxynucleoside triphosphates (Invitrogen), 2.5 ml of 10 \u00d7 Platinum\u00ae Taq buffer, 5 mM of MgCl2 and 1.25 U Platinum\u00ae Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) with water added to a final volume of 25 \u00b5l.",
