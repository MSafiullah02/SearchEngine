This speculation may be solved by considering same study in vulnerable or underprevaledge communities.Several studies has reported 70-98% of the residents worldwide believed that SARS-2 can be successfully controlled or prevented, and 94.7-100% had confidence that we can win the battle against COVID-19. These results are similar to our findings on the rates of resident's confidence of winning in the battle against COVID-19. The optimistic attitude in our study could be attributed to the unprecedented COVID-19 control measures taken by the Government such as limiting public gatherings and other concerted effort across the country.The strength of this study lies in its large sample recruited during a critical period, the rise stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Nevertheless, compared to the population statistics, our sample was obviously middle and high economic societies due to the method used, we speculate that knowledge might have been over overestimated and attitude and practice underestimated. Community based national cross-sectional study is recommended when outbreak is over.",
