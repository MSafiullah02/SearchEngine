Development of more effective treatments is hindered by the lack of preclinical models of the human lung that can capture the disease complexity, highly heterogeneous disease phenotypes, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observed in patients. The merger of two novel technologies, Organs-on-Chips and human stem cell engineering, has the potential to deliver such urgently needed models. Organs-on-Chips, which are microengineered bioinspired tissue systems, recapitulate the mechanochemical environment and physiological functions of human organs while concurrent advances in generating and differentiating human stem cells promise a renewable supply of patient-specific cells for personalized and precision medicine. Here, we discuss the challenges of modeling human lung pathophysiology in vitro, evaluate past and current models including Organs-on-Chips, review the current status of lung tissue modeling using human pluripotent stem cells, explore in depth how stemcell based Lung-on-Chips may advance disease modeling and drug testing, and summarize practical consideration for the design of Lung-on-Chips for academic and industry applications.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The lungs constitute the largest tissue interface between the human body and its environment. Exposed to an average of seven liters of inhaled air per minute, lungs are in direct contact with countless noxious particles, viral or bacterial pathogens, hazardous chemicals or toxic gases. As formulated by Green et al., \"Each day a surface as large as a tennis court is exposed to a volume of air and contaminants that would fill a swimming pool\" [1] . Not surprisingly the lungs are susceptible to numerous deadly acute and chronic conditions that constitute an immense global health burden. Indeed, respiratory diseases are directly responsible for one in six deaths worldwide [2] , and chronic respiratory conditions affect more than one billion people worldwide [3] . In Europe alone, the total cost of respiratory disease amounts to more than \u20ac380 billion annually [4] . Among all respiratory diseases, five account for the majority of morbidity and mortality worldwide: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis, and lung cancer [5] . Recent reports suggest that onset or aggravation of respiratory disease caused by in-and outdoor air pollution, is responsible for 6.5 million deaths annually, a number likely to increase even further in the future [6] . It is therefore imperative to develop new therapeutic strategies for lung diseases, but this requires new tools to better study respiratory diseases and understand the underlying mechanisms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 445, "end": 448, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 677, "end": 680, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 764, "end": 767, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 868, "end": 871, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1091, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1312, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Studying lung disease pathogenesis and drug efficacy, as well as inhalation toxicology, necessitate physiologically relevant models of human lung tissue. While animals, especially rodents, have provided seminal insight into lung physiology and pathophysiology, they are limited in recapitulating the development, structure, disease symptoms, and responses of the human respiratory system, providing a strong rationale for developing and investigating human in vitro lung models for disease modeling, drug discovery, and drug testing [7, 8] . For instance, the timing of lung developmental events differs markedly between mice and humans. The prenatal saccular stage, in which alveolar sacs with distinguishable alveolar cell types form and surfactant secretion begins, takes place relatively earlier, and postnatal differentiation of immature saccules continues for a relatively longer time in humans compared to mice. This different pace of lung development results in a greater degree of branching and complexity of human distal lung structures including respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and associated alveoli [9] . Cellular composition also differs between mouse and human lung. For example, in the mouse airways, mucus-producing goblet cells are rare and secretory club cells (formerly known as Clara cells) are abundant, whereas the opposite applies to human airways [10] . Further, many gene mutations induce different, if any, respiratory symptoms in mice compared to humans [11] . While rodents remain the main animal model for pre-clinical studies, other non-rodent species such as guinea pigs, dogs, sheep, pigs and non-human primates which more closely mimic human lung physiology, are also used in preclinical studies. However, ethical and financial issues as well as non-availability of species-specific reagents often preclude their use for routine experimentation. Taken together, these limitations demonstrate that animals are imperfect models for a range of human lung diseases and their drug treatment, necessitating the need for human-specific preclinical models of the lung.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 533, "end": 536, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 537, "end": 539, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1123, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1384, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1490, "end": 1494, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Standard 2D culture of cancer or immortalized cell lines still represents the most common alternative to animal models for the study of tissue pathophysiology and response to pharmacological agents.

In the past 10 years, advances in tissue engineering and soft lithography techniques have converged to give rise to Organs-on-Chips, miniaturized microengineered cell culture systems that recreate key functional and microenvironmental features of human organs in vitro [12] . Importantly, the idea is not to rebuild an entire human lung with its intricate architecture as so far this remains technically not feasible and would also greatly complicate the experimental manipulation, analysis, and interpretation of the engineered system. Rather, the promise and great benefit of Organs-on-Chips lies in their ability to recreate well-defined functional units of the lung, such as the alveolar epithelium-blood capillary interface, or the mucociliary barrier of the airways.

While the lungs exert an essential but seemingly simple vital function by providing a constant supply of oxygen and removal of CO 2 through gas exchange between the inhaled air and circulating blood, lung morphology is complex and consists of distinct units with specific physiological roles.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 503, "end": 507, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modeling the human lung"}, {"text": "These units include regional sections that can be defined by their respective cellular composition and function, such as the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles or small airways, alveoli or air sacs, stromal connective tissue, blood vessels, and hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, and functional units such as the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit (EMTU) [15] or the alveolar-capillary interface (Fig. 1) . Together, these units build the organ's architecture and enable the process of gas exchange. Specifically, inhaled air enters the respiratory tract through the nasal and oral passages and flows through the conducting airways until it reaches the distal airways and alveoli. The conducting airways are composed of the trachea that divides into bronchi and bronchioles. The bronchioles lead to the alveoli that constitute most of the lung surface area and enable gas exchange with the circulating blood. The conducting airways are lined with highly specialized cells including ciliated cells, mucus producing cells called goblet cells, and club cells, while underlying basal cells act as progenitors. The relative proportion of these cells depends on their location in the respiratory tract [14, 16] . For instance, while club cells are almost nonexistent in the upper airways lining, they constitute a large part of the terminal and respiratory bronchioles cell population [16] . Similarly, goblet cells account for 10 to 15% of epithelial cells in large airways but are almost absent from terminal and respiratory bronchioles [16] . This characteristic cell distribution can be altered during chronic diseases. For example, increased goblet cells number in the airway lining has been observed in patients with obstructive respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD [17, 18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 351, "end": 355, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1196, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1200, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1379, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1533, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1774, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1775, "end": 1778, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 392, "end": 400, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Modeling the human lung"}, {"text": "The distal, respiratory part of the lungs contains an average of 450 million pulmonary alveoli constituted by thin, flat, non-dividing alveolar type 1 (ATI) cells that enable gas exchange, and small, cuboidal alveolar type 2 (ATII) cells that secrete pulmonary surfactant and can divide and differentiate to replace damaged alveolar cells [19] . In addition, the human lungs are home to numerous resident and circulating immune cells including macrophages, innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils that contribute to the protection from pathogens and noxious particles continuously entering the lungs Fig. 1 . Cell population diversity and location in human lungs and corresponding on-chip models. For each on-chip model, cell origin is indicated (L = human cell line; P = human-derived primary cells). [20] . Further, the submucosa surrounding the conducting and respiratory airway epithelium includes airway smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and neural cells that play major roles in health and disease [21, 22] . Sub-mucosal cells also play critical roles in many respiratory diseases. For instance, secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and hyper-responsiveness to external stimuli by airway smooth muscle cells contribute to tissue inflammation and lead to bronchoconstriction and airflow obstruction in asthma [23] . Similarly, uncontrolled activation of lung fibroblasts plays a central role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis [24] . The submucosa also harbors a network of blood and lymphatic vessels comprised of endothelial cells and pericytes that help recruit circulating immune cells during the inflammatory response. Hence, the human lung is a complex tissue comprised of numerous populations of cells that interact and depend on each other to grow and function properly [25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 339, "end": 343, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 838, "end": 842, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1059, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1063, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1372, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1492, "end": 1496, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1847, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 636, "end": 642, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Modeling the human lung"}, {"text": "The high diversity in cell types, numbers, function and tissue morphology among the different lung regions and disease states is an essential parameter to consider when designing an in vitro model of the human lungs and precludes a one-model-fits-all approach.

For instance, failure was reported for 18 out of 23 Phase II/III clinical trials testing 17 distinct therapeutic anticancer vaccines [28] due to elevated levels of circulating immunosuppressive cytokines and various immunological checkpoints in humans that may not be present in rodents [29] . Lung specific studies equally suffer from these limitations and over-reliance on animals to model complex human respiratory diseases such as asthma have contributed to the lack of new efficacious treatment despite huge research efforts, as animal models have a long record of failing to predict clinical efficacy of novel therapies in human [30] . This is also true for several other respiratory diseases, including cystic fibrosis. The DeltaF508 mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the most common genetic cause of human cystic fibrosis; however, mice with the DeltaF508 mutation do not have any respiratory abnormalities [31] . Also, investigations of human respiratory infections are hindered by the lack of human pathogen-specific receptor in animals. For instance, a majority of rhinovirus types uses human intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) as an entry receptor but cannot bind the murine form, precluding infection of mouse airway cells [32] , although transgenic mouse models expressing human ICAM-1 have recently been developed [33] . Animal models are often also not permissive for replication of human viruses [34, 35] .

Three dimensional cell culture usually relies on bioinspired scaffolds made of extracellular matrix (ECM) or synthetic polymers as well as specific growth factors or co-cultured mesenchymal cells which induce cells to polarize and differentiate into cellular structures resembling in vivo tissue morphology and function. When grown in ECM hydrogels, cells can self-assemble into 3D cellular clusters known as spheroids or organoids that contain multiple cells types resembling the organ tissue architecture and recapitulating some specific organ function [37] . Lung organoids derived from human primary lung tissues, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are also referred to as tracheospheres, bronchospheres, and pneumospheres (or alveolospheres), and have been successfully employed to study lung development and pathophysiology [19, [38] [39] [40] . Nonetheless, they also have limitations [41] ; organoids lack the native organ microenvironment and appropriate cyto-architecture that is often essential in disease development, tissue growth and repair. Another drawback of 3D organoid cultures is that analysis or stimulation of enclosed cells, particularly to measure transmembrane transporter activity, evaluate the transport and metabolism of drugs across the cell layer, or to quantify the release of inflammatory mediators or newly formed virions, is often precluded by the difficulty of accessing and sampling luminal contents. Also, exposing the organoids to uniform drug concentrations may be hampered by the slow diffusion and interference with the ECM hydrogel, or the technical difficulty of micro-injection into the luminal space. In addition, organoids usually lack tissue-tissue interfaces, such as the interface between vascular endothelium and surrounding stroma and parenchymal cells, which are essential for the morphology and function of virtually all organs. Finally, exposing epithelia to airborne substances to mimic environmental exposures or inhaled drug delivery is not readily feasible in organoid cultures. While it is possible to break up organoids and thereby expose their apical side to airborne substances, the mechanical forces used in the process, e.g. rapid pipetting and sudden changes in the media composition, may cause cellular stress and therefore alter responses. 3D models of the human airway epithelium based on air liquid interface cultures of primary epithelial cells in transwells inserts have also been shown to closely mimic the gene expression signature of the human airway epithelium in vivo [42, 43] and to recapitulate several hallmarks of human airway epithelium in vivo, leading to seminal insights into numerous biological processes in lung development and pathophysiology [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . However, as for organoids, these models typically lack physiological fluid and solid mechanical cues, including shear flow and tensile and compressive stresses that cells experience in vivo. The absence of fluid flow also prevents perfusion of cultured cells with circulating blood and immune cells and limits modeling of inflammatory responses to infection or drugs. Though relatively novel and not yet as familiar to investigators, the emergent field of Organs-on-Chips promises to overcome the limitations of traditional in vitro model systems by offering microengineered features such as dynamic stresses and microscale flows. Thus, combining the best attributes of stem cell assays and Organs-on-Chips technologies might enable the design of a more powerful in vitro model of the human lung.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 883, "end": 887, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1197, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1202, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1207, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1212, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1259, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2907, "end": 2911, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2912, "end": 2915, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3093, "end": 3097, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3098, "end": 3102, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 3103, "end": 3107, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 3108, "end": 3112, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 3113, "end": 3117, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3118, "end": 3122, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current in vitro models of the human lung"}, {"text": "Recent advances in microfabrication and tissue engineering have made it possible to create Organs-on-Chips -i.e., continuously perfused microchannels lined by living human cells.

In addition, cellular interactions can also leverage soluble factors, such as in epithelial-endothelial cross talk during influenza virus-induced cytokine storms [65] , endothelial influence on epithelial differentiation [66] , and mesenchymal cell influence on epithelial development [15] .

Similarly, stimulation of the epithelium with a pro-inflammatory agent results in activation of the underlying endothelium, as indicated by overexpression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin [52, 67] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 385, "end": 389, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 475, "end": 479, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 644, "end": 648, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 703, "end": 707, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 767, "end": 771, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1236, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1454, "end": 1458, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1459, "end": 1462, "text": "67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cell-cell interactions"}, {"text": "Despite extensive studies, the magnitude and nature of the mechanical forces experienced by the lung epithelial cells during development, breathing movements, and disease states are still not well understood and remain the object of intense research [68] .

The more recent denomination \"Organs-on-Chips\" implies the modeling of complex physiological organ-level function in microfabricated biochips. However, in place of silicon Organs-on-Chips are typically made from hydrogels [101] or a silicone elastomer called poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) which has played a central role in Organson-Chips sudden popularity [95, 102] . PDMS offers numerous mechanical and chemical advantages over traditional micro-engineering materials such as glass and silicon [103] . First, PDMS is relatively inexpensive compared to silicon, allowing cheap prototyping. PDMS stiffness can also be easily modified by controlling the degree of crosslinking between the polymer chains, enabling the design of soft and stretchable surfaces similar to the mechanical environment of cells. Moreover, since PDMS forms a tight seal with glass and can be reversibly or irreversibly bound to plastic polymers, hybrid devices containing rigid parts can be constructed. Importantly, PDMS is non-toxic and easy to work with, and rapid prototyping methods involving soft lithography and replica molding permit the creation of inexpensive devices with complex flow channel designs [102, 104] . Finally, PDMS is gas permeable, biocompatible and optically clear which makes it particularly well suited for growing living cells in enclosed fluidic microchannels and monitoring their behavior using various types of light microscopy. Faced with the promises and challenges of tissue engineering, notably the need for cellular scaffolds and blood perfusion of engineered in vitro tissue, researchers in the mid-nineties and early 2000s started to adapt microfabrication approaches to culture human cells and engineer human tissues [98] [99] [100] 105, 106] . Early attempts at cellular micro-patterning used PDMS microchannels sealed against a tissueculture dish to support the alignment, perfusion, and growth of 3T3-J2 fibroblasts [97] . Later, microfluidic designs were modeled to incorporate blood capillary-like channels to support the culture of human endothelial cells [107, 108] , quickly followed by other cell types, including liver [109] [110] [111] [112] , muscles [113] , bones [114] , brain [115] , gut [116] , and kidney [117, 118] .

Stucki et al. designed another version of an alveolus-on-a-chip that also supports a 3D cyclic deformation of human primary alveolar epithelial cells [80] . This study found that, compared to static conditions, cyclic stretch affects barrier permeability and increases the metabolic activity of primary alveolar epithelial cells and the release of inflammatory markers.

In this model, all sides of the vascular channel are coated with ECM and seeded with endothelial cells to prevent clotting of the perfused human whole blood. The study shows that treatment of the alveolar lumen of the epithelium-endothelium co-culture with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, triggered thrombotic events. Conversely, LPS stimulation of endothelial cells alone did not lead to blood clot formation, thus highlighting the importance of recapitulating the tissuetissue interface in a model of inflammation-mediated thrombosis.

For instance, the new \"small airwayon-a-chip\" recapitulates the human bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium by supporting the full differentiation of a columnar, pseudostratified, mucociliary, bronchiolar epithelium composed of human primary airway epithelial cells isolated from normal or diseased cells from patients. As in the alveolus model, the epithelium is underlined by a functional human pulmonary microvascular endothelium experiencing continuous fluid flow [52] . Human airway cells cultured on-chip at air liquid interface for three weeks reconstitute an in vivo-like epithelium composed of ciliated cells with physiological cilia beating frequency as well as goblet cells secreting mucus into the lumen resulting in robust mucociliary clearance [52] . Interestingly, the proportions of ciliated, goblet and basal cells inside the mature smallairway-on-a-chip are strikingly similar to those found in human lungs, suggesting that the reconstituted tissue closely recapitulates the morphology and functions of the human airway epithelium (Table 1) . Perfusion of IL-13 through the vascular channel to recreate a microenvironment enriched with inflammatory Type 2 T helper (Th2) cells as observed in allergic asthma resulted in significant airway remodeling with goblet cells hyperplasia, increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduction of cilia beating frequency. This phenotype was suppressed following incubation with Tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that blocks cytokine signaling, which is a therapeutic prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis [52] . Using primary airway cells derived from COPD patients, the small-airway-on-a-chip was also leveraged to investigate exacerbations in COPD, and to measure human neutrophil recruitment to the activated endothelium following epithelial exposure to pro-inflammatory stimuli. In addition, because the small-airway-on-a-chip has a separate air channel, it is possible to circulate air-borne pollutants through the epithelial chamber and evaluate, for example, the response of epithelial cells to cigarette smoke [126] . Recent advances in airway modeling also include a new on-chip model of viral-induced asthma exacerbations [125] . Derived from the original small airway-on-a-chip, this new chip supports infection of fully differentiated human airway epithelial cells with a human rhinovirus (HRV) to high titers and enables immune cell diapedesis through a 3 \u03bcm pore membrane. Stimulation with IL-13 altered HRV-induced proinflammatory and interferon responses and increased neutrophil recruitment to the vascular walls.

While cell lines are cost efficient and enable high-throughput studies, they are progressively being replaced by primary cells isolated directly from human or animal tissue as the biological relevance of cancerous or otherwise immortalized cells is increasingly questioned [132] . Primary cells offer a number of advantages compared to cell lines including recapitulation of original tissue characteristics, the ability to differentiate to in vivo-like tissue, preservation of donor disease phenotypes, increased predictiveness of human responses to drugs, control of cell source, and increased donor diversity to reflect natural diversity of human population. Nonetheless, primary cells also have important drawbacks. First, primary cells usually have a limited lifespan, although methods to prolong culture have been developed [133, 134] . Primary cells are also difficult and costly to genetically modify as transfection efficiency can be very low, hindering effective and economical gene editing approaches. Finally, primary cell diversity can also be an obstacle to long term in vitro studies as cells from the same patients are hard to obtain. Human stem cells on the other hand can overcome some of these limitations of primary cells. For instance, because adult stem cells can be maintained indefinitely and are easy to transform, functional gene studies are particularly straightforward and inexpensive. Stem cells from a single patient can also be used to recreate virtually any cell type. This possibility is exceedingly valuable when the primary tissue is difficult to isolate, such as alveolar epithelial cells. Stem cells are also advantageous when autologous co-cultures systems (i.e. cells obtained from the same patient) are needed, for instance to insure compatibility when culturing epithelial and T cells together. It is therefore important to consider replacing primary cells in Organs-on-Chips with stem cells, either by differentiating 2D cultures of stem cells on-chip or by directly seeding 3D organoids inside the chips. Furthermore, combining Organs-on-chips with stem cell technology would potentially enable features that are currently missing in lung organoids and other stem cell-based systems, such as the recapitulation of dynamic physicochemical stem cells niches, access to luminal and vascular compartments, dynamic immune cell circulation, and controlled application of physiological mechanical cues ( Table 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 408, "end": 413, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 964, "end": 969, "text": "[133,", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 970, "end": 974, "text": "134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2574, "end": 2582, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Modeling human airways pathophysiology on-chip"}, {"text": "Lung cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), particularly human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), hold great potential to build advanced in vitro models of human lung tissue and to further our understanding of lung physiology and disease.

While recreation of posterior endoderm cell derivatives that give rise to organs such as the liver, intestine, and pancreas became possible in the early 2000s [136] [137] [138] , anterior foregut endoderm induction leading to lung tissues was not achievable until more recently.

Following AFE establishment, a ventral patterning step is needed mirroring the morphogenesis of the endoderm where the trachea and lung buds eventually emerge ventrally [141] . AFE ventralization is largely achieved through WNT, BMP, retinoic acid and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling [66, 139] yielding cells expressing transcription factor NKX2-1, the major marker for lung epithelial lineage (in addition to neural and thyroid tissue fate) [142] .

The combination of glucocorticoids, growth factors, and cAMP effectors (dexamethasone, 8-br-cAMP, IBMX, and KGF/FGF7; collectively known as DCIK) [144, 145] has been shown to induce alveolar maturation through activation of PKA and CDP-choline pathways which upregulate lamellar body surfactant production in ATII cells [146] . Recognized markers of the distal alveolar epithelium include Surfactant Protein C (SFTPC), Surfactant Protein B (SFTPB) HTII-280, ABCA3, and LAMP3/DC-LAMP for ATII cells, while Podoplanin, Caveolin (CAV1), and Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) primarily define ATI cells. Stimulation of two dimensional cultures of differentiated PSCs growing in 2D with DCIK, FGF10 and WNT activators leads to expression of ATI and ATII markers, mature phenotypic characteristics of lamellar bodies, and functional surfactant uptake capability [147] . Similarly, PSCs spheroid cultures also induce cell maturation of the alveoli epithelium. Interestingly, 3D co-culture with human fetal lung fibroblasts and stimulation with DCIK yielded ATII specific markers and lamellar bodies formation, although functional maturity was not confirmed [148] . Functional lamellar bodies through BODIPY-labeled SFTPB uptake was later shown by first generating PSC lung bud organoids, followed by Matrigel culture with a WNT activator, FGF10, KGF, BMP4 and RA in place of DCIK. ATII markers were found to be abundant in this protocol while ATI markers were minimally expressed [40] . Advanced maturation of ATII cells characterized by the capacity of lamellar bodies to process surfactant proteins and produce dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) surfactant phospholipid was demonstrated by maturing NKX2-1 + cells in Matrigel with DCIK and temporally modulating WNT activity.

By closely recreating the spatiotemporal dynamics and heterogeneity found in the lung, Lung-on-Chip models may also be useful for appropriate differentiation and maturation of stem cell-derived lung cells. Indeed, chemical signals, structural cues, ECM, and additional cell types have all been shown to enhance maturation of lung epithelial PSCs: implantation into injured mice, scaffolding using decellularized lung matrix, or multi-culturing with lung mesenchyme and fibroblasts have led to the development of lung epithelia of all fates [40, 148, 156, 157, 159, 161, 163, 164] .

The first 100 lung disease-specific iPSC lines were generated, including lines from individuals with cystic fibrosis and \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, the two most common monogenic lung diseases [167] . Immediate research applications of these diseasespecific cell lines include probing the relative contribution of somatically acquired versus genetic risk factors, genetic engineering to induce or repair putative disease-causing mutations, the comparison of tissues derived from patients and their healthy relatives, and the study of both disease pathology in different genetic backgrounds and their response to drugs [168] . Direct consequences for clinical research are imminent: because stem cells are derived from a specific patient, analysis of their response to various stimuli or drugs should predict individual patient responses. For example, if a compound improves a specific function in a model using iPSC derived from a patient, the same result may be achieved in the patient. Conversely, if adverse drug effects are identified in human iPSC-derived tissues with a specific genetic background, it might predict drug failure in the clinical trial for this subset of patients. In monoculture, iPSCs are most suitable for investigating monogenetic diseases that have complete penetrance and well-defined cellular phenotypes caused by the mutation (cell-autonomous disease), such as cystic fibrosis cells with mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which impair chloride ion transport in cells that express CFTR.

This advancement would have been impossible without the development of a host of preclinical assay in animal and traditional cell culture models [172] . However, there remains a lack of suitable model systems for certain mechanisms, including the predominant cause of pulmonary decline in CF patients, the infection with biofilm-forming phenotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that emerge in the CF lung [173] . Mice with deletion of the CFTR gene do not develop the spontaneous lung disease or chronic bacterial infections seen in humans [174] and, unlike humans, CFTR mutant mice appear to have alternate chloride ion channels compensating for dysfunctional transport by CFTR [175] . Recent development of pig and ferret models of CF alleviate some of these limitations and have been shown to recapitulate key aspects of CF in humans, including persistent bacterial infection of the lung [176] , however, these animal models do not replicate the highly specific association with P. aeruginosa seen in human patients, and are unlikely to support genotype-phenotype studies for most of the 2000 mutant CFTR alleles known to impair synthesis, trafficking, stability and/or ion gating function of CFTR [177, 178] .

Both conditions engender respiratory distress and chronic inflammation of the lung and are thought to result from environmental exposure in genetically susceptible individuals [193, 194] . The symptoms can be further exacerbated by airborne particles, or viral and bacterial infection of the airways. Currently, there are many treatment options for managing severe asthma and COPD; however no treatments reduce disease progression [195, 196] . To advance this research, a plethora of model systems has been developed over multiple decades, ranging from very simple models using human cells (e.g. bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts) in mono-or co-culture, whole tissue explants (biopsies, muscle strips, bronchial rings) to in vivo studies in animals or in humans [197] . While these platforms cover substantial grounds, the addition of dynamically perfused, patient-specific microtissues could help dissect the contributions of environmental factors, genetic predispositions, and acquired susceptibility. In fact, animal models do not naturally develop asthma [36] , and even when they can be rendered sensitive to antigens, they fail to recapitulate all aspects of the human pathogenesis [198] [199] [200] . This is likely due to well-known differences in airways physiology, anatomy, and immunology between animals and humans [201] [202] [203] . For instance, secretory goblet cells are increased in size and number in COPD and asthmatic airways; this pathological hyperplasia is likely mediated by Notch signaling-directing differentiation of basal cells, the stem cells of the large airway, towards a secretory fate [204] . Mice, however, exhibit a much lower abundance of goblet cells than humans and therefore do not provide a good model for development and homeostasis of goblet cells in healthy and diseased human lungs. Traditional cell culture models using airway epithelial cells from asthmatics [205] or mimicking asthma by exposing normal epithelial cells to asthma-associated cytokines such as IL-13 [206] , have helped reveal the role of inflammation and the innate immune system in asthma [207] , however, the spatiotemporal dynamics of this process cannot easily be studied in either static culture nor in animal systems. Also, the origin of pathological inflammatory responses might be found in developmental events that are human-or even patient-specific, such as in utero fetal programming of gene expression involved in lung development [208] , or signaling from the microbiome during a critical postnatal time window thought to promote immune tolerance [209] . Human primary cell 3D models of the airways have demonstrated a new avenue towards addressing these and other questions in vitro [52, 210] .

Small airway epithelium derived from stem cells of cystic fibrosis patients can be used to study universal cystic fibrosis disease mechanisms as well as the role of specific CFTR mutations within the context of the dynamic micro-environment at the blood-mucus-air interface. For example, the chip can be used to study A, the interaction between PMNs, biofilm-producing bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, and antibiotics treatment; B, the sensitivity and patient-specificity of new and established markers of lung function, including transepithelial potential difference, mucociliary clearance, and biomarkers of inflammation; and C, the efficacy of delivery and action of drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients, such as CFTR modulators and antibodies. patients is clear evidence of a genetic predisposition [211] . IPF is a particular severe form of pulmonary fibrosis with a progressive decline in lung function, that causes the death of 80,000 US Americans and Europeans each year [212] . To date no therapy is available to reverse the disease process. In the recent years, two pharmaco-therapeutic agents, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been developed that can halt disease progression, however use of both drugs is associated with adverse effects [213] . While the precise disease mechanisms are still unknown, it is believed that myofibroblasts and fibrosis progenitor cells are responsible for the fibrotic architectural remodeling in the lung [63, 214] . Altered mucociliary properties could also contribute to the disease process by reducing clearance of noxious agents from the epithelium [215] . Several genetic polymorphisms and mutations predispose to IPF but how the fibrotic process is initiated and sustained remains unclear, partly because no good mouse model of the disease exist, leading to poor preclinical to clinical translation and extensive clinical trial failures [216] . Patient-specific in vitro models of the human alveolar epithelium are urgently needed to help elucidate the pathogenesis and role of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure in determining disease penetrance [214, 217] . Specifically, on-chip model comprising the different cell types of the alveolar epithelium, ideally from the same patient, and recapitulating the cross talk between alveolar epithelial cells and the surrounding fibroblasts could reveal unknown mechanisms of pathogenesis and lead to new therapeutic targets.

Development of drug-resistant tumor cells and eventually fatal metastases is common despite aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, and long-term survival rates of lung cancer patients remain low [219] . Clearly, new treatment strategies are needed. Approaches that elicit anti-tumor immune responses such as antibody-based immune checkpoint receptor inhibitor therapy [220] or enhanced T-cell activation using gene editing [220] have raised great hopes; however, in many cases preclinical efficacy does not translate to human trials. For example, in some cases, immunologic response was not correlated with survival [221] . Perhaps more concerning, in recent phase II/III clinical trials, nearly 80% of all the studies failed [28] due to elevated levels of circulating immunosuppressive cytokines and various immunological checkpoints in humans that may not be present in animal models [29] . Indeed, there is a lack of human-relevant model systems where tumor biology in response to treatment and immune responses can be observed and quantified. Conventional subcutaneous implants of tumor tissue in mouse models do not mimic organ-specific differences in cancer growth or responses to drugs observed in the clinic [222] . Notably, human tumor xenografts implanted in mice at the corresponding organ site from which the tumors were derived are better at recapitulating physiological tumor growth and metastasis [223, 224] . These results indicate the importance of the organ-specific microenvironment in determining tumor biology and drug response; however, the contributions and spatiotemporal dynamics of the tumor-organ interactions have remained a \"black box\" because of the difficulty to visualize and probe tumor development in vivo. Conventional 2D in vitro cancer cultures, on the other hand, are amenable to real time imaging and investigation and have been the workhorse for studying molecular mechanisms of cancer, providing high throughput and direct comparison of experimental results with a wealth of literature and online data [225, 226] . However, there is evidence that the 3D architecture of real tumors might lead to different growth profiles and drug responses, and this has driven the development of 3D cancer cultures [227] . Extending these approaches to include the organ-specific microenvironment and heterogeneous cell populations, Organ-on-Chip models of human lung cancer provide an alternative approach by recapitulating the organ-specific 3D microenvironment, tissue-tissue interfaces, mechano-chemical cues, vascular perfusion and potential interactions with immune cells while also enabling continuous monitoring of tumor evolution and tumor-organ interactions [124] .

Third only to stroke and cardiovascular disease, lower respiratory infections constitute the most deadly communicable diseases, causing 3.2 million deaths in 2015 [2] . Tuberculosis and other bacterial diseases, together with influenza, as well as diseases caused by respiratory syncytial viruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses and coronaviruses, can cause life threatening conditions in healthy people. Even otherwise harmless infections can cause complications in patients with pre-existing lung diseases such as asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, or primary immunodeficiencies, and other conditions that alter immunologic mechanisms against microbial invasion [229] . Susceptibility to infection as well as onset, duration and severity of symptoms is controlled by dynamic and patient-specific host-microbe interactions which, in addition to the rise in antibiotic resistance, has contributed to the difficulty of developing effective treatments [230] [231] [232] . Lung homeostasis relies on a finely regulated balance between immune tolerance towards innocuous exogenous particles that continuously enter the lungs on the one hand, and defense mechanisms against infectious agents on the other hand. An imbalance in immune homeostasis of the lung can lead to exaggerated inflammatory responses such as allergies or a \"cytokine storm\" following viral infections which can lead to extensive tissue damage [233] . Respiratory infection pathogenesis is largely mediated by the interaction between the infected tissue and the host immune system, including lung resident and circulating immune cells. While most in vitro systems enable the study of isolated immune cells or epithelial cells in static conditions, human Lung-on-Chip models are dynamic fluidic systems that offer the unprecedented possibility to investigate interaction of lung endothelium and epithelium with the ability to flow immune cells in a dynamic fashion through lung capillaries. This unique feature can be leveraged to dissect individual roles of infiltrating immune cells in lung infection, to probe underlying disease mechanisms and to identify new therapeutic targets or facilitate vaccines development. Disease phenotypes are also modulated by more subtle interactions with the patient's resident immune cells. For example, pathogenesis of the tuberculosis causing bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis involves modification of core cell signaling pathways in immune cells and differences in patient-specific immune cell responses may explain why responses to infection are highly variable between patients [234, 235] . Hence, both the development of novel, host-directed therapies as well as understanding the mechanisms of disease onset and progression in tuberculosis would benefit from patient-specific in vitro models of the dynamic interactions between bacteria, lung cells, and the immune system [236] [237] [238] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 282, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 818, "end": 823, "text": "[229]", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1109, "text": "[230]", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1115, "text": "[231]", "ref_id": "BIBREF232"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1121, "text": "[232]", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1568, "text": "[233]", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}, {"start": 2740, "end": 2745, "text": "[234,", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 2746, "end": 2750, "text": "235]", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 3036, "end": 3041, "text": "[236]", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 3042, "end": 3047, "text": "[237]", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 3048, "end": 3053, "text": "[238]", "ref_id": "BIBREF239"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pulmonary infectious disease"}, {"text": "Preclinical drug discovery and development process involves testing of drug's safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics (including drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), as well as potential drug-drug interactions.

Adverse effects can be idiosyncratic or due to a toxic reaction of the drug or one of its metabolites, since the lungs metabolize certain substances. In addition, secondary mechanisms such as immune system responses can cause further damage.

DILD is thought to be caused by direct, dose-dependent cytotoxicity to bronchial epithelial cells or the alveolar capillary endothelium, but also by a T-cell mediated immune response.

Furthermore, inhalation of toxic gaseous airborne substances remains an important cause of lung injury through occupational exposure and, in some parts of the world, chemical warfare. For many toxic gases, mechanistic understanding and specific treatment options for acute and chronic injury are lacking, and human in vitro inhalation models of gas toxicity would address an unmet need [245] . The in vitro modeling of inhalation toxicity is particularly challenging because no standardized procedure for delivering airborne toxins and gases to an air-liquid interphase exist, let alone for incorporating the effects of breathing flow dynamics.

Categorizing the disease in this way could facilitate the design of patient-specific and stage-specific therapies and advance personalized respiratory medicine [255] . In the simplest application, systems-biology-based disease definitions can help address questions such as whether a new drug should be developed and tested in a broad disease category, such as COPD, or focus on specific disease phenotypes. In particular, even if patients exhibit similar symptoms on the clinical level, the molecular factors driving disease progression can be different, and vice versa [256] .

Of particular interest is the development of imaging markers and biomarkers that are sensitive to different stages of airway disease, demarcate early-stage lung disease, and group patients into distinct phenotype or endotype populations. Towards these goals, Lung-on-Chip models provide a system to identify dynamic morphological, soluble, genetic and 'omics' markers that could be integrated with clinical readouts from blood tests, biopsies, imaging, patient-reported outcomes and clinical endpoints, such as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ). Such multidimensional disease signatures would then support the design of endpoints that can be measured both in vitro and in the clinic which are directly related to disease progression and drug efficacy [258, 259] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 877, "end": 882, "text": "[258,", "ref_id": "BIBREF259"}, {"start": 883, "end": 887, "text": "259]", "ref_id": "BIBREF260"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Efficacy of pulmonary drugs"}, {"text": "Inhalation is an attractive route for drug delivery because its large surface area (70-140 m 2 in adults), good vascularization, and thin alveolar epithelium offer the potential for rapid absorption of pharmaceuticals either for local deposition or for systemic delivery [260] [261] [262] . There is also great interest in the development of inhaled drugs for localized treatment of lung diseases, including pneumonia [263] . However, accurate pulmonary drug delivery is not a trivial task because of the complex mechanical, chemical, and biological pharmacokinetics (PK) mechanisms at play, including drug deposition, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and various clearance mechanisms. The first step, drug deposition, depends mostly on the fluid-mechanics of lung morphology, breathing pattern, aerosol velocity, particle size and density. Only part of the dose will reach the target site in the lung whereas a significant fraction can remain in the inhalation device or be deposited in the mouth and throat. Due to the large spatial scales involved, understanding and predicting initial drug deposition relies on computational models and perfused animal lungs [264, 265] . Organ-on-Chip models have great potential, however, to aid modeling of many aspects of drug fate following deposition in different regions of the lung; this is in addition to providing insight into region-specific pharmacodynamic activity due to varying target expression and density throughout the lung. Specifically, for pulmonary absorption into tissue and blood circulation to occur, deposited drug particles have to (i) dissolve in the surface lining fluids, (ii) overcome various defense mechanisms by which the lung clears inhaled particles, including mechanical (i.e., mucociliary clearance), chemical (e.g., surfactant lipids, antiproteases), and immunological (e.g., phagocytosis) responses, (iii) pass the transepithelial air-blood barrier by passive diffusion or carrier-mediated active transport via paracellular or transcellular pathway, and (iv) withstand (or be activated by) the lung's metabolic activity [264] . The relative role of these mechanisms in drug absorption varies depending on airway region. For example, the conducting airways (nasal cavity, sinuses, nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles) are lined by ciliated cells and mucus-secreting cells, which together enable the mucociliary clearance of about 90% of inhaled particles, greatly reducing bioavailability of drug compounds [266] . In the respiratory regions, on the other hand, which comprise about 95% of the total surface area and consist of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs, drug bioavailability is limited by absorption, transport across the pulmonary air-blood barrier, and metabolic and macrophage clearance [267] . Because of the complexity of the lung morphology, the quantitative characterization of the in vivo interplay of all contributing factors either with in vitro assays or with in silico methods is an ongoing challenge. For example, rodents are generally exposed intratracheally or via nose-only inhalation, and hence the resulting plasma pharmacokinetics are a result of absorption from different regions of the lung [268] . Computational modeling approaches attempt to derive PK parameters mechanistically based on the physico-chemical characteristics of the drug (e.g., aqueous solubility) and the anatomical and physiological tissue properties, or, alternatively, from clinical PK data by means of statistical correlation; these approaches are limited by preexisting knowledge and data. Recently, there have also been microfluidic approaches to studying the dynamics and deposition of particles in true-scale, but cell-free, physical models of the pulmonary acinus which can help to isolate purely mechanical mechanisms [269] . Stem-cell based Lung-on-Chip models could complement these approaches and enable the empirical measurement of PK parameters of drug absorption at the cellular and tissue level. For example, local drug dissolution could be measured, which, especially for lipophilic drugs, can represent the rate-limiting process for pulmonary absorption. Further, temporal dynamics and patient-specific conditions can be revealed by recapitulating organ-specific barrier functions such as endothelial cell junctions and electrical resistance, presence of specific membrane transporters and metabolic enzymes, genotypic variation, disease conditions, and drug-drug interactions. Also, the effect of elimination processes such as mucociliary clearance on pulmonary bioavailability could be measured [270] . In addition, the flow environment of Organs-on-Chips enables the realistic test of time-dependent effects such as built-up of drug residue or drug carriers that can cause local toxicity [271] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 276, "text": "[260]", "ref_id": "BIBREF261"}, {"start": 277, "end": 282, "text": "[261]", "ref_id": "BIBREF262"}, {"start": 283, "end": 288, "text": "[262]", "ref_id": "BIBREF263"}, {"start": 418, "end": 423, "text": "[263]", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1172, "text": "[264,", "ref_id": "BIBREF265"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1177, "text": "265]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2107, "text": "[264]", "ref_id": "BIBREF265"}, {"start": 2519, "end": 2524, "text": "[266]", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}, {"start": 2836, "end": 2841, "text": "[267]", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 3258, "end": 3263, "text": "[268]", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 3864, "end": 3869, "text": "[269]", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 4652, "end": 4657, "text": "[270]", "ref_id": "BIBREF271"}, {"start": 4846, "end": 4851, "text": "[271]", "ref_id": "BIBREF272"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pulmonary drug delivery"}, {"text": "The two principal challenges involved in the design and engineering of Lung-on-Chip models suitable for reproducible and scalable research are (i) to build the biology, i.e., to decide on the cells, ECM elements and the dynamic microenvironment that together enact the desired structure-function relationships of the organ [272] , and (ii) to build the chip hardware, i.e. to identify materials and geometries supporting study and maintenance of tissue biology that are at the same time amenable to reliable batch fabrication and application (Fig. 6 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 323, "end": 328, "text": "[272]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 542, "end": 549, "text": "(Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Practical considerations and challenges of Lung-on-Chips engineering"}, {"text": "As discussed in great detail before, the main components determining the biology of the system are cell types, sources and architecture, ECM composition and distribution, and biomechanical forces such as flow shear and tissue strain.

Together, these criteria are difficult to achieve. For example, as discussed earlier, PDMS has been the material of choice for many proof-of-concept Organs-on-Chips designs; however, despite all its advantages for rapid prototyping, its use is sometimes limited by its tendency to absorb specific small hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds, encouraging the development of new, non-absorbing Organson-Chips materials [274] . Similarly, chip geometry constitutes a major factor in providing a physiologically-relevant environment amenable to sampling.

Broader accessibility of the technology and increased experimental throughput will enable the translation of this technology to pharmaceutical industry and clinical decision making.
