The same experts separately analyzed the paired radiographs (acute and convalescence) of these patients. Pneumonia was diagnosed only if both experts independently reported a pulmonary infiltrate in the acute phase radiograph that disappeared or retreated significantly in the follow-up radiograph. Those cases in which the two experts did not agree were not considered pneumonia for the purpose of the study. In patients who died in the hospital, pneumonia was diagnosed if the presence of a typical infiltrate on hospital admission was seen on chest radiograph that was not present in a previous radiograph. At the data analysis phase of the study, the patients were divided into the CAP or NPLRTI groups according to the presence or absence of pneumonia. None of the patients in the NPLRTI group underwent chest CT scan, so negation of CAP was based solely on chest radiographs. In the majority of patients with NPLRTI, the indication for hospitalization was decompensation of chronic comorbid disease and deterioration in an elderly patient's general condition due to the infection. A minority of patients were hospitalized for social reasons.",

Five studies have been reported over the past 4 years that investigated the proportion of viral respiratory infections in adult patients with CAP using NAAT.2, 3, 4, 5, 6 None of those studies included a control group of subjects without evidence of respiratory infection. The authors of each study cited a lack of this type of control group as a significant limitation of their study. A valid comparison with a healthy control group is necessary to assess the significance of the proportion of RV among patients with CAP. Another comparison group that was included in our study was patients hospitalized with NPLRTI. The reason for including this group was that, based on our previous studies,12, 13 we expected the proportion of viruses in these patients to be significantly higher than in patients with CAP, an assumption that was confirmed in the present study.",

In our recent study,11 in which the present study population constituted the majority of that population, we found that the sampling method has a significant effect on the proportions of RVs identified. NPW yielded significantly higher proportions than OPS and NPS, but only the combination of all three sampling methods identified all the RVs.

However, the identification of 32 RVs in 7.1% of the control subjects is an important finding. In light of this finding, it is reasonable to assume that only in approximately 25% of patients with CAP (the difference between 31.7% and 7.1%) can a significant involvement of RVs in the disease process be claimed. This interpretation of the results also holds for each of the specific viruses that were identified with varying differences between patients with CAP and control subjects. The overall proportion of viruses among patients with NPLRTI, which was significantly higher than among patients with CAP, could be attributed mainly to influenza viruses that were identified in 31.3% of patients with NPLRTI. On this issue, it is noteworthy that our study population included patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in whom we looked for viral etiologies. Thus, a patient with a clinical picture of LRTI diagnosed as influenza virus based on polymerase chain reaction findings was considered by us to be a patient with LRTI with an influenza etiology.",

These three viruses are absent from the list because their involvement and importance in CAP9 only has been recognized in recent years with the expanded use of NAAT. Falsey et al15 in 2002 and van Elden et al16 in 2004 were the first to identify rhinovirus and coronaviruses in nonimmunocompromised adults with CAP. The proportion of 18% for this combination of viruses seen in our study is higher than the corresponding proportions of 4%, 7%, 9%, and 15% found in four of the five studies cited previously2, 3, 4, 6 and significantly lower than the outlying proportion of 30% found in the fifth study.5 These high-prevalence proportions strongly highlight the need for the development of safe and effective antiviral agents for these two viruses, a need that also was cited in previous publications.17, 18, 19\n",

In contrast to previous studies, this study ignored nonviral etiologies for CAP, which raises the question about whether the virus identified in the patients with CAP was the sole etiology for CAP or whether bacterial and atypical etiologies could have been identified as well in these patients and may have caused the clinical presentation and course of the disease. Because we did not evaluate bacterial and atypical etiologies, we cannot relate to possible associations between the RV identified in individual patients and the clinical course and outcome of CAP.",

It is possible that this limitation of our study affected the results and should be taken into consideration when comparing them to those of the five studies described herein, all of which were conducted continuously over all seasons of the year. Another methodologic limitation is the exclusive use of NAAT without regard for other traditional methods, including serology, viral cultures, and immunofluorescence. Although each of those methods is less sensitive than NAAT, it is possible that testing of our samples by other methods would have increased the proportion of viruses identified in our study population. During the planning stage of the present study, we were well aware of these limitations. The inclusion of the two comparison groups made the study population much larger than similar studies in the past. Furthermore, the decision to use three sampling methods increased the number of samples tested threefold. Given this magnitude of patients and samples, the study could only be conducted within the limitations discussed here.",
