            "text": "1972). Smith at el. (1975) and Jacobs and Edington (1971) do not seem to have been any more fortunate. BRS virus causes the culture to form syncytia, with a very variable number of nuclei. The disappearance or bursting of these giant cells leaves vacuoles in the cell layers. Staining with haemalum-eosin reveals a predominance of circular inclusions and markedly fewer polymorphs than in PI-3 virus infection. BRS virus in cell cultures is revealed by staining the viral antigens with a labelled serum. The virus isolated in culture is thus identified by immunofluorescence. Ultra-thin section immunofluorescence Improvement in ultra-thin section immunofluorescence techniques makes it possible to detect the presence of BRS virus more quickly and more efficiently than in the past. Sections 2 to 3 microns thick are made from lung tissue fragments in a cryostat. The tissue sections are mounted on slides and fixed with acetone for 20 minutes at -20~ The sections are then coated with labelled hyperimmune sera specific to BRS, B~D, reo-like, Corona virus, parainfluenza-3, IBR and adenoviruses. We also use a serum for detecting the macrophages which are frequently present in the lung tissue of cattle suffering from chronic pneumonia and which may therefore lead to error in diagnosis. By means of our procedure we have been able to identify BRS antigen in about 40 cases. Each time we have succeeded in doing so we have monitored the other cattle on the farm concerned for the presence of BRS antibodies. The diagnostic method using immunofluorescence enables anti-BRS virus antigen to be detected when the virus is no longer infectious. Bronchitic and bronchiclitic lesions are the most characteristic and are very useful for establishing the diagnosis. A single layer of positive cells separates intact portions of the mucous membrane from the broncho or bronchiolar tubes, which are often obstructed by cell debris 9 The findings in alveolar material are more difficult to interpret because of the presence of macro-",

The IIF test revealed a titre of antibodies to the disease of 1:45 for at least a month. These antibodies disappeared about two months after the onset of the viral infection (see Figs. 20 and d). SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FINDINGS BY adopting new techniques we have been able to speed up laboratory diagnosis of respiratory disorders caused by BRS virus. Identification of the active pathogen in the respiratory disorders explains the ineffectiveness of symptomatic treatments. The application of our methods in differential dia~aosis has revealed the role of the various viruses in the disease states observed. This information enables the vaccine specific to the causative virus to be selected. Differential diagnosis also supplies the explanation of some apparent lack of success in vaccination. There are various different aetiologies in respiratory diseases of cattle but the vaccines applicable are strictly specific. C ONC LUSI ONS There is difficulty in the clinical diagnosis of respiratory disorders caused by BRS virus. Only a limited number of experienced veterinary practitioners are able to decide on the diagnosis of this agent. Isolation of the virus by seeding cell cultures is problematic, because frequently the specimens no longer contain infectious particles. Examination of ultra-thin lung sections stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled serum is a successful and reliable method. Its use is likely to increase. However, serum testing remains the technique of choice. High antibody i itres in CF and IIF demonstrate recent infection by the BRS virus. Improvement in diagnosis of the causative virus in bovine respiratory ~isorders should result in better understanding of this type of disease ~tnd may lead to the production and testing of effective vaccines. !~E FERENCES ~rtha,A. and Aldasy,P,, 1964.
