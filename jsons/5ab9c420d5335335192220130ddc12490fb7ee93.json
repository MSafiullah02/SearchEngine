Susceptibility to COVID-19 is a concern among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are at increased risk of infection due to immunosuppressive therapy. The receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, is upregulated in IBD [2] and may therefore increase host susceptibility. International cohorts have reported no increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with IBD [3, 4] . However, these studies do not report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 in IBD patients. Our institution was among the first to initiate large-scale SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in northern California. We characterized the prevalence and clinical predictors of COVID-19 in patients with IBD.",

We collected data including demographics, IBD characteristics (subtype, location, phenotype, disease activity), co-morbid conditions, reasons for testing, symptoms, medications, and outcomes. We calculated prevalence of IBD among all patients tested and the prevalence of COVID-19 among IBD patients.

The prevalence of IBD among patients undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing is 1.2% which is comparable to the prevalence of IBD (1.3%) in the U.S. adult population [6] . Our COVID-19 positivity rate of 3% in IBD patients is comparable to the population-weighted prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positive serology in Santa Clara county at 2.8%. [7] Our data suggest that IBD patients are not disproportionately being tested more, nor do they have a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity compared to the background population in northern California. One explanation is that increased ACE2 expression may not mediate SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in IBD patients. Another possibility is that immunosuppressive medications in IBD patients may attenuate viral-induced respiratory inflammation leading to an asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 course in IBD patients who subsequently do not seek testing. Our study also demonstrates that patients older than 66 years of age are at increased risk of COVID-19. Our results are consistent with a prior retrospective study from China which demonstrated that older age is an independent predictor of COVID-19 [8] .",

Third, our study included patients from a large geographic area encompassing a diverse patient population. Our study has several limitations. First, our study was observational and cannot establish causation or account for unmeasured confounders. Second, we were unable to assess the predictors of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality with our small sample size and low event rate. A significantly larger sample size is needed to further clarify predictors of COVID-19 outcomes.

IBD patients with COVID-19 were older (70.6 years vs 47 years, P<0.001), more obese (60.0% vs 16.6%, P=0.011), more likely to have hypertension (80.0% vs 23.3%, P<0.001) and diabetes mellitus (40.0% vs 9.8%, P=0.029). IBD patients with COVID-19 were more likely to use ACE inhibitors (60.0% vs 6.1%, P<0.001) and 5-ASA (80.0% vs 33.1%, P=0.025). In univariate analysis (Supplementary Table 1), age > 66 years (OR 31.37, P=0.003), obesity (BMI \u2265 30) (OR 7.83, COVID-19 in IBD in California P=0.011), hypertension (OR 13.58, P=0.021), and ACE inhibitor use (OR 23.70, P=0.001) were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 among patients with IBD. Our multivariate logistic regression model, which included age >66 years old, obesity, hypertension, and ACE inhibitor use as co-variates, showed that age > 66 years was independently associated with increased risk (OR 21.30, P=0.022) of COVID-19. Clinical outcomes of IBD patients with COVID-19 are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Four IBD patients had a mild course, whereas one patient (Patient 3) developed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and died despite aggressive interventions.",
