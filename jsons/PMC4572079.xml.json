While glomerulopathy is a hallmark of early renal injury in DN [3], tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are major features of late-stage DN and are closely associated with loss of renal function [4\u20137]. The mechanisms underlying tubulointerstitial fibrosis, however, are incompletely understood. TGF-\u03b21 is considered to be the most potent inducer of fibrogenesis [8]. Indeed, patients and animal models with type 1 or 2 diabetes have significantly elevated serum and urinary TGF-\u03b21 levels [9\u201311] as well as heightened TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein expression in glomeruli and the tubulointerstitium [12\u201316].",

Rat AGT overexpression in RPTCs leads to hypertension, albuminuria and RPTC hypertrophy, and enhances TGF-\u03b21 expression in diabetic AGT-transgenic (Tg) mice [19, 20]. Conversely, RPTC-selective overexpression of catalase or pharmacological blockade of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) attenuates hypertension, ROS generation, kidney injury and normalised RPTC ACE-2 expression in mouse models of diabetes [21\u201324]. Taken together, these observations indicate that oxidative stress-induced upregulation of AGT expression and downregulation of ACE-2 expression in RPTCs, resulting in higher angiotensin (Ang)II/Ang 1\u20137 ratio, may be key determinants of development of hypertension and nephropathy in diabetes.",

Here, we report that overexpression of hnRNP F stimulates Ace-2 gene transcription and suppresses profibrotic gene (Tgf-\u03b21, Tgf-\u03b2rII) expression in RPTCs of Akita Hnrnpf-Tg mice. We have confirmed these changes by in vitro studies in rat RPTCs. We also show that hnRNP F overexpression prevents TGF-\u03b21 signalling and inhibition of Ace-2 gene expression in RPTCs. Finally, we identified the putative DNA response elements (REs) in the Ace-2 gene promoter that are responsive to hnRNP F and TGF-\u03b21.",

Importantly, addition of anti-hnRNP F and anti-Smad 2/3 antibody induced a supershift of the respective Hnrnpf-RE and SMAD-REs with the nuclear proteins, respectively (Fig. 7g,h).",

This possibility is supported by our findings that hnRNP F considerably augments the activity of an Ace-2 gene promoter and that the Hnrnpf siRNA and deletion of the putative Hnrnpf-RE markedly reduced the rat Ace-2 gene promoter activity in RPTCs. Furthermore, the biotinylated-labelled Hnrnpf-RE specifically bound to RPTC nuclear proteins and the addition of anti-hnRNP F antibody yielded a supershift of biotinylated-labelled Hnrnpf-RE binding with nuclear proteins in EMSA. These data demonstrate that hnRNP F binds to the putative Hnrnpf-RE and stimulates Ace-2 gene transcription.
