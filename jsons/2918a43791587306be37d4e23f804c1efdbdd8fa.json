Donor and acceptor template homology facilitates both replicative and recombinogenic transfers, but homologyindependent determinants may also contribute. Here, improved murine leukemia virus-based assays were established and the effects of varying extents of mismatches and complementarity between primer and acceptor template regions were assessed. Template switch accuracy was addressed by examining provirus structures, and efficiency was measured using a competitive titer assay. The results demonstrated that limited mismatch extension occurred readily during both minus and plus strand transfer. A strong bias for correct targeting to the U3/R junction and against use of alternate regions of homology was observed during minus strand transfer. Transfer to the U3/R junction was as accurate with five bases of complementarity as it was with an intact R, and as few as 3 nt targeted transfer to a limited extent. In contrast, 12 base recombinogenic acceptors were utilized poorly and no accurate switch was observed when recombination acceptors retained only five bases of complementarity.

Transfer of 2 sssDNA to the U3/R junction at the 3 0 end of viral RNA allows continued minus strand synthesis.

One study demonstrated that although a repeated non-viral sequence of 85 nt can direct minus strand transfer, titers for non-viral repeat vectors are significantly lower than those for vectors with the native 69 nt MLV R. 24 In purified reactions in vitro, both MLV and HIV-1 RT are unable to support efficient strand transfer of donor/acceptor pairs that contain heterologous R sequences (MLV RT \u00fe HIV-1 R donor/acceptor and vice versa). 25, 26 Artificial R sequences are also unable to support MLV strand transfer in vitro. 27 Research from our own laboratory suggests that complementarity-independent features of the MLV U3/R junction region may contribute to 2 sssDNA targeting. 28 The present report extends our previous work on minus strand transfer. The initial experiments established an improved assay designed to eliminate the major classes of background products observed in previous work 9, 28, 29 and provided evidence that such artifacts likely affected some previous work. This new assay system was next used to study mismatch extension during minus strand transfer, and to assess the effects of limited primer-terminal complementarity on acceptor template use. Separate vectors were developed to examine plus strand transfer and recombinogenic transfer, and homology requirements for minus strand transfer were compared to those for recombinogenic switching. The data indicated that minus strand transfer and recombinogenic template switching are not equivalent events in terms of homology requirements.

During replication in cultured cells, most MLV minus strand transfer occurs only after RT reaches the 5 0 end of the donor repeat. 30 However, other outcomes, such as mismatch extension, premature jump, or abortive replication (Figure 2 (B)), have been reported among minus strand transfer products when acceptor and donor template regions differ. 3, 11, 28, 31 In previous studies, we evaluated minus strand transfer using an MLV-based vector that was constructed from a proviral clone and contained a puromycin resistance cassette, which is referred to as pMLVpuro in this study ( Figure 3 (A)). 28 Upon transfection into mammalian cells, pMLVpuro produces an RNA with a puromycin resistance cassette in place of virus coding sequences, and thus replication of this vector is limited to a single round. Identical R repeats at both ends of MLVpuro RNA serve as strand transfer donor and acceptor sequences. Our previous work examined reverse transcription outcomes for MLVpuro derivatives that contained mutations in the 3 0 R. Integrated products of these derivatives were analyzed to determine the mutations' effects on strand transfer. 28 A weakness of the MLVpuro assay system is the potential for background that masks legitimate reverse transcription products when titers of the latter are low. One cause of background is plasmid homologous recombination between LTRs during transfection, which can result in the synthesis of RNAs with wild-type sequences in place of engineered 3 0 end mutations. 32 Even though such recombinants arise rarely, their RNAs are reverse transcribed efficiently, and thus they generate a wild-type background that obscures low-frequency strand transfer events. 28 Wild-type background can also result from the reverse transcription of rare read-in transcripts (Figure 2 (C)). 9, 29 Here, a new assay vector was developed to eliminate both of these artifacts. Its key feature was a vast reduction in sequences that could support plasmid-level recombination or allow template switching on extended read-in transcripts. For this new chimeric MLV-based retroviral construct, called pRSVpuro ( Figure 3(A) ), the MLV U3 promoter that drives vector transcription was replaced with a Rous sarcoma virus promoter. pRSVpuro was identical to pMLVpuro except for the RSV promoter in the 5 0 LTR. pMLVpuro and pRSVpuro were designed to produce identical RNAs when transfected into mammalian cells.

An interesting observation for TM4 was that despite the same amount of complementarity (4 nt) at both the U3/ R junction and the Bss HII site, strand transfer occurred four times more frequently to the U3/R junction. Similarly, the TM3 vector targeted to the U3/R junction 12% of the time despite the availability of more extensive complementarity at the nearby Bss HII site, and did not detectably utilize either of two other fortuitous 3 nt targets in U3. Taken together, these data indicate that 5 nt of complementarity were sufficient to accurately target to the U3/R junction. The U3/R junction was used preferentially to alternate sites with equivalent amounts of complementarity for all relevant (TM3 and TM4) vectors, and as few as 3 nt could direct some accurate transfer. Although the Bss HII site was the major alternate acceptor for low-titer vectors, minor alternate products were sometimes detectable when gels were overexposed to film (not shown). Based on their abundance among detected products and the titers of the vectors that generated them, these rare products likely arose at frequencies roughly five orders of magnitude lower than matched donor/acceptor products. To determine the origins of some of these rare products, bands were excised from dried gels, eluted in TE, and re-amplified by PCR. Four alternate products were sequenced. One resulted from transfer of full length R to an alternate site, two products resulted from transfer from read-in transcripts, and one resulted from premature jump before completion of 2 sssDNA. The minor alternate target for full-length R transfer was located in the SV40 polyadenylation region. The point of transfer for this product contained three primer terminal complementary nucleotides, followed by one mismatch, and then three additional complementary nucleotides. One of the read-in transcripts transferred with 8 nt of fortuitous complementarity present within the SV40 polyadenylation region. The second read-in transcript transferred to a region with no sequence complementarity.

Variant R sequences were constructed by PCR using mutagenic primers and cloned into the downstream LTR using standard techniques. Pbs mutants were constructed by amplifying the pbs region using mutagenic primers and subcloning into pRSVpuro. pRSVpuroM/B was the parental clone for this series of mutants: as presented in Figure 7 (A), this construct contains one point mutation on either side of the pbs, introducing an Mfe I site upstream of the pbs and a Bam HI site downstream. For constructs with 493 nt of lacZ downstream of R in the 3 0 LTR, R1-lacZ-R2 sequences were PCR amplified and inserted into pRSVpuro. Sequences extend from nucleotides 21 to 514 of the lacZ coding region. PuroIntron clones were pRSVpuro derivatives subcloned from a plasmid, pJPE657-13, which contained an artificial intron that was based on intron consensus sequences 55 inserted into the puromycin resistance gene of pMLVpuro. The intron was constructed by PCR amplifying pUC sequences with flanking primers containing intron consensus sequences and subcloning into pMLVpuro. The donors used in PuroIntron clones were derived from the first 30 nt of the MLV R and 5 nt, 12 nt, or 30 nt of the MLV R, located in the context of non-U3 intron sequences, served as the acceptor sequences. Note that the acceptor for the 30TMintron clone was subcloned from the 30Rlac30R construct and thus contained the 493 nt lacZ spacer downstream of the 30 nt acceptor. All PCR-generated fragments were sequenced to verify that all clones contained the intended sequences.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 785, "end": 793, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Materials and Methods"}, {"text": "All transfections and infections were performed in 6 cm culture dishes.
