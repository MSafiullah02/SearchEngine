            "text": "The Syrian golden hamster has been used broadly in biomedical research for decades, especially as a model for cancer development. More recently, it has been served as models in research on diabetes (Bhathena et al., 2011), atherosclerosis (Dillard et al., 2010, Jove et al., 2013), and neural plasticity (Staffend and Meisel, 2012). Also, the Syrian hamster is frequently employed in studies of infectious disease, as it is highly susceptible to infection with a wide range of viruses, bacteria, and parasites (Espitia et al., 2010, Zivcec et al., 2011). The Syrian hamster has been used to study emerging and highly pathogenic RNA viral infections and virus-induced diseases, including flaviviruses (West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Yellow fever virus), alphaviruses (Venezuelan-, Western-, Eastern equine encephalitis virus), henipavirus (Nipah virus), arenaviruses (Pirital virus, Pichinde virus ), bunyaviruses (Rift valley fever virus, Punta Toro virus, Andes virus), filoviruses (Ebola virus, Marburg virus), and SARS-coronavirus (Ebihara et al., 2013, Gowen and Holbrook, 2008, Holbrook and Gowen, 2008, Nakayama and Saijo, 2013, Roberts et al., 2005). Further, the Syrian hamster has proved to be a useful model to evaluate vaccines and anti-viral drugs against both RNA and DNA viruses (Julander et al., 2007, Julander et al., 2011, Monath et al., 2010, Morrey et al., 2004, Morrey et al., 2008, Toth et al., 2008, Wold and Toth, 2012).",

Human Ads are double-stranded DNA viruses with a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid. There are approximately 60 types (previously referred to as serotypes) that are classified into seven species from A to G (Berk, 2013). In immunocompetent healthy individuals, most Ad infections are generally mild and self-limiting, resulting in infections in the upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts (Wold and Ison, 2013). Some serotypes can cause serious ocular illness such as epidemic keratoconjunctinitis. In immunocompromised individuals, especially in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, Ads can cause severe disseminated multi-organ infections which are sometimes lethal (Echavarria, 2008, Ison, 2006, Lion, 2014, Matthes-Martin et al., 2012, Matthes-Martin et al., 2013, Sandkovsky et al., 2014, Stercz et al., 2012, Wold and Ison, 2013).",

Our study has increased the number of non-redundant transcripts for the Syrian hamster from 11,648 to 42,707, representing 34,191 unique genes, resulting in 4\u00d7 increased gene discovery in our data set. The larger tissue sampling combined with LPS treatment and deeper sequencing all contributed to the increased gene discovery.",

            "text": "Investigations into interactions among Ad and specific cellular proteins and pathways in cell culture have provided insights about Ad and host responses. Genome-wide gene expression analyses have been performed by several laboratories using different cell lines, cell culture conditions, cells (non-cancerous versus cancer; proliferating or quiescent), wild-type Ad, various replication-competent and replication-defective vectors, and different conditions such as time post-infection and multiplicity of infection. Several microarray studies were conducted with Ad5 or the closely related Ad2 in non-cancerous human cells, namely in IMR-90 cells (a normal diploid cell derived from lungs of a 16 week female fetus) (Granberg et al., 2006, Stilwell and Samulski, 2004, Zhao et al., 2007), WI-38 cells (diploid cell line derived from normal embryonic lung culture) (Rao et al., 2006), synchronized human foreskin fibroblasts (Miller et al., 2007), or normal human bronchial epithelial cells (Dorer et al., 2011). Then, more recently, Ad2-induced transcriptome changes were studied in detail in IMR-90 cells using a sensitive cDNA deep sequencing strategy (Zhao et al., 2012). In general, these studies depict a struggle between the virus and the host cell in which the virus assumes control of the cell and the cell fights back with anti-viral defenses. The response begins within minutes of the virus interacting with the cell receptors and continues throughout the periods of virus early gene expression, viral DNA replication and early-late gene expression, and very late gene expression and virus assembly. Three of the microarray studies identified 988 (Zhao et al., 2007), about 2000 (Miller et al., 2007), or 943 (424 up, 519 down) (Dorer et al., 2011) cellular genes that were differentially up- or down-regulated by a factor of 2, and the RNA sequencing approach found 3791 genes that were differentially regulated (Zhao et al., 2012). Of these genes, it\u2019s not clear whether the changes are caused by the action of the virus directly, e.g. through the activity of the E1A transcriptional co-regulator, or by the cell \u201csensing\u201d that it has been infected. Altogether, these studies revealed that Ad infection leads to induction of genes involved in cell cycle regulation (activation), cell proliferation, chromatin reorganization, DNA replication, RNA transcription and processing, nucleotide metabolism, and the Wnt signaling pathway. Some but not all genes whose promoters contain binding sites for the E2F transcription factor were conspicuously up-regulated (Miller et al., 2007, Zhao et al., 2012). When quiescent human foreskin fibroblasts were infected, there was a reversal of the quiescent state similar to that seen in the cellular response to serum (Miller et al., 2007). In contrast to the up-regulated genes, there is repression of genes involved in cell differentiation, various signaling pathways (TGF\u03b2, Rho, G-protein, Map kinase, STAT, NF\u03baB), cell death regulation, and metabolism (Dorer et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2012). Transcriptional activity associated with the p53 transcription factor was suppressed (Miller et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Another study in IMR-90 cells employed chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with microarray (ChIP\u2013chip) technology to analyze global changes in gene expression at early (6 h), intermediate (12 h), and late times p.i. with h5dl1500, an Ad5 mutant that expresses only the 243 amino acid (243R) version of E1A protein (Ferrari et al., 2008), see review by Ferrari et al. (2009). Interaction of the conserved region 1 (CR1) and conserved region 2 (CR2) domains of the E1A 243R protein with RB family proteins leads to the release of free E2F family members to activate (or, with some E2F members, to repress) transcription of target genes. Also, interaction of the 243R N-terminus with histone acetyltransferase proteins (p300/CBP) regulates chromatin structure by altering the global pattern of histone modification, in particular H2K18ac, an epigenetic marker for actively transcribed genes (Ferrari et al., 2012, Horwitz et al., 2008). Ferrari et al. (2008) found that transcription of ~70% of cellular genes was altered in cells infected by H5dl1500 and that these changes were linked to E1A binding to RB members and p300/CBP. In brief, at early times p.i., E1A caused induction of genes that function in cell cycle regulation, and at late times (24 h p.i.) E1A activity led to repression of genes that function in development, differentiation, and cell signaling. Cell genes involved in defense against virus infection were induced at 6 h but repressed by 24 h p.i. The results of Ferrari et al. (2008) are generally consistent with the gene profiling data discussed earlier and they appear to make sense: cell cycle and DNA replication genes needed by the virus are induced and antiviral defense genes and cell differentiation genes that are harmful or not needed by the virus are repressed.",

E4orf3 functions in Ad replication by causing cellular proteins to re-localize into filamentous nuclear inclusions termed \u201ctracks\u201d. Multiple cellular proteins that are re-localized into these tracks function in the DNA damage response, the interferon response, and cellular transcription. Upon induction of E4orf3 in the transfected cells, more than 400 cellular genes were differentially regulated; 70% of the genes were upregulated and 30% were downregulated. With at least 8 of these genes, dysregulation was linked to nuclear track formation, i.e. physical relocation of cellular proteins into the tracks (Vink et al., 2015). Many of the genes with altered expression influence cellular growth properties and a variety of the proteins coded by these genes localize to the extracellular space or plasma membrane. Some genes affected by E4orf3 are also involved in antiviral activity.",

Accordingly, we developed a hamster expression microarray to investigate the transcriptional response in the liver to systemic Ad5 infection. Our analysis revealed that approximately 16% of total unique transcripts were differentially expressed, indicating an extensive change in liver transcription. Functional analysis using GO categories revealed that genes involved in the immune response, defense response to virus, and antigen processing and presentation were largely upregulated (Table 2A). The same is true with genes associated with regulating DNA-dependent transcription, signal transduction, cell adhesion, and cell communication (Table 2A). Cell adhesion and cell-cell communication are critical in immune response networks where various lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and antigen interact actively. Up-regulation of genes in these categories is further indication of an activated immune response to virus infection. The most down-regulated genes were associated with oxidation\u2013reduction process, metabolic process, carbohydrate metabolic process, DNA topological change, protein translation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle (Table 2A, Table 3). Our results are in good agreement with the microarray analysis of gene expression in the liver of C57BL/6 J mice infected i.v. with a replication-defective Ad5 vector (Hartman et al., 2007). The latter study found that up-regulated genes are over-represented in categories involving the defense response, immune response, antigen presentation, signal transduction, and RNA processing, whereas down-regulated genes are over-represented in categories associated with metabolism, oxidoreduction, chromatin maintenance, and remodeling.",

Other genes associated with the inflammatory response such proteoglycan 3 and cytokine IL-6 were also upregulated. Most notably, a cluster of genes including PKR and oligoadenylate synthase family members OAS1-3 were upregulated. PKR and OAS are two major IFN-induced effectors demonstrated to possess antiviral activities against various viruses through different mechanisms of action. Following activation by viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), OAS synthesizes 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates that in turn activate RNAse L, which in turn triggers cellular and viral RNA cleavage. IFN-induced PKR, following binding of dsRNA, inhibits cellular and viral protein translation by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008, Sadler and Williams, 2008).",

We have shown that the number of MHC II positive cells increased in the liver of Ad5 infected hamsters, and that these cells up-regulate the surface expression of MHC II, indicating up-regulation of the antigen presentation process. These flow cytometry data corroborate data obtained using microarray and qRT-PCR. This elevation in the number of MHC II positive cells in the liver is somewhat unexpected, inasmuch as Ad5 is known to preferentially infect and kill Kupffer cells, the major MHC II positive cell population in the liver, within minutes of intravenous injection (Smith et al., 2008). Further, the Ad E1 A protein down-regulates the expression of MHC II RNA (Kretsovali et al., 1998). Clearly, further investigation is needed to discover the nature of the MHC II positive cells in the liver of Ad5-infected hamsters.",

The 60-mer probes were designed using the high-confidence transcripts. Briefly, each transcript was divided into non-overlapping (contiguous) 60 nucleotide oligonucleotide (oligos). We calculated four parameters for each oligo: uniqueness, sequence complexity, self-annealing and melting temperature (T\nM). The uniqueness parameter is the binding energy (Allawi and SantaLucia, 1998) calculated using the sequence of the oligo to the reverse-complementary sequence and to its closest match identified by BLASTN against the high-confidence transcripts. Sequence complexity is calculated using the Ziv and Lempel algorithm (Ziv and Lempel, 1977). The T\nM is calculated using equation and parameters as previously described (Bolton and Mc Carthy, 1962).
