            "text": "To date, there is still a variety of human diseases of unknown etiology, including several chronic diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS), but also acute infections such as Kawasaki disease and multiple respiratory diseases (1,2). A viral origin has been suggested for many of these diseases, emphasizing the importance of a continuous search for new viruses. Identification of previously unrecognized viral agents in patient samples is of great medical interest, but remains a major technical challenge. Identification of novel viral pathogens is difficult with the virus discovery tools known to date. Several problems are encountered when searching for new viruses. First, most of the unidentified viruses do not replicate in vitro, at least not in the cells that are commonly used in viral diagnostics. Second, the molecular biology techniques previously employed to identify unknown viruses have their specific drawbacks. Several techniques are in use for virus discovery, e.g., universal primer PCR, random priming based PCR, and representational difference analysis (RDA). Although every technique has proven to be useful for virus discovery in certain circumstances, they all have serious limitations and restrictions.",

First, a choice for a specific virus family has to be made. This limits the possibility of identifying a member of an unsuspected family or the founding member of a totally new one. Second, the universal primers may simply not match the genome sequence of novel members of a virus family. This is illustrated by the lack of success of universal coronavirus primers that were designed before the new members\u2014SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1\u2014were identified. None of the studies that used such primers was able to detect a novel human coronavirus (3,4). Obviously, such primers gradually improve once more family members are known.",

However, most ingredients of this assay contain contaminating DNA. For instance, the enzymes used may contain trace amounts of DNA from the bacteria in which they are produced. This contaminating DNA is also amplified and it is therefore not possible to determine at an early stage whether amplification products represent a new virus or contaminating nucleic acids. This can be resolved only after excessive cloning and sequencing. Therefore, high throughput screening of many clinical samples is impractical. Moreover, this technique has only been successful with viruses that replicate in vitro, in which case cell culture supernatant was used as input for the assay (5).",

RDA utilizes PCR to generate sets of nucleic acids in a target and a (negative control) tester sample. After subtractive hybridization, there is selective amplification of target-enriched sequences. The method was developed for tissue material and not for nontissue samples such as serum/plasma or virus culture supernatants (6). The fact that these liquid samples have low concentrations of DNA and RNA in the tester sample may restrain the selective amplification of an unknown viral target. A disadvantage of this technique is that it requires a negative control tissue from the same person from whom the diseased tissue was obtained.",

In addition, a DNase treatment is used to remove interfering chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA from degraded cells, whereas RNases in the sample will degrade RNA. During this step, the viral nucleic acid is specifically protected within the viral particle. Next, DNase/Rnases are inactivated and the viral nucleic acids are subsequently extracted from the particles, RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA, and second-strand synthesis is performed to make dsDNA (from a viral RNA or DNA genome). The dsDNA is digested with frequently cutting restriction enzymes that are likely to be present in every viral target (HinP1-I and Mse-I), and HinP1-I- and Mse-I-anchors are ligated to the digested DNA. Essential to the method is that the restriction enzymes remain active during the ligase reaction, thus preventing concatamerization of digested fragments. The anchors themselves are not removed because they are designed in such a way that the restriction site is lost.\n\n",

The PCR fragments that are specific to the \u201cinfected\u201d clinical sample can then be cloned and sequenced. Because amplification is based on the presence of restriction sites, the PCR is reproducible (in duplicate samples the same fragments are amplified) and these PCR products can be distinguished from background amplification. The assay is relatively high-throughput as multiple samples (about ten) can be tested per cycle of VIDISCA.",

Using urine, we could detect adenoviral DNA and influenza B RNA in two patients. The technique can also detect HIV-1 and picornaviruses in cell culture. These results illustrate that the VIDISCA technique has the capacity to identify both RNA and DNA viruses directly from patient material or from cell cultures. In fact, it was the first experiment with a suspected virus culture that led to identification of a novel human coronavirus [HCoV-NL63 (9)]. Only three human coronaviruses were known at that time: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV (10,11), and HCoV-NL63 represents the fourth species. The rapid identification of this novel coronavirus demonstrates the power of our virus discovery tool, which can now be used to test large sample sets suspected of containing viral pathogens.",

This selective PCR is performed with primers with sequence identical as the standard primers, but with an additional nucleotide on its 3\u2032 part. This additional nucleotide is outside the adaptor sequence and thus belongs to the unknown material (Fig.\n2). Use of an additional nucleotide allows separation of the reactions in 16 different primer combinations and enables better analysis of the sample. To have a selectivity that is required when one wants to amplify only those fragments with a 100% match, the thermocycling profile is designed to increase the specificity of reaction by using the starting annealing temperature of 65\u00b0C, which gradually decreases during first ten cycles to 56\u00b0C.The PCR mix is prepared as described below (47.5 \u03bcl per sample).

Additionally, the MetaPhor agarose provides an easy setup and high-throughput processing for gel analysis and purification, compared to the polyacrylamide gels. The MetaPhor agarose gel is prepared as described below.150 ml of 0.5X concentrated TBE buffer is poured into an Erlenmeyer flask and stirred with a magnetic stirrer. 4 g of MetaPhor agarose is weighted and gently poured into the Erlenmeyer flask while mixing. Addition of all agarose powder at once will result in clumping of the agarose. The solution is stirred for another 10 min to soak the agarose grains and heated in the microwave for 60 sec with low power. After the primary heating, the agarose is stirred and heated in 30-sec cycles (low power) with extensive stirring in between. All the agarose is solubilized during a final heating step for 60 sec with medium power. The agarose is cooled down to \u223c65\u00b0C and 10 \u03bcl of ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml) is added. The agarose is poured into the electrophoresis tray and combs are inserted. It is crucial to remove all air bubbles from the gel (e.g., with a pipette tip). The agarose is solidified at room temperature and further incubated at 4\u00b0C for at least 20 min (the incubation at 4\u00b0C improves the gel resolution).

A picture is taken for analysis and the gel is stored at 4\u00b0C, wrapped in plastic (Saran Wrap). The picture of the gel is used to search for fragments that are present in the sample of interest and not in the control sample All the fragments that are present exclusively in the sample of interest are marked on the picture (Fig.\n3). If the bands appear very faint on the gel, the PCR products can be concentrated by vacuum centrifuge and reanalyzed on a MetaPhor gel. After fragment selection, the gel is again positioned on the UV transilluminator and the selected bands are excised with sterile razors (about 100 mg per slice) and stored in coded 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at 4\u00b0C (see\nNote 7). After excision of all bands, a second picture of the gel should be taken to document the proper excision.\nThe DNA fragments from the gel are extracted with the QIAquick gel extraction kit following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The gel slices are solubilized in 600 \u03bcl of QG buffer and 100 \u03bcl of isopropanol is added. After extraction, resulting DNA is dissolved in 30 \u03bcl of EB buffer. Alternatively, any other gel extraction method may be used.\n",

The raw sequence is edited to remove the sequence derived from the vector and the adaptors. This procedure can be done manually or using designated program, e.g., CodonCode (http://www.codoncode.com/). After the cleanup, the sequences are analyzed for their quality and only those that show a clear, single signal are exported in FASTA format for further analysis. Once imported to the BioEdit program (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html), the sequences are subjected to batch BLAST analysis with default settings. This batch analysis allows preselection of the sequences of interest, as mRNA and rRNA fragments are frequently found as background. All results that indicate the presence of a virus, or an unknown sequence should be selected and reanalyzed with the BLAST server (nblast) with the expectation number of 1000 against all databases. If the results are still not clear the following steps might be taken:\nAnalysis against translated database (tblastx)Search the conserved domain database (rpsblast)Analysis against virus database (nblast)\n",

It is not advisable to use TRIzol isolation, as that is intended for isolation of nucleic acids from cells and tissues.The L6 buffer lysis is sufficient to inactivate the virus. After a 10-min incubation it is safe to process the sample in a normal biochemistry laboratory.The L6 and L2 buffer contain concentrated guanidine thiocyanate (GTC) and thus should be considered as highly toxic. Remember to store the GTC waste separately with addition of one-tenth volume of 1 N sodium hydroxide to prevent GTC degradation.All RNA and cDNA handling before the first PCR should be performed in a nucleic-acid-free environment. The sequence independent amplification will result in overamplification of contaminating DNA.The use of chlorine as a decontaminant should be limited as it may decrease the viability of reverse transcription enzyme.If the thermocycling is performed in a PCR machine that does not include heating of the cover, two drops of paraffin oil should be layered on top of the PCR solution to prevent evaporation during the PCR reaction.It is advised to use a fresh razor for each band during excision. The exposure of the gel to UV light should be limited, as such exposure results in DNA degradation.\n",
