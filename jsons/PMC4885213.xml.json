Thirteen years ago, Allis and colleagues\n9\n put forward the \u2018histone code\u2019 hypothesis, which provided a model to explain how single and/or combinatorial posttranslational modifications on histones regulate gene transcription. They hypothesized that this code is as important as the DNA sequence itself. Since the conception of this hypothesis, largely due to the development of techniques such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing, the field has witnessed unprecedented advance in our understanding of the numerous enzymes that contribute to the establishment of histone modifications, as well as the assorted effector proteins that bind them. Whether or not histone modifications constitute a strict \u2018code\u2019, it is clear that the elaborate combinations of posttranslational modifications on histone function tightly regulate cell\u2010specific gene transcription. Also, it has been argued that histone modifications are not truly \u2018epigenetic\u2019, as the nature of their heritability (a requirement in the classical definition of epigenetic) remains questionable. This is particularly relevant in cells of the immune system where direct heritability of induced epigenetic modifications has yet to be formally demonstrated. However, as we will discuss, pathogen\u2010induced epigenetic modifications, particularly in cells of the innate immune system, can influence secondary responses to the same or different pathogens at least in the short term (1 week to 3 months).",

Such regulation is brought about by embellishments on the DNA itself and on DNA\u2010associated histone proteins. DNA modifications primarily are CpG cytosine\u20105 methylation\n10\n and 5\u2010hydroxymethylcytosine,\n11\n but hydroxylation, formylation and carboxylation have also been observed.\n12\n In eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into chromatin, the basic repeating unit of which is a nucleosome. A nucleosome consists of 147 bp nucleotides wrapped around a histone octamer, which is composed of two copies each of histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (Figure 1). With the addition of another histone protein called the \u2018linker\u2019 H1, nucleosomes are packaged into progressively higher\u2010order structures to ultimately form chromosomes. Unstructured NH2\u2010terminal histone tails that protrude from the nucleosome are subject to covalent chemical modifications, which impact chromatin organization and function. Recent mass spectrometry analysis identified more than a dozen different types of posttranslational modifications on histone tails,\n13\n including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, citrullination and ubiquitination.\n14\n Histone modifications with the exception of methylation result in a change in the net charge of nucleosomes, loosening interactions between histones and DNA. This directly affects the levels of chromatin compaction, creating condensed \u2018heterochromatic\u2019 or more open \u2018euchromatic\u2019 regions and thus restricting or allowing access of transcription factors to promoters or enhancers on DNA. The effects of histone methylation on gene expression are dependent on the position of the amino acid residues that are methylated and whether the residues are mono\u2010, di\u2010 or tri\u2010methylated. Methylation of Histone 3, Lysine 4 (H3K4), H3K36 and H3K79 is often associated with active transcription, whereas methylation of H3K9, H3K27 or H4K20 is associated with transcriptional repression.\n10\n, \n15\n\n",

A prominent role for H3K27 methylation has been described in transcriptional responses from innate immune cells. One of the first reports identifying the Jumonji (JMJ) catalytic domain containing JMJD3 as a histone H3K27me3 demethylase demonstrated a rapid induction of JMJD3 by proinflammatory stimuli.\n19\n It was subsequently shown that JMJD3 is recruited to the transcription start sites of >70% of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2010induced genes.\n20\n Further, JMJD3 is essential for M2 macrophage polarization in response to helminth infection and chitin, although it is dispensable for M1 responses.\n21\n The histone methyltransferase G9a directs methylation of histone H3 on Lysine 9 (H3K9me). Di\u2010 or tri\u2010methylation of H3K9 is repressive not only by influencing DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation but also by prohibiting the \u2018activating\u2019 modification acetylation and actively recruiting transcriptional repressors of the Heterochromatin protein 1 family.\n22\n H3K9 methylation is found at a subset of promoters of inducible genes such as IL12b and CCL22 but this repressive mark is removed rapidly following LPS stimulation.\n23\n Similarly, H3K9 di\u2010methylation levels at type I interferon (IFN) and IFN responsive genes inversely correlate with the scope and amplitude of IFN and ISG expression. Professional IFN\u2010producing cells such as dendritic cells have significantly lower levels of H3K9 di\u2010methylation at these gene promoters compared with weak producers of IFN, such as fibroblasts, cardiac myocytes, or neuroblastoma cells. Further, genetic ablation of the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a enhanced IFN production by fibroblasts and their ability to suppress virus.\n2\n Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) and other sensors modify histones in a manner associated with the activation of transcription. Two of the main permissive modifications are H3 Lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) denoting an active promoter and H3 Lysine 36 tri\u2010methylation (H3K36me3) associated with active transcription. Dendritic cells stimulated with LPS upregulate H3K4me3, which is very stable for 2 h following stimulation, with the exception of about 30 loci that are lowly expressed before stimulation and become strongly induced after stimulation.\n24\n Similarly, macrophages upregulate H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 at the promoters and enhancers, respectively, of multiple genes following exposure to a range of stimuli, with the majority of acquired H3K4me3 returning to basal levels within a few hours.\n4\n, \n25\n\n",

HDACs reverse this process. LPS\u2010stimulated macrophages show increased histone H4 acetylation (H4Ac), an indicator of open chromatin at numerous sites across the genome. The induced histone acetylation at lysines 5, 8 and 12 (H4K5/8/12Ac) usually occurs at promoters, within 1 h of stimulation, decreasing after 2 h.\n25\n In dendritic cells H4K27 acetylation was very dynamic over an LPS time course correlating with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding.\n24\n Histone acetylation is exclusively \u2018read\u2019 by bromodomains of which there are 46 bromodomain\u2010containing proteins in the human genome. Bromodomains of individual proteins have defined affinities to specific locations of lysine acetylation and recruit distinct proteins to the chromatin.\n26\n Hence, each subclass of bromodomain proteins likely has unique functions in regulating gene expression. Most work has focused on the role of the bromodomain and extra\u2010terminal (BET) subfamily of bromodomain\u2010containing proteins that consists of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and a testis\u2010specific BRDT. BET proteins connect histone acetylation state to transcriptional elongation machinery.\n1\n, \n27\n Only BRD4 can recruit positive transcription elongation factor b (P\u2010TEFb) through its C terminal domain and removes the pausing complex negative elongation factor (NELF) and 5,6\u2010dichloro\u20101\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity\u2010inducing factor (DSIF) allowing transcriptional elongation.\n27\n, \n28\n BRD4 can also co\u2010activate transcriptional activation of NF\u2010\u03baB via specific binding to acetylated RelA.\n29\n Knockdown of BRD2, 3 or 4 proteins, however, results in reduced expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, suggesting that all three BET proteins control the transcription of inflammatory genes in LPS\u2010stimulated macrophages.\n25\n This is likely through the ability of BRD2, 3 and 4 to interact with the polymerase\u2010associated factor 1 complex, or other chromatin\u2010modifying proteins such as NSD3 or JMJD6.\n30\n\n",

ATP\u2010dependent chromatin\u2010remodeling complexes are responsible for sliding of the nucleosomes, as well as for insertion and ejection of histone octamers, processes that are, like histone modification, important for transcriptional repression and activation. The remodeling complexes can be divided into four families: SWI/SNF, CHD (chromodomain and helicase\u2010like domain), ISWI and INO80 (including SWR1, or SRCAP in mammals). Promoters of primary response genes (PRGs) such as Tnf, Fos and Nfkbia contain CpG islands which are refractory to DNA methylation, and histone tail modifications, both of which are commonly found at the promoters of actively transcribed genes (for example, H3K4me3 and H4Ac) as well as high levels of RNA Pol II association in naive macrophages, indicating that these chromatin specifications likely occur during lineage commitment.\n1\n, \n25\n Thus, macrophages are preprogramed to enable expression of a defined set of PRGs within minutes of cell activation.\n34\n, \n35\n These genes do not require SWI/SNF\u2010mediated chromatin remodeling or de novo protein synthesis for their activation, as they are transcriptionally primed and their chromatin state is permissive of rapid access by transcription factors.

In fact, it has been proposed that epigenetic processes may initially have been a means to transduce metabolic events into phenotypic results.\n50\n This is well documented in cancer cells that switch to anaerobic metabolism (the \u2018Warburg effect\u2019) and exhibit multiple epigenetic imbalances.\n49\n Interestingly, macrophages and other innate immune cells are frequently found in inflamed sites, which are characterized by low oxygen levels and therefore may also rely heavily on the relationship between metabolism and epigenetics for gene expression. Certainly, activation of TLRs, notably TLR4, leads to a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis in immune cells.\n51\n Succinate, which is known to inhibit \u03b1\u2010ketoglutarate and Fe(II)\u2010dependent dioxygenases such as histone and DNA demethylases, as well as prolyl hydroxylases,\n50\n is elevated in inflammation and sustains IL\u20101\u03b2 production through hypoxia\u2010inducible factor (HIF)\u20101\u03b1 stabilization.\n52\n Also, differentiation of monocytes to macrophages results in a change in abundance of enzymes responsible for peroxisomal \u03b2\u2010oxidation pathway, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.\n48\n \u03b2\u2010Glucan\u2010trained monocytes exhibited reduced oxygen consumption, enhanced glucose consumption, increased production of lactate and an increased NAD+/NADH ratio,\n5\n which may be responsible for the observed alterations in H3K4me3, H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 in these cells.\n5\n, \n48\n\n",

Moreover, targeting epigenetic \u2018readers\u2019 seemed an appealing way to specifically interrupt the interpretation of epigenetic modifications without altering the overall epigenetic landscape of the cell, which could conceivably occur by targeting \u2018writers\u2019 or \u2018erasers\u2019. Bromodomain modules share a conserved fold that comprises a left\u2010handed bundle of four \u03b1\u2010helices that surround a central acetylated lysine\u2010binding site. I\u2010BET762 (also known as GSK525762A) and GSK525768A (which is the (R)\u2010enantiomer of I\u2010BET762) were identified initially through a screen for upregulation of APOA1. Upon subsequent chemoproteomics involving immobilization of the compounds on a matrix, followed by affinity purification of interacting proteins from cell extracts and liquid chromatography\u2010tandem mass spectrometry, the interacting proteins were identified as BRD2, 3 and 4. I\u2010BET762 acts as a histone mimic and competitively inhibits the binding of BET proteins to acetylated histone peptides, and has a low affinity toward other bromodomain family members, making it a specific inhibitor of the BET subfamily.\n25\n Treatment of mouse bone\u2010marrow\u2010derived macrophages with I\u2010BET762 selectively inhibited activation of a subset of LPS\u2010inducible cytokines, chemokines and several transcription factors required for an inflammatory response.\n25\n LPS\u2010inducible and I\u2010BET susceptible genes showed significantly reduced enrichment of the BET proteins BRD2, 3 and 4, as well as P\u2010TEFb and Pol II, demonstrating that I\u2010BET762 successfully prevented assembly of chromatin\u2010activating and elongation\u2010promoting complexes at these promoters. The vast majority of genes that were suppressed by I\u2010BET were late PRGs and secondary response genes with low CpG, low H4Ac, low H3K4me3 and low Pol II at their promoters in naive macrophages. PRGs or housekeeping genes with high CpG, high H3K4me3 and high H4Ac could not be inhibited with I\u2010BET treatment, possibly because of the inability of I\u2010BET, acting as a histone mimic, to outcompete the preexisting levels of acetylation at those loci.
