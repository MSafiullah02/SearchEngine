His medications included an antihypertensive medication and a proton-pump inhibitor. He was a lifelong non-smoker and worked as a dentist. He had no family history of ILD. His physical exam was significant for dry inspiratory crackles at both bases and normal resting oxygen saturation. His pulmonary function was abnormal with a forced vital capacity of 57% predicted and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 67% predicted. His high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan demonstrated peripheral, subpleural predominant reticulation and traction bronchiectasis without honeycombing.",

He had new onset hypoxemia (88% on room air) with diffuse crackles to auscultation that were more prominent in the left chest. A repeat HRCT demonstrated new ground-glass opacities in the left lung (Fig. 17.1). All microbiologic data was negative, and there was no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or ischemia.\n\n",

Although most patients with IPF experience a steady decline in lung function over time, some will decline quickly, while others seem stable for many years. Increasingly, we recognize that some patients may also have a more unpredictable course [2]. These patients experience periods of relative stability followed by acute episodes of worsening in their respiratory status [3]. Episodes of acute respiratory decline in IPF can be secondary to complications such as infection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or heart failure [3, 4]. Such episodes of acute respiratory deterioration have been termed AEx of IPF when the cause for the acute worsening cannot be identified. Acute exacerbations likely comprise almost 50% of these acute respiratory events, and the clinical characteristics and prognosis are indistinguishable from acute exacerbations of known cause. This chapter will focus on AEx of IPF.",

A survey of providers in the USA suggests that most clinicians believe AEx to be somewhat or very common [9]. The true incidence of AEx remains unknown, and the incidence may vary by country due to different genetic and environmental factors. Largely due to differences in case definition, patient population, sample size, and duration of follow-up, the range of AEx incidence in clinical studies ranges anywhere from 1% to 43% [3, 4, 10\u201323]. In one study of 461 Korean patients with IPF in which patients were followed longitudinally over 3 years, a 1- and 3-year incidence of 14.2% and 20.7%, respectively, was found [4]. In a more ethnically diverse clinical trial population, the incidence of AEx among those in the placebo arm of the INPULSIS study (study drug: nintedanib) was 7.6% over a 52-week period [10].",

A few risk factors have been identified including those indicative of IPF disease severity. The most consistent risk factor for acute exacerbation is a low forced vital capacity (FVC) [4, 15, 18, 19, 21\u201323]. This is consistent with the increased incidence of AEx that was observed in the only study of advanced disease reported in the literature to date, namely, STEP-IPF [26]. Several other parameters reflecting disease severity have also been associated with an increased risk for AEx including low diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [4, 18, 20, 21, 23], poor baseline oxygenation [23, 27], and recent decline in FVC [15, 27, 28]. Other risk factors associated with an increased risk for the development of AEx include higher body mass index [15] and younger age [18]. The data on the role of smoking and coexistent emphysema in AEx of IPF have been mixed [4, 17, 19, 20].",

However, in a prospective study of AEx of IPF (n = 47), acute viral infection, as determined by the most current genomics-based methodologies, was found in only 9% of this cohort [46]. While some cases may well have been missed (i.e., the virus had come and gone by the time testing was obtained), these data suggest that there are many cases of AEx that are not primarily due to occult viral infection. More recently, there are data describing a difference in the microbiome of IPF patients who are experiencing an AEx compared to stable patients. In a study of 20 AEx and 14 stable IPF patients matched for age, sex, smoking history, and baseline lung function, BAL bacterial burden was increased in AEx patients compared to stable patients [47].",

The two follow-up and parallel phase-3 clinical trials using nintedanib had mixed results in regard to prevention of AEx [10]. Interestingly, a secondary data analysis from three IPF clinical trials suggested that pirfenidone was associated with a lower risk of respiratory-related hospitalization compared to placebo, but not all-cause or non-respiratory-related hospitalization [82]. In addition, those hospitalized for any reason had lower risk of death if they were on pirfenidone.

Perhaps we should be more critical of the use of corticosteroids to treat AEx of IPF. There are two distinct viewpoints regarding the role of corticosteroids in AEx of IPF. The first viewpoint is that AEx of IPF is histopathologically similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by DAD and acute lung injury [84] and should, therefore, be treated similarly to ARDS. In the ARDS literature, the mortality benefit of corticosteroids is unclear [85\u201390]. In one study, increased mortality was observed in ARDS patients treated with delayed corticosteroids (after 14 days) [90]. If we were to follow the ARDS paradigm, most clinicians would not use corticosteroids in the treatment of AEx of IPF. A second viewpoint for the role of corticosteroids in IPF is that some patients with AEx of IPF have organizing pneumonia on biopsy [74]. Organizing pneumonia is generally thought to be steroid responsive, and it may be that the pathobiology is different enough between ARDS and AEx of IPF to warrant continued use of corticosteroids. There remains equipoise on the efficacy of corticosteroids in AEx of IPF, and this treatment intervention should be studied more carefully [66].",
