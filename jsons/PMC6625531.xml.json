All LTxRs selected for this study had undergone bilateral LTx and had no significant differences in demographics (eg, sex, age, reason for transplant, HLA matching, etc [Table 1\n]). For each group (ie, PGD, RVI, AR, DSA, and BOS) we identified time-matched controls for analysis.

The results, which are presented in Table 1, summarize our findings: namely, that exosomes from all of the aforementioned post-LTx clinical conditions contain not only allo- and lung SAgs, but also important immunoregulatory molecules and stress markers. It is of interest that costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 were notably absent in the exosomes isolated from patients with symptomatic RVI. Overall, data presented in Table 2\nsuggest that exosomes present in the circulation have many of the molecules necessary to augment immunogenicity, which can lead to CLAD.",
