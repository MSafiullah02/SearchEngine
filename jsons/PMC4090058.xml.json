            "text": "ISG15 forms conjugates with a diverse pool of target proteins in a process referred to as ISGylation. ISGylation occurs through a series enzymatic reactions similar to the ubiquitin conjugation pathway (Fig. 1\n). ISG15 is encoded and expressed as a 17-kDa precursor protein that is immediately proteolytically processed at its C-terminus to expose a C-terminal LRLRGG amino acid sequence, identical with the C-terminal sequence of ubiquitin [10]. The cognate ISG15 E1 activating enzyme, UbE1L, initiates the ISG15 conjugation enzymatic pathway by forming a thioester bond between the C-terminal glycine of ISG15 and a cysteine residue of UbE1L [11], [12]. UbE1L is the only known E1 enzyme for ISG15, and it appears to be specific for ISG15 as it has not formed thioester bonds with other tested ubiquitin-like modifiers [11], [13]. Confirmation of the importance of UbE1L in this pathway has come from the analysis of mice deficient in UbE1L. These mice express unconjugated ISG15 but do not form ISG15 conjugates [14]. Once primed by UbE1L, ISG15 is then transferred to a cysteine residue of an E2 conjugating enzyme. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of UbcH8 in human cells, and UbcM8 in mouse cells, results in nearly complete loss of ISG15 conjugate formation, suggesting that UbcH8 and UbcM8 serve as the predominant E2 enzymes in the ISG15 conjugation system [15], [16]. Additional experiments evaluating whether other proteins may serve as ISG15 E2 enzymes have found the transfer of ISG15 to UbcH5 and to UbcH7, the closest homologs of UbcH8, to be highly unfavorable [12], [17]. Finally, an E3 ligase facilitates the conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins. HERC5, HHARI, and Efp (TRIM25) have all been demonstrated capable of acting as E3 ligases for ISG15 [18], [19], [20], [21]. However, while HHARI and Efp have been shown to act as E3 ligases for specific target proteins, siRNA knockdown of the HECT E3 ligase HERC5 was shown to abrogate nearly all ISG15 conjugate formation, suggesting that it is the predominant E3 ligase for ISG15. Knockdown studies in mouse cells have similarly demonstrated that HERC6 is the predominant ISG15 E3 ligase in mice [22], [23], [24].",

Truncation of target proteins leads to alteration in the ISGylation profile of the protein, further suggesting that the specificity of ISG15 conjugation is not strictly determined by the local amino acid sequence environment of its lysine residues. This study showed that ISGylation targets newly translated proteins, and this appears to be mediated in part by the interaction of HERC5 with polysomes. Thus, the specificity of ISG15 is in part derived from the temporal expression of target proteins. How, or if, ISG15 might discriminate between proteins within the pool of actively translated proteins is unclear.",

The biological function of UBP43 and the effect of increasing ISG15 conjugation were initially evaluated both in vitro and in UBP43-deficient mice [26], [27], [28]. However, the interpretations of these studies have been complicated by the fact that UBP43 has been found to bind to the interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) 2 and inhibit IFN signaling independent of its deconjugating activity [29], [30]. USP2, USP5, USP13, and USP14 have also been shown to cleave peptide fused to the C-terminus of ISG15; however, further studies are needed to determine whether they can deconjugate ISG15 from ISGylated proteins and to understand what biological roles they may play in the regulation of ISGylation [31]. Characterization of these ISG15 deconjugases could advance our understanding of ISGylation, as deubiquitinating enzymes have been found to play an important role in ubiquitin-mediated regulation [32].",

These potential target proteins are involved in all aspects of cellular biology. The functional consequence of ISGylation is still not well understood. Proteasome inhibition has been reported to increase the pool of ISG15 conjugates but does so by means of de novo conjugate formation, not inhibition of conjugate degradation [35]. In fact, there is no evidence that ISGylation results in the proteasome-mediated degradation of target proteins. One of the challenges of studying ISG15 has been that, for every target protein studied, only a small fraction of the total pool of target protein is actually modified by ISG15. This phenomenon is also observed with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). SUMO modification is thought to be highly dynamic, but transient modification of transcription factors can lead to long-lasting downstream consequences through chromatin remodeling or recruitment of inhibitory complexes [36]. Whether a similar dynamic effect might mediate the functionality of ISGylation has yet to be determined.",

Firstly, like ISG15 itself, the predominant ISG15 conjugation and deconjugation enzymes UbE1L, UbcH8/UbcM8, HERC5/HERC6, and UBP43/USP18 are all induced by type I IFN stimulation. Secondly, the ubiquitin conjugation system is constituted by many E2 and E3 proteins [1]. It is the binding specificity of E2 to E3 and E3 to target proteins that allows for ubiquitin to affect such a vast number of biological processes with such specificity. In contrast, it seems that formation of the overwhelming majority of ISG15 conjugates occurs through one E2 enzyme and one E3 enzyme. Finally, there is no evidence that ISG15 conjugates to itself and forms ISG15 chains in the manner of polyubiquitin modification. While not fully understood, these differences between the ISG15 and ubiquitin pathways most likely reflect the specific function of ISG15 conjugation.",

Mice infected with a Sindbis virus expressing ISG15 but not a control virus were protected from virus-induced lethality. This discovery was followed by numerous reports of ISG15 antiviral activity observed in tissue culture under conditions of ISG15 overexpression and siRNA knockdown (Table 1\n). Influenza virus, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Sendai virus (SeV), Japanese encephalitis virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV), human papilloma virus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs), dengue virus, and West Nile virus (WNV) have all been reported to be modestly inhibited by ISG15 in vitro. For several viruses, contradictory results have been reported with regard to whether ISG15 antagonizes virus replication. These discrepancies are likely a result of different experimental conditions. In the case of influenza A virus, it has been reported that inhibition of replication by ISG15 is species and/or cell type specific [42].",

The increased lethality observed in the ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 mice could be rescued when the mice were infected with a recombinant virus expressing WT ISG15, but not when infected with a recombinant virus expressing an ISG15(LRLRAA) mutant incapable of forming conjugates [39]. This suggested that, in this viral model, the antiviral activity of ISG15 was dependent upon its ability to ISGylate proteins.

In contrast, ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 mice experienced dramatic weight loss and viral loads reached levels up to 1000-fold higher than in WT mice at late time points. These observations were found to be true for both the mouse-adapted influenza B/Lee/40 strain and a non-mouse-adapted influenza B/Yamagata/88 strain, indicating that ISG15 may contribute to the species tropism barrier for influenza B virus infection. UbE1L \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with influenza B virus similarly exhibited increased lethality and increased viral burden compared to WT mice, suggesting that ISG15-mediated protection from influenza B virus is also dependent on the ability of ISG15 to form conjugates [44].

This has been seen with the retroviruses HIV-1 and ASLV, as well as with Ebola virus. Despite impacting the release of all of these viruses, detailed studies have identified different mechanisms through which ISG15 is acting. The first evidence of ISG15 inhibiting virus release was observed when characterizing the effect of ISG15 on HIV-1 replication. The replication of HIV-1 in 293T cells transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA was found to be inhibited when cotransfected with a plasmid expressing ISG15 [57]. While ISG15 inhibited HIV-1 release into the supernatant, it did not affect HIV-1 protein production. Expression of ISG15 was shown to inhibit the ubiquitination the HIV-1 Gag protein and the interaction between Gag and Tsg101. Both of these events are important for mediating HIV-1 budding and release [60]. Interestingly, while cotransfection of UbE1L enhanced HIV-1 inhibition, the ectopic expression of ISG15 alone could inhibit the Gag\u2013Tsg101 interaction, raising the possibility that the unconjugated form of ISG15 may be partly mediating this inhibition. A subsequent study has shown that HERC5-mediated ISG15 conjugation can inhibit HIV-1 budding from the plasma membrane [58]. Unlike the initial HIV-1 study, this group found that the HIV-1 Gag protein is ISGylated by HERC5. It was also shown that overexpression of ISG15 without HERC5 resulted in an accumulation of Gag in cytoplasmic clusters, whereas coexpression of ISG15 with HERC5 resulted in an accumulation of Gag at the plasma membrane. These results suggest that unconjugated ISG15 and ISGylation may act to block HIV-1 budding by two distinct mechanisms.",

            "text": "ISG15 was also shown to inhibit Ebola VLP budding by a similar mechanism. Expression of the Ebola matrix protein, VP40, alone is sufficient to produce budding and release of VP40 VLPs [61]. This release is regulated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Nedd4 through a mechanism dependent on its ligase activity [62]. Two studies demonstrated that the coexpression of ISG15 with VP40 can inhibit VP40 VLP release by inhibiting Nedd4 ligase activity and, thus, inhibiting ubiquitination of VP40 [49], [54]. Like the HIV-1 studies, overexpression of ISG15 alone was able to disrupt Ebola VLP release, suggesting that unconjugated ISG15 may be capable of inhibiting Nedd4 ligase activity [49]. Malakhova et al. was able to show that purified ISG15 protein was able to disrupt the ability of Nedd4 to bind to ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzymes, thus preventing ubiquitin from being transferred to the catalytic cysteine residue of Nedd4 [54]. This study further showed that ISG15 could inhibit other Nedd4-like E3 ligases from augmenting VP40 VLP release. The ISG15 disruption of ubiquitin-mediated regulation during both Ebola virus and HIV-1 release raises an intriguing model for general ISG15 regulation through ubiquitin antagonism. It is possible that unconjugated ISG15 could compete with ubiquitin by binding to ubiquitin interacting domains in proteins or by forming thioester bonds with ubiquitin E2 or E3 enzymes. Additionally, ISG15 conjugation to Ubc13 on a lysine residue that is normally ubiquitinated has been reported to inhibit the E2 conjugating activity of Ubc13 [63], [64]. Thus, competing for target lysine residues is yet another mechanism by which ISG15 can antagonize ubiquitin.",

ASLV budding and release is dependent upon Gag binding to Nedd4 [60]. Despite the observed effects of ISG15 on Nedd4 in the Ebola studies, cotransfection of ISG15 with the ASLV Gag protein inhibited ASLV VLP release without disrupting the interaction between Gag and Nedd4. The disruption of Gag\u2013Tsg101 interaction in the HIV-1 study suggested that ISG15 is disrupting an early stage in the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway. Chimeric HIV-1 or ASLV Gag proteins fused to downstream ESCRT proteins can bypass early stages of the ESCRT pathway to facilitate VLP release [60]. However, in a study by Pincetic et al., it was found that ASLV Gag-ESCRT chimeras were still sensitive to ISG15-mediated inhibition [51]. ISG15 was found to prevent VLP release by inhibiting the recruitment of the AAA-ATPase Vps4 to the ESCRT pathway. This inhibition of Vps4 recruitment was dependent on charged multivesicular body protein (CHMP) 5 and correlated with ISGylation of CHMP5. However, other CHMP proteins were also found to be ISGylated in this study, and the mechanism by which ISG15 mediates this modulation of the ESCRT pathway was not conclusively shown.",

It is possible that these viruses are capable of antagonizing ISG15 and its effects on the ESCRT pathway. More studies will be needed to more precisely define the mechanisms by which ISG15 regulates viral budding.

Two studies showing that influenza A virus NS1 protein can be ISGylated by HERC5 have been published, and different functional consequences have been attributed to this modification [43], [68]. Both studies found that NS1 is ISGylated on more than one lysine residue. Zhao et al. found that the lysine residue at position K41 was the dominant site for ISGylation [68]. Modification at this site was shown to have no impact on the ability of NS1 to bind to double-stranded RNA but did inhibit its ability to interact with importin \u03b1, an interaction involved in the nuclear translocation of NS1. A recombinant influenza A virus containing the K41A mutation in its NS1 protein to reduce ISGylation of NS1 was less susceptible to inhibition of replication by IFN as compared to a WT virus. Tang et al. found that seven lysines in NS1 had to be mutated to generate a non-ISGylated NS1 [43]. This study found that ISGylated NS1 could not interact with the N-terminus of protein kinase R (PKR), the RNA binding domain of NS1, U6snRNA, or double-stranded RNA. On a functional level, ISGylation of NS1 inhibited the ability of NS1 to antagonize the induction of ISGs by SeV infection, suggesting that ISGylation of NS1 would render influenza A virus more susceptible to the antiviral response. Differences in the findings of these two studies could be due to the different strains of influenza A virus that were used in each study. However, both studies further support the hypothesis that, by modifying viral proteins, ISG15 can directly antagonize virus replication.",

Using an HPV pseudovirus packaging system, Durfee et al. demonstrated that the expression of the ISG15 conjugation system led to the ISGylation of the HPV capsid protein, which then incorporated into released virus. ISGylation of HPV capsid protein correlated with a decrease both in the amount of virus released and in the subsequent infectivity of the virus produced in the presence of ISG15. This observation led to a model in which ISGylated capsid protein is incorporated into virions but results in an alteration of the geometry of the viral capsid. It is hypothesized that this change in the capsid structure then inhibits the infectivity of the released virus. As mentioned previously, Woods et al. also found that HIV-1 Gag protein can also be ISGylated by HERC5 [58]. It is important to note that direct causality of virus replication inhibition through viral protein ISGylation, as opposed to ISGylation of host proteins, was not verified with non-ISGylatable HPV capsid or HIV-1 Gag mutants. Nonetheless, these observations help to further an attractive model for ISG15 function that could help to explain how ISGylation of a small fraction of the total pool of a protein could lead to a large downstream effect on virus fitness. Homooligomerization of viral proteins is a universal necessity in viral genomes to facilitate virion formation and genome packaging. Future studies will be needed to determine if this model can be applied to other viral proteins such as matrix proteins or ribonucleoproteins.",

This reduction of RIG-I levels was not seen in UbE1L \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) further implicating the importance of ISG15 conjugation to mediate this phenomenon. The reduction of RIG-I protein levels correlated with a reduction in the intensity of the IFN response triggered by NDV [71].

A non-ISGylatable K69R, K159R PKR mutant did not exhibit constitutive activation demonstrating that this RNA-independent activation of PKR was due to ISGylation of PKR.

For example, as previously discussed, ISGylation of CHMP5 has been correlated with the ISG15-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 budding [52]. ISG15 has also been implicated in the regulation of IFN-induced apoptosis through modification of filamin B [73]. In addition to cross-linking actin filaments, filamin B also serves as a scaffold protein for the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Jeon et al. has shown that ISGylation of filamin B disrupts its ability to bind to RAC-1, MEKK1, and MEKK4, thereby inhibiting the signaling cascade leading to JNK-mediated apoptosis [73]. In this study, coexpression of UbcH8 and filamin B resulted in co-localization of the two proteins in actin-rich membrane ruffles. Thus, while only a small fraction of total filamin B is ISGylated, the fraction of ISGylated filamin B within the local microenvironment of a membrane ruffle might be quite high. This might explain how ISGylation of a seemingly small fraction of filamin B can have a large impact on JNK signaling.",

Analysis of cells from ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 and UbE1L \u2212/\u2212 mice did not reveal any misregulation of STAT1 activation or ISG induction after stimulation with IFN\u03b2, LPS, or combinations of both stimuli [14], [45]. PolyI:C injections of mice had no effect on cell proliferation, and UbE1L \u2212/\u2212 cells were found to undergo similar levels of apoptosis after IFN stimulation. There could be several explanations for these discrepancies including (1) the differences in utilization of overexpression, knockdown, and knockout systems; (2) differences between the function of ISGylation in humans and mice; or (3) differences in experimental conditions and types of stimulations. Additional studies will be required to better understand these discrepancies.",

In this study, ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 neonatal mice were found to be highly susceptible to infection with the re-emerging viral pathogen, CHIKV. However, UbE1L \u2212/\u2212 mice did not display increase lethality, indicating that the expression of unconjugated ISG15 was sufficient to protect these mice from CHIKV-induced lethality. The protective mechanism of ISG15 in this model was distinct from previous models that have been studied in that ISG15 did not appear to function as an antiviral molecule. Viral loads in all organs examined were the same in WT, UbE1L \u2212/\u2212, and ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Instead, the ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly higher levels of multiple cytokines in their serum, and death of the animals occurred in a manner consistent with a cytokine storm. Together, these data suggested that unconjugated ISG15 protected these neonatal mice from CHIKV-induced lethality through its ability to regulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The mechanism through which ISG15 regulates these responses and the cell types responsible for the increased cytokine production in this model are not known. A recombinant CHIKV engineered to express ISG15 was no less virulent than the WT virus in ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 mice. This suggests that unconjugated ISG15 may need to be expressed by non-infected cells or expressed before virus infection in order to mediate protection. It is also not certain whether intracellular unconjugated ISG15 or extracellular unconjugated ISG15 is responsible for the regulation of cytokines in this model. Future studies will be needed to address these important questions.",

Though ISG15 has no canonical signal peptide for release, T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, and epithelial cells have all been shown to release ISG15 after IFN stimulation in vitro\n[74]. In studying the potential role for this released ISG15, it was found that treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes with recombinant ISG15 resulted in specific proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells [75]. This expansion of NK cells was found to be due to the induction of IFN\u03b3 by T-cells. Recently, a study by Bogunovic et al. confirmed a role for unconjugated ISG15 in the stimulation of IFN\u03b3 production and correlated this function with increased disease susceptibility in humans [41]. In this study, ISG15 deficiency was identified as a potential predisposition for Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. These authors found that recombinant ISG15 induced IFN\u03b3 production by both NK cells and other lymphocytes. They went on to show that the levels of IFN\u03b3 produced after stimulation with recombinant ISG15 were greatly enhanced by co-stimulation of cells with ISG15 and IL-12. Whole blood cells from ISG15-deficient individuals produced decreased levels of IFN\u03b3 compared to cells from ISG15-sufficient individuals after stimulation with either mycobacteria alone or in combination with IL-12. Treatment of ISG15-deficient cells with recombinant ISG15 in addition to mycobacteria and IL-12 enhanced their ability to produce IFN\u03b3 to levels near ISG15-sufficient cells. These data indicate that released ISG15 may play an important role in IFN\u03b3 production during mycobacterial infection.",

ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited increased lethality compared to WT mice when infected with this \u0394E3L mutant vaccinia virus, and the mutant virus exhibited a ~ 25-fold increase in virus replication in ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs compared to WT MEFs.

In host proteins, OTU domains can contain ubiquitin deconjugation activity [32].

To date, influenza A virus NS1, influenza A virus M1, HPV capsid, and HIV-1 Gag have all been shown to be ISGylated [25], [43], [58], [68]. Likewise, multiple studies have demonstrated a role for ISGylation of key antiviral ISGs, suggesting that ISG15 conjugation is important for proper regulation of the host antiviral response. Understanding this relationship between ISGylation and protein translation may play a key role in future discoveries of ISG15 functions. However, this observation also raises an important concern about the context within which ISG15 is studied. When possible, functional characterizations of ISG15 conjugation should be verified under conditions of endogenous protein expression.

Discrepancies between in vivo protection and cell culture phenotypes might be a result of the particular cell types chosen for study. However, it is also possible that ISG15-mediated protection from lethality might not be a result of direct antagonism of virus replication, as has been demonstrated for CHIKV infection [38]. To date, very little has been reported on the role of ISG15 conjugation in the regulation of the immune response. The initial characterization of ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 mice revealed no difference in the virus-specific T-cell response after infection of WT and ISG15 \u2212/\u2212 mice with LCMV [45].

            "text": "Finally, recent findings support the need for further investigation into the function of the unconjugated form of ISG15. Released ISG15 has been shown to modulate IFN\u03b3 production by multiple cell types and has been suggested to play a role in defense against mycobacteria [41], [75]. Unconjugated ISG15 also appears to regulate cytokine production after certain viral infections, though it is unclear if this is through the extracellular or intracellular form of ISG15 [38]. In addition to providing evidence that ISG15 may function to regulate the immune response, both of these activities suggest the presence of ISG15 specific binding partners. In the case of extracellular ISG15, the identification of a putative cellular receptor will be critical in better understanding the biological significance of extracellular ISG15. Intracellular ISG15 may also interact with other unidentified intracellular proteins independent of conjugation. Recent work in the ubiquitin field has demonstrated that unanchored ubiquitin chains can bind to innate signaling molecules such as RIG-I and members of the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade to influence signaling through these important pathways [83], [84]. This raises the possibility that other ubiquitin-like proteins could function in a similar manner. The body of research on non-covalent binding partners of ISG15 is quite small compared to the conjugation-dependent interactions, but these interactions may influence important biological processes. Uncovering potential binding partners for ISG15 will be instrumental in understanding its molecular mechanism of action.",

Both ubiquitin and ISG15 are conjugated to target proteins by utilizing enzymatic cascades composed of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. (a) In the case of ubiquitin, it achieves specificity in target protein modification through the use of multiple E2 and E3 enzymes, which can orchestrate a broad range of specific ubiquitin modifications. Ubiquitin can also conjugate to itself on multiple lysine residues to form polyubiquitin chains on target proteins that result in different downstream functional consequences for the targeted protein. (b) The ISG15 conjugation cascade is an IFN-induced cascade in which the vast majority of ISG15 conjugation utilizes UbE1L, UbcH8, and HERC5. Interaction between HERC5 and polysomes leads to the preferential ISGylation of newly translated proteins. Unlike ubiquitin, there is no evidence that ISG15 forms poly-ISG15 chains or targets proteins for degradation.",
