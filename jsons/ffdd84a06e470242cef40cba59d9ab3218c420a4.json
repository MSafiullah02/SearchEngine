The major neuropathological finding in AE, which developed within 6-12 days p i . consisted of necrotizing lesions distributed mainly in the grey matter of the central nervous system (CNS). SDE developed 14-30 days pi. and affected rats revealed lesions of primary demyelination with predilection sites in the white matter. The time-course for the development of lesions, virus replication and neutralizing antiviral antibody production within the first 3 weeks p.i. were studied. Within the first 2 weeks p.i., most rats showed no clinical signs but nevertheless revealed lesions typical of AE. In parallel to these neuropathological changes infectious virus could be isolated from brain and spinal cord. However, coinciding with multiplication of neutralizing JHM antibodies l(f12 days after infection no infectious virus was recoverable from CNS material. At this time many of the clinically healthy rats showed demyelinating lesions which were located at the typical predilection sites of SDE. These observations indicated that SDE was preceded by clinically silent AE lesions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Investigations of central nervous system (CNS) diseases in man and animals have shown that viruses can induce demyelination by various mechanisms (Weiner & Stohlman, 1978; ter Meulen & Hall, 1978) . One possible way is the direct effect of virus replication leading to destruction of oligodendroglia cells. In addition viruses, or their products, may cause demyelination by direct damage to myelin membranes, since fusion protein constituents of virus envelopes can drastically alter cell membranes. Besides these direct effects, demyelination may also develop as a result of an immunopathological reaction induced by the virus infection, as circumstancial evidence suggests in Theiler's virus infection in mice (Lipton & Dal Canto, 1976) . However, with the exception of oligodendroglial cell destruction by viruses, the detailed pathogenic mechanisms of virus-induced demyelination are still incompletely understood. Consequently, experimental virus infections with associated demyelinating CNS changes are of great interest for the evaluation of certain virus-cell and virus-host interactions. In this context CNS disease of rats caused by infection with the murine coronavirus strain JHM provides an important disease model for experimental analysis. Depending on the age of the animal and the biological properties of the virus inoculated either acute or predominantly subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis are produced (Cheever et al., 1949; Nagashima et al., 1978 Nagashima et al., , 1979 Sorensen, Percy & Dales, 1980; Sorensen et al., 1982; Wege et al., 1983) . In the following study experiments were carried out with JHM virus in weanling rats to determine the sequence of changes which lead to demyelination in order to provide a basis for future virological and immunological studies. The data obtained indicate that the subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis in rats is preceded by a clinically silent acute encephalitis.

Thus, SDE is preceded by clinically silent AE which is arrested and changed into a subacute form at a time when an antiviral immune response is first detectable. These antibodies may not only neutralize extracellular virus, but also influence viral growth. It has been shown in tissue culture experiments with different virus groups that a lytic viral infection can be changed to a persistent one in the presence of antiviral antibodies (reviewed by Rima & , Martin, 1976) . Antibodies inhibit not only the spread of virus and infection of neighbouring cells, but also the expression of viral antigen. In cell lines persistently infected with measles virus it has been shown that antibodies against measles virus act a t the cell membrane, modulate the expression of viral antigen and block the development of cytopathic effects (Joseph & Oldstone, 1975) . Similarly such effects may occur healthy rat (21 days pi.) in the within the plaque.
