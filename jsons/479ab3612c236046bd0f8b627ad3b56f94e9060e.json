Previous studies have showed evidence for person to person transmission of the 2019-nCoV in family and hospital settings. [3] [4] [5] Clinical features of 2019-nCoV, which appeared to be similar to SARS-CoV leading to high possibility of ICU admission and high mortality, were fever, fatigue, dry cough, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 6 As of March 8, 2020, 80859 cases were identified, and 3100 death cases were recorded in China. The number of identified cases in other countries were 25208, and 532 death cases were recorded. The number of newly confirmed cases overseas is still growing, especially in South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and Germany. 2019-nCoV outbreak becomes a greater global threat than terrorism. Although the fatal rate of 2019-nCoV was less than SARS-CoV ( 10% mortality) and MERS-CoV (37% mortality), the confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV were higher than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 7-12 .",

Previous study showed that patients with DM were susceptible to developing infections with lower (but not upper) respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. 25 Another study demonstrated that patients with diabetes were more likely to be admitted to hospital with infection compared with patients without diabetes. 26 Former study showed that infections were more serious in older people with type 2 diabetes. 27 A meta-analysis of 97 prospective cohort studies showed that patients with diabetes have a higher risk of death from all causes compared with patients without diabetes. 28 Previous study demonstrated that the prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus were 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-8.7%) in 45-54 years age group, 11.0% (95% CI 9.0-13.0%) in the 55-64 years age group in China. 29 Another study showed that the age-standardized prevalence of total diabetes were 9.7% (10.6% among men and 8.8% among women), which was similar with the prevalence of DM in 2019-nCoV Patients (9% ,95% CI 6%-12%) and the overall prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus( 9.1%). 29, 30 The prevalence of diabetes were 20.4% in the more than 60 years age group, which was slightly higher than the prevalence of DM in severe patients with 2019-nCoV whose median age were 56.5 years (17%, 95% CI 13%-21%). 30 However, our research has some limitations. First, we did not perform subgroup analysis due to many of the included studies did not divide the participants into different groups for outcome analysis. Second, all the studies in this Meta-analysis were retrospective with obvious heterogeneity, we adopted random-effects in meta-analysis to solve this problem. Third, because our study is the single-arm meta-analysis without a control group, causality is hard to determine. Fourth, because all included studies were retrospective studies, and most of them did not have age groups. We also 8 cannot obtain the data of the age of 2019-nCoV patients with diabetes mellitus from all included studies. We did not perform age adjustment analysis in this study.",
