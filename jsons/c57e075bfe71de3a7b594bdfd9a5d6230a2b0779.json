At the same time, specific prevention and prophylaxis information started to be given to IVIRMA staff both in Italy and Spain for patients coming from these Italian areas. Since the situation in Italy did not improve, and in anticipation of a possible lock-down of the country (which occurred on March 9th), restrictive measures were expanded to any cycle of a patient coming from Italy to be performed in Spain. These restraints included the halt of most oocyte donation treatments and all embryo transferences from Italian patients, recommending a \"freeze-all\" strategy and a later embryo transfer when the situation has normalized.",

In order to successfully develop this proposal, it is necessary to optimize the recovery of oocytes in a single retrieval and having facilities and qualified staff that guarantee the achievement of excellent results in vitrification and later thawing. Moreover, as established by FDA Statement on Feb 14 th , while respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer of human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), the potential for transmission of COVID-19 by these means is unknown at this time. There have been no reported cases of transmission of COVID-19 via these products. Our rationale is that Assisted Reproduction treatments are not via contagion for respiratory viruses.",

The latest researches provide some insight into the clinical characteristics, pregnancy outcomes and vertical transmission potential of Covid-19 infection in pregnant women (Chen et al.,2020; Rasmussen et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) ; despite the fact these publications include a small sample size, these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice . It remains to be seen during the current epidemic which factors modulate obstetrical disease and outcomes including the timing of maternal exposure by gestational age, the effects of medications or other treatment regimens, differences in host immune responses, occurrence of coexisting medical and obstetrical conditions, and other covariables (Schwartz and Graham, 2020) .",

We have been extrapolating clinical outcomes of SARS and MERS in pregnant women with Covid-19. Although is widely described that in pregnant women, pneumonia, regardless of its etiology, has a higher complication rate that in the general population, the next question we must ask ourselves is what is the proportion of pregnant women infected with Covid-19 who have developed pneumonia (confirmed and unconfirmed cases), considering the large number of probable cases that have not been diagnosed. According to WHO reports, the overall mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2.9% (2247 in 76769); however, the mortality rate varied among studies.The differences in the results among different studies could be due to the study population, as well as the differences among the studies in terms of disease severity. Up to date, there are no reported deaths in pregnant women with Covid-19, while in the cases that have presented pneumonia because of Covid-19, the symptoms have been moderate and with a good prognosis in recovery .",

During this current outbreak, there are very few reported cases of neonatal infection with Covid-19. In considering whether these and future cases of neonatal infection are acquired prior to delivery, it is important to remember that newborn infants can acquire an infection in other ways beyond intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission (Schwartz and Graham, 2020 .

As we can see, since the implementation of the first measures because of the pandemic, the decline has been progressive during the month of February followed by a pronounced drop in activity since March 10 th , a date almost coinciding with the declaration of the state of alarm in Spain; on the other hand, and as we expected, the number of fertility preservation procedures increased gradually as the rest of treatments decreased, according to the recommendations established by the different scientific societies. These data could be considered a reflection of the acceptance that our recommendations have had among our patients. Another point to consider is how these containment measures can affect infertile patients and the impact in the short-medium term on their opportunities to become mothers. Due to the pandemic and the lack of awareness of its immediate consequences on reproduction, some scientific societies such as American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM, 2020) have classified certain Reproductive Medicine procedures as elective or non-urgent; this definition has generated a great controversy since it underestimates the importance of the time for some specific sectors of the population such as women with advanced maternal age and/or diminished ovaria reserve.
