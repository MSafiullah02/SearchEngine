While acknowledging the limitations, in this article, I seek to summarize what is known or what can reasonably be inferred about an important subtopic of the microbiology of the built environment. The title \u2018indoor bioaerosol dynamics\u2019 is meant to imply that we seek a mechanistic, quantitative description of the processes and outcomes regarding the microbiology of the built environment, centering on what is, was, or will be airborne.",

            "text": "There are many reasons to be interested in the microbiology of the built environment. The context for this study derives from three primary concerns. First, exposure to bioaerosol material can cause or can contribute to many important diseases. Second, adverse respiratory symptoms correlate well with indicators of indoor dampness (Fisk et al., 2007). It is a reasonable hypothesis, although not yet well established, that the underlying cause of these associations is microbial. Third, the microbiology of spaces we occupy may influence the human microbiome in ways that could confer health benefits. Evidence for this last point is admittedly thin. There is growing evidence that people influence the microbiology of the spaces they inhabit (e.g., Lax et al., 2014). Emerging evidence also indicates that some aspects of the human microbiome are important for health (Grice and Segre, 2012). We further know that aspects of our personal microbiome can be influenced by individual factors such as diet and illness. So, it is not a large stretch to imagine that elements of our personal microbiome that matter for health might in fact be influenced by attributes of the spaces we inhabit, including their microbiology generally and their bioaerosol aspects specifically. Hanski et al. (2012) reported evidence supporting an analogous suggestion: \u2018rapidly declining biodiversity may be a contributing factor to \u2026 the rapidly increasing prevalence of allergies and other chronic inflammatory diseases among urban populations\u2026.\u2019",

The section outlines the use of a material balance as a first\u2010principles method for linking process to outcome for indoor bioaerosols. The size of particles is described as a primary variable of concern. Regional deposition of bioaerosol particles in the respiratory tract is described as a process linking concentrations and exposure to dose. Opportunities and limitations for progress in understanding indoor bioaerosol dynamics are strongly influenced by measurement technology, so some of the key measurement methods are summarized.

We seek a mechanistic understanding because it provides a powerful basis for extrapolating from limited empirical evidence. We also seek to develop quantitative insight, because knowledge of the scale of processes and outcomes is essential as a basis for separating the important from the trivial. Some prior scholarly reviews cover similar topics (Burge, 1990; Douwes et al., 2003; Gregory, 1971; Spendlove and Fannin, 1983).

The analysis was culture based, so the results reflect number concentrations of viable airborne spores. Little information was reported on the sampling protocol; however, it seems likely that the measurements were based on short\u2010term sample collection. Also, little information was reported about the buildings in which these measurements were taken. The cumulative probability distribution functions (Figure 1) show that the data are well fit by lognormal distributions. The geometric mean outdoor concentration (493 CFU/m3) is about 6 \u00d7 higher than the geometric mean indoor concentration (79 CFU/m3). The indoor levels show considerably broader range of concentration than do the outdoor levels (GSD of 5.5 compared to 3.3). These data support an important general finding that \u2018in the majority of cases, indoor fungal aerosols are controlled by outdoor concentrations\u2019 (Burge, 2002). Note that the ratio of geometric mean concentrations, 0.16, lies well within the range 0.04\u20130.46 predicted by Riley et al.

Even for fungi, for which humans do not appear to be a major primary source, human activities play an important role, for example, in shedding particulate matter from our clothing or in suspending settled dust that can contain materials of fungal origin. Figure 4 illustrates this point using samples collected in the same ten houses as discussed in connection with Figure 3. In this case, only indoor air samples are considered. The ten houses are divided into two equal\u2010sized groups, sorted according to degree of occupancy (Chen and Hildemann, 2009b). Occupancy is used here as a surrogate measure of the intensity of human activity.

Among the considerations that limit its strict applicability are that some of the parameters on the right\u2010hand side are time dependent. If applied over short time intervals, one must also be concerned that accumulation, that is, the increase or decrease in the amount of bioaerosol in the indoor space, is not incorporated in equation (1). Also, on a time\u2010averaged basis, the equation is only approximately correct because it does not account for the possibility that time\u2010varying parameters may correlate in such a way that the average of the product is not the same as the product of the averages. A second key point is that some of the processes exhibit strong dependence on particle size. This aspect is addressed in detail in subsequent sections of the study. A third feature of this equation is that it implicitly assumes that the indoor space can be represented as well mixed. That is not always the case. Finally, the equation is specific to the particular schematic representation of the indoor environment depicted in Figure 6a. This configuration accommodates some common conditions in residences, such as air exchange by a combination of natural ventilation (Q\nN) and infiltration (Q\nL), and the potential presence of a central air distribution system (with flow rate Q\nR) for heating and cooling.

This range of diameters corresponds to six orders of magnitude in particle mass. In part because of the large range, size is a major determinant of indoor airborne particle behavior (Nazaroff, 2004). The behavior of larger particles is strongly influenced by their mass. Gravitational settling and inertial impaction are important deposition mechanisms. The smaller particles in this size range follow airstreams more closely. Transport mechanisms leading to the departure of smaller particles from air streamlines include Brownian motion. Generally, the efficiency of filtration, the likelihood of deposition somewhere in the respiratory tract, and the rate of deposition onto indoor surfaces are all considerably smaller for particles with diameters in the range 0.1\u20131 \u03bcm as compared with particles with diameters in the range 1\u201310 \u03bcm.",

The probability of deposition varies with particle size, with lung morphology, and with breathing characteristics. Figure 7, which is based on semi\u2010empirical modeling originally developed for radiological protection (Yeh et al., 1996), illustrates some of these features. In these model calculations, the respiratory tract is divided into three zones: the head region (NOPL), the tracheobronchial or conducting airways (TB), and the pulmonary or gas\u2010exchange region (P). The information presented in this figure reflects two dominant characteristics of the system. First, the three regions of the respiratory tract are exposed to bioaerosol particles sequentially. For the largest particles considered, the high deposition efficiency in the head protects the distal airways from exposure. Second, two different mechanism classes control particle deposition. The behavior of the larger particles is dominated by their inertia. Larger particles have a higher mass\u2010to\u2010drag ratio, and so the larger the particle, the more efficient the deposition. However, for submicron particles, inertial processes are relatively unimportant. For the smallest particles in this figure, Brownian diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism. This is a slow process, important only in the smallest airways: Deposition efficiency of 0.1\u20131 \u03bcm particles is small in the head region, yet substantial in the pulmonary region. Similarly, the deposition efficiency increases with decreasing particle size when Brownian diffusion dominates.",

As air flows into a building through a leak in the envelope, particles suspended in that airstream may contact a surface bounding the leak, adhere, and be lost from the airstream. The penetration factor, p, represents that portion of particles in the outside air that make it through the leaks to enter the indoor environment. Large particles may deposit because of gravitational settling or inertial impaction. Small particles may deposit because of Brownian motion. Figure 11 presents the results of model calculations showing how the penetration factor varies with particle size for idealized crack geometry. Different parameter values are assumed for the indoor\u2013outdoor pressure drop (4 or 10 Pa) and the height of the crack (0.1, 0.4, and 1.0 mm). An important message from this figure is that cracks must be quite fine for any meaningful attenuation of the airborne particles during infiltration. Specifically, penetration is essentially complete across the full diameter range 0.1\u201310 \u03bcm for any crack whose minimum dimension exceeds ~ 1 mm (given a 4 Pa or higher pressure drop and assuming that the flow channel through the crack is no longer than 3 cm). The distribution of leak dimensions in any real building is not known. However, it seems likely that a normal case would feature most of the infiltrating air flowing through cracks larger than 1 mm in minimum dimension. Hence, there is an expectation that p ~ 1 for bioaerosol particles.",

They then summarize what has recently been learned about the microbiology of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity, the reproductive tract, and the skin. However, they do not comment on the microbiology of the respiratory tract. Beck et al. (2012), in their review, note that, \u2018although the lungs were classically believed to be sterile, recently published investigations have identified microbial communities in the lungs of healthy humans\u2019. Lax et al. (2014) document that the microbes found in a home are distinctively related to the people who live in that home and that \u2018after a house move, the microbial community in the new house rapidly converged on the microbial community of the occupants\u2019 former house, suggesting rapid colonization by the family's microbiota\u2019. What is not yet clear, but seems plausible, is whether aspects of the human microbiome are strongly influenced by microbiological and other conditions in inhabited indoor spaces.",

It is feasible that airborne transport to and deposition on the human envelope influences skin microbiota (Adams et al., 2013).",

In this review, the principle of material balance has served to structure a relationship between bioaerosol processes and indoor concentrations, an important intermediate outcome. Further studies can be fruitfully pursued to better understand each of the input parameters that appear in the material balance equations. Research could also be undertaken to test the accuracy of and to refine as necessary the model equations themselves. Benefits would especially be anticipated from studies to better characterize and quantify indoor bioaerosol emission sources and the influencing factors.

That is a challenging proposition for several reasons, including largely independent educational tracks and funding agencies that\u2014at least in the United States\u2014do not embrace the nexus between the built environment and health.
