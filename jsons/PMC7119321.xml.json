International scholars have recommended that disaster responses by the nursing workforce should not rely solely on hospital nurses.5 Reliance on hospital nurses to respond to disasters may be problematic for 2 reasons. First, hospital nurses are always enlisted to respond to disasters and already have professional obligations to provide care for hospitalized patients. As a result, the workloads of hospital nurses increases and the effectiveness of the health care service in disasters is ultimately reduced. Second, the health care needs associated with a disaster are not limited to those encountered in a hospital setting; nursing expertise in public health, shelter care, treating minor health care problems, and managing acute exacerbations of chronic disease management is required as well.",

Health care needs for typhoon survivors include treatment for hypothermia and traumatic injuries and addressing the needs of an aging population dependent on routine care and treatment for chronic medical problems (eg, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases). Typhoons may also lead to disruption of water treatment and sanitation resources, resulting in increased potential for exposure to infectious diseases. After a typhoon, there is also an increased need for treatment of anxiety, anger, grief, and depression. Previous studies suggest that nurses who work in the community, for example, community/public health nurses, long-term care nurses, and school nurses, should take responsibility in all phases of disasters.7, 8 Community/public health nurses are expected to play critical roles in all phases of disasters, because disasters have substantial impacts on communities.9 The growing aging society has led to increased numbers of elderly people living in long-term care facilities; a number of global news stories have highlighted the vulnerability of these residents during and after disasters. Accordingly, nurses involved in long-term care are advised to be prepared to respond to disasters.",

Strategies for enhancing nonhospital nurses\u2019 participation in continuing education in disaster nursing, such as online courses, should be further explored.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 For instance, in the United States, the Medical Reserve Corps provides online training courses to help prepare local medical and nonmedical volunteers to assist during public health emergencies.11\n",

            "text": "The availability of a Taiwanese nursing workforce prepared to respond in all phases of a disaster is concerning. Health care services provided in Taiwan are primarily government funded. At present, 261,972 nurses work in Taiwan; 111,526 of these nurses (approximately 43%) work in hospitals. Only 58.5% of nurses are actively working in the nursing field.17 As in many other countries, Taiwan has a nursing shortage, with an annual workforce deficit of 5000 hospital nurses. A prior document addressed an effective public health emergency response need to incorporate hospital-based nursing resources because the patients who require the most time-sensitive and critical care will seek hospital care in any emergency. The hospital-based workforce and, particularly, hospital nurses, have the largest proportion of health care workers.18 Therefore, a nursing workforce shortage can have a negative impact on a hospital\u2019s capacity to respond to disasters and public emergencies.19 Accordingly, the influences of the nursing shortage on the nursing workforce response to disasters should be addressed and explored from policy, practical, and educational perspectives. Unlike other countries that have legal regulations and guidelines to release hospital nurses to respond to disasters, such processes that facilitate the allocation of the nursing workforce in response to disasters have not been developed in Taiwan. Without those regulations and guidelines, the existing nursing workforce deficits and professional obligations to provide care to hospital patients increase the difficulty of enlisting nurses to respond to disasters in Taiwan. Additionally, the 41.5% of Taiwanese nurses not working in nursing should be considered another valuable element in a community disaster response and be provided with relevant disaster nursing continuing education. Strategies to address this problem may include policies that enable nonworking nurses to be activated in a disaster, activation mechanisms, and proactive strategies that connect those nurses to disaster education.",

Media attention directs the public\u2019s and also nurses\u2019 attention to all phases of disasters. In Taiwan\u2019s previous major disaster experiences such as the 921 earthquake in 1991, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, the Morakot typhoon in 2009, the Formosa Water Park dust explosion in 2015, and Tainan earthquake in 2016, emergency/critical care nurses worked mainly in the response phase of the disaster, which garnered most of the media and public attention. This situation might lead to twofold misperceptions by nurses regarding responding to disasters: first, that nurses\u2019 roles and functions in responding to disasters are only in the \u201cresponse\u201d phase of the disaster, and second, that the immediate nursing response to a disaster falls primarily to emergency/critical care nurses, who are often reported by the media in the \u201cresponse\u201d phase. The media does not pay as much attention to the \u201cpreparation\u201d and \u201crecovery\u201d phases as it does to the \u201cresponse\u201d phase of a disaster. As a result, the roles and functions of other nursing specialties in the \u201cpreparation\u201d and \u201crecovery\u201d phases of disaster may be ignored.",

With less participation in disaster nursing education, nurses from other specialties might not have sufficient preparedness and competencies in responding to disasters. Thus, generic and specific courses for different nursing specialties that fulfill the needs of providing care to those vulnerable groups in all phases of disasters should be developed. Strategies that enhance the participation of different specialty nurses in disaster nursing continuing education should be considered a priority for nursing education development. Moreover, proactive measures should be taken to publicize the roles and functions of nurses in different workplaces and specialties in all phases of disasters.",

Emergency nurses have a vested interest in ensuring that the nursing community at large is well prepared to respond to major disasters. A common finding after many natural disasters is that individuals seek care in the emergency department when their health care needs could perhaps be better managed elsewhere\u2014for example, the worried well, obstetric concerns, dialysis, medications refills, chronic ventilator care, and exacerbations of medical or psychiatric problems. This situation may result in increased crowding in often already overburdened emergency departments, unrealistic nursing workloads, and perhaps potentially less than optimal care for patients with complex care needs who are not normally treated in an emergency department.",

They can participate in local and regional emergency preparedness exercises, encourage clients and staff to have a personal disaster plan, and develop backup plans for communication and medication delivery.22 The content of disaster nursing continuing education should be expanded to address all of the nursing specialties to enhance collaboration between emergency and other nursing specialties in different phases and settings of the disaster health care.",

In addition to educating nurses currently working in the nursing field, innovative strategies are needed that provide disaster nursing education to nurses who are not currently working in nursing. Disaster nursing education that is tailored to nurses working in different settings and specialties is needed as well to expand the spectrum of the nursing workforce that can respond effectively to a disaster. In addition, instruments used to measure the effectiveness of the continuing education in disaster nursing should be developed. Moreover, research is needed to explore factors influencing nurses\u2019 willingness to receive, and competencies cultivated by, disaster nursing education from educational, practical, and policy perspectives. Such research can guide discussion of the future direction of disaster nursing education in Taiwan and global nursing societies as well.",
