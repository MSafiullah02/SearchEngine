The term \u2018coronavirus\u2019 refers to the appearance of CoV virions when observed under electron microscopy, in which spike projections from the virus membrane give the semblance of a crown, or corona in Latin 2, 3. All coronaviruses share similarities in the organization and expression of their genome, in which 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 through nsp16), encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 1a/b at the 5\u2032 end, are followed by the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), which are encoded by other ORFs at the 3\u2032 end. CoVs are separated into four genera based on phylogeny: alpha-CoV (group 1), beta-CoV (group 2), gamma-CoV (group 3) and delta-CoV (group 4) (http://ictvonline.org/proposals/2008.085-122 V.v4.Coronaviridae.pdf). Within the beta-CoV genus, four lineages (A, B, C, and D) are recognized. Distinct from other beta-CoV lineages, lineage A viruses also encode a smaller protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE), which is functionally similar to the S protein [4].",

            "text": "In humans, CoV infections primarily involve the upper respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract, and vary from mild, self-limiting disease, such as the common cold, to more severe manifestations, such as bronchitis and pneumonia with renal involvement [15]. The first human coronavirus (HCoV) was isolated during 1965 from the nasal discharge of patients with the common cold and termed B814 [16]. Currently, six different CoV strains are known to infect humans. These include: HCoV-229E (229E), HCoV-OC43 (OC43), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), HCoV-NL63 (NL63), HCoV-HKU1 (HKU1), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [17]. 229E and OC43 are the prototype viruses from the two main HCoV lineages (Alpha and Beta, respectively) that cause 15\u201329% of all common colds, and are the best characterized [18]. SARS-CoV is the aetiological agent that was behind an outbreak of severe respiratory disease through China during 2002\u20132003 [19], and MERS-CoV is the pathogen responsible for an ongoing outbreak of severe respiratory disease centered in the Middle East since 2012 [20]. In this review, we first compare and contrast the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the known CoVs infecting humans, in which CoVs that cause mild to severe disease in humans are newly emerged from a zoonotic source. Second, we describe the ecology of CoVs, and highlight evidence for viral recombination between the different CoVs within animal populations, which may result in the generation of novel CoVs that are transmissible and lethal to humans. Finally, we summarize the phylogeny, evolution, and genetic recombination of CoVs in detail.",

Infections with NL63 typically result in mild respiratory disease similar to the common cold, characterized by cough, rhinorrhea, tachypnea, fever, and hypoxia, and resolve on their own [29]. Obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup, is frequently observed with NL63 infections. A study estimated that NL63 accounts for an estimated 4.7% of common respiratory diseases [26].

A typical disease course begins with fever, cough, chills, sore throat, myalgia, and arthralgia, followed by dyspnea and rapid progression to pneumonia 40, 41, 42, 43. Approximately one-third of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting. Acute renal impairment was the most striking feature of disease caused by MERS-CoV, which is thus far unique for human CoV infections 40, 44. Seventy-five percent of patients with MERS disease also had at least one other comorbidity, and patients who died were more likely to have a pre-existing/underlying condition [40]. Countries around the Arabian Peninsula are known to be endemic for MERS-CoV, and Saudi Arabia has reported the most cases, but since its discovery in 2012, cases have been occasionally exported to other countries through travel, sometimes causing clusters of secondary outbreaks (Figure 1B) [45].

However, masked palm civets from the wild or from farms without LAM exposure were largely negative for SARS-CoV [47]. This suggests that palm civets were an intermediate host, but not a reservoir for SARS-CoV [48]. Subsequent studies have shown that wild horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae family), which can also be found in LAM in China and served in some Chinese restaurants in Guangdong, China, have detectable levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV and a SARS-CoV-like virus (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV) 49, 50, suggesting a bat origin for SARS-CoV. An evolutionary relationship between coronaviruses and bats was proposed, in which the ancestor for SARS-CoV first spread to bats of the Hipposideridae family, then Rhinolophidae, then masked palm civets and eventually humans [51]. Recently, two new SARS-like CoVs were isolated in horseshoe bats, and these viruses showed the highest relationship to SARS-CoV from all known bat coronaviruses [52]. ORF8 analysis of the SARS-like CoVs in bats suggests that Chinese horseshoe bats are the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV 52, 53, and that intermediate hosts might not be needed for direct human infection, particularly for some bat SARS-CoV-like viruses [52].",

Subsequent studies on dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia [56], Qatar [57], and Egypt [58] show that live MERS-CoV can be isolated primarily from the nasal swabs of camels, showing that camels are potential source of MERS-CoV infection. However, many confirmed cases lack contact history with camels [59], suggesting direct human-to-human transmission, or through contact with a yet-to-be-identified animal species that is maintaining MERS-CoV. Studies on HKU4, a coronavirus of bat origin and the most phylogenically closely related to MERS-CoV, had shown that HKU4 is able to utilize the CD26 receptor for virus entry [60]. As CD26 is a known receptor for MERS-CoV [61], the similarity in receptor specificity of these two CoVs supports the hypothesis that MERS-CoVs is also a bat-originated CoV. However, live MERS-CoV has not been isolated from wild bats, nor have viral sequences been detected.",

Furthermore, multiple lineages of circulating MERS-CoV in these camels had resulted in a dominant, recombinant MERS-CoV strain that was responsible for the MERS-CoV outbreaks during 2015 [62]. These results show that various CoVs of human and animal origin are currently circulating in the wild, providing ample opportunity for CoVs to undergo evolution and genetic recombination, thereby resulting in recombinant CoVs that may potentially be more deadly to humans. In the following sections, we summarize the evolution and genetic recombination of the current HCoVs.",

Genotype E, identified in 2014, emerged by recombination amongst the genotype B, C, and D viruses with different breakpoints in the genes compared to the generation of genotype D [76] (Figure 4). A study in France, between 2001 and 2013, demonstrated that OC43 strains have more recombination patterns in Lower Normandy, and circulating OC43 viruses have a high genetic diversity [17].",

With multiple species of CoVs circulating in the wild amongst different animal species that may constantly interact with one another, it is likely not a matter of if, but when, the next recombinant CoV will emerge and cause another outbreak in the human population. As such, some crucial future areas of investigation include: (i) the prevalence of HCoVs already circulating within the animal population, (ii) the commonality of coronavirus recombination in animals, (iii) animals which may potentially serve as mixing vessels for the generation of novel recombinant CoVs, and (iv) a surveillance network to monitor and predict the potential emergence of a highly virulent, recombinant CoV from animals (see Outstanding Questions). Furthermore, lessons from the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks must be urgently learned in advance to effectively prepare for the next CoV outbreak.Outstanding QuestionsHow common is coronavirus recombination in animals?Can coronavirus undergo recombination in animal hosts other than camels?Is there a way to predict the potential emergence of a novel recombinant coronavirus in the human population?\n",
