On the one hand, failure to deal adequately with public health crises such as the contamination of drinking water in Walkerton, Ontario and the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, underscored serious deficiencies in the public health system. On the other hand, the role of public health expanded in health promotion and the primary prevention of chronic disease. Significant developments included, among others, the creation of the Institute for Public and Population Health as one of the Canadian Institutes for Health Research in 2000, and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the National Collaborating Centres for Public Health in 2004.1, 2 The Canadian Population Health Initiative, which has a particular focus on the social determinants of health,3 was launched in 1999 to provide information on the health status and the determinants of health among Canadians.4\n",

In addition, public health organization housing divisions or units dedicated to CDP activities became larger. These findings may reflect the changeability that characterizes the regionalized healthcare systems implemented in nine of the ten provinces during the 1990s.16 Changes to the regional model since 2004 ranged from consolidation of two or more health regions as in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador (2005), and New Brunswick (2008), to complete abolition of regional health authorities as in Prince Edward Island (2005) and Alberta (2008). Such structural transformation creates disruption in CDP programming through, and not limited to, loss of trained personnel, change and/or increase in workloads, increased uncertainty among public health practitioners (regarding differences in cultures between merging organizations) and the public (regarding level of community involvement in decision-making and planning).17, 18, 19 Further, there is evidence20 that sectors similar to CDP, which rely more on people than technology to deliver programs, do not achieve anticipated economies of scale following amalgamations. Most CDP activity is carried out by units within larger structures which focus primarily on health care services. As these structures expand, existing priority attributed to health promotion and disease prevention may erode and the resources for CDP prevention diverted to curative or treatment activities. Macro-level organizational theories21 postulate that the ability to obtain a stable flow of resources from the environment is a core determinant of the maintenance of infrastructure and the development of services within22, 23, 24 and outside competitive markets.25 Within the context of the preventive health system, these theories would imply that long-term stability in infrastructure is critical for the preventive health system to building capacity or even maintaining current levels.",

Although the most effective mix of user to resource organizations is not known, this trend raises questions about if and how CDP programs, policies and services reach the populations targeted.

The reasons for this are likely complex and may relate at least in part to changes in economic conditions and governmental priorities over this period. Our findings are, however, consistent with other studies of change efforts in health systems, which document weak linkages between intentions and results, and high levels of status quo preserving resilience.39, 40, 41 Resilience can be explained by many factors but two may be particularly salient. First, to ensure survival, organizations in highly institutionalized environments generally seek to conform to norms in their fields.41 Although they may slowly evolve, norms are rarely revolutionized, providing a strong foundation for immovability. An example in our context is evaluation capacity. Despite momentum toward evidence-based medical practice, evaluation is still not part of normative organizational capacity in Canadian public health organizations. Second, when there are barriers to workforce renewal, workers in the system remain to all intents and purposes the same. Barriers in the period studied may have included a limited supply of well-trained public health professionals coupled with a growing need for specialized public health expertise in CDP.",
