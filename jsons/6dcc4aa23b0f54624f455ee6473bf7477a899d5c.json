A label-free protein microarray biosensor based on imaging ellipsometry [1] has been developed, which combines the imaging ellipsometer with protein microarray and has properties of label free, high throughput and fast test [2, 3, 4] . Its principle is that each ligand as a sensing probe individually immobilized on each unit of a patterned surface in a microarray, specifically bind corresponding receptors with their affinity resulting in an increase of biomolecule mass surface concentration. The increase can be measured with an imaging ellipsometer to realize a protein test [5] . It has been used for the biomedical applications including tumor marker detection, hepatitis B test, virus detection and so on [6, 7] . At present, the need for the biosensor to be easily deployed in the field and practical environment is undiminished. However, such kinds of imaging ellipsometer are cumbersome, complex and costly, which limit their applications in field monitor and on site of care testing, a compact imaging ellipsometer with low cost and high accuracy is required. Here, we present a compact model as an effective instrument for protein microarray screening.",

Fig.1 gives the schematic diagram of a compact imaging ellipsometer which is based on the Polarizer -Compensator -Specimen -Analyzer (PCSA) configuration. A 530 nm LED with width 40 nm is used to provide a stable light source. The angle of incidence is set at 75\u00b0 close to the quasi-Brewster angle of Si substrate. With an optimal azimuth setting of polarization elements P, C and A for a high contrast of imaging, the detected intensity is approximately linearly proportional to the thickness corresponding to the surface concentration [8] , which provides a thickness resolution in a 0.1 nm order and a lateral resolution in micron. The field of view reaches to several square centimeters. The image captured by CCD is converted to digital and stored in 8 bit, 0 255 grayscale, the value in grayscale is proportional to the layer thickness on Si substrate. The digital image may be converted to the layer thickness distribution in 3 dimensions. For an image with over 10 5 pixels, the capture speed is about 25 frame/S. In practice, the average over more frames may improve the ratio of signal to noise. The volume of the compact model is 370\u00d7230\u00d7110 (mm3).The autocollimator is used simply to locate the sample for test. We use a micro fluidic system of protein microarray [9] to fabricate a sample with 8 protein units in microarray. The fabrication process is as the following:",

            "text": "(2) Protein microarray fabrication The 8 units on a microarray are selected to immobilize different proteins on modified surface by the interaction between carboxyl group on the silicon surface and amido group in protein. Each unit is a 2 mm by 0.5mm rectangle, and the interval between 2 units nearby is 1 mm by 1 mm approximately. As shown in table 1, Biotin at the concentration of 2.5mg/mL, IgG and Fib are assembled on column A, B and C for 10 minutes, respectively. Afterward, Anti-IgG antibody and anti-Fib antibody were added to their corresponding antigen units for 10 minutes, in order to ensure the recognition between them and the formation of antigen-antibody complex. Fig.2 . presents the image of the protein microarray sample in grayscale and in 3 dimensions, which is obtained by the compact model. Table 2 gives the value in grayscale averaged over each unit of the protein microarray which corresponds to the layout, the roughness in each unit corresponding to the surface concentration of proteins. Due to the oblique incidence of the imaging ellipsometer, there is a difference of magnification between X and Y axis of image so that an image of each unit like a square corresponding to a rectangle unit in the protein microarray. We could see the image in good contrast and definition with obvious gradient in grayscale to visualize protein adsorption Compared with adsorption monolayer on B1 C1 units B2 B3 and C2 C3 with binding complex layers of antigen and antibody upon their affinity, so the larger mass surface concentration than monolayer and the higher in grayscale, which shows that it is possible to distinguish biomolecule interactions. To show the repeatability, we perform the same protein interaction in the lines 2 and 3 and get results in a good agreement. There are some dots with grayscale values much different from other neighbors', which means local pollution during the fabrication seen clearly. This is another advantage of the distinct power of the compact model. Some more protein microarray specimens are screened with the compact system to verify the validity of the device used in the biosensor. The experiment results show that the mono-layer of Biotin even with a molecule weight of 244 D, and protein complexes due to protein interaction are all quantitatively acquired with a high resolution. Furthermore, the visual result of 48 areas in protein microarray shows that a variety of target molecules can be quickly measured at the same time with acquisition time less than 1 s, so it is demonstrated that the compact instrument is able effectively to screen the protein microarray with label-free, and has a promising potential for practical applications of the biosensor on site of care testing.",
