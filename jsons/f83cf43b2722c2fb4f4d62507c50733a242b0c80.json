A genetic error of the respiratory cilia (9 + 2) is the cause of the airways disease named immotile-cilia syndrome (or PCD), whereas defective ependymal cilia (9 + 2) carries an increased risk of hydrocephalus. When the so-called nodal cilia (9 + 0) of the early embryo are malfunctioning, there is a random determination of asymmetry of the heart and visceral organs ('a 50% risk of situs inversus'). Some genes are responsible for the synthesis, transport, and assembly of the cilia, and mutations in these genes may lead to progressive degeneration of ciliary structures, such as the connecting cilium (9 + 0) of the photoreceptor cells -this is the cause of retinitis pigmentosa. Ciliary malfunctions due to genetic errors tend to be systemic and life-long, whereas acquired diseases are local and may be temporary only.",

Briefly, it is an assembly of nine microtubular doublets surrounding two central microtubular singlets. Each doublet has two rows of 'dynein arms', which contain the motor protein 'dynein'. The dynein arms are able to walk on the back of the neighbouring doublet, which results in bending of the cilium. There are also so-called nexin links, which are assumed to restrict the extent of sliding and to keep the array of doublets intact, and there are spokes (also called radial links) between the nine doublets and a 'central sheath', both probably with skeletal functions (Figure 1 ). The cilium emerges as an outgrowth from a basal body, which it resembles. The basal body is sometimes also named the centriole. It consists of nine microtubular triplets but has no central singlets.",

            "text": "(1) Mucus-propelling cilia. These are motile, have a 9 + 2 structure with dynein arms, and a length of about 6 \u00b5m. Typically, a large number of cilia (200 or more) project from the upper surface of a ciliated cell. Their function is to propel a mucus blanket that rests on the ciliary tips. This is done with a to-and-fro movement in which cilia in their effective down-stroke push the mucus blanket forward. The effected down-stroke lasts a third to a fourth of the length of the beat cycle and moves at that stage with a speed of 1 mm/s. The so-called respiratory cilia on the upper and lower airways are examples of mucus-propelling cilia [1, 2] . (2) Water-propelling cilia. These have a 9 + 2 structure with dynein arms and are motile. Their length is about 10-15 \u00b5m. A ciliated cell has one, two, or many cilia. The cilia on the ependymal lining of the brain ventricles and those in the efferent ducts of the testis or in the oviduct are of this type. (3) Nodal cilia. These have a 9 + 0 structure with dynein arms and are motile. They are short, about 5 \u00b5m in length. There is only one cilium per cell and it moves with a vortical beating pattern, 'like a propeller' [3] . They emerge and are active in the 7.5-day post-coitum embryo. (4) Monocilia. These have a 9 + 2 or a 9 + 0 structure, sometimes with dynein arms. They extend singly from the apex of a cell. In some cases, they appear on a cell that some days later will grow a number of mucus-propelling cilia, as in the trachea [4] , or grow water-propelling cilia, as in the urethra [5] ; they are then called primary cilia. In other cases, they are constant features; the thyroid gland has cells with monocilia that extend into the follicles and that have been hypothesized to stir the colloid in the thyroid follicle [6] . Another epithelium with monociliated cells is the corneal endothelium [7] . Another name for them is 'solitary cilia'. (5) Rudimentary cilia. These have a 9 + 0 structure without dynein arms and a length usually of about 2 or 3 \u00b5m. It is unlikely that they possess motility, also because they are often found cramped in solid tissues with no space for any movements. It is surprising to find single rudimentary cilia in the neurons and glia cells [8] , chondrocytes [9] , fibroblasts [10] , etc. It has been suggested that their function is to move the centriole/basal body away from the central cytoplasm and thereby prevent the cell from dividing. Alternatively, they carry some receptor or they have no function. (6) Olfactory cilia. These have a short basal portion (about 1.5 \u00b5m) with a 9 + 2 structure, probably without dynein arms, and a long distal portion (maybe 50 \u00b5m) with only a few microtubular singlets [11] . There are about 20 olfactory cilia on the apical portion of the olfactory cell. The olfactory cilia carry odour receptors in their cell membrane. (7) Photoreceptor cilia. These have a 9 + 0 structure without dynein arms and form a 'connecting cilium' between the inner and the outer rod segment (or between the inner and outer cone segments) and its continuation in the outer segment of the visual cell [12] . The outer segment contains membrane disks with visual pigments. (8) Sperm flagellum. The sperm tail has a 45 \u00b5m long cilium with dynein arms. It moves by a meandering movement, a flagellar motility that differs from that of a cilium.",

The name 'primary ciliary dyskinesia', abbreviated PCD, was proposed for the syndrome. In a third category of people, no cilia were found at all and neither the term immotile-cilia syndrome nor primary ciliary dyskinesia seemed suitable.

After about 1 day, the cilia are shed and after several more days, new cilia emerge.

In a paper from 1998, Nonaka et al [3] showed that the 7.5 post-coitum mouse embryo indeed carries cilia with the function to determine the sidedness of the forming heart and that these cilia are located in the closing neural tube; they were named nodal cilia. The nodal cilia create a leftward stream over the node of a fluid that presumably contains a morphogenic factor, which specifies the location of the forming heart. In mutants of mice, which lack such nodal cilia, the heart will be formed at the left or right side in equal proportion. In a second, important paper, Nonaka et al showed that the positioning of the heart can be determined at will by applying a motor-driven stream of the extra-embryonic fluid over the node [28] . An 'inheritance of randomness' is a rare but not unique phenomenon; it also acts in the left-or right-handedness [29, 30] .",

The cilia are wonderfully resistant to many of these agents but will undergo changes under other conditions. The cilia may thus become immotile, dysmotile, be shed from the cell, or they may become flaccid, matted, clumped together, or harmed in numerous other ways. It is difficult to decide, from an inspection of the cilia by light microscopy or electron microscopy, whether a certain biopsy of the respiratory epithelium shows cilia with primary or secondary immotility, dyskinesia, or loss. It seems, however, that certain defects, such as a complete lack of dynein arms, are diagnostic for the immotile-cilia syndrome.",

If infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis or B. bronchiseptica bacteria, a derangement of the so-called 'ciliary necklace' (four or five rows of intramembrane particles at the neck region of the cilia) will be seen [76] [77] [78] . This disruption leads to ciliary dyskinesia or stasis, presumably due to an interference with the axonemal calcium ion control rather than due to a defect of the axoneme itself. A differential diagnosis of the ciliary immotility -inborn or acquired -can be performed with the technique by Jorissen et al [26] , as explained above.",

However, they can be affected by vitamin A deficiency [81] in the same way as the respiratory cilia and can also be infected by viruses such as the mumps virus or various types of influenza virus [82, 83] . Evidently the first step of the infection is replication of the virus in close vicinity to the cilia. This leads to a loss of most cilia -to a considerable thinning of the ciliary forest. As a consequence hereof, there are no cilia to prevent particular matter from settling down on the ependymal surface [84] . The epithelial lining of the aqueduct is therefore destroyed and in nature's attempt to heal the breach, glial cells will cover the aqueduct, which results in stenosis and, as a consequence hereof, in ventricular enlargements and in hydrocephalus. Possibly neuroamidase released from invading neutrophils and macrophages play a role here [85] . Alternatively, the disturbances of the infected ependymal cells may cause early ventricular dilatations to appear before an aqueduct stenosis has occurred [83] .",
