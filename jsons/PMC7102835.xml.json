The aim of influenza surveillance is to provide timely and good quality epidemiological data and viral isolates to monitor trends, detect new strains, assess risk groups for infection and severe outcomes, and support the selection of influenza strains for vaccine production [2]. The Regional Office implements activities in collaboration with countries, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Naval Medical Research Unit Three. Strengthening laboratory and surveillance (L&S) capacities contributes to pandemic preparedness as outlined in WHO\u2019s guidance on pandemic influenza risk management [3], and more broadly, enhances core capacities as required under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) [4].",

From 2014 to 2017, PIP funds for these five areas of work were implemented in line with a partnership contribution implementation plan [6]. For L&S capacity-building under the implementation plan, WHO implemented activities globally and in each region to support all countries in pandemic preparedness.

The number of influenza specimens tested and reported to WHO\u2019s FluNet/EMFLU from participating influenza laboratories increased significantly from 44,563 (2014) to 74,043 (2017). To monitor the accuracy and reliability of influenza PCR testing, WHO encourages participation in its global External Quality Assessment Programme (EQAP) [8]. The number of countries participating in this programme remained stable from 2014 to 2017. However, by 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of countries correctly identifying all influenza viruses in the EQAP panel from 9 countries scoring 100% in 2014 to 15 countries in 2017. During the same period, 13 countries were visited to assess the laboratory capacities and to provide technical support and hands-on PCR training workshops. The provision of technical expertise through training, mentoring and exchange visits to WHO collaborating centres, as well as the provision and maintenance of essential equipment and reagents, has contributed to this achievement. Improved laboratory diagnostic capacities enable detection of influenza viruses with pandemic potential, and can bolster virus sharing with GISRS for further characterization and risk assessment. This is in line with the objectives of the PIP Framework to strengthen protection against pandemic influenza by improving and strengthening GISRS.",

In 2014, none of the countries of the Region had central or periphery rapid response teams. By 2017, all 22 countries of the Region, including all PIP priority countries, had rapid response teams established and trained at the central level. Of the 22 countries, 15 (68%) had also established multisectoral rapid response teams at the subnational level to facilitate rapid localized response to disease events.

            "text": "Estimating influenza disease burden is one of the priority areas of work under the four-year implementation plan [6]. Burden of disease data are used by countries to develop evidence-based policies including for pandemic influenza response. WHO guidance provides efficient methods to estimate the burden of disease using surveillance data [15]. By the end of 2017, nearly one-third of countries (seven out of 22) in the Region had estimated their disease burden including three L&S PIP priority countries. Five countries have already published their findings (Egypt, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Lebanon, Oman and Tunis) [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20]], while the manuscripts from Jordan and Morocco are under peer-review. National disease burden estimates can now be used by countries to inform pandemic influenza policy such as for risk-group identification and response measures required. The national estimates have also been used to develop updated global burden estimates. These are important achievements given the comparatively recent expansion of influenza surveillance systems in the Region to generate the necessary data for burden estimation.",

Several countries in the Region are yet to share influenza surveillance data with regional or global WHO platforms, or to share viruses, including influenza viruses with pandemic potential, in a timely manner with WHO collaborating centres. Timely information and virus sharing are critical to rapidly detect changes in the virological, clinical or epidemiological patterns associated with influenza and to quickly implement seasonal or pandemic risk management measures. WHO continues to work with countries to address these gaps through meetings, technical support and by encouraging countries without NICs to designate a national laboratory so that there is dedicated participation in GISRS and global information- and virus-sharing. In 2017, WHO also published practical guidance for countries on sharing influenza viruses [24,25]. The WHO Regional and Country Offices will continue to advocate for the application of the guidance especially as the sharing of influenza viruses with pandemic potential constitutes a key component of the PIP Framework.",

The establishment of EMFLU for data management and the ongoing surveillance capacity-strengthening efforts by WHO and other partners will help countries to better utilize surveillance data. Many countries do not have a seasonal influenza vaccine policy.
