In an early work, Kruegel et al. [4] through his research which leveraged statistical methods with control flow graphs concluded that the task of function start identification can be trivially solved for regular binaries. However, later research in [14] argued that this task is non-trivial and complex in some specific cases wherein it is too challenging for heuristics-based methods to discover all function boundaries. Other influential works and tools that rely on signature database and structural graphs include IDA Pro, Dyninst, (Binary Analysis Platform) BAP, and Nucleus [1]. Andriesse et al. [1] has recently proposed a new signature-less approach to function detection for stripped binaries named Nucleus which is based on structural Control Flow Graph analysis. More specifically, Nucleus identifies functions in the intraprocedural control flow graph (ICFG) by analyzing the control flow between basic blocks, based on the observation that intraprocedural control flow tends to use different types and patterns of control flow instructions than inter-procedural control flow.",

The seminal work of [11] modeled function start identification as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) in which binary offsets and a number of selected patterns appear in the CRF. Since the inference on a CRF is very expensive, though feature selection and approximate inference were adopted to speed up this model, its computational complexity is still very high. ByteWeight [2] is another successful machine learning based method for function identification aiming to learn signatures for function starts using a weighted prefix tree, and recognizes function starts by matching binary fragments with the signatures. Each node in the tree corresponds to either a byte or an instruction, with the path from the root node to any given node representing a possible sequence of bytes or instructions. Although ByteWeight significantly outperformed disassembler approaches such as IDA Pro, Dyninst and Binary Analysis Platform (BAP), it is not scalable enough for even medium-sized datasets [12].",

The study in [12] is the first work which applied a deep learning technique for the function identification problem. In particular, a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (Bidirectional RNN) was used to identify whether a byte is a start point (or end point) of a function or not. This method was proven to outperform ByteWeight [2] while requiring much less training time. However, to address the boundary identification problem with [12], a simple heuristic to pair adjacent function starts and function ends was used (see Section 5.3 in that paper). Consequently, this approach is not able to efficiently utilize the context information of consecutive bytes and machine instructions in a function and the pairing procedure might lead to inconsistency since the networks for function start and end were trained independently. Furthermore, this method cannot address the function scope identification problem, the hardest and most essential sub problem in function identification, wherein the scope (i.e., the addresses of all machine instructions in a function) of each function must be specified.",

            "text": "Inspired from the idea of a Turing machine, we imagine a memory tape consisting of many cells on which machine instructions of a binary are stored. The head is first pointed to the first machine instruction located in the first cell. Each machine instruction is assigned to an action state in the action state set {NI, NE, FE} depending on its nature. After reading the current machine instruction and assigning the corresponding action state to it, the head is moved to the next cell and this procedure is halted as we reach the last cell in the tape (see Sect. 3.1). Eventually, the sequence of machine instructions in a given binary is translated to the corresponding sequence of action states. Based on this incentive, in this paper, we propose a novel method named the Code Action Network (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text {CAN}$$\\end{document}) whose underlying idea is to equivalently transform the task of function scope identification to learning a sequence of action states.

The proposed CAN can tackle binaries for which there exist external gaps between functions and internal gaps inside functions wherein each internal gap in a function does not contain instructions from other functions. By default, our CAN named as CAN-B operates at the byte level and can cope with all binaries that satisfy the aforementioned condition. However, for the binaries that can be further disassembled into machine instructions, another variant named as CAN-M is able to operate at the machine instruction level. CAN-M can efficiently exploit the semantic relationship among bytes in an instruction and instructions in a function as well as requiring much shorter sequence length compared with the Bidirectional RNN in [12] which also works at the byte level. In addition, our proposed \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text {CAN}$$\\end{document}-B and CAN-M can directly address the function scope identification task, hence inherently offering the solution for other simpler tasks including the function start/end/boundary identifications.",

The experimental results show that our proposed CAN-B and CAN-M outperform the baselines on function start, function end and function boundary identification tasks as well as achieving very good performance on function scope identification and also surpass the Nucleus [1] on this task. Our proposed methods slightly outperform the Bidirectional RNN proposed in [12] on the function start and end identification tasks, but significantly surpass this method on the function boundary identification task \u2013 the more important task. This demonstrates the capacity of our methods in efficiently utilizing the contextual relationship carried in consecutive machine instructions or bytes to properly match the function start and end entries for this task.

The internal gaps in general might contain data, jump tables or instructions from other functions (e.g., nested functions). We further assume that the internal gaps do not contain any instruction from other functions. It means that if there exist functions nested in a function, our CAN ignores these internal functions. However, we believe that the nested functions are extremely rare in real-world binaries. For example, in the experimental dataset, we observe that there are only 506 nested functions over the total of 757,125 functions (i.e., the occurrence rate is 0.067%).\n",

With the aforementioned assumption, the binaries of interest consist of several functions and the functions in a binary do not intermingle, that is, each function only contains its machine instructions, data, or jump-tables and do not contain any machine instruction of other functions. Each function can be therefore viewed as a collection of bytes where each byte is from a machine instruction of this function (i.e., instruction byte) or data/jump-tables inside this function (i.e., non-instruction byte). To clarify how to proceed over a binary function given a sequence of action states, let us imagine this binary program including many instruction and non-instruction bytes as a tape of many cells wherein each cell contains a instruction or non-instruction byte and a pointer firstly points to the first cell in the tape. The action state NI includes the current instruction or non-instruction byte in the current cell to the current function and moves the pointer to the next cell (i.e., the next instruction or non-instruction byte). The action state NE excludes the current instruction or non-instruction byte in the current cell from the current function and moves the pointer to the next cell.

F13 and F14 are then labeled as NI and NE respectively since F13 belong to the function Function 1 while F14 does not belong to any function, and the pointer moves to the instruction byte F15 and labels it as FE since it is the end of the function Function 1 and we need to start reading the new function (i.e., the function Function 2). The pointer subsequently moves to the instruction byte G2 and the non-instruction G3 which can come from a jump-table or data and labels them as NE since they do not belong to any function. The pointer then traverses across the instruction bytes F21, F22, F23 and labels them as NI, NI, FE. The pointer now starts reading the new function (i.e., the function Function 3). This process is repeated until the pointer reaches the last instruction or non-instruction byte and we eventually identify all functions.",

The advantages of performing the task of function identification at the machine instruction level include: i) the sequence length of the bidirectional RNN is significantly reduced and ii) the semantic relationship among bytes in a machine instruction and machine instructions can be further exploited. As a consequence, the gradient exploding and vanishing which often occur with long RNNs can be avoided and the model is easier to train while obtaining higher predictive performance and much shorter training times as shown in our experiments.",

This preprocessing step aims to work out fixed length inputs from machine instructions. For each machine instruction, we employ Capstone to detect entire machine instructions, then eliminate redundant prefixes to obtain core parts that contain the opcode and other significant information (see our Supplementary Material for details, available at https://app.box.com/s/iq9u8r).",

[2] commonly mentioned that for the functions that contain either several function start or function end styles inside, their models tend to confuse in determining the true start or end points, hence offering many false positives. This is due to a high level of ambiguity in the start or end entries for these functions. However, it is not the case for our proposed CAN-M and CAN-B. For example, at the machine instruction level with PE x86, we found that the functions which contain more than one function start style or function end style account for 98.38% and 28.00% of the testing set and when predicting these functions, our proposed CAN-M has 0.28% false negative rate and 0.24% false positive rate as well as 1.56% false negative rate and 1.09% false positive rate.Our proposed methods also share the same behavior as the method in [12] in predicting some first and last items in an input sequence, that is, the CAN-M and CAN-B sometimes offer false positives and negatives when predicting some first and last instructions or bytes in an input sequence. More specifically, if an input sequence involves several functions, the start of the first function and the end of the last function are more likely to be predicted incorrectly. This is possibly due to the scarcity of context before or after them. For example, at the machine instruction level with PE x86, we record that there is about 2.39% of input sequences which contain function ends at some first and last input items. When predicting these function end entries, our proposed CAN-M obtains 21.21% false positive rate and 27.27% false negative rate.\n\n\n",
