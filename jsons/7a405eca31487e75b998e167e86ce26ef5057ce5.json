We began the process of converting in-person HIV care visits to telephone or video conferencing calls immediately after the state of Illinois imposed a \"shelter in place\" order on March 21, 2020 [8] . To best meet the needs of our patients, our clinic utilized a two-tiered approach of either delaying visits several months in the future, or arranging virtual visits. During the first 4 weeks of the order (March 21, 2020 through April 17, 2020), 98 PLWH were scheduled for HIV care visits in our clinic. Of these, 2.0% (2/98) attended in-person visits, 21.4% (21/98) attended virtual visits with a member of the HIV care team, and 30.6% (30/98) rescheduled for a later date. Among the 45 PLWH who neither attended virtual visits nor were rescheduled, 60% (27/45) had a most recent HIV viral load (VL) < 20 copies/mL, 31.1% (14/45) had VL between 20 and 200 copies/mL, and 8.9% (4/45) patients had VL > 200 copies/mL. PLWH whose appointments were rescheduled or cancelled were more likely to have VL < 20 copies/mL than those who attended in-person or virtual visits (89.3%, (67/75) vs. 39.1%, (9/23)). This finding is encouraging, suggesting that providers prioritized visits with patients with detectable viral loads who were most in need of close follow-up. Ideally all patients would have the opportunity to connect with their HIV care providers, and we are in the process of reaching out to PLWH who neither attended visits nor rescheduled to arrange virtual visits.",

We have mobilized our behavioral health program to provide more frequent, brief tele-therapy supports to provide continuity of mental healthcare. Although some patients prefer in-person contact and have temporarily discontinued services, we have seen in an increase in participation from patients who historically have not engaged in therapy services. Our programs have also created interactive video conference workshops and question and answer sessions for patients and community members who do not want to engage in individual therapy, but are in need additional support during this time.",

Early reports from China suggest similar rates of infection to the rest of the population [24] . However, in the United States, many PLWH come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds who are more likely to work jobs considered essential and remain at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure during social distancing [25, 26] . Recent studies also suggest that COVID-19 is more common among African American and Latinx populations, groups with higher prevalence of HIV in the US [27, 28] . Additionally, comorbid diseases that are common among PLWH, such as cardiovascular disease may lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes [29] . Given the higher prevalence of comorbid conditions and membership in communities that suffer from structural inequities, it remains to be seen if PLWH suffer disproportionately from COVID-19.",

As we experience unprecedented financial stressors and necessary changes to our healthcare delivery system, we must adapt our care and services to continue to engage PLWH to avoid poor outcomes amongst our more vulnerable patients. Prioritizing patients who are not virally suppressed may serve as a successful strategy for preventing patients from falling off the HIV care continuum. Additional and timely resources are needed to provide rapid ART access and to combat food insecurity and homelessness. Healthcare services must be creatively adapted to support physical and mental health remotely to meet individual and community needs. While we are not currently seeing disproportionate COVID-19 among PLWH, we continue to monitor those outcomes. More research is needed to know the long-term implications of the pandemic for the health of people living with HIV.",
