Many critics (Garrett, 2000; Rhodes, 1998, e.g.) have argued that we put ourselves at great risk -in the United States and internationally -by continuously deprioritizing what is already an insufficient public health infrastructure. The rush to provide sufficient vaccine for H1N1 and seasonal flu in 2009 -in both North America and internationally -has demonstrated just how many infrastructural weaknesses there are.",

To imagine it as a robust system, one that can adapt to new situations and work throughout people's lives rather than the current notion of a heroic mechanism that sweeps in at critical moments to vanquish death and maintain the workforce, would constitute a major shift in policy goals and money allocations. This new and different type of long-term public health response likely would have more goals in common with the educational system or other institutions of civic infrastructure than with the military, making it a shift from the sorts of public programs that have historically received large amounts of funding in the United States, programs whose goals align with those of national security. We North Americans panicked over SARS and the permeability of our borders, and we panic over bioterrorism, to the surveillance of which our governments have given strong funding, but the US government, media, and mainstream population have been slow to worry about influenza. As the military prepares in peacetime for the possibility of wartime, it would make sense to make public health development a continuous, far-sighted endeavor that sees to everyday health concerns toward the end of also being prepared for outbreaks when they occur.",

We must expect to live with it for generations to come as well. Even ordinary influenza results in over 100,000 hospitalizations in the United States each year. Flu pandemics like the ''Spanish'' flu of 1918-1919, the ''Asian'' flu of 1957-1958 (which killed well over 1,000,000 people), the ''Hong Kong'' flu of 1968-1969 (which killed over 500,000 people), and this year's H1N1 are extraordinary in their transmissibility and adaptability (Snacken, Kendal, Haaheim, & Wood, 1999) , but influenza viruses mutate constantly. Pandemic flu is always a possibility and invariably stretches even good public health systems to their limits. This means that preparing for pandemic flu is a good test for health systems to gauge their readiness for any potential large-scale emergency, whether caused by a disease agent or natural disaster, and to integrate broad and robust prevention care with emergency planning.",

Philosopher Barry Hoffmaster, in his introduction to the volume Bioethics in Social Context, advocates attention to the practical implications of every biomedical ideal, to the ''fundamental matter of medical-moral responsibility' ' (2001, p. 4) . It is crucial to remember, especially in the midst of responding to a population-level panic over an infectious disease outbreak, that the welfare of individuals is at the heart of why the population they comprise matters.",

Governments have had ample warning, unlike the surprise of HIV/AIDS, that a new plague is coming. Indeed, Washington has had almost nine years to heed the advice of top influenza experts and mobilize the nation's resources to battle H5N1 in Asia and at home.

This report recommends a series of steps that the federal government should take, many in concert with governments of other countries, to reduce the threat to lives and the global economy. We believe a comprehensive plan would cost roughly $10 billion more than the $7 billion the U.S. Government has committed to spending already. This additional sum is less than 1/10th the amount the federal government has devoted to relief and recovery from Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, it is a tiny fraction of the more than $500 billion in lost output in the United States alone that a pandemic could cause. (2006, p. 8) However, several months on from the original recorded outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus in Mexico (this paper is being finalized in the autumn of 2009), it seems that pandemic flu has fallen short of the terrifying threat it seemed to promise. H1N1 has proven to be frightening and to be quicker moving, more virulent, and two to three times more likely to cause death than this year's seasonal flu, but, thankfully, it has not delivered the disaster of the major and deadly pandemic that many expected. Seasonal flu, meantime, continues to cause about 35,000 deaths per year in the United States and to cause widespread workplace shortages. What, then, distinguishes pandemic flu from the seasonal variety, and what makes influenza both so much a mundane part of everyone's life and a true disease threat? Pandemic flu is marked by its novelty (that it is caused by a strain not previously seen in humans), by its virulence, and by its ease of transmission. In the northern hemisphere in the fall of 2009, for example, pandemic H1N1 was outstripping all the seasonal flu strains with respect to its rate of spread and the likelihood that those who contracted the virus grew sick, often very sick.",

The 1918-1919 pandemic was widely referred to as the ''Spanish influenza'' because it was first reported in large numbers in Spain. Some contemporary theories attributed its origins to China (see ''The Influenza Pandemic of 1918'' at http://virus.stanford.edu/uda/), but it seems the first eruptions of influenza occurred on military bases in the American Midwest. A recent study conducted in London suggested the pandemic might actually have emerged in France, from the ecology of juxtaposed soldiers, gas, pigs, and fowl (Oxford et al., 2005) . The longstanding association of certain diseasesparticularly the flu -with nations, regions, or races (particularly Asians in the 20th century) is, I argue, part of why the United States and global public health bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO) were slow to respond to H5N1 virus in Hong Kong in 1997. Even since 2004, when H5N1 began to draw much international attention, there has been consistent debate about whether wealthier nations should rush resources to the source of an avian influenza epidemic -should that epidemic start in Asia or Africa -or wait until the virus reaches their borders.",

For vaccine programs to be effective at the population level, to achieve what infectious disease specialists refer to as ''herd immunity,'' a majority of the population (ideally, 60-70%) would need to be vaccinated. Even if enough vaccine could be produced, many people harbor suspicions about the possible side effects. In any case, it is difficult to produce enough vaccine because inoculation is not a profit-making branch of medicine and because vaccines need to be distributed inexpensively and are typically administered only once or twice (see, e.g., the World Health Assembly's 60.28 working paper, ''Patent Issues related to Influenza Viruses and their Genes'').",

This affects vaccination programs both because vaccine production cannot be lucrative and because the greed and wealth of many pharmaceutical conglomerates make people, and some governments, suspicious of them. Regarding the former issue, the 1976 flu vaccine controversy in the United States offers a cautionary tale. After an outbreak of swine flu at Fort Dix military base in New Jersey, the US government began an active, government-led, and subsidized campaign to inoculate the nation's population against the strain. President Ford's vaccination was photographed for publicity, and Congress earmarked US$ 137 million for the program. Soon after vaccinations began, however, the plan dissolved amidst controversy. The pharmaceutical manufacturers charged with making the vaccines demanded indemnification against possible lawsuits, raising public doubts about the safety of the vaccine. Then, some cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome developed in individuals who had received the swine flu vaccine. Although the number of cases was small (fewer than 50 such cases associated with all flu vaccinations between 1976 and 2006) and causality has never been determined, the co-occurrence confirmed the fears many people had, and the program ground to a halt (for an history of this event, see Sencer & Millar, 2006) .",

The scanners had provided some use in containing SARS because that disease is marked by a rapid fever spike. With influenza infection, the fever might come more slowly, and the ill individual is infectious before the fever begins. The first few months of the H1N1 pandemic also saw travelers the world over prone to being tested and quarantined on the basis of their point of origin, with Mexicans under surveillance first and then New Yorkers.

Because influenza is airborne, because infected individuals are contagious before they show symptoms, and because H1N1 proved to be particularly transmissible, it is not surprising that all these measures might have slowed its spread but could not stop it.

Again, because individuals with the flu are contagious before they show any symptoms, quarantines can, at best, only slow the spread of the virus. Once an individual is infected and ill, the fact that influenza replicates in mucus membranes means that face masks are not always practicable; the respiratory discharges, violent coughs, and difficulty breathing that are symptomatic of serious flu make it impossible to wear one. Even before one is ill, face masks are uncomfortable and usually too porous to block viral particles (Barry, 2005; Davis, 2005a) . Vaccines suit the common contemporary mindset about disease in that they seem to promise quick, efficient, and total protection from the effects of pathogens. Where no vaccine is yet available, the search for equally efficient and complete protection from pathogens continues. Quarantines and face masks at least offer this symbolically. The 2009's ubiquitous directives to carry hand sanitizer, to wash hand for at least 15 s, to smother coughs, and to stay home when sick work toward similar security. Each of these directives is a good idea, but none can fully diminish the risk of contracting flu.",

Airborne viruses, in particular, can pass from one person to another through a cough, even a smothered one, while they are waiting to go through customs or despite their very clean hands. These measures make sense, but they do more to reinforce individuals' need for some control and a feeling of security in the face of an epidemic than they actually enhance biosecurity. A critical aspect of our emphasis on these borders is, I argue, our reluctance to admit that we 21st-century humans remain a part of, and subject to, the natural world and, therefore, vulnerable to its diseases and predations just as it is to ours.",

Live bird markets are a concern because birds from many different sources are kept in very tight proximity to each other and because they are kept in conditions that create extreme stress for them, which reduces their immunity. In industrial meat and egg farms in the United States, we see the same issue. Animals bought from many different auctions, coming from different regions, are kept in extremely overcrowded and highly stressed conditions. As well, as Jean Halley discusses in her work on cattle ranching, industrially farmed animals are bred to have abbreviated lives -they are essentially born to die (personal communication, July 29, 2009 ). This means that animals can contract viruses and then be sent to slaughter before the viral infection begins to show visible symptoms. Richard Rhodes, in his book on mad cow disease, discusses how this compressed birth-to-slaughter time-frame makes it practically impossible to know if beef cows are infected or not, especially if the infectious agent at issue is a slow virus like the one that causes mad cow disease (1998). This matter of diagnosis is exacerbated by the fact that most animals that are industrially farmed for slaughter exist in such inadequate conditions that many of them are sick all the time. Most companies compensate for this by feeding them large doses of antibiotics as a common course. Aside from the concern about creating population-level antibiotic resistance, this practice has the added downside of the false but common American perception that antibiotics can cure everything (see, e.g., Andremont & Tibon-Cornillot, 2006) . They do not, certainly, provide any protection against viruses. So it was a reasonable -though not necessarily accurate -guess that the H1N1 virus may have been produced on an industrial pork farm in Mexico. In a Newsweek article in 2009, Laurie Garrett wrote about the inaccuracies and uses of referring to H1N1 as swine flu:",

However, many of the birds, dogs, and domestic cats that were culled in Southeast Asia in 2005 and 2006 were simply buried alive and conscious. The welfare of the animals may or may not seem important to everyone in the face of a pandemic threat, but its context is that many of these animals were household pets and that much of this culling was excessive, ineffective, and conducted in an unplanned and haphazard manner, almost more for metaphoric purification than as epidemiological strategy. The World Bank and FAO specify that compensating people for their animals is important, both to prevent local economic collapse and to encourage people to surrender animals when a cull is called for. The FAO guidelines suggest compensation at a rate of about two-thirds the animal's market value, which is a significant depreciation for a family that relies on its animals for part or all of its livelihood, and this two-third compensation is not always feasible or achieved.",

To the extent that it reduces the virus load, it also reduces the risk of the virus mutating to become transmissible from human to human.

Unless such practical plans exist, animal culls are more likely to cause harm than to contain influenza outbreaks. As domestic fowl and other animals were being culled in Turkey in 2005, for example, wild fowl carrying H5N1 were already migrating elsewhere. To return to Laurie Garrett's words, wise action would turn to ecology for its perspective, a viewpoint cognizant of how microbes, animals, and humans all function together and affect each other irrespective of the socially constructed borders (economic, national, and species) that fundamentally structure how most people conceive of the world but are meaningless on an animal or microbial level. For example, how does the ecology through which cheap meat is produced, killed, and distributed internationally produce new microbes and how does it increase the vulnerability of farmed animals and the workers at those farms, slaughterhouses, and warehouses? How do people and animals coexist and, in sharing space, also share the risk of influenza infection? Jeffrey Bussolini, translating and interpreting Roberto Esposito's Immunitas, describes how Esposito draws on Rene Girard's Violence and the Sacred to draw a parallel between the contemporary hopes for vaccines and the ancient practice of eliminating plagues by designating a scapegoat which is ''externalized'' by driving it, with the burden of the plague, outside community boundaries. As Bussolini told me, Esposito writes that the medical condition consists of inoculating a limited amount of the disease just as, in rituals, a little bit of violence (the burdening and driving out) is injected into the social body to prevent greater violence (turmoil within the community). Girard draws a link between this ancient form of managing violence and the modern act of inoculation. This injection (the inoculation) is a repetition of the sacrifices (as in the scapegoat) and, ''as in all types of sacrificial protection, naturally contains the possibility of a catastrophic inversion'' (personal communication, April 11, 2009) .",

It is fair and reasonable that we, as citizens, expect our governments to act responsibly and with foresight, to collaborate with other governments and with the private sector when necessary, and to dedicate sufficient funding and human expertise to developing preventative health systems that are practical, responsive, and functional and that are an integral aspect of everyday life as well as disaster preparedness.",
