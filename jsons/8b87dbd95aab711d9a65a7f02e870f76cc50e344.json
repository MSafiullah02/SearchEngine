Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohen's kappa (\u03ba) and Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for all positive results as a surrogate measure for viral load.",

SC was highly concordant with HC (\u03ba = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method (\u03ba = 0.959 vs 0.933). Mean SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and N-gene, rhinovirus and parainfluenza Ct values did not differ between HC and SCNT. Conclusions: Self-collection of throat and nasal swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces exposure of the community and health workers to those being tested and reduces requirement for PPE.",

[10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Wang et al reported that in 205 patients with COVID-19 the highest positive rates were found from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum and nasal swabs respectively. 15 Wolfel 14 and colleagues reported that in hospitalized cases of COVID-19 there was no discernible difference between NP and throat swabs with high viral load present in both specimens early in the illness and suggested that simple throat swabs may provide sufficient sensitivity when patients are first tested with mild symptoms of COVID-19.",

Wolfel et al noted no discernible difference between nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal viral loads in hospitalized cases of COVID-19. 14 Given these high viral loads throughout the respiratory tract it may be that requiring NP sampling is not as significant for SARS-CoV-2 as for some other respiratory viruses. It may also be that PCR methods for viral detection are improving the sensitivity of a range of sample and collection methods as shown for a range of respiratory viruses but also Group A Streptococcal detection. 9, 10 We hypothesize that the high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and sensitive molecular techniques may explain the equivalent sensitivity of SC to HC samples in COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "A questionnaire assessing acceptability of SC based on that of Akmatov 4 was provided to patients. Printed instructions including diagrams were provided on how to collect throat and nasal swab (See Supplementary Information). Self-collection kits included two swab packets each containing a single swab and screw-top container with 2mL liquid Amies medium, a tongue depressor and a zip lock sample bag. SC samples were taken immediately prior to trained HC samples to reduce 'training bias.' For SC and HC at Site 1 and SC at Site 2, open-cell polyurethane foam swabs (\u03a3 Transwab \u00ae ref MW940, Medical Wire & Equipment (MWE), Wiltshire, England) were used. Throat swabs were collected from the posterior throat and tonsil areas while nasal swabs were inserted as far as comfortably possible and at least 2-3 cm inside one nostril, rotating the swab 5 times and leaving in place for 5-10 seconds. For HC at Site 2, a flocked NP swab and a foam throat swab (\u03a3 Transwab \u00ae ref MW819 and MW940) were used. In addition, because the expected SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate at the time was estimated to be less than 1%, a subset of 24 patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19 performed SC in their homes. At site 1, testing for SARS-CoV-2 was on the Allplex TM 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) and followed sample extraction using MagNA Pure 96 (Roche, Basel, USA). Samples were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive if all three gene targets (E/RdRp and N genes) were detected within 40 cycles. At site 2, the same extraction method was used. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using an in-house developed Taqman assay targeting the E gene. 17 All positive samples then underwent 3 supplementary RT-PCRs targeting the N gene. 18 Both laboratories utilised the Seegene RV Essential assay to detect other respiratory viruses (influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus and rhinovirus).",

Two parainfluenza cases and one rhinovirus case were detected only by SC. Overall the detection rate was 6% higher in SC compared with HC swabs for non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses which equated to 3/20 (15%) additional positive results. At Site 2, no co-detections occurred. Collection of samples for the 13 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients ranged from 2 to 9 days following onset of symptoms with a mean of 4\u00b78 days. One positive patient retested 6 days after symptom onset using the screening E-gene assay, was detected only on SCN but not the HC. A second positive patient was detected using HC and SCT but not SCN.

However, the additional 3 SC detections were weak positives based on high Ct values (33-40).At site 2 where comparative HC involving a NP and T swab occurred at the same time as the SCN and SCT for the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, SCNT detected all 13 positive patients while one patient was negative by HC. Detection of other respiratory viruses by SCNT was highly concordant with HC detecting only 1 less respiratory virus and may relate to the fact that SCNT sampling was compared with NP +T sampling.",
