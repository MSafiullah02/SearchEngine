This outbreak has already had a significant impact on mental health, especially in vulnerable groups such as healthcare workers (Rajkumar, 2020). Besides causing distress in their own right, these psychological symptoms have the potential to adversely impact immune functioning. Psychosocial factors such as stress, anxiety and depression are associated with increased susceptibility to viral upper respiratory infections (Pedersen et al., 2010) and can influence the immune response to the influenza vaccine (Whittaker, 2018). Such findings suggest that a link between psychological distress and immune responses to COVID-19 infection is biologically plausible and deserves further attention.",

The first, psychoneuroimmunology, is based on evidence of an intimate link between the nervous, endocrine and immune systems, and explains the mechanisms by which stress and emotional disorders can modulate the immune response to infection (Cohen and Herbert, 1996; Kim and Su, 2020). The second, the \u201cmeaning response\u201d, was developed by Moerman as an alternative to the concept of the \u201cplacebo response\u201d. According to this model, an individual\u2019s response to any given treatment depends not only on its pharmacological properties, but on the meaning they ascribe to this treatment. This meaning is largely shaped by the culture they live in (Moerman, 2003). Both these models \u2013 psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response \u2013 are valuable in understanding the effect of treatments that do not work via a conventional \u201cscientific\u201d paradigm, and are not mutually exclusive; a \u201cmeaningful\u201d intervention could modulate immune function through its effects on psychological distress.",

For some, there is already putative evidence of a cellular mechanism, at least in vitro, which could modulate psychoneuroimmune pathways in a positive way; in others, the effect can only be inferred from evidence of efficacy in alleviating psychological distress or in providing a symbolic meaning related to health, well-being and protection against specific diseases. While there is no direct evidence that the \u201cmeaning response\u201d can affect immune function, it may be associated with alterations in immune-inflammatory activity in vivo, as well as with reduced stress, anxiety and mood, mediated through effects on mesolimbic and mesocortical brain circuits (Oken, 2008).",

If they can be confirmed, such effects would be consistent with anthropological perspectives which show that there is no irreconcilable difference between Ayurvedic and \u201cbiological\u201d models of mind-body medicine (Lang, 2013), with psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response providing potential \u201cmissing links\u201d between the two. The further development of such explanatory models could clarify the usefulness of \u201ctraditional\u201d medical practices during disease outbreaks, and could facilitate a more synergistic interaction between traditional and modern medicine (Shankar and Patwardhan, 2017).",
