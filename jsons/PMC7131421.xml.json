The first event, in 2003, was the rapid spread globally of the coronavirus causing SARS [12]. Case fatality was often high and the economic and societal impact was major. SARS left behind a sensitization to the health impact of an emerging infection and the value of measures to control transmission. The SARS outbreaks were followed by the return in 2003 of the highly pathogenic avian A (H5N1) in humans, initially in South East Asia [13], [14]. The case fatality, sometimes as high as 80%, jolted the biomedical world. Since all influenza pandemics of the 20th century were of avian origin, the possibility that this virus could mutate or reassort with other influenza viruses and become easily transmissible among humans raised the specter of an influenza pandemic even more serious than 1918. These events, created a supposition that the next pandemic would be of avian origin and would be severe [15].",

In terms of prophylaxis and control of infection and disease, three pillars were identified: vaccines, antivirals and non-pharmaceutical interventions, with vaccines ideally the first line of defense [16]. Studies of the H5N1 virus vaccine demonstrated that the addition of an adjuvant allowed use of less viral antigen with improved immunogenicity which would, in turn, allow more vaccine to be made available [17], [18]. In Europe regulatory filing was undertaken of \u201cmock-up\u201d dossiers for adjuvanted vaccines, which could apply to any pandemic virus [19].

Overall, of great concern was the possibility that the world would not have vaccines or antivirals during an early period of devastating spread, resulting in social disruption. The new international health regulations (IHR) had provided guidance on handling international reporting and border closure during such a public health emergency [20]. Pandemic phases were designated to guide actions that countries should take in pandemic preparation. The first phases were designed on the assumption, based on the experience with A (H5N1) virus, that the pandemic influenza virus would gradually adapt itself to be able to transmit from human to human. Discussion of changes in the original phases had been underway for several years, in particular because of episodes of unsustained human to human transmission of H5N1, after initial transmission from poultry to humans. The new classification (Table 1\n), finally released in early 2009, made phase 4 the critical one as this was the phase which recognized that there was sustained human to human transmission of \u201can animal or human-animal influenza reassortant\u201d [1]. It was at this point when decisions to move to pandemic vaccine production would need to be made. Because of the anticipated delay of at least 6 months from the identification of the pandemic to the availability of vaccine, it was felt that the decision as to whether or not to proceed to large scale pandemic vaccine production needed to be made early before global spread had been documented [6]. Given the short incubation period for influenza and rapid doubling time, waiting until it was absolutely certain that there was a severe global pandemic would have removed prevention by vaccination as a real option to mitigate the burden.",

It is important to note that assessment of the severity of the outbreak was not part of declaring a pandemic. Although there was gradual recognition of the need to assess the severity to help countries determine what measures to adopt, it was felt that it might vary globally based on local conditions so that, by spring 2009, no specific agreed formula had been developed. In retrospect, the decision not to include severity probably made communicating the rationale for the process more difficult; however, it was always felt that the assessment of severity would be independent of the phases, which would be based on extent of spread.",

Initial reports suggested that case fatality in Mexico was relatively high; later outbreaks in the United States and Canada suggested different characteristics [3], [7]. As a result of documented spread of the new virus, on 25 April 2009, an Emergency Committee of 15 members appointed by WHO as stipulated by the IHR, followed the existing procedure guidelines and advised the WHO director-general to declare that a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d existed [22]. This involved various actions under the regulations and included intensified surveillance. WHO declared phase 4 on 27 April 2009, recognizing sustained human to human transmission of the A (H1N1) virus. By June 11, 2009, it was obvious that transmission was widespread, and phase 6 was announced [2]. By this time, many manufacturers had begun large scale vaccine production and many countries had signed contracts to obtain these vaccines for their citizens. At this point, it was realized that most illnesses were not severe, and in the communiqu\u00e9 accompanying the announcement, it was described as \u201cmoderate in severity\u201d. Many, remembering past pandemics still were concerned about a potential change in illness characteristics.",

Approaches varied, the most aggressive being in the UK with use of antivirals drug initially for prophylaxis, especially to control school outbreaks, and then for treatment; antivirals were dispensed to those with appropriate symptoms following a call to a toll-free number [23]. The value of the antivirals, particularly in treatment, is still being evaluated. In Canada, the lower impact of infections in Northern populations in the second wave compared to the first may be related to the more widespread use of antivirals during the latter period in that country [24].",

However, the bulk of vaccines available globally can be broadly divided into adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted inactivated preparations; the viral antigen might be split or subunit. As discussed above, due to the poor immunogenicity of the A (H5N1) virus, had this pandemic been caused by that virus, all vaccines would have had to be adjuvanted. However, since the swine origin\u2014A (H1N1) virus was distantly related to viruses that had circulated previously in humans, it was decided in the US and some other countries to take a calculated risk and rely on unadjuvanted vaccines. In the United States, this had an advantage from the regulatory standpoint as the vaccines would represent only a strain change, so that approval could be facilitated. However, the decision in the US to use unadjuvanted vaccines which required much higher antigen content inherently reduced the amount of vaccine antigen which would be available for non-manufacturing and developing countries [6]. Because of prior experience with adjuvanted influenza vaccines and because of the mock-up regulatory dossiers, adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines were produced for much of the world. With the adjuvant MF-59, 7.5 mcg of antigen was sufficient and with adjuvant AS-03, only 3.8 mcg per dose was needed to produce a satisfactory immunologic response; in contrast, 15 mcg per dose was required in the US vaccine. The use of adjuvanted vaccine was supported by WHO because this would result in a larger number of vaccine doses being available for the rest of the world [25].",

In fact, there was considerable media attention at that time on the occasional deaths in H1N1 infected individuals. There were also predictions that the pandemic virus would become further adapted to human to human transmission, and associated disease might become more severe, as has hypothesized to have occurred in the 1918 pandemic.

Hospitalization numbers were similar to those seen in a major seasonal outbreak, but the age distribution was different, with children and younger adults experiencing most of these events. In contrast, mortality was lower than seen in seasonal outbreaks, mainly because of the relative sparing of older individuals, who typically experience 90% of the deaths [27], [28]. However, because the deaths were mainly in younger individuals, the impact on life expectancy was particularly high; the estimate, for the US during the period May\u2013December, 2009, was that there were between 334,000 and 1,973,000 years of life lost [29].

However, there are broader issues that need to be addressed, which may not be considered in more technical reviews. One concern is that had the pandemic been more severe, the use of unadjuvanted vaccine by the US and consequence antigen \u201coveruse\u201d could have resulted in needless deaths due to lack of vaccine availability in the developing world. The lack of a pre-approval dossier system for pandemic vaccines in the US perhaps fostered this situation. Another concern is the perception in some quarters that the response to the 2009 pandemic was an overreaction that cost governments money for vaccines and antivirals at a point when, because of the global recession, resources were particularly limited. It is important that there be recognition that there was a high level of uncertainty regarding the severity and potential time course of a pandemic at the point when decisions on vaccine purchases had to be made. If the pandemic had not been as mild as the 2009 pandemic, millions of lives could have been at risk if a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach had been taken. This seems to have been understood in countries where communication between the government, the press and the public were good. In these countries the focus of discussion has been on ways to increase speed and timing of vaccine availability, real issues which can be addressed. This shows what can and must be accomplished even in a situation fraught with inherent difficulties and uncertainties.",

The new improvements in vaccine technology spurred by pandemic planning will help in seasonal control as well. In the United States, there is now a universal recommendation for influenza vaccine use [31]. Everyone 6 months of age or older is recommended to receive vaccine annually, according to current policy. From a practical standpoint, seasonal production is tightly linked to availability of vaccine for pandemics. It is currently impossible to have facilities ready to produce pandemic vaccine when they have not been producing a similar seasonal vaccine. This has been recognized in some countries but not in others.",

Yet pandemic vaccines for those areas will not be available without annual production of vaccines for seasonal control. It is impossible to produce a preparation only for events occurring several times a century, whatever the improvements in technology. Efforts at regional production of vaccine have begun, led by the WHO and other organizations which could ameliorate the unethical disparity between rich and poor countries [32]. However, sustaining these programs will only be possible if it is demonstrated that there is a significant burden of seasonal influenza in less developed regions requiring vaccine use, at least for some segments of the population. We are beginning to see evidence of this in burden studies in Bangladesh and other heavily populated, under-resourced regions [33]. The demonstrated impact to date is in young children, and not yet in the elderly, the traditional risk group in the developed world.",

We have tried to address the hard choices that must be made early in a pandemic and explore the context in which these decisions were recently made. It is often easy in retrospect to criticize decisions made during the course of an event. However, such criticism must take into account the potential harm that delay of vaccine availability in a severe pandemic can cause. In addition, it must be recognized that the only way to assure adequate global supply of influenza vaccine in a pandemic is to develop sufficient seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturing and distribution for the developing world. Thus, obtaining more information on the burden of influenza in the developing world to assess whether annual vaccination with seasonal vaccines is warranted should be a high priority to facilitate planning for the mitigation of future pandemics.",
