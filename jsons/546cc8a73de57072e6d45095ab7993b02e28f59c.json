The isolated P domain forms dimers and binds to histo-blood group antigen receptors, not requiring the formation of VLPs (Tan et al., 2004) . In addition, a binding pocket in the P domain is responsible for viral receptor binding, and formation of this pocket involves only intramolecular interactions . Prasad et al.

The RNA genome of Norwalk virus, the prototype strain for the genus Norovirus, is 7,654 nucleotides in length and is polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end (Jiang et al., 1993b) . The lack of a cap structure typical of eukaryotic mRNA and the absence of an internal ribosomal entry site suggest that the VPg protein may play a role in the initiation of protein synthesis on calicivirus RNA through unique proteinprotein interactions with the cellular translation machinery (Daughenbaugh et al., 2003) . Removal of VPg from calicivirus RNA by proteinase K digestion results in loss of infectivity and dramatically reduces translation of FCV RNA in vitro (Herbert et al., 1997) . The genome of calicivirus is organized into two or three major ORFs. The nonstructural proteins encoded in the calicivirus ORF1 were predicted on the basis of their sequence similarities with picornavirus nonstructural proteins (Neill, 1990) . Amino acid sequence motifs in common with the poliovirus 2C NTPase, 3C protease, and 3D RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were readily identified and provided templates for further characterization of the calicivirus nonstructural proteins. Proteolytic mapping and enzymatic studies of in vitro-translated polyprotein or recombinant protein expression have confirmed the presence of an NTPase (p41), a 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), an RdRp, and the location in the polyprotein of the genome-linked protein VPg (Liu et al., 1996; Dunham et al., 1998; Pfister and Wimmer, 2001) .

Viruses in the latter two genera have two major ORFs (ORF1 and ORF2). In the genus Sapovirus, the ORF1/2 junction consists of a one-or four-nucleotide overlap between the stop codon of ORF1 and the first AUG codon of ORF2. A third ORF has been described in certain strains that overlaps the capsid protein gene in a +1 frameshift, which is not found in the Norovirus genome (Liu et al., 1995; Guo et al., 1999b; Clarke and Lambden, 2000) . The presence of a conserved translation initiation motif GCAAUGG at the 5\u2032 end of this overlapping ORF suggests that a biologically active protein may be encoded in this ORF (Schuffenecker et al., 2001) . Viruses in the genera Norovirus and Vesivirus have three major ORFs (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3). In noroviruses, the first and third ORFs are in the same reading frame and Norwalk virus ORF3 encodes a 212-amino-acid minor structural protein of the virion (Glass et al., 2000a) . All calicivirus genomes begin with a 5\u2032-end terminal GU. This 5\u2032 end sequence is repeated internally in the genome and most likely corresponds to the beginning of a subgenomic-sized RNA transcript (2.2-2.4 kb) that is coterminal with the 3\u2032 end of the genome and that has been observed in FCV-and RHDV-infected cells as well as packaged into virions (Herbert et al., 1996) . A comparison of the 5\u2032-end sequences of representative viruses within each of the four genera and the corresponding repeated internal sequences suggests that this is a characteristic feature of caliciviruses. The synthesis of a subgenomic RNA in calicivirus-infected cells is a major difference between the replication strategy of caliciviruses and picornaviruses, although several of the replicative enzymes share distant homology (Green et al., 2001) . It is not clear whether caliciviruses have a picornavirus-like internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) for the initiation of translation but is considered unlikely because translation of the FCV capsid precursor protein begins at the first AUG of the subgenomic RNA (Sosnovtsev and Green, 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 640, "end": 658, "text": "(Liu et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 659, "end": 677, "text": "Guo et al., 1999b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 678, "end": 703, "text": "Clarke and Lambden, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 880, "end": 908, "text": "(Schuffenecker et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF312"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1182, "text": "(Glass et al., 2000a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1557, "text": "(Herbert et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1992, "end": 2012, "text": "(Green et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 2278, "end": 2306, "text": "(Sosnovtsev and Green, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF324"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 254, "end": 260, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Early studies demostrating the great variability of noroviruses soon led to the belief that it was important to distinguish between strains to better understand their epidemiology.

When Melksham virus was compared with Mexico virus and the Japanese strain Oth-25, no significant difference was found in sequence identities of the capsid and RNA polymerase regions and hence Snow Mountain virus was considered a recombinant virus . Caliciviruses contain subgenomic RNA that covers the entire 3\u2032 end of the genome from the capsid gene to the 3\u2032 end ( Fig. 3.1 ). It has been hypothesized that the subgenomic RNA could act as an independent unit participating in the recombination events. It remains unknown how subgenomic RNA is involved in virus replication, but it is clear that both genomic and subgenomic RNAs share highly conserved 5\u2032 end sequences and that both RNAs are assembled into virions. It is possible that interaction between genomic and subgenomic RNAs occurs by the same mechanism as that of genomic-genomic interaction, thereby significantly increasing the chance of recombination events (Jiang et al., 1999a) . If RNA recombination is a common phenomenon among caliciviruses, a high diversity might be expected in Caliciviridae, which would facilitate the emergence of new variants and make genotyping more difficult. In addition, recombination may permit caliciviruses to escape host immunity, analogous to antigenic shifts in influenza viruses, but by a different molecular mechanism.

Six structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6, VP7) and six nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6) are encoded.The coding assignments, functions, and many properties of the proteins encoded by each of the 11 genome segments are now well established (Table 3 .3). Protein assignments have been determined by in vitro translation using mRNA or denatured dsRNA and by analyses of reassortant viruses (Estes and Cohen, 1989; Estes, 2001) . Cryo-EM analysis of rotavirus has provided first visualization of the structural organization of the viral genome (Prasad et al., 1996b) .The dsRNA forms a dodecahedral structure in which the RNA double helices, interacting closely with the VP2 inner layer, are packed around the transcription complexes located at the icosahedral vertices ( Fig. 3.3D ). VP2 has RNA binding properties and may be responsible for the icosahedral ordering and for the closely interacting portions of the RNA. A study by Pesavento et al. (2001) demonstrated reversible condensation and expansion of the rotavirus genome within the capsid interior under various chemical conditions. This condensation is concentric with respect to the particle center, and a dark mass of density is consistently seen in the center of each of the particles. At high pH in the presence of ammonium ions, the genome condenses to a radius of 180 \u00c5 from the original radius of 220 \u00c5, and when brought back to physiological pH the genome expands to its original radius (Pesavento et al., 2001) . This study suggests that VP2, through its RNA-binding properties, plays an important role in maintaining appropriate spacing between the RNA strands in the native expanded state. A plausible and elegant model for the structural organization of the genome that emerges from these studies is that each dsRNA segment is spooled around a transcription enzyme complex at the fivefold axes, inside the innermost capsid layer (Prasad et al., 1996b; Pesavento et al., 2001 Pesavento et al., , 2003 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 626, "end": 649, "text": "(Estes and Cohen, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 650, "end": 662, "text": "Estes, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 779, "end": 801, "text": "(Prasad et al., 1996b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF289"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1190, "text": "Pesavento et al.

It has been shown that the primary cleavage of HAV polyprotein occurs at the 2A/2B junction, which has been mapped by the N-terminal sequencing of 2B.

Later, however, it was discovered that enteric adenoviruses could be propagated in Graham 293 cells, a cell line of human embrionic kidney (HEK) cells transformed with adenovirus 5 early (E) region 1 (Graham et al., 1977; Takiff et al., 1981) , although at lower levels than other serotypes. This suggests that E1 functions are poorly expressed in cells infected with adenovirus types 40 and 41, and therefore it was postulated that the inability of these serotypes to grow in cell lines normally supportive for other adenovirus types was due to the relative inability of the adenovirus 41 E1A gene to transactivate other adenovirus 41 genes (Takiff et al., 1984; van Loon et al., 1985a) .

However, many questions still remain to be answered.The development of efficient reverse genetics systems would be extremely useful in the analysis of the mechanisms of viral replication and of gene expression of the different enteric viruses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SUMMARY"}, {"text": "Biochemical characterization of viral interactions with cells and analysis of the functional properties of the viral proteins are providing a better understanding of the pathogenesis of enteric viruses. Rotavirus NSP4 is the first viral enterotoxin to be characterized. Several cell membrane molecules have been identified recently as being receptors for different enteric viruses (i.e., integrins and hsc70 for rotaviruses, ABH histo-blood group carbohydrates for noroviruses). Studies on human susceptibility to norovirus infections have characterized some resistant nonsecretor (Se-) individuals in the population, which is a breakthrough in our knowledge of norovirus-host interactions.
