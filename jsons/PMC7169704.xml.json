Recently, a new genus, Deltacoronavirus, was first discovered in birds from Hong Kong and identified in various host species, including Asian leopard cats, and some avian species (Dong et al., 2007; Woo et al., 2009; Chan et al., 2013). Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first documented as a novel coronavirus in pigs from rectal swabs in Hong Kong 2012 (Woo et al., 2012), and then recognized and isolated in USA (Li et al., 2014; Marthaler et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2014a,b; Hu et al., 2015) and Korea (Lee and Lee, 2014). Clinical reports indicated that PDCoV could cause severe diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration in piglets, symptomatically indistinguishable from those caused by porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Wang et al., 2014a). Experimental studies on conventional and gnotobiotic piglets showed that isolated PDCoVs caused similar clinical symptoms to those of field infections, from mild to severe diarrhoea and intestinal lesions (Chen et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015). Molecular surveillance on diarrhoeal samples of pigs from USA indicated a 30% infection of PDCoV, which was considered as a common viral pathogen of pigs. Coinfection of PDCoV/porcine rotavirus (PoRV) was most common in pig herds in USA (Marthaler et al., 2014b).",

The clinical manifestations of the disease were characterized with profuse watery diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration and a high mortality (>80%) in suckling piglets, resembling the diseases caused by PEDV and/or TGEV. Intestinal/faecal samples (n = 31) from diseased pigs were submitted to our laboratory for identification of aetiologic agent(s). Initially, common enteric viral and bacterial pathogens, including PEDV, TGEV, PoRV and Escherichia coli, were examined with standard assays. The results indicated that only 10 of 31 (32.25%) samples tested were positive for PEDV, but negative for the rest enteric pathogens aforementioned. Due to the features of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED)\u2010like of the disease, we hypothesized that PDCoV might be a contributor for the diarrhoea outbreak in pigs and attempted to identify and characterize the potential PDCoV.",

Further study is needed to elucidate the interactions between these two viruses. The PDCoV infection rate (33.71%) from the survey in Jiangxi, China, was consistent with the previous report (Marthaler et al., 2014a,b).
