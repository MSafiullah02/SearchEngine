The state of respiratory mucosa also correlates with age (Beule, 2010) . Correlation of Covid-19 mortality with low air humidity is less obvious. By way of anecdotal evidence, in addition to the coincidence of the beginning of the epidemic with the dry season in Wuhan mentioned above, note that Seoul and especially Tokyo, where the incidence and mortality have been lower, have on average wetter climate (Wiki-Seoul, 2020; Wiki-Tokyo, 2020) . Correlate of sharp raise in Covid-19 mortality with local dry period may also be seen on the example of Lombardy, where February is the driest month in Milan (Wiki-Milan, 2020), as opposed to a wetter beginning of the spring in Rome (Wiki-Rome, 2020). The much dryer March in Spain as opposed to e.g. more humid neighbouring Portugal (Wiki-Lisbon, 2020) seem to point in the same direction of raise in Covid-19 mortality correlate with transient over-dry local environment.",

FIG.1 shows the Covid-19 mortality rate in the federal states vs the average local air humidity in March. The local air humidity was defined as proxy recorded in the largest city of each federal state (Weather and Climate, 2020) . The choice of the German federal states data sets is motivated by the data availability and reliability, and, in particular, by the presumed uniformity of the data collection protocols in Germany. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has been excluded as the resource (Weather and Climate, 2020) gives no humidity data neither for Rostock nor for Schwerin. The linear least squares fit (red solid line), weighted by the most recent population size of the federal states as given by Wikipedia, gives the slope of 8.09 \uf02d with a standard deviation of 3.32 \uf0b1 , i.e. reliably negative. We have also applied the Theil-Sen estimator, also weighing the data points proportionally to population sizes, which gives the slope of 3.10 \uf02d . are looking at only one of the factors. Still, the two estimates concur that the slope of the dependence is negative, that is mortality is on average higher in a drier air and lowers with rise of air humidity, which confirms our hypothesis on negative correlate of Covid-19 mortality with local air humidity.",

Therefore, it might be useful to distinguish between the spread of Covid-19 infection and the asynchronous local rises of Covid-19 mortality. For instance, a prolonged dry weather may be taken as an indication of likely local elevation of Covid-19 mortality. In Madrid, August is the forestall or flatten the second wave of Covid-19 there. On a general point, it might take at least an annual cycle of the global data to fully appreciate the spatiotemporal pattern of Covid-19 pandemic, and build the data based model.In presence of Covid-19 virus, patients with tendency to dry respiratory mucosa might be particularly vulnerable to the exposure to dry air. Indoor environment might become over-dry due to the winter central heating, domestic devices producing heat, especially if the only source of the indoor humidity are people themselves which might be not enough. It might be not possible to alter local microclimate, not to mention an instant change of the global one. However, control of indoor J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f environment is feasible and might mitigate patients' exposure to Covid-19. Balance of exposure to Covid-19 virus in dry air against the well known exposure to bacterial infection in a humid environment must be taken into account when developing a healthy indoor technology. To the author's knowledge, this aspect has not yet been discussed, while, if true, this could immediately start saving lives, which is the reason for this publication.",
