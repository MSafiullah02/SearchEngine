ACE is an ectoenzyme that plays a role in the generation of Ang II by catalysing the extracellular conversion of the decapeptide Ang I.4 In the past two decades, a new homologue of the enzyme, termed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was identified, and ACE2 can convert Ang II to Ang(1-7) or convert Ang I to Ang(1-9).5,6 Although Ang II increases blood pressure (BP), Ang(1-7) is a vasodilator, and the ACE2/Ang(1-7) axis has been suggested to act as a natural damping mechanism for the activation of the classical RAS.7",

Coronaviruses are members of the subfamily Coronavirinae, in the Coronaviridae family and the Nidovirales order, including four genera\u2014Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus.21 Coronaviruses cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans. They were not considered to be highly pathogenic to humans until the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Six human-infecting types of coronaviruses were discovered before 2019. Two highly pathogenic viruses [SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)] cause severe respiratory syndromes in humans, and the other four human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HKU1) induce only mild upper respiratory tract diseases in immunocompetent hosts.15,22,23 In 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in China and all over the world. It has infected >1 300 000 of the population and became a public health emergency declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). So far, the pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia is still not clear. Human influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family. Based on the matrix and nucleoprotein genes, influenza viruses have been classified as type A, B, C, and D. In humans, only influenza A and B viruses (influenza A and B) are of epidemiological and public interest,24 although other related viruses (influenza C and D viruses) may also cause at least subclinical infections in humans.15 Despite the production of annually designed vaccines and the many improvements in public health surveillance and infrastructure, each year, in the USA alone, seasonal influenza A and B viruses continue to evolve and take the lives of 3000\u201348 000 people.25 Highly transmissible and pathogenic virus outbreaks cause a significant disease burden in terms of morbidity and associated complications, and have a huge economic impact.11,26,27 Meanwhile, CV disease is also the leading cause of death and disease burden worldwide.15",

Furthermore, antibodies directed against ACE2 and soluble ACE2 molecules and derivatives were demonstrated to be capable of blocking SARS-CoV infection.55 Like SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 also employs ACE2 as a receptor for cellular entry.56 Wevers and Hoek found that HCoV-NL63 infection induced a reduction of cellular ACE2 expression.57 Tseng et al. demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing hACE2 were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, resulting in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, including death, depending upon the transgenic lineages.58 Letko and Munster first demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 used the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV,10 and subsequent studies also confirmed this result.15,59\u201361",

The effect of ACE inhibitor (ACEI) treatment during coronaviruses/influenza virus infections in humans is unclear.

In recent decades, numerous advances have been made in the development of vaccines against influenza viruses, such as the replacement of inactivated whole-virus vaccines with split or subunit vaccines, which comprise less reactogenic alternatives.74 The majority of available annual trivalent influenza vaccines contain two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and only one influenza B virus.75 More recently, inactivated quadrivalent vaccines containing both Victoria and Yamagata lineages of type B IV have become available.76,77 Several epidemiological and clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of the influenza vaccine in patients with CV disease.35,78,79 In a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, Udell et al. reported that the use of the influenza vaccine was associated with a lower risk of major adverse CV events.80 In another meta-analysis including eight trials with 12 029 participants, Clar et al. reported that influenza vaccination may reduce CV mortality and combined CV events in patients with CV disease.81 Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis including six cohort studies and 179 158 participants also confirmed that influenza vaccination was associated with a significant decrease in all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure.82",

We therefore hypothesize that the risk of coronavirus or influenza virus infection is high among the CV disease-susceptible population, at least partly due to high ACE2 expression in this population, which needs to be confirmed in the future. Our hypotheses suggest that more protection should be employed for patients with CV disease. Coronavirus or influenza virus vaccine usage in the high CV risk population could be a potential strategy to prevent both CV disease and coronavirus/influenza virus infections. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine for coronavirus prevention and control, and it will be important to evaluate the effect of coronavirus vaccines on CV protection.",
