We propose a multi-agent system to simulate the interactions between actors working together to organize an optimal response to epidemic detection.

The approach will be based on the current DRC heath system processes to extract relevant actors\u2019 tasks. The identification of these actors and their tasks will provide the opportunity to simulate a new system that distributes the entire competences of the old heath system to those actors in order to improve their collaboration and eventually shorten the making-decision time response. Work-sharing protocols will be proposed to simplify the complexity of the data sources.",

As information must pass through intermediate level (Provincial Health Division), with defective means of communications, it drastically hampers the fight against a propagation of a disease. Since decision-making is pushed back to the central level, it can intervene belatedly at the risk of witnessing an alarming spread of an epidemic with high epidemic potential.",

A reactive agent reacts to the stimuli of the environment. Cognitive agents have a more developed intelligence: they manage knowledge and make decisions according to their internal states and according to their perception of the environment. It is provided with autonomous behaviors and some objectives. Autonomy is the main concept in the agent issue: it is the ability of agents to control their actions and their internal states. The agents\u2019 autonomy implies no centralized control [14]. When a MAS integrates agents on the fly dynamically during the execution, the system is qualified as an opened one. Otherwise, it is a closed one. One of the advantages of MAS is to model systems where a global description is not possible at any given moment. Multi-agent conception is well suitable to model actors described in Fig. 1.",

First case, MAS approaches are suitable to applications where a complete control is unreachable, the high number of entities or the complexity of entities\u2019 behavior make hard to represent the overall system. The second case is related to the monitoring of the epidemics. In a general way, the model of each agents going into action in the system is designed in microscopic level. The environment, the agents\u2019 interactions and the social organizations are defined at the macroscopic level. In MAS domain, there are numerous methods to approach the analysis and the design of the software application. The methods come from various domains such as object oriented design, knowledge engineering or reproduction of behavior or natural phenomena. The first methods were AAII [15] which uses an external view (roles services, organization) and internal view (agent design bases on Belief Desire Intention architecture). Cassiop\u00e9e [15] is a bottom-up approach based on natural behavior and DESIRE [16] is based on knowledge engineering. The method Vowels [17] allows obtaining modularity at the level of the multi-agents models by decomposing the problem into four elementary facets. Other method like Gaia [18] extends the concepts used in classical object engineering and provides a microscopic and a macroscopic view of the software system. There are also complete approaches for developing multi-agents systems from the analysis to the deployment by using MaSE [19] or Prometheus [20]. Moreover some models al-low the designer to develop the agent like AGR [19] based on Agent/Group/Role or BDI [21] based on Belief/Desir/Intention.",

As they are autonomous they perform their own tasks like \u201ccumulate new cases\u201d, \u201cconduct the investigation on Health Zone # 16\u201d and manage messages like \u201crealize analyzes from Health Center\u201d, \u201creceive sample to_ analyze\u201d or \u201creport suspicious case detected\u201d. HZET Agents (#16 and #13) are waiting for a suspicious case message from any HC. Whenever Health Zone Executive Team Agent receives such a message he computes cases and compare with the threshold of disease monitoring to decide the necessity of building a RRT Agent able to investigate in Health Centers around suspicious case in Health Area. The visited health center will turn from green to blue color. RRT Agent could send samples to LaboAgent while searching for new cases in Health Areas. The organization of outbreak riposte could depend on the results from LaboAgent and investigation report from RRT Agent.\n",
