            "text": "This study was a prospective investigation of neonates with ALRI. From January 2009 to May 2010, neonates (<1 month of age) admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Gachon University Gil Hospital due to ALRI were enrolled. ALRI were defined as equivalent to clinical pneumonia or acute bronchiolitis, which is characterized by acute\u2010onset cough or difficulty breathing with increased respiratory rate (respiration rate \u226560 breaths/min). All neonates were isolated in a separate room in the NICU. After obtaining informed consent, nasal swab samples were obtained from neonates with ALRI within 1 h of hospitalization. Neonates with bacterial isolation from blood samples, or underlying medical conditions, such as premature birth (<35 weeks of gestational age), congenital heart disease, and CLD were excluded from this study. During the study period, one nurse, who was unaware of the present study, recorded the following variables: history of premature birth, the presence of underlying medical conditions, breastfeeding, number of siblings, siblings attending day\u2010care centers, number of residents at home, exposure to smoke, and residence in a neonatal day\u2010care center in the previous 48 h. In South Korea, neonatal day\u2010care centers are common places that provide caregivers for mothers and neonates after discharge from delivery hospitals. In these facilities, assistants take care of many neonates in a room, similar to a nursery. Respiratory infections were considered to be acquired at a neonatal day\u2010care center if the neonates became symptomatic within 48 h of discharge from such a center. The clinical features and clinical courses during the hospitalization were summarized by one of the attending physicians who were blinded to this study. Clinical variables, such as rhinorrhea and/or cough, fever (defined as axillary temperature \u226538\u00b0C), and requirement for oxygen therapy, were recorded. Apnea was defined as a lack of breathing activity for at least 20 s. Dyspnea referred to tachypnea (respiration rate \u226560 breaths/min) combined with the presence of pronounced chest wall retractions. Pneumonia was documented only if the clinical diagnosis was confirmed on chest radiography. On admission, a blood sample was taken to measure total white blood cell count and C\u2010reactive protein, and for blood cultures. Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm3.",

RT was performed using the Revert Aid TM First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada). PCR amplification was performed using 10 \u03bcL of Seeplex RV Master Mix 12 (Seegen, Seoul, South Korea), 4 \u03bcL of 5X multiplex primer sets, 3 \u03bcL of 8\u2010methoxypsoralen solution, and 3 \u03bcL of newly synthesized first\u2010strand cDNA. Seeplex RV contained A and B sets of primers designed from highly conserved regions of genetic sequences for 12 respiratory viruses, including human coronavirus (hCoV)\u2010229E/NL63, hCoV\u2010OC43, hMPV, hRV, RSV A/B, influenza A/B, hPIV\u20101, 2, 3, and adenovirus. An initial pre\u2010PCR step of 94\u00b0C for 15 min was performed followed by a total of 40 PCR cycles under the following conditions: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 1.5 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min. The final cycle was followed by an extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min to complete any partial polymerization. The amplified PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The type of respiratory virus was identified by comparison with the reference band size provided by the manufacturer.",
