            "text": "CD4+CD56+ hematopoietic malignancies are now regarded as a distinct clinicopathologic entity. CD4, a glycoprotein expressed on helper T cells and a subset of monocytes and thymocytes, has been found in T cell leukemia/lymphoma and in acute myeloid leukemia. Among leukocytes, the neural cell adhesion molecule CD56 is expressed predominantly on natural killer (NK) cells and on a small subset of T cells (CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor cells and a subgroup of \u03c7\u03b4-T-cells). Its expression on leukemia and lymphoma cells characterizes a heterogeneous group of malignancies. Coexpression of both antigens is very rare. The classification of CD4+CD56+ lymphomas leads to a somewhat confusing terminology for this entity: blastic/blastoid NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia, cutaneous monomorphous CD4+ CD56+large cell lymphoma, agranular NK-cell lymphoma, etc. In the new WHO classification, CD4+CD56+neoplasms are probably included in the ill-defined category of blastic NK-cell lymphomas. CD4+CD56+malignancies must be distinguished from the nasal type of extranodal NK/T cell lymphomas and aggressive NK-cell leukemias that may be closely related entities occurring frequently in the Asian population (Table 1). While nasal-type NK/T cell lymphoma is characterized by preferential involvement of the nasopharynx with angiocentric and angioinvasive growth resulting in extensive coagulative necroses, aggressive NK-cell leukemia usually presents with constitutional symptoms, and leukemic course. Both tumors show CD2+CD3-CD56+ phenotype and are almost constantly associated with EBV. In contrast to CD4+CD56+ lymphoma, they often present in middle-aged females.1,2,3,4",

Some authors proposed precursor NK-cell origin, whereas others suggested that CD4+CD56+ tumor cells derived from myelo-monocytic precursor cells. Petrella et al5 performed extensive flow cytometric analysis in 14 cases and found very high levels of CD123 expression suggesting that this disease derives from plasmacytoid monocytes. Furthermore, some authors have described reactive CD4+CD56+ cells within kidney allografts during tubular necrosis and rejection6 and within liver biopsies in patients with chronic active hepatitis B.7 They hypothesized that prolonged antigen stimulation may produce this unusual phenotype. Recently, Chaperot et al8 using flow cytometry and in vitro assays suggested that CD4+CD56+ malignancies arise from transformed cells of the lymphoid-related plasmacytoid dendritic cell subset.",

            "text": "Since there is no consensus for optimal treatment in CD4+CD56+ neoplasms, therapeutic approaches for CD4+CD56+ malignancy vary widely from irradiation in localized stages to myeloablative therapy. Although the initial response rate to treatment is high with almost 70% complete remissions (CR) and 10% partial remissions (PR), only about 20% of patients show a sustained remission at the last follow-up (median observation 16 months). Most patients relapse and subsequently die of progressive disease. Patients with disease limited to the skin only show a slightly better median overall survival than patients with advanced disease (17 and 12 months, respectively), but the difference is not significant (log-rank test, data not shown). In general, outcome is poor with a median overall survival of 13 months reflecting the aggressive course of the disease (Figure 1). To investigate the impact of different therapies on outcome, treatment of published cases can be separated into four groups according to the intensity of the chemotherapy. Local therapy or systemic therapy \u2018less than CHOP\u2019: Primarily older patients are treated with local therapy or systemic therapy \u2018less than CHOP\u2019. The median age in this group is 79 years. Chemotherapy regimens were heterogeneous, but mostly cyclophosphamide-based. Some patients only received local radiation (n=5), steroid therapy (n=1), or supportive care (n=1). Despite an overall high response rate of almost 80% (68% CR, 11% PR), this group showed a very poor outcome. Only two authors reported sustained CR (7%) after this therapy; one young patient with skin-restricted disease had radiotherapy; another, a 72-year-old man with widespread disease, was treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, vincristine and intrathecal prophylaxis.24,31 However, the observation time for the two patients was only 14 and 18 months, respectively. The median overall survival for all evaluable patients is only 9 months and Kaplan\u2013Meier curves do not suggest curative potential for this therapeutic approach (Figure 2). Table 4 summarizes the clinical data for this treatment group (group A).CHOP and CHOP-like regimens: CHOP/CHOP-like chemotherapy was used most frequently in CD4+CD56+ malignancies (group B). However, compared to less aggressive therapies (group A) this moderately intensive treatment did not result in better response rates or survival benefit. The overall response rate in almost 40 evaluable patients was about 70% (55% CR), but sustained CR was only observed in one patient within this treatment group (Table 5) with a short follow-up of only 4 months.39 Taken together, CHOP (-like) therapy, like less aggressive treatments, did not seem to provide curative potential.Intensive acute leukemia protocols: Since CD4+CD56+ neoplasms usually show an aggressive course with frequent bone marrow involvement, intensive treatment according to acute leukemia seems an appropriate therapeutic approach (group C). Different protocols were investigated with a high CR rate of 94%. Sustained CR can be achieved with these regimens in about one-third of patients. Although median observation time for these responders was only 7.5 months, Falc\u00e3o et al29 reported a young boy continuing in CR for seven years following therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Table 6 shows the data for this treatment group.Myeloablative therapy: Experience with myeloablative therapy in CD4+CD56+ malignancy is limited to 10 patients (four autologous and six allogeneic transplants) that are summarized in Table 7. All patients in whom data on myeloablative therapy were evaluable underwent total body irradiation and all but one received high-dose cyclophosphamide (alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents). The entire group (group D) had a median survival of 31.5 months. However, only two of the six patients receiving allogeneic transplant relapsed (median overall survival 38.5 months) compared to three relapses in the four patients with autologous transplant (median survival 16.5 months). Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) with one exception did not lead to long-lasting disease-free survival. However, in the allogeneic setting, all but one patient remained disease-free, if the transplantation has been performed in first remission. However, this treatment is restricted to younger patients as reflected by the median age of 28.5 years in this group.",

Figure 2 shows Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves for the different treatment groups. The overall survival between groups C and D was significantly higher than in groups A and B. Group D alone was also significantly superior to groups A, B, and C. However, age \u2a7e60 years was a negative prognostic factor in CD4+CD56+ neoplasms that strongly influences outcome (Figure 3) and median age decreased when more intensified therapy was provided: 79 years (group A), 67.5 years (group B), 52 years (group C), and 28.5 years (group D), respectively. Elderly patients survived for a median of 9 months (range 2\u201340 months) compared to younger patients with a significantly longer median survival of 18 months (range 2\u201384 months; P<0.0001). Older age in less aggressive treatment groups might at least partly explain poor outcome. Therefore, we performed an age-adjusted evaluation that revealed significant superiority in the overall survival only for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in the first remission (Figure 4).",

In an age-adjusted evaluation only allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first CR showed significant superiority in terms of the overall survival compared to all other treatments in patients <60 years. Since allogeneic stem cell therapy is limited to younger patients and most patients with CD4+CD56+ malignancy are in their seventh decade of life, the vast majority of patients are not eligible for this otherwise promising therapeutic option.",
