Common\npresenting symptoms\nreported by patients with COVID-19 are high-grade fever, cough, dyspnea,\nand chest pain.1 Difficulty breathing and\nfever are obvious and troubling symptoms for any patient. Comparatively,\nthe loss of smell and taste in patients with COVID-19 may seem insignificant.\nThe published reports1,2 that first emerged from hospitals\nin Wuhan, China described several clinical features in patients severely\naffected by COVID-19. Neurologic symptoms such as acute cerebrovascular\ndiseases, impaired consciousness, and skeletal muscle injury2 implore us to consider the central nervous system\n(CNS) as a target of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of smell and taste could\nbe a manifestation of the involvement of the nervous system and does\noccur in a diverse list of other viral infections. Reports of anosmia\nand taste-related changes should be taken as an indication of SARS-CoV-2\ninfection and a heralding sign for COVID-19. In the weeks after the\nabove paper was published in ACS Chemical Neuroscience,3 the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head\nand Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) released a statement noting that anosmia\nand dysgeusia are \u201csignificant symptoms\u201d associated\nwith COVID-19.4",

The first reported case of COVID-19-associated\nacute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy was reported in a female\nwith a 3 day history of cough, fever, and altered mental status. This\npatient was diagnosed with COVID-19 by RTq-PCR performed on a specimen\nof the nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Brain MRI demonstrated\nhemorrhagic rim enhancing lesions within the bilateral thalami, medial\ntemporal lobes, and subinsular regions that were consistent with acute\nnecrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy.5 Cases of Guillain\u2212Barr\u00e9 Syndrome have also been reported\nin patients with COVID-19. Regardless of how SARS-CoV-2 gains entry\ninto the CNS, recently published data has reinforced our rationale\nof SARS-CoV-2 targeting endothelial ACE2 receptors, including documentation\nof vasculitis in patients with COVID-193,8 and findings\nobserved in the brain MRI of an affected patient.5 Although SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the specimen of a\nnasopharyngeal swab, isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from the cerebrospinal\nfluid (CSF) would be more convincing for neurotropism when coupled\nwith the MRI changes described above.5 The\nlatter study details that although CSF was obtained, a CSF analysis\nfor SARS-CoV-2 was not possible because of a traumatic lumbar puncture.5 A parallel study reported on a 56-year-old patient\ndiagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Ditan Hospital. The patient was\ndiagnosed with COVID-19-associated encephalitis, and the patient\u2019s\ngene sequencing confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF.6 These two cases add to the existing data on potential\nneurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2 and serve to better prepare healthcare\nprofessionals in identifying, diagnosing, and treating patients presenting\nwith neurologic deficits in COVID-19.",
