In the Lin et al study all of the cases had acute onset [20]. Their findings revealed abnormal X-ray and CT findings in all patients. In the early stage, the right lung was more commonly affected (particularly in the right upper and middle lobes). The lesions rapidly expanded to include the entire lungs and were characterized primarily by ground-glass opacities (GGOs) combined with consolidation. Diffuse GGO was observed in all six cases (1 was symmetric, and 5 were non-symmetric). Local consolidation was found in four cases, and lobar consolidation was found in two cases. Normal lung tissue was observed between the lesions. Pleural thickening was common and was combined with pleural/pericardial effusion or mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Reticular changes, centrilobular nodules, and the tree-in-bud sign were observed in some cases, but reticular changes, bronchial wall thickening, and hyperinflation were not found.",
