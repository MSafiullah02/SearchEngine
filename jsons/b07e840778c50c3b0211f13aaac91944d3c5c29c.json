In high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-burden settings, HIV-infected children carry a high burden of lower respiratory tract infection from common respiratory viruses, bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, Pneumocystis jirovecii and cytomegalovirus are important opportunistic pathogens. As the vertical transmission risk of HIV decreases and access to antiretroviral therapy increases, the epidemiology of these infections is changing, but HIV-infected infants and children still carry a disproportionate burden of these infections. There is also increasing recognition of the impact of in utero exposure to HIV on the general health of exposed but uninfected infants. The reasons for this increased risk are not limited to socioeconomic status or adverse environmental conditions-there is emerging evidence that these HIV-exposed but uninfected infants may have particular immune deficits that could increase their vulnerability to respiratory pathogens. We discuss the impact of tuberculosis and other lower respiratory tract infections on the health of HIV-infected infants and children.",

With this strategy, transmission should be less than 1% in women who either know their status, or are diagnosed early in pregnancy and are retained in care on an effective regimen [1, 2] . However, as vertical HIV transmission risk decreases there is increasing recognition of adverse health impacts suffered by HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) infants, including vulnerability to developing lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and tuberculosis (TB) due to socioeconomic status and adverse environmental conditions such as maternal ill health and lack of breastfeeding [3] . In these infants there is also increasing recognition of immune dysfunction including immune activation, altered T-cell numbers and function, and possibly humoral immunity [3] .",

In 2013, it was estimated that globally there were 240,000 new pediatric HIV infections [4] . In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, perinatally infected infants and children have high morbidity and mortality, with 50% dying by the age of 2 years in low resource settings [5] . Despite the high early mortality without ART, many perinatally infected children have slowly progressive disease and some may only be diagnosed in late childhood or adolescence [6] . As established by clinical, epidemiological and postmortem studies, LRTIs are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected children. LRTIs in HIV-infected children are from common childhood respiratory pathogens (viral and bacterial), as well as opportunistic pathogens, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

In addition, all of the countries with a TB incidence of more than 500 cases per 100,000 population are in sub-Saharan Africa, although large case numbers are also found in Asian countries with high population numbers [12] . In settings with a high burden of both TB and HIV, high rates of co-infection are reported and up to 56% of children treated for TB in sub-Saharan Africa are considered to be HIV-infected [8] . Studies of HIV cohorts confirm high rates of incident and prevalent TB. In Cape Town, South Africa, TB program data suggested a TB incidence of 1596 cases per 100,000 among HIV-infected infants prior to the implementation of universal ART [14] , while clinical cohort data identified 53 cases per 100 patient-years in children not on ART [15] . A randomizedcontrolled trial to assess the effect of universal isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in HIV-infected children found a TB disease rate of 121 per 1000 patient-years in children who had early ART access [16] .",

This is highlighted by cohort reports from multiple settings; in the United Kingdom, 8 of 18 TB/HIV co-infected children presented with TB, which prompted their HIV diagnosis [17] . Studies of older children and adolescents in Zimbabwe found a high yield of new HIV diagnosis in adolescents presenting with TB [18] . Rates of TB are not only increased in HIV-infected infants, but evidence suggests that HEU infants are also at increased risk for TB.

In a study of IPT in high TB burden settings, 10% of HIV-exposed infants had contact with potential source cases by the age of 14 weeks [23] . If TB in HIV-infected pregnant women is missed, the infants are not only at risk of TB, but have a 3-fold higher HIV acquisition rate [24] .

When ART is initiated in older children, reductions in presumed and confirmed incident TB of 32-70% are documented [8] . Nevertheless, HIV-infected children have more TB than their uninfected peers, including in low-burden settings [8, 30] . A transient increase in risk can also be expected in the first 3 months of therapy as part of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [31, 32] .",

Access to ART with broad penetration into the community will impact the epidemiology of TB, because there will be a decrease in adult cases of pulmonary disease. This is already clear from the decline in adult and pediatric TB cases in South Africa as the adult ART uptake increased.

In HIV-infected children there are no studies assessing post-exposure prevention; however, in a cohort of 494 children beginning ART when younger than 24 months of age in Cape Town, 127 courses of postexposure IPT were provided, with only two children developing confirmed TB. Both had fully drug-susceptible isolates [28] . In a prospective study of prevention in older HIV-infected children, many with a history of prior TB infection, both all-cause mortality (16% in the placebo arm vs. 8% in the IPT arm) and incident cases of TB (9.9% vs. 3.8%) declined [37] . A subsequent reanalysis assessing the role of IPT and ART in these children found that the greatest reduction was in children receiving both ART and IPT [38] . In contrast, a pre-exposure prevention study enrolling very young infants found high rates of TB in HIV-infected and HEU infants, but no differences between those receiving IPT and placebo [16] . In this study, drug resistance was found to play an important role in IPT failure [39] . When present, children typically have primary rather than secondarily acquired multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. HIV infection was independently associated with prevalent TB disease among child household contacts of adult MDR-TB cases and with failure of MDR preventative therapy [40] . In South African children with MDR-TB, HIV infection was reported in 54, 77, and 22% of cases from Johannesburg, Kwa-Zulu Natal, and Cape Town, respectively [41] [42] [43] . Reviewing the susceptibility/resistance patterns of adult contacts with TB is an essential component of managing children with HIV, irrespective of whether or not they have TB at the time. In children with MDR-TB, HIV is associated with a poorer outcome [44, 45] .",

There are, however, ongoing concerns over nevirapine dosing and recommendations on dose adjustments have been suggested [57] . Table 1 summarizes important considerations when treating TB/HIV co-infection [58] [59] [60] [61] . In co-treated children, efavirenz has not been associated with worse outcomes, but despite reassuring data on the pharmacokinetic outcomes of lopinavir-ritonavir 1:1 concurrent TB therapy may be a risk factor for failure in children on lopinavir-ritonavir treatment [62] [63] [64] . The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends a non-suppressive regimen of zidovidine, lamivudine and abacavir in children needing rifampicin as a short-term measure to avoid drug interactions [65] . This is based on the ARROW study. In ARROW, three nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) were studied as an intensive induction and maintenance strategy when combined with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Fifty-nine of the 1143 children required a drug alteration for TB that included stopping or replacing the NNRTI nevirapine. In contrast, children taking efavirenz did not require a drug switch. Triple NRTI for HIV suppression was effective at 36 weeks, but not at 144 weeks. The advantage of this latter strategy is that, although viral suppression is inferior, the risk of progressive NNRTI and protease inhibitor (PI) ART resistance was avoided and drug-drug interactions and logistic complications were minimized [66] . There is no current guidance on using integrase inhibitors and other PIs such as darunavir in children, and no data on newer anti-TB agents such as bedaquiline and delamanid in HIV-infected children. Nevertheless, ART should be initiated 2-8 weeks after starting TB therapy so as to reduce the risk of IRIS occurring [61] . For example, in TB meningitis cases deterioration due to paradoxical IRIS can be devastating and ART should be delayed at least 4 weeks [67, 68] . In Table 2 we highlight key messages to consider in TB and HIV co-infected children. TB may be an important challenge and opportunity in achieving the UNAID 90-90-90 targets [69] .",

Globally, there are approximately 12-14 million hospitalizations and 0.68-0.92 million deaths annually from pneumonia in children [70] [71] [72] . HIV-infected children are at increased risk of pneumonia that requires hospital admission and death from this infection. In a meta-analysis and modelling study, Theodoratou and colleagues [7] calculated that in 2010 there were 0.6-3.3 million pneumonia episodes and 47,400-153,000 pneumonia deaths in HIV-infected children living in low-resource settings. Of these cases, 1.3 million (90%) pneumonia episodes and 93% of the deaths occurred in children younger than 5 years of age from the Africa region. HIV-infected children had a 6.5 (95% CI 5.9-7.2) increase in odds of pneumonia that required hospitalization and they had an increased risk of death (odds ratio 5.9, 95% CI 2.7-12.7) [7] . The authors showed that there is also a wide variation between countries; for example, in Zimbabwe 55% of all pneumonia deaths are attributed to HIV, compared to 1% in India [7] . Even with early access to ART, pneumonia remains common among HIV-infected infants and children. In the CHER study, pneumonia occurred at a rate of 12.2 infections/100 person-years in children accessing ART before 12 weeks of age and 26.5 infections/100 person-years in children accessing ART only after laboratory evidence of immune suppression and/or clinical features of HIV infection became apparent [29] . Poor general health and malnutrition, immune depletion, chronic lung disease, increasing household exposure and vaccine responsiveness may all contribute to the risk of LRTI. A wide range of pathogens causing LRTIs and pneumonia in children with HIV is reported [73] . The importance of polymicrobial infections-including combinations of bacterial, viral, P. jirovecii and mycobacterial infections-is well recognized. Mortality is increased significantly with increasing numbers of pathogens. Children with polymicrobial pneumonia have a 10-fold greater risk of dying than children in whom only a single organism is identified [74] . ",

HIV-infected children with pneumonia are more likely to have severe disease (including bacteremia), more complications, higher rates of treatment failure and death, and possibly more antimicrobial resistance than HIVuninfected children [74] . The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia remains Streptococcus pneumoniae, but Staphylococcus aureus is increasingly important. Amongst Gram-negative bacteria associated with pneumonia in HIV-infected children, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and non-typhoidal Salmonella species are also important [73] . HIV does not affect the radiographic appearance of bacterial pneumonia. The two classic patterns of either diffuse patchy air-space disease of bronchopneumonia, or confluent air-space disease with air bronchograms of lobar or segmental pneumonia can be found [75] . Necrotizing pneumonia, a severe complication of community-acquired pneumonia in non-HIV infected children, is characterized by liquefaction and cavitation of lung tissue and is being seen increasingly [76, 77] . The most common cause is S. pneumoniae, and although in the authors' experience it also occurs in HIV-infected children, this has not been reported to date in the literature. The chest radiographs in necrotizing pneumonia frequently demonstrate both pleural and parenchymal involvement. The so-called 'atypical pneumonias' can present with a variable radiographic appearance, which includes reticulonodular infiltration, patchy or confluent air-space disease or a combination of all three patterns [78] . It is, therefore, very important to correlate the radiographic appearance with the clinical setting [78] .",

The isolation of CMV by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from various sites or specimens does not prove that the child has CMV pneumonia. The chest radiographic appearance of PJP and CMV pneumonia can be very similar (diffuse alveolar disease). In children being ventilated for PJP and not responding to treatment for PJP, CMV was histologically proven in 72% of cases and associated with a poor outcome [97, 98] . CMV viremia is common in all infants with pneumonia, and a viral logarithmic load (to the base 10) of 4.6 or more was predictive of pneumonia in a study of from Cape Town [99] . In HIV-infected infants with severe pneumonia from suspected PJP, we would suggest that empiric treatment for CMV infection with either ganciclovir or valgancyclovir be used wherever possible, until such time that CMV infection can be excluded.",

Real-time PCR is better than immunofluorescence at making a microbiologic diagnosis [108] . When PJP is suspected, high-dose co-trimoxazole and steroids should be added to the management of severe LRTI.",

Furthermore, many also develop chronic lung disease with bronchiectasis due to recurrent lung infections [110, 111] . In children with delayed ART initiation, nearly a third (28%) develop chronic lung disease with significantly compromised lung function [112] . This highlights the need for early ART initiation and universal ART access for all HIVinfected children to reduce the high burden of lung disease. Finally, vaccination, appropriate use of preventive therapy and early effective treatment of lung infections, including TB, are also essential to ensure optimal lung health in HIV-infected children.
