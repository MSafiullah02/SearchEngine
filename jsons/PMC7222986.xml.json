Initially, he was treated with hydromorphone and midazolam. His disease course was further complicated by prolonged hyperactive delirium which delayed liberation from the ventilator. Subsequently, his delirium was treated with quetiapine and as needed doses of enteral haloperidol up to 25mg every 12 hours and IV haloperidol 5 mg every 6 hours. However, his symptoms worsened paradoxically, and he developed a hypoactive component to the delirium. CT scan revealed only age related changes. Post-extubation, his examination showed diffuse weakness, intermittent resting tremor, cogwheeling with rigidity, hypomimia and a bilateral palmomental reflex. These clinical presentations were consistent with previously undiagnosed parkinsonism that had been unmasked during treatment with quetiapine and haloperidol.",
