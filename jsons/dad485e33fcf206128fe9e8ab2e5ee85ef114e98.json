IL-1b is a 'master' pro-inflammatory cytokine of the IL-1 cytokine family. It is important for autophagy and host defence against pathogens, but has also been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of auto-inflammatory diseases. Binding of IL-1b to its receptor results in transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and secretion of other IL-1 cytokine family members, such as IL-18 and IL-36 [26] . Cytokines of the IL-1 family induces secretion of IFNc by T helper cells [27, 28] . Moreover, it was recently shown that T-helper cells induce optimal secretion of IFNc through an autocrine IL-1b activity [29] . With respect to our data, this proposes that IL-1b is also a master regulator for activation and proliferation of protective antigen-specific T-cells in an allogeneic transplantation setting. Additionally, allogeneic stimulation per se has been shown to be beneficial in an in vitro study demonstrating that stimulation with viral antigens, binding EBV-and CMV-specific T-cells, in combination with allogeneic stimulation increased the number of antigenspecific T-cells and their effector function [30] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 780, "end": 784, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 860, "end": 864, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 865, "end": 868, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 992, "end": 996, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1501, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Complications after HSCT are multifactorial.

The authors did not evaluate T-cell clonal diversity in the stem cell products [31] . In light of the results presented here, perhaps the improved clinical outcome is not due to the T-cell dose per se, but rather an effect of the cell composition in regard to antigen-specificity. It seems that donor grafts with a wider repertoire of antigen-specific T-cells against common post-transplant infectious complications with a more pronounced cytokine production can be protective for the patient within 1-year post-transplantation and possibly longer.

Cytokines were analysed at day 7 in FASCIA culture supernatants. Results were divided based on presence of infection (I, n = 12) or no infection (NI, n = 9) in patients at the 1-year follow-up. (a) Box and whiskers plot showing PWM stimulated concentration of IFNc and IL-1b (in ng/ml) as well as IL-10 and IL-17 (in pg/ml) for stem cell products in the non-infection group (NI, checked boxes) and infection group (I, white boxes). Concentration of IL-10 and IL-17 (b) as well as IFNc and IL-1b (c) in supernatants from cultures stimulated with HSV (black bars), CMV (grey bars) or EBV (white bars) divided based on absence of infectious complications (NI) or infectious complications (I). *P-value <0\u00c105.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Recipient and donor clinical data", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Serology and FASCIA response for donor stem cells products", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>HSV serology </td><td>HSV FASCIA </td><td>EBV serology </td><td>EBV FASCIA </td><td>CMV serology </td><td>CMV FASCIA </td><td>VZV serology </td><td>VZV FASCIA\n</td></tr><tr><td>1 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>2 </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>4 </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P\n</td></tr><tr><td>5 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>6 </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>7 </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P\n</td></tr><tr><td>8 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>9 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>10 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>11 </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>12 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>13 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>14 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>- </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P\n</td></tr><tr><td>15 </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P\n</td></tr><tr><td>16 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>17 </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>18 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>- </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>19 </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>P\n</td></tr><tr><td>20 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>+ </td><td>P\n</td></tr><tr><td>21 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P\n</td></tr><tr><td>22 </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>- </td><td>P </td><td>- </td><td>N </td><td>+ </td><td>P\n</td></tr><tr><td>% Positive </td><td>41 </td><td>55a </td><td>77 </td><td>82a </td><td>50 </td><td>45a </td><td>100 </td><td>36a\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Viral reactivation 1-year post-transplant", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>No reactivation </td><td>Reactivation </td><td>P-value\n</td></tr><tr><td>CMV\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Pos FASCIA </td><td>5 </td><td>0\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Neg FASCIA </td><td>7 </td><td>9\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>% pos FASCIA </td><td>42 </td><td>0 </td><td>0045\n</td></tr><tr><td>EBV\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Pos FASCIA </td><td>14 </td><td>2\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Neg FASCIA </td><td>4 </td><td>1\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>% pos FASCIA </td><td>78 </td><td>67 </td><td>ns\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "We thank lab technicians at the Stem cell laboratory unit at Karolinska university hospital in Stockholm as well as Hans Gr\u20ac onlund for technical assistance.
