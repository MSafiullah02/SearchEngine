These measures initially received skeptical comments from most of the other countries, however in a matter of weeks most western countries followed in issuing similar drastic measures.

The regional healthcare authorities decided to create e Hub/Spoke system for cardiovascular and surgical emergencies, where a small number of large centers (Hubs: IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele Milano, Fondazione Poliambulanza Brescia, Centro Cardiologico Monzino Milano, ASST Milanese Ospedale di Legnano) would serve the whole region for non\u2013elective cases, while greatly limiting the number of elective ones. [At these centers the emergency admission of patients with respiratory (influenza \u2013 like) and non-respiratory symptoms are physically separated and follow different pathways (i.e. dedicated wards, elevators, radiology units etc.] This allowed most other hospitals (Spokes) to concentrate their resources for COVID-19 related cases. Moreover, a significant number of dedicated ICU beds have been made available in a matter of days at both publicly and privately-run centers. Clearly many further logistics adjustments had to be made in order to optimize the resources to this rapidly changing situation, moreover medical teaching also underwent radical changes.",
