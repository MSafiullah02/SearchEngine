            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), first described in the 1930s in the USA (Schalk & Hawn, 1931), is a coronavirus of chickens (Gallus gallus). IBV is a highly contagious virus and in addition to causing respiratory and kidney diseases can affect the reproductive organs, resulting in loss of production and poor egg quality (Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008). IBV belongs to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales and to the genus of the gamma-coronavirus (Gonzalez et al., 2003). It has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes four structural proteins\u2014spike (S), envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid\u2014and small non-structural proteins (Cavanagh, 2007). The spike is formed by post-translational cleavage of two parts, S1 and S2. The carboxy-terminal S2 subunit is a conserved structure found in coronaviruses of different species that anchors S1 to the viral envelope and is also responsible for membrane fusion (Cavanagh, 2007). The amino-terminal subunit S1 is important in viral attachment and is a major virus-neutralizing antibody site (Cavanagh et al., 1986; Casais et al., 2003). S1 contains hypervariable regions that are able to change very easily through mutation or recombination (Kusters et al., 1990; Cavanagh et al., 1992). The molecular identification of IBV is based mainly on the analysis of the S1 protein gene (De Wit, 2000).",

Infectious bronchitis (IB) can be managed through sound biosecurity principles and vaccination. However, control by vaccination is difficult because of antigenic variation in the virus. Outbreaks of the disease can occur even in vaccinated flocks following small changes to the amino acids in the S1 protein of IBV, which can result in a decrease in cross-protection (Cavanagh et al., 1992). However, in some cases there is a high level of cross-protection against other strains with a low homology, for which the term protectotype was introduced (Dhinakar Raj & Jones, 1996; Cook et al., 1999). To date, many different genotypes of IBV have been identified. A survey revealed that the predominant ones in European countries were 793B (4/91), Massachusetts, Italy02 and QX (Worthington et al., 2008).",

Organ suspension (kidneys and oviducts) was tested for IBV using embryo inoculation and RT-PCR. The embryos showed changes typical of IBV infection, including curling and decreased growth and weight. The RT-PCR was positive for IBV and further phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus (Li3817/2011) belonged to the genotype QX, sharing a minimum of 97% nucleotide identity with strains circulating widely in Europe (Yu et al., 2001).

Histological examination of the trachea, lungs and kidneys revealed a multifocal lymphocytic inflammation. No haemagglutinating agents were found in the allantoic fluids of the eggs inoculated with the sample, thus excluding avian influenza and Newcastle disease. The virus (Li5811/2011) was partially sequenced and the genotype of the virus was established as QX, sharing only 91.5% nucleotide identity with the Li3817/2011 strain isolated from the layer flock in March 2011 (Case 1). Interestingly, the isolate from Case 2 had a unique amino acid sequence \u201cLDKG\u201d at amino acids 117 to 122 of the S1 protein (numbering is according to the strain CK/SWE/0658946/10, JQ088078; Abro et al., 2012), including a deletion of two amino acids. Most QX strains possess the amino acid sequence \u201cSSGSGS\u201d in this position.",

The first virus isolated, belonging to the QX genotype, emerged in a layer flock in the southeast of Finland. IB strains belonging to the QX genotype have been associated with nephritis, proventriculitis and the false-layer syndrome (Wang et al., 1996; Yu et al., 2001; Beato et al., 2005). In Case 2, the virus belonging to the QX genotype was found in an emaciated hen in a backyard flock. The farm is located approximately 300 km from the Case 1 farm. Based on the relatively low nucleotide identity (91.5%) between the two QX viruses (Li3817/2011 and Li5811/2011), it is apparent that they had different origins. The unique 117LDKG120 sequence in the S1-protein of Li5811/2011 might represent a recombination event between QX and unknown IB strains. Based on the published sequences in GenBank, only strains related to the Massachusetts strain appear to have a two amino acid deletion at this site. There has been no evidence of this virus spreading in Finland and the origins of the two sporadic infections remain unknown. Considering the highly contagious nature of IBV, it is surprising that the virus did not spread to other farms.",

Backyard flocks can be more susceptible to infectious diseases because of their close contact with wild birds (De Wit et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013) and on some occasions novel infectious diseases are known to emerge first in backyard flocks (Capua et al., 2002). Although IBV-like coronaviruses have been recovered from wild birds, there is as yet no evidence for long-distance transmission of these viruses (Muradrasoli et al., 2009). Another explanation for the emergence of this genotype could be an illegal import of hobby chickens. In a small-sized hobby flock, clinical signs associated with IB can go unnoticed by the owner and the threshold to call the veterinarian may be high. Further serological testing of backyard poultry flocks revealed IB antibodies in 73% of the flocks tested. This suggests that IBV is common among such populations.",
