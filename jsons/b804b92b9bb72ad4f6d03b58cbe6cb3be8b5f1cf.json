Cone and outside pressures, the much lower available space per occupant in aircraft cabins, and the need for coping with more extreme external temperatures than are common at ground level. The breadth of these concerns is of interest in the policies and regulatory aspects of a number of agencies which are briefly described, and their roles and areas of potential interest outlined. Types of possible contaminants are listed, and the limits which have been set by several of these agencies for many of these potential contaminants are tabulated. In addition recent measured aircraft cabin concentrations of several key contaminants are listed. This chapter provides an overview of the general air quality variables affecting enclosed space to enable these to be related to the special needs of some of the less common enclosed spaces described in the following chapters.",

The combination of high occupant density, relatively low ventilation rates, and varying but potentially long occupancy periods up to 18 hours on some intercontinen-tal flights create the potential for adverse health impacts. Aircraft cabins are a uniquely challenging environment. As Hocking has noted, aircraft cabins have the smallest available airspace per person of any current social environment, and occupants of a fully loaded aircraft typically have about 35-70 ft 3 (1-2 m 3 ) of available airspace per person, approximately 1/10th that of a typical office worker or a spectator in an auditorium [1] . In 2003, the US National Academy of Sciences [2] (NAS) released its latest report, funded by the Federal Aviation Administration. The NAS report, most importantly, recommends that air quality in commercial aircraft be monitored with routine surveillance of air-quality characteristics such as ozone, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, fine particulate matter, cabin pressure, relative humidity, and temperature. In addition, it called for a detailed research program to be launched to investigate specific questions about the possible association between air contaminants and observed or reported health effects.",

The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) was adopted in 1970 to regulate health and safety provisions for workers (Public Law 91-516). Exemptions from OSHA coverage included workers in industries regulated by other agencies such as the Airlines (FAA), Railroads (Federal Railway Administration), maritime workers, and federal, state and local government workers. The FAA exercised its option to regulate the safety and health of airline cabin workers beginning in 1975 (40 FR 29114, DOT 1975). Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) that have been subsequently promulgated by the FAA to govern air quality in commercial aircraft so far include O 3 , CO, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), ventilation, and cabin pressure (14 CFR 21, 14 CFR 25, 14 CFR 121, and 14 CFR 125) .

Reduced ventilation rates in buildings have been linked to increased reports of health symptoms and sick leave, but whether building ventilation standards are appropriate for airplanes has not been determined. Studies of transmission of infectious airborne diseases such as tuberculosis during flights suggest that the spread of infectious agents during flights does not appear to be facilitated by aircraft ventilation systems, but rather by the high density of people, the committee concluded. An aircraft's environmental control system itself can be a source of contamination during abnormal operations when engine oil, hydraulic fluids, or de-icing solutions enter the cabin through the air-supply system in what is called \"bleed air\". Many crews and passengers have reported \"air quality incidents\" involving smoke or odors 296 J.E. Cone within cabins.

Despite the above concerns, and the work of several active committees tasked with such standard development for over the past 10 years, there are currently no accepted International, North American or European standards for the air/environmental quality within aircraft cabins. In light of these developments, and in particular, the worldwide SARS epidemic of 2003, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has called for a national standard for airplane cabin air quality [5] . The absence of US regulations addressing a wider range of additional cabin air contaminants and environmental factors is the source of significant concern on the part of airline industry workers, unions and the flying public.

If properly developed and maintained they represent the combined knowledge of designers, manufacturers, and consumers and are useful as benchmarks for industry, providing a way to insure compatibility, comparability, enabling mass production and a means of measuring and testing of products [6]. Common weaknesses of standards include failure to prevent contamination due to conflict of interest in standards setting organizations, failure of standards setting bodies to update standards with new information or changes in technology, and failure of enforcement. Federal regulatory agencies other than the US FAA (with its limited set of airline cabin environmental standards), such as the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have not established exposure limits for the unique environment of aircraft, nor are their existing standards necessarily appropriate for this environment.

OSHA is the primary federal agency responsible for maintaining minimal standards for indoor air of workplaces. The setting of standards for workers would have spill-over benefits in terms of potentially protecting passengers and the general public, although workplace standards are often significantly less stringent compared with standards for the environment of the general public, including potentially more susceptible populations. The National Ad-298 J.E. Cone visory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health (NACOSH) has noted \"since consensus standards were first adopted in the two years after the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, a relatively small number of standards have been promulgated. Further, standards such as Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL) have not been successfully updated. The average time to develop and promulgate a standard is ten years .... During the time these important standards were under consideration, hundreds of workers continued to be killed or seriously injured annually by these hazards\". NACOSH made recommendations for streamlining and speeding up the standard setting process. However, underlying problems causing the ineffectiveness of OSHA standard setting, including lack of political will in administrations fundamentally opposed to regulation and the increasing weakness of unions compared with corporate interests, were not addressed. Some states that opt to have state OSHA plans have had more success in updating and adopting standards. This is permitted as long as they adopt standards that are at least as effective as the federal standards. Even in the best states, however, there is a relative lack of systematic scientific or worker input into the standard setting process, resulting in the tendency toward wholesale and uncritical adoption of industry \"consensus\" standards such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' Threshold Limit Values.",

This effort started in 1946. The membership of ACGIH represents industry, government, academia and to a diminishing extent, labor organizations and was drawn from four disciplines: industrial hygiene, toxicology, occupational medicine and occupational epidemiology. The TLV Committee sets guidelines and recommendations, not regulations, and they publish an annual booklet of recommended limits for chemical substances and physical agents, primarily for use by industrial hygienists. According to the preface of the TLV booklet, TLVs \"are health-based recommendations derived from assessment of the available published scientific information from studies in exposed humans and from studies in experimental animals\" [7] . Criticism of the TLV development process has focused on the lack of adequate documentation of the committee's decision-making processes, lack of an effective means of preventing conflicts of interest from tainting committee decisions [8] , and lack of explicit scientific rationale or health basis [9] for many of the TLV's that have been developed. Nevertheless, the TLV's tend to be more protective than current Federal OSHA regulations, and are more frequently updated. As Peter Montague has noted, \"During the 20 years that OSHA spent setting 12 new PELs, the ACGIH TLV Committee revised 234 TLVs downward, making them more protective (and stricter than the corresponding PELs which had been adopted in 1970 but never revised), and adopted 168 new TLVs for which there were no PELs\" [10] .",

The purpose of ASHRAE Standard 62, as defined in Sect. 1, is to \"specify minimum ventilation rates and indoor air quality that will be acceptable to human occupants and are intended to minimize the potential for adverse health effects\". The scope of Standard 62 \"applies to all indoor or enclosed spaces that people may occupy, except where other applicable standards and requirements dictate larger amounts of ventilation than this standard\". This guideline is voluntary, and has not been adopted by the FAA. Most useful for aircraft environments may be the standard for comfort (odor) criteria with respect to human bioeffluents. In addition, ASHRAE recommends that indoor CO 2 concentrations be maintained less than 700 ppm above the outdoor air concentration [11] , Table 4 . As the NAS 2002 report has pointed out, ASHRAE Standard 62-1999 is also generally more restrictive than FAA's FAR 25 with respect to both O 3 and CO [12] . In addition, it states that [13] \"Assuming that the cabin temperature and pressure apply, and not the outside conditions, it is seen that ASHRAE Standard 62-1999 would require 50-100% more outside air than the current requirement in FAR 25\".",

A petition was first submitted in 1969 to the US FAA to request federal action to control tobacco smoking aboard aircraft [28] . The FAA did not act on the petition, taking the position that tobacco smoke was not likely to be a health problem for those exposed to second-hand smoke aboard aircraft. The US Civil Aeronautics Board was more receptive and beginning in 1973 began regulating smoking aboard aircraft primarily through establishing no-smoking zones in the cabin and separating cigar and pipe smokers. A series of federal reports were published in 1986 summarizing the mounting scientific evidence for harmful health effects of passive smoking, including The health consequences of involuntary smoking, by the US Surgeon General [29] , and the US National Academy of Sciences report, Environmental tobacco smoke: measuring exposures and assessing health effects [30] . In addition, the US National Academy of Sciences published, in the same year, The airliner cabin environment, its first report on Cabin Air Quality [31] that proposed banning smoking from all flights within the US. Despite the efforts of the tobacco industry, in 1988, a law to ban smoking aboard US domestic flights of less than two hours went into effect. In 1990, Congress made the ban on smoking on domestic flights permanent and expanded it to include all domestic flights of six hours or less [32] . Most international airlines banned smoking in the 1990s. Finally, smoking was banned from all domestic and international flights to and from the US in 2000. A few airlines internationally continue to allow smoking on flights [33] .",

Air distribution is accomplished by single (narrow body aircraft) or multiple diffusers (wide body aircraft) located in the middle of the ceiling in the aisles, above the windows, or near the overhead baggage compartments. The NAS has noted that \"Adequate temperature control in the cabin requires that conditioned air be supplied to the cabin at about 0.65 kg/min (1.4 lb/min) per person to maintain a comfortable temperature. This requirement is more than twice the FAR 25 requirement of 0.25 kg/min per person for outside air\".",

Possible policy and action options for the future include: 1. Implementation of NAS recommendations for additional sampling and research. This will provide a better scientific basis for future standard setting activities. 2. It is the role of FAA to promulgate appropriate cabin environmental standards for the wide range of contaminants and other environmental quality parameters potentially impacting crew and passengers.",
