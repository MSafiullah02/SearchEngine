Some chemicals may cause the breakdown of the glove material.2Use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or vinyl gloves should be limited to brief, low-risk exposures.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Research has shown that PVC and vinyl gloves have a high failure rate in use.3Users should refer to the glove manufacturer's written instructions for use with chemicals (eg, glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, methyl methacrylate). When handling glutaraldehyde solutions, gloves that are impervious to glutaraldehyde should be worn.12 Gloves should be changed immediately following direct contact with uncured methyl methacrylate (ie, bone cement). Exposure to uncured methyl methacrylate places the wearer at risk for direct contact with and skin absorption of the methyl methacrylate because it permeates the glove material. Users should contact the specific glove manufacturer and request written reports on specific glove styles and materials for the intrinsic ability of the glove to protect the wearer when exposed to chemotherapeutics, chemical agents, and bloodborne pathogens.4Exam gloves should be inspected upon donning, and changed after each patient contact, or when\n\u2022a visible defect is noted,\u2022perforation is suspected, and\u2022according to organizational policy.\n5Sterile surgical gloves should be inspected immediately upon donning and before contact with sterile supplies and tissue.13 Sterile gloves should be changed\n\u2022after each patient contact;\u2022when a visible defect is noted;\u2022when suspected or actual contamination occurs;\u2022when a suspected or actual perforation from a needle, suture, bone, or other event occurs;\u2022immediately following direct contact with uncured methyl methacrylate (ie, bone cement) because the wearer is at risk for direct contact and skin absorption of the methyl methacrylate via penetration of the glove material;14\n\u2022when an unintentional electrical shock from an electrosurgical unit (ESU) is received to the hand(s) of the user;15\n\u2022when gloves begin to swell, expand, and become loose on the wearer's hands, as a result of the material's absorption (hydration) of fluid and fats; and\u2022according to organizational policy.\n6All end users should be familiar with the intended use and the limitations of each glove material.16 Each surgical glove material has specific characteristics (eg, latex, polyisoprene, chloroprene) which affect the performance and intended use of the glove.7Gloves should not be washed between patient contacts or uses. Research has found that pathogens are not effectively removed from gloves by washing.4 Washing gloves is not a substitute for hand washing.8Health care workers must wear masks to protect the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth during procedures and activities that generate splashes, splatters, sprays, or aerosols of blood or other potentially infectious materials.2\n9Health care workers must wear protective eye wear when a splatter is anticipated.2\n10Health care workers must wear a face shield if a splash is anticipated.2\n11Health care workers must wear fluid-resistant attire to protect skin and clothing during activities that generate splashes, splatters, sprays, or aerosols of blood or other potentially infectious materials. Personal protective equipment is required and must be used whenever exposure to potentially infectious materials is anticipated. The type of PPE required depends upon the type of exposure anticipated. Work garments, such as scrub attire and warm-up jackets, are not considered PPE because they are not impervious to strike-through of hazardous materials.2\n\n",

Changes in surgical practice to minimize manual manipulation of sharps (ie, neutral zone or no-touch techniques) can have a major effect on these injuries. Creation of a neutral zone (ie, where instruments are put down and picked up, rather than passed hand-to-hand) may decrease injuries from sharp instruments.2\n\u2022All sharps must be handled, removed, and disposed of properly. Contaminated sharps should be disposed of in a puncture-resistant, labeled, color-coded, leak-proof container.2, 29 This type of container helps prevent injuries to personnel cleaning the room or equipment after use. Used needles must not be sheared, bent, broken, recapped, or resheathed by hand. If recapping is required, mechanical devices or the one-hand technique must be used.2 Removable knife blades should be handled using an instrument or device.\u2022Reusable sharps must be handled, removed, and sequestered at the end of the procedure in a labeled, puncture-resistant, closed transportation container. Removable, reusable sharps should be handled using an instrument or device.\n\n",
