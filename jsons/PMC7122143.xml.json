Antibiotics are ineffective and inappropriate treatment for the common cold and should be avoided in adults and children [17, 18]. Over the counter cough and cold medications should be avoided in all children younger than 4 years due to the potential for harm and lack of benefit. Products shown to improve cold symptoms in children include vapor rub, zinc sulfate, extract, and buckwheat honey, although the quality of the evidence varies. Ineffective treatments for children include both inhaled and oral corticosteroids and Echinacea. Among adults, decongestants, antihistamine/decongestant combinations, and intranasal ipratropium have been shown to improve cold symptoms [17, 18]. Additionally, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to relieve discomfort due to colds but not to improve respiratory symptoms [19]. When taken within 24 h of symptom onset, zinc has been shown to reduce the duration of common cold symptoms in healthy adults [20]. plant preparations have not proven effective in treating common colds among adults [21]. In supplementation trials, regular use of vitamin C did not decrease the incidence of common colds, but did have a positive effect on symptom duration and severity. Therapeutic trials of vitamin C during a cold have not shown a significant effect on common cold symptom reduction, but it may be worth considering in individual cases given its favorable safety profile and low cost [\n22].",

Current recommendations call for annual influenza vaccination for all individuals greater than 6 months of age. The LAIV is recommended over the IIV for children ages 2\u20138 when immediately available if the child has no contraindications to the live attenuated vaccine. When vaccine supply is limited, preference should be given to those at higher risk, including children age 6\u201359 months, adults >50 years of age, those with immunosuppression or other severe chronic disease including morbid obesity, women who are or will become pregnant during the influenza season, residents of long-term care facilities, and Native Americans/Native Alaskans [32]. At this time, vaccination demonstrates a minimal effect on symptomatic influenza in otherwise healthy adults, with one case prevented for every 71 adults vaccinated [33].
