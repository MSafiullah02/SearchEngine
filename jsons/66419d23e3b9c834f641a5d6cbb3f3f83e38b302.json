We used an analysis of correlation to evaluate the associations between the proportion of travellers departing from Wuhan and four indexes of the extent of amplification of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the top 100 cities. The proportions of travellers departing from Wuhan in the top 100 cities were not normally distributed. Thus, a Spearman correlation analysis was applied. Besides, the correlations between the socioeconomic factors and two indexes of the extent of amplification of the outbreak of COVID-19 were analyzed. In addition, we did the scatter plots and the regression curves. Considering the health system for COVID-19 in Hubei Province differs from that in other areas and the results may depend on data quality of district health systems, a subgroup analysis according the district health systems was performed. The data were analyzed by SPSS statistic 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Illinois, Chicago, USA). All statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.COVID-19 cases in top 100 cities in ChinaUp to Feb 11, 2020, 44, 653 confirmed COVID-19 infections in China mainland with a total of 4740 recovered cases. Of these, a total of 25095 confirmed cases were reported in China outside of Wuhan. The top 100 cities are located in four municipalities (i.e. Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Tianjin) and 16 provinces or autonomous regions in China. Overall, a total of 21807 cases (86.9%) were reported in the selected top 100 cities with 13798 cases (54.98%) in 15 cities in Hubei Province. There are 15 cities except Wuhan in Hubei Province. The hot spots of COVID-19 cases were the other 15 cities in Hubei province and the cities in neighboring provinces including Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. Meanwhile, several well-developed areas, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong Province, and Zhejiang Province also showed a high proportion of COVID-19 cases. Comparisons between proportions of travellers departing from Wuhan and proportions of cases in the top 100 cities in China Figure 1A shows the comparison between the proportions of travellers departing from Wuhan and proportions of cases in the selected top 100 cities in China. Between Jan 10, 2020 and Jan 24, 2020, 91.68% of all travellers departing from Wuhan travelled to the top 100 cities, with 69.34% of them to other 15 cities in Hubei province. The areas with a high proportion of travellers departing from Wuhan were correlated with a high proportion of COVID-19 cases. Compared to the proportion of travellers departing from Wuhan, most areas showed a lower proportion of cases. However, several well-developed areas, such as Zhejiang Province, Guangdong Province, Shanghai, andBeijing, showed a significantly higher proportion of cases compared to the proportion of travellers departing from Wuhan.
