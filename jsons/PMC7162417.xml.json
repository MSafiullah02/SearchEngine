The McGuigan research group discovered and developed the anti\u2010HCV agent INX\u2010189, a ProTide of 6\u2010O\u2010methyl\u20102\u2032\u2010C\u2010methyl guanosine (1).9 At that time, this compound was the most potent inhibitor of HCV replication in cell\u2010based replication assays (EC50=0.01 \u03bcm, EC90=0.04 \u03bcm, CC50=7 \u03bcm). Critically, it generated significantly higher levels of the 6\u2010O\u2010methyl\u20102\u2032\u2010C\u2010methyl guanosine triphosphate than the parent nucleoside and had a half\u2010life of >24 h. Given the excellent pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles of INX\u2010189, it was chosen as a clinical candidate that was then developed by Inhibitex Inc.10 Following successful early clinical results, INX\u2010189 was acquired by Bristol\u2010Myers Squibb (BMS) and studied in phase III clinical trials in combination with daclatasvir, another anti\u2010HCV experimental drug of BMS. However, cardiotoxicity was observed, and further development was suspended.11\n",

As a result of the impressive early data from the clinical trials of these two agents, they were acquired by Gilead Sciences, Inc. Out of the two compounds, PSI\u20107977, which subsequently became GS\u20107977, successfully completed clinical evaluations and became known as sofosbuvir (SovaldiTM), the first ProTide approved for clinical use against HCV.",

Impressively, the ProTide GS\u20107340 generated 10\u2010 to 30\u2010fold higher levels of tenofovir and its phosphorylated metabolites following incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir, respectively.16 Although GS\u20107340 is similar to the FDA\u2010approved tenofovir disoproxil, it is more potent, and thus in phase III clinical studies therapeutic effects were achieved at lower doses with fewer incidences of side effects.

Coupling this to the large number of ProTides that are currently undergoing preclinical evaluation, it is safe to say that more ProTides will progress into clinical studies, increasing the chances of more ProTides being approved in the future to treat viral infections and cancer. This has been made possible by the pioneering work of Prof. Chris McGuigan that started in the early 1990s, and which years later yielded the ProTide technology as we know it today. Since its development, the ProTide technology has been widely adopted and adapted by academic research groups, as well as small and large pharmaceutical companies to discover new medicines that have already improved treatment outcomes and consequently the quality of life of many patients.",
