The Taiwan-Japan joint symposium on structural biology using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, chaired by myself and Prof. Ken Yokoyama from Kyoto Sangyo University, was held as a session in the BSJ meeting in Miyazaki Japan in the afternoon of 25th September 2019. In this symposium, six researchers from Taiwan and Japan presented cutting-edge results using the two methods as described below.",

The group of Profs. Kishikawa and Yokoyama have solved the cryo-EM structures of a whole V-ATPase complex from Thermus thermophilus at low to middle resolution (Nakanishi et al. 2018). Recently, they have succeeded in solving the cryo-EM structure of the Vo part at a higher resolution.

Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-catalyzed citrullination has been shown to play an emerging role as a potential cancer therapeutic target (Liu et al. 2017). Prof. Hung and her group have elucidated that p53 protein can be citrullinated by PAD4 in vitro and in the cell. Structural and functional analysis demonstrated that citrullination has detrimental effects on p53 tetramerization and thus impairs their DNA-binding ability. In her talk, she presented direct evidence of the PAD4-p53 interaction and proposed a potential mechanism of how PAD4 involves in p53 target gene regulation by citrullinating p53.",

Right: Schematic model of the V-ATPase. The V1 part is composed of a hexameric arrangement of alternating A and B subunits responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. The Vo part, in which rotational energy is converted to drive H+ (or Na+) translocation, is composed of oligomers of the c subunits and an a subunit. The V1 and Vo parts are connected by a central stalk, which is composed of D, F, and d subunits, and two peripheral stalks, which are composed of E and G subunits of V1. ATP hydrolysis induces the rotation of the central stalk (DFd complex) and an attached c ring, which causes ion pumping at the interface between the c ring and a subunit",
