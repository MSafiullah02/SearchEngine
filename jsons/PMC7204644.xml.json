The authors suggest that this may be due to limited opportunities to engage in a healthy lifestyle (including exercise) and the reduced accessibility of anti-diabetic medications and medical advice. We agree that the varying lockdown measures may have a direct impact on diabetes management (HbA1c control) as diabetes (particularly for type 2 diabetes) is often managed with lifestyle strategies such as exercise, diet modification, and self-monitoring of blood glucose and not exclusively through anti-diabetic medications [2,3].",

For instance, in Australia, going out to exercise has been approved and encouraged as one of the \u2018essential activities\u2019. While it remains to be known what the uptake of exercising has been, previous Australian evidence suggests that members of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities, including South Asians, have lower physical activity levels [4].",

We posit that with the current isolation and lockdown measures, these incidental activities will be greatly reduced with a corresponding increase in sedentary behaviours. To help with the management of diabetes more purposive forms of physical activity are required [6]. It remains unknown whether this increase is happening among South Asian migrants for whom purposive exercise was perceived to be an inherent part of the Anglo-Australian identity and not fitting with their own ethnic identity [5].",
