            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is an arbovirus transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. It belongs to Flavivirus genus of Flaviviridae family and contains a positive single-stranded RNA genome. DENV can be antigenically classified into four serotypes (DENV-1\u20134), which are often co-circulating in the endemic regions with similar clinical manifestations. Though the majority of DENV infections are asymptomatic, a minority of which can result in self-limited disease including dengue fever (DF), and less than 1% may develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Because of the global warming, increased air travel, and the lack of an efficacious vaccine, DENV has become the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral pathogen in recent decades (Guzman et al.2010). Each year, DENV is estimated to infect 390 million people globally, affecting nearly half of the world population. Asia accounts for 75% of the dengue disease burden, followed by Latin America and Africa (Bhatt et al.2013). As an imported pathogen in China, dengue virus had caused sporadic outbreaks in southern China before 2013. However, an unexpected large dengue outbreak attacked Guangzhou in 2014, resulting in 46,864 national reported cases that year (Jin et al.2015), in which the majority was caused by dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1), and the others by serotype 2 (DENV-2) (Zhao et al.2016; Li et al.2017). Since then, 2000\u20135000 confirmed cases were reported to China CDC (Chinese Centers for Disease control and Prevention) each year.",

Naturally acquired dengue virus does not infect any outbred or inbred mice, unless viruses are inoculated with extremely high dose (e.g. 10\u22129 PFU of DENV-2 16681 in 4-week old C57/BL6) (Chen et al.2007) or through intracerebral injection. In some other models, mouse-brain adapted strains are used. But such infection of adapted strain or intracerebral infection usually results in neurological manifestations, which are not routine clinical signs of human diseases. And, after passaging in mice, characteristics of these mouse brain-adapted viral strains may differ from strains naturally acquired, attenuation in their ability to cause human disease was documented (Sabin and Schlesinger 1945; Hotta 1952; Sarathy et al.2015). Thus, the inability of dengue virus to replicate in murine model had hampered the development of dengue vaccine and antiviral therapy. Monkey models, while more useful, are not suitable for routine preclinical testing of vaccine candidates or drug prototypes because of their high cost, limited animal availability and ethical concerns.",

            "text": "The species specificity of DENV infection may be partially attributed to the differences of innate immunity between primates and mice. Interferon (IFN) signaling plays an essential role in the protection against dengue disease in humans, nevertheless DENV has also evolved many mechanisms to antagonize IFN signaling and IFN production in vivo (Green et al.2014). One of them is the binding and degradation of human STAT2 by dengue viral protein NS5 (Ashour et al.2010). Another is the cleavage of human STING molecules by dengue viral protease NS2B3 (Aguirre et al.2012; Yu et al.2012). Interestingly, both of these two antagonistic mechanisms only exist in human. DENV NS5 does not bind to murine STAT2, neither does NS2B3 cleave murine STING proteins, because the target sequences on these two molecules are highly species specific (Ashour et al.2010; Aguirre et al.2012; Stabell et al.2018). But deletion of mSTAT2 or mSTING could enhance the replication of DENV in mouse or mouse derived primary cells (Ashour et al.2010; Aguirre et al.2012). These observations also imply the necessity of IFN signaling and IFN production in restricting DENV infection in mice.",

As humanized mice are laborious to prepare, and often introduce mouse-to-mouse variation, they are less suitable for application in vaccine development (Akkina et al.2011). In contrast, knockout mice are easier to manipulate and a series of IFN deficient mice have been tested in the development of dengue infection model, including those of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212, IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212, MAVS\u2212/\u2212, STAT1\u2212/\u2212, STAT2\u2212/\u2212, IRF3\u2212/\u2212 and IRF7\u2212/\u2212 (Shresta et al.2006; Perry et al.2011; Prestwood et al.2012). Among them, type I/II IFN receptors double knock out mice usually develop lethal diseases when challenged with suitable DENV strains, thus are used more frequently. However, only a limited number of dengue virus strains are able to replicate in mice and reproduce the severe symptoms (e.g., vascular leakage) of human disease. These viruses are usually based on clinical isolates (DENV-3 C0360/94, DENV-3 703-4, DENV-4 TVP-376), obtained through alternate passage between mosquito C6/36 cells and AG129 mice (DENV-2 D2S10), or isolated after plaque-purification (DENV-2 D2Y98P-PP1, DENV-2 S221) (Sarathy et al.2015).

After incubation for 96 h at 37 \u00b0C, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).

When the PCR product concentration was high enough, they were sent directly for sequencing.

Three colonies containing each of the fragments were sequenced. Full-length sequence of the single open reading frame was achieved based on the consensus sequence of each fragment, and then stringed together by overlapping them with each other.

It is observed that infection of either virus led to 100% mortality within 7\u201311 days, even at a dose as low as 103 PFU, though DENV-2 8H2-7-LP caused more weight loss and faster death than DENV-2 1D4-5-SP at the same dosage.

As a mixture of two types of viral variants, the parental strain was also able to cause weight loss and lethal diseases in AG6 mice. Comparing to the two purified variants, the parental quasispecies presented intermediate level of pathology, which was most obvious in the dose groups of 105 PFU. Through Evans blue staining, we also detected plasma leakage in sick mice on day 7 post infection by either DENV-2 8H2-7-LP or DENV-2 1D4-5-SP viruses (Fig. 4).

The viral RNA of DENV-2 8H2-7-LP could be detected throughout the week after infection, and the peak RNA level of about 106 genomic copy per microgram total RNA was reached on day 3 post infection, followed by gradually dropping to 104 copy on the 7th day (Fig. 5A). In contrast, viral RNA of DENV-2 1D4-5-SP was not detected until day 4 post infection, when merely 104 copy per microgram of total RNA was transiently detected for 2 days. Consistently, infectious virus was detected in sera of DENV-2 8H2-7-LP infected mice from 2 to 4 dpi, during which peak viremia of 103 PFU/mL appeared on day 3 post infection. Meanwhile, infectious virus was not detectable in mice infected by DENV-2 1D4-5-SP (lower than detection limit of 20 PFU/mL) (Fig. 5B). Moreover, 8H2-7-LP viral RNA was also detected in liver, spleen and eyes on 3 dpi (Fig. 5C), further confirming replication of 8H2-7-LP in susceptible organs. The parental strain also replicated in Balb/c mice (Fig. 5A and 5B), and the kinetics of viremia were closer to that of 8H2-7-LP, except for the delay of peak viremia to the 4th day post infection in both assays.",

On the other hand, DENV-2 8H2-7-LP was used in another infection model which resembles self-limited infection of dengue virus in Balb/c mice. And this transient infection model is more suitable for study of T cell responses, since the immune cell lineages are intact and the IFN-\u03b3 responses are normal during the development of adaptive immunity.

One often used virus is dengue serotype-2 strain D220, which was obtained from a neuropathic strain PL046 through alternative passage between C6/36 mosquito cells and AG129 mice. The LD50 of this virus in AG129 is 105\u2013106 PFU (Orozco et al.2012). Another is D2Y98P-PP1, a double-plaque purified clone from a laboratory strain D2Y98P, which had been passaged in C6/36 cell for 20 times. And the lethal dose of D2Y98P-PP1 in AG129 mice was documented higher than 105 PFU (Tan et al.2011). In contrast, the virus strains in this study had 100% mortality within 11 days after inoculation in AG6 mice of 6\u20138 weeks old even when the dose was reduced to 103 PFU, i.e., approximately 100 times more lethal than the D220 and D2Y98P-PP1 viral strains, and thus making DENV-2 8H2-7-LP virus a unique tool for studying the pathogenesis of dengue virus. Through Evans blue staining, we also confirmed the manifestation of plasma leakage in infected mice, which is a characteristic of severe dengue diseases in human.
