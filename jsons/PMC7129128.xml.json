First, countries often insist on maintaining their sovereignty in matters of health. As a result, governments may fail to adhere to international health norms or cooperate with international agencies such as WHO. Second, most international public-health law is concerned with horizontal governance\u2014ie, the regulation of travel and trade among sovereign nations.2 Consequently, international law often entails border controls rather than globally established health rules that require, for example, strong national public-health capacities. Finally, the powerful high-income countries have inordinate influence on the global health agenda. Their concern is primarily to prevent movement of infections from the developing to the developed world rather than to alleviate endemic diseases in poorer regions such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. Powerful countries also have failed to provide the technical assistance and resources necessary to improve health in developing countries.",

This new approach is preferable because it is flexible, future-oriented, and covers all hazards (radiological, chemical, and biological), whether naturally occurring, accidental, or intentional. WHO should continually specify the kinds of health conditions encompassed within this broad definition.

Indeed, countries have built-in disincentives to openly monitor and report infectious diseases. Public notification of health threats can adversely affect a country's economy and prestige. It can trigger media coverage or travel advisories affecting trade and tourism, and adversely affect the reputation and electoral prospects of political leaders. Global surveillance can be substantially improved by effective vertical governance. First, WHO could establish criteria for uniform data sets, core informational requirements, and timely monitoring and reporting. These norms would help set a standard for national and global surveillance. Second, WHO should expand its data sources beyond official government channels. \u201cSmall-world networks\u201d consisting of scientists, health professionals, membership associations, and non-governmental organisations could considerably broaden the sources of health information. Finally, WHO should use modern technology for surveillance including electronic health records and the internet to gather and analyse surveillance data. WHO is already beginning this process, which could be enhanced through the revised IHRs.",

As the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks demonstrated, prompt and efficient monitoring and response at the national level is critically important to prevent the proliferation of disease.5 To improve national competencies, WHO should set minimum standards for laboratories, data systems, and response. By setting performance standards and measuring outcomes, WHO could continually help member states evaluate their public-health preparedness. Compliance with international health norms has been a serious problem. It is therefore important for WHO to adopt measures to enhance conformance with global health norms. This could be accomplished through a combination of hard and soft law: mediation, adjudication, and incentives. A related problem is that poor countries cannot, without help, meet minimum standards for public-health preparedness. The international community, therefore, should substantially increase technical and financial assistance for health-system improvement in developing countries.",

Health measures may also be applied inequitably leading to discrimination against unpopular groups such as migrants and ethnic minorities. The IHRs could demonstrate respect for human rights by incorporating the internationally accepted norms contained in the Siracusa principles, which require health measures to be necessary, proportionate, and fair.6 Health measures should be based on the rule of law and provide natural justice for persons whose liberty is placed in jeopardy.",
