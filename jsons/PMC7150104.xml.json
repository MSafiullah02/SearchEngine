Despite the availability of antibiotic therapy and severity of illness assessments, pneumonia continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide. In the elderly population, the impact of pneumonia is greater than in other age groups. The mechanisms that increase the incidence and mortality rates in elderly pneumonia patients are not fully understood. The immunological changes that called immunosenescence are known to be responsible for the increased sensitivity of elderly people to infection diseases.",

The annual incidence of pneumonia in the elderly is four-times that of the younger population. Older adults have also higher rates of hospitalization and mortality (Chong and Street, 2008). Therefore, a better understanding of the pathophysiology, microbiology, treatment, and prevention of this common affliction is required. For proper diagnosis and treatment advice, pneumonia is classified as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) along with the recent guidelines.",

These changes cause an increase in functional residual capacity. Elderly patients thus breathe at higher lung volumes with increased workload imposed on respiratory muscles. Calcification of the rib cage leads to stiffening of the chest wall and decreased compliance. As a result of osteoporosis, vertebral fractures result in dorsal kyphosis and negative effect on its force-generating capabilities. Nutritional deficiencies and age-associated sarcopenia decrease the respiratory muscle strength also. Decreased muscle strength has been described also in patients with chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), Parkinson\u2019s disease and cerebrovascular disease. These comorbidities are frequently seen in elderly. An additional load on respiratory muscles as are pneumonia may lead to hypoventilation and respiratory failure.",

In these patients, there is a high incidence of silent aspiration. In patients with neurological impairment of the glottic barrier, gastrostomy or nasogastric tubes there is no reduction for the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Colonization of the upper respiratory tract by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria is more prevalent. Pharmacological agents like antidepressants, antiparkinsonian medications, diuretics, antihypertensive agents and antihistamines were lead to decreased salivation and oropharyngeal gram-negative bacterial colonization (Clegg et al., 2013; Flaatten et al., 2017). Comorbidity is another important risk factor for this age group. Diabetes, chronic respiratory disorders, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, malignity are all increasing the likelihood of pneumonia (Chong and Street, 2008).",

In terms of economic impact, two studies carried out in the Netherlands and Japan, sustained remarkable results. The majority of CAP episodes (64%) occurred among patients 50 years and older and these episodes incurred 76% of the costs. The second study included 29,619 patients with CAP aged 65 years and over and reported median treatment costs of US$ 346 per outpatient CAP and US$ 4851 per hospitalized CAP (Klausen et al., 2012; Kothe et al., 2008).

The primary purpose of this score is to distinguish patients that could be safely treated in an outpatient setting versus inpatient observation and treatment. The major limitations of the PSI score are its focusing by age and comorbidity and not consider psychosocial variables, infrequent comorbidities, or patient preferences regarding treatment. The CURB-65 is a less complex scoring system only requires six variables to be evaluated at presentation (Table 7\n). (Lim et al., 2003). For severity assessment and hospitalization decision, the usefulness of these scores are presented in Table 8\n. In CURB-65, age is an extremely significant variable. These scores highlight that elderly patients with pneumonia are at risk for higher severe disease and poorer clinical outcome, but the limitations of the CURB-65 score that not contain data such as hypoxemia, electrolyte disturbance or the inability to take oral medications. For prediction ICU admission and the risk of death in patients with severe CAP, several other tools have also been designed. The examples include the PS-CURXO80, SMART-COP, and CAP-PIRO scores. All of these guidelines\u2014except one\u2014include age as one of the variables associated with poor outcomes. PS-CURXO80 uses age above 80 years old as one of the minor criterion for determining the severity of illness. The SMART-COP scoring system evaluates the need for respiratory and vasopressor support. In this score, age is not one of the severity markers but tachypnea and poor oxygenation are used as an adjustment tool. Rello and colleagues developed the CAP-PIRO score. This score evaluates predisposition, infection, response, and organ dysfunction variables (Espana et al., 2006; Charles et al., 2008; Rello et al., 2009). Detailed information for all of these scores is presented in Table 9\n.",

Risk factors for aspiration pneumonia are age, male gender, neurologic impairment, Parkinson\u2019s disease, lung disease, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, periodontal diseases, poor oral hygiene, vomiting, proven dysphagia, proton pump inhibitor, antipsychotic or sedative drug use. Diagnosing can be challenging, as a diagnostic tool, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) can be performed at the bedside. The most common pathogens are oropharyngeal flora including anaerobes, Gram-positive cocci, and Gram-negative bacilli. Antibiotics against indigenous oral flora including anaerobes should be administered and both swallowing rehabilitation and oral healthcare management should be initiated. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is often performed for preventing aspiration, but there is little evidence to indicate that it prevents pneumonia. A head-up position, by \u223c 30 degree and mosapride, a gastroprokinetic agent may be preventing gastroesophageal regurgitation and associated aspiration. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and cilostazol have been reported effective for prevention of pneumonia, because these medications increase substance P levels in the airways and plasma, improving both swallowing and cough reflexes. For prevention, also anticholinergic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, diuretics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that which cause dry mouth should be administered cautiously.",

Without risk factors for MDR organisms, empiric therapy should include one antibiotic (against P. aeruginosa, other gram-negative organisms, and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) Suggested agents include piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem.2.In patients with risk factors for MRSA infection, empiric coverage should include vancomycin or linezolid.3.HAP/VAP treatment should always include antipseudomonal coverage. Dual antipseudomonal agents from different classes are recommended for empiric therapy in patients with a risk factor for MDR gram-negative pathogens. Decisions about dual coverage should be individualized (Mandell et al., 2007).4.In most patients with HAP/VAP, the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 7 days, regardless of the isolated pathogen. There is no difference in regard to mortality, treatment failure, recurrent pneumonia, or duration of mechanical ventilation. A longer duration may be appropriate where the patient may have a delayed clinical response.5.The guidelines recommend that discontinuation of antibiotics be based on clinical criteria and procalcitonin testing (Schuetz et al., 2012).\n",

Antimicrobial selection for elderly patients with CAP does not differ from that of younger adults. In clinical practice guidelines, early antibiotic administration and strict adherence to the regimes is recommended. It is not appropriate to restrict intensive care and ventilatory support only on the basis of chronologic age. There is no difference for management the patients with HAP and VAP in this age group.
