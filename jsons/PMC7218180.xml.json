During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, health care workers accounted for 21% of victims worldwide, and 43% of SARS patients in Toronto were health care workers.1 This was likely multifactorial, including a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), unrecognized cases, and inadequate PPE used.1,2 This risk was greatest to nurses working in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care units.2 Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are interventions that can cause airborne infectious particles to be propelled into the air. Due to their small size and potential to be suspended in the air for prolonged periods, additional precautions are required for health care workers who are exposed to AGMPs.",

We recognize that pronouncement of death in an ambulance or ambulance bay is a considerable shift from normal practice for many emergency physicians. The justification of this procedure is to reduce the exposure of additional health care workers and other ill patients in the context of an expected resuscitation that is unlikely to be beneficial.

Registration of the patient to the ED, along with appropriate identification and tagging of the body, will allow for medical documentation surrounding termination of resuscitation and ensure proper identification of the patient. Specifically, we suggest that a hospital identification band be placed on the patient's arm before the body bag is closed in the ambulance bay, the bag should be clearly labeled with a sharpie with the name and date of birth and the bag should be disinfected or wiped down with anti-viral wipes or a bleach solution before transfer into the hospital.",
