Water supply, sanitation, food, and climate change are all environmental factors that influence the spread of these diseases [8] . Poor water and sanitation or contaminated food can contribute to diarrheal disease outbreaks, such as cholera, while climate change can affect the distribution and population of disease vectors; for example, flooding and standing water wetlands can cause malaria outbreaks [8] . Public health strategies focus on understanding how to control environmental drivers of infectious diseases, which contributes to disease prevention [7] . Because infectious disease traits and outcomes are so varied, the collaboration between health policy, access to healthcare, and the environment are important in order to determine how these efforts can best be aligned to make a difference in counteracting these diseases [7] . The interaction needed between these types of efforts alongside an understanding of the culture can create positive interventions and curb disease rates; however, if unheeded, adverse consequences can arise and contribute to disease transmission, as was the case with HIV/ AIDS in Western Kenya.",

            "text": "In Kenya, the most significant cause of death by broad group is HIV/ AIDS, malaria, and TB [9] . HIV/AIDS was the leading cause of death in Kenya in 2012, contributing to 54,400 deaths or 14.4% of all death country-wide [9] . Malaria caused 12,000 deaths (3.2%), while TB caused 9400 deaths (2.5%) [9] . Diarrheal diseases also contributed to 23,400 deaths (6.5%) in Kenya [9] . These mortality rates of infectious diseases in Kenya suggest that these types of diseases are of critical concern in the country. Unfortunately, in addition to these diseases, there are also many neglected tropical diseases. This list of diseases includes non-typhoidal salmonella, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, and trachoma [10, 11] . To put this into perspective, 29 million people in Kenya are at risk for lymphatic filariasis, and two million are at risk for trachoma [11] . There are also infectious diseases that are specifically waterborne and foodborne that occur in Kenya due to population displacement, crowding, poor access to safe water and sanitation, and unsafe food handling and preparation (e.g. unpasteurized milk) [12] . These diseases include cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and E, Entamoeba histolytica, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, and brucellosis [12] . Malaria is a priority vector-borne disease concern in Kenya, but there are also other vector-borne diseases dispersed throughout Kenya. These diseases often occur from standing water or unprotected water containers, overcrowding, inadequate shelter, and significant climatic and temperature variation [12] . This list of diseases in Kenya includes Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, plague, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, human African trypanosomiasis, relapsing fever, and Marburg hemorrhagic fever [12] . Finally, there are certain infectious diseases that occur specifically from overcrowding-hygiene and sanitation-which frequently happen in refugee camps or slums. Diseases of overcrowding and subsequent inadequate shelter in Kenya include measles, ARI, diphtheria, meningococcal disease, pertussis, and TB [12] .",

The only light came from the motorcycle headlights in front of us and our only trail disappeared as soon as the dust settled.

Disco funerals are held up to three times a week and a single event may be celebrated up to a week long [20] . Community members attend because they are a cheap form of entertainment and an opportunity to meet the other sex; unfortunately, casual, forced, and transactional sex are often facilitated by the intense atmosphere at the funerals [20] . I experienced how and why these rapes may occur. The attending men are generally intoxicated, high from marijuana or miraa, and typically exude aggressive behavior. It was explained to me by the members of my group that children as young as 8 years old get raped at these events. Based on the parlous state of the environment, I was able to see how this situation could arise. According to current literature, a successful intervention addressing wife inheritance and disco funeral events, including the rapes, risky sexual behavior, and the spread of HIV/ AIDS, does not exist [22, 23] . This cultural event in Kenya shows how the transmission of one of the most significant infectious diseases in the world can and does occur.",

There are 3.2 billion people living in 106 countries that have high risk to malaria exposure [29] . [33] . But, progress has been made: HIV is no longer on the top ten causes of deaths in the world [4] . The primary way to reduce the spread of HIV is for infected individuals to take antiretroviral therapy (ART), which slows the progression of the disease and helps protect the immune system. Current prevention efforts besides ART availability and adherence include education, contraceptive dispersal (e.g. condoms), and HIV testing and counseling [34]. \u2022 Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top ten causes of death in the world [4] . The disease is caused by bacteria that generally attack the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body (e.g. kidney, spine, brain) [35, 36] . There are two types of conditions: latent TB and TB. It is only the development of the latter that can contribute to the contagious disease, as people with latent TB cannot spread the disease. TB is an ancient disease in which sanatoriums were historically used to quarantine infected individuals in hopes of halting the spread and curing the person [37] . However, despite the progress made against infectious diseases, socioeconomic, environmental, and ecological factors are contributing to new microbial pathogens and the emergence of new infectious diseases [39] . Emerging infectious diseases are infectious diseases that are newly appearing or have existed, but are increasing geographically [40] . Population growth, urbanization and overcrowding in cities, unsanitary food preparation, ecological changes, and changing social behaviors are some direct factors contributing to the increased incidence rates of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases [41] . These diseases happen in different origins. Some emerging infections are caused by microbes in nonhuman vertebrates, such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which originates in deer mice, and HIV and SARS, which are from primates [41] . Other diseases are re-emergent microbes were historically controlled in selected regions of the world. The dengue virus of 1903 was eliminated in Central and South America, but was located in Southeast Asia 50 years later as dengue hemorrhagic fever; however, because eradication programs had ended in Central and South America, the disease eventually became reintroduced [41] . Lastly, drug-resistant pathogens can also become threatening emerging infectious diseases. Chloroquine was effective in preventing malaria, but due to the resistance of the mosquito to the medication, malaria has resurged as a global threat [41] . Again, strategies for preventing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are collaborative efforts between state, local, government, academic, non-profit, and research agencies that improve surveillance and response, research, infrastructure, training, and control [42] .",

Additionally, these sites should have food safety programs that encourage standards, inspection plans, and regulations regarding food and milk preparation, handling, and distribution, which can help populations evade contaminated food diseases [7] . \u2022 Management of malnutrition. Malnourished individuals can have weakened immune systems and significantly suffer from bacterial infections that may have otherwise been cleared. Breastfeeding in babies should be encouraged to avoid diseases associated with food or water contamination [6] . Adequate nutrition should also be maintained in child and adult populations. \u2022 Case management. Early and appropriate treatment ensures effective diagnoses and treatment of diseases and inhibits the spread of the disease [7] . \u2022 Surveillance warning and response systems. These early warning symptoms can promptly detect outbreaks and ensure rapid control. Effective procedures can include outbreak response, investigation kits and supplies, surveillance structures, laboratories for rapid diagnosis and confirmation of disease threats, and active communication response between key public health actors [6] . \u2022 Immunizations. Vaccinations are not only important for individual health, but public health as well [7] . A proportion of the population that is vaccinated ensures that a disease-causing pathogen will be unable to reproduce itself at high enough levels to maintain itself in the population [7] . Once the infected host is cured or dies, there will not be enough susceptible hosts to supplement the pathogens, thus eliminating further spread of the disease [7] . \u2022 Vector and animal control and personal protection. Both animals and vectors are carriers of many diseases that affect humans. Inspecting domestic animals can eliminate the threat of pathogens from milk or meat [7] . Vector-borne diseases can be controlled by eliminating breeding grounds or stagnant water in containers and by using pesticides and bed nets [6, 7] . \u2022 Health education. Education can help relay messages to the public in order to avoid infectious diseases. Some messages can include using safe water, avoiding mosquito bites, having safe sex or no sex, promoting proper hygiene, covering one's mouth when coughing, having good hygiene practices, eating safe food, and getting treatment early if necessary [6] .",
