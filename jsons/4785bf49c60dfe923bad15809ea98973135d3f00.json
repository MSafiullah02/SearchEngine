It is defined as follows: Take any language L over some k-letter alphabet and consider the set called the figure of L in [8] , which consists of all elements of N k corresponding to Parikh vectors of prefixes of words from L. The geometrical closure of L is the language \u03b3(L) of all words w such that the Parikh vectors of all the prefixes of w lie in the figure of L. This closure operator was inspired by the previous works of Blanpain, Champarnaud, and Dubernard [4] and B\u00e9al et al. [3] , in which geometrical languages are studied -using the terminology from later paper [8] , these can be described as languages whose prefix closure is equal to their geometrical closure. Note that this terminology was motivated by the fact that a geometrical language is completely determined by its (geometrical) figure. In the particular case of binary alphabets, these (geometrical) figures were illustrated by plane diagrams in [8] .",

One possible research aim could be to characterise regular languages L for which \u03b3(L) is regular, or to describe some robust classes of languages with this property. Another problem posed in [8] is to find some subclasses of regular languages that are geometrically closed. As we explain in Sect. 3, non-empty group languages have their geometrical closure equal to the universal language \u03a3 * . For this reason, it makes sense to look for more interesting geometrically closed subclasses among star-free languages, which are known to be \"group-free\". More precisely, a language L is star-free if and only if the syntactic monoid M L of L is aperiodic, that is, if M L does not contain non-trivial groups as subsemigroups.",

In particular, the variety V 1 (i.e., the variety of languages of level 1) is formed by piecewise testable languages and the positive variety V 3/2 is formed by polynomials built from languages of level 1. We refer to the survey paper by Pin [12] for an introduction to the Straubing-Th\u00e9rien hierarchy of star-free languages and the algebraic theory of regular languages in general. This theory is based on Eilenberg correspondence between varieties of regular languages and pseudovarieties of finite monoids. Note that one well-known instance of Eilenberg correspondence, which plays an essential role in our contribution, is given by the pseudovariety of finite R-trivial monoids, for which the corresponding variety of languages is denoted by R. Nevertheless, we emphasise that our contribution is rather elementary, and it does not use sophisticated tools developed in the algebraic theory of regular languages.",

In other words, we do not construct a concrete regular expression for \u03b3(L), but we determine what kind of expression exists for such a language. In particular, we introduce a new variety of languages R LT , which is a subvariety of the variety R. Note that there is a transparent description of languages from R and also an effective characterisation via the so-called acyclic automata (both are recalled in Sect. 4). The variety of languages R LT is then characterised in the same manner: a precise description by specific regular expressions and also an automata-based characterisation are given. The letters LT in the notation R LT refer to a characteristic property of acyclic automata in which \"loops are transferred\" along paths.",

A class of languages C is an operator, which determines, for each finite non-empty alphabet \u03a3, a set C(\u03a3 * ) of languages over \u03a3. A positive variety is a class of regular languages V such that V(\u03a3 * ) is closed under quotients, finite unions and intersections, and the whole class is closed under preimages in homomorphisms. A positive variety V is a variety if each V(\u03a3 * ) is closed under complementation.

            "text": "The previous two lemmas show that every language from R LT is recognised by an LT-acyclic automaton. The following lemma strengthens this observation by implying that the minimal automaton of a language from R LT is LT-acyclic. Proof. Let A = (Q, \u03a3, \u00b7, \u03b9, F ) be an LT-acyclic automaton such that A = L. The minimal automaton D L is a homomorphic image of some subautomaton of A [14] . It is clear that a subautomaton of an LT-acyclic automaton is LT-acyclic. Thus we may assume that A has all states reachable from the initial state \u03b9. Let \u03d5 : Q \u2192 P be a surjective mapping, which is a homomorphism from the automaton A onto an automaton B = (P, \u03a3, \u2022, \u03d5(\u03b9), \u03d5(F )). We claim that B is acyclic. To prove this claim, let p \u2208 P and w \u2208 \u03a3 * be such that p\u2022w = p. Then we choose some state q from \u03d5 \u22121 (p). For that q , we have q \u00b7 w m \u2208 \u03d5 \u22121 (p) for every natural number m. Since the sequence q , q \u00b7 w, q \u00b7 w 2 , . . . contains only finitely many states, there are natural numbers n and m such that q \u00b7w n+m = q \u00b7w n = q. Since A is acyclic, we have q\u00b7a = q for every letter a occurring in w. Consequently, p \u2022 a = \u03d5(q) \u2022 a = \u03d5(q \u00b7 a) = \u03d5(q) = p. We showed that B is acyclic. Now let p \u2208 P and a \u2208 \u03a3 be such that p \u2022 a = p. It follows from the previous paragraph that there is q \u2208 \u03d5 \u22121 (p) such that q \u00b7 a = q. Since A is LT-acyclic, we see that (q \u00b7 b) \u00b7 a = q \u00b7 b for every b \u2208 \u03a3. Thus p \u2022 ba = \u03d5(q \u00b7 ba) = \u03d5(q \u00b7 b) = p \u2022 b. We showed that B is an LT-acyclic automaton. In particular, it is true for D L .",

Therefore, p \u00b7 ba = p \u00b7 b. So, we see that there is a loop labelled by a in the state p \u00b7 b. We proved that D L is an LT-acyclic automaton and L belongs to R LT (\u03a3 * ) by Theorem 9.",

Now, simply saying, we claim that the language pref \u2193 (L) is recognised by the automaton A constructed from A by replacing all non-final states with a single absorbing non-final state \u03c4 . More precisely, we construct an automaton A = (F \u222a {\u03c4 }, \u03a3, \u2022, \u03b9, F ), where \u03c4 is a new state, for which we define \u03c4 \u2022 a = \u03c4 for each a \u2208 \u03a3. Furthermore, for each p \u2208 F and a \u2208 \u03a3, we put p \u2022 a = p \u00b7 a if p \u00b7 a \u2208 F , and p \u2022 a = \u03c4 otherwise. As A contains no cycle other than a loop, the constructed automaton A has the same property. Moreover, any state of A reachable in A from some p in F \u222a {\u03c4 } is either reachable from p in A, or equal to \u03c4 . As \u03c4 \u2022 c = \u03c4 for each c in \u03a3, this implies that A is an LT-acyclic automaton and pref \u2193 (L) belongs to R LT (\u03a3 * ) by Theorem 9.",

(ii) M L satisfies the pseudoidentities (xy) \u03c9 x = (xy) \u03c9 and x \u03c9 yx = x \u03c9 y. (iii) M L satisfies the pseudoidentity (xy) \u03c9 zx = (xy) \u03c9 z.Proof. Let D L = (Q, \u03a3, \u00b7, \u03b9, F ) be the minimal automaton of the language L. Then M L can be viewed as the transition monoid of D L (see[12, p. 692]). Elements of M L are thus transitions of D L determined by words from \u03a3 * . More formally, for u \u2208 \u03a3 * , we denote by f u the transition given by the rule p \u2192 p \u00b7 u for each p \u2208 Q.
