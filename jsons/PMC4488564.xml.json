The use of herbal concoctions for medicinal purposes dates back at least to several millennia bc from the records of ancient Egyptian, Chinese, Babylonian, Greek, and Roman cultures.1 To date < 2% of botanical resources have been exploited for bioactive molecules. These have resulted in nearly 25% of all prescription medicines, which underscores the vital importance of investigating thoroughly the plant kingdom for potential treatment modalities. Nature is the first, and for millions of people, the only source for medicines. According to reports of the World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of the world population depends on herbal medicine for primary health care.2 In spite of scientific progress in organic synthesis and biochemistry over the past century, current medicine still relies primarily on drugs isolated from plants, fungi, marine botanicals, molds, etc. to save countless human and animal lives. Although some of these molecules have served as templates for semisynthetic congeners currently in clinical use, what nature designed often cannot be easily duplicated.",

In some arid regions of southwestern USA, the plant not only thrives as the most dominant vegetation but has also genetically adapted as evidenced by genotypes that vary according to regions. The plant grows in all desert regions, but only the species that grow in South America and in North America's largest desert (the Chihuahuan) carries two sets of chromosomes in each cell nucleus. In the Sonoran desert, where winters are mild and rains fall during both the summer and winter, the plant has four sets of chromosomes. By contrast, in the Mojave desert, the smallest and driest desert of the USA, where summers are very long and hot, the plant is hexaploid.7,8 Whether the chromosomal variations are in response to the climate of the region or correlate with the quantity and diversity of the production of secondary metabolites is unknown. There is considerable pharmacologic interest in these metabolites, which the plant appears to use for defense.",

Likewise, the dimethoxy and trimethoxy derivatives are oily and active. These activities were also observed with O-methylated cyclolignans isolated from the same plant extract. Unlike NDGA, all these compounds were effective at inhibiting HIV replication in cell cultures (laboratory strains as well as primary isolates from AIDS patients).21 The cyclolignans 3\u2032-demethoxyisoguaiacin and norisoguaiacin (Fig. 2B), also isolated from creosote bush, were significantly more active than all NDGA derivatives including Mal-4.15 However, these compounds occur in much smaller amounts in the extract compared to NDGA and its analogs. Full synthetic methylation of NDGA yielded the tetramethylated derivative terameprocol (M4N; Fig. 3B), which has advanced to clinical trials as an anticancer agent.22 M4N is an amorphous powder that naturally occurs in the plant, but in much lower concentration than NDGA and many NDGA derivatives.",

HIV contains three Sp1 motifs, which directly and indirectly interact with the HIV Tat protein to exponentially increase the virus gene transcription and replication. The creosote bush lignans have structural determinants that bind to DNA sequences rich in cytosine/guanine (C/G) boxes and Sp1 is likely to be a primary target for these compounds. The blockade of this sequence by the plant molecules (for instance M4N) prevents Sp1 factors from binding to their cognate site at HIV LTR promoter level. As a result, the virus replication is abrogated. Thus, these lignans are able specifically to inhibit HIV basal gene transcription as well as HIV Tat-regulated gene trans-activation.21",

The semipurified extract (called Me-1) was analyzed using countercurrent chromatography (CCC), and a reference fingerprint chromatogram of the extract was established. Thin-layer chromatography analysis enabled the identification of all the peaks of anti-HIV active lignans in two pools (Gr and Lo), which were individually resolved based on the separation conditions of our previous study.15 (An example of the purification of Lo fraction is illustrated in Fig. 4B.) The cocktail of Me-1 was generated by gathering all the compounds resulting from the separation studies, and after their chemical characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 2, Me-1 consists mostly of three classes of compounds: (1) the 11 dibenzylbutane lignans (without NDGA but including M4N and Mal-4); (2) the five very active cyclolignans; and (3) several flavonoids including quercetin, luteolin, and methylated flavonoids such as ayanin, devoid of anti-HIV activity, were included into the formulation for their anticancer effects.",

All these compounds should work synergistically as they compete for various targets inside the cells and viruses. It is our view that for a robust and effective treatment of complex diseases such as cancer, a combination of small organic molecules is required, and these molecules must fulfill three major criteria: (1) they must be relatively safe, sparing normal cells and reversing multidrug resistance phenotype of cancer cells; (2) they must have multi-ligand capability, i.e., each molecule in the cocktail must act on multiple biomolecular targets; and, finally, (3) they must be capable of reversing tumorigenesis by inhibiting oncogenes or restoring the tumor suppressor genes such as the p53 family of tumor suppressor proteins. It is our hypothesis that Me-1 formulation meets all these requirements, and thus should be a complement to current chemotherapy, or a valid alternative to cancer treatment.",

The bioassays showed that the cocktail was significantly more active than each major NDGA derivative (M4N, Mal-4), when tested against various cancer cell lines (data not shown). This activity was even greater by several hundred-fold in in vivo studies. These results were corroborated by other investigators who demonstrated that organic extracts of the creosote bush exhibited greater activity than individual compounds including NDGA and the cancer drug paclitaxel when tested against breast cancer cell lines (MCF7).52 These preliminary results lend validity to our view that the Me-1 strategy may lead to a safer and more effective anticancer and antiviral cocktail. This formulation may be a bridge between Eastern herbal-based medicines and Western single synthetic molecule-based chemotherapy.

The few vaccines available against some of these viruses need to be updated every year, and never reach the majority of people in developing nations. Antibiotics are designed to reach and stop the replication of bacteria without crippling the vital cellular genetic machinery. By contrast, most viruses have the ability to hijack the cell genetic machinery inside the nucleus in order to replicate. This explains why antibiotics are often ineffective against many viral infections such as the flu, cold virus, and many others. The creosote bush lignans possess the ability to act at the cellular level and permeate the nucleus and the virus envelope to block the viral gene machinery.21 They are capable of suppressing viruses that contain Sp1 or are rich in C/G boxes in their gene transcriptional machinery such as HSV, varicella zoster virus, blindness-causing cytomegalovirus, HIV, and HPV. Since Sp1 and C/G motifs are common features in many virus families and are highly conserved (nonmutable), this class of plant lignans could represent a breakthrough for viral treatment as penicillin became for bacteria since World War II.",
