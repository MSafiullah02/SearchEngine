            "text": "Secretor status is highly associated with infection and disease caused by many HuNoV strains based upon findings from human experimental infection studies and evaluation of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks (10\u201314). Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) is an enzyme expressed in human epithelial cells that catalyzes \u03b11,2-fucosylation of the terminal galactose, preferentially on glycan type 1 chain precursors. Glycosyltransferases coded for by FUT2 along with FUT3 and ABO genes determine the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) found on the epithelial cell surface (15, 16). Persons who lack functional FUT2 alleles do not express ABH HBGAs on epithelial cells, are designated nonsecretors, and are highly resistant to gastroenteritis caused by some HuNoV strains such as GII.4 viruses. Similarly, HIEs derived from nonsecretor individuals are not susceptible to GII.4 HuNoV infection (2). HIEs and gastrointestinal epithelial cells of secretor-positive individuals also bind norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) (17, 21). However, while HIEs from secretors are permissive to HuNoV replication, FUT2 expression in conventional cancer-derived cell lines is not sufficient to make cells susceptible to HuNoV replication, suggesting that HBGAs function primarily as an initial attachment factor (18, 19). These data also lead to questions on whether there are additional genetically determined differences in HuNoV susceptibility in addition to secretor status. In this study, we evaluated the direct association between FUT2 function and HuNoV infectivity using HIEs with or without FUT2 expression in the same genetic background.",

We determined the FUT2 (Se) and FUT3 (Le) genotypes of jejunal HIE lines and selected two lines (J2 and J4); both lines express FUT3, eliminating Lewis status as a variable in these studies (Table 1). The J2 cell line is heterozygous wild type (Se/se428 [J2Fut2+/\u2212]); because the Se gene is autosomal dominant, the cells are secretor positive. The J4 line has a homozygous se428/se428 (J4Fut2\u2212/\u2212) recessive mutation and is secretor negative (20). No other mutations associated with loss of or decreased FUT2 enzymatic function were observed in the J2 or J4 line. To better understand the importance of FUT2 in HuNoV infection, we generated isogenic knockout (KO) and knock-in (KI) HIE lines. A lentivirus-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 construct with a guide RNA targeting the FUT2 coding region was used to knock out FUT2 from J2 (J2Fut2\u2212/\u2212). Single cell selection under puromycin pressure was used to isolate a clonal population, and deletions of the gene in both alleles were confirmed by sequencing. To generate the KI FUT2 line, we transduced a functional FUT2 coding sequence driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in a lentivirus into J4 (J4Fut2\u2212/\u2212/FUT2) cells.",

Both J2Fut2+/\u2212 and J4Fut2\u2212/\u2212/FUT2 cells had apical staining of UEA-1 lectin. This apical staining was lost in J2Fut2\u2212/\u2212 and J4Fut2\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 2A). These findings indicate that, as expected, terminal fucosylation of the glycan precursor in HIEs depends on the expression of the FUT2 gene. In the secretor-negative lines, unexpected internal cellular UEA-1 staining was present that was not observed in the secretor-positive lines. To confirm that the internal staining was due to specific UEA-1 recognition of \u03b11,2-fucose and not off-target binding due to loss of the specific ligand, we preincubated the UEA-1 lectin with l-fucose prior to staining. When UEA-1 was preincubated with 10 mM l-fucose, staining was not detected in the secretor-negative lines and was significantly reduced in the secretor-positive lines (Fig. 2B). After preincubation with 100 mM l-fucose, UEA-1 staining was not detected in either the secretor-negative or secretor-positive lines (Fig. 2C). Together, these data indicate that the apical and the internal staining observed with UEA-1 is due to specific interaction with \u03b11,2-fucose.

J4Fut2\u2212/\u2212/FUT2 was permissive to infection by all four viruses, based upon increases in viral genome equivalents (GEs) at 24 hpi. Interestingly, although GE levels at 1 to 2 hpi were similar, we observed greater increases in GEs for GII.17 and GI.1 HuNoVs in J4Fut2\u2212/\u2212/FUT2 cells than in J2Fut2+/\u2212 cells at 24 hpi. This suggests that additional factors that vary between individual HIE lines, aside from secretor status, may influence the replication of these two strains. Taken together, these results show that functional FUT2 is sufficient and critical for replication of multiple HuNoV strains and that GII.3 is capable of infection in some secretor-negative HIE lines.",

It is likely that initial binding of secretor-dependent HuNoVs to HIEs is regulated by fucosylation, with the attachment factors being fucosylated. However, it is unclear whether the fucosylated molecules serve only as the initial attachment factor that then facilitates interaction with a virus-specific receptor or whether the fucosylated molecules function as a virus receptor themselves; examples of both mechanisms have been described previously with nonfucosylated glycans (22). For example, reovirus binding to its proteinaceous JAM-A receptor is enhanced by initial binding to sialic acid residues (23), while human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 bind to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid receptors (24) and influenza viruses bind to terminal sialic acid receptors (25). If fucosylated molecules serve only as attachment factors, then the virus receptor(s) for secretor-dependent HuNoVs is present in both secretor-positive and secretor-negative HIEs and is not expressed in other nonsusceptible, secretor-positive cancer-derived or transformed cell lines. On the other hand, if the fucosylated molecules function as the virus receptor, it is unclear why secretor-positive cultured transformed cells derived from cancer patients are not susceptible to infection. It is possible that transformed lines do not properly express the needed receptors or glycans or other signaling pathways essential for infection. Transformation may abrogate proper glycosylation in nonsusceptible cell lines compared to nontransformed HIE lines (26).",

UEA-1 detection of \u03b11,2-fucose was observed exclusively at the apical surface in FUT2-positive cells. Unexpectedly, in the secretor-negative lines, there was internal cellular staining by UEA-1. The staining was due to UEA-1-specific interactions with \u03b11,2-fucose, indicating that these glycan structures are present but unable to transit to the surfaces of the secretor-negative HIE cultures. There is evidence that FUT2 expression leads to surface expression of \u03b11,2-fucosylated molecules. This was shown in specific-pathogen-free mice, where the lumen of the small intestine is mostly lacking in surface fucosylation, and intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates expression of \u03b11,2-fucosylated molecules at the surface in a FUT2-dependent manner (27, 28). There may be additional fucosyltransferase enzymes present in our HIEs capable of adding fucose to glycoproteins or glycolipids in the absence of FUT2 activity. However, these alternatively fucosylated molecules are unable to transit to the cell surface. Fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1), expressed in erythroid cells and some other tissues, is also capable of adding \u03b11,2-fucose, although preferentially on glycan chains other than those found in intestinal epithelia. In the parental J2 enteroid line used in this study, FUT1 transcripts are expressed by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), and the fragment per kilobase per million (FPKM) value is \u223c60-fold lower than that of FUT2. In bovine coronary venular endothelial cells, a lotus lectin (LTL) that also recognizes \u03b11,2-fucosylated molecules detects cytoplasmic tubule structures, and this staining is lost after depletion of both FUT1 and FUT2 (29). Further studies showed that LTL costained with a Golgi marker in newly derived primary human fibroblasts from oral mucosa, but this Golgi colocalization was lost and LTL was instead detected in tubule structures as the fibroblasts were passaged. In our system, the presence of some FUT1 expression may allow for \u03b11,2-fucose-containing structures intracellularly. Future studies will determine the identity and subcellular location of the fucosylated molecules present in the FUT2-negative HIE lines and whether FUT1 is required for their presence.",

The exact role played by the glycans in these infections is not fully understood.
