Each tube is periodically checked for the presence of replicating virus by hemadsorption (HA) for influenza and parainfluenza viruses, and by microscopy for cytopathic effect (CPE) for the other viruses. Once HA or CPE has been detected, the presence of the suspected viruses is confirmed by staining the cells by immunofluorescence.",

NAAT are more sensitive than viral culture and can be performed in a few days or less, depending on the workflow. All of these tests have reasonable specificity when they are correctly performed. Nevertheless, the modern methods of viral culture for respiratory viruses described in this article will continue to be a good choice for many laboratories. The advantages of viral culture are first, that it is more sensitive than immunoassays for most respiratory viruses, and second, that it is far simpler and cheaper than NAAT. Until NAAT become easier to perform, probably through automation, and less expensive, viral culture for respiratory viruses will continue to be useful.",

MDCK cells have been genetically modified to express higher levels of the molecule bound by the viral hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins present on the surface of influenza virus strains adapted to growth in human hosts. Influenza viruses bind to host cells through the binding of viral hemagglutinin protein to sialyloligosaccharides on the host-cell surface.2 After replication, exit of influenza virus from the host cell depends on cleavage of sialic acid from the saccharides on the host cell. The structure of the sialyloligosaccharides differs between different animal species, and the influenza viruses that grow in a given host species preferentially bind and cleave the specific sialyloligosaccharides found in that species. Most of the terminal N-acetyl sialic acid residues on human respiratory epithelial cells are bound to the saccharide in an \u03b12,6-linkage (called NeuAc\u03b12,6Gal), and so influenza viruses from humans would be expected to replicate well in cells with surface NeuAc\u03b12,6Gal.2 While MDCK cells do have NeuAc\u03b12,6Gal on their surface, they also have a second type of cell-surface sialic acid (NeuAc\u03b12,3Gal).3 By increasing the level of NeuAc\u03b12,6Gal and decreasing the level of NeuAc\u03b12,3Gal present on the surface of MDCK cells, one might be able to make MDCK cells better able to support replication of influenza viruses from human infections.",

During the winters of 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 many isolates of influenza A (H1N1) were resistant to oseltamivir.4 Cell lines used for influenza virus culture, including MDCK cells, do not give accurate results in functional assays for oseltamivir resistance, probably because expression of low levels of NeuAc\u03b12,6Gal lead to apparent oseltamivir insensitivity even when the virus is susceptible to the drug.3 Unlike MDCK cells, MDCK-SIAT1 cells allow ready detection of oseltamivir resistance in a bioassay.3 Matrosovich and colleagues used two wild-type oseltamivir susceptible influenza A strains and their corresponding oseltamivir resistant mutants in a bioassay with MDCK-SIAT1 cells and found that the resistant mutants demonstrated 100-fold, or greater, resistance to oseltamivir.3 Hatakeyama and colleagues tested a larger number of influenza virus isolates (six H3N2, six H1N1 and five influenza B) in a bioassay for oseltamivir susceptibility with independently generated MDCK engineered to express increased levels of NeuAc\u03b12,6Gal (which they called ST6Gal I cells).5 They found that reduction of plaque size by 50% in greater than 90% of plaques, rather than plaque number, accurately reflected the susceptibility of the viruses to oseltamivir. The gold standard for oseltamivir susceptibility in this study was an in vitro assay for the concentration of oseltamivir which inhibited 50% of the sialidase activity of neuraminidase. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that MDCK-SIAT1 is a good bioassay for oseltamivir susceptibility in influenza A and B viruses.",

Typically, these are designed to detect influenza A and B viruses, RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses (types 1, 2, and 3). To be adequately sensitive for each of these viruses, two cell lines are used. Most cell types will support proliferation of each of the viruses to differing degrees, but in general the shell-vial cultures include a cell line that supports replication of RSV and adenovirus (eg, HEp-2, A549) and another cell line to support replication of influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus (eg, PMK, MDCK). Separate shell vials are usually used for each cell type, but one commercial product combines multiple cell lines in a single shell vial (see later discussion). The number of shell vials of each type inoculated will depend on the number of time points on which vials are harvested for staining by immunofluorescence (usually one or two time points), and the staining strategy, as discussed next.",

First, the cells can be scraped off the cover slip, spotted in multiple wells of a slide, and then dried and fixed. Next, one well can be stained by immunofluorescence for each of the viruses separately, for a total of approximately seven stains. Alternatively, the cells can be stained for immunofluorescence using a pool of antibodies against all the viruses to be detected. If a pooled reagent with a single fluorochrome is used, negative results are obtained directly from the results of the pooled stain. If the pooled stain is positive, however, then individual stains must be done for each of the individual viruses included in the pool. There are now commercial reagents that are a pool of antibodies in which one antibody has a different fluorochrome than all the other antibodies. Millipore markets SimulFluor Pooled DFA reagent, which differentiates RSV from other viruses in the pool, and Diagnostic Hybrids markets the D3 Duet Respiratory Virus Screening Kits, which have differential staining for either influenza A or RSV in pooled reagents. This differentiation allows the specimens positive for the virus with the unique fluorochrome to be reported directly from the results of the pooled stain. Staining with pooled immunofluorescent reagents can result in a savings in labor, although this will depend on which viruses are present in the specimens a laboratory tests and the fraction of specimens that are negative for those viruses.",

Incubation of the MDCK for an additional 24 hours (48 hours total) more than doubled the number of influenza B-positive specimens detected, but this only raised the sensitivity to approximately half that of conventional tube culture.18 The addition of HEp-2 cells increased the sensitivity for RSV from 82.6% to 100%, and also increased detection of parainfluenza viruses and adenoviruses, although only small numbers of these were detected in the study.18\n",

The time to detection of viruses is shorter with R-Mix than with conventional culture. LaSala and colleagues found that the mean time to detection of influenza virus was 1.1 days and 4.3 days for R-Mix and conventional culture, respectively.23 For RSV, these authors found that the mean time to detection was 1.6 days and 10.2 days for R-Mix and conventional culture, respectively. The time to issue a negative report for R-Mix viral culture will depend on the days on which the shell vials are stained. Practice varies between the published studies, but in most studies the shell vial culture was complete within 3 days,23, 26 but some do hold them as long as 5 to 10 days.24, 25 In our laboratory, we stain R-Mix shell vials at 24 and 48 hours, allowing a maximum turn-around time of 2 days. Cryopreserved R-Mix shell vials with a shelf life of up to 6 months are also available. These shell vials have been validated in one study (see Table 2).27 They are reported to have a high sensitivity for influenza viruses, RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses when analyzed on day 3.",

They can be used in an accurate bioassay for the response of influenza isolates to neuraminidase inhibitors, and also show promise for use in detection of influenza viruses from clinical specimens. HuH7 cells are another promising cell line for use in viral culture for respiratory viruses, although definitive data supporting the use of these is needed. Shell-vial culture is a sensitive method for detection of respiratory viruses. An important advantage of shell-vial culture is the markedly reduced turn-around time for the culture. While shell vials containing a single cell line can be used to detect respiratory viruses, the total number of shell vials needed, and the labor of the culture, can be reduced using commercial R-Mix shell vials, which have a combination of two cell lines. This combination allows a single type of shell vial to be used for respiratory virus culture.",
