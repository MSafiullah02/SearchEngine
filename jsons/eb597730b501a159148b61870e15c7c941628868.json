Methods: A sample of patients of all ages presenting with ILI was included by physicians of the French Sentinelles network during two seasons (2015/16 and 2016/17). Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for the presence of influenza virus (IV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Patients' characteristics associated with each of the four virus classes were studied using multivariate logistic regressions. Results: A total of 5859 individuals were included in the study: 48.0% tested positive for IV, 7.9% for HRV, 7.5% for RSV and 4.1% for HMPV. Cough was associated with IV (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.81e2.52) RSV (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.75e3.74) and HMPV detection (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.40e3.45). Rhinorrhoea was associated mainly with HRV detection (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.34e2.32). Headache was associated with IV detection (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.34e2.32), whereas absence of headache was associated with RSV and HMPV detection. Dyspnoea was associated with RSV detection (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.73e3.12) and absence of dyspnoea with IV detection. Conjunctivitis was associated with IV detection (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08e1.50). Some associations were observed only in children: dyspnoea and cough with RSV detection (age <5 years), conjunctivitis with IV detection (age <15 years).

However, their intensity of circulation varied over the months, consistent with previous studies [4,10e12] : HRV circulated mostly during autumn and could reappear in spring, RSV had higher activity in late autumn to early winter, IV predominated mainly during winter. As expected, we showed that the risk of IV detection was higher during the influenza epidemic period, which supports the use of this S-ILI definition and the influenza epidemic detection method [13] . However, the proportion of S-ILI patients positive for IV was 48.0% over the study period and never higher than 76.0% by week (Fig. 1) . Laboratory confirmation of virus infection by RT-PCR is costly and is not feasible in real time at the physician's office.
