Despite intensive therapy he died on the 13 March after being transferred to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. On 5 March, seven health care workers who had cared for the index case also became ill (high fever, myalgia, headache and less often sore throat).

Despite the fact that such approaches have been found to be effective in relieving pain in almost 90% of patients, up to half of physicians do not make use of the guidelines. The most appropriate treatment of cancer pain is the use of non\u2010opioid analgesics such as paracetamol for mild pain, a weak opioid such as tramadol for moderate pain, and a strong opioid such as morphine for severe pain. At each step, it may be appropriate to add an adjuvant\u2010a drug that has a primary indication other than pain but is used to enhance analgesia in specific circumstances or to treat pain that is unresponsive to conventional analgesics \u2013 such as an antidepressant.",

Poor levels of communication not only exist between patients and physicians but among healthcare professionals, where there is still insufficient communication between physicians, in particular consultants to primary care physicians and this contributes to poor continuity of care. The research for this report has found that there are still few professionals involved in dedicated cancer pain management teams. Governments and health authorities have a major part to play in making cancer pain management a priority and promoting the development of multidisciplinary cancer teams. The benefits of such a team is evident where they have been rolled out for terminally ill patients \u2013 with the patient referred to one palliative care specialist who takes responsibility for stabilizing the pain, setting up a treatment regimen, and informing the primary care physician about appropriate treatment in the outpatient setting.",
