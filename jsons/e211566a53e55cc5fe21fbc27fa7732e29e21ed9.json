While most IT managers today have their hands full securing wired networks, their companies have been spending billions of dollars on wireless. Businesses will have spent $60 billion on wireless communications services and wireless network security by the end of 2006; and, 80 percent of the U.S. work force will use some sort of wireless device, including cell phones, pagers and mobile computing devices. That's good news for employee productivity, but bad news for companies ill-prepared to head off wireless network security breaches and debilitating viruses [10] .",

This is a very relevant form of IDS that is just starting to be developed. Now, developers can write around firewalls and keep their applications in use, because they've become a lot smarter For example, if you are running in a firewall environment, and the firewall administrator doesn't want you to run AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), he or she doesn't permit the service to happen. If you turn on Secure Socket Layer (SSL) now, all of a sudden you can run AIM and the firewall administrator can't do anything about it.

Based on the scanning strategy, you should be able to differentiate between attacks that deploy random scanning, hitlist scanning, topological scanning, permutation scanning and local subnet scanning. Thus, by gaining a larger agent population, attackers usually combine the scanning and exploitation phases. Here, the description of scanning techniques relates to this model [2] .",

The user of an 802.11 wireless client system (rather than the client system itself) requests access to an AP. The AP passes the request to a centralized authentication server that handles the authentication exchange and, if successful, provides an encryption key to the AP. The AP uses the key to securely transmit a unicast session or multicast/global encryption key to the client.

Current 802.11 b (also referred to as Wi-Fi) APs have a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 11 Mbps [3] , which must be shared by all clients accessing the AP. Depending on its volume, multicasting traffic can reduce the AP's available bandwidth significantly. In addition, if WEP encryption is used to secure the wireless network, a separate key must be configured on each client to support multicasting (in addition to the key required for unicast traffic). Furthermore, current VPN solutions only support multicast by unicasting the data stream individually to each wireless VPN client.
