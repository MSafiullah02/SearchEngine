            "text": "In this paper, we consider the SIR model that was introduced in 1927 by A.G. McKendrick and W.O. Kermack  [5]. The model is simple and has been widely used so far, for instance, in multigroup epidemic modeling  [6], online social network dynamics  [7], the model adopting the delay term  [8], stochastic model  [6], [9], [10], vaccination strategy  [11], [12]. In this model, the population is divided into susceptible S(t), infected I(t), and removed R(t) individuals at time t. The governing ordinary differential equations for the SIR model are as follows: (1)dS(t)dt=\u2212\u03b2S(t)I(t),(2)dI(t)dt=\u03b2S(t)I(t)\u2212\u03b3I(t),(3)dR(t)dt=\u03b3I(t) with initial condition S(0)=S0, I(0)=I0, and R(0)=R0. Here, the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3 denote the contact (susceptibility to disease) and removed (either dead or recovered) rates from disease, respectively  [13]. We assume that a removed individual can never be infected again. Let N be the constant total population size. Therefore, it is sufficient to solve only two Eqs. (1), (2), i.e., R(t)=N\u2212S(t)\u2212I(t). By assuming that \u03b2 and \u03b3 are time-dependent parameters, we generalize Eqs. (1), (2), (3) as follows: (4)dS(t)dt=\u2212\u03b2(t)S(t)I(t),(5)dI(t)dt=\u03b2(t)S(t)I(t)\u2212\u03b3(t)I(t),(6)dR(t)dt=\u03b3(t)I(t). For example, the transmission of the vector-borne diseases such as Dengue fever and Malaria has strong seasonal patterns and thus the parameters are estimated as the time-dependent functions  [14], [15]. Another example is a seasonal SIR model for the spread of the whooping cough in which the contact rate \u03b2 is given as a time-dependent periodic function which accounts seasonal changes  [16].",

Let DSn, DIn, and DRn be observed susceptible, infected, and removed data at time t=tn, respectively. Let Sn, In, and Rn be numerical approximations of S(tn), I(tn), and R(tn), respectively. In this paper, we propose a computation of \u03b2(t) and \u03b3(t) on a daily basis, which fit best to the real data. To be more specific, for given data (DSn,DIn,DRn) and (DSn+1,DIn+1,DRn+1), we want to find piecewise constant parameters \u03b2n+1 and \u03b3n+1 which minimize the following (7)min\u03b2n+1,\u03b3n+1[(Sn+1\u2212DSn+1)2+(In+1\u2212DIn+1)2+(Rn+1\u2212DRn+1)2], where Sn+1, In+1, and Rn+1 are the numerical solutions of Eqs. (4), (5), (6) with initial condition (Sn,In,Rn)=(DSn,DIn,DRn). We divide one day between tn and tn+1 into m subintervals, then \u0394t=1/m is the time step size. Let Sn+1,1=Sn and In+1,1=In, then by applying the explicit Euler\u2019s method to Eqs. (4), (5), we have (8)Sn+1,k+1=Sn+1,k\u2212\u03b2n+1Sn+1,kIn+1,k\u0394t,(9)In+1,k+1=In+1,k+(\u03b2n+1Sn+1,kIn+1,k\u2212\u03b3n+1In+1,k)\u0394t,(10)Rn+1,k+1=N\u2212Sn+1,k+1\u2212In+1,k+1,for  k=1,\u2026,m, where we have used the condition R(t)=N\u2212S(t)\u2212I(t). Unless otherwise stated, we use \u0394t=1/100 in all numerical tests. If the solutions of Eqs. (8), (9), (10) are obtained for all k, then we define Sn+1=Sn+1,m+1, In+1=In+1,m+1, and Rn+1=Rn+1,m+1. Note that while we can use higher-order numerical methods such as Runge\u2013Kutta schemes to solve Eqs. (4), (5), we use the explicit Euler\u2019s method for the sake of simplicity. Next, to find the best \u03b2n+1 and \u03b3n+1, we use a MATLAB routine called lsqcurvefit, based on the least-squares sense, which finds coefficients \u03b2n+1 and \u03b3n+1 that solve the problem (7). We use \u03b2n+1=1.0e\u22126 and \u03b3n+1=1.0e\u22121 as an initial guess in all numerical simulations. The MATLAB code is given inAppendix for the interested readers.",

If \u03c9 is close to zero, then we have a similar profile to R0,1,0n.

Let the total population N be divided into susceptible S(t), infected I(t), recovered R(t), and dead D(t) individuals at time t, then the SIR model with fatality rate is given by (14)dS(t)dt=\u2212\u03b2(t)S(t)I(t),(15)dI(t)dt=\u03b2(t)S(t)I(t)\u2212\u03b3(t)I(t)\u2212d(t)I(t),(16)dR(t)dt=\u03b3(t)I(t),(17)dD(t)dt=d(t)I(t) with initial condition S(0)=S0, I(0)=I0, R(0)=R0, and D(0)=D0. Here, the time-dependent parameters \u03b2(t), \u03b3(t), and d(t) denote the contact, recovered, and dead rates from disease, respectively  [22]. Now, by using the proposed method, we evaluate the numerical solution of the modified SIR model (14), (15), (16), (17). We take the same initial conditions: N=500,000, S0=N\u22121, I0=1, R0=0, and D0=0. The initial guesses for finding coefficients \u03b2, \u03b3, and d are 1.0e\u22126, 1.0e\u22121, and 1.0e\u22121, respectively. Using this model, we can predict the ratio of individuals who died by disease to the infected population at a given time. To investigate the ratio, we introduce the fatality percentage rate \u03bcn which is defined as \u03bcn=DnIn+Rn+Dn\u00d7100(%).\n",

The linearly extrapolated reproduction number, Rlinearn, has important implications for the future prediction of the trend of the reproduction numbers. We showed that the results computed by our method match very well with the actual data of the MERS-CoV spread in South Korea. Using the method proposed in this paper, one can predict the progress of the spread of infections on the use of real-time epidemic data, so that proper control policies can be performed in an appropriate time for reducing the spread of the infections. As future research, the methodology introduced in this paper can be applied to various diseases with other epidemic spreading models.",
