When one considers Janeway's 1989 proposition of the existence of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) as molecular immune receptors to fit microbial PAMPs, 1 then the explosion of knowledge that has come since in terms of the myriad of receptors that control and affect immune interactions becomes apparent. The importance of the elaboration of cell surface signaling molecules (CSSMs), particularly those important to modulating immune responses, in conjunction with the development, manufacture, and use of biologics molecules cannot be overstated. The therapeutic targeting of CSSMs as combined with the development of monoclonal antibodies from hybridoma technology by Kohler and Milstein [26] in 1975, and the continued elaboration of antibody paratopes to fit various antigen epitopes, including human receptors, has, effectively, brought to fruition Paul Ehrlich's original \"magic bullet\" concept [27] . The detailed knowledge of the working mechanisms of large, immune-active biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies is integral to understanding their function as \"magic bullets\". The interaction of therapeutic biomolecules with CSSMs is only beginning to affect the way microbiological control is viewed. At present, this difference is not largely appreciated as a paradigm shift. Manipulation of CSSMs is therapeutic control at the sub-cellular, molecular, and almost atomic level in terms of disease treatment. Biologic therapeutic action is often gained by the interaction of protein ligands and receptors as CSSMs. A lymphocyte has more than 300 CSSMs on its surface including TLRs and, all in all, based upon human genome project sequence annotation, \"more than 4,000 molecules have been identified as potential CSSMs, based on similarities in their transmembrane protein structure, along with their signature intracellular and extracellular domains\" (Zhu, Yao, and Chen).

See Fig. 8 .5. MAbs are large molecules that specifically target CSSMs to either prevent or promote (costimulatory/co-inhibitory) the fulfillment of functions important to specific cancers (in this instance). The mode of action of the biologics contrasts the small molecules Schematic representation of mechanism of action of HER2-targeted drugs. PZ recognizes an epitope within the HER2 dimerization domain, thus preventing interaction with other activated ErbB receptors. Moreover PZ recruits natural killer cells, which mediate ADCC. TKI act on HER2 tyrosine kinase activity, by blocking intracellular signaling. TZ binds the juxtamembrane portion of HER2, thus preventing receptor cleavage and stimulating ADCC response and receptor degradation after endocytosis of the HER2-TZ complex.

Gemcitabine is a nucleotide analog that mimics cysteine (the C in DNA/ATGC) but curtails replication due to imperfect mimicking of nucleotide action and cisplatin has a different mode of action but similarly disrupts DNA replication. Since cancer cells are the fastest growing cells (and apparently for no better reason), then more cancer cells die than normal cells. Thus, the SMD cancer treatments are more invasive (entering not just cancer cells but also healthy cells), non-specific (no specific molecular target other than the DNA common to all cells), prone to generate resistance over time (limited window of positive effects), and generally bring more unpleasant side effects than the new biologic drugs. According to Barker and Andrews: [28] This results in side effects which have a significant impact on the patient, such as gut toxicity, immunosuppression and hair loss; these effects limit the doses of chemotherapeutic that can be given and the overall efficacy that can be achieved in many situations. Thus, whilst cytotoxic chemotherapy is useful in some types of tumours, the results for many of the common solid tumours are relatively disappointing and agents that are effective against these solid tumours and which are better tolerated would represent a major step forward in the fight against cancer. 2 The advent of biologics (especially mAbs) that bind to various receptors (CSSMs) thought to be active in cancer progression has greatly improved therapy options for a number of cancer types, including targeting HER2 for breast cancer.

These insights led to the first successful enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for type I Gaucher disease that occurs with a frequency of 1 in 75,000 births worldwide, making it the most prevalent of the sphingolipid storage disorders. Gaucher disease is the result of an inborn error of metabolism due to a deficiency of the lysosomal acid \u03b2-glucosidase glycoprotein, \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase; \u03b2-glucosyl-N -acylsphingosine glucohydrolase) which cleaves \u03b2-D -glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside) into glucose and ceramide. The enzyme's substrate is a widely distributed cell membrane component and, in the absence of \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase, glucocerebroside, and other glycolipids accumulate by as much as 20-100-fold in the lysosomes of cells, particularly macrophages and other cells of the reticuloendothelial system. With this background, glucocerebrosidase prepared from human placenta and marketed as Ceredase\u00ae was used to reverse the clinical manifestations of type I Gaucher disease by targeting the patients' macrophages after sequential deglycosylation to expose mannose residues. Imiglucerase, a recombinant, deglycosylated glucocerebrosidase prepared in Chinese hamster ovary cells by DNA technology, was soon introduced and because it proved at least as clinically effective as Ceredase\u00ae and could provide a pathogen-free preparation in almost unlimited amounts, it (as Cerezyme\u00ae) soon replaced its predecessor. (Baldo) This example, along with the switch from animal-derived insulin to recombinant human insulin, shows the vast utility of recombinant proteins (r-proteins) as compared to harvesting natural forms (n-proteins). Hormones and peptide drugs include insulin, glucagon, human growth hormone, vasopressin, and parathyroid hormone. Glycoprotein hormones include follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone. As an aside, the use of r-proteins such as human insulin brings a greater exactness and specificity to treatments whereas reliance upon animal extracted proteins was time consuming, laborious and made for less desirable drugs (especially from a microbiological and adventitious contaminant control vantage). 3. Vaccines are harmless biological preparations made from infectious agents intended to stimulate the immune system to produce a long-lasting immune protection. Some important diseases remain that cannot be protected against via vaccination including AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and prion disease. Cancer vaccines are also being developed. MAbs are being developed as an immune treatment (as an alternative to long-acting vaccination) for some infections (as in RSV). 4 Subunit vaccines are viewed as safer in that a protein gene cloned and expressed for use as a specific antigen cannot revert to a disease-causing state as can an attenuated organism. An example of this is the hepatitis B vaccine that uses a surface protein to aid in the prevention of hepatitis associated liver cancer. DNA vaccines have also been developed to encode a specific antigen protein after injection. Interestingly, for DNA vaccines, CpG bacterial sequences are included as the adjuvant type. This speaks to the modern use of TLR activators (PAMPs) as adjuvants and parallels the inclusion concerns of impuirity/contaminants as adjuvants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1713, "end": 1720, "text": "(Baldo)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2913, "end": 2914, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biologics Drug Classes"}, {"text": "Beyond doubt, the advent of sequencing, rendering microbial genomes readily accessible, has been of utmost importance for vaccinology and has allowed for highly rational identification of vaccine antigens. Many novel vaccines currently in development are thus based on proteins or peptides predicted by computer databases or by screening antigen libraries [33, 34] . Although these advances in the post-genomic era have enabled the design of highly pure, safe and simple vaccines, other challenges have emerged in parallel, including the inherent lack of immunostimulatory properties of proteins and peptides. Vaccine adjuvants are therefore considered key components in modern vaccinology since they provide the necessary help of enhancing the immune responses [35] Here one may have picked up on an inherent contradiction. That is, that foreign proteins from microbes and virions produced recombinantly and purified are often not immunogenic and thus adjuvants (that are in essence contaminants) must be added whereas purified human recombinant proteins (such as based on IgG scaffold) manufactured as recombinant proteins often come with immunologic side effects.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 360, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 361, "end": 364, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 762, "end": 766, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biologics Drug Classes"}, {"text": "Early vaccines had no need for adjuvants, as they contained everything but the kitchen sink, microbiologically speaking.

Contained in that effort is also the attempt to stimulate the appropriate immune response pathway to match the specific immune mechanism of action of the disease which is being vaccinated against (see Fig. 8 .7).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 585, "end": 591, "text": "Fig. 8", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Biologics Drug Classes"}, {"text": "Very few antigens are inherently immunogenic and virtually all vaccines require adjuvants in some form, endogenous or exogenous. Without a component that engages either innate immune cells or additional receptors on lymphocytes such as complement receptors [36] , most non-adjuvanted, highly-purified antigens induce tolerance rather than immunity [37] . Very few antigens, such as certain toxins, are capable of inducing antibody responses when administered without adjuvants. Because of their immunogenicity, non-toxic derivatives of some toxins are being developed as adjuvants themselves, such as cholera toxin (CT) or E. coli enterotoxin (LT) (reviewed in [38] ). The first scientific reports of exogenous adjuvants deliberately added to vaccines are less than a century old and come from Gaston Ramon in the 1920s [39] . The substances he added to vaccines to \"enhance immune responses\" were complex and poorly defined and included tapioca starch and agarose. These early adjuvants, however, did trigger inflammation, which subsequently enhanced vaccine-specific lymphocyte responses. Adjuvanticity in this scenario is through a bystander effect with a significant amount of \"wasted inflammation\" (Quote from N.M. Valiante (Novartis Vaccines)), defined as excessive innate immune responses, which result in reactogenicity but only partially contribute to the adaptive immune response [40] . 4 . Coagulation factors -mammalian blood coagulation is a complex process with the interaction of many factors (and contrasts the greatly simplified Limulus coagulation process). Queen Victoria (born in 1819) had hemophilia and thus the disease had been known long before the blood system factors were characterized. There are two types -hemophilia A, which occurs due to the lack of clotting factor VIII, and hemophilia B, which occurs due to the lack of clotting factor IX. Both afflictions are typically inherited from one's parents through the X chromosome with a nonfunctional gene and thus disproportionately affect males. There are more than a dozen blood clotting factors produced recombinantly including Factor VIIa, VIII, IX, IX FC (fusion protein), XIII. In addition to recombinant forms there are also many forms purified from pooled human plasma. Some of both the recombinant and natural forms may include severe hypersensitivity and fever responses. The mechanism of supplying a specific enzyme for a clotting pathway is merely to supply the missing link (functional enzyme) that breaks the chain of events (i.e. protease cascade) necessary to properly coagulate the blood. 5. Cytokines-are produced by cells of the immune system and are generally thought of as signals act that locally upon CSSMs versus hormones which act over greater distance in the body, however, systemic effects also result from additive local effects from cytokines (including sepsis). This category includes both drugs used as cytokines and as cytokine receptor antagonists to modulate the immune response, including chemokines, interferons, interleukins, lymphokines, and tumor necrosis factors (TNF) but not hormones or growth factors (which are another class of biologic therapy). As of June of 2016, there were 23 approved cytokines (and antagonists) as biologics therapeutic drugs, including interferons, interleukins, erythropoietin, bone morphogenic proteins, receptor antagonists for IL, INF and TNF. Anakinra, for example, binds to the IL-1RI receptor thus blocking IL-1\u03b1 and \u03b2. The IL-1RI /IL1-\u03b1 and \u03b2 receptor system is important in governing the activities of cartilage degradation and bone resorption. An overview of the actions of various cytokines is given by Tisoncik et al. [42] \u2022 Interferons-regulation of innate immunity, activation of antiviral properties, anti-proliferative effects \u2022 Interleukins-growth and differentiation of leukocyte recruitment; many are proinflammatory \u2022 Chemokines-control of chemotaxis, leukocyte recruitment; many are proinflammatory \u2022 Colony-stimulating factors-stimulation of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation \u2022 Tumor necrosis factor-proinflammatory, activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 6 . Fusion or chimeric proteins-two different proteins, each with a unique function, can be fused to form a single therapeutic protein. Etanercept is a fusion protein that uses the Fc portion of IgG antibody linked to the ligand-binding portion of a TNF receptor. The binding of the fusion molecule to the TNF receptor prevents the interaction of the receptor with the TNF cytokine thus reducing the associated inflammatory responses in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. TNF receptor binding is shown below in Fig. 8 .8. 7. Cell therapy-the use of IgG fragments as well as whole immune cells (i.e. T cells) that have been genetically modified consists of those taken from an individual and returned to the same individual (autologous) and those that have been taken from one but returned to many (allogenic). The earliest cell types to be taken and returned were for bone marrow stem cell transplantation. Some promising new cancer treatments are based upon the modification of T cell receptors/ T cells such that they are sensitized to neoplasms. An interesting differentiation between cells grown for administration and those grown to produce a recombinant drug is that the cells for r-production are grown and discarded and are often known to accrue genetic aberrations over time (CHO) as this is not their natural mode of growth (cell culture). However, the introduction of whole cells must contain only cells that maintain the proper genetic structure (\"phenotype, genotype and even karyotype\") and must not contain cell culture media [44] . A rapidly emerging immunotherapy approach is called adoptive cell transfer (ACT): collecting and using patients' own immune cells to treat their cancer. There are several types of ACT (see \"ACT: TILs, TCRs, and CARs\"), but, thus far, the one that has advanced the furthest in clinical development is called CAR T-cell therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 261, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 348, "end": 352, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 661, "end": 665, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 820, "end": 824, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1394, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1397, "end": 1398, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3677, "end": 3681, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 4151, "end": 4152, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 5709, "end": 5713, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4679, "end": 4685, "text": "Fig. 8", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Biologics Drug Classes"}, {"text": "In 2017, two CAR T-cell therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), one for the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the other for adults with advanced lymphomas.

However, it also seems important to understand the historical discontinuity where it exists between modern biologics and historically antecedent drugs from a drug manufacturing and MCC perspective. Given the miraculous early history of some biologics, shocking successes that included rabies, smallpox and polio vaccines as well as early animal insulins, we should perhaps not be too surprised at the miraculous advances that have been gained through the biotechnology revolution as each class of biologic presented above may include a dozen life-saving and quality of life-enhancing molecules that treat a wide range of afflictions. The lame walk, the blind see, the infected are healed, the healthy are shielded from future disease, malignancies fall away, those that are genetically lacking are made whole. This is the full fruit of the biotechnology revolution that continues to amaze. The downside of the \"life-saving\" or \"life-changing\" designations are the unfortunate few that must stop therapy due to adverse reactions. The improvement of a specific drug's adverse event profile therefore has both a human and business component, in that attempts to reduce adverse reactions will help patients continue therapy as well as help drug manufacturers present fewer side effects in a competitive marketplace. This is the flip-side of gaining the power to cure disease or, at least, vastly increase the utility of therapy: the potential for denial of such treatment. As a rather worst-case example of the consequence of terminating biologics therapy due to adverse events such as the development of antibodies against an administered recombinant protein an example will be given. Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), which is \"caused by neutralizing antibodies to epoetin that cross-react with natural erythropoietin, produces a rapid decline in hemoglobin concentration, severe anemia, low reticulocyte count, and an almost total absence of red cell precursors\" (Baldo, 2017) .

In such instances, the discontinuation of a life-saving drug, needed in this case for end-stage renal disease patients, is catastrophic.

The affinity of Protein A to mAbs occurs via attachment to the Ig Fc domain [160] . Goyon et al. discuss the method they used to determine pI and the importance of the pI value in monoclonal antibody purification. cIEF 9 is a high resolution technique that separates species based on their pI or net charge, and takes into account solvent-exposed residues and internal amino acids. It has become the analytical platform of choice to characterize protein charge heterogeneity and determine experimental pIs. This part aimed at evaluating the pIs of 23 FDA and EMA approved mAbs as well as dalotuzumab and NIST mAb by comparing experimental results and theoretical calculations. As shown in Fig. 1 (here Fig. 8.29 ), pIs measured by icIEF were comprised between 6.1 and 9.4. The coefficient of variations (CVs) for three replicates were lower than 0.1% for all mAbs, confirming the robustness of icIEF, as already demonstrated by an inter-laboratory study [161] . Typical pI values, comprised between 8.0 and 9.0, were obtained for 13 mAbs [162] . Except infliximab and elotuzumab, 15 IgG1 have a pI higher than 8.0, while most of the IgG4 mAbs have pIs lower than 8.0 (this feature was related to the higher amount of acidic amino acids such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid in the primary sequence of IgG4). Therefore, our findings confirm that most IgG4 mAbs are less basic than IgG1 mAbs, in agreement with the literature. The ionic properties of the mAbs are a crucial parameter for their purification, as most processes include at least one ion exchange step [163] . For antibodies with a pI < 7.5, anion exchange chromatography (AEX) can be used in flow-through mode to remove process-related impurities. CEX is subsequently used to remove charged process-related impurities for mAbs with a pI > 7.0. In this context, cationic mAbs (pI > 7.0) [164] and especially those with a pI > 7.5 may be selected during developability studies, to avoid specific purification processes (e.g. host cell proteins removal and viral inactivation steps [165] ), therefore two pI thresholds limits were set at 7.0 and 8.5 in Fig. 1 .

Although FDA is requiring a rabbit pyrogen test as an interim solution for LER masked solutions, longer term they are requiring the development of more appropriate tests (via BLA post approval commitments).
