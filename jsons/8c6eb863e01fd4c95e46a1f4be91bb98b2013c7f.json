            "text": "The rush to understand new socio-economic contexts created by the wide adoption of AI is justified by its farranging consequences, spanning almost every walk of life. Yet, the public sector's predicament is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own efficiency -or in other words -to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms' intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments asssociated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; \"optimising\" the employment services\" in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided. This is of particular importance in light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships between institutions and citizens could strengthen -or undermine -trust in governance systems and democracy.",

Already back in the 1960s, calls on Robert F. Kennedy to hold a conference on robotics and labour, and later to start a Federal Automation Commission were both dismissed (Calo, 2017) . Although the questions of fairness and ethics of computer systems have been already asked in the 1990s (Friedman and Nissenbaum) , it is the report by US President's National Science and Technology Council Committee on Technology (The White House, 2016) , that has captured the attention of as diverse fora as national governments, international organizations (eg. UNDP, OECD, EU) industrial groups (eg. IEEE, WEF, AAAI, Partnership on AI), and academia. Although scholars fail to agree on the definitional explanation of Artificial Intelligence for over half a century (Russel and Norvig, 2013) , the working definition assumed in this document is in line with that proposed by the European Commission: \"systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and taking actions -with some degree of autonomy -to achieve specific goals\" (European Commission, 2018a) . Other than that, the terms artificial intelligence, machine learning and automated decision-making are used interchangeably.",

Hence, the narratives of competition and \"arms race\" is born and mirrored in the policy choices of the decision-makers. The introduction of 'business-like' practices that New Public Management brought into the government over 30 years ago, has translated into the wide adoption of market solutions, such as standards, incentives and benchmarks. These, have only been amplified by the turn towards evidence-based policy-making.

Among other popular survey, the Australian Public Sector Innovation Indicators (APSII) focuses on five themes: inputs, processes, outputs, outcomes, and environmental The report has identified seven requirements deemed to be key for the ethical development of AI-related technologies. These include: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and accountability. Such fairly general guiding poles are complemented by a pilot Trustworthy AI Assessment List that includes a set of 140 context-and sector-agnostic questions linked to the seven requirements, and is addressed to the 'developers and deployers of AI systems' as well as 'AI practitioners'. This pilot list is set to be reviewed after gathering the feedback on its usability from relevant stakeholders.",

Final recommendations to the federal government include: publishing a report on how automated decision systems are currently used within Canada's immigration and refugee system; freezing all efforts to procure, develop, or adopt any new automated decision system technology until existing systems are fully in compliance with a government-wide safety standard; and adopting a binding, government-wide standard for the use of automated decision systems. They also request: establishing an independent, arms-length body with the power to engage in all aspects of oversight and review of all use of automated decision systems by the federal government; creating a methodology to determine which public services are appropriate for the experimental use of automated decision systems and which are not; making complete source code for all federal government automated decision systems public and open source by default, and launching a federal Task Force to better understand the impacts of automated decision system technologies on human rights and the public interest.",

In the words of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki: \"only active state involvement can secure truly sustainable development\" whereas \"the liberal model adopted in Poland in times of economic transition is no longer able to cope with the new economic conditions brought in by the Fourth Industrial Revolution\" 4 . Such premise has become a cornerstone of the government's flagship Responsible Development Strategy -an overarching master-plan setting country's industrial goals all the way until 2030 (European Commission Digital Transition Monitor, 2018). Since its inception, the plan has introduced a number of new institutions that shall support the introduction of automation in the public and private sector. For instance, The \u0141ukasiewicz Research Network 5 has been started by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education to solidify cooperation between some 37 state-owned institutes and help achieve economies of scale. At the same time, the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology has initiated The Future Industry Platform Foundation 6 tasked with supporting the digital transformation of the industry and promoting automation among public and private sector alike. In 2018, one of the ministerial research institutes has been elevated and transformed into the newly established Polish Economic Institute 7 that aims to build a knowledge base and specific expertise for the public sector. In 2019, the government has introduced a GovTech Poland 8 programme to incentivize modernization of the public sector with the help of crowdsourced start-up solutions. These developments have to be assessed against the backdrop of wider market conditions that affect Poland -the fourth largest IT graduates pool in the EU (McKinsey, 2016), and the fourth lowest Digital Economy and Society Index score in the EU (European Commission, 2018b). In June 2018, Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Jaros\u0142aw Gowin announced that the country will create its own AI Strategy. It has been drafted by a fairly heterogeneous group of over 130 stakeholders working pro bono over the course of few months under the guidance of the Ministry of Digital Affairs.

Both Canadian and Polish cases have underlined the strong role civil society and academia can play in scrutinizing automated decision making systems -both at the stage of goal-setting, procurement and implementation. At the same time, it is becoming evident that the role of the state in AI policymaking is not to be downplayed -even if it takes a form of governing through adopting technological solutions at the center of its operations, and not writing laws.That being said, current AI policy debate is heavily skewed towards voluntary standards and self-governance, somehow disregarding power-related considerations. In particular, recentmeta analyses of AI ethical guidelines have pointed out (Jobin et al., 2019) to its reluctant approach towards enforcement mechanisms; lack of clarity to which norms should be prioritized; and a significant gap between agenda setting and its implementation. To the contrary, some have been hopeful about the potential of professional norms (Gasser and Schmitt, 2019) and soft, horizontal regulation (Veale and Brass 2019), while others urged to move beyond GDPR's art. 22 as the basis of automated decision making governance (Jobin et al., 2019).",

Yet another avenue for standard and indicator development is the development of voluntary guidelines that have been particularly popular in the context of AI policy. For instance, the European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on AI, after a year-long deliberative process, published the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (European Commission's HLGE on AI, 2019), complemented by over 500 comments received through the open consultation.",

A desired end might be to treat all crime equally.But does that imply police should focus resources on areas of high crime at the expense of those with low crime, to maximise total arrests? Or does it mean that a crime in a low-risk area is just as likely to be intervened in as a crime in a high risk area? Areas conceived of as 'high risk' are rarely distributed at random, coupled instead to communities with different demographic or vulnerability distributions. The means are also unclear. Should models be used to increase preventative measures, such as community policing, or to heighten response capacity after crimes have been reported?\"",
