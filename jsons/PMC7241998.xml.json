Early research attempted to develop these organoids from different progenitor cells, including basal cells, secretory cells, and alveolar epithelial cells.2 In the past 5 years, scientists were able to generate mature lung organoids that contain basal, ciliated, and club cells. These organoids were used to study diseases such as cystic fibrosis and lung tumours, and infections.3 One study4 used airway organoids to look at viral replication, tissue tropism, and immune response to many human influenza A and avian viruses.",

After the airway organoid is infected with SARS-CoV-2, immunofluorescence and electron scanning microscopes could be used to study the cytopathic effects of viral particles on different cell types. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR could determine viral replication kinetics and genetic alterations, and transcriptomic profiling could reveal the differential expression of genes related to viral infection. Additionally, flow cytometry enables the detection and quantification of different cell types before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
