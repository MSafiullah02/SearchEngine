Cancer research was directly affected by the emerging of this disease. According to some Chinese studies, cancer patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications. This observation led many oncologists to change their daily practice in cancer care, without solid evidence and recommendations. Moreover, the COVID-19 manifestations as well as its diagnosis are particular in this special population. In this review paper we expose the challenges of cancer management in the era of SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological, clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics of the disease in cancer patients and its outcomes on this population. Finally, we focus on strategies that are followed in cancer management with review of national and international guidelines.",

Human to human transmission of the virus occurs through respiratory droplets (by coughing or sneezing) and through direct contact with an infected patient or indirect contact with fomites in his environment (1, 2) . Since its outbreak in China at the end of 2019 and until the 5 th of April 2020, the pandemic has affected more than a million of people and caused 62773 deaths globally (3). It is thought that patients with comorbid conditions are more susceptible to manifest complications of the viral infection (4) . According to a recently published Chinese cohort, patients with cancer had a higher risk of developing severe events (intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, or death) compared with patients without cancer (39% vs 8%, p=0\u00b70003) (5) . Moreover, public health measures that are implemented in order to control the disease spread aim to decrease preventable hospital admissions and elective procedures (6) .",

Telephone screening of patients for any suspicious symptom before admission for elective procedures is also recommended by a group of practitioners, with a low threshold for undergoing nasopharyngeal swabs before surgery (71) . In gastroenterology, a change in practice was also witnessed (72) . For instance, in colorectal surgery, most elective procedures were limited in many centers over the country, but colorectal cancer surgeries were not part of this strategy and were maintained along with emergent procedures (73, 74) . Some practitioners in rectal cancer opted, in the absence of recommendations to substitute oral capecitabine for 5-FU whenever possible, and to adopt short course radiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting with delaying surgical interventions (75) .",

(16) published a cross-sectional analysis of 1524 patients with cancer in a tertiary hospital in the city of Wuhan. 12 of these patients (0.79%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. They concluded that the infection rate of COVID-19 in cancer patients was higher than the cumulative incidence reported over the same period in Wuhan (0.79% vs 0.37%, OR 2.31 [95% CI, 1.89-3.02]). Zhang et al. retrospectively analyzed 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients (17). Of note, the median age of infected patients was similar in both studies ( 66 and 65 years respectively), and lung cancer was also the most predominant type with more than half of the patients (seven of 12 patients) in the first cohort and 25% (7 of 28) in the second one. These conclusions were compatible with those of the prospective cohort of Liang et al. Moreover, both studies implied that hospital admission was an independent risk factor to acquire a SARS-CoV-2 infection, because most of cancer patients in the first study were receiving active in-hospital treatments (chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery), and 8 of 28 patients (28.6%) in the second study were suspected to have a hospital-associated transmission. Not only clinical presentation of COVID-19 in patients with cancer is particular, but also diagnosing this disease is challenging due to multiple factors: \uf0b7 Cancer patients might have atypical radiographic features.

On the other hand, in the 1099 patients cohort of Wei-Gie Guan et al previously mentioned, out of 10 patients who had cancer only one patient experienced an adverse event (ICU admission, ventilation or death)(13). This may suggest that adverse outcomes in malignancy are not as frequent as we think. Moreover, an analysis of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 in China showed that 58 had comorbidities, of whom 7% had a cancer history while 60% had hypertension or diabetes mellitus(27).",

Zhang et al. reported a higher rate of adverse events (53.6%) and mortality (28.6%) in their 28 cancer patients cohort, with a higher risk of sever events in patients who had their last anti-tumor treatment within 14 days of the infection (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037) (17). The three above studies (5,16,17) encouraged physicians to withhold or postpone cancer treatment during the epidemic, and this need was mainly urged by Liang et al based on an increased risk of adverse events in patients that received chemotherapy or underwent recent surgery prior to the infection, predisposing them to hematological toxicity and to an immunocompromised state. Regarding patients treated with immunotherapy, no clear data are yet available. A case report appeared on the 27 th of March discussing the history of an Italian patient with metastatic lung cancer who has been treated with nivolumab in the second line for 7 years with an excellent response, but died of a COVID-19 infection after a rapid clinical deterioration (28). Nevertheless, according to an Italian researcher, the conclusions of Liang et al. should be carefully extrapolated to patients receiving immunotherapy, especially in the adjuvant setting or for a curative intent, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f although the similarity in the mechanism of action of immune-checkpoint inhibitors and the COVID-19 infection in terms of cytokine release, and the common radiological finding of immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis and COVID-19 infection make this issue more challenging (29).Moreover, no patients in the prospective Chinese cohort were treated with targeted therapy, and only one patient was on osimertinib in the cohort of Jing et al. In the absence of data, the safety of targeted therapy is still unknown, but according to a case reported in China, one patient with EGFR positive lung adenocarcinoma treated with osimertinib was diagnosed with COVID-19 and successfully treated with the antiretroviral lopinavir/ritonavir, without withholding treatment with osimertinib.

Italy rapidly complained of a shortage of resources and some oncologists were called to help in the fight of COVID-19, some hospitals were transformed to admit COVID-19 patients only. An Italian young oncologists group suggested some measures to adapt to the situation based on their current practice. Those measures consisted mainly of delaying some anticancer treatment on case-by-case evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio especially for second line treatments and beyond for incurable metastatic disease, maintaining adjuvant and neoadjuvant as well as first line metastatic treatment, delaying imaging assessment for clinically stable patients, encouraging remote follow-up except for patients with clinical complaints suggestive of disease progression or for those who insist to get a physical exam, limiting caregivers company and respecting personal protection and distancing measures (65).",

All these propositions meet the recommendations published on the 14th of March by a group of French experts solicited by the president of Public Health Council on SARS-CoV-2 infection and solid cancers (77,78). We here summarize some of these guidelines: \uf0b7 In breast cancer, the Coll\u00e8ge Nationale des Gyn\u00e9cologues et Obst\u00e9triciens Fran\u00e7ais (CNGOF), the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Imagerie de la FEMme (SIFEM), the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Chirurgie Oncologique (SFCO), the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9nologie et Pathologie Mammaire (SFSPM) and the French Breast Cancer Intergroup-UNICANCER (UCBG) recommend to withhold screening programs during the pandemic, investigate only BIRADS IV and above lesions, perform ambulatory surgeries and avoid complicated reconstruction surgeries, avoid surgery in COVID-19 positive patients who have low grade tumors, delay adjuvant radiotherapy and privilege hypo fractionated protocols, maintain palliative radiotherapy for metastatic disease in patients with good performance status, maintain neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy but opt for the shortest possible protocols and prioritize oral chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (79).",

As for advanced disease, those recommendations agree on minimizing the risk of immunosuppression by avoiding corticosteroids for prostate cancer, substituting highly myelotoxic protocols with fewer toxic ones (gemzar-cisplatin instead of MVAC) with G-CSF use. However, the safety of immunotherapy for renal and urothelial carcinomas remains controversial and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis. \uf0b7 In sarcoma, The French Sarcoma group issued recommendations that encourage maintaining neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy for all patients who are not suspected to have a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and advise to ensure postoperative resuscitation capacities for high risk surgeries (84).",

            "text": "In hematology, researchers are most interested in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, first because of a higher risk of infection in neutropenic patients, and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f second because of the risk carried by stem cells donation, transportation and preservation as well as the difficulty to find donors with travel bans (87,88). A reported case of a Chinese patient who was treated with Cyclosporine A seven months following a bone marrow transplantation for AML and who died after acquiring a COVID-19 infection despite getting adequate care suggests that physicians should rethink the transplantation practice during the pandemic. The European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation EBMT issued recommendations to protect patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. They consist of differing transplantation for confirmed cases at least 3 months for low risk disease or until recovery for high risk disease. Symptomatic patients should be screened with multiplex PCR (with or without COVID-19 RT-PCR) and the intervention should be differed if possible. Deferral also applies for patients who have close contact with a positive case (and is strongly recommended for low risk patients) and COVID-19 PCR should be drawn in this case. Patients traveling from an endemic region should be isolated and have their intervention differed for 14 to 21 days especially in low risk disease. As for donors, those who have a confirmed infection with COVID-19 must be excluded from donation. Those who were close contacts with a positive patient or who are travelling from an endemic zone have to be excluded for 21 to 28 days and isolated with close monitoring of symptoms (89).\uf0b7 In breast cancer, guidelines on radiation therapy were issued by an international group of practitioners(90) and insisted on the following: o Avoiding radiotherapy for patients 65 years or older with invasive breast cancer without adverse features who are planned for hormone therapy.",
