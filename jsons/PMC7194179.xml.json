            "text": "Mesopelagic fish are perhaps the most ubiquitous and speciose of all fish in oceanic waters (Ahlstrom et al., 1976; Wisner, 1976). Adults of some species migrate vertically to surface waters at night (Paxton, 1967; Watanabe and Kawaguchi, 2003), and some lanternfish species (e.g. Benthosema panamense) form compact aggregations at the surface during daylight (Moser and Ahlstrom, 1970). Diurnal migrations are thought to play an important role in the vertical transport of biomass (biological convection). Mesopelagic fish contribute a considerable portion of the diets of commercially important fish, cephalopods, and marine mammals (Alverson, 1961; Gaskett et al., 2001). Their abundance and ecological role in the marine food chain are recognized in studies of marine ecology, but also in fisheries sciences, as a potential fishing resource (Kawaguchi and Shimizu, 1978).",

For example, seven mesopelagic species ranked in the 13 principal taxa identified by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) surveys from 1951 to 1984 (Moser et al., 1993). Early life history descriptions and spatial and seasonal distributions of early life stages are summarized in the literature (e.g. 1993, 1994; Moser, 1996). Mesopelagic species are the principal constituents of larval fish assemblages that inhabit offshore waters of the southerly California Current (Loeb et al., 1983a; Moser and Smith, 1993; Funes\u2010Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2002).",

El Ni\u00f1o events in 1982\u201383 and 1987\u201388 are detected along the Baja California coast as positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies (G\u00f3mez\u2010Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 1995; Hern\u00e1ndez\u2010Trujillo, 1999). Environmental changes associated with El Ni\u00f1o events may have a large impact on ecosystems, including expansion in the range of some adult fish populations and consequent expansion of their spawning area (Bailey and Incze, 1985; Moser et al., 1987; MacCall and Prager, 1988). During El Ni\u00f1o 1958\u201359, the distribution of fish larvae of tropical affinity expanded northward beyond their typical range in the California Current (Moser et al., 1987). During El Ni\u00f1o 1982\u201383 invertebrate zooplankton and micronekton and fish larvae off Baja California Sur were predominantly of tropical and subtropical affinity, while temperate species, although infrequent in the region, had more restricted geographical distributions during El Ni\u00f1o (1995, 2002; G\u00f3mez\u2010Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 1995; Hern\u00e1ndez\u2010Trujillo, 1999).",

In total 614 plankton net tows were made. Plankton samples were collected with a bongo net (333\u2010 and 505\u2010\u03bcm mesh) with a 0.5\u2010m mouth diameter that were towed obliquely between the surface and approximately 200 m maximum depth in open water, and to near\u2010bottom depth in shallower water (Smith and Richardson, 1977). A flow meter in the mouth of each net was used to calculate the volume of water strained. Plankton samples were preserved with 4% formalin buffered with sodium borate. Plankton biomass (mL per 1000 m3) was determined using the displaced volume technique (Beers, 1976). Fish larvae and eggs were sorted from the 505\u2010\u03bcm mesh samples. Mesopelagic fish larvae were identified from chapters in Moser (1996) as principal sources. Counts of fish larvae were converted to number under 10 m2 sea surface (Smith and Richardson, 1977).",

These species occurred mainly in the southern region of the California Current, and their larvae ranked third, eleventh, and sixth, respectively, among ichthyoplankton taxa identified from CalCOFI survey cruises from 1951 to 1984 (Moser et al., 1993). They occurred throughout the year; abundance of V. lucetia and T. mexicanus larvae peaked in summer and D. laternatus larvae peaked during late winter and again in summer (Moser et al., 1993). The current data set did not support the view that mesopelagic fish larvae had a marked seasonal trend in abundance and occurrence during the studied period. However, tropical species such as V. lucetia, and H. atratum peaked mostly during periods with a positive SST anomaly, principally during 1982\u201383, but D. laternatus appears to be more frequent when SST anomalies were smaller and varied between positive and negative, while the highest abundances and occurrences of T. mexicanus were principally during \u2018normal years\u2019 (1985\u201386). Historical data showed that T. mexicanus ranked second in abundance off central Baja California during the cool year 1975, followed by D. laternatus and V. lucetia (Loeb et al., 1983a), similar to the findings registered during \u2018normal years\u2019 (1985\u201386).",

(1987). The conjunction of diverse ecological assemblages is particularly pronounced at the southern extreme of the California Current where cold and warm water collide, creating rich \u2018meadows\u2019 (Malakoff, 2004). Our data on taxonomic composition confirms this. Subtropical and tropical species were the primary constituents (75%) of mesopelagic fish larvae off Baja California. Consequently, larval fish assemblages reflect the transitional nature of this part of the California Current region and its zoogeographic components (Moser et al., 1987). This is similar to hydrographic structures in the Kuroshio Current region and myctophid larvae assemblages related to it (Sassa et al., 2004). Other studies of plankton populations off Baja California Sur showed that the number of tropical species was relatively constant (G\u00f3mez\u2010Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 1995; Hern\u00e1ndez\u2010Trujillo, 1999). Nevertheless, there is high inter\u2010annual variation in species composition that could be related to changes in the California Current system and environmental shifts like El Ni\u00f1o. Such a shift between years was reported during the 1957\u201358 El Ni\u00f1o (Moser et al., 1987).",

The cool California Current is the predominant influence in the area during the first half of the year and the warm California Countercurrent predominates near shore in summer and autumn (Hickey, 1979; Lynn and Simpson, 1987). During El Ni\u00f1o events poleward flow is intensified and during 1982\u201383 northward excursions of high SSTs were exceptional (Norton et al., 1985). The 1982\u201383 El Ni\u00f1o event produced maximum positive anomalies along the Pacific Coast of Baja California, compared with a positive anomaly of about 1\u00b0C during the weak El Ni\u00f1o 1986\u201387 (G\u00f3mez\u2010Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 1995; Hern\u00e1ndez\u2010Trujillo, 1999).

We found that density of plankton increased principally during intense upwelling (60\u201380 m3 s\u22121) in spring, and a secondary (summer autumn) peak in plankton density appears to be associated with periods of weak southward advection of the California Current, in agreement with the findings of Loeb et al. (1983b). Mesopelagic fish larvae were scarce during spring plankton blooms, except during the 1983\u201384 El Ni\u00f1o conditions. Subarctic\u2010transitional species tended to occur although scarce in late winter and spring when the California Current is strongest, but these species were relatively uncommon or restricted to the north during spring 1983. Seasonal changes in abundance of mesopelagic fish larvae appear to be primarily controlled by reproductive activity of species with warm water affinity (>200 larvae under 10 m2 of sea surface), coinciding with the inshore countercurrent as the domain flow and favorable warm water conditions during summer.",

Species that are characteristic of the southern part of the California Current increase during El Ni\u00f1o conditions (V. lucetia, D. laternatus, H. atratum), and uncommon species (subarctic and transitional) may be affected by changes in flow regime resulting in seasonal or interannual expansion or contraction of spawning ranges. This also occurs in the euphausiid and copepod assemblages off Baja California with an increase in tropical species during El Ni\u00f1o conditions (Hern\u00e1ndez\u2010Trujillo et al., 1987; G\u00f3mez\u2010Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 1995; Hern\u00e1ndez\u2010Trujillo, 1999).",

Triphoturus mexicanus that is characteristic of the southern half of the California Current region may be less affected by changes in the flow regime off Baja California Sur, compared with species at or near their range limits which are probably at their southernmost occurrence in the California Current region. Triphoturus mexicanus was primarily associated with tropical, subtropical, and warm water cosmopolitan species (species group B), but occurs principally during \u2018normal\u2019 months, possibly related to the transitional nature of the Triphoturus group strongly connected with two larger recurrent groups of the southern complex (Vinciguerria and Symbolophorus; Moser et al., 1987).",
