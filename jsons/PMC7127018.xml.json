In Great Britain, a prospective study followed 8000 adults over 4 months. Eight percent of adults reported one episode of diarrhea during the previous month, resulting in an estimate of one episode of acute diarrhea per person per year [5]. Mortality from diarrhea is usually related to dehydration and greatest in the elderly and children living in developing countries [6], [7]. Severe acute diarrhea is more prevalent in vulnerable populations including travelers; the elderly; adults exposed to children; homosexual men; and individuals immunosuppressed by HIV infection, chronic steroids, or chemotherapy [8], [9].",

Clinically, diarrhea is a change in stools, usually defined as passage of three or more loose or watery stools or one or more bloody stool in 24 hours [8]. Acute diarrhea lasts less than 14 days, whereas diarrhea lasting more than 14 days is termed \u201cpersistent diarrhea,\u201d and longer than 1 month is termed \u201cchronic\u201d [12]. Severe acute diarrhea warrants immediate medical evaluation and hospitalization. The criteria for severe acute diarrhea include volume depletion, fever, six or more stools in 24 hours, an illness lasting longer than 48 hours, significant abdominal pain in individuals over 50 years, and immunocompromised patients [8], [13].",

Associated symptoms are abrupt onset of nausea and abdominal cramps followed by vomiting or diarrhea. Fevers occur in approximately 50% of affected individuals. Headache, myalgias, upper respiratory symptoms, and abdominal pain are common. Stool studies are negative for fecal leukocytes and blood. The illness is usually mild and lasts 1 or 2 days.

This is more common with ulcerative colitis but can be seen with Crohn's disease. Symptoms include diarrhea with mucus, rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain. Young adults between the ages of 20 and 40 are typically affected but the elderly can also have inflammatory bowel disease. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis relies on clinical history, stool studies to exclude infection, and either sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to document the extent of disease. Plain films can also provide information regarding the extent of disease and can diagnose the complication of toxic colon [114]. Medical management of ulcerative colitis includes glucocorticoids, aminosalicylates, and immunosuppressive agents including azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine [115]. Colectomy is reserved for patients with severe attacks who fail to respond to medical treatment, complications of a severe attack, dysplasia, or carcinoma [116].",
