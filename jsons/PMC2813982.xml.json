In ruminants, RVF is characterized by substantial mortality of young animals (especially of lambs), fetal deformities and abortion (Flick and Bouloy, 2005, Gerdes, 2004, Swanepoel and Coetzer, 2003). In humans the disease is often associated with benign fever but can lead to more complicated cases such as retinal vasculitis, encephalitis, neurologic deficits, hepatic necrosis, or fatal hemorrhagic fever (Flick and Bouloy, 2005, Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004, Meegan, 1979). Interestingly, human case fatality rates increased significantly during the last several years. While historically less than 2% of infected individuals developed a fatal hemorrhagic fever, analysis from recent outbreaks (2007/2008) reveal a 20\u201330% fatality rate in humans (LaBeaud et al., 2008). However, differences in case definition, accuracy in disease surveillance methods and data gathering methodology likely impact these numbers.",

Bunyaviruses are enveloped viruses with a tripartite, single-stranded RNA genome of negative and sometimes ambisense polarity (Elliott, 1996, Elliott et al., 1991, Schmaljohn and Hooper, 2001). The large (L) genomic RNA segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), the medium (M) segment the glycoprotein precursor, which is post-translationally processed into the two mature spike proteins (G1 and G2, or by the new convention: GN and GC), and in some viruses a non-structural protein (NSM), while the small (S) segment encodes the nucleoprotein (N), and in some viruses a non-structural protein NSS (Elliott, 1996, Schmaljohn and Hooper, 2001).",

            "text": "The use of virus-like particles (VLPs) is a promising approach for the development of a safe and efficient RVFV vaccine. Expression of structural proteins of many non-enveloped and enveloped viruses leads to the formation of VLPs (Garcea and Gissmann, 2004, Grgacic and Anderson, 2006a, Grgacic and Anderson, 2006b, Noad and Roy, 2003). Such VLPs frequently exhibit a morphology very similar to that of wild-type (wt) viruses (Johnson and Chiu, 2000). Since VLPs have a tropism similar to that of the wt virus and show comparable cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking, the formation of VLPs can be used to study virus assembly and morphogenesis, budding processes, genome packaging, receptor binding, and virus entry (Bos et al., 1997, Johnson and Chiu, 2000, Li et al., 2003, Licata et al., 2004, Overby et al., 2006, Schmitt et al., 2002, Ye et al., 2006). Especially for viruses classified as high containment agents, e.g., RVFV and Ebolavirus, the development of VLP systems are of practical use because subsequent work can be performed under lower biosafety conditions (Habjan et al., 2009, Naslund et al., 2009, Warfield et al., 2004, Watanabe et al., 2004). VLPs present viral antigens in a native conformation and are effectively recognized by the immune system (Grgacic, 2006; Grgacic and Anderson, 2006; Noad and Roy, 2003).",

We initially focused upon the generation of chimeric (MoMLV gag-containing VLPs, designated RVF chimVLPs) because it has been previously shown that the inclusion of retroviral gag can increase the uniformity and quantity (Gheysen et al., 1989, Haffar et al., 1990, Haynes et al., 1991, Rovinski et al., 1992, Szecsi et al., 2006) and stability (Hammonds et al., 2003) of VLPs. In addition, MoMLV gag protein could have an adjuvant-like effect. RVF VLPs were harvested from tissue culture supernatants from 48 to 96 h post-transfection, concentrated by tangential flow filtration and purified by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion. To analyze VLP components, samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blots using RVFV and MoMLV-specific antibodies.",

Suboptimal codon usage often leads to the inefficient expression of viral protein genes in mammalian cells (Barrett et al., 2006, Haas et al., 1996, Zhou et al., 1999). We therefore compared the amount of RVF chimVLPs generated by 293-gag cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding either native or codon-optimized (Babcock et al., 2004) RVFV G genes. No significant difference in GN content of concentrated and purified VLP preparations was observed when separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 1D). However, the use of the codon-optimized RVFV G appears to have a minimally beneficial effect on VLP yield. Similar results were obtained when RVF VLPs were generated in 293 cells (data not shown). Therefore, for all subsequent experiments the codon-optimized sequence was utilized.",

The neutralizing antibody titer is considered positive at the highest serum dilution that inhibits 80% of the plaques compared with the virus control titration. As shown in Fig. 3\n, neutralizing titers of > 1:640 were obtained for all RVF chimVLP and RVF VLP - N (no nucleoprotein) vaccinated mice (n\n = 4), while three of four RVF VLP + N-vaccinated mice developed titers of > 640 and one of 320.

Splenocytes were harvested from mice vaccinated three times with RVF chimVLPs (days 0, 9 and 18) 31 days post final vaccination and cultured in 24-well dishes.

Supernatant samples were taken at 24, 96, and 168 h and subjected to cytokine analysis using a bead-based multiplex system (Bioplex, BioRad). Splenocytes from vaccinated mice secrete antigen-specific cytokines in response to MP12 stimulation, but not to the unspecific influenza antigen (Fig. 4\n, blue bars). Splenocytes from the control (unvaccinated) mouse do not respond to either stimulus (Fig. 4, red bars). IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-\u03b3 production is elicited by the RVFV-specific antigen, consistent with both humoral (TH2) and cellular (TH1) responses (Chung et al., 2008, Fromantin et al., 2001).

Therefore, groups of 20 mice were immunized on days 0, 9, and 18 with select vaccine candidates: chimeric VLPs produced in 293-gag cells (chimVLP), VLPs produced in 293 cells with RVFV G and N (VLP + N) and VLPs produced in 293 cells without RVFV N (VLP - N). Forty-six days after the third vaccination (64 days post first vaccination), 16 of 20 animals were challenged with 103 pfu RVFV ZH501 under biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) conditions and observed for signs of disease for 18 days (Fig. 5\n). The remaining four mice per group were used for the PRNT80 experiments (Fig. 3). As expected, all animals vaccinated with PBS only or a non-specific MoMLV-based vaccine (control 1 and 2, respectively) succumbed to RVFV challenge within the first 4 to 6 days. This demonstrates that MoMLV-specific components of the vaccines do not protect mice from RVFV challenge. Nine of 16 (56%) of the VLP + N vaccinated mice survived lethal challenge, while only three of 16 (\u223c19%) survived if immunized with VLP - N vaccine. These results show that protection from RVFV challenge is dependent upon the presence of RVFV G proteins and is enhanced by the presence of RVFV N. chimVLP-vaccinated mice showed the best survival rates, as 11 of 16 (68%) mice survived the lethal challenge dose. Significance was determined using the Mantel\u2013Cox test, and significant differences exist between groups including chimVLP and VLP - N (P\n = 0.001), VLP + N and VLP - N (P\n = 0.0196), all three vaccinated groups and controls 1 and 2 (P\n = 0.0001 (chimVLP), P\n = 0.0001 (VLP + N) and P\n = 0.0007 (VLP - N). There is no significant difference between the chimVLP and VLP +N groups (P\n = 0.393).",

Therefore, after promising data were obtained in the mouse model, RVF VLP-based vaccine efficacy (survival) was next analyzed in a lethal rat challenge model. Our objective was to test only the best vaccine candidate (based on the immunological and mouse protection studies) with a minimum number of animals. Groups of six rats were immunized three times at 2-week intervals with the chimeric RVF VLP vaccine candidate or a sterile saline control. Sixty-seven days post third vaccination (95 days post first vaccination), rats were challenged with a high dose of 105 pfu RVFV ZH501 and examined for signs of disease for 16 days. Body weight was monitored daily as an indication of the overall health of the rats. As shown in Fig. 6A, while all control rats succumbed to disease by day 4 post-challenge, the RVF chimVLP vaccine candidate protected 100% of the vaccinated rats. Unvaccinated control rats showed rapid and substantial weight loss before succumbing to challenge, whereas RVFV chimVLP-vaccinated animals generally maintained their weight throughout the course of the experiment (Fig. 6B).",

            "text": "The structural proteins of many viruses can assemble into VLPs (Grgacic and Anderson, 2006). VLPs are often described as being more efficacious in the activation of immune responses than conventional protein immunogens/subunit vaccines because their immunogenic protein components are displayed in a high density, more authentic conformation, often with intact biochemical functionality that is effectively immunogenic (Garcea and Gissmann, 2004; Grgacic, 2006; Noad and Roy, 2003). This is further enhanced by the particulate nature of VLPs that appears to be optimal for uptake by dendritic cells (Fifis et al., 2004). In addition, they are safer than inactivated and attenuated virus vaccines because they are usually free of viral genetic material and therefore are not encumbered by the possible safety-related drawbacks including reversion, recombination and re-assortment. At this stage, the ability to develop VLPs does not appear to be limited to any one type of virus or virus family, or by the complexity of the virus particle.",

We have established an efficient system to generate RVFV chimVLPs and VLPs from 293-gag and 293 cells (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). These VLPs are immunogenic as indicated by the generation of neutralizing antibodies in vivo by immunized mice (Fig. 3) and antigen-specific secretion of immune-related cytokines by splenocytes from vaccinated mice (Fig. 4). Furthermore, these VLP-based vaccine candidates are partially protective in mice and 100% protective in rats against lethal challenge (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Interestingly, RVF VLP production requires only the expression of the two glycoproteins GN and GC, and therefore RVFV N is not required. While consistent with findings by Overby et al. (2006) who were able to generate UUK and bunyamwera VLPs without N, this contradicts recent findings that suggest RVF VLPs could only be generated through expression of RVFV glycoproteins together with RVFV N (as part of the minireplicon system) (Habjan et al., 2009). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the use of different expression systems (e.g., chicken \u03b2-actin vs. immediate-early cytomegalovirus promoter) leads to substantially different amount of RVFV G being produced, and RVF VLPs derived only from the expression of RVFV G requires high levels of expression.",

Unfortunately, the generation of RVF chimVLPs is more complicated because RVFV G and MoMLV gag localize to the Golgi (Gerrard and Nichol, 2002, Schmaljohn and Hooper, 2001, Wasmoen et al., 1988) and plasma membranes (Soneoka et al., 1997), respectively, in mammalian cells.

Further attempts to increase RVFV G surface localization by generating chimeric RVFV G proteins containing the ectodomain of RVFV G and the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the MoMLV Env (C-terminal 56aa of the envelope polyprotein, accession number GI:331936), which removes a putative Golgi retention signal of RVFV GN, did not significantly increase RVFV G content on cell surfaces as demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies and did not result in increased chimVLP yields (data not shown).",

            "text": "Optimization of VLP production is important for the ability to scale-up for the generation of material required for non-human primate and livestock studies and ultimately clinical grade vaccine production. First, as seen in Fig. 2A, the ratio of transfected expression plasmid for the RVFV G and N proteins influences VLP yields. Second, optimal generation of VLPs is clearly observed when the N plasmid is included, and increasing amounts of N expression plasmid enhances the generation of RVFV VLPs. Similar findings were also reported for the generation of UUK VLPs (Overby et al., 2006). The addition of a RVFV-specific minigenome did not significantly increase the N content of generated VLPs despite the fact that VLPs were able to package minigenome and transfer reporter gene activity into VLP-infected cells (M. Bouloy and R. Flick, unpublished data). This contradicts previous findings by Overby et al. (2006) who showed that omission of a minigenome leads to almost no nucleoprotein incorporation into UUK VLPs. Generation of VLPs is optimal between 24 and 60 h post-transfection (Fig. 2B) as determined via time course experiments. Furthermore, multiple harvests during a  120-h time period post-transfection results in higher VLP yields compared to less frequent harvests. This is consistent with our previous studies which show that multiple harvests of Ebolavirus and Lassa virus chimVLPs yields substantially more VLPs compared to a single harvest or collections at intervals longer than 12 h (data not shown). This might reflect VLP stability or binding to the producing cells.",

Interestingly, as seen in Fig. 3, while similar neutralizing antibody titers are generated by RVF VLPs with or without N, these results do not correlate with vaccine efficacy in the mouse model, as seen in Fig. 5, where N-containing RVF VLPs are substantially more efficacious compared to VLPs lacking RVFV N. As demonstrated with DNA vaccines expressing only the RVFV M ORF, while it is likely that immunity to RVFV is determined by the response to the RVFV G (Lagerqvist et al., 2009, Spik et al., 2006, Wallace et al., 2006), the results described above suggest that N might represent an important component of an efficacious RVFV vaccine. It has been demonstrated that both RVFV N (Lagerqvist et al., 2009, Wallace et al., 2006) and Toscana virus (a related bunyavirus) N (Gori Savellini et al., 2008) are partly protective against lethal challenge in mice. Interestingly, while previous passive transfer studies would suggest that the generation of neutralizing antibodies to RVFV GN and GC is predictive of vaccine efficacy (Besselaar and Blackburn, 1991, Schmaljohn et al., 1989), our RVF VLP without N, while sufficient for the generation of neutralizing antibodies (see Fig. 3), is not efficacious in the mouse challenge model (see Fig. 5).",

MP12 sequences were chosen as the source of the glycoprotein gene because it allowed us to perform initial challenge studies with MP12 under lower containment conditions (data not shown). cDNA was prepared using RT PCR (Thermoscript RT-PCR Kit) with oligo dT primers. A 3.3 kb 5\u2032-truncated fragment of the RVFV M segment was amplified from cDNA using Phusion HF polymerase (Phusion High Fidelity PCR Mastermix, Finnzymes) and RVFV M segment-specific primers: 5\u2032GCAATCGATGCAGGGATTGCAATGACAGTC and 5\u2032GCACTCGAGCTATGAGGCCTTCTTAGTGGCAG. This results in translation of the RVFV glycoprotein precursor from the 4th available start codon to facilitate optimal glycoprotein expression (Collett et al., 1985, Gerrard and Nichol, 2007, Suzich et al., 1990). Next, a Kozak sequence (Kozak, 1984a, Kozak, 1984b, Kozak, 1987, Kozak, 2002) was added immediately 5\u2032 to the ATG start codon by PCR amplification using Phusion HF polymerase with the following RVFV M segment specific oligos: 5\u2032TTAATGAATTCGCCACCATGGCAGGGATTGCAATGACAGTCCTTCC and 5\u2032GCACTCGAGCTATGAGGCCTTCTTAGTGGCAG. This PCR product was cloned downstream of the chicken \u03b2-actin promoter into the pCAGGS expression vector (Kobasa et al., 1997, Niwa et al., 1991) (kindly provided by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA) via EcoRI/XhoI restriction endonuclease sites. Plasmid DNA used for transfections was prepared (0.323 mg/ml, cesium chloride (CsCl)-purified) by the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Recombinant DNA Laboratory (Galveston, TX, USA). A codon-optimized (codon usage as described in Babcock et al., 2004) version of the truncated RVFV glycoprotein precursor gene was synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA; GenBank accession number GQ148915) that contains a Kozak sequence immediately 5\u2032 to the ATG start codon and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites for subsequent cloning steps. This gene was cloned into pCAGGS expression vector via the EcoRI/XhoI restriction endonuclease sites. The plasmid preparations used for transfections was prepared (0.5 mg/ml, NucleoBond column-purified (Machery-Nagel) by the Nature Technology Corporation (Lincoln, NE, USA).",
