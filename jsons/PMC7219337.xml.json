The idea presented in this paper has been successfully verified and implemented and the conclusions were here in detail presented. The HISS are able to provide detailed verified and profiled information on the interlocutor, before the actual interaction takes place. Therefore, the use of preliminary identification and categorization mechanisms during and before verbal human-machine interaction can provide a sense of temporal adequacy when initiating contact with the system, greatly improving the overall User Experience of interlocutors. The features, which can be acquired by the proposed HISS subsystems during the pre-interaction stage (regarding some of the characteristics of a particular interlocutor), as well as the fact of their earlier acquisition, accelerates and improves identification of the interlocutor.",

This strategy combines the sensing technologies embedded in infrastructure and the equipment it interacts with. Real-time data acquisition and analysis in conjunction with the information already gathered, results in better interpretation of the data [1], which is clearly visible in inter alia numerous Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare applications [6] or in robotics [7], or in autonomous systems [8].

There are many valued message brokers on the market, such as inter alia: Apache Kafka, Nats.io and RabbitMQ. The choice has been made to implement the Apache Kafka broker, while it has a universal protocol, enables to be implemented in any component of system, including sensor nodes. A sensor node consists of a hardware sensor (e.g., a microphone or passive infrared sensor [14]) and a communication enabling Embedded System. A sensor node (ES with a hardware sensor) is designed to take advantage of the Smart Infrastructure, so that it would return high-level result. The reachability of every system component, in particular the HISS subsystems and the cloud-based services, requires additional verification/monitoring, using dedicated passive watchdog modules. One of the most problematic services, which had to be monitored was the Speech-to-text (STT) service, to ensure its availability. The availability validation was performed with sending a simple test stream before the interaction.",

However, incidental noise may require a sophisticated active noise reduction.

This is particularly important and useful for artificial intelligence applications, which use natural language communication. Such systems are often equipped with additional/external sensors with better technical parameters. A professional microphone, with properly selected characteristics, acquires the interlocutor\u2019s voice much better than the one that is built-in into the robot, an external camera provides a wider angle and/or greater quality/visibility than the stock camera built into the robot and will offer a better input to the system.",
