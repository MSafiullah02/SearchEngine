Bone health assessment during critical illness is challenging, and direct bone strength measurement is not possible. We used a rodent sepsis model to test the hypothesis that critical illness causes early reduction in bone strength and changes in bone architecture. Methods 20 Sprague-Dawley rats (350 \u00b1 15.8g) were anesthetised and randomised to receive cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) (50% cecum length, 18G needle single pass through anterior and posterior walls) or sham surgery (cecum mobilised, no CLP), and then returned to their cages. 10 rodents (5 CLP, 5 sham) were sacrificed at 24 hours, and the remaining 10 at 96 hours. Femur bones were harvested and bone strength testing was conducted using the Instron 5543 (Instron Corp, USA). Trabecular bone strength was measured using a femoral neck break and cortical bone strength tested using a femoral shaft 3point bending test. Bone architecture was assessed using microcomputerised tomography (microCT) imaging (PerkinElmer, USA), and images analysed with BoneJ [3] .",

In the acute phase, this was illustrated by higher plasma ALT (P = 0.0001), and by elevated markers of apoptosis (P = 0.001) and more mitochondrial dysfunction (Complex V activity, P = 0.02) in liver. In the prolonged phase, hepatic autophagy inactivation increased apoptosis (P = 0.01) and aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction (Complex V activity, P = 0.005) in liver. Autophagy deficiency did not affect mitochondrial DNA content (day 1 P = 0.98, day 3 P = 0.57). Autophagy deficiency time-dependently modulated several branches of the UPR in liver. On day 1, it decreased activation of the IRE1alpha-XBP1s (P = 0.003) and ATF6-CREB3L3 pathway (P = 0.003), coinciding with a diminished inflammatory response as shown by lower C-reactive protein gene expression (P = 0.006), but did not affect the p-eIF2alpha pathway (P = 0.26).

We measured the pulmonary lactate production and shunt fraction during bacteremia. Sepsis is a condition characterized by severe organ failure as a result of a dysregulated response to infection. Central in many pathophysiological theories is the decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen by tissues. Normal physiology dictates that hypoxia leads to lactate production, a prognostic marker in sepsis. Thus, hypoxia has been used as an explanation for both organ dysfunction and elevated plasma (p-)lactate in sepsis. However, new research has implied other mechanisms. Previous studies have reported increased pulmonary lactate production in sepsis [1] , the lungs being a generally well-oxygenated organ.

In 7 samples were found ESBL positive pathogens, 5 coming from surgical wards, 1 from ER and 1 from medical ward. From the blood cultures, 11.6% were positive. The most common pathogen was S. epidermidis in 46 samples. Regarding MDRs, we found 9 MRSA, 5 ESBL positive germens and 4 A. baumanii. The MRSA positive samples were obtained from patients coming mostly from surgical wards (5), followed by medical wards (2) and ER (2), with an LOS before ICU admission of 9.4 days. The ESBL positive pathogens were found in 3 patients admitted from ER and 2 patients from surgical wards, with average LOS previous to admission of 4.6 days. A. Baumanii was identified in 2 patients coming from medical wards, 1 from surgical and 1 from ER.

Thereafter, an Escherichia coli intravenous infusion of 8.3 log 10 Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/h was administered for 3 h. The endotoxin unexposed group (Unexp) (n = 18) was given an identical bacterial challenge but without the preceding exposure of endotoxin.

Both of these agents are widely used in various hematologic indications in mono and poly therapeutic approaches. Currently, a recombinant version of thrombomodulin, ART-123 (Recomodulin) is undergoing clinical trials to validate its efficacy in sepsis-associated coagulopathy. Recomodulin is a novel, recombinant and soluble thrombomodulin, and is a human protein with both thrombin inhibiting and protein C stimulating activities. In comparison to both UFH and AT, this agent has relatively weaker anticoagulant activities related to bleeding risk at therapeutic concentrations of < = 1.25 ug/mL. Supratherapeutic concentrations of this agent may occur in some patients with renal dysfunction. The purpose of this study is to compare the anticoagulant and platelet modulatory effects of ART-123, UFH, and AT. Methods UFH of porcine origin was obtained from Medefil Inc. (Glendale Heights, IL) in powdered form with a specific activity of 175 U/mg. A working concentrations of this agent was made at 100 ug/mL in sterile saline. AT was commercially obtained from Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Deerfield, IL). A working concentration of AT was prepared at 100 U/mL in sterile saline. Recomodulin was commercially obtained and was manufactured by Asahi Kasei Pharma (Japan). A working concentration of Recomodulin at 100 ug/mL was prepared in sterile saline. The effect of Recomodulin, AT, and UFH on the glass activated clotting time and thromboelastographic (TEG) profile was measured at concentrations of 0-5 ug/mL.

Temperature changes compared to target temperature over time assays including PT, APTT, and TT were also measured in citrated whole blood and retrieved plasma.

Figure 22A shows that K.pneumoniae (68/124) and E coli (42/124) were the majority isolates contributed most of the drug resistance genes identified. Carbapenem susceptibility significantly declined by an average of 35% (2-80), driven in part by increase in resistance in K pneumoniae isolates (Fig. 22B) . On the contrary, susceptibility to amikacin significantly increased, while that of piperacillin/tazobactam decreased to 59%. Of the 26 isolates nonsusceptible to carbapenems; 6 (23%) were CAI and were 12 (46%) were HAI; p = 0.468 (Fig. 22C ). CTXM-15 lactamase was the most frequent gene identified I 85/124 (65%) of isolates; but, was found in combination with other genes 67/ 81 (83%) of the time. In fact, the odds for nonsusceptibility to carbapenems rose 26-folds (3-245) when 4 genes were present compared to isolates with only one drug resistance gene was present for all isolates. Conclusions CTXM-15 carrying K pneumonia are emerging as causes of CRE associated IAI in South Africa. Piperacillin/tazobactam is an unlikely substitute antibiotic for this patient cohort given declining susceptibility trends and overall poor activity. Introduction Intraosseous (IO) access may be lifesaving in medical emergencies, when conventional vascular access is difficult to achieve. In lifethreatening infections, early administration of antibiotics is crucial. In septic shock, the circulation is markedly compromised. We wanted to elucidate whether sufficient blood levels are reached, when antibiotics are administered IO [1] . Methods A model of endotoxemic shock was used, where 8 anaesthetized, extensively monitored, pigs were given a continuous infusion of E. Coli endotoxin over 6 hour period, after which, the animals were sacrificed. The Animal Ethics Committee of Uppsala University, Sweden, approved the experiment. IO access was achieved in the tibial bone (EZ-IO\u00ae, Teleflex Medical, Morrisville, NC, USA). Cefotaxime at 75mg/ kg and gentamicin at 7 mg/kg, respectively were administered IO or intravenously (IV). Central concentrations of these antibiotics were measured at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min.",

Enteral nutrition is the preferred route of nutrient supply in critically ill patients who are not able to consume oral foods. Monitoring of upper GI function has an important role in the decision of the continuation of enteral nutrition. Measurement of gastric residual volume (GRV) is recommended for monitoring of GI function and avoidance of aspiration and pneumonia. However, there are some studies which have not shown any relationship between high GRV and risk of aspiration and pneumonia in critically ill patients. So, validity of GRV as a marker for risk of aspiration in mechanically ventilated patients is still unclear.

Data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and are presented as median [interquartile range] or mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Mann-Whitney or ttests were used as appropriate. Results FGF19 levels were decreased in the diarrhea group (0.20 \u00b1 0.12 vs. 0.29 \u00b1 0.10 ng/mL, p = 0.03) indicating disturbed enterohepatic signaling.

Bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-GT levels were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions Diarrhea in critical illness disturbs the normal enterohepatic circulation of bile salts, as evidenced by reduced plasma levels of FGF19.

Despite not being supported by the most recent International Association of Pancreatology guideline the modified Glasgow score remains very widely used, in part because a score of >/=3 is often claimed (by surgeons) as an indication for admission to Critical Care Unit (CCU). The score requires measurement of Lactate dehydrogenase, as this is often not included on admission blood tests the patient must either be re-bled or the test \"added-on\" to stored samples. Completing the score therefore incurs an additional expense. We sought to determine whether completing the score (by measurement of LDH) has any value in predicting CCU admission. Methods All patients admitted with a diagnosis of pancreatitis to our institution in 2015 were reviewed. The components of the Glasgow score on admission were recorded along with admission to CCU, length of stay and long term outcome. Relative risk of admission to CCU was calculated in the presence or absence of LDH measurement and again for normal or abnormal levels. An LDH level of >600 U/l was regarded as abnormal.

Patients with soiling at initial operation were 4 times more likely to have a defunctioning stoma formed. Both the APACHE II and ICNARC risk prediction models identified the defunctioned group as being at greater mortality risk; the groups were otherwise well matched at baseline. In the subgroup of patients with soiling of the abdomen at initial operation, hospital length of stay was shorter (13 vs 18 days) and more patients were discharged alive (81% vs 66%) if they had undergone defunctioning as opposed to primary anastomosis. No significant difference in organ support, need for repeated operation or overall critical care or hospital mortality or length of stay was identified between the two groups. Conclusions This is the first study to examine the impact of the decision to either anastomose or defunction bowel at emergency laparotomy and link this to post-operative morbidity and outcome. Our data suggests that patients with soiling at initial operation have a lower critical care and hospital mortality, and a shorter length of hospital stay if a defunctioning stoma is performed. No other differences were noted in any of the indices examined. This evaluation has significant implications both locally and nationally for the management of patients undergoing emergency laparotomy.",

The American College of Gastroenterology treatment guidelines for GIB recommend IV pantoprazole 80 mg bolus followed by 8 mg/h infusion [1] . In 2015, our health system switched from CI pantoprazole to IMB dosing as a response to an IV pantoprazole shortage. To our knowledge, there is currently a paucity of literature, which directly compares the two dosing strategies at consistent and specific dosages. This study aims to contribute additional data to the current body of knowledge. Methods This retrospective chart review evaluated the treatment of GIB with either pantoprazole CI or IMB. Patients who received IV pantoprazole therapy for at least 24 hours and had an upper endoscopy (EGD) with high-risk stigmata of bleeding were included. The primary outcome was rebleeding within 3 days of starting pantoprazole.",

Baseline characteristics appeared to be similar between the two groups except for patients receiving an initial 80mg bolus, which occurred more frequently in the CI group (CI 78% vs. IMB 25.5%). There was no difference between either group for the primary outcome with 4 patients in the IMB group and 7 patients in the CI group who met criteria for rebleeding within 3 days (p = 0.20).

Conclusions IMB pantoprazole was comparable to the guideline recommended CI pantoprazole for the treatment of GIB in patients with endoscopic findings of high-risk stigmata of bleeding.

When it is caused by an impaired carbohydrate metabolism due to hypoxia, lactic acidosis may occur increasing blood lactate and reducing pH. Our group has integrated the treatment of acidosis into an Advanced Organ Support (ADVOS) system based on albumin dialysis. It consists of 3 circuits that allow elimination of water and protein bound toxins, regeneration of the albumin used in the process and stabilization of pH [1] . The aim of this work is to show these features of the ADVOS system by means of lactate elimination, pH stabilization and bilirubin clearance in an ex vivo model for metabolic acidosis and comparing them with a normal renal dialysis machine (NIKKISO DBB-03).",

To determine the maximum lactate addition and removal, lactic acid infusion was progressively increased until blood pH was out of physiological ranges. Once the maximum addition was determined, tests were repeated with the NIKKISO machine using a BF of 400 ml/min. Lactate, pH and bilirubin levels were analyzed pre-and post-dialyzer every 15 minutes.

Worldwide, most ICU-infections are caused by ESKAPE pathogens, whose high rates of antibiotic resistance are an active threat to public health.MethodsA retrospective, cross-sectional analytical study was conducted, including all patients admitted to this ICU during 2014. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0, Graph Pad Prism 6, and Open Epi 3.01. Results 150 cases were evaluated. The average age in the non-infectious, ESKAPE and non-ESKAPE cases was homogenous (Kruskal-Wallis Test, p = 0.053). 54% of cases were infectious. 13.3% of cases were ESKAPE cases. 46.4% (n = 26) of cultures isolated ESKAPE pathogens. Of these, Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common (50%). The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were ceftriaxone, imipenem and vancomycin, reporting resistance in 83%, 56.7% and 11.1% of the cultures respectively. 86.5% (n = 32) of the cases with pneumonia were associated with the use of endotracheal tube (ETT) (Xi 2 Test, p = 0.0005). The cases with mechanical ventilation presented pneumonia 5.2 times more frequently than cases without it (OR 5.2, IC 95%, 1.9-14.4). 53% (n = 17) of the cases with pneumonia and ETT were caused by ESKAPE pathogens (p = 0.0711). 11.5% (n = 16) of the cases with UTI had a urinary catheter, and 2.8% were caused by an ESKAPE pathogen. The average ICU stay was 7.8 days, 4.9 days for the noninfectious cases, 7.3 days for the non-ESKAPE cases, and 19.5 days for the ESKAPE-cases (Kruskal-Wallis Test p < 0.0001). A moderate positive correlation between the days of mechanical ventilation and days of stay in ICU was established (Pearson r 0.59, p < 0.0001). The mortality rate was 45% in ESKAPE cases and 49% in non-ESKAPE cases. The infectious cases were lethal 3 times more frequently than the non-infectious cases (OR 3.052, IC 95%, 1.512-6.33). Conclusions Almost half of the cultures isolated ESKAPE pathogens. Ceftriaxone and Imipenem were most frequently prescribed antibiotics. Antibiograms reported high rates of resistance to these two antibiotics. All of the ESKAPE cases had at least two invasive devices. Pneumonia Introduction The incidence of Acinetobacter infections has steadily increased, and now lately, has become a major threat with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. Acinetobacter are notorious for their ability to spread amongst hospitalized patients. This study attempts to identify ICU care variables predictive of Acinetobacter sepsis. Methods In this case-control study, we extracted data from a prospectively collected ICU database on all patients admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis from 2010 to 2015. Identification data on all Acinetobacter isolates was obtained from the Section of Microbiology database. Patients with Acinetobacter sepsis were compared with control patients. The institutional Research Ethics Committee approved the protocol. Results 431 patients were studied, 43 (10%) developed Acinetobacter sepsis. Mean APACHE II score was 26 \u00b1 7.7; median procalcitonin level was 3.9 (IQR 1.1, 18.4). Mean age was 52.5 \u00b1 21.4 years with median ICU length of stay 6 (IQR 4.43) days. ICU mortality was 23% (99 patients) with mortality rate of patients with Acinetobacter sepsis at 60.5% (26 patients of 43). Patients who developed Acinetobacter sepsis had a mean SOFA score 14.1 \u00b1 3.7 with 46.5% in septic shock, 9% organ donors, and 7% post-solid organ transplant. Most common site of isolation was the respiratory tract, 34.6%, followed by bloodstream/line sepsis, 30.8%, 32.5% had a single site infected. Conclusions Acinetobacter sepsis remains a frequent and hazardous ICU acquisition with a higher risk imposed by continued vasoplegia and septicemia and protective effects from appropriate initial antibiotic coverage and limited sites involved.

In patients with severe pneumococcal CAP, we characterized prevalence, risk factors and clinical outcomes of ARDS. We prospectively enrolled adult patients admitted into a pulmonary intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were clustered based on ARDS occurrence, according to the Berlin definition. Characteristics, risk factors and outcomes were compared between groups.ResultsAmong 6439 patients with CAP, 1307 (20%) had pneumococcal CAP; of those, 282 (23%) patients were admitted to the ICU and 115 required ventilatory support (70%, invasive mechanical ventilation and 30% non-invasive mechanical ventilation). Thirty-six out of 115 (31%) ventilated patients met the Berlin ARDS criteria. ARDS was mild, moderate and severe in 36, 44 and 20% of the cases, respectively. Conclusions ARDS develops in a minor proportion of patients with pneumococcal CAP. Yet, ARDS highly increases mortality risks. Previous treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is the only ARDS protective factor.P413Ventilator-associated pneumonia: MDR Gram-negative bacteria and predictors of mortality D Adukauskiene 1 , A Ciginskiene 1 , A Dambrauskiene 2 , R Simoliuniene 3IntroductionThe aim of study was to evaluate antimicrobial resistance of Gramnegative bacteria (GNB) as pathogens of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and to determinate predictors of in-hospital mortality.MethodsRetrospective data analysis of patients treated in ICU with multidrugresistant strains of GNB as pathogens of VAP during 2015 was carried out.ResultsIn 77 VAP pts 98 multidrug-resistant strains of GNB were revealed: 37 (37.8%) of A. baumannii, 16 (16.3%) of Klebsiella spp., 11(11.2%) of Enterobacter spp., 10 (10.2%) of P. aeruginosa and others 24 (24.5%) as S. marcescens, Morganella spp., Citrobacter spp., E. coli, Proteus spp. In 34 (34.7%) of GNB strains multidrug-resistance (MDR), in 63 (64.3%) extensive drug-resistance (XDR) and in 1 (1%) pandrugresistance (PDR) was ascertained. MDR was found in 7 (63.6%) of Enterobacter spp. and 7 (70%) of P. aeruginosa (p < 0.001), XDR -in 36 (97.3%) of A. baumannii strains (p < 0.001). One (10%) of P. aeruginosa strains was found to be PDR. 37 (48%) pts with multidrugresistant pathogens of VAP have died. Statistical significant differences of survivors vs nonsurvivors were found in means of hospital-Conclusions A. baumannii and Klebsiella spp. were found to be predominating multidrug-resistant pathogens of VAP. 1/3 of all multidrug-resistant GNB of VAP were MDR and 3/5 were XDR. 2/3 of Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa strains were found to be MDR. A. baumannii strain were found to be exclusively of XDR type. In-hospital mortality of VAP was 48%. Longer hospitalisation prior of VAP, neutrophilosis, internal disease, co-infection, shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment were found to be associated with in-hospital mortality. Co-infection, shock and inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment were found to be significant predictors for in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with multidrug resistant GNB in VAP.",

Evaluation of new clinical criteria for this sepsis definition was not done so far in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic ability of new and old clinical criteria for sepsis in LMCs. Methods This is a secondary analysis of CERTAIN (Checklist for Early Recognition and Treatmentof Acute Illness and Injury) study data from 15 intensive care units (ICU) from LMC. We included adult patients with discharge diagnosis of infection. Data on admission SOFA were collected prospectively. The presence of SIRS was determinedfrom prospectively collected APACHE II data on admission. Association with mortality was explored using univariate logistic regression.ResultsBetween October 2013 and July 2016, out of 1398 eligible patients, 131 patients (9.4%) were included in the study with both SIRS and SOFA and a discharge diagnosis of infection. ConclusionsIn a sample of LMCs ICU patients with infection SOFA, but not SIRS sepsis criteria are predictive for 28 days mortality.",

However, animals initially treated with PRBC:FFP (n = 9) showed no such differences.ConclusionsIn a porcine model of complex THS the development of TIC appeared to be associated with the presence of impaired microcirculatory perfusion and initial treatment with 0.9% saline. Early administration of blood products appeared to attenuate TIC, even in the presence of tissue hypo-perfusion. Hypophosphatemia occurs in around 20% of patients in intensive care units (ICU), similar to the incidence at the QEUH. There is not a standardised phosphate (PO4) replacement calculation and current practice in the QEUH is to replace 40mmol of PO4 as standard. In 2013, a Dutch study concluded the following pharmacokinetic equation to be effective when used for individualising PO4 replacement: Dose(mmol) = (0.5* x weight(kg)) x (1.25&#450;plasma PO4(mmol/ L)) [1] *Volume of distribution (L/Kg) \u01c2 Target plasma PO4 (mmol/L) This study aims to assess the validity of this equation in our population.MethodsElectronic medical records were reviewed retrospectively to identify patients who received PO4 replacement from August to November 2016. Patient characteristics, PO4 dosing and levels were collected. The above equation was used to calculate a theoretical dose which was then compared to the actual dose administered.ResultsOf 200 patients reviewed, 40 received intravenous PO4. Using the calculation, 34 patients would have received lower doses than administered following current practice(Fig. 39). Of these, 19 had PO4 within the therapeutic range (0.7-1.4) post administration of 40mmol. The theoretical dose exceeded the actual dose in five cases. In total there were 51 PO4 administrations, 40 of which did not reach the target concentration of 1.25mmol/L defined in the equation. The remaining eleven achieved levels >1.25mmol/L; five of which the plasma concentration exceeded the upper limit of 1.4mmol/L. Using the information collected a new average volume of distribution (Vd) was calculated to be 1.2L/Kg.ConclusionsThe proposed pharmacokinetic equation for individualising PO4 replacement is not valid for QEUH ICU patients.

See text for description Legend : Factors associated with ICU mortalityMethodsWe performed a prospective single-center RCT of 83 patients who had GFR between 30-60 ml/min/1.73 m2. 42 patients received IV sodium bicarbonate plus NAC 1 hour before contrast and continued for 6 hours. 41 patients received IV sodium chloride plus NAC in the same manner. In both groups, NAC (1,200mg IV bolus before contrast injection then 1,200 mg orally twice daily for 24 hours) was administered. Primary outcome was the incidence of CIN. Hydration with sodium bicarbonate might be effective as sodium chloride for prevention of CIN in emergency situations. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is one of the most frequent aetiologies af hospital-acquired acute renal failure (ARF). Strategies to prevent CIN include the renal vasodilator theophylline and hydration with sodium bicarbonate (NaBic). A recent study demonstrated synergistic prophylactic effects of theophylline and NaBic. Nevertheless, considering the total volume load of 9mL/kg of NaBic 0.154 mmol/L and the potential pro-arrhythmic effects of 200mg theophylline, haemodynamic side effects cannot be ruled out. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of NaBic hydration and theophyl-line on haemodynamics in 22 ICU-patients with PiCCO-monitoring (Pulsion Medical Systems SE; Germany). Methods Patients undergoing an X-ray examination with parenteral contrast-medium (CM) received NaBic according the protocol by Merten et al. (3ml/kg/h for 1h before CM and 1ml/kg/h for 6h after CM) and 200mg of theophylline i.v. over 15min immediately before CM. PiCCO-measurements were performed immediately before (TPTD-1) and after 1h-pre-hydration (TPTD-2), after theophylline (TPTD-3), after CM (TPTD-4) and after the 6h-post-CM-hydration (TPTD-5). Primary endpoint: Comparison of last vs. first PiCCOmeasurement. Statistics: IBM SPSS 23. Results 22 CM-enhanced computed tomographies were performed. Comparison of the last (TPTD-5) to the 1st (TPTD-1) measurement demonstrated significant increases in global end-diastolic volume index GEDVI (817 \u00b1 270 vs. 765 \u00b1 229mL/m 2 ; p = 0.038), cardiac index CI (5.64 \u00b1 1.81 vs. 4.34 \u00b1 1.81 L/min/m 2 ; p = 0.020) and cardiac power index (0.87 \u00b1 0.37 vs. 0.79 \u00b1 0.38 W/m 2 ; p = 0.037). By contrast, SVRI (1254 \u00b1 607 vs. 1513 \u00b1 854 dyn*s*cm-5*m-2; p = 0.042) and pulmonary vascular permeability index PVPI (1.66 \u00b1 0.59 vs. 1.94 \u00b1 1.03; p = 0.009) significantly decreased (p = 0.009).CVP, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate HR, dPmax, extravascular lung water index, EVLWI and global ejection fraction GEF did not change. In none of the patients there was a change in heart rhythm. With regard to potential side effects of theophylline, we compared haemodynamics before (TPTD-2) and after theophylline application (TPTD-3). Theophylline application resulted in a moderate, but significant increases in heart rate (99 \u00b1 22 vs. 92 \u00b1 20/min; p < 0.001) and GEF (28.5 \u00b1 7.0 vs. 27.7 \u00b1 7.2%; p = 0.024).

Caution must be taken unless metabolic alkalosis can be severe and immediate filter replacement is mandatory to correct disturbances. Further analysis is necessary to understand causes of early reduced filter clearance. In citrate CVVH it has been established that a post-filter ionized Calcium (iCa) of below 1.4 mg/dL (0.35 mmol/L) is associated with a clinically significant and usable anticoagulant effect [1] , promoting circuit survival. However, recent studies have demonstrated the limitations of measurements of low iCa (including high variance) on standard apparatus [2] . As part of larger prospective randomized study conducted in critically ill patients with AKI, treated with citrate CVVH, citrate concentrations were measured post-filter and compared to post-filter iCa values to establish a functional, clinically applicable threshold for anticoagulation, utilizing post-filter citrate concentration (PfC) as marker instead of iCa. Methods After written, informed consent, randomization took place to low dose citrate (2.5 mmol/L blood flow in the filter) or high dose citrate (4.5 mmol/L) as anti-coagulant, targeting a post-filter iCa of resp. 1.3-1.6 mg/dL (0.325-0.4 mmol/L) and 0.8-1.1 mg/dL (0.2-0.275 mmol/L). After adjusting blood flow for patient weight, settings on the Prismaflex\u00ae were adjusted to ensure the citrate concentrations in the filter by adjusting pre-filter citrate buffer rates (Prismocitrate 18/0\u00ae) and to correct for predilution. By adjusting buffer rates post-filter (Prismocal B22\u00ae) accordingly, a total clearance of 30 ml/kg/h was ensured. To limit the effects of citrate accumulation, values for PfC were measured 1 hour after initiation of CVVH and compared to iCa. The same blood gas analyser was used in all measurements (ABL800 radiometer\u00ae) for iCa. Results 12 patients were included in the high citrate group, 12 in the low group. There were no differences between the 2 groups for gender, weight, age, or total and ionized calcium at initiation of CVVH. After 1 hour of CVVH, the median iCa in the high group was 1.13 mg/dL (IQR 0.35) vs.1.92 mg/dL (IQR 0.31) in the low group (p < 0.05). Median Pfc in high was 790 mg/L (IQR 89) vs. 512 mg/L (308) in low (p < 0.05). There was a strong inverse correlation between PfC and iCa (r = -0.641, p < 0.005).",
