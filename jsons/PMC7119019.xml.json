            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses containing a genome of \u223c30 kb and four structural proteins, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) (Siddell et al., 2005). The S protein regulates virus attachment to the receptor of the target host cell (Cavanagh, 1995); the E protein functions to assemble the virions and acts as an ion channel (Ruch and Machamer, 2012); the M protein, along with the E protein, plays a role in virus assembly and is involved in biosynthesis of new virus particles (Neuman et al., 2011); and the N protein forms the ribonucleoprotein complex with the virus RNA (Risco et al., 1996). The N protein is a multifunctional structural protein with distinct characteristics like enhancing transcription of the virus genome, associating with other proteins (M protein) during virion assembly, and inducing toxicity to the host cell by disrupting various cell activities (Berry et al., 2012; McBride et al., 2014). The N protein is the most conserved and stable protein among the CoV structural proteins; whereas, the S protein undergoes several drastic changes during virus infection. For instance, its large parts are cleaved during infection by cellular proteases and expose the receptors to activate viral attachment to the host (Fiscus, 1987; Wu et al., 2004a, 2004b; Maache et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2013). Additionally, the S protein is prone to mutations, especially in the amino acids associated with the spike protein-cell receptor interface, in order to overcome host immunity (Wu and Yan, 2005; Sui et al., 2014). In an interesting study, the N gene of the CoV was found to be more effective for evaluating the codon usage bias than the S gene (Ahn et al., 2009). Studies reported that the N protein produced from prokaryotes has been used to generate specific antibodies against various animal coronaviruses including SARS (Loa et al., 2004; Timani et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2004a, 2004b; Blanchard et al., 2011). The recombinant antigenic N protein from hCoV OC43 used against the rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for hCoV OC43 and did not crossreact with other coronaviruses (SARS CoV and hCoV 229E) (Liang et al., 2013). Moreover, it was tested in different aged human serum samples and exhibited strong reactivity due to the effective central portion (174\u2013300 amino acids) of the N protein followed by C (301\u2013448) & N (1\u2013173) terminal portions (Lee et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2013). Hence the N protein functions as a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for hCoV OC43 (Di et al., 2005; He et al., 2005) and it has been further useful in the detection of SARS CoV infection (after the first day of infection) (Che et al., 2004). A similar study on SARS CoV N protein reported immunodominant regions N1 (1\u2013422 amino acids) and N3 (110\u2013422 amino acids) produced specific antigens in BALB/C mice and it reacted with the serum of SARS patients hence it can be used as effective SARS DNA vaccine (Dutta et al., 2008). The N protein of CoV expressed in recombinant raccoon poxvirus revealed an efficient vaccine against feline infectious peritonitis virus infection when administered subcutaneously (Wasmoen et al., 1995).",

There are 20 amino acids encoded by 61 codons which means that an amino acid could be coded by more than one codon. These alternative codons, up to 6 codons per amino acid, are known as synonymous codons (Nakamura et al., 2000). During gene to protein translation process, some synonymous codons are preferred over others. This is known as codon bias or codon usage bias. Viral genes and genomes exhibit varying numbers of synonymous codons depending on the host (Lloyd and Sharp, 1992). Additionally, codon usage in a virus is influenced by selection pressure and compositional constraints determined by the virus-host system (Karniychuk, 2016). Selective forces act on the gene sequences which maintain the codon bias and gene evolution (Ikemura, 1985; Sharp and Li, 1987; Sharp et al., 1993). Codon bias helpful in the analyzing the horizontal gene transfer as the key evolutionary force to study the molecular evolution of the genes (Doolittle, 1998; Ochman et al., 2000; Woese, 2002). Codon bias occurs during protein expression and it will be same in an organism\u2019s genes when there is a similar tRNA content (Kanaya et al., 2001) Codon bias influences the function of the protein and its translation efficiency (Chaney and Clark, 2015; Supek, 2016).",

Similarly, the amino acid Tyr encoded with UAC in MERS CoV while it overrepresented UAU in hCoV HKU1; Cys amino acid overbiased with UGC in pedCoV but UGU in other genes; Arg amino acid preferred CGU codon in pedCoV and CCoV while AGA dominated in others. Overall, among the NT3s of overrepresented or over biased codons, A3s and T3s dominated over C3s and G3s while in negative biased or underrepresented NT3s the order was G3s > C3s > A3s > T3s.",

As the codon number decreases for a particular amino acid, it results in decrease of ENc value indicating higher codon bias. Conversely, increase in codon number corresponds with less or little codon bias for an amino acid. The ENc values for all the studied CoVs ranged from 40.43 to 53.85 (Table 3\n). Generally, the estimated average ENc values of RNA viruses span from 38.9 to 58.3 (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003). High ENc values suggest that the CoVs genes are highly conserved along with effective replication, whereas the lowest ENc value i.e. 20 reflects codon usage with extreme bias (one amino acid is coded by a single codon). Our study observed 18 amino acids having different synonymous codons. Furthermore, the RNA viruses usually consist of high ENc values which help it in replication and host adaption with preferred codons.",

The used N gene sequences for pedCoV were obtained from a broad range of timescale covering from March 2007 to August 2017. In contrast, MERS CoV N gene sequences were from July 2014 to January 2018. This might have reflected on the rate of compositional variations and adaptation to the host. Therefore, pedCoV showed more attempts to adapt the host by changing its genomic composition. Since MERS CoV is still considered as the emerging virus, its genomic composition is still evolving and its host adaptation is still a matter of debate. Three of the viruses showed moderate or medium correlation i.e. cCoV, hCoV 229E and caCoV with the following r values: 0.35, -0.41 and -0.5 (negative correlation). The slopes of regression ranged from -0.8954 to 0.5891 in all the studied viruses represented in Fig. 2. Therefore, this reveals the directional mutational pressure and neutrality influenced them. The supplementary data file includes the AROMO and GRAVY analyses which revealed moderate correlations among the studied CoVs N genes and their varying significance levels likely due to ENc, GC3s, GC variations.

In the present work we assessed N gene of different CoVs with various factors such as natural selection, mutational selection and others to determine the codon bias and codon usage indices which regulate virion assembly and transcription of viral RNA in CoVs. The nucleotide contents revealed higher AT% and low GC% as it is common in RNA viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003; Gu et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005). The ENc values >35 indicates the slight codon bias due to mutation pressure or nucleotide compositional constraints. This suggests that the RNA viruses with high ENc values adapt to the host with various preferred codons (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003). The positively biased or represented codons of the present study are similar to the two other studies on MERS CoV proteases and pandemic influenza virus (H1N1 and in H3N2) (Kumar et al., 2016; Kandeel and Altaher, 2017). In zika virus and tembusu virus codon usage was driven by the mutation bias (Cristina et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015) while in Parvoviridae and pedCoV it was dominated by selection pressure (Shi et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014b). Some of the viruses observed with the codon bias related to their hosts during their adaptation (Chantawannakul and Cutler, 2008; Bahir et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2012; Kattoor et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015; Nasrullah et al., 2015). Studies directed at the conserved regions of viral proteins are useful for developing diagnostic reagents and probes for detecting a range of viruses and isolates in one test and for vaccine development (Du et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2019). In view of the lower mutation rates and relatively conserved sequences of the coronavirus (CoV) N gene, it would be ideal for studying these genes as an intermediary step in the development of vaccines and diagnostics for these viruses. The present study aids in the understanding of different factors influencing the variations of the N gene among various CoVs and their relationships with their hosts.",
