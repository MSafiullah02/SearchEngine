With the environmental variable of T, MRT, RH and wind v as its structure, it begins with a psychrometric analysis where the roles of temperature and humidity are denominated in PMV votes and the power needed to improve those votes. The role of humidity is critically reviewed with a case made for challenging the accepted norms an optimum RH range. Finally the efficacy of moving air is analysed in the different ways it can be employed.",

It is used as a tool to assist mechanical engineers in specifying the correct plant sizes to meet the anticipated space cooling requirements. It is common that the engineering tools and rules of thumbs already have a safety margin, in addition to which engineers typically load another margin (Houghton 1998) . Assumed in this approach is that there will not be any energy constraints placed in the life of the building and its equipment. It assumes that it is acceptable to over-engineer the mechanical ventilation system for that worst case scenario with the consolation that it can always be operated at partial load, even if that requires far more power than running a correctly sized plant at full load.",

Electricity is so scarce it only exists to run government-owned computers, and personal computers are pedal operated like an old-fashioned sewing machine. Energy is produced by the muscles of people or beasts of burden, then stored kinetically in either flywheels or springs to power factories, transport and weapons. What is realistic and sobering about Bacigalupi's future is the challenge he makes to many assumptions we take for granted: unlimited resource, continued global 3.

This is not new, the ISO 7730 standard mentions that ''typically a 10 % higher relative humidity is felt to be as warm as a 0.3\u00b0C rise in the operative temperature.'' There is however little meaning to compare %RH to T\u00b0C unless it can be denominated in terms of the energy embodied to drive the change. Based on the psychrometric analysis of a PMV response, reducing air temperature will drive a response far more significant than the reduction in humidity. So in terms of comfort energetics we can say that reducing temperature (15 W/vote) is 17 times more effective than reducing relative humidity (262 W/vote), and that an evaporative cooler is 100 times more effective in achieving comfort than an air-conditioner, even if the air-conditioner does not perform any dehumidifying function.",

These are used in outdoor and semi-outdoor settings with the common notion that they are unsuitable for indoor use because they increase the moisture ratio of indoor air. From the human thermal comfort point of view, this logic is flawed. If the indoors and outdoors were at the same temperature and the misting fans were merely saturating the air surrounding an occupant, then there is no psychrometric difference. If all environmental (T\u00b0C, RH%, MRT\u00b0C and v m/s) and personal variables (clo and met) were made equal to both indoor and outdoor conditions, the PMV will be identical. Likewise, the adaptive model will show that if the daily, or mean monthly T, were the same in both the in and outdoor, the ideal T will be the same. So strictly speaking, from the thermal comfort perspective, there should be no objection that would prejudice against the indoor operation of misting fans, an example being provided by gadget blogger Christen Costa (2012) . Low humidity is associated with higher evaporation rates of the skin. The operative parameter should be that of absolute humidity rather than relative humidity. In the earlier calculation, air at 30\u00b0C and 70 %RH had a dew point of 24\u00b0C. It should not be assumed that skin cannot dry in air at 100 %RH as the saturated vapour pressure of moist skin of 5.3 kPa (at 34\u00b0C) is still significantly higher than that of the air of 3.0 kPa (at 24\u00b0C). The vapour pressure difference will drive moisture from perspiration to evaporate and re-condense in the saturated air as steam, a phenomena similar to breathing out mist in cold weather.",

Dehumidification by cooling air past its dew point involved double the comfort energetics as compared to cooling without passing the dew point. In typical air-conditioning applications the dehumidified air is chilled so far below comfort it has to be reheated. Though this can be done with passive devices (e.g. Dinh heat pipes) it is common for the reheat cycle to be performed by electrical heaters, bringing the comfort energetics to 3-4 times that of cooling without dehumidification. High humidity is not contrary to thermal comfort. The ISO 7730 (2005) standard repeatedly states that whilst humidity affects comfort, its impact is minor.",

At high altitudes and in the absence of condensing nuclei, air can be supersaturated to 'several hundred per cent' (Battan 2003, p. 8) . Where condensing nuclei are present it will be correct to say that air cannot contain more moisture in the vapour state, yet still more moisture can still be accommodated as suspended droplets. For instance if one were to breathe outdoors on a cold morning when the air is saturated, one can observe a breath mist. In a similar condition if one were to go for a run, the profuse perspiration will evaporate, condense into suspended droplets, and appear as steam emerging from the hot skin. It is thus incorrect to think of saturated air being incapable of accommodating more moisture. The determining function is that as long as the saturated vapour pressure of skin was higher than the vapour pressure of air, perspiration can still evaporate.",

            "text": "After a half-century one wonders if new microbes have become more commonplace, or if these old strains of microbes have not long mutated to behave differently since they were tested. The dated research is also indicative that there is no modern evidence (in the last 20 years, based on the most recent of Brundrett's references) for RH as control mechanism for bacteria and viruses. It appears that the whole premise for the optimum RH range has not changed from trying to limit ''the life span of the broadest variety of bacteria and viruses'' (Brundrett 2008) , an approach first proposed by Sterling. This paper (Sterling et al. 1985) is here investigated in greater detail, not as a young researcher trying to be captious, but because it stands as such a significant document, and the only one offering a rationale behind the optimum RH range. Sterling's et al. (1985) paper ''Criteria for Human Exposure to Humidity in Occupied Buildings'' was a starting point to recommend a narrower range of 40-60 %RH. The then current ASHRAE Standard 55 (1981) did not actually stipulate an acceptable range of 20-90 %RH as Sterling suggested, but a 4.25-12 g/kg ratio, which within the limits of acceptable operative temperature could potentially vary from 20 to 90 %RH (Fig. 5.5) . Graphically, the acceptable range is bound by two (horizontal) limits in terms of humidity ratio lines of 4.25 and 12 g/kg, and so it is erroneous to interpret the standard as thinking the acceptable range is bound by (the curved) relative humidity lines of 20 and 90 %. The failure to distinguish the humidity units has, in my opinion, cascaded in a series of potentially flawed analyses.",

Evaporation rate is affected by absolute humidity (or humidity ratio, HR) not relative humidity (RH). To impede evaporative cooling takes the combination of both high RH and, more importantly, high T, a T that well exceeds normal room temperatures. We labour this point again because this paper presents a common misconception: that high RH is a health hazard. The condition that causes heat related injuries is primarily that of high temperatures. Whilst high RH can exacerbate the condition, it is not the primary cause of these injuries, and one can as easily, if not more easily, succumb to heat stroke in the hot-arid desert as in a hothumid forest. It is temperature, radiant temperature in particular, that is the key factor in ''heat exhaustion or heat stroke and possible death'' and not RH.",

            "text": "On closer inspection of Sterling's et al. (1985) graphical presentation, a number of concerns can be raised: 1. The term ''humidity'' is used very loosely. Of interest to the issue of RH should be that of gaseous atmospheric humidity. However references are made to ''humidifying equipment'' where it is water in liquid state that becomes a breeding site for bacteria. Control of RH is immaterial to the subsequent delivery of these contaminants in the misting aerosol. 2. The literature review is based on work done with airborne pathogens but the selection does not necessarily reflect a representative sample of the most common variants in the indoor environment. Salmonella and rhinovirus are, respectively, the most striking bacterium and virus missing. Uncommon viruses like polio and cowpox are included in the mix and their relevance is somewhat stretched. 3. It is unclear what is meant by ''effect'' which for microbes could possibly refer to the increase in colony forming units per cubic metre of air (i.e. cfu/m 3 ). Alternatively, it could even refer to absenteeism, occupants who complain of at least two SBS symptoms, perceived air quality, and an unending list of criteria. Without understanding the actual mechanics of each parameter it is impossible to plot wedges to indicate linear relationships between effect and RH%. 4. In many instances the relationships are non-linear to RH%. Different species of viruses also behave differently: influenza and vaccinia decrease in viability at increasing RH whereas results for poliomyelitis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis showed the opposite tendency (Harper, 1961 in Kowalski 2005 . One can as easily argue that 50 %RH is the ideal condition for limiting, as it is for promoting, respective strains of virus. 5. The graphical presentation gives the impression that at certain point in the RH scale, there are no deleterious effects. A casual observer will not realise that the author of the paper admits, '\u2026there is probably no level of humidity at which some biological or chemical factor that affects health negatively does not flourish' (p. 615). 6. Many other parameters come into play to influence the 'effect'. For example the termination of microbes from desiccation is affected by ''the initial moisture content, growth phase, rate of drying, relative humidity or composition of the surrounding medium, temperature, the coincident presence of sunlight, and other factors'' (Kowalski 2005 p. 113) . No mention has been made if these conditions have been kept constant to isolate RH % as the determining factor in the review of literature. 7. An impression is given that all the listed contaminants should be controlled for good IAQ. However, whilst 'viruses are almost exclusively communicable', fungal spores, on the other hand, 'are almost exclusively noncommunicable' and come 'mainly from the outdoor environment' (Kowalski 2005 p. 4 ).",

''Viruses may not behave the same as bacteria in terms of their susceptibility to variations in relative humidity. Low humidities appear to have a limited effect on virus viability while high humidities appear to decrease viability.'' (Kowalski 2005, p. 113) . Figure 5 .6 shows a graph where the survival of influenza is plotted against relative humidity at several sample times. ''The pattern is clearly a decrease in viability at increasing relative humidity.'' (Kowalski 2005, p. 113) Besides direct contact, the main mode of transmission of communicable diseases is through large droplets [10 lm and droplet nuclei \\10 lm (ASHRAE 2009). 'The residue of the droplet after evaporation, which contains any organism originally present, is called a droplet nucleus. It is typically 5 lm or smaller in size' (Rural Infection Control Practice Group, 2008, Sect. 2.1). At 50 %RH, a droplet of distilled water of 3 lm can be reduced to a tenth of its original size in a fraction of a second (Dunklin and Puck 1948) . Figure 5 .7 shows that RH has an impact on the initial evaporation rates, with droplets evaporating about four times faster at 0 %RH than at 70 %RH. However, droplets which contain bacteria do not evaporate completely, and despite similar initial evaporation rates, droplets with bacteria retain the nuclei for much longer that those without. The authors of this graph observed: (Clarke et al. 1999 , in Kowalski 2005 the graph shows how droplet-contained bacteria might not appreciably affect droplet evaporation until almost all of the droplet water had evaporated and the agglomerated bacteria or droplet nuclei were left. At this point the survival of the agglomerated bacteria might depend on such unknowns as the water evaporation rate, the position in the agglomerate, and the life-sustaining water content of the bacteria. (Lighthart and Kim 1989, p. 2351) They suggest that the following mechanisms are involved with this phenomena: \u2026it is hypothesized that as droplet water evaporates, cells, which are thought to have a lower water vapor pressure (e.g., due to lipid-containing cell membranes), may be present in the droplet air-water film, lowering the overall droplet evaporation rate. Carrying the argument further, it is hypothesized that as the cells agglomerate or form a protective shell configuration during evaporation, the outermost cells would dry to a critical (life-sustaining) water content before those cells deeper in the agglomerate do. From this, it might be expected that those relatively large droplets that originate with the most microbes would contain at least one deeply embedded viable microorganism for the longest period of transport time downwind. Thus, the larger droplet nuclei presumably will have more surviving microbes over a longer time. (Lighthart and Kim 1989, p. 2354) Evaporation of these agglomerated droplets under typical room conditions is not immediate enough to control disease spread and the most effective way of removing these droplets or droplet nuclei is by filtration. Filtration, however, is significantly affected by RH. Below 80 %RH, air filters led to a marked reduction of airborne bacteria concentrations by approximately 70 %. Above 80 %RH, a proliferation of bacteria on air filters resulted in a subsequent release back into the Fig. 5 .7 Simulated water evaporation from bacteria containing 600 lm diameter water droplets in an atmosphere of 0 %RH or 70 %RH and 25\u00b0C (Lighthart and Kim 1989) filtered air (Kowalski 2005, p. 225) . Hence where air filters are used, care must be exercised to control the subsequent re-entry of bacteria into the air stream at [80 %RH.",

To control mites it would be far more effective to deal with them in their habitats by vacuuming, chemical sanitisation, extreme heat or cold, or simply regular replacement of items like pillows. Sterling et al. (1985) Sterling's work was for its time a significant contribution, and the optimum RH recommendation was based on tenable ideas. We must however recognise that this was a literature review and not basic research involving testing the contaminants, particularly the biological ones, with the specific intent of determining their viability under varying ambient RH conditions. After a quarter of a century, huge advancements have been made in microbiology, with potential epidemics like SARS and avian flu fuelling very active research into the area. It is needful that this work be Equation notes P Vapour pressure of water in the substance P o Vapour pressure of pure water at the same temperature 5.3 Comfort Energetics updated, if possible. As the sole reference in the ASHRAE Handbook and AIRAH Guide, and on which other standards and legal requirements are based, the limitations to our knowledge of such an optimum RH should be openly acknowledged. The problem is that microbiologists themselves recognise that 'the effects of relative humidity on airborne microbes are complex and involve phase changes at the molecular level' (Kowalski 2005, p. 157) . With so many aspects of aerobiological behaviour not fully understood it is no wonder that in the ASHRAE Position Document on Airborne Infectious Diseases, the only mention of humidity is that humidity affects survival of the infectious agent although not always in predictable ways. (ASHRAE 2009, p. 5) Controlling RH% in today's context is, without doubt, a blunt and energetically costly way of controlling microbes, and for some viruses it is of questionable efficacy. There can be many other ways of controlling each factor that affects IAQ as tabulated in Table 5 .8.",

In this scenario it is assumed that the occupants will sit in the region where the fan speed is about 1 m/s (Rohles 1983, figure) . The moving air across a lightly clothed occupant will cause a difference in temperature (dT) from the forced convection. Various models exist (Emmanuel 2005, p. 69) to determine the magnitude of the dT. At 1 m/s the average of these eight models is dT = -3.89\u00b0C (s.d. = 1.69 m/s) in agreement with the difference in equivalent temperature of 3.3\u00b0C when ceiling fans are compared to still air (Rohles 1983) .

Whilst low-power fans can use far less energy than air-conditioning to ASHRAE standards, it is unlikely, at this stage, to provide an acceptable solution in Singaporean office buildings. It is acknowledged that this may be a disheartening conclusion unless there are mechanisms to change behaviour, an endeavour not within the scope of this thesis.",
