They appear to be part of the physiological pharyngeal flora in one\u2010third of the feline population (Randolph and others 1993) and have been isolated from the conjunctiva, upper respiratory tract and urogenital tract in this species (Heyward and others 1969, 1979). They cannot be classified as completely benign as they have been isolated in conjunction with lower respiratory tract infections and conjunctivis (Campbell and others 1973, 1998, 2004a, 2004b). Mycoplasma felis and Mycoplasma gateae are the species most often found in clinically affected animals. An extensive literature search revealed two reports describing Mycoplasma polyarthritis in cats (Moise and others 1985, 1983). In the current case M felis was found in the elbow joint of one cat and in the tarsal joint of another with painful septic monoarthritis. Surgical treatment and medication of the patients with doxycycline (Vibramycin; Pfizer) resulted in resolution of the disorder.",

Prescott (2000) recommended that the doxycycline be given in two doses of 10 mg/kg orally, followed by 5 mg/kg orally. Antibiotics are not generally recommended to be injected intra\u2010articularly since this may provoke chemical synovitis. In order to keep the antibiotic level as high as possible in the affected joint, the high dose of 10 mg/kg was also continued for the maintenance therapy. The cat did not show any side effects during the administration period. For treatment of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy diltiazem (Dilzem; Goedecke), 8 mg orally twice daily was chosen because of its negative inotropic effect and positive lusitropic effect. The angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme inhibitor, 1\u00b725 mg benazepril hydrochloride (Fortekor; Novartis) orally once daily, was added to alleviate the effects of the secondary mitral valve insufficiency by reducing cardiac pre\u2010 and afterload.",
