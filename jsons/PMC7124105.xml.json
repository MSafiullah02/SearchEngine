The ethanol/H2O/acetylacetone solution (0.1 mol ethanol, 0.02 mol deionized water, 0.01 mol acetylacetone) was added to the Ti(OC4H9)4/ethanol solution under stirring in ice incubation, then the mixture was stirred for 2 h. The TiO2 sol was matured for about 48 h before coating. TiO2 thin films were coated on titanium plate by the sol\u2013gel spin-coating method with a rotating speed of 2,000 rpm. The resulting films were subjected to heat treatment at 200\u00b0C for 15 min. By repeating this process, TiO2 thin films with different thicknesses were obtained. Finally, the films were annealed at 500\u00b0C for 3 h in air for crystallization. The crystal structure and thickness of TiO2 film were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 15.1) [3].\n",

The SEM images and XRD suggested that the crystallinity and growth of AgNPs were improved by increasing the annealing temperature. Furthermore, the morphology of the AgNPs/TiO2 composite film could be controlled by simply tuning the molar ratio of the silver nitrate, implying the morphology of composite film became rougher and rougher with the increase in the concentration of silver nitrate, while the diameter of AgNPs decreased. When the molar ratio of Ti4+ to Ag+ reached 5:1, the composite films were mesoporous. However, the AgNPs attached to the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles by forming Ag-O-Ti bonds, rather than entering the lattice of the TiO2 anatase phase [6].",

The commercial polyimide (PI) film was functionalized by simply dipping the film into dopamine (DOPA) aqueous solution for a period of time. Poly (dopamine) was deposited on the surface of PI films and formed PI-DOPA films. Then, PI\u2013DOPA films were immersed into an aqueous silver nitrate solution and subjected to UV irradiation in a self-made photochemical reactor for 15 min. The PI-DOPA films deposited with silver were washed thoroughly with doubly distilled water and then dried in a vacuum oven. The distribution and size of the silver nanoparticles could be controlled by changing the reaction time. In the SEM images of films, the surface of PI-DOPA film was much rougher than that of the pristine PI film (Fig. 15.2), resulting from the formation of the distinctive poly (dopamine) layer on the PI film, which facilitated the interlocking with the reduced silver nanoparticles. The silver nanoparticles with the diameter of ~20 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface of PI-DOPA film (Fig. 15.2).\n",

Deposition of MWNTs from a 5-mL solution was achieved by vacuum filtration through the PTFE membrane (5 \u03bcm pore size; Omnipore filters) to attain a loading of 0.27 mg/cm2 MWNTs on the base filter. The filter was rinsed with 50 mL of ethanol followed by 50 mL of deionized water to remove residual DMSO. And the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) filter was made from the suspension with the concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. The MWNTs-SWNTs hybrid filter was made by deposition of SWNTs on the MWNTs filter. As shown in Fig. 15.4, the surface of the MWNTs-SWNTs filter appeared similar to that of the SWNTs filter, and both filters showed increased bundling of the SWNTs in comparison with the MWNTs filter.\n",

The precursor for TiO2 film growth was titanium tetraisopropoxide (7.79 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol/min), transported to the reactor by N2 via a bubbler. The substrate temperature for growth was set to 500\u00b0C. The CuO films were grown using an atmospheric pressure flame-assisted CVD coater with a propane/oxygen flame, previously described in detail [19]. The substrate temperature was set at 400\u00b0C. An aqueous solution of 0.5 M Cu(NO3)2 was nebulized into a carrier of N2, through the flame and onto the substrate. The resulting films were shown to be polycrystalline. The XRD and AFM studies demonstrated that both growth of TiO2 above and below CuO film was in the form of anatase, and CuO film deposited above the TiO2 film was in the form of copper II oxide, and Cu I oxide when CuO film was deposited on the TiO2 film with over 61 nm thickness. Furthermore, CuO film deposited over TiO2 film by FACVD consisted of an island growth-type structure of packed spherical nanoparticles, with size of ~100 nm (Fig. 15.7a), which was very similar in appearance to that of a single TiO2 layer (Fig. 15.7d), rather than that of a single CuO film (Fig. 15.7c), suggesting the CuO film deposition was very much influenced by the underlying structure, in this case the change from amorphous smooth silica to crystalline titania. However, the TiO2 film over thick CuO film had a much more pronounced particulate structure than the other surfaces, due to the existence of Cu2O within this TiO2 film (Fig. 15.7b).\n",

In a typical experiment, bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and washed three times with physiological saline solution. The cells were resuspended in a 1:500 dilution of Nutrient Broth and adjusted to OD 0.1 ~ 0.2 at 600 nm in a spectrophotometer to give approximately 2 \u00d7 108 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter. In the BS ISO 27447:2009 method, 50 \u03bcL of cells suspension was inoculated onto each 20-mm2 test sample and covered with a square of 1-mm2 borosilicate glass to ensure close contact between the culture and the film. The samples were placed in 50-mm-diameter Petri dishes containing moistened filter paper to prevent drying out of the suspensions. The samples were irradiated with Blacklight Blue lamps with a maximum UV light intensity of 0.26 mW/cm2. Plain borosilicate glass was used for a control experiment. Samples were removed after incubation time and immersed in 20 mL of sterile physiological saline solution, following vortexed for 60 s to resuspend the bacteria. The viability count was performed by serial dilution and plating on nutrient agar in triplicate and incubation at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. However, in the house standard method, the cells were resuspended in sterile water, and the samples were not covered with glass, but incubated in 55-mm-diameter Petri dishes kept humid by adding 2 mL sterile water under UVA lamp irradiation of 2.24 mW/cm2. They found the control experiment remained viable after 24 h irradiation with only a 1-log reduction, while there was a 2-log reduction in the house standard method after 6 h irradiation. This difference could be attributed to the low concentration of Nutrient Broth in the resuspension medium in the BS ISO 27447:2009 method which meant that the bacterial cells were less stressed and remained viable for longer. Also, the number of the viable cells in the BS ISO 27447:2009 method was much larger that of the viable cells in the house standard method, owing to the reduced illumination levels by approximately tenfold, and the existence of oxidizable material in the resuspension medium (1/500 dilution of Nutrient Broth rather than distilled water) competing with the bacteria for reactive oxygen species (ROS).",

And the TiO2 film in the dark did not affect the survival ratio, indicating that the film itself was not toxic for E. coli, which was also demonstrated by Sunada et al. [29]: when the initial cell concentration was 2 \u00d7 105 CFU/mL (Fig. 15.8b), bacterial cells on the TiO2 film was killed within only ~90 min under the UV light illumination (1.0 mW/cm2). And they emphasized that the survival curve did not follow a simple single exponential decay process with the increasing of illumination time, but appeared to consist of two steps, a very low rate photokilling step, followed by a higher one, which was observed regardless of the initial cell concentration in the range of 2 \u00d7 105\u20132 \u00d7 108. In the case of an initial cell concentration of 2 \u00d7 105 CFU/mL, the rate constants of the first and second steps were 0.015 and 0.085 min\u22121, respectively, which was close to those obtained in the powder systems [35, 36].

[31] reported photocatalytic hydrogen generation using a TiO2 nanoparticle/MWNTs nanocomposite under visible light irradiation, which suggests that the photocatalytic activity of the MWNTs-doped TiO2 nanoparticle was excited by visible light irradiation, rather than UV irradiation. Akhavan et al. [41] and Oh et al. [42] have shown that the MWNTs/TiO2 nanocomposite could inactivate bacteria under the visible light irradiation and in the dark. Further, Akhavan et al. [32] tested the antibacterial property of MWNTs-doped TiO2 film by varying the content of MWNTs and the post-annealing temperature. They found that the antibacterial activity of the MWNT-doped TiO2 films in the dark gradually increased by increasing the MWNTs content of the films, independent from the post-annealing temperature (Fig. 15.18a). Especially, when the MWNTs contain reached 20 wt%, the MWNTs-doped TiO2 films annealed at 450\u00b0C showing an ability of complete inactivation of the bacteria under the visible light irradiation for 1 h, while the corresponding film annealed at 100\u00b0C could kill 93% of the bacteria under the same conditions.",

Narayan et al. [68] showed that nanotube films formed via high temperature laser ablation of graphite on silicon completely inhibited bacterial colony formation. However, the nanotube structure was not well controlled and the process may not be amenable to many biomedical materials. Kang et al. [69], Rodrigues et al. [70] and Brady-Est\u00e9vez et al. [71] tested the antibacterial activity of SWNTs filter against E. coli, showing inactivation of ~80% of E. coli after only 20 min incubation (Fig. 15.12) [71]. And then Kang et al. [69, 72] has revealed that the SWNTs filter presented higher antimicrobial activity than a MWNTs-coated filter, and the SWNT-coated filter could inactivate >60% of microorganisms in river water and wastewater treatment plant samples, while natural organic matter did not influence its antimicrobial activity [72]. Brady-Est\u00e9vez et al. [14] prepared a novel SWNTsMWNTs hybrid filter which was composed of a thin SWNTs layer on top of a thicker MWNTs layer supported by the PTFE membrane, and found that the hybrid filter not only exhibited high log removal of several model viruses (MS2, PRD1, T4) by depth filtration but also provided high levels of inactivation of model bacteria (E. coli K12 and Staphylococcus epidermidis), as well as microbes from river water and treated wastewater effluent.\n",

[76] prepared a flexible composite film by depositing SWNTs coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine (PVPI) in water, and found that the PVPI-coated SWNTs film could slowly release antiseptic iodine, resulting in the effective antibacterial property over 48 h incubation. Aslan et al. [77] found that E. coli and S. epidermidis viability and metabolic activity were significantly diminished on the SWNTs/polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) film, and were correlated with SWNTs length and concentration (<2 wt%). Schiffman et al. [15] observed that the loss of viability of E. coli on the electrospun polysulphone/SWNTs mats was directly correlated to increased SWNTs incorporation within the mat, ranging from 18% for 0.1 wt% SWNTs to 76% for 1.0 wt% SWNTs, and the antimicrobial action of the polysulphone/SWNTs mats occurred after a short contact time of 15 min or less. Pangule et al. [78] incorporated conjugates of MWNTs with lysostaphin (Fig. 15.13a), a cell wall degrading enzyme, into films to impart bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and S. epidermidis, and found that these enzyme\u2013MWNTs films were highly efficient in killing MRSA (>99% within 2 h) without release of the enzyme into solution (Fig. 15.13b), and these films were reusable and stable under dry storage conditions for a month (Fig. 15.13c). Zhou and Qi [79] synthesized a novel epilson\u2013polylysine\u2013MWNTs nanocomposite by covalent attachment of epilson-polylysine on MWNTs with hexamethylene diisocyanate as the coupling agent, and found that the epilson\u2013polylysine\u2013MWNTs film showed improved antibacterial activities and excellent anti-adhesive efficacy against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.\n",

They found the survival ratio of bacteria on the film surface improved with the increase in both mannitol concentration and pH value which could suppress the activity of radical molecules (\u2022OH and \u2022O2\u2212), and that the existence of catalase in the suspension could enhance the bacterial survival ratio, suggesting the formation of radical molecules and H2O2 in the suspension under the UV illumination.

[29] studied the photokilling process of E. coli on the TiO2 film by means of AFM, which suggested that bacterial cells decomposed from the outside of the cell, resulting from the TiO2 film photocatalysis (Fig. 15.15a\u2013c). Additionally, K\u00fchn et al. [91] observed that the killing rates of bacteria were dependent on the thickness and structure of cell walls. Based on these observations, they found that the photokilling of bacteria on the illuminated TiO2 surface could be divided into three stages (Fig. 15.15d). First, disordering of the outer membrane of bacterial cells by reactive species (\u2022OH, \u2022O2\u2212, H2O2). The outer membranes of E. coli cells were decomposed partially by the reactive species produced by the TiO2 photocatalyst, while the bacteria cell viability was not lost very efficiently. Second, disordering of the inner membrane (the cytoplasmic membrane) and killing of the cell. Owing to the change of the permeability to reactive species when the partial outer membrane was decomposed, reactive species easily reached and attacked the inner membrane, leading to the peroxidation of the membrane lipid. The structural and functional disordering of the cytoplasmic membrane due to lipid peroxidation led to the loss of cell viability and cell death. And third, decomposition of the dead cell. If the illumination continued for a sufficiently long time, the dead cells were found to be decomposed completely.\n",

[40] surmised a possible mechanism of the enhanced antibacterial activity of CuO-doped TiO2 film, which was associated with photocatalysis under the weak UV illumination (Fig. 15.16). Through a series of photoreactions as expressed above, reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as \u2022OH, \u2022O2\u2212 and H2O2, were generated by TiO2 photo-excitation on the CuO-doped TiO2 film surface. Because H2O2 was more stable than \u2022OH and \u2022O2\u2212, it could diffuse from the CuO-doped TiO2 film surface into the suspension. As shown in Fig. 15.16a, a small amount of copper ion could leach out of the CuO-doped TiO2 solid phase into the suspension and was reduced into Cu + by receiving electrons from photo-excited TiO2 nanoparticles. Then, the free Cu + reacted with H2O2 to produce \u2022OH via Fenton-type reactions, contributing to the deactivation of microbial cells in the suspension. On the other hand, the following reactions are supposed to occur in solid phase (CuO-doped TiO2 film) (Fig. 15.16b). Cu2+ could be reduced into Cu + by electron from photo-excited TiO2, and in turn Cu + converted H2O2 into \u010bOH, while being oxidized into Cu2+ again, leading to much more deactivated bacterial cells. However, Sunada et al. [30] proposed that copper ions could penetrate the damaged membrane into cytoplasm, resulting in a direct disturbance in intracellular metabolic systems, and thus the bactericidal process for the bacterial cells on the CuO-doped TiO2 film under weak UV illumination consisted of two steps (Fig. 15.17). First, the outer membrane was attacked by the reactive oxygen species produced by TiO2 photocatalysis and the transformation between Cu2+ and Cu+ (Fig. 15.17b, c). And then copper ions (maybe and Cu+) were effectively taken into the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 15.17c, e). In this case, the photocatalytic reaction mainly played a critical role in assisting the intrusion of copper ions into the cells.\n\n",

[42] considered that the improved antibacterial property of the MWNTs-doped TiO2 film could be assigned to the formation of Ti\u2013C and Ti\u2013O\u2013C carbonaceous bonds at 450\u00b0C, which was confirmed by the their XPS results. So a possible mechanism of the improvement in the photo-inactivation was proposed (Fig. 15.18b). First, the electrons generated by the photo-excited MWNTs were transmitted to the conduction band of the TiO2 through the Ti\u2013C bonds, leading to the formation of the positively charged MWNTs, which could capture electrons from the valence band of TiO2 to generate the holes in the TiO2 [101, 102]. And the electrons and holes induced the generation of ROS by a series of reactions as above described. And second, the formation of the heterojunction between TiO2 and MWNTs resulted in giving rise to a charge space near the junction to equalize Fermi levels, ranging from several tens to hundreds of nanometres. Not only was the band gap energy within the MWNTs-TiO2 heterojunction smaller than the band gap energy of the TiO2 located out of the junction but also a driving force originated from interior electric field of the charge space could separate the photo-generated pairs which resulted in reduction of the recombination rate of the pairs. Additionally, the natural bactericidal activity of MWNTs also contributed to this property in the dark.\n",

First, by induction of oxidative stress which led to interaction with proteins, DNA, and lipids causing death [108\u2013110]. In 1996, Sawai et al. [107] discovered that H2O2 was produced in ZnO slurry and the concentration of H2O2 was linearly proportional to the ZnO particles, which confirmed by Yamamoto et al. [111]. It is known that ZnO possesses photocatalytic activity under the UV light [112]. However, most of the antibacterial tests were done under the dark conditions, so it was still not clear how the ROS species were produced and how to improve the active oxygen production in the dark. Second, by membrane destruction due to accumulation of ZnO nanoparticles in the bacterial membrane and also their cellular internalization [113]. Zhang et al. [47] showed that the ZnO nanoparticles damages the membrane of the bacterial cells by the aid of TEM studies, and the electrochemical measurements via a model DOPC monolayer further confirmed the direct interaction between ZnO nanoparticles and the bacterial membrane. And third, by the release of Zn ions that may be responsible for antimicrobial activity by contracting with the membrane of microorganisms [114]. However, the toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles was not directly related to their entering into the cell, rather their intimate contact onto the cell causes changes in the microenvironment in the vicinity of the organism\u2013particle contact area to either increase metal solubilization or to generate ROS [115], which may ultimately damage the cell membrane [116].",

[51] demonstrated that silver ions were released over long periods from the film surface, even from TiO2-capped AuNPs and silver nanorods films (Fig. 15.19) [65]. Agarwal et al. [122] also found that localization of AgNPs on the AgNPs/poly (allylamine hydrochloride)/poly (acrylic acid) film generated the concentrations of silver ions required for antibacterial activity at the surface, without requiring the high loading of silver AgNPs. On the other hand, free AgNPs released from films could directly interact with the microorganism by disrupting/penetrating the cell envelope, and generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) [108, 109] that caused deadly damage. Moreover, free AgNPs preferentially attacked the respiratory chain, cell division finally leading to cell death [123, 124]. So, compared to silver ions, the effective concentration of AgNPs was ~103-fold lower, being at the nanomolar level [125]. In the AgNPs-based composite film, the improvement of antibacterial activity also partly arose from the action of the other components, such as AgNPs/TiO2 films [126] and AgNPs/ZnO film [127].\n",

The bacteria were deposited onto CNTs resulting in direct bacteria\u2013CNTs contact which could be mediated by the exposed CNTs surface area, bacteria concentration, and solution composition. Second, by perturbation of the cell membrane. The mechanism of this step could be clarified according to the toxicity of various classes of hydrocarbons against aquatic microorganisms [139]. The toxicity of hydrocarbons involved two parts: the nonspecific and specific toxicity. The nonspecific toxicity was the disruption of the cell membrane, and dependent on the hydrophobicity of hydrocarbon. And the specific toxicity was described as how the hydrocarbons affected membrane proton transport, disrupted specific proteins, or chemically oxidized biomolecules (i.e. proteins, lipids, and DNA), which was attributed to the electrophilicity of hydrocarbon [140, 141]. Furthermore, Kang et al. [73] demonstrated that the perturbation of cell membrane was related to diameter and hydrophobicity of CNTs, the intensity of the open tube ends. And third, by bacterial oxidation. The cell death resulted from the ROS oxidation and regulation of cellular metabolic pathway (Fig. 15.21). The ROS were generated by the cell membrane damage and the interactions between CNTs and biomolecules (e.g., GSH [75]).\n",

It has been reported that silver ions accumulated in epithelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and connective tissue [147, 148] and caused tissue toxicity and impaired wound healing [149, 150]. In vitro studies have also demonstrated that the concentrations of silver released from AgNPs-based film could be cytotoxic to mammalian cells involved in wound healing, including fibroblasts [151, 152], keratinocytes [151], and lymphocytes [153]. However, it was found that human osteoblast attached and grew well on the surface containing AgNPs [154, 155]. Agarwal et al. [122] employed molecularly thin polymeric films [poly (allylamine hydrochloride) and poly (acrylic acid)] prepared by layer-by-layer deposition to localize AgNPs on surfaces, and found that the resulting composite film could release silver ions, leading to antibacterial activity without cytotoxicity. Also, Zan et al. [63] considered that the high resistance of AgNPs/poly (vinyl alcohol)/ploy (L-lactic acid) film to HeLa cells is not due to the embedded AgNPs, but to its high water content, hydrophilicity, and low interfacial tension between the hydrogel surface and the surrounding fluids.",
