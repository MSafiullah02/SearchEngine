These symptoms result from a range of processes, including contraction of airway smooth muscle (ASM), airway inflammation, airway infections, immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic responses, exposure to pollutants, exercise, stress and the stimulation of cholinergic and sensory nerves 1 . A key feature of asthma is decreased lung function, measured as a reduction in either the peak expiratory flow (PEF) or the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ). Some of the immediate symptoms of asthma are reversed by a short-acting inhaled \u03b2 2 agonist, but longer-term control requires inhaled anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids.",

It is associated with onset early in life and is increasing in incidence in the developed world. An interesting aspect of asthma is its heterogeneous, complex nature and the fact that it can present as a chronic, stable disease and as asthma exacerbations. Asthma can be severe or mild, and can vary spontaneously in activity and greatly in terms of the time of onset or the response to therapy. Indeed, whether asthma is one disease or a spectrum of related but subtly different conditions is often debated 2 , and asthma has recently been divided into separate pheno types, which are in turn subdivided into several endotypes 3 (TABLE 1) . Asthma exacerbations are often triggered by multiple factors that may work in an additive or synergistic manner. This complex pathogenesis has made it challenging to understand the cellular mechanisms that are responsible for asthma, to decipher candidate genetic predispositions and to identify causative agents. The causes of asthma are multifactorial, and epidemiological studies spanning three decades across five continents have proved that there is a strong association between respiratory infections and the risk and pathogenesis of asthma.",

            "text": "Much evidence points to a relationship between severe lower respiratory infections with human respiratory syncytial virus (human RSV; referred to hereafter as RSV) or human rhinoviruses (RVs) early in life and the development of recurrent wheeze followed by asthma diagnosis in later childhood. RSV is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus of the Paramyxoviridae family. It is an important pathogen of young children (<2 years of age) and accounts for ~70% of severe infantile viral bronchiolitis cases 16 . Serological monitoring shows that RSV infects nearly all children in their first 2 years of life; however, only ~40% of children exhibit clinical signs of infection in the lower respiratory tract. For unknown reasons, some children with bronchiolitis develop recurrent respiratory symptoms. RVs are members of the family Picornaviridae, are composed of a positive-sense ssRNA genome of approximately 7.1-7.5 kb and can be grouped into the major and minor groups on the basis of their host receptors: major group viruses bind intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), whereas minor group viruses bind low-density-lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). RVs can also be classified into three groups on the basis of nucleotide sequence identity (RV-A, RV-B and RV-C). The recently proposed RV-C group viruses 17, 18 have unique sequences at the ICAM1-and LDLR-binding sites, suggesting that they use a different (but currently unknown) receptor 19 . It is estimated that there are more than 100 serotypes of RVs, meaning that multiple serotypes may infect an individual throughout the year 20 . Recent cohort studies suggest that lower respiratory infections by RVs are as important as infections by RSV in terms of the risk of later asthma development 21-23 . Whether these viruses are true causative agents of asthma or (owing to shared risk factors) simply act as markers for an increased risk of asthma development, or even whether both possibilities are true, is unclear and much debated. RSV-mediated bronchiolitis is clearly associated with later asthma development 24,25 , perhaps owing to an inappropriate or overexuberant immune response to the infection 26 . Although associations between RSV, wheeze and asthma development are evident, birth cohort studies have shown that 90% of nonatopic wheezers lose this phenotype at school age and have normal lung function, indicating that asthma and virus-induced wheeze may be distinct diseases 27 . The association of RSV with asthma is most clearly demonstrated in a long-term (18 years) study of a cohort of Swedish children. The most recent update from this study 28 reports that, compared with controls, children who have RSV-mediated bronchiolitis in infancy are more likely to be asthmatic at 18 years old (39% versus 9%), show increased sensitization to perennial allergens (41% versus 14%) and have striking persistent and recurrent wheeze (30% versus 1%). Children with a history of bronchiolitis have an enhanced interleukin-4 (IL-4) (that is, T helper 2 (T H 2) type) response to RSV and cat allergens, whereas controls have an equally strong interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) (that is, T H 1 type) response to RSV antigens 29 . However, it is not yet clear whether the inflammation caused by viruses causes long-term respiratory disease or is associated with wheeze and asthma diagnosis because of shared risk factors.",

More recently, palivizumab prophylaxis was shown to be associated with a similar substantial protection against recurrent wheeze in children aged 2-5 years 32 . Much debate has focused on which of these viruses are more important to asthma development, RSV or the RVs. The answer is likely to be complicated and may involve host genetics and susceptibility factors as well as the nature of the viruses themselves. It is possible that RSV and RVs contribute to asthma development in different ways. A recent study has shown that allergic sensitization precedes or is a risk factor for symptomatic infection with RVs, and both sensitization and RV infection are strongly correlated with the occurrence of asthma at 6 years of age 33 . By contrast, the role of RSV infection in this study seemed to be different, as sensitization did not increase the risk of infection in this cohort.",

Changes in the abundance and diversity of commensals can also affect subsequent infection by influenza viruses in mice 35 . The lower airway thus contains a characteristic microbiota that is quantitatively and qualitatively different in patients with stable asthma or COPD than in control subjects 34 .

The predicted and known allergens of A. fumigatus are diverse in nature and include secreted proteases, glucanases and cellulases. Recent work suggests that some A. fumigatus allergens are 'hidden' from the immune system; hydrophobin (RodA) is an immunologically inert surface protein on dormant conidia, and removal of RodA through chemical or genetic means produces conidia that are able to activate the immune system, potentially explaining why fungal species often do not evoke immune responses in healthy individuals 57 .",

A key feature of a microorganism in promoting asthma is the ability to induce lung inflammation, injury, or repair and remodelling. Many of the innate receptors that recognize respiratory fungi, viruses or bacteria, including TLRs, RIG-I-like helicases and NOD-like receptors, activate the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) family of transcription factors, which induce more than 100 pro-inflammatory and host response genes 74 . RSV and RVs induce a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules and mucins. Mucins cause mucous plugging of the airway and may provide a substrate for bacterial colonization, whereas cytokines facilitate cellular chemotaxis, and activation and proliferation of immune cells in the infected airway 45,75 . Microorganisms may damage and compromise the integrity of the airway by infecting airway epithelial cells, causing cell death 76 and shedding 77 .

Data suggesting that this does occur have been reported for C. pneumoniae 69 , but further studies are required to determine whether secondary bacterial infections commonly follow viral infections in asthma. Thus, by causing barrier disruption, viruses may initiate a cascade that, as described above, allows environmental bacteria better access to the underlying tissue (FIG. 4) .",

T H 2 cells are CD4 + T cells that produce a defined array of cytokines -classically, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 -and home to sites of inflammation. T H 2 cells are involved in defence against gastrointestinal nematodes and are also strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and asthma exacerbations. Case control studies show a clear link between respiratory virus infection together with allergen exposure in sensitized children 108 and adults 109 in increasing the risk of hospital admissions due to asthma exacerbations. Furthermore, experimental RV infection models have shown that patients with asthma have more severe lower respiratory tract symptoms and greater reductions in lung function than control patients, and have increases in bronchial hyper-reactivity 75 . Exacerbation severity is strongly correlated with both T H 2 type cytokine production from BAL CD4 + T cells and viral load. RV infection in mouse asthma models supports these observations, as RVs enhance T H 2 type cytokine production by sensitized mice that are simultaneously challenged with aeroallergen 62 . How viral infection can synergize with or act additively to T H 2 type immunity is shown in FIG. 5. Excessive T H 2 type responses are implicated in the pathogenesis of RSV-mediated bronchiolitis 110 , and increased production of IL-5 by T cells at birth is associated with a greater risk of severe respiratory infection 111 . Genetic associations also link polymorphisms in the T H 2 gene locus to severe RSV-mediated disease 112, 113 . Increased T H 2 type responses are reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and sputum preceding acute asthma exacerbations in vivo and also in mixed T H 1-T H 2 cell populations during acute exacerbations in vivo 114 . , CXCL5 (also known as ENA78) and CXCL8 (also known as IL-8)), and T helper 1 (T H 1) type chemokines (CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5; also known as RANTES), CXCL10 (also known as IP10) and CXCL11 (also known as ITAC)), and increases epithelial permeability. Neutrophils secrete several mediators that can contribute to inflammation and the integrity of the airway, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), elastase and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Epithelial cells normally express luminal CD200, which, when bound to its receptor, CD200R, on lumen macrophages, prevents the macrophage response to inflammatory stimuli. Lumen macrophages are normally inhibitory, as they produce transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), which inhibits inflammatory airway dendritic cells (DCs). A higher epithelial permeability or epithelial damage as a result of infection allows the unrestrained submucosal macrophages access to the allergen and to other stimuli, and this can promote overzealous inflammation. Submucosal macrophages and epithelial cells are triggered by exposure to bacteria or viruses (and their products) to produce interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which promote inflammation. ASM, airway smooth muscle; GM-CSF, granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor; IFN\u03b3, interferon-\u03b3; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; T H 1, T helper 1. also known as TARC), a chemokine that binds with high affinity to CC-chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), which is abundantly expressed on T H 2 cells. In mice, RSV was found to induce CCL17 production, and this finding was reinforced in a T H 2-biasing model in which mice were first vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing RSV major surface glycoprotein G and then infected with RSV 115 . In vitro, production of CCL17 by human BECs infected with human RSV requires the presence of T H 2 type cytokines and is associated with activation of both NF-\u03baB and STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) 115 . Recently, the signalling molecule endoplasmic reticulum IFN stimulator (ERIS; also known as TMEM173) has been shown to induce STAT6 activation in viral infections 116 , providing a potential mechanism for how viruses induce T H 2 type cytokines or chemokines. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a T H 2 cell-promoting cytokine that is produced by BECs and can be induced by both bacterial (TLR2 and TLR9 activating) and viral (TLR3 and TLR8 activating) ligands 117 . This cytokine matures the DC network and, in humans, enhances the cytolytic activity of CD8 + T cells and the production of T H 2 type cytokines, leading to enhanced airway hyper-reactivity. Furthermore, mast cells in the bronchial mucosa of patients with asthma express the TSLP receptor. Together with IL-1, supernatants from TLR2-activated airway epithelial cells induce mast cell production of IL-5 and IL-13, which have pivotal roles in the development and maintenance of asthma 117 . Both RV-and RSV-infected BECs produce TSLP. Human RSV-induced TSLP production stimulates DC expression of the T H 2-associated molecules CCL17 and OX40 ligand (OX40L; also known as TNFSF4) 118 . RV-induced TSLP production is synergistically enhanced by IL-4 (REF. 119 ). BECs from patients with asthma also produce higher levels of TSLP than BECs from healthy individuals when polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid stimulation is used as a surrogate for viral infection 120 . Thus, by producing TSLP in response to infection, the airway epithelium may orchestrate the pathophysiology of asthma.",

Natural killer cell-depleted mice exhibit enhanced T H 2 type airway inflammation following RSV infection.

IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate the production of IgE, which binds allergen, allowing crosslinking of IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils; this causes the release of mediators that have profound effects on airway inflammation and hyper-reactivity. Analysis of nasal secretions from RSV-infected infants revealed the presence of RSV-specific IgE, and IgE levels were found to positively correlate with wheeze and higher levels of histamine 122 , although these studies have been hard to replicate. In mice, primary RSV infection is usually dominated by T H 1 type effects but may induce IL-4 and IL-13 expression in the lungs as well as the production of RSV-specific IgE in serum under some conditions. Transfer of RSV-specific IgE to naive mice increases airway hyper-reactivity following RSV infection, an effect that is dependent on expression of high-affinity IgE receptor 123 . RSV infection in neonatal mice also induces T H 2 type cytokine-dependent RSV-specific IgE. Re-infection with RSV 5 weeks later induces a T H 2 cell-skewed immune response that is reduced in magnitude by IgE-specific antibody therapy 124 . A mechanism has been proposed to explain how IgE against a related paramyxovirus, Sendai virus (SeV), enhances T H 2 cell-associated airway disease in mice. This suggested mechanism involves infection-induced upregulation of high-affinity IgE receptor on conventional lung DCs. The authors speculate that the later appearance of SeV-specific IgE, after viral clearance, crosslinks IgE receptors (with viral antigen) on conventional DCs, stimulating the production of CCL28, which in turn recruits activated IL-13-producing T H 2 cells to the lung 125 .",

Deficiencies in the T H 1 type cytokines IFN\u03b3 and IL-12 in patients with asthma 75 also suggest that impaired host defence responses to bacteria are probably implicated.

There is now overwhelming evidence that asthma can be viewed as a chronic inflammatory condition which is initiated, triggered and maintained by the respiratory microbiota. Microorganisms have roles in the onset and development of asthma but can also be protective (the hygiene hypothesis). It is not yet clear whether some organisms (especially RSV) actually cause atopic disease or are instead associated with atopy because individuals who are prone to atopy suffer more from infantile bronchiolitis. Viruses undoubtedly cause most asthma exacerbations, but some non-viral pathogens may also play a part. Certain fungi and bacteria have diverse roles in driving the pathogenesis and increasing the severity of asthma, and various microorganisms play different parts in different asthma endophenotypes. More research is needed, but our ultimate goal is to identify microbial targets that are amenable to manipulation with vaccines or anti microbial drugs and thus to reduce the burden of asthma on society.",

Viruses infect epithelial cells, stimulating the release of T H 2 cell-promoting chemokines CC-chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) and CCL22, and cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25) and IL-33. The T H 2 type chemokines attract T H 2 cells into the airway, and these in turn secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. IL-5 promotes eosinophilia, and the resultant eosinophils release the inflammatory mediators major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), inducing inflammation in the airway smooth muscle (ASM). IL-4 and IL-13 cause antibody class switching to immunoglobulin E in B cells, so that B cells secrete allergen-specific IgE. This antibody then binds mast cells, and crosslinking of the allergen on mast cell-bound IgE causes mast cell degranulation and release of preformed mediators, including histamine, prostaglandin (PGD 2 ) and leukotrienes (LTC 4 , LTD 4 and LTE 4 ). These mediators cause bronchoconstriction and further airway inflammation. Mast cells also produce the T H 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, as well as other cytokines, including TGF\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), promoting further T H 2 type immune responses and inflammation.",
