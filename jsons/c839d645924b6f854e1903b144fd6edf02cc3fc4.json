NIV is applied in patients with a \"do not intubate\" order, as a palliative measure in terminally ill patients, to prevent extubation failure in patients with COPD or heart failure, for communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) in COPD patients, to prevent and treat postoperative respiratory failure, and to prevent ARF due to asthma. Also in this category, but with greater caution and according to the case, NIV may be indicated for severe CAP and for preventing extubation failure in patients without COPD. \u2022 Evidence level 3-derived from systematic reviews with homogeneity of casecontrol studies and an individual case-control study. NIV is suggested for neuromuscular diseases and kyphoscoliosis, partial obstruction of the upper airway, thoracic trauma, and treatment of ARF in patients with asthma. With more caution and strict surveillance, NIV may also be indicated for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). \u2022 Evidence level 4-derived from case series and poor-quality cohort and casecontrol studies. NIV is suggested for obesity-related hypoventilation, cystic fi brosis, and in the elderly (>75 years) with ARF. With greater caution and according to the case, it is also indicated for idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis.",

            "text": "Numerous RCTs have focused on NIV during the last decade. The studies, however, have reported confl icting evidence regarding any permanent benefi t for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). These confl icts probably arise because most of these studies are small, have many differences among them, and the success of NIV varies according to the cause of hypoxemic respiratory failure. For example, in the 2006 meta-analysis of Keenan et al. [ 2 ] , which included eight RCTs that had studied patients with AHRF secondary to causes other than ACPO, the NIV reduced the ETI rate by 23 %, the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) by 2 days, and ICU mortality by 17 % (absolute risk reduction). In contrast, in a 2008 observational study by Schettino et al. [ 3 ] that included 449 patients, of whom 144 underwent NIV for AHRF, unfavorable results were obtained. These authors found that 60 % of this population were in need of ETI, and the hospital mortality rate was 64 %.",

            "text": "Noninvasive ventilation has radically changed the treatment of AHRF, although its use in patients with severe CAP remains controversial (especially in the presence of ARDS). The controversy arises because NIV is associated with higher rates of treatment failure in patients with ARDS-related AHRF than in those with severe AHRF due to other factors. These data suggest that the effectiveness of NIV varies depending on the cause of the patient's AHRF. On the other hand, use of NIV with specifi c objectives and clear criteria, associated with knowledge of the ventilatory failure predictors to avoid delaying initiation of ETI, make this technique one of the best for patient with conditions such as immunosuppression, COPD, or heart failure. The selection and exclusion criteria or failure when using the technique are therefore of great relevance for therapeutic success or failure. As a guide, in 2007 the Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society [ 23 ] recommended ICU admission of patients with severe CAP based on their meeting one of the following major criteria: (1) ARF with IMV requirement and/or septic shock requiring vasopressors; or (2) three of the following criteria: respiratory rate \u2265 30 bpm, PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264 250, multilobar infi ltrates, confusional state, blood urea nitrogen \u2265 20 mg/dL, leukopenia (<4 \u00d7 10 9 /L), thrombocytopenia (<100 \u00d7 10 9 /L), hypothermia (<36 \u00b0C), hypotension requiring aggressive fl uid therapy.",
