SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even lifethreatening infection, known as COVID-19. Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs and, as such, global public authorities have so far relied upon non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-likeillness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources. The model is used to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 and the other respiratory pathogens in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season. Here, we show that increasing influenza vaccine uptake or enhancing the public health interventions would facilitate the management of respira-tests are characterized by a good specificity but have a limited sensitivity, as such not enabling a quick and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19. Altogether, this would significantly impact downstream public health efforts to properly identify COVID-19 cases and contain the outbreak, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission.",

Since it took time to increase the production of kits and improve the level of production technology, there was a serious shortage of detection kits during the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemics. To examine the impacts of the limited detection kits on the COVID-19 epidemics in terms of the cumulative number of confirmed cases, the cumulative number of cross-infected cases and 8 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the infected population (I(t)), we vary the increasing rate of the available detection kits r \u03c9 in Fig.4 . It follows from Fig.4 that reducing r \u03c9 will significantly increase both the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cross-infected cases, and the infected population of I(t) and daily cross-infected population at the peak time. Particularly, the cumulatively confirmed cases and cumulatively cross-infected cases will increase 3.5 times (about 2.084 \u00d7 10 5 cases) and 4.7 times (about 1.483\u00d710 4 cases), respectively, if the exponential increasing rate r \u03c9 decreases by 80 percent.

If r c increases by 5 times, the cumulative number of confirmed cases will decrease by 93.6%; 2). If r q increases by 5 times, the cumulative number of confirmed cases will decrease by 78.7%. In addition, comparing the results in Table 2 , we find that the impact of increasing r c or r q on mitigating the epidemics weakens as r \u03c9 increases.

However, we further observe that if we increase the rate of r \u03c9 by 5 times (the red curve in Fig.5(A) ), the effective reproduction number will decrease below the threshold 1 directly. This indicates that due to the limited resource of the testing kits, the fast-increased infected population will result in more infections as they are not confirmed and hospitalized. And the situation will become worse if r \u03c9 is smaller, shown in Fig.5(A) as well. Furthermore, it follows from Fig.5(B) and (C) that increasing r c or r q can avoid the magnification of the effective reproduction number and make the threshold value reduce to 1 ahead of time, which implies that reducing the contact rate quickly and increasing the quarantined rate can effectively avert the short-term intensification of the outbreak caused by the limited detection kits.",

As shown in Fig.6 , vaccination against influenza could reduce the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and cumulative cross-infected cases, hereafter referred as the 10 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reduced confirmed cases and reduced cross-infected cases, respectively. It follows from Fig.7(A 1 ) and (A 2 ) that getting vaccinated against influenza could significantly reduce the cumulative number of confirmed cases and crossinfected cases with respect to r \u03c9 . We give the specific reduction rate with respect to different r \u03c9 and vaccination rate in Table 3 . Specifically, when the vaccination coverage rate was 90%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cross-infected cases could reduce by 51.5% and 91.4% with r \u03c9 = 0.1\u00d7r 0 \u03c9 , respectively. We can further observe that the effects of getting vaccinated against influenza weakens as r \u03c9 increases. It means that getting vaccinated against influenza could effectively control the outbreak of COVID-19. Moreover, mass influenza vaccination is more necessary when detection kits are severely limited and under seriously shortage of supply. In another words, mass influenza vaccination can be a much more effective control measure in mitigating the COVID-19 epidemics in the early stage with a rapid growth and the countries or areas with limited testing kits.",

In the case of the implementation of a mass influenza vaccination campaign well before the onset of the influenza season, the exposure of emerging/re-emerging respiratory pathogens would be unmasked, facilitating their identification and the design of ad hoc public health interventions. This would significantly alleviate the pressure on health-care facilities, reducing the total number of people complaining of ILI symptoms, and decreasing the transmission probability of COVID-19 or other emerging infectious agents both among healthcare workers and, subsequently, among people under investigation for their disease.",
