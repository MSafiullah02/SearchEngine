HuNoV are mainly transmitted through the fecal-oral route (4). Although norovirus disease is usually short-lived and self-limiting, immunocompromised patients can become chronically infected, with symptoms lasting for weeks or years (5, 6). Despite significant efforts, HuNoV have yet to be cultured efficiently in the laboratory. However, our understanding of their biology has improved significantly in recent years (7, 8), and a recent study has demonstrated limited replication in immortalized B cells in the presence of enteric bacteria (9). Some of these advances have been due to the discovery of a murine norovirus (MNV), which can be cultivated in cell culture (10). Reverse-genetics approaches and small animal models for MNV have enabled better insights into the norovirus life cycle, including the identification of cellular factors and pathways involved in norovirus replication (11\u201314).",

            "text": "As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely heavily on the cellular pathways and processes for almost every step of their life cycle. RNA viruses typically have small genomes and therefore possess limited coding capacity. As a result, RNA viruses typically utilize numerous mechanisms to increase the information contained within their genomes. These mechanisms include the use of translational frameshifting and other novel translation mechanisms, as well as the incorporation of large polyproteins, which are processed to produce precursors, as well as the final mature protein products, each of which can have different functional properties (15, 16). In addition, the genomes of RNA viruses invariably fold to form RNA structures that interact with both cellular and viral proteins to regulate many aspects of the viral life cycle. These types of interactions are known to contribute to genome replication, translation, encapsidation, and pathogenesis (17\u201323). For example, a single nucleotide change in the poliovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) structure leads to the attenuation of virus in a cell-specific manner (24, 25), whereas the deletion of a polypyrimidine tract in the MNV 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) leads to attenuation of virus in vivo (26). The identification and inhibition of these viral RNA-host protein interactions have been shown to have the potential to control viral infections (27, 28). Targeting a host protein has the additional advantage of a high genetic barrier to drug resistance due to the extremely low mutational rate of eukaryotic cells. In contrast, RNA viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which lack proofreading capacity, leading to the generation of a mutant spectra referred to as \u201cquasispecies,\u201d greatly facilitating the emergence of drug resistance (29\u201331).",

Given the multifunctional nature of viral proteins, it is not surprising that Hsp90 appears to play a role in the life cycles of many pathogenic viruses and that targeting Hsp90 can effectively control virus replication in cell culture (33). In the present study, we have further investigated the role of Hsp90 in the norovirus life cycle and, in addition to our observed RNA binding activity of Hsp90, we identified that the major capsid protein VP1 of both MNV-1 and HuNoV are Hsp90 client proteins. Importantly, we further demonstrate that inhibiting Hsp90 negatively impacts norovirus replication both in cell culture and in vivo. We provide here a proof of principle that targeting a molecular chaperone may provide a therapeutic approach for treating or controlling norovirus infections.",

The chemicals were used at the concentrations indicated in the text. His-tagged recombinant Hsp90 was purchased from Cayman Chemicals, whereas recombinant His-tagged glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein was provided by Stephen Graham, University of Cambridge. His-tagged recombinant polypyrimidine-binding protein (PTB) and viral protein NS7 were prepared as described previously (38, 39). The plasmids pT7MNV:Rz, pSG, and pMNV-1 VP1 expressing MNV-1 genomic RNA, subgenomic RNA, and VP1 genes, respectively, as well as the plasmid pHuNOV VP1 expressing HuNoV VP1 gene, were cloned under T7 promoter in either pTriex or pcDNA3.1 vectors. BSRT7 cells were infected with fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase before transfections as described earlier (13). A plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Hsp90\u03b1 was a gift from Edouard Bertrand and was described previously (40). Where noted, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technology).",

We have previously identified Hsp90\u03b1/\u03b2 as a host factor that interacts with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the MNV-1 genome using RNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry (32). Many of the host proteins also identified within the network of interacting proteins are known Hsp90 client proteins (33). To independently corroborate the binding of Hsp90 with the MNV-1 genome, we performed RNA affinity chromatography as previously described (32), and the presence of Hsp90 was verified by Western blot analysis of the eluted fractions. Hsp90 was enriched following RNA affinity purification on the 5\u2032 as well as the 3\u2032 extremity of the MNV-1 genomic RNA (Fig. 1B). Hsp90 was not enriched on a control RNA (N/R) or with beads alone. To determine whether Hsp90 associated with viral RNA, we examined the ability of recombinant His-tagged Hsp90 (rHsp90) to enrich MNV-1 genomic RNA from total cellular RNA isolated from MNV-1-infected cells. Positive-sense viral RNA was selectively enriched by immobilized rHsp90, as well as with His-tagged poly-PTB and the viral polymerase NS7 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, negative-sense viral RNA was not enriched by rHsp90 (data not shown). This observation suggests an interaction of Hsp90 with viral RNA and agrees with previous observations describing viral RNA binding activity of Hsp90 in bamboo mosaic virus (46).",

Viral RNA polymerase (NS7) production was reduced by >50% (Fig. 2A), whereas genomic RNA levels, as well as virus titers, were reduced significantly (Fig. 2B and C). In addition, overexpression of Hsp90\u03b1 in 293T cells resulted in a statistically significant increase (>4-fold) in MNV-1 titers after transfection of purified VPg-linked MNV-1 RNA (Fig. 2D).

We examined the ability of 17-DMAG to interfere with MNV-1 replication in a virus yield assay, wherein cells were infected at a low MOI (0.01 TCID50/cell), and the effect on infectious virus yield at 24 h postinfection was determined. Treatment of cells with 0.3 \u03bcM 17-DMAG reduced the levels of infectious MNV-1 produced by >4 orders of magnitude without significant cytotoxicity (Fig. 3A).

In contrast to 17-DMAG, which binds the N terminus of Hsp90, novobiocin interacts with the C-terminal ATP binding site (50\u201352).

Pretreatment of MNV-1 with 17-DMAG had no effect on the titers of the treated stocks, indicating that 17-DMAG did not inactivate virions directly (Fig. 4A). To examine a role for Hsp90 in MNV-1 entry or uncoating, the effect of 17-DMAG on virus replication after transfection of VPg-linked viral RNA into HEK293T cells was examined. Importantly, since human cells are not susceptible to MNV-1 infection due to lack of a suitable receptor (13), infectious titers from human cells represent a single cycle only. Inhibition of Hsp90 activity in HEK293T cells by 17-DMAG resulted in a >3-log10 reduction in virus titer (Fig. 4B).

We observed that inhibition of Hsp90 activity had maximal effect on MNV-1 titer when 17-DMAG was added either at 0 or 6 h postinfection. However, a small, yet statistically significant reduction in infectious virus production could be observed even when 17-DMAG was added at 9 h postinfection (Fig. 4C).

As expected from our previous observations, Hsp90 activity inhibition using 0.3 \u03bcM 17-DMAG resulted in decreased virus titer by up to \u223c3 log10 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, viral RNA levels were decreased only at the later stages of infection and by up to \u223c1 log10 only (Fig. 5B). These observations suggested that although Hsp90 activity contributes to viral RNA replication, the primary function of Hsp90 appears to be at a late stage of the viral life cycle, after viral RNA synthesis has occurred. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone, and its activity is known to be required for the correct folding of a diverse number of viral proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 activity typically leads to the specific degradation of these viral proteins (33, 53, 54). We therefore examined the effect of 17-DMAG on the levels of MNV-1 structural and nonstructural proteins during infection (Fig. 5C) under the same conditions where cellular protein levels were unaffected (see Fig. 4D). The structural proteins VP1 and VP2 were almost undetectable in the presence of 17-DMAG at 12 h postinfection. As expected, due to the decrease in viral RNA levels, a minor decrease in nonstructural protein levels was also observed, although it is worth noting that not all proteins appeared to be equally affected; for example, the levels of NS6 and NS7 were less affected than NS1-2. These data, combined with the observation that inhibition of Hsp90 activity has a greater impact on viral infectivity than any observed effect on RNA synthesis, suggested that Hsp90 activity contributes directly to the formation of an infectious viral particle by regulating the stability of the structural proteins.",

Therefore, to further confirm VP1 as a Hsp90 client protein, the effect of inhibiting Hsp90 activity on the stability of VP1 was then examined outside the context of viral infection. The MNV-1 structural protein VP1 was overexpressed in cells either alone or with VP2 from the MNV-1 subgenomic RNA. Samples treated with 17-DMAG showed a reduced level of VP1, whether expressed alone or with VP2 (Fig. 6B), whereas the level of NS7 remained unaltered. Akt-1 is a well-known client protein of Hsp90 and was used as positive control to confirm the effective inhibition of Hsp90 activity (57). Taken together, these data independently corroborated that the MNV-1 structural protein VP1 interacts with Hsp90 and that its levels are reduced by inhibition of Hsp90 activity, confirming that VP1 is an Hsp90 client protein.",

            "text": "When Hsp90 activity is inhibited, client proteins are typically degraded via one of the several host cell quality control mechanisms (58\u201360). Inhibition of the degradative pathway involved in the loss of VP1 after Hsp90 inhibition should therefore result in the restoration of the VP1 protein levels. We thus examined the effect of inhibition of the major cellular degradation pathways, namely, the proteasome or autophagic pathways, in order to determine whether either of these processes played a role in degradation of the MNV-1 VP1 protein upon Hsp90 inhibition. Lactacystin, a well-characterized, specific proteasome inhibitor, was used to examine the role of the proteasome in the degradation of MNV-1 structural protein VP1 after inhibition of Hsp90 activity. Treatment with lactacystin failed to rescue 17-DMAG mediated reduction in the levels of VP1 protein in MNV-1-infected BV-2 cells (Fig. 7A). The accumulation of p21, a cellular protein continuously degraded by proteasome, was used as indicator of proteasome activity inhibition. We also investigated whether autophagy was involved in 17-DMAG-mediated reduction in the levels of VP1 using Atg5 knockout BMDMs. MNV-1 replicated to similar titers in both Atg5-deficient (Atg5flox/flox+LysMcre) and wild-type (Atg5flox/flox) BMDMs (34). Inhibition of Hsp90 activity using 17-DMAG reduced virus titers significantly in both Atg5-deficient and wild-type BMDMs (Fig. 7B). Similarly, the levels of viral protein VP1 were not rescued in Atg5-deficient BMDMs (Fig. 7C). These results indicated that Hsp90 inhibition-mediated degradation of MNV-1 protein VP1 is not mediated via either proteasome or autophagy. Furthermore, VP1 protein translation occurred in the presence of 17-DMAG (data not shown), suggesting MNV-1 VP1 is most likely degraded by a nonproteasomal and nonautophagy pathway. However, identification of the degradation pathway for VP1 requires further investigations.",

Neutral red is a photoactivatable small molecule that can be passively incorporated into virus particles during replication in cell culture. Neutral red-containing virus becomes light sensitive as exposure to light causes cross-linking between the viral RNA genome and the protein coat (42). 17-DMAG was administered to BALB/c mice intraperitoneally as a single bolus prior to infection, and the effect on virus replication in the intestine was examined. The effect of Hsp90 activity inhibition on viral replication in the distal ileum, the primary site of MNV-1 replication in vivo, was determined (35, 42). Mice treated with 17-DMAG showed a significant decrease in virus titers compared to vehicle control-treated mice (Fig. 8).

In the present study, we showed that Hsp90 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention against noroviruses. Using Hsp90 inhibitors, we demonstrated that the major role of Hsp90 activity in the norovirus life cycle is during genome encapsidation. We confirmed that the MNV capsid protein VP1 is a client protein of Hsp90 and that inhibition of Hsp90 activity causes VP1 degradation, most likely due to an inability to fold correctly. VP1 degradation results in an inability of MNV-1 genomes to be encapsidated and a significant reduction in the production of infectious virions. We have further shown that HuNoV capsid protein VP1 also interacts with Hsp90 and that inhibition of Hsp90 activity leads to the degradation of HuNoV VP1. Furthermore, we have confirmed Hsp90 activity is required for norovirus replication in vivo. Therefore, we propose that Hsp90 may provide a viable therapeutic target for the control of norovirus infections.",

Several factors, including high infectivity of norovirus particles, the persistence of noroviruses in the environment, a lack of lasting immunity, and prolonged shedding of virus from infected individuals, contribute to the explosive nature of norovirus outbreaks (63, 64). HuNoV infection usually presents as an acute and self-limiting disease; however, norovirus infection in infants and young children can develop into more severe gastroenteritis, with symptoms lasting up to 6 weeks (3, 65). Although many vaccine candidates have undergone clinical trials against noroviruses (66\u201372), the extreme genetic heterogeneity within the virus family, a lack of intergenogroup cross-protection, and rapidly emerging variant strains make generating a cross-protective vaccine a challenging, although not impossible, task. Vaccination is also not a suitable prevention strategy for immunocompromised and immunosuppressed patients, who often suffer from long-term norovirus infections lasting months to years. Therefore, the development of antiviral strategies for such patient cohorts is of great interest. Several efforts have been made to develop antiviral drugs against noroviruses (63, 73\u201378). Inhibitors targeting the viral genome or proteins have been tested in both cell culture and mouse models for their ability to inhibit norovirus replication (73\u201377). Small molecule inhibitors of cellular pathways have also been shown to inhibit MNV replication in vitro and in vivo; hippuristanol, a small molecule inhibitor of eIF4A, has been shown to inhibit MNV RNA translation and virus replication in cell culture (27), whereas a small molecule inhibitor of deubiquitinases can also inhibit MNV replication in vivo (78). Despite these efforts, no antiviral therapies are available to treat norovirus infections.",

As a consequence, these antiviral drugs often have a limited range of activity, often targeting only a single virus. The high mutation rates of RNA virus genomes also make many antiviral drugs vulnerable to the rapid emergence of drug resistance. In contrast, strategies designed to target host factors required for viral replication not only have the potential to act on a wider range of viruses due to common mechanisms of replication but also have a higher barrier to the development of resistance. This cellular targeting approach is gaining more enthusiasm and several such host factors, required by many viruses, have now been screened for inhibitors that may have broad-spectrum antiviral activity (27, 78\u201381).",

Hsp90 is a highly abundant and evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperone required for the conformational maturation of numerous client proteins, enabling them to carry out their biological functions (33, 82, 83). In addition, Hsp90 is required for the function of a large number of multiprotein complexes (84\u201386). Hsp90 plays an important role in the replication of a broad range of both DNA and RNA viruses (33). For example, in hepatitis C virus Hsp90 is essential for NS2/3 protease activity and stabilizes the NS3 protein (87, 88), and in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Hsp90 controls reactivation from latency (89), whereas in poliovirus Hsp90 is required for maturation and processing of the capsid protein precursor (P1) (49). Nonstructural proteins of MNV are encoded in a single open reading frame. However, the levels of some nonstructural proteins were affected more than others (e.g., compare levels of NS1/2 and NS3 in Fig. 5C). However, given a minor effect on viral RNA levels, but a major effect on infectious virus production, we focused our studies on the structural protein VP1. Our data, presented in Fig. 6 and 9, indicate that the structural protein VP1 of MNV and HuNoV are client proteins of Hsp90. The specific sequence requirements for the interaction of Hsp90 with the MNV-1 RNA are beyond the scope of the present study and will require further investigations; however, they fit with previous observations of RNA binding activity observed with bamboo mosaic virus (46). Hsp90 has previously been shown to interact with the genomic RNA of bamboo mosaic virus (46). The interaction of Hsp90 with a structural RNA motif in the 3\u2032UTR of the bamboo mosaic virus genomic RNA conferred its requirement for bamboo mosaic virus but not for bamboo mosaic virus-associated satellite virus. The role of the observed RNA binding activity in the norovirus life cycle also remains to be determined. It is possible that an interaction with viral RNA functions to recruit Hsp90 to newly synthesized viral RNA where it may then recruit VP1 subunits to initiate genome encapsidation. Further studies are clearly required to delineate the precise role of the RNA binding activity.",

For example, a viral structural protein must adopt a precursor conformation that is soluble, but hundreds to thousands of such protein units must then be orderly assembled into a capsid formation in the presence of viral genome that remains infectious despite extreme thermal and chemical conditions (90). The requirement of Hsp90 activity for pathways associated with cancerous cell proliferation has driven the development of inhibitors targeting Hsp90 activity (47, 91). The most effective inhibitors are based on the ansamycin antibiotic GA, which prevents ATP binding to Hsp90, rendering it inactive. There has been enormous interest in the development of Hsp90 inhibitors with an acceptable safety profile for the treatment of several cancers (47), and should any of these possess the correct toxicity profile, we would suggest that there is a possibility to repurpose these Hsp90 inhibitors against noroviruses.",

(B) MNV-1 nonstructural (NS7) and structural (VP1) proteins were expressed in BSR-T7 cells and tested for the ability to be degraded in the presence of 17-DMAG. An Hsp90 client protein, Akt, and GAPDH were used as positive and loading controls, respectively. NS7 levels remained similar, whereas VP1 levels were reduced in the presence of 17-DMAG.",

(A) The effect of specific inhibitor of proteasome activity, lactacystin, on the downregulation of MNV-1 protein levels due to 17-DMAG was examined using Western blot analysis. P21, a cellular protein degraded by the proteasome, was used as a positive control to confirm lactacystin activity in BV-2 cells. Akt-1, an Hsp90 client protein that is degraded by proteasome activity, was used as a positive control to confirm the rescue the effect by inhibition of proteasome activity. (B) Atg5-deficient (Atg5flox/flox+LysMcre) BMDMs were used to examine the role of autophagy in the degradation of MNV-1 capsid protein. Atg5-deficient and control (Atg5flox/flox) BMDMs were infected with MNV-1 at an MOI of 5 and treated with 17-DMAG. Samples were harvested at 24 h postinfection for virus titer and protein level determinations. The virus titer was determined by using the TCID50. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the error bars represent the standard deviations. (C) The levels of MNV-1 capsid protein VP1 and the autophagy markers, LC3-I and LC3-II, were determined by Western blot analysis. The conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II is blocked in Atg5-deficient BMDMs, but the levels of VP1 are not rescued.",

After 24 h, the distal ilea were harvested, and the infectious virus was titrated by a plaque assay either in dark (total) or in light (replicated).
