In this study, we have verified if the fulminant hepatitis induced by MHV3 could be related to an impairment of innate immunity. Groups of three C57BL/6 mice were infected with the pathogenic L2-MHV3 or attenuated YAC-MHV3 viruses, and the natural killer (NK) cell populations from liver, spleen and bone marrow were analysed. The percentage of intrahepatic NK1\u00b71 + T cell receptor (TCR)cells did not increase while NK1\u00b71 + TCR inter cells decreased in both L2-MHV3-and YAC-MHV3-infected mice. Concurrently, splenic and myeloid NK1\u00b71 + cells decreased in L2-MHV3-infected mice. However, the cytotoxic activity of NK cells increased in liver and decreased in bone marrow from pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice while no modification was detected in YAC-MHV3-infected mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that both normal and larger splenic or myeloid NK cells decreased more in pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice than in attenuated YAC-MHV3-infected mice. In vitro viral infections of interleukin (IL)-15-stimulated lymphoid cells from liver and bone marrow revealed that L2-MHV3 induced higher decreases in cell viability of NK1\u00b71 + cells than the YAC-MHV3 variant. The NK cell decreases were due to the viral permissivity leading to cytopathic effects characterized by cell rounding, syncytia formation and apoptosis. Larger NK + syncytia were observed in L2-MHV3-infected cells than in YAC-MHV3-infected cells. These results suggest that NK cell production is impaired by viral infection favouring fulminant hepatitis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Keywords apoptosis IL-15 mouse hepatitis virus natural immunity NK cells 42 M.

The viral persistence in liver is associated with a chronic hepatitis leading to cirrhosis, hepatic carcinoma and death [1] [2] [3] . The role of natural killer (NK) cells is to provide a first line of defence against bacteria, tumour cells and virus-infected cells through the exertion, without priming, of a cytotoxic function as well as a production of interferon (IFN)-g [4, 5] . However, the fulminance of the hepatitis cannot result from a deficiency in antiviral adaptative immune responses following a decrease in T and B lymphoid cells. The acute hepatitis suggests a virus-mediated deficiency in innate immunity mechanisms. However, it was reported recently that the hepatitis C envelope protein can bind to natural killer (NK) cells and impair their cytotoxic properties and IFN-g production, thus altering the host's natural defences and innate immunity against viral hepatitis [6, 7] . The liver contains a population of NK cells and a unique population of T cells with an intermediate level of ab -T cell receptor (TCR) cells expressing the NK1\u00b71 marker (NK-T cells) [8, 9] . The level of NK cell subsets in the liver during the first days of the infection depends on both their recruitment from peripheral lymphoid organs and the efficiency of NK cell production by the bone marrow. NK cells are large granular lymphocytes derived from bone-marrow (BM) progenitor cells which require an intact microenvironment as well as interleukin (IL)-15 production for their complete maturation into lytic cells [10, 11] .

We have showed that both normal and larger lymphoid cells decreased in virus-infected mice. The phenotyping of the cells indicated that normal NK1\u00b71 + decreased as soon as 24 h p.i. while large B cells decreased later, indicating that myeloid NK1\u00b71 + cells are more sensitive to virus-mediated depletion than B lineage cells. We can expect that the NK1\u00b71 + cell decrease in the first 24 h p.i. is due to a recruitment in liver. However, normal and larger NK1\u00b71 + cells decreased strongly at 72 h p.i. in bone marrow from L2-MHV3-infected mice only, suggesting a virus-induced decrease of these cells rather than a low recruitment in liver. The in vitro L2-MHV3 infection of rIL-15 stimulated cells, permitting the increase of the NK1\u00b71 + cells rather than B cells [11, 30] , revealed that the depletion of NK1\u00b71 + cells resulted from virusinduced cytopathic effects, viral replication and apoptosis occurring in syncytia, as demonstrated by the production of infectious particles and TUNEL assay. The permissivity of NK cells to L2-MHV3 infection involves the expression of the MHV receptor on the cell surface. CEACAM isoform 1 of the biliary glycoprotein (Bgp) molecules expressed on the cell surface are known to act as MHV receptor [31, 32] . These molecules are present in many cell types, including hepatocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, thymic epithelial cells and B lymphocytes [32, 33] . There are no reports concerning the expression of CEACAM-1 on mouse NK1\u00b71 + cells, but a similar protein was detected recently on human T cells and activated NK1\u00b71 + cells [34] , suggesting that viral permissivity of NK1\u00b71 + cells to MHV3 virus may be related to the presence of a specific MHV-receptor. Preliminary results from in vitro L2-MHV3 infections of NK1\u00b71 + cells cultured in the presence of myeloid dendritic cells revealed that the NK1\u00b71 + cells expressed intracellular viral proteins, thus reinforcing the hypothesis of viral replication in NK cells.

In spite of a similar production of infectious viruses in the first 24 h p.i., the apparent discrepancy in the sensitivity of NK1\u00b71 + cells to the attenuated YAC-MHV3 can be explained by the fact that a lower number of IL-15-stimulated myeloid cells can be efficiently infected by the YAC-MHV3 variant.

[24] have shown a higher replication of MHV and a more extensive hepatitis along with higher numbers of inflammatory foci in the livers of asialo-GM1-depleted mice, hinting at the important role of NK1\u00b71 + cells in limiting the spread of the viral replication during the first days of the infection. Rather, Stohlman et al. [22] have demonstrated that, in C57BL/6 mice, MHV-JHM induced an increase of natural cytotoxicity against YAC-1 target cells without detectable IFN-g production, such as seen in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-infected mice.

Our results are in agreement with these observations, but also suggest that higher cytotoxicity of intrahepatic NK cells from L2-MHV3-infected mice reflects extensive histopathological lesions leading to a fulminant hepatitis and a rapid death rather than an efficient antiviral natural response.
