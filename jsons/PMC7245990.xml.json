Commonly reported symptoms of a COVID-19 patient are fever, headache, vomiting, chills, dyspnea, nausea, sore throat, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, myalgia, diarrhea, and malaise. The severe infection leads to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sometimes multi-organ failures such as kidney failure, and even death [3]. SARS-CoV-2 genome showed higher sequence homology towards SARS-CoV than that of MERS-CoV through the whole genome sequence alignment analysis [4]. The coronavirus genome encodes four structural proteins: spike glycoprotein (S), a small envelope protein (E), matrix glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) [5]. The spike (S) glycoprotein present in CoVs acts as a viral antigen and responsible for host-receptor binding, virus internalization and induces robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in humans during infection. The internalization of SARS-CoV-2 initiates via binding to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The receptor binding and membrane fusion characteristic of spike glycoprotein make its an ideal target for the the attachment inhibitors for the management of COVID-19 [6].",

The innate immune response is critical for controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus. With the advent of new and more efficient screening assays and prediction methods, the efficacy of natural products/drugs that can effectively treat a wide range of viral infections by interfering with different host functions need to be explored during outbreaks [8]. Therefore, the screening of natural products/drugs from Ayurveda that may have the potential to modulate the host immune system as well as block the virus entry into the host cell by interfering with its cellular receptor has been elucidated, which may be an effective and broad-spectrum approach for combating COVID-19. This study may provide the understanding of antiviral activity of natural products which may enable us to establish a potential therapy for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner with a reduced level of associated toxicity.",

MVD offers precise predictions of ligand binding modes (87.0%) than other docking software such as (FlexX2: 57.9%, Surflex: 75.3%, GOLD: 78.2%, and Glide: 81.8%) [11]. The potential ligand binding site or cavities was predicted using MVD. Precisely 5 cavities were identified in the protein but only one cavity having maximum surface area and volume was selected as active site based on the active site residues described in the literature [11]. This cavity was utilized in further structure-based docking studies. Nafamostat (spike glycoprotein inhibitor) and captopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 inhibitor) were taken as a control for selected natural products/drugs [6]. The docking score of selected natural products/drugs was compared with the docking score of nafamostat for spike glycoprotein and docking score of captopril for angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 respectively. The natural products that showed higher docking score than nafamostat and captopril was considered a potent inhibitor of spike glycoprotein and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 respectively. Considering the suggested use in COVID-19, the hydroxychloroquine was also taken for comparison in this study.",

Therefore, targeting ACE2 may be considered as host-specific therapy to block SARS-CoV-2 from entering into the host cells and may facilitate the design of the novel attachment inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19. The docking results revealed that all the selected natural drugs showed higher binding affinity towards ACE2 except \u03b2-caryophyllene, citronellol, and eugenol as compared to captopril which is a known inhibitor of the enzyme. We have found that captopril interacts with amino acid residues His378, Asn394, Glu398, His401, and Glu402 of ACE2 to generate a binding score (MolDock score of \u2212 73.6975 kcal/mole and interaction energy \u2212 81.1588 kcal/mole) and forms three hydrogen bonds with Glu402 and Asn394 (Fig. 3).

Curcumin interacts with Ala348, His378, Asn394, Tyr385, His401, and Glu402 at the active site of the protein and generated MolDock score and interaction energy (\u2212 142.647 kcal/mole and \u2212 139.525 kcal/mole) and forms two hydrogen bonds with Tyr385 and Asn394. Similarly, nimbin also interacts with His378, Asn394, His401, Tyr510, Arg514, and Tyr515 at the active site and generated moldock score and interaction energy (\u2212 140.108 kcal/mole and \u2212 125.304 kcal/mole) and forms four hydrogen bonds with Asn394, Arg514, and Tyr515.

The calculated drug-likeness parameters of selected natural products using swissADME are given in (Table 3). The absorbtion profile is directly related to the availability of drug in systemic circulation. The admetSAR results revealed that all the selected natural drugs exhibited good intestinal absorption after the oral uptake in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, all the selected natural drugs also showed good water solubility and oral bioavailability whereas molecules such as nimbin, piperine, mangiferin, thebaine, berberine, andrographolide, quercetin, luteolin, resveratrol, naringenin, zingiberene, citronellol, and eugenol have shown poor human oral bioavailability. Distribution of drugs to the various tissue and organs guaranteed its better treatment efficiency. After the drug distribution analysis we have found that all the natural drugs have good blood\u2013brain barrier penetration except curcumin, mangiferin, quercetin, luteolin, resveratrol, naringenin, and gallic acid. Furthermore, based on distribution profile, non-substrates or non-inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and renal organic cationic transporter (OCT2) of the drugs were predicted which facilitate efflux of xenobiotics from the cells. The drug metabolism analysis suggested that all the selected natural drugs are predicted as either non-substrates or non-inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzymes. Further, the drugs were evaluated for carcinogenicity and hepatotoxicity and no drugs have shown carcinogenic effect whereas nimbin, curcumin, mangiferin, berberine, quercetin, luteolin, resveratrol, and naringenin were found to be associated with hepatotoxicity. The receptor binding analysis suggested that except the zingiberene, \u03b2-caryophyllene, citronellol, eugenol, and gallic acid, all the selected natural drugs have shown significant binding with cellular receptors such as estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, thyroid receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, aromatase and PPAR gamma receptor (Tables 4, 5 and 6).",

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a serious global public health and economic concern that emphasizes the significance of restricting infectious agents at international borders [14]. In the absence of approved antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 infection, more than 80 clinical trials of 20 drugs such as traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), human immunoglobulin, interferons, methylprednisolone, chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, bevacizumab, and hydroxychloroquine have been launched for the treatment of COVID-19 [15]. Natural products are gaining interest because of the large therapeutic window and potent antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recently, various drugs from natural origin have shown antiviral activity against the number of viruses such as Influenza virus, Zika virus, Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Herpes simplex virus, Hepatitis B and C virus, Respiratory syncytial virus, and Human immunodeficiency virus [16]. The importance of natural products for health and disease treatment have immense importance throughout human evolution. Several natural products derived from plants for thousands of years have been traditionally used to treat various types of human illnesses including viral infections. Natural plants such as Azadirachta indica, Curcuma longa, Withania somnifera, Ocimum sanctum, Emblica officinalis, Piper nigrum, Mangifera indica, Andrographis paniculata, and Zingiber officinale etc. have been listed in AYUSH system of medicine and extensively used as complementary and alternative medicine for the management of chronic fever, inflammation and auto-immune disorders. In addition, these natural products/drugs from Ayurveda have significant pharmacological activities that regulate various vital cell signaling pathways that cause cytotoxic, genotoxic, and mitogenic reactions leading to various disease pathologies [17].",

This research is primarily focused to develop therapeutics targeting the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its host receptor ACE2 to find potential attachment inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19. Recently various studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine may have potential while combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection [18\u201320]. However, we have found that natural drugs such as nimbin, curcumin, withaferin A, piperine and nafamostat (known spike glycoprotein inhibitor) have better binding affinity toward spike glycoprotein and its cellular receptor ACE2 compared to hydroxychloroquine. It has been reported that patients receiving hydroxychloroquine may experience several severe adverse effects such as visual disturbances, ventricular tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, hypokalemia, rhythm and conduction disorders including QT prolongation, and ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, development of potential attachment inhibitor from natural products is a safe and effective strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. Our docking results demonstrated that curcumin and nimbin are the best-ranked drugs among the selected natural products showing an inhibitory effect for spike glycoprotein and ACE2. Both the drugs have been traditionally used in AYUSH system of medicine for the management of various disease conditions such as inflammation, fever, and treatment of infections, autoimmune disorders like arthritis and neurological disorders [21, 22]. Most of these natural products/drugs have been recognized as safe for human usage. Besides, these natural products/drugs are also well-known regulator of various interleukins, chemokines, and cytokines.

Even though they may have strong docking energies, compounds violating more than 2 Lipinski\u2019s rule of 5 were not considered for drug-likeness. Molecules violating more than one of these rules may have problems with oral bioavailability [24]. Similarly, the knowledge of pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile of drugs is essential in order to measure the safety and efficacy of in biological system. Therefore, designing an attachment inhibitor from natural products may provide a safe, effective and broad-spectrum approach while combating viral infections. The findings of the present study would facilitate us to understand the antiviral mechanism of natural products which enables us to establish a potential therapy for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner with a reduced level of associated toxicity.",
