            "text": "Indole derivatives occur widely in natural products, existing in different kinds of plants, animals and marine organisms [1]. The indole core is a near-ubiquitous component of biologically active natural products. For example, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) 1 (Fig. 1\n), one of the most common naturally-occurrings, is a plant hormone of the auxin class [2]; tryptophan 2, an essential amino acid, participates in many essential biological processes [3]; serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 3, biochemically derived from tryptophan, is a neurotransmitter and is found in all bilateral animals [4]; melatonin 4, is a hormone found in animals, plants, and microbes, in which animals use the variation in duration of melatonin production each day as a seasonal clock [5]. The indole core is also well known as one of the most important scaffolds for drug discovery, and it has been a major focus of research for generations [6]. Biological studies of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) 5, and 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM) 6, also a natural product derived from the digestion of I3C which is found at relatively high levels in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and kale, have been the subjects of on-going research due to their interesting anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and antiatherogenic effects [7], [8], [9], [10]; Ajmalicine 7 (also known as \u03b4-yohimbine or raubasine), an indole alkaloid found naturally in various plants, is an antihypertensive drug used in the treatment of high blood pressure [11]. It acts as a \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonist with preferential actions over \u03b12-adrenergic receptors, underlying its hypotensive rather than hypertensive effects [12]. Reserpine 8, an indole alkaloid, is used to treat high blood pressure and severe agitation in patients with mental disorders [13]. Vinblastine 9, is used to treat several types of cancer, including Hodgkin's disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cancer of the breast or testicles [14].",

Indole derivatives have the unique property of mimicking the structure of peptides and to bind reversibly to enzymes [18], [19], [20], [21], which provide tremendous opportunities to discover novel drugs with different modes of action. There are seven indole-containing commercial drugs in the Top-200 Best Selling Drugs by US Retail Sales in 2012 [22]. This is highlighted by Cialis, an approved drug for the treatment of men's erectile dysfunction (ED), the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and both ED and the signs and symptoms of BPH [23], [24]. There are also an amazing number of approved indole-containing drugs in the market as well as compounds currently going through different clinical phases or registration statuses.",

Some familiar viral diseases include common cold, influenza, chickenpox, herpes, gastroenteritis (stomach flu), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS), hepatitis. Viral diseases can lead to serious, and potentially life-threatening complications, it is estimated that viral infections are responsible for more than 60% of the illnesses occurring in developed countries. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originated from southern China took the lives of nearly 800 people worldwide. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It is caused by a corona virus called MERS-CoV. As of June, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 699 cases of human infection with MERS, including at least 209 deaths. The most recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa in 2014 since its first appearance in 1976 has prompted WHO to declare international public health emergency. As of October, 2014, WHO reported that the current outbreak of Ebola has infected more than 7470 people and killed more than 3431 (Updated October 3, 2014). Antiviral drugs play an important role in fast-spreading epidemics; however almost all antivirals are subject to drug resistance as the pathogens mutate over time, becoming less susceptible to the treatment. Despite recent approvals of new antivirals in HIV and HCV therapeutic areas, there remain important unmet medical needs to improve upon the current therapy as well as those there exists no treatment.",

It is Arbidol demonstrated both immunomodulating and anti-influenza effects, specifically against influenza groups A and B, and SARS [27], [28]. It prevents contact and entry of the virus into cells by inhibiting the fusion of viral lipid membranes with cell membranes. It has an interferon-inducing action, stimulates humoral and cell-mediated immunity, helps the phagocytic action of macrophages, and heightens the body's ability to fight infection [28]. It decreases the frequency of complications associated with viral infections, and lessens the effects of chronic bacterial illnesses. In additional, arbidol also showed in vitro and in vivo activities against a panel of human respiratory viruses including influenza A virus (FLU-A, A/PR/8/34H1N1), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Human rhinovirus (HRV) 14, coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3), adenovirus type 7 (AdV-7) and HCV [29], [30], [31].",

Since then, better NNRTI such as efavirenz, and second generation NNRTIs such as etravirine and rilpivirine have been approved (http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/fact-sheets/21/58/fda-approved-hiv-medicines). Delavirdine inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of HIV protease inhibitors and thereby increases systemic exposure to protease inhibitors. The ability of delavirdine to enhance the pharmacokinetic profiles of protease inhibitors may permit the use of simplified administration regimens [33].",

Of all the synthetic initial hits, compound 28 was the most potent candidate. This revealed that the elimination of the phenylsulfonyl moiety preserved the anti-HCV activity, and the removal of the 6-bromo and 5-hydroxy groups from the indole ring of Arbidol did not have an influence on its anti-HCV efficacy. This implies that the indole core rather than these groups might be the antiviral pharmacophore.",

Robert C. Rizzo and co-workers reviewed current approaches to study the interactions between inhibitors and gp41, putting an emphasis on atomic-level computer modeling methods (Fig. 7\n). Compounds 35\u201338, having anti-fusion activity, were reported to interact in a specific manner with the binding site formed by the most conserved residues [50], [60]. For example, compound 35, discovered by virtual screening as a fusion inhibitor targeting gp41 [61], had high geometric overlap between its carboxylic acid and the position of Asp121 inside the binding pocket. Compound 36, discovered by a structure-based approach, exhibited inhibition constant of 2.1 \u03bcM and IC50 of 1.1 \u03bcM for cell\u2013cell fusion inhibition [61]. 37 with a long hydrophobic interface showed submicromolar binding, fusion inhibition and blocking viral replication. The molecular simulations showed that 37 was able to adopt a structure mimicking the hydrophobic contacts of the D-peptide PIE7 [62]. 38 exhibited effective activity against HIV-1 Env-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion with IC50 value of 1.3 \u03bcM, and bound in the hydrophobic pocket of gp41 to make a favorable interaction with Lys574 [63].",

In addition, several compounds showed nanomolar potency towards the K103N HIV-1 mutant strain and were superior to EFV, while some derivatives were superior to EFV against the Y181C and L100I HIV-1 mutant strains. Very interestingly, the enantiomers 57 and 58 showed small differences of activity against the NL4-3 HIV-1 strain, but 57 turned out significantly more potent than 58 against the whole panel of mutant HIV-1 strains. The enzymatic results for 57 and 58 were in well agreement with the cellular data. The molecular simulations suggested that the difference in the observed inhibitory activities of these two isomers could be due to a kinetic rather than affinity differences. The results showed compound 57 represents a robust lead compound to develop NNRTIs with improved activity and selectivity against K103N that is the most frequently emerging HIV-1 mutation in EFV-treated patients.",

Although in reality unsaturated nitriles are poor Michael acceptors that require reactive organometallic nucleophiles to undergo conjugate additions, the fact is that almost no approved drugs contain a cyanovinyl group, and lack of precedent is often taken as a warning sign in drug discovery. Keeping these consideration in mind, Won-Gil Lee and coworkers carried out computer simulations to guide the molecular design of bicyclic replacements for the CVP group, which led to the discovery of compounds 67, 68 and 69 (Fig. 17\n) [77].

Therefore, it is an urgent task to develop novel agents that interfere with alternate stages in the viral life cycle. Integrase catalyzed the integration of the HIV genome into the cellular chromosome, an essential process for HIV replication. Because of no mammalian counterparts, integrase has become an attractive target for antiviral drug design. Furthermore, integrase uses a single active site to accommodate two different configurations of DNA substrates, which may constrain the ability of HIV to develop drug resistance to integrase inhibitors (INI).

For example, the interaction between HIV-1 integrase (IN) and the cellular protein lens epithelium-derived growth factor or transcriptional coactivator p75 (LEDGF/p75) has recently gained attention as a valuable target for a novel antiviral strategy. For example, Chimirri and his coworkers established a structure-based pharmacophore model based on the X-ray crystal structure of HIV-1 IN in complex with LEDGF/p75 IBD [87]. Then, the 3D pharmacophore model was used as a query in a virtual screening approach to filter a library of 3055 small molecules and produced compound 94 as the best hit. After optimization, compounds 95 and 96 (Fig. 22) were obtained. In agreement with the prediction, compound 95 showed a higher potency than 94, while compound 96 proved to be the most active molecule, providing a valid starting point for the discovery of new and more potent derivatives able to disrupt PPIs between IN and its intracellular cofactor LEDGF/p75.",

Methylation of the hydroxyl group afforded the first dual inhibitor of HIV-1 integration process, compound 98, which inhibits both the IN ST step (IC50 = 0.14 \u03bcM) and IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction (IC50 = 36 \u03bcM). Very interestingly, the replacement of the 4-fluorobenzyl portion at N-1 with a 3,5-dimethylbenzyl moiety negatively influenced the inhibition of IN ST step. Compound 99 drastically reduced the ST inhibitory effects with respect to compound 98 (IC50 = 5.49 \u03bcM versus IC50 = 0.14 \u03bcM). Moreover, compound 99 showed a poorer anti-HIV activity (EC50 = 4.63 \u03bcM versus EC50 = 0.59 \u03bcM) in MT4 cells and cytotoxicity at the same concentrations. The introduction of an additional methoxy group at C-5 or C-7 position increases the IN-inhibitory effects [90]. For example, the disubstituted compound 100 is more potent than the 4-monosubstituted derivative 98. Moreover, the simultaneous presence of the methoxy substituent at 5 and 7 positions afforded the most potent INSTI of this series, the 4-[1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-5,7-dimethoxy-1H-indol-3-yl]-2- hydroxy-4-oxobut-2-enoic acid 101; it proved to be active at 6 nM concentration that is comparable to raltegravir (7 nM) and better than elvitegravir (15 nM), two HIV integrase inhibitors approved by US FDA in 2007 and 2012, respectively. On the contrary, the introduction of an additional methoxy group at C-6 seems to negatively influence the activity of this class of INSTIs.",

For example, HIV protease plays a key role in the life cycle of the virus, its inhibition prevents maturation of the viral particles and renders them noninfectious. More than 25 years after its discovery, HIV PR remains one of the primary targets for development of novel HIV treatments. Recently, allosteric regulation of HIV PR activity has been recognized as a novel way to limit the development of drug-resistance. X-ray crystallography experiments showed that two indole-carboxylate small molecules, indole-6-carboxylic acid (112) and 3-indolepropionic acid (113) (Fig. 27\n), could be used as fragment-like starting points for the discovery of novel HIV PR inhibitors, although these two fragments did not show significant inhibition of PR up to the concentration of 1 mM. In addition, Lucia Chiummiento and coworkers reported the synthesis and antiviral activity of new non-peptidic heteroaromatic molecules 114\u2013116 (Fig. 27) as protease inhibitors.
