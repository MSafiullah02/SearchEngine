No radiograph was done. The patient was previously healthy with no past hospitalisations, and works as an anaesthesiologist in a large medical centre in New York City. His only medication was emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, which he had been taking once a day for 5 months (and prior to that, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine once a day for 3 years). He was treated for influenza with oseltamivir for 5 days; symptoms resolved after 5 days of illness.

Oxygen saturation ranged from 89% to 99% at ambient air. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and in mild distress with normal breath sounds. Plasmalyte (2 L), vancomycin (1 g once every 12 h), and ceftriaxone (2 g once a day) were administered intravenously; all medications are detailed in the appendix (pp 1\u20132). The patient's white blood cell count was 13 900 cells per \u03bcL (reference range 4500\u201311 000), with a lymphocyte count of 9\u00b72% (15\u201350). Chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined nodule in the right mid-lung (figure 1A\n). The patient was admitted to the hospital. On hospital day 1, a respiratory viral panel test of an NP swab was negative, including for influenza. On day 2, RT-PCR (Roche Cobas 6800 System, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) of an NP swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. This assay targets open-reading frame 1, a region that is unique to SARS-CoV-2, and has a sensitivity of 1\u20135 copies per \u03bcL.6 An HIV test was negative, and intravenous azithromycin (500 mg once a day) was started. The remainder of the laboratory tests are summarised in the appendix (pp 1\u20132).",

On day 5, fever to a peak of 38\u00b79\u00b0C occurred, and the patient developed rigors and severe coughing. Intravenous azithromycin (500 mg once a day) was restarted and oral clindamycin (300 mg once every 6 h) was administered, without clinical improvement. A repeat chest CT on day 6 showed enlargement of the right lower lobe opacity, which had become surrounded by a large new ground glass opacity. A new rounded opacity was present in the left lower lobe, and a new multilobulated opacity in the right upper lobe (figure 1C\u2013E). The CT report suggested atypical pneumonia of fungal or viral origin. A repeat RT-PCR of an NP swab for SARS-CoV-2 was negative on day 7. Severe cough, malaise, rigors, and fever continued, and oxygen saturation was 92\u201394% at ambient air. Antibiotics were stopped on day 8, and prednisone 40 mg was given orally on the mornings of day 8 and day 9 for presumed cryptogenic organising pneumonia. Consulting radiologists noted CT evidence of a halo sign and reverse halo sign (figure 1B and 1E),7 suggestive of invasive fungal infection and not characteristic of previously reported CT findings for COVID-19.1, 8 On day 8, a serum galactomannan assay was ordered and pulmonary consultation was requested. The pulmonary consultant recommended bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and BAL.

Development of a cytokine storm has been reported in patients with COVID-19, but its occurrence within a few hours after onset of symptoms seems unusual,9 as does the initial clinical improvement.

However, for a disease that was unknown only 5 months ago, it might also be too early for clinicians to be certain of which manifestations are typical. In most patients requiring hospitalisation, COVID-19 is diagnosed by positive RT-PCR,1 and bronchoscopy is rarely required to establish the diagnosis. As noted by the American Association of Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology, \u201cbronchoscopy should have an extremely limited role in diagnosis of COVID-19 and only be considered in intubated patients if upper respiratory samples are negative and other diagnosis is considered that would significantly change clinical management.\u201d18 We agree with this statement, and feel that the presentation in our patient necessitated use of bronchoscopy.",
