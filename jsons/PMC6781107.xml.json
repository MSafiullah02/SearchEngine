Heritable genetic variation in susceptibility, i.e. an individual\u2019s propensity of becoming infected when exposed to infectious material, is ubiquitous, and many genetic selection schemes in livestock and plants target reduction in host susceptibility (Heringstad et al. 2000; Kover and Schaal 2002; Bishop et al. 2010; Houston et al. 2010; Dos Santos et al. 2016; Banos et al. 2017). A second host trait affecting disease spread and severity that has been considered in epidemiology is the hosts\u2019 infectivity (Read and Taylor 2001; Geenen et al. 2004; Keeling and Danon 2009; Brooks-Pollock et al. 2015), which refers to the ability of an individual, once infected, to transmit infection. In livestock breeding, individual variation in infectivity has not yet been exploited for disease control.",

            "text": "Individual variation in host infectivity has been observed in cases of super-spreaders, where a small fraction of highly infectious individuals generates disproportionally many new infections. Those have been described through the Pareto principle, where 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of transmission events (Woolhouse et al. 1997; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005). Super-spreading has been observed on a phenotypic level and is often attributed to social behaviour or heterogeneous contact structure. For example, in measles (Paunio et al. 1998), SARS and Ebola (Shen et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2015) in humans, in Salmonella typhimurium infection in mice (Gopinath et al. 2014), and in RNA-virus infections in bird species (Jankowski et al. 2013). The existence of super-spreaders has also been inferred in epidemiological models for bovine tuberculosis in cattle (O\u2019hare et al. 2014). Super-spreading has often been attributed to characteristics of the pathogens rather than the hosts, for example in Escherichia coli infection in cattle (Chase-Topping et al. 2008). However, emerging evidence suggests that infectivity and super-spreading may be also partly controlled by host genetics (Geenen et al. 2004; Doeschl-Wilson et al. 2011, 2018; Lyall et al. 2011; Raszek et al. 2016; Anacleto et al. 2018). Those findings imply that individuals can evolve different disease response types affecting disease spread, and offer new opportunities for genetic disease control that go beyond the reduction of disease susceptibility (Doeschl-Wilson et al. 2018; Tsairidou et al. 2018b). By using individual genetic risk estimates for infectivity it may be possible to prevent or mitigate epidemics in livestock populations through reducing the presence of super-spreaders.",

            "text": "Epidemiological simulation models have shown that removal of super-spreaders would be an effective means for reducing epidemic severity (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005). However, identification of highly infectious individuals prior to, or during the early stages of epidemics is extremely difficult in practice. Hence such models can realistically only predict the impact of removing super-spreaders as reactive disease control. In contrast, genetic disease control schemes are pro-active, i.e. preventive, as individuals can be selected based on genotypic information that can be collected at any stage, i.e. without the need of being exposed to infectious material. However, such genetic selection programmes usually operate on longer time-scales (over generations of selection) compared to those usually considered in epidemiological models. In epidemiology, the impact of realistic, long-term, pro-active genetic disease control, either alone or in combination with other control strategies, has rarely been assessed. The epidemiological benefits of genetic selection for reduced infectivity are thus currently unknown.",

            "text": "Until recently, estimating host genetic effects for infectivity from epidemiological data was not possible, as standard genetic evaluation tools routinely used in livestock industry do not fully capture genetic variance in infectivity (Lipschutz-Powell et al. 2012a, 2012b; Anche et al. 2015). Both susceptibility and infectivity are expressed through interactions between infected and non-infected individuals and, when subject to heritable variation, represent indirect genetic effects (IGE) (Lipschutz-Powell et al. 2012a; Anche et al. 2015; Baud et al. 2017). For IGEs, the phenotype of an individual depends on its own genetics and on the genetics of other individuals in the same contact-group. In other words, for infectious diseases, an individual\u2019s infection status depends on its own genetic susceptibility and the genetic infectivity of its infected group-mates (which also depends on their genetic susceptibility). Hence, infectivity is not directly observable and on a phenotypic level is confounded with susceptibility, as both affect the infection status of group-members. Thus, infectivity and susceptibility are latent traits that need to be inferred through available, often incomplete, epidemic data. Conventional IGE models that have proved adequate for production traits (Bergsma et al. 2008; Bouwman et al. 2010), fail to capture the dynamic, non-linear nature of disease processes (Lipschutz-Powell et al. 2013; Anche et al. 2015; Biemans et al. 2017). However, recent breakthroughs in statistical inference methods can now provide reliable estimates of genetic effects for both infectivity and susceptibility from inferred infection times, without requiring direct observation of an \u2018infectivity phenotype\u2019 (Pooley 2014; Anacleto et al. 2015; Anche et al. 2015; Biemans et al. 2017). This implies that one can select directly on the traits that drive the epidemiology rather than on the observed infection status. With the necessary methodology developed, it is timely and relevant to consider the potential benefits arising from adding infectivity as a new disease phenotype into genetic analyses. In the context of livestock production, the question arises whether incorporating this additional phenotype, would make a sufficiently valuable contribution to current breeding schemes. In other words, what is the expected impact of additionally selecting for lower infectivity on future disease prevalence and possibility of disease eradication?",

However, the benefits of genetic selection for both reduced susceptibility and infectivity on practical epidemiological field measures, such as disease prevalence and duration of epidemics, that are commonly used for assessing economic losses and guide the development of effective (often multi-faceted) disease control strategies, are currently not known. This is because the relationship between host genetic susceptibility, infectivity, and the practical field outcomes of epidemics is non-linear. This non-linearity arises from the equations underlying the dynamic progression of epidemics over time, so that for example, a small change in susceptibility and infectivity can result in changing the expectation whether an epidemic will occur or not (Doeschl-Wilson et al. 2011). Therefore, the practical impact of combining both susceptibility and infectivity in selection schemes in one or more generations cannot be estimated by standard index theory, which assumes linearity, and additional epidemiological approaches are needed to model the dynamic, non-linear epidemic processes.",

R0 has a threshold value of one which determines whether a disease outbreak can occur: when R0 is smaller than one, the epidemic will die out, whereas when R0 is greater than one major outbreaks can arise (Diekmann et al. 1990). Lipschutz-Powell et al. (2012a) suggested that selection on breeding values for direct and indirect effects reduces R0, while Anche et al.

For this purpose, a genetic\u2013epidemiological model was developed to combine classical quantitative genetics theory with epidemiological prediction. Specifically, polygenic genetic variation in susceptibility and infectivity was incorporated in a stochastic epidemiological susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to simulate epidemics in large livestock populations undergoing artificial genetic selection for lower susceptibility and infectivity, over several generations. The resulting model was then used to assess the efficacy of diverse genetic selection schemes targeting host susceptibility and infectivity in preventing disease outbreaks and reducing disease prevalence.",

This produced a simulated R0 for every group. Summary R0 values per generation were obtained by calculating the mean and the median of the simulated R0 values across groups for each generation. Although the mean R0 is more in line with the classical definition of R0 (e.g. Diekmann et al. 1990), the distribution of R0 values over groups was skewed due to the random allocation of individuals with different (skewed) susceptibility and infectivity values into groups. Hence the median over groups of the simulated R0 values, termed herein \u2018realised\u2019 R0, was used as a more appropriate summary statistic in the present analysis. Finally, the overall mean of the summary R0 statistic per generation with standard errors were calculated over 50 replicates. The overall trends of decline over generations of selection for the mean R0 were similar to those for the median (Supplementary Information 1).",

The effect on the infection rate, and hence on the epidemic, of the genetic variance in susceptibility and infectivity, is confounded with the effect of the average effective contact rate \u03b2 (see section \u201cWithin-group epidemic transmission model incorporatinggenetic variation in susceptibility and infectivity\u201d), hence \u03b2 was fixed to 0.02 and the variances were allowed to vary (Table 1). The above combination of variances for susceptibility and infectivity allowed to assume heritabilities of 0.2 for both latent traits (defined on the underlying scale), which corresponds to a lower heritability on the observed scale (i.e. binary infection status) within the range reported for common diseases (Brotherstone et al. 2010; Kemper et al. 2011; Boddicker et al. 2012; Bermingham et al. 2014a; Tsairidou et al. 2014; Raphaka 2018). In addition, previous studies have shown that heritability is likely to be underestimated in the context of infectious diseases due to incomplete exposure to infection (Bishop and Woolliams 2010). Hence, the heritability of 0.2 presented here, is a realistic and rather conservative value.",

In the base generation before selection, the mean realised R0 over replicates was 7.64 when assuming a genetic variance of 0.5, and 1.99 for a genetic variance of 0.2. Over generations, realised R0 declined due to genetic selection. The selection scheme combining susceptibility and infectivity, considerably reduced the number of generations required until realised R0 was <1; i.e. until disease eradication, compared to selection on susceptibility alone (Fig. 3). Specifically for the genetic variance of 0.5, selection on susceptibility required seven generations to bring the realised R0 from 7.64 to a value below 1 (Fig. 3). In contrast, combined selection, with the same selection intensities and accuracies for susceptibility and infectivity, required three generations to bring the realised R0 below 1 (Fig. 3). Selecting on infectivity alone produced similar changes in epidemic risk as selecting on susceptibility alone (Fig.3). For example, both 50% selection on susceptibility alone, or 50% selection on infectivity alone, reduced the realised R0 below 1 after seven generations of selection (Fig.3). For lower genetic variance of 0.2 resulting in lower realised R0 in the base generation, fewer generations were generally required until disease eradication, although the actual rate of decline in R0 was lower compared to that corresponding to larger genetic variance. For genetic variance of 0.2, there was a one-generation difference between selection schemes considering susceptibility or infectivity alone and combined selection including infectivity (Fig. 3).",

However, that does not imply the sign and magnitude of the underlying genetic correlation (Rauw et al. 1998). A strong positive genetic correlation would indicate that susceptibility to infection and infectivity are controlled by the same set of genes. However, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, there is no evidence suggesting that whether an individual becomes infected is regulated by the same genetic pathways as those controlling the transmission of infection.

This is due to the indirect correlated response arising in infectivity even when selection is on susceptibility alone. A positive correlation implies that individuals with lower susceptibility also tend to have lower infectivity, and selection against these individuals accelerates reduction in disease risk and prevalence. Conversely, when susceptibility and infectivity were antagonistically correlated, there was a substantial delay in the progress achieved by the selection scheme considering only susceptibility. However, considering both susceptibility and infectivity in the selection scheme helped alleviate this delay (Supplementary Information 5; Fig. S5 right panel). Such adverse correlations have been previously observed, for example, between milk yield and fertility traits in dairy cattle (Wall et al. 2003), or in cases of competition over resource allocation (Rauw et al. 1998; Read and Taylor 2001). Therefore, particularly in the case of an unfavourable genetic correlation between susceptibility and infectivity, estimating effects for both these traits can be crucial to avoid an undesirable increase in infectivity, which could counteract or even outweigh the benefits of selection for reduced susceptibility.",

In diseases with R0 much larger than one, selection on susceptibility alone might not be sufficient to reduce R0 and achieve disease eradication within a reasonable number of generations for a breeding scheme (Mackenzie and Bishop 2001; Bishop et al. 2010). Similarly, the genetic gain achieved would not be of practical value if there was very limited genetic variation in susceptibility available for selection. However, the results of this study reveal that, when subject to heritable variation, infectivity could complement susceptibility to accelerate progress in selection schemes, or could be an alternative disease-related target-trait for genetic disease control. Infectivity as an indirect genetic effect is likely to have been under weaker natural selection pressure, compared to direct genetic effects, therefore there might be more genetic variation in infectivity available for artificial selection compared to susceptibility (Bijma 2010b).",

The framework of this study could help to investigate the role of evolution in changing genetic variances and covariances in susceptibility and infectivity, which drive evolution in disease dynamics. Evolutionary studies have long recognised that the risk of infection has different components (Elderd et al. 2008), namely: (a) the risk of infection given exposure (which encompasses variation in host susceptibility), and (b) the risk of exposure (which encompasses variation in host infectivity). Furthermore, the Breeder\u2019s equation used in this study to calculate response to selection in host susceptibility and infectivity over successive generations, is commonly used in animal breeding to predict response to artificial selection. However, in studies considering natural selection, it has been previously suggested that the traits of interest might be correlated with other components, which may have not been explicitly accounted for, but which may also affect variation in fitness, and this may have an impact on the response to selection as predicted by the Breeder\u2019s equation (Morrissey et al. 2010). For example, the present simulations do not consider co-evolution between the host and the pathogen, which likely affects infection risk. Cooperation or competition between individuals sharing the same social environment also evolve through natural or artificial selection and that affects the variance in the target traits (Marjanovic et al. 2018). In evolutionary biology terms, selection for lower infectivity may enhance cooperation between the focal individual and its social partners to avoid or survive infection, and hence affect variation in infectivity; for example in plants, selection for less competitive phenotypes has led to more uniform crops (Austin et al. 1980; Denison et al. 2003).",

            "text": "In conclusion, host infectivity, in addition to susceptibility, was found to constitute an important trait to target in future genetic and genomic selection schemes to reduce the impact of epidemics in livestock populations more efficiently. Combined selection for reduced susceptibility and infectivity generated a greater reduction in epidemic risk, severity and duration, and with beneficial outcomes of selection emerging earlier, compared to selection targeting susceptibility alone. Advances in genomic technologies and novel statistical methods make it now feasible to determine genetic effects for novel traits that have a substantial impact on infectious disease prevalence but are difficult to measure, such as host infectivity. Therefore, genetic variation in infectivity and its potential benefits for genetic evaluations should be further investigated. The framework proposed here helps predict the impact of artificial selection on future disease dynamics and can facilitate investigation of the role of evolution.",
