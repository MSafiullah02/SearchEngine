History was, and still is, shaped since ancient times by viral diseases. These diseases began to be characterized in the 19th century leading to the identification and differentiation of many viral illnesses [1]. The first viruses were identified at the end of the 19th century and since then the process of discovery has continued steadily with a growing momentum in these years. In fact, in recent years it is possible to visualize viral structure at an atomic level of resolution, nucleotide sequences of viral genomes are known, and functional domains of numerous viruses and enzymes have been established [1], [2]. This information is now being applied to the development of diagnostic tools and effective antiviral therapies.",

The current classifications are based on the type and structure of the viral nucleic acid and its replication strategy, the symmetry type of the capsid of the virus, and the presence or absence of a lipid envelop [1], [2].",

The MDS algorithm produces a s \u00d7 q (q < m) configuration, X, representing point coordinates (items), where q is specified by the user. Thus, row i from matrix X gives the coordinates of object i in the q-dimensional embedding space. Configuration X preserves, as best as possible, the proximities between pairwise elements in the higher m-dimensional space and unveils the underlying data structure. MDS is, consequently, different from other similar techniques, such as factor and cluster analysis, because there are no assumptions concerning which factors might drive each dimension. Additionally, MDS is able to treat distinct types of data, has better convergence rates, and is less complex than other methods [3], [27].",

This problem, equivalent to minimizing the raw stress function, \u03c3\n2, can be formulated as [28]:(1)\u03c32=\u2211i=2s\u2211j=1i\u22121zij (\u03b4ij\u2212dij)2\u200b,where zij is a user chosen non-negative weight and dij is a measure of the (dis)similarities among the items in the embedding space. Therefore, dij is usually a distance measure. Smaller (larger) distances between two objects translate into more (less) similarities between them. For example, the Minkowski distance provides a general way to specify distance for quantitative data in a multidimensional space:(2)dij=(\u2211k=1q\u03b1k |xik\u2212xjk|r)1/r\u200b, r\u22651,where xik is the value of dimension k for object i and \u03b1k is a weight factor. When \u03b1k = 1, the Euclidean and the city-block distances are obtained for r = 2 and r = 1, respectively. Nevertheless, the MDS technique allows users to choose other metrics for the comparison of objects that can be better adequate for their data. In the sequel we will adopt the Canberra distance and the cosine correlation.",
