As in trace amounts is an essential nutrient for energy generation in prokaryotes and several eukaryotes, including birds and mammals. It is also possible that As is an essential trace element for humans, although its role in metabolism has not been clearly defined (Oremland and Stolz 2003; Uthus 1992; Zoroddu et al. 2019). The human body contains approximately 0.08\u20130.02 mg As/kg, which mainly is concentrated in liver, kidneys, lungs, bones, and hair. The environmental presence of As imposes a major health problem worldwide since it has been clearly shown that excessive or prolonged exposure to its compounds results in severe acute or chronic toxicity leading to a range of medical complications termed as \u201cArsenicosis\u201d (Abdul et al. 2015; McCarty et al. 2011; Straif et al. 2009).",

When As reacts with metals, arsenides are formed. With halogens, As results in the formation of halides. With halogens, As results in the formation of halides. As salts are soluble in water, resulting in its easy release from the earth's crust into water due to the natural processes of geogenic leaching of rocks and sediments containing this element.",

Since the number of people who are at risk of chronic As poisoning for a long-term intake of contaminated water and food is extremely high, the development of specific therapies is required. There are two main approaches to minimize the human health impact of As poisoning and As-contaminated groundwater: prevention and cure. However, there is no particular therapy for chronic As exposure that is more frequently caused by the long-term ingestion of contaminated water and food. Many factors can affect the bio-accessibility, metabolism, and toxicity of As, such as chelation mechanisms, diet, and nutrition. Measures are urgently required to focus on reduction in As toxicity, early diagnosis, and therapy of As-induced outcomes. Treatment options advocated are chelation therapy, vitamin and mineral supplements, and antioxidant therapy (Nurchi et al. 2020; Ratnaike 2003).",

Although the content of As in the earth's crust is only 0.0005%, this element is part of more than 200 different mineral forms. The main mineral hosts of As are sulfides, as arsenopyrite (FeAsS), orpiment (As2S3), and realgar (As4S4) (Garelick et al. 2008). FeAsS, with 46% As content, is the leading industrial mineral (Wang and Mulligan 2006). As is also widely distributed in nature in the form of arsenite (As2O3) and arsenate (As2O5). Small As concentrations are often associated with lead (Pb), copper (Cu), and silver (Ag) ores. When the minerals are smelted, gaseous As is trapped and transformed in arsenic trioxide (As2O3). Thus, As2O3 is mainly obtained as a by-product of the smelting of Cu, Pb, or gold (Au) ores, from which the most commercially available As compounds are obtained (Pinto and McGill 1953). In China, the Philippines and Peru, As has been recovered from orpiment and realgar, in Chile from copper\u2013gold ores, whereas it is associated with Au occurrences in Canada and cobalt arsenide in Morocco. In 2018, the average annual global production of As was approximately estimated in 35,000 metric tons, with China (24,000), Morocco (6000), Namibia (1900), and Russia (1500) as the world leaders in As2O3 production (USGS 2019). In the past decades, As production increased by 25% every 10 years. Consequently, the technogenic pollution by As compounds related to metal processing and burning brown coal poses a critical threat (Garelick et al. 2008).",

Moreover, As is used in alloys mainly in association with Pb or Cu in semiconductors, pigment, glass, car batteries, and enamels. In developing countries, As compounds are widely utilized in agriculture as herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides as sodium arsenate, calcium arsenate, cacodylic acid, and other compounds. Therefore, the use of As-containing chemicals in agriculture transfers this toxic metal into food of both animal and vegetable origin (Han et al. 2003; Upadhyay et al. 2019). Millions of people worldwide are significantly exposed to high As levels contained in meat, fish, grains, and vegetables, health supplement products (herbal-based medicines), as well as through food that has been processed using As contaminated water. Foodborne As exposure causes a significant global burden of human disease (Oberoi et al. 2014). The organoarsenic compounds roxarsone (4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenearsonic acid), nitarsone (4-nitrophenyl)arsonic acid), arsanilic acid (4-aminophenylarsonic acid), and carbarsone ([4-(carbamoylamino)phenyl]arsonic acid) are still widely used as feed additives in poultry and swine production as antiparasitics and weight gainers (Nachman et al. 2013, 2017; Zhao et al. 2020).

            "text": "It is well established that As is a traditional poison responsible for various human diseases, including cancer as well as deleterious effects on the urinary bladder, lung, kidney, and skin. Beyond these effects, As-based preparations have been shown to possess beneficial therapeutic properties. The medical use of As has been known since at least 4000 years ago, and even today, some As compounds are administered and used in several countries. Historically, arsenic trioxide has been applied in traditional ancient Chinese medicine and later in western medicine. In the middle of the nineteenth century, As-based preparations were the first effective chemotherapy agents against syphilis, parasites, and leukemia (Au 2011). Since 1845, Fowler\u2019s solution, which contains 1% potassium arsenite (KAsO2), has been used to treat leukemia, chronic bronchial asthma, malaria, and psoriasis (Ho and Lowenstein 2016). Until the late 1950s, its use continued in the US for the treatment of syphilis, malaria, and other diseases (Jolliffe 1993). Preparations also based on organic As compounds have also found clinical application due to their positive therapeutic effects. For instance, arsenobenzene has been administered to treat protozoal infections. Arsphenamine (salvarsan, 4,4\u2032,4\u2033-(1,2,3-Triarsirantriyl)tris(2-aminophenol)) has been used to treat syphilis. A significant disadvantage of the As-drugs is related to their high toxicity, as the induction of severe side effects already mentioned (Cooper et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2020). Nowadays, chronic and fatal acute As poisoning from traditional Chinese medicine use is still a threat (Chang et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2013; Zheng et al. 2019). In a clinical case of a Chinese man suffering from fatigue, weakness, numbness, together with hyperkeratosis in his hands and feet, the inorganic As level in urine was more than 120 times higher (1235 \u00b5g/l) than normal. The patient reported consuming for 5 years homemade traditional \u201cherbal balls\u201d containing up to 80 ingredients, comprising As (Spilchuk and Thompson 2019). The homeopathic drug \u201cArsenicum album 30C\u201d, for which a scientific debate continues particularly in India about its effectiveness in treating different disease states [as in ameliorating the health condition from chronic As poisoning (Mallick et al. 2003)], is currently advertised in the preventive and prophylactic treatment against the dangerous and contagious epidemic coronavirus COVID-19. Such a drug is made by sequential centesimal dilution of arsenic trioxide mother solution for thirty times until there is not a trace of As in solution or even a single water molecule that has encountered any of the original As atoms. Scientists globally consider homeopathy as a scientifically failed medical practice (Ernst 2002) and reject that \u201cArsenicum album 30C\u201d can act against the new virus. Furthermore, these claims can be counterproductive in dealing with a serious health emergency, and they can lead to potentially dangerous consequences, i.e., cases of acute As poisoning for those people who might think of preparing homemade As-based drugs without proper dilution.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the current interest in the application of As-based drugs as therapeutic remedies in medicine is particularly flourishing and precisely focused in the cancer research area (Alipour et al. 2019; Wahiduzzaman et al. 2020). In 2001, US FDA and in 2002 EU commission approved an arsenic trioxide drug for its high effectiveness in the treatment of acute and promyelocytic leukemia (Au 2011; Chen et al. 2011; Iland and Seymour 2013; Liu et al. 2012). Recently As2O3 has also been proposed as a promising candidate for lung cancer treatment, alone or in combination with the classic cisplatin drug (Huang and Zeng 2019; Medici et al. 2015; Miodragovi\u0107 et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019). The synergic effect of As2O3 with a B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family inhibitor (ABT-737) in uterine cervical cancer cells was also evidenced to ameliorate ABT-737 target therapy (Hsin et al. 2019). Recently, a controlled-release of As2O3 by multifunctional nanoparticles strategy (nano-ZrO2 carriers with mitochondrial targeting) in order to improve the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and reduce the toxic side effects, has been investigated with positive results (Wu et al. 2020). Arsenene nanosheets have been proposed as biosafe new therapeutic agents for acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (Wang et al. 2019). Arsenic sulfide (As4S4) has been suggested as a potential antitumor agent for gastric cancer since it effectively inhibits human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line proliferation by inducing apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo through a p53-dependent pathway (Zhang et al. 2015). Mild or moderate side effects are common (10\u201330%), but severe and sometimes fatal complications can occur when As exceeding toxicity thresholds. Therefore, the administration of these drugs should be evaluated when beneficial effects outweigh metal toxicity. The development of new strategies employing the use of As-based drugs in coated NPs systems provides a promising alternative for safe and effective tumor treatment (Lian et al. 2019). However, consideration of the individual genetic predisposition, co-exposure to other toxins, diet, and particularly vulnerable neurological conditions should be taken carefully into account in prescribing these treatments (Bj\u00f8rklund et al. 2020).",

            "text": "The most famous poisonous substance, 2-chlorovinyldichloroarsine (Fig. 1), known with the common names of Lewisite (Germany), L (USA), and P-43A (Russia), is a colorless liquid with an irritating geranium odor acting as a powerful blister agent and lung irritant. The boiling point of Lewisite is + 190 \u00b0C, which allows it to be classified as a persistent toxic substance. The freezing point is \u2212 45 \u00b0C, meaning that there are no climatic restrictions on its use in different seasons of the year. In summer, its poisonous properties remain on the ground for 4\u201312 h, while in winter, several days. The volatility at 20 \u00b0C is 4.5 g/m3, and since the vapor is heavier than air, it will settle in low-lying areas. Lewisite causes damage both in the drip-liquid state and in the form of steam or fog. Following contact and aerosol exposure, its toxic properties occur in the skin, lungs, and eyes, while in the case of penetration into the gastrointestinal tract, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia occur. The skin-resorptive LD50 for humans is 20 mg/kg. By absorption through the skin, Lewisite causes general intoxication of the body. The most sensitive organs to the action of vapors are the eyes and upper respiratory tract. The threshold concentration causing eye irritation is 0.002 mg/l. Severe eye irritation and damage to the upper respiratory tract occurs after 15 min at a Lewisite concentration of 0.01\u20130.03 mg/l. The relative toxicity of Lewisite during inhalation LC\u03c4 50 is 1.3 mg/l/min (Goldman and Dacre 1989; Hoenig 2007; NIOSH 2011; Dyadchenko et al. 2018).",

Economic activity such as fishing, collection of rapans and mussels, common sources of local food, is usually carried out also in the contaminated areas. Therefore, there is a severe risk to the health of the population living around these regions. The concentration of As in seawater of Kerch Strait (the strait connecting the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov) ranged from 4.58 to 132 mg/l in 2007, and from 0.21 to 6.27 mg/l in 2008 (Prokhach and Mykhalska 2009).

Before the international treaty \u201cConvention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter\u201d, signed in 1972 in London by a majority of nations, millions of tons of munitions have been disposed throughout the world's oceans determining an environmental risk for its natural resources (Be\u0142dowski et al. 2016; Czub et al. 2018; Edwards and Be\u0142dowski 2016; Szubska 2018). The current use of chemical weapons poses a serious threat to people from short to a long spread of As in the environment. Most states have joined the Chemical Weapons Convention (Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction), which obligates the destruction of all chemical weapons by 2012 (OPCW 1992). However, about 25 nations currently possess weapon stockpiles or are suspected of secretly stockpiling or possessing chemical weapons research programs. In Syria, for example, at least four plants for the production of toxic substances as weaponries have been counted. The access to weapon stockpiles by terrorists or accidental exposure could be highly dangerous for people and the environment. In July 2012, Syrian authorities officially recognized the availability of chemical weapons in the country, and according to the United Nations, their stocks reached thousands of tons before the Civil War. From 2013 to the end of 2016, chemical attacks took place in the suburbs of Damascus and in the Hama provinces (2014), in Idlib (2014 and 2015), Homs (2015) and Aleppo (2016).",

Toxic polyneuropathy and peripheral neuropathy often occur. Tetraplegia or paresis develop with the prevalence of lesions of the peroneal muscles. In rare cases, there are injuries of the individual cranial nerves: facial, trigeminal, vagus, and sublingual ones. Toxic polyneuropathy is usually accompanied by pronounced vegetative trophic disorders: hyperkeratosis, over-exfoliation of the skin on the extremities, hair loss, ulcerative processes on the gums, and vasomotor disorders. The development of clinical symptoms of toxic polyneuropathy initially occurs with symptoms of irritation of the nerve trunks. This leads to sharp pains in the extremities, accompanied by the phenomena of hyperpathia, ataxia, and a marked decrease in vibrational sensitivity. The progressive development of movement disorders, muscle weakness, and paresis can lead to complete paralysis. Behavioral changes, obfuscation, and memory loss are also observed. It has also been reported psychoses due to As poisoning (Fajzulina and Atamanjuk 2007; Jomova et al. 2011; Schenk and Stolk 1967; Wu et al. 2017). Epidemiological evidence indicated that low dose chronic exposure to As, especially in the form of arsenite, increases the risk of developing skin, kidney, bladder, liver, lung, and prostate cancer (Arita and Costa 2009; Benbrahim-Tallaa and Waalkes 2008). Since arsenite is weakly mutagenic, carcinogenesis may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, as in the case of other carcinogens (Chervona et al. 2012; Peana et al. 2013; Zoroddu et al. 2010).",

Existing studies on the effects of As in high doses indicate a risk for pregnancy, whereas the effects in small doses start to appear in the literature (Milton et al. 2017). As-containing compounds cause an abnormal pregnancy outcome in experimental animals at sufficiently high levels. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriages, stillbirths, and infant deaths have been reported in communities that consumed drinking water with As concentrations above 50 ppb (\u00b5g/l) and often above this level (Amadi et al. 2017; Concha et al. 1998; Rahman et al. 2019). Epidemiological studies of areas with high levels of As in drinking water indicate an association between in utero As exposure and the development of adult diseases such as cancer, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes (Sanchez et al. 2016; Steinmaus et al. 2014; Vahter 2008; Young et al. 2018).",

Because of the short half-life of As in blood, hematological estimation is useful in particular in the diagnosis of acute intoxication. Inorganic As incorporates into hair and fingernails due to its affinity to the sulfhydryl groups in keratin. The metal deposition requires at least 2 weeks after exposition to appear. In chronic poisonings, As levels found in hair samples are in the range 0.1\u20130.5 mg/kg, while in acute poisonings, the As concentrations reach values between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg. Another common clinical manifestation of chronic As exposure is the appearance of Mee\u2019s lines in the nails. Hair and nail tests are particularly useful to determine the level of As exposure in the previous 6\u201312 months (in these case, long hair are needed to define the history associated with exposure). Other key characteristic features as skin lesions, melanosis, keratosis, and pigmentation are often used for diagnosing chronic As poisoning since they usually develop from 5 to 10 years after initial exposure. Analytical methods used to measure As levels are based on anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), radiochemical methods, X-ray spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HPLC-AFS), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), or graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) (Caussy 2006; Keil et al. 2011; WHO 2001).",

It is used as a chelator in chronic As poisoning where the signs of arsenicosis are severe, or the patient has complications (Mathieu et al. 1992). Currently, the clinical use of this drug is restricted for acute As intoxications to only the initial treatment, because of its toxicity and the necessity of frequent painful parenteral administrations (Nurchi et al. 2020). BAL is formulated in peanut oil because of its lipophilic nature and administered intramuscularly at an initial dose of 3\u20135 mg/kg of body weight every 4 h. This chelating agent demonstrated high systemic distribution and ability to compete effectively with the thiol groups of proteins for binding the As ion (as well as Au, Hg, and Pb), which is then excreted in the urine. This therapy is frequently effective in preventing or neutralizing systemic toxicity, but severe side effects occur. These include hypertension, nephrotoxicity, and the propensity to concentrate As in several organs, including brain and testes (Yadav and Flora 2016).",

DMSA is generally administered orally at 8\u201350 mg/kg/day therapy doses (Chang et al. 1996). DMSA hydrophilicity limits its access to intracellular compartments and is consequently distributed mostly in the extracellular fluid (Bradberry and Vale 2009). It has limited bioavailability and is mostly found covalently bound to plasma proteins with a half-life in humans lower than 4 h (Dart et al. 1994). Of an orally administered dose of DMSA, 10 to 25% is excreted in the urine, the majority within 24 h (Maiorino et al. 1989; Sears 2013). The remainder is primarily eliminated in the feces (Chang et al. 1996; Sears 2013). In a randomized placebo-controlled trial involving 22 patients, DMSA was not effective in the development of any clinical or biochemical benefit or histopathological improvement of skin lesions in patients with chronic arsenicosis (Guha Mazumder et al. 1998). DMSA, as well as BAL, causes Zn and Cu depletion.

The concomitant use of DMSA with these long carbon chain analog, as MiDMSA or MchDMSA, showed an improved efficiency in reducing As levels and alleviating oxidative stress when compared to DMSA alone (Bhadauria and Flora 2007; Kosnett 2013; Mishra et al. 2008; Modi and Flora 2007). Nowadays, one of the strategies in the treatment of As poisoning is also the co-administration of antioxidants (Flora and Pachauri 2010). It has been observed that the combined administration of NAC with MiADMSA was more effective than MiADMSA monotherapy against chronic As poisoning in guinea pigs (Kannan and Flora 2006).",

DMPS is not able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, contrary to BAL. Consequently, it does not redistribute As to the brain (Gerhardsson and Aaseth 2016; Jones 1995). The excretion of DMPS and its metabolites is relatively fast. Within 5\u20136 h, about 80% is excreted in the urine (Bj\u00f8rklund 2015). The oral absorption of DMPS is significantly higher than DMSA (Sears 2013). Other administrations are through intravenous, rectal, and transdermal routes. In acute As poisoning, intravenously administration of NAC demonstrated better therapeutic efficacy than intramuscular DMPS (Martin et al. 1990). After intravenous injection of DMPS, the half-life in plasma is 30\u201345 min, and its metabolites are rapidly eliminated from the body through the kidneys within 2 h (Aposhian et al. 1986).",

As BAL and DMSA, also DMPS enhance Cu and Zn urinary excretion, which in some patients give deficiency symptoms (Flora and Pachauri 2010; Kosnett 2004). The trace elements Cu and Zn are both antagonists in function and essential for living cells (Bj\u00f8rklund 2013; Chasapis et al. 2012; Zoroddu et al. 2019). Consequently, monitoring their concentrations during chelation treatment is required (Lachowicz et al. 2015). In particular, DMPS influences the mineral equilibrium of the body more than DMSA and is more toxic (Aposhian et al. 1989). Therefore DMSA should be preferred to DMPS (Kazantzis 2007). However, for the treatment of As poisoning in patients with anuria, DMPS is probably the safest and most effective chelating agent, while DMSA should not be used (Hsiao et al. 2019).",

PCA is capable of forming non-toxic, water-soluble chelated compounds with heavy metals, which are then excreted in the urine. Due to the presence of a stable sulfhydryl group, PCA can decompose the disulfide bonds of macromolecular complexes. Historically, PCA was the first chelator used for Wilson's disease because of its affinity for Cu (Walshe 1956). It also mobilizes As, but it is not generally a drug of choice (Hall 2002). In the clinical case of poisoning with As, which developed after the administration of contaminated Ayurvedic drugs, the state of patients was improved after the withdrawal of the medications and treatment with PCA (Pinto et al. 2014). Although, in this case, the patient's condition was improved, the effectiveness of PCA for treating As poisoning is contradictory. It has been reported that in animal experiments, the effectiveness of PCA with respect to As toxicity has not been confirmed (Aposhian et al. 1981; Hilmy et al. 1991; Kreppel et al. 1989).",

The chemical and biological activity exhibited by EDTA is affected by the formation of four or six bonds with its oxygen donors with transition or alkaline metal ions (in particular Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Hg, Pb). The impact of EDTA treatment of disorders associated with pentavalent As poisoning is caused by the effect on paracellular transport. The removal of extracellular Ca2+ causes retraction of the tight-junctional proteins with the formation of large paracellular openings between cells, which leads to a functional increase in permeability of the intestinal epithelium and further removal of arsenical species in Caco-2 cell line as a model (Calatayud et al. 2010). Several side effects are associated with the administration of EDTA including hepatotoxicity, renal failures, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, arrhythmias, tetany, hypocalcemia, hypotension, mucocutaneous lesions, bone marrow depression, convulsions, fatigue, headache, fever, nasal congestion, lacrimation, glycosuria, myalgia, and increased urinary frequency. Moreover, prolonged chelation treatment with EDTA fallouts in the depletion of essential metals as Zn, Cu, and manganese (Mn). One of the negative features of using EDTA in the treatment of chronic As intoxication is its ability to inhibit \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase by the removal of Zn from the site and further development of degenerative cellular processes via oxidative stress (Modi and Flora 2007).",

            "text": "Recently, NBMI (N,N\u2032-bis-(2-mercaptoethyl) isophthalamide, Emeramide) has been proposed as an alternative to the current chelators (Fig. 3). NBMI has been shown to possess the capacity to penetrate cell membranes and to cross BBB combined with an antioxidant property for scavenging and reducing the toxicity levels of hydroxyl free radicals, dangerous for the normal redox status of the cells. NBMI was first proposed against Hg poisoning but also appears to be, at least in vitro, able to selectively chelate As ions as well as other toxic and non-essential metals such as Pb, cadmium (Cd), and uranium (U) without evidence of toxicity (Schutzmeier et al. 2018). NBMI is based on carboxyl benzoate with two arms made of cysteamine moieties attached to the 1st and 3rd carbon groups of the aromatic ring. The two-SH groups of cysteamines are free to flex and rotate in order to accommodate several toxic soft acid metal ions. Trial phase 1 safety study and phase 2 clinical trials showed no adverse effects in humans (Trial identifier: NCT04183595, Emera008). Currently, NBMI is going through the FDA and the European Medical Agency (EMA) and the drug approval process.",

            "text": "In acute As poisoning, metallic taste and dry mouth appear, with difficulty and pain in swallowing. In any way, gastrointestinal disorders occur like colic, nausea, vomiting, which can become irresistible, diarrhea, stool in the form of rice broth with an admixture of blood. The loss of fluids leads to severe dehydration of the body. An increased weakness, headache, dizziness, and decreased body temperature and blood pressure as a result of vascular collapse appear. The occurrence of periorbital edema, visual disturbances, skeletal muscle cramps, oliguria, proteinuria, hematuria is possible. After 8\u201315 days from the onset of the disease, there is a sharp pain in the extremities, trophic disorders, paresthesia, paresis, with predominant extensor lesions. Death comes from paralysis of the respiratory and vascular centers. In the survivors, there is a severe diffused lesion of the nervous system in the form of toxic encephalopathy (impaired speech, coordination of movements, epileptiform convulsions, hyperkinesia by type of chorea, memory impairment, psychosis), encephalomyelopolyneuritis (Wexler 2000; Ratnaike 2003). In the treatment of acute As poisoning, it is first of all necessary to prevent or minimize its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract; to provide general supportive therapy to aid with breathing, blood circulation, and water-electrolyte balance, and to control the state of the nervous system. The removal of absorbed As may be facilitated by diuresis, bile excretion, hemodialysis, or exchange transfusion (Kazantzis 2007). Arsenic is slowly bound to serum protein ranging from 5.3% (trivalent inorganic As) to 6.5% (pentavalent inorganic As) (Zhang et al. 1998), but has a high volume of distribution (from 3.3 up to 4 l/kg) and rapidly passes from serum to tissues (its half-life in phase I occurs within 1\u20132 h, where about 90% As redistributes within 3 h) (Lai et al. 2005). Theoretically, there is a therapeutic window in the first few hours after ingestion for early extracorporeal purification of blood without chelation. Nevertheless, the chelator is strongly recommended for all stages of acute As poisoning in patients with anuria, as it always increases the availability of metal in the serum for dialysis (Mathieu et al. 1992) and minimizes the likelihood of further morbidity and mortality. The current recommended treatment for acute As poisoning is the use of specific metal chelators, able to interact with As and to form strong low-toxic complex compounds that are mainly excreted in the urine. Chelation therapy for acute As poisoning is recommended because the benefits exceed the risk of side effects. Even when there are unconfirmed suspicions of As ingestion, the administration of chelating agents is recommended for the prevention of acute renal failure. Thiol-based metal chelators such as DMSA, DMPS, BAL, and PCA are mainly administered in acute As poisoning (Bj\u00f8rklund 2015; Modi and Flora 2007; Vasken Aposhian et al. 1984). DMPS and DMSA, due to their high water solubility, low toxicity, and high therapeutic indexes, are superior to BAL in the treatment of acute As poisoning and DMPS should be selected as the first choice respect DMSA in both oral and/or parenteral chelation treatment because of its greater antidotal potency (Aaseth et al. 2016a; Kosnett 2013). In acute As poisoning, DMPS is used as a 5% solution for intravenous and intramuscular injection, as well as tablets and capsules for oral administration. The drug is scarcely toxic: LD50 for mice after subcutaneous administration is 5.22 mM/kg (Aposhian et al. 1981). DMPS is well-tolerated, but in some cases of prolonged use, nausea, tachycardia, and allergic reactions may occur. All these effects quickly disappear when the drug is discontinued (Karp and Danova 1997). After 5 h since intravenous administration of DMPS, only 0.9% has been found free, 36.6% is associated with non-protein species. In contrast, the highest amount (62.5%) is found bonded to plasma proteins by a disulfide bond, in particular albumin (84%) and higher molecular weight proteins or aggregates (16%) (Maiorino et al. 1996). It has been suggested that these protein- and non-protein-DMPS species may prolong the chelation activity toward toxic metal ions, representing a reservoir of DMPS, which can be released by disulfide reduction in vivo. In tissues, the maximum concentration of DMPS is detected in the kidneys, the minimum in the brain. It is mainly found in the extracellular fluid, poorly permeating through cell membranes. DMPS is an effective antidote for many inorganic and organic As compounds, including arsenites, arsenates, arylarsenoxides, acetarsolum, etc. (Aposhian et al. 1981; Karp and Danova 1997). DMPS has been shown to reduce the half-life of As from liver tissues by 2.1 times, from whole blood by 12 times, and plasma 1.6 times. The effectiveness of treatment of acute and chronic toxic metal poisoning with one chelating agent is in many cases insufficient, so a number of authors have proposed multi-component poisoning therapy, the advantage of which is the possibility of using several drugs together in lower doses (it leads to the enhancement of overall effectiveness of the combined treatment). For example, when EDTA together with DMPS was given to mice after 1 h since cadmium chloride administration, 100% survival has been observed (Schubert and Derr 1978). The combination of DMSA and MiADMSA, respect to mono-therapy (DMSA alone), has been found to enhance As removal from hepatic tissue and prevent hepatic apoptosis, reducing oxidative stress efficiently, giving lower As concentrations in blood and soft tissues (Mishra et al. 2008). In a recent study, the use of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and DMSA was evaluated successfully in rats co-exposed to As and fluoride contaminated water. The combination therapy showed reduced As and F burden and oxidative stress (Mittal et al. 2018). The protocols for the treatment of acute poisoning, approved by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, recommend an internal administration of penicillamine in cases of As poisoning, combining it with Pyridoxine hydrochloride (1; 2.5; 5% solution), followed by gastric lavage (Vlasyk et al. 2009). The beneficial role of the combined chelation therapy with the commonly used iron (Fe) chelators deferasirox and deferiprone was also estimated for As poisoning showing its effectiveness in depleting As concentration from soft tissues in rats (Amiri and Mirhoseiny 2017; Nurchi et al. 2016). Chelation treatment appears a promising therapeutic measure as regards alleviation of symptoms for severe cases of chronic As poisonings (Gerhardsson and Aaseth 2016). In particular, in a study performed with a group of patients suffering from chronic As toxicity due to long term consumption of As-contaminated water demonstrated the efficacy of DMPS with a substantial improvement of neuropathy and lung symptoms respect to the group treated with placebo (Guha Mazumder et al. 2001), whereas DMSA has been found to be unsuccessful (Guha Mazumder et al. 1998).",

            "text": "The application of natural chemical chelators is one of the traditional methods of removing toxic metals from the body (Bhattacharya 2017). Natural antioxidants found in a correct diet as flavonoids, lipoic acid, carotenoids, vitamin C and E, taurine, gallic acid, curcumin, minerals, amino acids, etc. have shown beneficial effects in counteracting metal toxicity by increasing methylation capacity and free ROS scavenging. Medicinal plants currently attract the scientific interest as potential remedies in case of toxic metal poisoning due to their lesser adverse effects (Mehrandish et al. 2019), since their health benefits for humans are caused by the totality of secondary metabolites, including important antioxidant molecules flavonoids, accompanied by various macroelements and trace elements (Konieczynski et al. 2018) (Table 1). Flavonoids possess a number of properties ranging from in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, ROS scavengers activity, to chelation ability for metal ions (Cherrak et al. 2016; Chirumbolo et al. 2018; Fang et al. 2002; Korkina and Afanas'ev 1997). These polyphenols induce phase II detoxifying enzymes (e.g., glutathione S-transferase) and CYP (Cytochromes P450)-mediated detoxification, which is of significant impact on the inactivation of toxicants (Chirumbolo et al. 2018; Valko et al. 2006). A report on As-induced toxicity in Swiss albino mice treated with naringenin showed significant amelioration in the hematological and serum biochemical profiles and normalization of the hepatic and renal functions (Mershiba et al. 2013; Roy et al. 2014). Other examples include taurine, quercetin, silymarin, rutin, and the mixed polyphenolic flavonoids present in green tea leaves in exerting a protective action against As-caused damage through their antioxidant and chelating ability (Das et al. 2009; Sarkozi et al. 2015; Sharma and Flora 2018).",

Some significant correlations have been determined between the totality of flavonoids and Fe, Zn, and Mn content in the analyzed phytopharmaceuticals (Konieczynski et al. 2018). Total antioxidant capacity depends upon the activities of three enzymes: manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1), and catalase, which contribute to the removal of ROS since they are involved in a common detoxification pathway (Bastaki et al. 2006). The GPx1 enzyme functions as a homotetramer with Se and GSH as the cofactors, able to enzymatically reduce hydrogen and lipid peroxides, and result in the formation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (Bastaki et al. 2006; Brown et al. 2000; Lubos et al. 2011).",

Selenium counteracts and reduces the toxicity of heavy metals such as Hg, Cd, Pb, and hexavalent chromium in the body (Antonyak et al. 2008, 2018). The relieving action of Se against As toxicity, both in vitro and in vivo has also been investigated. Defense from oxidative injury due to As treatment has been demonstrated as a detoxification pathway by Se supplementation through the selenoproteins upregulation (GPx and thioredoxin reductase) (Rahman et al. 2019). The combination of As and Se enhanced antioxidant defense in As-treated PC12 cells, positively regulating autophagy and apoptosis (Rahman et al. 2018). Selenium-enriched diet caused higher fecal and urinary As excretion and reduction of its residues in kidneys with simultaneous improvement of the GSH levels and health indices in As-treated rats (Sah et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Currently, drug-induced nephrotoxicity is an important concern since the administration of nephrotoxic medicines is unavoidable in modern clinical practice (Kim and Moon 2012). Oxidative stress also contributes to the development of chronic renal disease, as unbalanced lipid peroxidation leads to endothelial dysfunction and loss of plasma SOD and GPx activity and Se levels (Dennis and Witting 2017). Arsenic, interacting with substances consisting of sulphydryl groups, restrains the GSH reductase and produces immoderate ROS in renal tissue (Ghabaee et al. 2017). GSH is involved in detoxification of ROS and xenobiotics via glutathione S-transferase conjugation (Dennis and Witting 2017; Ghabaee et al. 2017). Besides of detoxifying enzymes, processes of ROS scavenging also comprise signaling pathway Nrf2/Keap1/ARE. Some medicines of plant origin are known to be activators of the Nfr2 action (Bj\u00f8rklund et al. 2018). Treatment with Zn during gestation and lactation developed a protective effect in As-induced (5 mg/kg/day as sodium meta-arsenite) oxidative stress in rats\u2019 renal tissue, which was confirmed by the improvement of the malondialdehyde (MDA) and GSH levels, also as the histopathological changes (Bhardwaj and Dhawan 2019). Zinc improved renal antioxidant status in rats in the models of cyclosporine- and mercuric chloride-induced kidney damage (Ghabaee et al. 2017). The hepatoprotective effect of Zn alleviates chronic As poisoning also in aquatic species (Zhao et al. 2019).",

Several research studies demonstrate the perspectives for application in the treatment of heavy metals poisoning of the following herbal drugs: garlic, milk thistle, cilantro, ginkgo, turmeric, phytochelatins, triphala, some herbal fibers, and green algae (Bhattacharya 2017). Among them, Azadirachta indica (plant, Neem), Nigella Sativa (plant, black cumin), Allium sativum (plant, garlic) and Spirulina (algae) were evaluated in several clinical studies as remedies for As-induced keratosis in humans and were also successful as bioremediators in As exposed aquatic organisms or in reducing As-polluted wastewater (Roy et al. 2017; Sayed et al. 2019). Garlic, onion, leek, and chive, due to their content in organosulfur substances, contribute to detoxification of heavy metals such as Pb and As carried out by the liver (Mehrandish et al. 2019). Curcumin can reduce liver toxicity caused by heavy metals due to its significant antioxidant capacity and chelating ability (Mehrandish et al. 2019). Curcumin-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles (nano-curcumin) showed to combat As toxicity at a much lower dose compared to free curcumin (Yadav et al. 2012). Recently, synergistic therapeutic effects against As-generated oxidative stress were evidenced by the combinatorial drug delivery strategy employing nano-curcumin and nano-MiADMSA in rats (Kushwaha et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Arsenic and its compounds are used in technology and agriculture as pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides in many countries of the world. All this leads to environmental pollution, accumulation of As in groundwater, as well as the contamination of medicinal plants, agricultural products, and food. Cases of accidental or non-accidental poisoning of people by various mineral or organic compounds of As are not infrequent. Chelation therapy is used to treat different types of poisoning. A number of chelating agents are available, in particular, for the treatment of acute arsenicosis, whereas there is still no safe and effective antidote available for treating chronic As intoxication. The above discussion provides an insight into the therapeutic role of classical and new promising chelators in As-induced toxicity. Although there are a variety of chelating agents that have been tested in the treatment of As poisoning, their effectiveness is strongly related to the general health condition of the patient, mode of administration, dose, and resistance to biotransformation. Several strategies occur for the treatment of As poisoning, including monotherapy or a combination of structurally different chelating agents as well as co-administration of natural and synthetic antioxidants. Nano-drug delivery is currently evaluated as a promising future alternative to conventional chelators for its efficacy and safety. Nutritional factors play a critical role in antagonizing free radical species and increasing As methylation. The influence of a correct daily diet and/or the use of nutrient supplements (vitamins, micronutrients, proteins, etc.) helps to reduce the damages caused by arsenicosis and protect from chronic exposure, especially for peoples living in contaminated regions.",
