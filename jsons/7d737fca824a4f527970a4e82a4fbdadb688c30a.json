Such disorders include hemophilia A (Factor [F]VIII), hemophilia B (F IX), and von Willebrand disease (von Willebrand factor [VWF]); rarer disorders such as fibrinogen, FXIII, and FX deficiencies; and a number of acquired bleeding disorders. For von Willebrand disease, some rare bleeding disorders, and acquired bleeding, plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates, but not recombinant concentrates, are available. A four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (Kcentra [Beriplex P/N in Europe] , CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) has been recently approved in the United States for reversal of warfarin. 1 Efforts to prevent transmission of infectious agents were accelerated after the recognition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission to hemophilia patients in 1983 and the identification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) thereafter. By the 1990s, there was substantial clinical evidence of a lack of transmission of lipid membrane-enveloped viruses (hepatitis B [HBV] , HCV, and HIV) using solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment. 2 Nonenveloped viruses, including hepatitis A virus (HAV) and parvovirus B19 (B19V), presented additional challenges, as they are not inactivated by this technique. [3] [4] [5] In Germany, pasteurization (heating at 60\u00b0C for 10 hours in a stabilized aqueous solution) was developed in the late 1970s for a clotting factor concentrate as a dedicated virus reduction method; this FVIII and VWF concentrate was licensed in 1981 and no proven cases of virus transmissions were reported. 6 More recently, prion transmission has become a concern. 7-9 Manufacturing processes have evolved to include multiple steps to prevent transmission of both known and emerging blood-borne pathogens. 10 The objective of this review is to examine current methods to prevent pathogen transmission via plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates by state-of-the-art selection of plasma, and effective pathogen inactivation and removal by the manufacturing process.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 614, "end": 638, "text": "[Beriplex P/N in Europe]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 746, "end": 747, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1118, "text": "[HBV]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1177, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1344, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1348, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1352, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1659, "end": 1660, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1860, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Clotting factor concentrates are derived from pools consisting of large numbers of donations. 2 The fractionation pool size varies depending on the size of the vessel used to pool the plasma. A batch of final product can include several fractionation pools. Donor screening and testing of donations and fractionation pools are the first steps in product safety, followed by pathogen inactivation and/or removal (i.e., reduction) during manufacturing. Source plasma from apheresis commonly comes from compensated donors, while recovered plasma is from whole blood donors not compensated in cash. 11, 12 The manufacturing process of clotting factor concentrates from both starting materials and their safety records are virtually identical. 11, 12 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guideline focusing on the safety of plasma-derived products; 10 the fourth version details measures necessary to prevent transmission of viruses to recipients of plasmaderived products. These measures include selection of donors, screening of donations and plasma pools for markers of infection with known viruses, and a manufacturing process with a high capacity to inactivate and/or remove viruses by selected steps validated for their virus reduction capacity. The guidelines state that \"effective steps for the inactivation/removal of a wide range of viruses of diverse physicochemical characteristics\" are required during manufacture. Both the EMA and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that two distinct steps with complementary modes of action be used, 10, 13 helping to ensure that any virus surviving Step 1 is inactivated and/or removed in Step 2. At least one step should inactivate or remove nonenveloped viruses. The EMA guideline further states that if a manufacturing process contains a step that reliably inactivates and/or removes a wide range of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses and additional manufacturing steps reliably contribute to inactivation and/or removal of viruses, the second step might not be required. 10 In the United States, the manufacture of plasma-derived products must include at least one effective step for removal and/or inactivation of viruses. 14 Further, careful validation is required for each inactivation or removal step. Various methods of virus inactivation and removal used in concentrates available in many countries are presented in Table 1 .

[7] [8] [9] Although screening for viral markers by serology and virus nucleic acid by nucleic acid testing (NAT) ensures that nearly all plasma units entering production are free of HBV, HCV, and HIV, inactivation and removal steps are necessary to reduce any viruses that may enter the plasma pool during a \"window period\" before markers can be detected. 6 In 1999, it was estimated that this window for serologic testing could result in the identification of up to 1 in 10 plasma pools containing an HIV-infected unit and up to one in five containing an HBV-or HCV-infected unit. 2 For a particular NAT assay and pool configuration, NAT has been shown to decrease the diagnostic window from 22 to 11 days for HIV-1, 59 to 34 days for HBV, and 82 to 23 days for HCV, thereby decreasing the amount of virus entering the plasma pool for fractionation. 6 This reduces the residual risk by decreasing both the number of potentially infected units in the pool and the concentration of virus.
