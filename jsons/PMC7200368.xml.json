This provoked a reduction of domestic and international volumes of air passenger traffic to and from China in February (Iacus et al., 2020). Such effects are currently being observed in several regions worldwide. This has clear implications for the aviation industry as well as indirect consequences to several sectors (e.g. tourism) and the economy at large as well as the society. Through the use of historical air traffic data, real time flights tracks and on-line booking systems, this works aims to provide air traffic volume projections following a set of scenarios base on observed and previous crises. These range from a rapid and full recovery to less optimistic scenarios of slower or even incomplete recovery which will depend on the duration and intensity of the lock-down.",

The dataset is processed and provided by SABRE (SABRE, 2020). The latest available data point in time at the time of this writing is October 2019, a few months before the outbreak of COVID-19 Coronavirus, and starts on September 2010. The volume of air traffic passengers at global scale over the last decade is shown in Fig. 1\nwhere, besides the seasonal effect, an overall increasing trend can be observed. As mentioned, the data considered in our analysis consist of routes (international and domestic) from an origin airport to a destination airport around the world, i.e., itinerary which possibly consist of one or more stops. This aspect of the data has advantages and disadvantages. For example, in the previous analysis on China aviation (Iacus et al., 2020), while all direct flights from China to Italy were banned, using the on-line booking platforms explained later on, it was clearly seen from the data that 1-stop and 2-stop flights could guarantee the connections from China to Italy during February 2020. This aspect is important in the analysis of the pandemic outbreak. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to understand from the data if a route is a direct flight or not, without prior information and it is not possible to disentangle either whether a route contains a mix of direct and non-direct flights.",

Indeed, just as an example, the route HKG - TPE (Hong Kong - Taipei) has a maxP statistic equal to 229,316.

Every week, or half week (since March), we inquire for the flights along a specific route (origin airport - destination airport) for the number of flights available for the next 7 days. We scan systematically all the 222,557 routes. It turns out, for example, that around 1,000 unique connections from China have zero flights in the period 7-25 February 2020 and thus we take it as a proxy of the real number of routes temporary cancelled due to COVID-2019 outbreak.

Most modern large aircraft are visible in the tracking platforms, including both passenger and cargo planes.

For the forecast we use a non-homogeneous Poisson process with a periodic intensity function calibrated on historical data (Iacus and Yoshida, 2018) and extrapolated non-linearly for the future years, e.g., the time series of all January\u2019s from 2010 till 2019 is used to calibrate a regression model with quadratic terms and the value for 2020 is projected accordingly. The intensity function of the non-homogeneous Poisson process is therefore the combination over all periods. This approach is needed to take into account that air passengers volumes show non-linear trends and cycles which are specific to each route, so a model has been fitted for each route as well. Other approaches likes ARIMA or the alike can be used as well but we preferred to use pure counting processes rather than Gaussian processes.",

We provide then several scenarios that try to mimic the past airline traffic disruption occurred in previous pandemic episodes and we called Baseline scenario the one based on simple forecast based on the model of Section 3. Fig. 2\nshows the effect of past crisis (IATA, 2020) like the SARS-2003, MERS-2005 and others in terms of Revenue Passenger Kilometers\n5 (RPK) drop and the time to recover to the baseline status before the crises. The scenarios we propose here only mimic the patterns but do not correspond exactly to the past scenarios for at least two reasons: i) we consider air passenger volumes and not RPK and ii) the above past scenario are quasi-local while we consider global scenarios. In Fig. 2 we see the so-called U-shaped pattern of the SARS-2003, which has been the most serious epidemic impacting traffic volumes in the recent period. At the height of the outbreak (May 2003), monthly RPKs of Asia-Pacific airlines were about 35% lower than their pre-crisis levels. Overall in 2003, the loss of confidence and fears of global spread impacted both business and leisure travel to, from and within the region, resulting in Asia-Pacific airlines losing 8% of annual RPKs and lasted about 9 months. The MERS Flu in 2015 produced a 12% decline in monthly RPKs to, from and within South Korea in the first month of the outbreak. However, air travel volumes began to recover after two months and had returned to pre-outbreak levels within 6 months. On the other side, the two episodes of the avian flu in 2005 and 2013 did not affect the aviation market that much. As we know the COVID-19 is more global and impacting due to many restrictive measures imposed by countries and airlines, we will consider the SARS-2003 and the MERS-2015 patterns only for our scenario and we add two other scenarios: one, called COVID-12, which goes as low as 50% and recovers in 12 months and the COVID-L (ell-shaped scenario) which is the same as COVID but never get back to the original volume and returns only at 60%. Fig. 3\nrepresents the different hypothesized scenarios. Another scenario, called the Observed scenario, is based on the analysis of the booking data presented in Section 2.2. In this scenario, we discount the number of forecast passengers along a route if we observed no direct flights or no 1-stop flights, which means we assign zero passengers on that route. Up to March 2019 we are able to adjust this Observed scenario accordingly for all the routes monitored. Finally we a set of additional three scenarios based on the Eurocontrol air traffic data Eurocontrol (2018) which provide global average air volumes up to date. The scenario are called EUROC, EUROC-12 (recovering in 12 months) and EUROC-L (L-shaped version). There are two differences between the EUROC* scenarios and the Observed scenario: i) we do not project the Observed scenario after March 2020 and ii) the observed scenario are calculated by route, while the EUROC* scenarios are global estimates.",

If the global aviation sector were a country, its total contribution (direct, indirect, induced and catalytic) of USD 2.7 trillion to the gross domestic product (GDP), and the 65.5 million jobs it supports, would be comparable to the United Kingdom\u2019s economic size and population\u201d. In 2018, the official statistics report as much as 4.3 billion passengers, while in our SABRE data we calculated 3,773,950,899 (thus 87.7% of the IATA official datum). In our selection of routes for which forecast and scenario calculation was possible, we observed 3,580,700,282 passengers, therefore 94.8% of the whole SABRE data and 83.2% of the official IATA datum. The total number of jobs supported by aviation is 65.5 million according to IATA (2019). According to recent estimates by the cross-industry Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), the total economic impact (direct, indirect, induced and tourism-connected) of the global aviation industry reached USD 2.7 trillion, about 3.6 per cent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016. On a global scale, the distribution of jobs aviation-related/induced and GDP impact is summarized in Table 1\n. Although the direct causal effect is beyond the scope of this short note, we can apply the different scenarios to roughly evaluate the potential socio-economic impact of the flight ban along 2020 due to the COVID-2019 crisis as well as the loss in terms of revenues as measured by airfares that we can observed in our SABRE data, also forecast according to the historical observed average fare per route trough simple seasonal regression model. In Table 1, the direct impact is about the overall economic activity, jobs creation that directly serve passengers at airlines, airports and air navigation services providers. These include check-in, baggage handling, on-site retail, cargo and catering facilities. But also include, jobs related to the manufacturing sector (those companies that produce aircraft, engines and other vital technologies). The indirect impact concerns the employment and economic activity generated by suppliers to the aviation industry: aviation fuel suppliers, etc. The induced impact is the spending of those directly or indirectly employed in the aviation sector supports additional jobs in other sectors such as retail outlets, companies producing consumer goods and a range of service industries (for example, banks, telecommunication providers and restaurants). Finally, tourism catalytic is related to air transport activities that affect multiple sectors of the economy, especially tourism and its value chain (hotels, restaurants, etc).",

On a global scale, we can notice only a little difference between the Baseline scenario (nothing has happened) and the Observed scenario till the end of March. But if we look at specific situations, like e.g. Italy, we see that the observed number of flights decreases towards the hypothesized scenarios (see Fig. 5\n). Table 2\nestimates the loss by quarter compared to the baseline forecast. Values are in million of US$. Assuming that a reduction of direct revenues / passengers may impact the entire aviation sector proportionally, we can roughly estimates the expected number of job losses and impact on GDP at global scale. We assume that reduction has a 100% impact, but clearly any other rescaling and more accurate factors will give more precise figures. The results are shown in Table 3\n. It turns out that for the first Quarter of 2020, the Observed travel ban impacts 0.02% of the overall GDP and 0.12% under the EUROC scenario, i.e., it has generated a loss of $3.3 billion and $24 billion respectively. Considering the whole year 2020, in the worst scenario (EUROC-L) the global impact can go up to 1.67%, about $323 billion. As tourism catalytic is 56% of the global impact of aviation on the economy, one can rescale the results accordingly to estimate the impact on tourism-related impact. In terms of impact on the society, we can see from Table 3 that the number of job losses may vary by 310,000 units for the first quarter of 2020 under the Observed scenario and 2.2 million under the EUROC scenario, and up to 30.3 million worldwide under the worst scenario EUROC-L.",

To this end, we collected aircraft departures (i.e. take-offs) from January to March 2020 for 141 airports. The criteria for selecting these 141 airports was a balance between air passenger traffic, geographical coverage and data availability. OpenSky Network was selected since it provides open access to historical flight data. However, the limitation of this source is that it does not provide global coverage and it cover mostly for Europe and North America. For example, flight data for major global airports such as the Beijing Capital International Airport in China and the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Indonesia are not available.",

(2020) suggested that \u201cThe overall duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic could last into 2022\u201d. In our analysis we assume that, in most scenarios, by December 2020 the aviation recovers its previous business levels;\u2022measures such as national and regional lock-downs have a major impact on the aviation and the temporal length of these measures cannot be foreseen and may vary across different regions and countries. Countries have different lock-down strategies from extreme lock-downs as in China/Wuhan, mild lock-downs in Europe and (early) light lock-downs in the UK, USA. Lock-downs aims at postponing the epidemic wave (\u201cflattening the curve\u201d) to reduce pressure on the health system. Different lock-down strategies impact the duration of pandemic and thus the impact on the aviation. Our scenarios should be intended as the result of an average of all these measures on a global scale;\u2022in our scenarios we assume that no second wave of Sars-CoV-2 epidemic will happen building on the past experience from Sars-2003 and Mers-2013. However, this is a new virus and could have a different seasonal behaviour;\u2022the start and the end of the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on aviation differs and it will differ (given the different strategies in place) across different countries. Once again, our scenarios should be considered as average effects.\u2022the multipliers used to evaluate the impact of aviation on GDP and jobs are quite approximated as we do not take into account any macro-economic (supply/demand) model. A sector by sector analysis is required to have precise figures. Nevertheless, the emerging figures are in line with other simulations (e.g. JRC-Unit-B5, 2020).\n",
