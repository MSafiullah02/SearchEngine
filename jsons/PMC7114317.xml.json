Modern travel and trade have further dissipated traditional geographical boundaries that once curbed the spread of disease. Infectious agents capable of spreading from human to human, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, have shown us just how quickly (in a matter of weeks) a threat anywhere could become a threat everywhere [1]. The lessons learnt from SARS, avian flu and the anthrax letter attacks have emphasized the need for improved preparedness for, response to and treatment of both known and emergent biological threats 2, 3. This has also prompted heightened funding initiatives worldwide to build up national and international biodefence capabilities [3].",

The intrinsic ability of microarrays to perform multiplexed, low-volume and sensitive biological assays in a highly scalable manner is a significant advantage in biological threat analysis [4]. Developed in the early to mid 1990s, DNA microarrays stirred a technological revolution that continues to propel genomics research today [5]. Applications included the identification and comparison of mRNA or DNA from across tissues or organisms by hybridization against thousands of oligomeric DNA probes immobilized on planar surfaces, such as glass slides (Figure 1\n). This provided researchers with an unprecedented ability to quantify genome-wide differences in gene expression or sequence changes using minimal amounts of sample. In the context of biodefence, these studies have dramatically extended our capability beyond merely detecting known pathogens; now we are able to rapidly profile and characterize pathogens, as well as identify novel strains or \u2018genetic islands\u2019 that manifest changes in virulence (or the evolution of resistance). Such comparative phylogenomic profiling using microarrays facilitates the understanding of pathogen diversification by providing a bird's-eye view of the gene content present or absent within a given microbial genome [6].",

DNA-based detection systems generally rely on the ability of PCR to amplify and fluorescently tag the tiny amounts of target DNA present in the specimen. Advances in miniaturizing this initial PCR step, for instance the development of micro-PCR (\u03bcPCR), followed by hybridization and identification against probes on DNA microarrays have spun-off viable chip-based platforms that are able to successfully perform biological threat detection and analysis. Such portable systems, as will be described, are already appearing on the market and competing to attract lucrative biodefence funding. Alternative detection platforms have exploited quantitative PCR in \u2018fieldable\u2019 real-time detectors, where positive PCR amplification would indicate the presence of the corresponding target DNA [4]. These have included devices such as GeneXpert (Cepheid), Rapid (Idaho Technologies) or BioSeeq (Smiths Detection), but these systems provide relatively limited throughput [7]. Microarray systems are, by contrast, more definitive and highly scalable because hundreds to tens of thousands of possible DNA elements can be interrogated in a single experiment. Their performance nevertheless hinges on both the adoption of robust panels of probes that can accurately identify DNA from organisms of interest and the successful extraction and amplification of pathogen DNA from the relevant clinical sample or isolates 8, 9.",

These issues and considerations include cross-hybridizations, orthogonal probe binding to target DNA from the specific organism(s) of interest and vice versa, uniformity of annealing temperatures (or GC content) and probe length. The occurrence of false positives and false negatives is highly problematic because they might cause an unwarranted response (and potentially panic) or a missed response (and a lost opportunity for intervention), which are unacceptable when dealing with deadly biological threats. For this reason, biodefence detection platforms strive to reach near perfect accuracies, which are comparable to, if not better than, the usual gold-standard assays \u2013 typically culture-based methods. With microarrays, redundancy can, however, be easily engineered into the system to improve accuracy and analytical power simply by over-representation.",

            "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have identified a list of 36 agents that, if spread uncontrollably, have the potential to cause a major public health crisis with heavy morbidity and mortality rates (Box 1\n). These pathogens are further subclassified into Categories A, B and C according to the degree of risk imposed (Table 1\n) [16]. In 2002, Wilson et al. fabricated a customized Affymetrix microarray containing 53 660 probes to detect DNA amplified from 18 different pathogenic microorganisms simultaneously, including pathogens from the US CDC's list of bioterrorism agents, such as Bacillus anthracis (which causes anthrax), Clostridium botulinum (which generates the botulinum toxin), Yersinia pestis (which causes bubonic plague) and the Ebola virus [17]. Specific multiplexed primer sets were designed to amplify unique diagnostic regions specific to each organism for hybridization against tiling arrays comprising 20-mer probes. The highly redundant system facilitated the accurate identification of each organism tested, with over 91% of the probes working as predicted. Impressively, as little as 10 fg, equivalent to the \u2018mass\u2019 of just two genomes (or DNA from two cells), of B. anthracis could be detected after multiplexed PCR on these microarrays.Box 1Bioterror agent classificationBiohazardous agents that pose a significant threat require special attention, especially in the implementation of regulatory measures and controls to limit their access and distribution and to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. In addition, such measures also aim to raise awareness within national healthcare systems and amongst healthcare providers, especially in cases where these bioterror threats are only rarely seen. The US Centers of Disease Control (CDC) have compiled a list of 36 biohazardous agents, which are divided into the categories A, B and C according to the level of threat they impose, and their characteristics are described here. Examples of pathogens from these three categories are provided in Table 1.Category A (highest priority agents)The CDC defines Category A agents as those that are of the highest priority for biodefence research. These organisms can be easily disseminated from person to person. They result in high mortality rates and have the potential to cause a major impact on public health. The accidental or deliberate release of these agents could cause public panic and social disruption. These agents thus require particular attention in ensuring public health preparedness because they pose a significant risk to national security.Category B (second highest priority agents)The CDC defines Category B agents as those that are moderately easy to disseminate. These pathogens result in moderate morbidity and low mortality. These agents would hence require specific improvements of diagnostic capabilities as well as enhanced measures for disease surveillance.Category C (third highest priority agents)The CDC defines Category C agents as those that have the potential for mass dissemination in the future because of their availability, ease of production and dissemination. This category also includes emergent threats that have the potential of causing high morbidity and mortality rates, as well as a major impact on public health.Further details on the classification and prioritization of biological threat agents are available on the CDC website: http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp.",

Molecular identification using random PCR followed by multiplexed resolution over a microarray offers a particularly attractive alternative for detection and diagnostics, generating results in 2\u20136 h once assays are optimized (Figure 2a). Wang et al.\n[18] developed such a microarray approach for the screening of viral pathogens from across broad viral families. A randomized primer was used to amplify any viral RNA that was present in the sample using reverse transcriptase-PCR followed by hybridization on a microarray comprising 1600 70-mer probes, representing nearly 140 virus genomes. Degeneracy of probes on the microarray and cross-hybridization of certain viruses across expected patterns indicated the emergence of novel, uncharacterized strains, which could hence be identified with the aid of microarrays. Similarly, Sengupta and colleagues [19] developed microarrays with 476 probes to distinguish among various influenza viruses. Primers were designed against characteristic sequences specific to influenza that targeted the viral fusion protein haemagglutinin and the glycosidase neuraminidase segments. Using the Affymetrix respiratory pathogen microarray, Lin et al.\n[20] detected the respiratory viruses influenza A and adenovirus, which were then further differentiated according to strain and species. This setup made use of a so-called \u2018resequencing\u2019 microarray that contained one perfectly matched and three mismatched probes per base and thus was able to identify genetic mutations at the sequence level [20]. The array's large screening capacity meant that both the forward and reverse strands of the DNA targets could be sequenced to provide added sequencing accuracy. Pooled primer pairs have also been optimized for use in detecting both DNA and RNA targets for pathogens that cause upper respiratory tract infections, including viruses (influenza, corona viruses and others) and bacteria (Bordetella pertusis, Streptococcus pyogenes and others) [21].",

The array fluorescence intensities correlated well with the spiked pathogen concentrations, providing a means of quantifying the pathogen levels in the original sample. A similar method was used to detect Staphylococci. Out of 201 isolates taken from 33 Staphylococci species, 185 were correctly assigned by using only 16S rRNA sequences on microarrays, conferring a sensitivity of 92% [24].

Wang et al.\n[32] also developed a SARS microarray that helped to characterize a novel coronavirus variant. The microarray platform is thus ideal in virus tracking should outbreaks occur and, furthermore, is readily applicable to other pathogens with manageably sized genomes, including smallpox [33]. In an impressive demonstration that extended beyond the smaller viral genomes, Zwick et al.\n[29] developed resequencing microarrays for the anthrax bacterium; a total of 115 resequencing arrays, each capable of calling 29 212 bases, gave 92.6% coverage of the 3.3 Mb B. anthracis genome.",

Bearing identical 16S rRNA sequences, more comprehensive genetic analysis was required to understand the differences in disease morbidity manifested by these two bacterial species, as well as in the different modes of transmission to humans: Y. pestis by flea bites and Y. pseudotuberculosis by food or water. A microarray specific for Y. pestis revealed three unique genomic islands and the inactivation of several genes, including those encoding the cell-adhesion proteins adhesin (yadA) and invasion (inv), as well as the O-antigen biosynthetic operon. These unique characteristics potentially led to Y. pestis\u2019 enhanced virulence and its adaptation from an enteric organism (Y. pseudotuberculosis) to a mammalian blood-borne pathogen [35]. Equivalent findings were reported by Hinchliffe et al.\n[36] using a similar Y. pestis gene-specific microarray.

In an interesting approach to reveal molecular mechanisms for pathogenesis, Weiss and colleagues [38] developed a microarray-based negative-screening approach for Francisella and obtained surviving bacterial samples from infected mice to reveal genes responsible for bacterial survival and growth in vivo. In a related study, genome-wide microarrays also revealed loci that are only present in the highly virulent Franscicella tularensis subspecies tularensis strain [39]. These loci could be used to identify potential pathogenicity islands as well as to provide unique genetic markers that could be used for strain typing and identification. Microarrays have also been applied to distinguish among variants of influenza A that are resistant to the antiviral drug amantidine by detecting mutations in the viral ion channel M2 protein [40].

Project Silent Guardian was a 10-week trial launched by the Naval Research Laboratory during the 2005 US Presidential Inauguration [41]. The challenge was to take laboratory-based microarray technology to a production-scale system capable of operationally screening up to 300 samples per day. A custom DNA microarray was designed with the capability of detecting 20 natural (including avian flu) and biothreat agents with strain-level resolution. In total, 10 000 samples were collected and screened by civilian and military laboratory personnel within the stipulated period. The trial included blinded samples that were spiked with pathogens, which were all successfully detected. This exercise showcased the feasibility of implementing microarrays as a screening tool for EOS and demonstrated their use as a rapid and robust means of sample processing and pathogen identification. Recommendations from the study included the development of a more user-friendly system with greater automation of the steps involved. These features are being incorporated by several recently launched commercial platforms. Microarray-based platforms for biothreat screening from Akonni Biosystems (http://www.akonni.com) and Veredus Laboratories (http://www.vereduslabs.com) are now on the market for multiplexed threat detection. New advances include (i) greater integration of the sample preparation (which is considered to be one of the major bottlenecks), (ii) the use of \u03bcPCR and (iii) the development of small handheld microfluidic chips and portable readers to take microarray technology to the point-of-care. Veredus has also recently launched an influenza test chip that enables the amplification and discrimination of influenza A and B subtypes, including avian flu (H5N1), within just two hours. This great improvement in detection time has been attributed to the \u03bcPCR step, which, through rapid thermocycling, significantly reduces the duration of PCR to under 30 min. Similar devices might be developed in the future for protein and other types of non-DNA microarrays for applications in serodiagnostics.",

As a next-generation tool, antibody microarrays are increasing in popularity, and not without reason, for they offer unparalleled throughput, minimal reagent consumption and sensitive detection of multiple targets simultaneously [10]. The accuracy conferred is nevertheless closely linked with the quality of antibodies employed, and there are issues relating to cross-reactivity and antibody availability, both of which are particularly crucial for finer and more accurate strain typing. Notwithstanding these matters, a plethora of antibody microarrays have been developed that have growing potential for clinical, biothreat and point-of-care applications (Figure 2c). Rucker et al.\n[43] applied antibody microarrays for the detection of toxins with low-nanomolar sensitivities, such as anthrax lethal factor (LF, a metalloendopeptidase), protective antigen (PA) and tetanus toxins (endopeptidases), through the co-application of a competitive fluorescently-labelled toxin reporter. In this setting, the samples can be tested without the need for labelling by monitoring the depletion and competitive displacement of reporter signals generated by the labelled reporter. Thirty-five antibodies were also arrayed to subtype the 20 most common Salmonella serovars [44], and a similar study was undertaken for Escherichia coli\n[45]. In an impressive demonstration of the detection throughput attainable, Huelseweh and colleagues [46] built an antibody microarray to detect several Category A and B agents simultaneously, including F. tularensis, Y. pestis, Brucella melitensis (which causes brucellosis) and B. mallei, using sandwich immunoassays (Figure 2c).",

            "text": "Conversely, antigen microarrays have also been used to identify seropositive individuals by using the presence of defensive antibodies in the serum as a means of detecting exposure to a pathogen. Pathogen proteins are typically orthologously expressed using high-throughput cloning and expression and then affinity purified to provide protein sets. In special cases, it might be necessary to consider the post-translational modifications or the way the pathogen presents itself to the host to identify and use the correct immunogenic protein variants in serodiagnostics. It is also desirable to purify the protein and check for efficient and generally uniform immobilization on the microarrays as a quality control, especially when comparisons are made across slides. In one such example, Sundaresh et al.\n[47] narrowed down an initial panel of 1741 F. tularensis antigens to just the top 244 in terms of their ability to predictively discriminate seropositive sera and then used these antigens to establish a diagnostic microarray comprising whole proteins. Mezzasoma et al.\n[48] also developed protein microarrays for simultaneous diagnostics using parasitic and viral antigens. Zhu et al.\n[49] monitored the antibody profiles of SARS patients using protein microarrays containing 82 purified coronavirus proteins. Antibodies present in human serum samples were detected on the protein microarrays with fluorescently labelled goat anti-human immunoglobulins. It was found that immunoreactivity against the coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins remained high for 120\u2013320 days post infection. This provided a means to check for exposure long after infection might have occurred. Over 400 human sera samples were screened with an accuracy of 91% in differentiating infected and normal specimens [49]. Nevertheless, caution should be applied in protein-based diagnostics because incubation periods vary greatly amongst diseases. During the incubation period, the patient might not express antibodies at detectable levels but might still be capable of spreading the infection. In the case of SARS, the incubation period (the time between exposure and onset of symptoms) has a median of 4\u20135 days (up to a maximum of 10 days). Antibodies might be detectable only 6\u20137 days after first symptoms are presented, but PCR testing might be able to pick up the virus more quickly, just 1\u20132 days after symptoms become apparent. It might become possible in the future to integrate DNA- and protein-based microarray methods to extend the range of rapid clinical diagnostics from detection of current pathogen infections to testing for exposure long after the actual infection has occurred.",

Lipopolysaccharide, carbohydrate-based and whole-cell microarrays have also been used for antibody-based detection of pathogens such as F. tularensis\n51, 52, B. anthracis\n[53] and B. pseudomallei\n[54]. The surface antigens on these microbes are frequently responsible for immunoreactivity, so these methods rely on detecting the presence of such immunogenic antigens.

(b) Antibody microarrays can be used to detect pathogen proteins or antigens that might be present in environmental samples as an indication of contamination or for diagnostic purposes to determine pathogen infection in human tissues. (c) Small-molecule microarrays offer novel approaches for differentiating between pathogens, for example by clustering the binding signatures obtained for each pathogen. They can also be used to identify therapeutics that could potentially disrupt the infection cycle.",

            "text": "Figure 2: The use of microarrays for studying emergent pathogens, exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus and avian influenza (H5N1). Various approaches have been developed for detection and diagnostics with DNA and protein microarrays. (a) Specific DNA probes, for instance Co-V (orange) for SARS and H5 (green) for H5N1, can be used to detect the presence of pathogen DNA or RNA using PCR or reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, thus enabling multiple pathogens to be detected simultaneously [26]. (b) Tiling arrays can be used to resequence pathogens so that any mutations in evolving pathogens can be rapidly detected and tracked. As illustrated, four probes, one for each nucleotide base, are used to determine the genotype at a given loci. A set of probes designed for an arbitrary position XYZ is shown to reveal the unknown base to be adenine (A). Multiple probe sets are \u2018tiled\u2019 across the whole pathogen genome and, upon hybridization and analysis, can confer the complete sequence information of the pathogen with great accuracy 17, 23, 25. (c) Antibody arrays make use of the sandwich immunoassay to screen for the presence of a pathogen. As depicted, the pathogen sample is first applied to the microarray, followed by the reporter antibody. As a result, the pathogen is sandwiched in between two antibodies \u2013 an immobilized antibody (blue) and a tagged antibody (purple) capable of reporting the presence of a pathogen on the microarray 43, 45. (d) Proteome microarrays, which contain immobilized proteins from the target pathogen, can be screened against sera obtained from infected individuals. If the individual has been exposed to the pathogen, the sera will contain antibodies (blue) against specific antigens of the pathogens that will react with the immobilized protein and that can be detected using tagged secondary antibodies (purple) [49]. This procedure also facilitates the identification of specific immunodominant antigens present in the pathogen proteome. These proteins are considered to be largely responsible for triggering the host immune response and thus have a high potential for the development of vaccines against this particular pathogen.",
