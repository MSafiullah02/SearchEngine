            "text": "Abstract Purpose: Severe bronchiolitis is the leading cause of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) has become the primary respiratory support, replacing invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Our objective was to evaluate the economic and clinical consequences following implementation of this respiratory strategy in our unit. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of 525 infants with bronchiolitis requiring respiratory support and successively treated during two distinct periods with invasive MV between 1996 and 2000, P1 (n = 193) and nCPAP between 2006 and 2010, P2 (n = 332). Costs were estimated using the hospital cost billing reports. Results: Patients' baseline characteristics were similar between the two periods. P2 is associated with a significant decrease in the length of ventilation (LOV) (4.1 \u00b1 3.5 versus 6.9 \u00b1 4.6 days, p \\ 0.001), PICU length of stay (LOS) (6.2 \u00b1 4.6 versus 9.7 \u00b1 5.5 days, p \\ 0.001) and hospital LOS. nCPAP was independently associated with a shorter duration of ventilatory support than MV (hazard ratio 1.8, 95 % CI 1.5-2.2, p \\ 0.001). nCPAP was also associated with a significant decrease in ventilation-associated complications, and less invasive management. The mean cost of acute viral bronchiolitis-related PICU hospitalizations was significantly decreased, from 17,451 to 11,205 \u20ac (p \\ 0.001). Implementation of nCPAP led to a reduction of the total annual cost of acute viral bronchiolitis hospitalizations of 715,000 \u20ac. Conclusion: nCPAP in severe bronchiolitis is associated with a significant improvement in patient management as shown by the reduction in invasive care, LOV, PICU LOS, hospital LOS, and economic burden.",

Criteria for inclusion in the cohorts were admission in the PICU for severe acute bronchiolitis and acute respiratory failure or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related apnea events requiring ventilatory support, either in invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) or nCPAP mode. Exclusion criteria included acute bronchiolitis stabilized with nasal oxygen supplementation only and patients with missing data.

The PCR viral status, use of antibiotics, and pulmonary radiologic abnormalities on chest X-ray were also included. The Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score was systematically calculated at both hospital and PICU admission, and was also collected. PICU stay data included measurements of maximum PCO 2 and minimum SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio on the first day of admission. All invasive studies and access were collected, such as number of labs and chest X-rays during the PICU stay, and the need of central venous lines.

There is a significant change in the global management of these infants and the major change in practice is the modification of ventilatory support with the use of a pre-emptive nCPAP strategy in severe bronchiolitis. This new management is associated with a significant improvement in supportive care as reflected by a dramatic reduction of the use of invasive mechanical ventilation, length of any respiratory support, PICU and hospital LOS, and economic burden. Severe acute bronchiolitis is a potentially life-threatening respiratory condition that affects infants in predictable seasonal epidemics. Hospital admission rates in the USA and Europe are reported to be between 20 and 30 per 1,000 for children under 1 year [8] [9] [10] . PICU admission rates range from 4 to 15 % for healthy infants and this percentage increases accordingly with the presence of comorbidities [11] . The treatment of severe bronchiolitis is mainly supportive [12] . Invasive ventilation is still frequently used to support these infants, but it is associated with significant airway and infectious adverse events [13] . In observational studies, early use of nCPAP was associated with a significant decrease in both RR and PCO 2 , suggesting that nCPAP might be an effective ventilation strategy in moderate to severe bronchiolitis with a low rate of failure [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . In addition, nCPAP failure does not seem to be associated with a worse evolution. Moreover, recent physiological studies demonstrated that severe bronchiolitis is associated with increased work of breathing, as reflected by high levels of diaphragmatic and esophageal pressure-time products, and significantly improved with application of a continuous PEEP [7, 21, 22] . To our knowledge, this is the first study which clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic benefit of nCPAP in severe acute bronchiolitis. This large observational cohort study, with more than 300 cases of nCPAP, found that nCPAP is independently associated with a shorter duration of ventilatory support, PICU LOS, and hospital LOS. These findings confirm previous observational studies which showed a similar reduction in time of ventilatory support of 2-3 days [17, 18, 23] .",

Children are four times more sensitive than adults to the ionizing radiation with an accordingly elevated risk of delayed cancer, given their more active cell proliferation. Shu et al.

Bronchiolitis with fever has been associated with a lower risk of bacteremia (0.2 %) compared to children with a fever of unknown origin (2-7 %) [25] . Although antimicrobial therapy is no longer recommended for bronchiolitis, it is commonly used in hospitalized children, with a rate varying widely between 34 and 99 % For each PICU stay, the billing cost was assessed using the hospital cost accounting reports given per day of stay [26, 27] . In addition, infants with bronchiolitis requiring invasive mechanical ventilation have high rates of bacterial co-infection varying from 21 to 26 % [28, 29] and Kneyber et al. [29] reported antibiotic usage reaching 95 % in these setting. In our series, the decrease in antibiotics use from 58 to 30 %, between the two periods, is partly due to increased physician awareness of the potential harmful effects of antibiotic selection pressure. Nevertheless, we could not exclude a relationship between increasing use of nCPAP as a standard of care and the decrease in healthcare-associated pneumonia from 24 to 10 % [26] . Similarly, in adults, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was shown to decrease significantly the rate of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia from 20 to 8 % [30] . This study highlights the fact that although there has been a change in the approach to ventilator support over time, there has also been a significant change in many aspects of the overall management of PICU patients between those two decades that can moderate the conclusion.",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis is known to be the leading cause of hospitalization for infants less than 1 year old, but data on the economic burden of bronchiolitis hospitalizations are limited. In 2002, in the USA, bronchiolitis hospitalizations accounted for 21.1 % of children less than 1 year old with an annual direct medical cost of approximately $543 million. Younger age, male gender, mechanical ventilation, and co-diagnosis of pneumonia were all markers predictive of higher hospitalization cost and longer hospital LOS [31] . The use of NIV in adults with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive disease significantly increased between 1998 and 2008 and was associated with clinical improvement and decrease in LOS [32] . To our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the economic impact of nCPAP in children. ICU admissions for severe bronchiolitis comprise only a small proportion of all bronchiolitis cases, but account for a larger proportion of all bronchiolitis-related hospitalization charges. In the USA, some authors demonstrate that bronchiolitis managed with invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with costs 6-9 times higher than when managed without any ventilatory support [33] [34] [35] . In this study, we further demonstrate that nCPAP is a costeffective strategy with a trend to reduction of the total economic burden, mostly owing to a significant decrease in PICU and hospital LOS as actual individual costs could not be measured.",

Thus, this large descriptive study, even with some methodological limitations, highlights that nCPAP used as a pre-emptive treatment strategy is associated with significant reduction of the percentage of invasive ventilation requirement and treatment invasiveness. The percentage of patients without any ventilatory support remains stable over the whole period, before the use of nCPAP and after the implementation of nCPAP as a pre-emptive ventilatory strategy in our unit (Fig. 1 ). This suggests that the nCPAP was not used for infants who in fact did not require any ventilatory support and allowed us to suggest that nCPAP is associated with a reduction of the total economic burden of severe bronchiolitis. We chose to analyze this effect in two different periods because, as shown in Fig. 1 ",
