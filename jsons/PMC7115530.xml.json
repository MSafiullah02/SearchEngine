            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause a number of respiratory tract and gastroenteritis diseases in human and animals [1]. Coronaviruses can be classified into three main groups: alphacoronavirus (group 1), betacoronavirus (group 2), and gammacoronavirus (group 3), while the group 2 is further sub-divided into group 2a and 2b [2]. In addition to the SARS-CoV (group 2b) that caused the outbreak of pneumonia in 2003, the four human group 1 (229E and NL63) and 2 (OC43 and HKU1) strains are associated with up to 5% of respiratory tract disease cases reported [3], [4]. The single-stranded RNA genome of CoVs encodes two polyproteins, which are processed into at least 15 mature proteins by papain-like protease and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) [5], [6]. Inhibition of the proteolytic processing can reduce viral replication and viral-induced cytotoxic effect [5], [6]. The ability of coronaviruses to generate novel strains with high virulence through high frequency of mutations and recombination remains a potential threat to human health. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a broad-spectrum drug that can combat against all kinds of coronavirus infection. Because 3CLpro is essential to viral replication and its active-site structure is conserved, the protease is an attractive drug target for the development of such a broad-spectrum inhibitor [7]. The SARS-CoV 3CLpro can be inactivated by peptidomimetic inhibitors that are composed of a substrate-like peptide and a reactive warhead such as an aldehyde [8], [9], a Michael acceptor [7], [10], [11], a halo-methyl ketone [10], [12], or an epoxide [13]. The peptide interacts with the substrate-binding cleft of the protease to form a non-covalent complex, and then the warhead covalently links with the catalytic cysteine residue and inhibits the enzyme.",

The protease activity in the presence of inhibitors was measured by using a fluorescent-protein substrate as described previously [14], [15]. The IC50 values of \u2018Mic-AVLQ-CN\u2019, \u2018Boc-AVLQ-CN\u2019, and \u2018Cbz-AVLQ-CN\u2019 were 49 \u00b1 2, 49 \u00b1 2, and 4.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 1\n). Interestingly, the inhibitor with the Cbz protective group was \u223c10x more potent than the other inhibitors tested. To test the effect of increasing the length of the peptidomimetic inhibitor, we synthesized a hexapeptide inhibitor \u2018Cbz-TSAVLQ-CN\u2019. The IC50 value for this inhibitor was 39 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM (Fig. 1), suggesting that increasing the length of the inhibitor did not improve inhibition and the Cbz group at the P4 position may be responsible for the higher potency of \u2018Cbz-AVLQ-CN\u2019.",

The 3CLpro formed a dimer in the crystal structure, and the inhibitors occupied the substrate binding site in both protomers. Electron density was observed for the tetrapeptide (Ala\u2013Val\u2013Leu\u2013Gln) at P1 to P4 positions for all inhibitor complexes (Fig. S1, Supplementary material). Overlaying these inhibitor structures demonstrated that the tetrapeptides adopted the same conformation when bound to the 3CLpro.

The side chains of P1-Gln, P2-Leu and P4-Ala occupied the S1, S2 and S4 subsites, respectively, of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, while the side-chain of P3-Val pointed towards the solvent (Fig. 2A).

            "text": "In this study, we have shown that nitrile-based peptidomimetic inhibitors display broad-spectrum inhibition against 3CLpro from all groups of coronaviruses. Crystal structures of enzyme\u2013inhibitor complexes provide interesting insights in the design of peptidomimetic inhibitors. First, the enzyme\u2013inhibitor binding is mainly determined by the tetrapeptide sequence, AVLQ. This suggestion is consistent with the observation that extending the length of the inhibitor to hexapeptide (\u2018Cbz-TSAVLQ-CN\u2019) did not improve inhibition (Fig. 1). Second, we found that the Cbz protective group at the N-terminus of the tetrapeptide can result in \u223c10 fold increases in potency in the \u2018Cbz-AVLQ-CN\u2019 inhibitor than the other inhibitors tested. This observation suggests that modification of the peptidomimetics, e.g. cross-linking the P3-Val with the Cbz groups, may further improve the efficacy of inhibition. Because of the high recombination frequency among the RNA genome of CoVs, development of a broad-spectrum inhibitor is an attractive strategy to combat against infection of all kinds of CoVs [7]. Here, we have shown that the nitrile-based inhibitor \u2018Cbz-AVLQ-CN\u2019 can inhibit 3CLpro from all groups of CoVs tested with IC50 values in the \u03bcM range. As nitrile-based protease inhibitors (e.g. odanacatib [18], vildagliptin [19]) have been successful in clinical applications [20], our work demonstrated that the inhibitors described in this study may serve as a lead for the developmentof antiviral drugs that target a broad-spectrum of coronaviruses.",
