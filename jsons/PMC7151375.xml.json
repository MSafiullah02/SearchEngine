Although high quality data is not available, market research suggests that 1.5 million people now climb indoors in the United Kingdom every year, with this number increasing 15 to 20% each year (unpublished report commissioned by the Association of British Climbing Walls, 2019). This is in parallel with the rising public profile of climbing epitomized by the Oscar winning documentary \u2018Free Solo\u2019 and its inclusion in the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.",

These same holds are shared with everyone else in the gym, and, from our experience, are only cleaned every few months when routes are changed. Anecdotally, we observe that very few climbers wash their hands during sessions, and not all climbers wash their hands after sessions. Sharing holds in this way seems an opportunity for the transmission of bacteria and viruses transited by airborne, fecal-oral and droplet routes via contaminated fomites and high population densities.",

Although analysis of viral flora is lacking, amplified bacterial SSU rRNA sequencing of climbing hold surfaces reveal that 5% of sequences were likely derived from the oral microbiome and 9% from the genus Escherichia which is mainly found in the enteric tract3. It is not clear what the pathogenic potential of these microbes are, however, case series have attributed community acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection to sharing of bench pressing equipment and floors in volleyball4. Transmission of viral infections such as herpes simplex virus occurs in contact sports, however, there is not yet evidence of viral transmission by shared sports equipment4.",

While public places are open, containment measures to minimize transmission risk are sensible. Bacteria and enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and are also susceptible to inactivation by high percentage ethanol containing hand gels9\n,\n10. Concerted efforts to provide ethanol based hand gels, posters reminding people to wash hands regularly and short verbal interventions reminding people to wash hands have been effective in reducing nosocomial infections, these changes could have similar benefits in climbing gyms9.",
