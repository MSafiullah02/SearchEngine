Because ssDNA is the preferred substrate\nof A3 proteins, we decided to evaluate the inhibitory effect of chemically\nmodified ssDNAs in which the target 2\u2032-deoxycytidine in the\nrecognition sequence32,36 is substituted with TSAs. We\nfocused on 2\u2032-deoxyzebularine (dZ), as it is a known, stable,\nmoderately potent TSA inhibitor of CDA with an apparent Ki of 2.9 \u03bcM37 and its\nincorporation into DNA by automated synthesis is feasible.38 The quantity of modified oligos needed for the\nplanned experiments warranted development of a new synthesis procedure\nfor dZ.

Binding data were recorded using\na combination of fluorescence polarization (FP), ITC, and thermal\nshift assays. We confirmed that 9\u201310 nucleotides is a good\ncompromise between the length of the oligo and binding affinity and\nconcluded that binding of TSA-containing oligos must be investigated\nwith catalytically active proteins. Finally, our activity data show\nclearly the inhibition of selected A3 variants by dZ-containing oligos.\nThe list of proteins used can be found in Figure S3, and the sequences of oligos in Tables 1 and 2. One should\nnote that the preferred A3G substrate motif is CCCA (underlined C preferentially deaminated), whereas A3A and A3B prefer\nthe TCA motif but can also readily deaminate the CCCA motif. The rationale\nfor the design of each oligo can be found in Table S3.",

This indicates that the glutamate in the active\nsite is strongly involved in interaction with the transition state\nof deamination. These data are consistent with a model in which the\nGlu modifies the TSA by protonation of N3 of the nucleobase causing\nthe addition of a water molecule to the C4 of dZ, as established for\nCDA.54 In addition, our data clearly show\nan influence of buffer on dissociation constants, with a high ionic\nstrength (800 mM) depressing the affinity by more than 2 orders of\nmagnitude relative to that with a medium ionic strength (\u223c100\nmM). Our observation that dZMe in the structure of ssDNA\ndid not provide significant inhibition of A3GCTD is consistent\nwith earlier observations that 5-Me-cytidine was not deaminated by\nA3GCTD.51\u221253 On the other hand, dZ instead of dC in ssDNA produced\ncompetitive, micromolar inhibitors of A3GCTD, A3BCTD-QM-\u0394L-AL1swap, and A3BCTD-DM. The fact that dZ\nand dZMe used in the same oligo sequence had different\ninhibitory effects on A3GCTD under identical conditions\nmeans that structure of the TSA determines the inhibitory potential\nof the TSA-containing oligo. Moreover, adjacent nucleotides proximal\nto the TSA define the selectivity for binding and concomitant inhibition\nof a particular A3 family member as in the case of selective inhibition\nof A3GCTD by Oligo-7 and not by Oligo-9 (Figure 3A). These sequence-dependent\nmolecular recognition properties provide opportunities for the design\nof specific inhibitors of A3 family members.",

An approximately 10\u201330-fold decrease\nin the apparent inhibition constants (Ki) of dZ oligos over Km of the corresponding\ndC-containing substrates was observed in our study. In comparison,\nzebularine as an individual nucleoside shows a 100-fold lower Ki in comparison to the Km of cytidine for CDA.54 This indicates\nthat the preferences for TSA vary between A3 and CDAs. In addition,\nthe strength of binding of the dZ-ssDNA to the A3 enzyme may be mediated\nby the interactions of surrounding nucleotides with amino acids close\nto the active site. The latter possibility is supported by the fact\nthat introduction of modified nucleotides at positions \u22122 to\n+1 substantially affected the rate of deamination (target dC has number\n0, nucleotides in the 5\u2032-direction have a minus sign, and nucleotides\nin the 3\u2032-direction have a plus sign).56 Recent work has revealed that ssDNA adopts a U-shape for the target\ndC to enter the active site of the protein,29,30,42 such that nucleotides at positions \u22122,\n\u22121, and +1 have strong interactions with the proteins, as well.\nOur previously published NMR-based method of small changes shows additional\ntransient interactions with nucleotides farther from the active site.29 This\nalso correlates with our observations that short DNA sequences (5-mers)\nbind much more weakly than longer ssDNAs (>9-mers) to A3A-E72A\n(Tables 1 and 2) and with the results of other groups.39,40,47",
