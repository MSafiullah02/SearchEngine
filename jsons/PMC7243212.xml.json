The findings challenge the dogma that the availability of fast food drives weight gain, and the corollary\u2014that availability of exercise venues reduces the risk of future obesity. There are many strengths in this study, even though observational data can never prove causality. This includes its longitudinal design, long duration (11 years) of follow-up, the use of national registers to source individual-level data and availability of environmental information according to discrete geographic locations. In the absence of any hint of association, the authors conclude that the availability of fast food outlets and lack of physical activity facilities are unlikely to cause obesity in Swedish adults. In other words, we need to look elsewhere. It is yet another excellent example of contrary or null findings in relation to the naughty calories = positive energy balance theory.",

Indeed, in USA and other developed countries, the sharp rise in obesity over the past 3 decades has occurred in parallel across all socioeconomic groupings [2]. We need to ask what environmental changes are common to all societal levels.",

Mathematical modelling shows that a tiny, virtually imperceptible energy imbalance underwrites the incremental weight gain creep that produces obesity in adulthood, equivalent to just 30 kJ/day (7.5 calories/day) over and above weight maintenance [8]. Over 10 years, the difference between weight gain and no weight gain is just 0.2% of total energy intake [9]. It is highly unlikely that any of us can do this fine degree of juggling at a conscious level whether we eat healthy food or not-so-healthy food.",

A greater understanding of blood circulating factors and environmental indicators of lean individuals is likely to shed light to this field [12]. The continuing focus on the dogma of energy balance and solutions based on \u2018eating right\u2019, more fruit and vegetables or plant food, or less processed food, sugar, fat or salt, as an antidote to obesity is now 50 years old.
