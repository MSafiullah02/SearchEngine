In this regard, we read with interest the paper by Iago Rodr\u00edguez-Lago and colleagues on the outcome of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the Basque Country, Spain [1] . Interestingly, patients with IBD and Covid-19 had a good overall prognosis, despite around one third of them were under immunomodulator therapy, and 18% were on biologics.",

            "text": "The interplay between Covid-19 and the medications used for IBD is currently undefined. However, it is well known that several drugs used in IBD patients may promote the occurrence of infections -including the opportunistic and viral ones. Nonetheless, the specific impact of immunosuppression on the severity of Covid-19 remains unclear. Data reported on 1099 patients from China did not observe immunomodulator use as a risk factor for severe disease [2] . Furthermore, the level of immunosuppression -and thus the theoretical risk of developing severe forms of Covid-19 -varies depending by the specific drug. In this regard, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines distinguish patients with low-level vs. high level immunosuppression [3] , and only patients receiving daily corticosteroid therapy with a dose > 20 mg of prednisone or equivalent for >14 days, and those receiving tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors should be considered as individuals with high-level immunosuppression. We believe that this simple classification is reliable also in patients with IBD. Other drugs are not specifically mentioned by IDSA guidelines, as they have been developed after the formulation of these indications. Anyway, the gut-specificity of Vedolizumab should make the possibility that the drug may increase the risk of Covid-19 complications quite unlikely, while the anti-IL-12/23p40 block induced by Ustekinumab has been associated with an excellent safety profile [4] . Regarding Tofacitinib (and JAK inhibitors in general), some concerns may arise due to its potent multi-cytokine suppressive interference, even if its safety profile in IBD still 3 needs to be clearly defined [5] . Recently, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) published a document of advice for management of IBD during the Covid-19 pandemic [6] .",

In summary, patients under treatment with any drug used for IBDwith the exception of mesalamine, budesonide, beclometasone or rectal therapies -were considered to have at least a moderate risk, while they were in the highest risk group if they had also a co-morbidity and/or were \u226570 years old. Even if authors stressed the concept that patients should continue their current medications until different medical advice, we believe that the use of terms such as \"moderate\" or \"highest\" risk may induce an unjustified alarmism among doctors and patients which could lead to erroneously take into account the opportunity to reduce or suspend the treatments for IBD, with the potential risk for flares of the disease.",

In this line, Adalimumab has been proposed as a biologic to test in the management of COVID-19 [8] . In addition, preliminary evidence supported the use of Tocilizumab -an IL-6 receptor antagonists -in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-driven pneumonia, and similar effects could be induced by other anti-ILs drugs, such as Ustekinumab. Similar considerations may be argued also for JAK inhibitors, as their multicytokines block could be beneficial in preventing the \"cytokine storm\" syndrome. Not by 4 chance, Ruxolitinib -a JAK1/2 selective inhibitor used for the treatment of primary myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and graft-versus-host disease [22] -has very recently started to be tested for Covid-19 [8] .",
