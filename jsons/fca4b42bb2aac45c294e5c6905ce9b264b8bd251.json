The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is an important structural and functional protein. To identify cellular proteins that interact with the SARS-CoV N protein and to elucidate the possible involvement of N protein in SARS-CoV pathogenesis, a human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened using a yeast two-hybrid system assay. hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of sumoylation system, was found to interact specifically with the N protein, implying the posttranslational sumoylation of the N protein. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acids 170-210, which includes the SR-rich motif. However, the consensus motif of sumoylation GK 62 EE in the N protein is not responsible for binding to hUbc9. Mutations of hUbc9 at the enzyme active site C93A or C93S severely impair the interaction with the N protein. The two proteins were also shown to colocalize in the cytoplasm of the transfected 293T cells. This is the first report demonstrating the interaction of hUbc9 with a structural protein of plus-strand RNA viruses, indicating a new drug target for SARS-CoV.",

A lysine-rich region in the C-terminal domain was predicted as the nuclear localization signal (NLS), and an SR-rich motif was identified in the middle domain that may be related to RNA binding and protein-protein interaction (Fig. 1) . The N protein has been shown to form a multimer both in vivo and in vitro, and its C-terminal domain is responsible for this oligomerization [Surjit et al., 2004b; Yu et al., 2005] . The formation of N protein dimers is likely to be the first step in the formation of the nucleocapsid core and further oligomerization is likely to continue to drive assembly of the core. The N protein can also interact with the membrane protein of SARS-CoV, and this appears to be an essential process for viral assembly [He et al., 2004b] .

Such cellular proteins could function through an interaction with the N protein. It has been reported that the SARS-CoV N protein interacts with several cellular proteins, including cyclophylin A and human cellular heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) [Luo et al., 2004 [Luo et al., , 2005 . A yeast two-hybrid screen system was used to search for cellular proteins that may interact with SARS-CoV N protein. In this study, it is demonstrated that the SARS-CoV N protein specifically interacts with human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2 (hUbc9), an important enzyme of sumoylation system. This result is consistent with a recent study that showed SARS-CoV N was sumoylated as hUbc9 is involved in the process of protein sumoylation. It is also shown that the binding site of the N protein is largely localized in the SR-rich motif, and that the enzymatic active site C93 of hUbc9 is responsible for the interaction with the N protein.",

Nucleocapsid protein of some viruses can be sumoylated at this consensus acceptor lysine Maeda et al., 2003] . Analysis of the SARS-CoV N protein sequence showed that it contains 27 lysine residues. Only one lysine residue at amino acid position 62, K62, lies roughly within the consensus SUMO-1 modification sequence (GK 62 EE) . To determine whether this lysine was responsible for the interaction with hUbc9, it was mutated to an Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. As shown in Figure 6A , this mutation does not affect the binding of the N protein and hUbc9. The full-length N protein was divided into three domains to study the binding domain of the N protein: the N-terminal domain N1-169, the middle domain N170-295 containing the SR-rich motif and the C-terminal domain N296-422 (Fig. 1) . These three truncated proteins were tested for hUbc9 binding using the two-hybrid assay in yeast (Fig. 6B) . The results indicated that N170-295, the middle domain of the N protein, is responsible for the interaction. To determine further the region of the N protein involved in hUbc9 binding, the middle domain was divided into two parts, N170-220 and N210-295, the former containing the SR-rich motif. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, the bgalactosidase activity of N170-220 fragment is much higher than the activity of N210-295 fragment. These Fig. 5 .

            "text": "hUbc9 is an extraordinarily conserved protein in evolution from yeast to human. It is an important enzyme in the sumoylation pathway. hUbc9 catalyzes the modification of target proteins by covalent addition of a small ubiquitin-like modifier known as SUMO-1. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification process of proteins involving the formation of an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of SUMO-1 and a lysine side chain of the target protein. The SUMO-1 pathway involves ATP-dependent SUMO-1 activation catalyzed by the heterodimeric SUMO-1 activating enzyme (SAE1/SAE2). This is followed by transfer of SUMO-1 to the SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme hUbc9 in a transesterification reaction and the final transfer of SUMO-1 from the SUMO-1-Ubc9 complex to the target protein. Unlike ubiquitination, sumoylation does not cause protein degradation, but has been implicated in other cellular processes such as regulating the activity of transcription factors, mediating protein-protein interaction, enhancing protein stability and nuclear and cytoplasm trafficking [Muller et al., 2001; Seeler and Dejean, 2003] . Many viral proteins can interact with hUbc9 and sumoylated, which is important for virus replication [Rangasamy and Wilson, 2000; Lee et al., 2003; Maeda et al., 2003; Weldon et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2004; Gurer et al., 2005] . So far it seems that most of the viral proteins binding to hUbc9 are capsid proteins involved in virus genome binding and replication.",

The specificity of this interaction was initially observed in the yeast twohybrid system and was substantiated by further experiments. Firstly, it was shown that purified GST-hUbc9 fusion proteins specifically bound the N protein obtained from either in vitro translation reactions or cell lysates infected by SARS-CoV. Secondly, FLAG-hUbc9 could be immunoprecipitated with an N-myc fusion protein using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. Finally and importantly, coexpression of pEGFP-N and pDsRed-Ubc9 in 293T cells revealed a reproducible colocalization both in the cytoplasm. These results strongly suggest that hUbc9 and the SARS-CoV N protein interact in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. This is another example of viral capsid protein bound to hUbc9 but the exact role of this kind of interaction in virus replication needs to be further explored.",

In order to determine whether the sumoylation site K62 is responsible for the binding to hUbc9, some site-mutagenesis work was undertaken and the result suggests that the consensus motif of sumoylation does not correspond with the binding site of the N protein to hUbc9. The yeast two-hybrid assays of the truncated N mutants with hUbc9 indicated that the binding site of the N protein to hUbc9 is focused instead on the SR-rich motif. SR-related proteins are often involved in protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions [Blencowe et al., 1999; Hertel and Graveley, 2005] , and the SR-rich motif is conserved in the N protein of coronavirus. It has been reported recently that SR-rich motif is indispensable for SARS-CoV N oligomerization [He et al., 2004a] and for N protein interaction with SARS-CoV membrane protein [He et al., 2004b] . The SR-rich motif is also responsible for the interaction with hnRNPA1 [Luo et al., 2004] . All of these facts indicate that the SR-rich motif of the N protein has a crucial role in SARS-CoV infection.",

Identification of the binding site of hUbc9 to the N protein determined by GST-pull down assays. Purified GST and GST-fusion proteins, such as GST-hUbc9, GST-C93A, and GST-C93S bound to the glutathione-sepharose 4B were incubated with the 293T cell lysates transfected with N-myc for 8 hr at 48C. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-myc monoclonal antibodies. This clearly indicated that the mutation C93A abolished the binding, with only weak binding for the C93S mutant. expression of dominant negative hUbc9 can suppress the expression of Bcl-2 and enhance apoptosis [Mo et al., 2005] . Some reports show that SARS-CoV N protein is associated with signaling pathways such as the AP-1 or Akt pathway to influence the cell cycle [He et al., 2003; Surjit et al., 2004a] . In COS-1 cells, SARS-CoV N protein expression down-regulated Bcl-2 levels and induced apoptosis in the absence of growth factors [Surjit et al., 2004a] . Therefore, it is possible that the interaction of the SARS-CoV N protein and hUbc9 may directly regulate the activity of hUbc9, affecting downstream signaling factors involved in the cell cycle, in addition to its function in the process of sumoylation, which might be important for protein trafficking, and nucleocapsid core assembly. However, the function of the interaction between the SARS-CoV N protein and hUbc9 in the virus life cycle and the host cell cycle remains to be clarified fully.",
