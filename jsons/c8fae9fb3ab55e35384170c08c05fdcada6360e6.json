Phylogenetic analysis of the 19 proteins indicated that the IiDIR genes cluster into three distinct subfamilies, DIR-a, DIR-b/d, and DIR-e, of a larger plant DIR and DIR-like gene family. Gene-specific primers were designed for 19 unique IiDIRs and were used to evaluate patterns of constitutive expression in different organs. It showed that most IiDIR genes were expressed comparatively higher in roots and flowers than stems and leaves.",

The root of I. indigotica is the well-known Chinese medicine \"Banlangen\" (Radix Isatidis), which is widely used for flu and infections of the upper respiratory tract in China. During the epidemic period of severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) in 2003, Banlangen demonstrated the potential prevention of SARS [2] .

The precursor of lariciresinol is pinoresinol, which comes from E-coniferyl alcohol by the action of dirigent proteins (DIR) [10] . Dirigent (Latin: dirigere, to guide or align) proteins are members of a large family which imparts stereoselectivity on the phenoxy radical-coupling reaction. These proteins can capture E-coniferyl alcohol (only E-coniferyl alcohol, not p-coumaryl or sinapyl alcohols which differ only in the degree of aromatic methoxylation [10] ) derived freeradical intermediates and orientate these radicals in such a way as to enable 8-8' coupling with concomitant intramolecular cyclization to afford optically active (+)or (\u2212)-pinoresinol [11] [12] [13] [14] . In the absence of DIR proteins, only non-specific radical-radical coupling occurs at the 8-8' , 8-5' , or 8-O-4 ' positions with the resulting formation of racemic lignan products [12] [13] [14] .",

Ralph and coworkers [16] suggest that the DIR proteins are subdivided into five groups: the DIR-a, DIR-b, DIR-c, DIR-d and DIR-e subfamilies. With the increasing numbers of DIR proteins, the DIR-b and DIR-d subfamilies are combined together with the appearance of the DIR-f and DIR-g subfamilies [17] . However, only members of DIR-a subfamily are being studied for their biochemical functions; the other proteins are referred to as DIR-like proteins. The DIR and DIR-like protein gene family in I. indigotica has not been analyzed in detail yet. Under the umbrella of a transcription profiling of I. indigotica [18] , 19 full-length IiDIRs (the dirigent or dirigent-like protein genes of I. indigotica) are mined analytically through bioinformatics. Here we report an inventory and sequence analysis as well as the phylogenetic relationships of the IiDIR gene family. A detailed quantitative real-time PCR expression analysis in constitutive I. indigotica tissues is described for 19 IiDIRs. Finally, we provide a transcriptome analysis of IiDIRs, which is based on data treated with MeJA at different time points.",

The topology analyses of the IiDIRs showed that they contribute to DIR-a, DIR-b/d, and DIR-e subfamilies. Recent studies only focused on the function of the DIR-a subfamily, classifying the other DIRs from the other subfamilies to be the DIR-like proteins. According to Pickel [11, 27] , AtDIR5 and AtDIR6 from DIR-a subfamily of A. thaliana were different from those DIRs found earlier, such as FiDIR1 and TpDIR7 [28] . The first DIR from Forsythia suspensa was found to guide E-coniferyl alcohol to form (+)-pinoresinol [12] , and many other DIRs had the same function [29] . However, in the presence of AtDIR6, the final product of E-coniferyl alcohol was the enantiomer (\u2212)-pinoresinol. From the topology tree of DIRs from different species (Figure 3 ), IiDIR2/3/4 were adjacent to AtDIR6, and IiDIR1 was next to AtDIR5. These observations suggested that IiDIR1/2/3/4 might have similar functions with AtDIR6 and AtDIR5. Sequence comparisons between AtDIR6 and IiDIR2/3/4 as well as AtDIR5, IiDIR1, FiDIR1 and TpDIR7 were performed by clustalX 2.1 [30] . The results showed that IiDIR2 had 93.05% identity with AtDIR6, while IiDIR3 and IiDIR4 had only 68.45% and 66.31% identity with AtDIR6. It suggested that the relative among IiDIR3, IiDIR4 and AtDIR6 might far away from that between IiDIR2 and AtDIR6. IiDIR1 had 90.66% identity with AtDIR5. Residues conservation was shown in Figure 4 .",
