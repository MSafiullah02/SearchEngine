            "text": "Spinal epidural empyema (SEE) is an accumulation of purulent material in the epidural space of the vertebral canal that causes spinal cord dysfunction due to mechanical compression and inflammation. In human SEE, most infections are bacterial with a minority of abscesses caused by mycobacteria, fungi or parasites (Reihsaus et al. 2000). Human SEE is a rare medical emergency and accounts for 0\u22192 to 2/10,000 hospital admissions (Grieve et al. 2000). It is even more rarely reported in animals, the majority have been in dogs (Remedios et al. 1996, Dewey et al. 1998, Jerram & Dewey 1998, Cherrone et al. 2002, Nykamp et al. 2003, Lavely et al. 2006, Cross et al. 2008, Sutton et al. 2010, Monteiro et al. 2016) and it has also been reported in two cats (Granger et al. 2007, Maeta et al. 2010). Clinical signs in dogs and cats are comparable to those in humans, varying from fever, spinal hyperaesthesia to spinal cord dysfunction (Hanigan et al. 1990, Rigamonti et al. 1999, Grieve et al. 2000, Reihsaus et al. 2000, Curry Jr et al. 2005, Duarte & Vaccaro 2013). Routes of infection include haematogenous spread, contiguous infections from adjacent tissues, direct inoculation and migration of foreign bodies or aberrant parasites (Reihsaus et al. 2000, Curry Jr et al. 2005, Barrs et al. 2007, Monteiro et al. 2016). Rapid progression of clinical signs is possible and delayed diagnosis and treatment may result in permanent neurological dysfunction and higher mortality. In humans surgical decompression combined with antimicrobial therapy has been the treatment of choice although there have been reports of successful treatment with antibiotics alone in selected patients (Rigamonti et al. 1999, Grieve et al. 2000, Soehle & Wallenfang 2002, Curry Jr et al. 2005, Duarte & Vaccaro 2013). Here we describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatments and outcomes of four cats with SEE diagnosed in a private clinic from 2010 to 2016. The clinic received about 17,000 feline cases during this period, of which around 550 were neurological. The prevalence of spinal epidural empyema was therefore 0\u221902% of all feline patients and 0\u22197% of the neurologically affected cats.",
