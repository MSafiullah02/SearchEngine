The COVID-19 pandemic impacts the number of infected, its related mortality, as well as the care of cancer patients. Multiple myeloma patients are a particular group with several important aspects to be considered during pandemic times. In essence, they are immunosuppressed in different intensities during their treatment. Most of them are elderly and all of them require long-term therapy, with prolonged contact with the health care system, possibly including a stem cell transplant during the treatment. A panel of experts in multiple myeloma and infectious diseases discusses pieces of evidence and the lack of the same in the scenario of COVID-19 in myeloma patients, while also exposing what is expected for the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Dysfunction in humoral response against virus and bacterial agents, concerning immune senescence, can be noted in newly diagnosed patients and during all treatment phases of the disease. (3) Anti-myeloma therapies, mostly resulting from a combination of different classes of agents, also contribute to intensifying the immune damage. Corticosteroid, a backbone agent in several protocols, proteasome inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies decrease T-cell response. Immunomodulatory agents impact the immune response and, in some settings, can also induce myelotoxicity and neutropenia. In addition, myeloma patients are frequently elderly, or present comorbidities. All these characteristics negatively impact infection events, not only increasing the risk of infection acquisition, but also worsening the outcomes. Cohort data from 9,000 Swedish patients demonstrated that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f myeloma was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of viral infections, and mortality related to infection increases from 2% to 12%, compared to healthy controls. (4) Vaccine response is another important issue in myeloma patients. Low rates of seroconversion have already been documented in Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. (5) Although international oncohematological societies are considering multiple myeloma alone a risk factor for COVID-19, few data were published addressing incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in myeloma patients. There are some data from the International Myeloma Foundation, (6) ",

It is a betacoronavirus, closely resembling the SARS-CoV, the coronavirus related to SARS, in the years of 2002 and 2003. The SARS-CoV 2 has a very efficient mechanism of entry in host cells by angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptors, and it has RNAdependent RNA polymerase and proteases. In the majority of cases, it causes asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic respiratory diseases. These characteristics have been essential to the great and fast spread of the virus, as it spreads person to person J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f through respiratory droplets. After a median incubation period of 4 to 5 days, symptomatic patients can experience one or more symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia and ageusia. (7, 8) Patients can develop worsening of the respiratory disease, with shortness of breath, hypoxemia, or other signs of multiorgan involvement. The COVID-19 has been described as a disease with two different phases. (9) The first phase presents symptoms and signs related to viral infection and the late phase is related to severe inflammatory disease with a high rate of necessity for intensive supportive care, such as mechanical ventilation, with a high mortality rate. (10) Fortunately, most of the cases do not experience the inflammatory phase, but special groups of patients, so-called high-risk groups, have shown worse outcomes. The elderly individuals suffering from comorbidities and obesity and other subgroups have been described as having a worse prognosis. (11) Patients under specific drugs, such as corticoids, are also considered at high risk for COVID-19 complications. (12) Few studies have reported the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in cancer patients suggesting a worse prognosis, but they have had a limited design regarding control groups.",

Other drugs, such as heparin and defibrotide have been tested, targeting prothrombotic status and endotheliitis (16, 17) . Regarding a vaccine, research is ongoing, and no preliminary data have been published to date. (18) Few reliable measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic are available, but one is categorical. Social distancing is necessary to reduce the spread of transmission and to prevent a health care system collapse. (19) There is another significant issue in regard to the health care staff. High rates of infection have been reported all over the world, including in-hospital transmission and dissemination. This has been causing a reduction in the staff taking care of patients, as if the ASCT is considered a priority. The virologic cure is also mandatory before ASCT in these cases. For ultra-high-risk cases, some authors suggest that a minimum of 14 days can be a safety period to reduce Covid-19 complications risks. It is important to note that all these recommendations were based on viral kinetic data and they have not been validated by clinical studies. Patients with respiratory symptoms without COVID-19 lab J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f confirmation and those who report contact with COVID-19 patients should be asymptomatic and wait at least 14 days to start ASCT procedures.

The PCR for SARS-Cov2 is regarded as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the best procedure to detect acute diseases, but the sensitivity depends on the specimen, time from the onset of the symptoms and technical issues. Rapid antigen detection does not perform well and serological tests are restricted to the confirmation of the infection, retrospectively.(14) Until now, there are no antiviral or anti-inflammatory agents that demonstrate a clear benefit in the treatment of COVID-19. There are many ongoing trials, including agents with different targets, namely the blocking of the SARS-CoV 2 from the entry host cell (arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxichloroquine), the production of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and virus replication (lopinavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir), as well as the targeting of the immunological response, such as anti-IL 1 and anti-IL 6 (anakinra, tocilizumab).(15).In very recent days, preliminary results from a randomized controlled trial demonstrated that COVID-19 patients who received remdesivir had a shorter hospital stay, compared to placebo controls. On May 1, the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration Agency) authorized the prescription of this drug in severe cases of COVID-19 in the US.",

            "text": "the loss of health care staff lives. Health care workers must be protected from SARS-CoV 2 when they are providing clinical care.(20) Considerations about the Health Care System: How can the hematological service be prepared nowadays?Important issues regarding the health care system should be addressed. The system has to be adjusted to receive an increasing number of patients in emergency rooms, someneeding intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Measures to control the risk of inhospital dissemination should be implemented, such as the reduction of patient visitation by medical and nursing staff, increased personal protective equipment (PPE) supply and implementation of part-time home office, when applicable. (21) At the same level of importance, the maintenance of the quality of care provided to cancer patients must be the goal. Cancer centers have a very challenging situation in keeping going. Delaying new diagnoses or postponing urgent therapies can negatively impact the prognosis. For multiple myeloma patients, postponing diagnosis or induction therapy can increase the burden of disease, affect the staging category and enable renal involvement and bone destruction. As a result, the patient outcome can be compromised. Therefore, health care institutions should maintain their full activity. Hematologists should participate in the elaboration of infection control protocols aimed at adequate areas and patient flow. All the staff should be trained to follow these protocols. Surmising that the crossing of health care professionals from one area to another constitutes an important vector for virus dissemination, distinct staff should be designated to attend to COVID-19 and \"COVID-19 free\" sectors. Patients and staff J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f should always be screened before entering the facility or the hospital for the symptoms of, and exposition to, SARS-CoV 2. Symptomatic patients or staff must not be admitted to a \"COVID-19 free area\", even for testing. Patients should undergo SARS-CoV 2 testing (PCR) before starting myeloma treatment. Health care professionals should undergo serological testing to better organize patient care. Information about COVID-19 and how patients and families can protect themselves should be provided systematically. Medical and nursing visits, routine laboratory testing, catheter maintenance and other regular visits should be scheduled as infrequently as possible. Implementation of telemedicine is also a good way to safely reduce patient exposure to the hospital environment. Regarding therapy, options and strategies are separately discussed for each phase of myeloma treatment. Regarding the PPE, the most recent recommendation supports the universal use of droplet-contact precautions throughout the whole patient clinical assistance, as SARS-CoV 2 can be transmitted before the onset of symptoms by asymptomatic carriers. (22, 23) Newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma and first-line treatment During the COVID-19 pandemic, new diagnoses of multiple myeloma continue to be made. Risk stratification is important, as well as the decision on how urgent or not the need for treatment is. Patients with more aggressive diseases, with significant anemia, renal dysfunction, hypercalcemia and plasma cell leukemia, or high-risk cytogenetic patients, need to start treatment as soon as possible. Some experts recommend COVID-19 screening for all, and we suggest performing PCR and serological tests, if available. A J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f positive PCR or a positive IgM or IgA for SARS-CoV 2 should be considered as \"active COVID-19\" and myeloma treatment may be postponed for 2 or more weeks, depending on the clinical decision. On the other hand, if an IgG positive serology test is documented, myeloma treatment can be initiated as usual. Several points should be addressed regarding the treatment regimen selection: oral versus parenteral drugs, corticosteroids dosing, schedule of medical visits and labs and the risk of adverse events. For frail patients (elderly and/or with comorbidities), induction treatment with regimens including only oral drugs is an interesting option, if feasible. These regimes require fewer visits to the cancer unit, reducing patient exposure and the risk of SARS-CoV 2 infection. (24,25) In our view, fit patients can be treated with approved standard therapy strategies. We do not favor any specific regimen in detriment of others, because of a lack of available data regarding COVID-19 and myeloma, or COVID-19 in the particular setting of chemotherapy or immunomodulatory drugs. In the case of the occurrence of adverse events, dosing reductions and/or interval prolongations between cycles should be considered. Our panel suggests reducing the weekly dose of dexamethasone to 20mg to decrease the risk of infectious complications. Stem cell transplant Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) improves the outcomes of myeloma patients, but on the other hand, this intense treatment requires adequate hospital facilities and experienced staff to ensure the best results. Although the necessity for intensive care occurs in a minority of cases, unpredictable events can take place. Furthermore, it is mandatory to ensure an adequate supply of blood components during the pre-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f engraftment phase. These issues can specially be modified during pandemic times. The decision to postpone stem cell transplants should be individualized, considering the patients and the characteristics of the Unit during the pandemic. The ASCT can be safely postponed for patients with controlled disease (very good partial response, at least).Extending the induction therapy for up to 6 cycles is recommended for all patients before ASCT during the pandemic. Patients who achieved a complete response and a negative minimal residual disease can extend initial therapy for up to 8 or 9 cycles and start maintenance thereafter, reserving ASCT for the first relapse.(26,27) On the other hand, uncontrolled disease, or ultra-high-risk patients, such as those with plasma cell leukemia, the ASCT can be a salvage therapy. In these situations, the ASCT may beperformed if the patient, staff and center coordination take the necessary safety precautions. All patients should be screened for the SARS-CoV 2 before stem cell harvest and conditioning. If the screening is positive (a positive SARS-Cov-2 PCR or a positive IgA or IgM), the ASCT must be postponed for at least 3 weeks and stem cell harvesting and transplant conditioning should be performed only after a documented virologic cure (two negative SARS-CoV 2 PCRs). (28) For ASCT candidates who experienced the COVID-19 (symptoms of the disease and Lab confirmation), transplant should be delayed for 3 months, or for a minimum of 21 days",

            "text": "For those with an indication for subsequent-line treatment, daratumumab-based regimens can be optimized to reduce infusion time to 90 minutes after the third dose, if the patient has had no prior infusion-related reaction. (23) For carfilzomib-based regimens, we recommend considering a one-day-per-week infusion (instead of two days per week) as an alternative to reduce patient exposure to health care units, depending on the combination regimen and dosing. (29) Supportive measures J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f We do not recommend modifications in supportive care during different phases of myeloma treatment, except for the use of bisphosphonates. For patients with no signs of active bone disease and no hypercalcemia, bisphosphonates can be deferred. For other cases, we recommend using zoledronate every 3 months, considering the interruption if the patient achieved complete response and has had at least 2 years of bisphosphonates. The indication of the antithrombotic agents acyclovir and sulfa as prophylaxis remains the same as before the COVID-19 pandemic and should be amenable to the treatment-phase and combination drugs in use. Any additional antimicrobial prophylaxis, considering the COVID-19 pandemic, is not recommended at the present time. Vaccination, especially against Influenza and pneumococcal species is crucial, as well as vaccination of family and contacts. The universal use of masks and intense hand hygiene are mandatory.",
