Previous studies have revealed the radiological features at different stages of the disease [2\u20134], but the radiological manifestations during the convalescence period are still unclear. Wu et al. reported that residual pulmonary lesions such as GGO and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening could be persistently observed years after recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5]. It has remained a concern to medical professionals and the public whether similar severe sequalae also exist for COVID-19.

For SARS, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening was observed to predominate over GGO even at 84 months [5]. In our cohort, GGO and fibrous stripe were the main imaging findings during the convalescence of COVID-19 pneumonia, which could be gradually absorbed completely, while a crazy-paving pattern was not demonstrated [3]. This observation addressed the question raised by Shi H et al. about whether the fibrosis in COVID-19 is irreversible [2]. There were three patterns in the residual lesions with proper evolution after discharge: 1. the extent of GGO was reduced and gradually faded until it completely disappeared; 2. fibrous stripes developed within the GGO area (mixed pattern), followed by gradual resorption and disappearance; and 3. fibrous stripes gradually reduced with decreasing density (Fig. 4). \u201cTinted\u201d sign and bronchovascular bundle distortion as two special features were discovered during the evolution. The \u201ctinted\u201d sign was demonstrated as extension of the GGO area and a decrease in density, which might follow the \u201cmelting sugar\u201d sign [16]. In this study, 51 patients were found with a \u201ctinted\u201d sign. The appearance of this pattern probably implies the gradual resolution of inflammation with re-expansion of alveoli and hence the resolution or recovery of illness, for which the pathological evidence merits further investigation. In the mixed pattern, 10 patients were found to have bronchovascular bundle distortion, with 4 patients with complete resolution during 17\u201337 days after discharge. This may be caused by inflammatory distraction or subsegmental atelectasis. In addition, 14 patients had varying extents of residual fibrous stripes, and the lesions were not fully resorbed at the end of the observation, which may be attributed to the limited follow-up time. The other CT manifestations in convalescence, such as thickening of the adjacent pleura and small pleural effusion, could also be absorbed completely.\n",
