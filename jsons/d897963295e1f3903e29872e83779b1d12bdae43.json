The focus is providing relief from the symptoms and the stress of the illness. The goal is to improve quality of life for both child and the family. The specially trained team which consists of a doctor, nurse, counsellor and sometimes, depending on resources, physiotherapist, play/music therapist, religious person, work together with other doctors of the child as an extra layer of support. Palliative care is appropriate at any age and at any stage of illness and it can be provided along with curative treatment or as standalone.",

The palliative care team provides additional support during emergencies and health crises, while also helping to address the challenges of daily living. Therefore, an integrated palliative care program ideally consists of out-patient, in-patient, hospice and home care to maintain continuum of services. However, there are many successful PPC models across the world which have a different combination of these services.",

In India, these authors estimate that there are 1.6 million children in need of specialized pediatric palliative care [3] . Presently, there are very few trained PPC specialist doctors in India, which is both due to the lack of awareness about the existence of such a specialty, and limited provisions for training in this specialty. As some centers are now providing training in this speciality, we feel that more young pediatricians need to take-up this specialty by utilizing available training facilities, so that the quality of life of children with lifethreatening conditions can be improved.",

He did not have any pre-existing medical illness, history of contact with soil, or groundwater. He presented in July, which is monsoon season in coastal Karnataka. On examination, his weight was 30 kg (75th percentile), height was 130 cm (50th to 75th centile), and vitals were stable. Oral examination revealed red and swollen tonsils with an exudative membrane on the medial surface. He had multiple erythematous, tender, nodular lesions of 10-20 mm size on bilateral lower limbs consistent with erythema nodosum. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Baseline blood tests showed hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, total leukocyte count of 11.8\u00d710 9 /L (P 80%, L 16%), platelet count of 241\u00d710 9 /L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 42 mm/h and C-reactive protein of 96 mg/dL. Throat swab and blood culture were sent, and he was prescribed intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and amikacin. His throat swab isolated Burkholderia pesudomallei, hence antibiotics were changed to intravenous ceftazidime (120 mg/kg/day). The child improved with resolution of symptoms over the next four days. He received ceftazidime for 10 days and was discharged on oral trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole (6mg/kg of trimethoprim) for three months. The child is well at six month follow-up.",
