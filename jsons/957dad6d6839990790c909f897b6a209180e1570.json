Immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M anticardiolipin antibodies were also tested with a negative result. D-dimer levels were elevated up to 2460 ug/L and therefore, due to high suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism, dual-energy pulmonary computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTPA) was performed. CTPA confirmed bilateral thromboembolism associated with multiple opacities compatible with viral pneumonia (figure 1A,B).

The baseline electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, 86 bpm, normal PR interval (131 ms) and normal QRS complex (93 ms), aQRS 0\u00ba. QTc (Friderica) 412 ms. Ecocardiography was not performed, but initial physical examination showed systemic blood pressure of 116/78 mmHg, regular rhythm, and present and symmetrical distal pulses, without signs of deep vein thrombosis.Laboratory data showed elevated ferritin levels (1127 ng/mL), CRP = 9.5 mg/dL, and increased serum IL-6 (75,60 pg/mL). Coagulation studies: prothrombin time (PT) 10.7 seconds, international normalized ratio 1.09, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 33.6 seconds. D-dimer at admission was 1320 ug/L. The patient received initial treatment with hydroxychloroquine at a loading dose of 400 mg/12 h on day 1 followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg/12 h for 4 days. She was also prescribed azithromycin 500 mg/d for 5 days, anticoagulant prophylaxis with enoxaparin (40 mg/d), methylprednisolone 70 mg/d for 5 days, and a single intravenous dose of tocilizumab (400 mg).On day 9 after admission, the patient showed oxygen desaturation and reported chest pain. Ddimer elevation up to 6120 ug/L was observed (previous 1870 ug/L) and therefore, due to high suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism, CTPA with dual-energy mode was obtained and the treatment from that day until discharge.Considering the long hospitalization of patients, pulmonary thromboembolic complications are increasing and must be considered in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia. It is also important to evaluate the possible onset of pulmonary infarcts secondary to pulmonary thromboembolism, which change the patient's management and prognosis. In this clinical scenario, the use of advanced imaging methods, such as dual energy pulmonary angiography, allows differentiation between lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19 pneumonia and ischemic or infarcted areas.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank fellow health and nonhealth workers who helped us in this study and who are struggling in this global emergency.Salvatore MARSICO, a,* Irene ESPALLARGAS GIM\u00c9NEZ, a Santiago Javier CARBULLANCA TOLEDO, a Luis Alexandre DEL CARPIO BELLIDO, a Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda MAIQUES LL\u00c1CER, a and Flavio ZUCCARINO, a,b a Departmento de Radiolog\u00eda, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain b Departamento de Radiolog\u00eda, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Esplugues de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain FIGURE LEGENDS A: computed tomography angiography maximum intensity projection oblique coronal reconstruction image showing filling defects (white arrows) in bilateral segmental and subsegmental branches of pulmonary arteries.
