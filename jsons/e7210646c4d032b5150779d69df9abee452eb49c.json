The origin of the virus is still unclear and whether pets and livestock can be infected and 34 transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host 35 receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis 36 provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from 37 species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes indicating that the 38 species barrier might be low.

This disease is referred to as the 2019 48 coronavirus disease by World Health Organization (WHO) and was defined as a public 49 health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on the 30 th of January 2020. Its main clinical 50 symptoms include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. A rather large proportion of patients become critically 51 ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome, similar to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome 52 (SARS) caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1-3). SARS emerged in China in [2002] [2003] and also 53 rapidly spread worldwide but was contained by public health measures.

Likewise, research suggests 55 that SARS-CoV-2 might have originated also from bats and that pangolins might be the potential 56 intermediate host (6) (7) (8) (9) . Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 has a high nucleotide sequence identity with Bat-CoV-57 RaTG13-like virus except for the middle part of its genome encoding the spike protein which might 58 have derived via recombination from a Pangolin-CoV-like virus (6, 7, (10) (11) (12) . A previous study showed 59 that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, but cats are permissive to infection (13). However, 60 whether pets can become new hosts of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be clarified further. 61",

The relative mRNA 264 levels in tissues relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection, lung, trachea and turbinate are very low, 1,000-fold 265 (dogs) or 10,000-fold (pigs) lower than in kidney. Among these organs, pigs exhibit the highest mRNA 266 levels in trachea, around 20-fold less in lungs and very little in turbinates. In dogs the mRNA level is 267 around 20-fold higher in lungs compared with the trachea, no mRNA was detected in turbinates. It is 268 thus tempting to speculate that the low ACE2 levels in the respiratory tract prevent infection of pigs 269 and the efficient replication and hence spread of the virus to contact animals in dogs. However, 270 efficient receptor binding is only the first step in virus infection. Beyond that, numerous restriction 271 factors have been identified in cells from various species that prevent successful virus replication. Our 272 results mean more experiments and monitoring should be done to explore the source of animal 273 infection. 274",

All the experiments were approved by the 415 committee on the ethics of animal experiments. Samples of dog and pig including heart, liver, spleen, 416 lung, kidney, duodenum, bronchus and turbinate, were used for quantitative real-time PCR (q-RT-PCR) 417to determine the content of mRNA encoding ACE2. The kidney of a beagle or Felis catus were used for 418 PCR amplification of the full length of ACE2. A total of 50 mg of each sample was ground into powder 419 in liquid nitrogen and transferred to DEPC treated EP tube before liquid nitrogen volatilizes. Total RNA 420 was extracted using 1 mL TRIzol (Nanjing Vazyme biotechnology), and 1 \u03bcg cDNA was synthesized using 421 the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the 422 manufacturer's instructions. 423Amplification and detection of ACE2 by q-RT-PCR 424The primers used to amplify the full length of ACE2 gene sequence of cat and dog by PCR included3\u2032. The 25 \u03bcL PCR reaction mixtures contained, 1 \u03bcL each 429 primer, 1 \u03bcL cDNA template, 12.5 \u03bcL 2 \u00d7 Phanta Max Buffer, 0.5 \u03bcL dNTP Mix (10 mM each), 0.5 \u03bcL 430 phanta Max Super-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Nanjing Vazyme biotechnology Co., Ltd), and 8.5 \u03bcL 431 ddH 2 O. PCR conditions were as follows: pre-denaturation at 95 0 C for 5 min , 35 cycles of 95 0 C for 30 432 s , 62 0 C for 30 s , 72 0 C for 2 min and 30 s, and a final extension at 72 0 C for 10 min. Positive amplicons 433 were sequenced by Comate Biosciences Company Limited (Changchun, Jilin) using an ABI 3730 434 sequencer, and consensus sequences were obtained from at least three independent determinations. Q-RT-PCR was used to determine the content of ACE2 in different tissues of dog and pig. The total 436 volume of q-RT-PCR reaction was 20 \u03bcL, including 10 \u03bcL 2x Aceq qPCR mixture (Nanjing Vazyme 437 biotechnology), 0.4 \u03bcL of forward and reverse primer, 2 \u03bcL of template, and the remaining volume of 438 nuclease free water. The following procedure was used for amplification on a Roche lightcycle\u00ae 96 439 instrument: 95 0 C 600 s; 45 cycles of 95 0 C 10 s, 55 0 C 10 s, 72 0 C 20 s. \u03b2-Actin was selected as the 440 internal parameter.
