There are no nonhuman hosts for this organism. The organism is highly infectious, having a fecal-oral route of transmission. Infection can occur with the ingestion of as few as 10 to 100 organisms. Intestinal damage results primarily from direct invasion of the organism into the colonic epithelium and, to a lesser extent, from the production of an enterotoxin. The Shigella toxin is composed of an A subunit, which is catalytic, and a B subunit, which is responsible for binding. Stool volume is typically low and the diarrhea may be bloody, mucoid, or watery. The endoscopic appearance of shigellosis shows intense involvement of the rectosigmoid with variable proximal involvement. Approximately 15% of cases present with pancolitis.

The organisms are common inhabitants of the human GI tract, and most strains do not have the virulence factors necessary to cause disease. The primary pathogenic strains of E. coli and the syndromes that they cause are listed next.\u2022\nEnterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) accounts for most cases of travelers\u2019 diarrhea but is relatively rare in the United States. Fecal-oral transmission through the ingestion of contaminated food or water is the primary means of spread. Disease is produced by the adherence of ETEC to the mucosa, followed by the production of toxins (heat-labile cholera-like toxins). Invasion of the mucosa does not occur. The illness is usually self-limited, lasting 3 to 5 days. Symptoms include watery diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Occasionally associated with this illness is low-grade fever and, rarely, bloody diarrhea.\u2022\nEnteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) lacks invasive properties. Disease results from its enteroadherent properties. Illness caused by EPEC affects primarily young children (younger than age 3 years) and must be considered as a probable cause of nursery and pediatric outbreaks of diarrhea. Profuse watery diarrhea, which may become chronic, is the usual presentation. As with ETEC-caused illnesses, those caused by EPEC rarely result in bloody diarrhea.\u2022\nEnteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) can invade the intestinal mucosa and cause acute dysentery. EIEC strains share characteristics with Shigella sp. and are not commonly found in the United States. Infants under age 1 are most susceptible to EIEC strains in developed countries.\u2022\nEnteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) was identified in the 1980s and is responsible for diarrhea in children in developing countries, prolonged diarrhea in HIV infection in developing countries, and travelers\u2019 diarrhea.\u2022\nShiga-toxin E. coli (STEC; also known as enterohemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC]) has a number of serotypes, but E. coli O157:H7 is the most important. E. coli O157:H7 is acquired primarily from the ingestion of contaminated beef, although outbreaks have also been associated with contaminated water, raw milk, unpasteurized juices, and person-to-person transmission among household members. Drinking water contaminated with farm waste has been implicated in several recent large outbreaks. The typical clinical presentation begins with severe abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea followed by rapid progression to bloody diarrhea. The organism is not invasive but produces a Shiga-like toxin, which is cytotoxic to vascular endothelium. The disease can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (less than 10% of cases). The very young and very old are the most susceptible to fatal complications. The most common cause of acute renal failure in North American children is O157:H7 infection. This is the only E. coli species that will be tested when a stool culture is referred to a lab. Typically, the lab does not evaluate for ETEC, EPEC, EIEC, and EAEC.\n",

The incubation period from ingestion to symptoms (nausea, emesis, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea) is approximately 3 hours (range, 1 to 6 hours). S. aureus favors growth in foods with high sugar content (e.g., custard) and high salt intake (e.g., ham). Recovery is generally complete in 24 to 48 hours. B. cereus is a spore-forming, gram-positive rod that produces a diarrheogenic, heat-labile enterotoxin. Vomiting can occur within 2 hours of ingestion of contaminated food. Almost all persons with B. cereus develop diarrhea. Meat and rice are the most common food vehicles for infection. Clostridium perfringens also produces an enterotoxin.
