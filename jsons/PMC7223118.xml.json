A gastric-by-pass operation had been performed eight years before this admission, and afterwards the patient developed an anorexic behavior and a severe malnutrition, resulting in the loss of 100 kg. Seven days prior to admission to the local hospital the patient terminated oral intake and was brought to the hospital by relatives. Body weight at admission was 145 kg, the patient was considered severely malnutritioned and was admitted to a surgical ward due to abdominal pain. Bilateral leg swelling was present, and s-albumin was 8 mg/L. Parenteral nutrition as well as enteral nutrition was started with 1800 kcal/day, and albumin was administrated. After three days the patient developed a stiff neck and decreased consciousness. Lumbar puncture was performed with no abnormal findings. Due to suspected septicemia antibiotics was started. The patient\u2019s consciousness continued to decrease and intubation was necessary, hence the patient was referred to the local ICU. Caloric intake was reduced, and phosphate was administered. The next day the patient developed fasciculations in left hand, left part of the face, and anisocoria. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed which revealed cerebral edema (Fig. 1). The patient was admitted to our university hospital.",

Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated as the difference between mean MAP and ICP. At arrival in the ICU, initial arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed severe acidosis with pH 7.09, base excess \u2212 19.3 mEq/L, standard bicarbonate 9.9 mmol/L and lactate 8.4 mmol/L. The patient was circulatory unstable with need of high doses of norepinephrine, and the oxygen demand was 70%. A cardiac echo examination revealed a dilated right ventricle and severe tricuspid leakage. To optimize contractility, and reduce afterload due to right ventricle failure, intravenous levosimendan and inhalation of sildenafil was initiated. Abdominal echo examination showed ascites but no portal thrombosis. Due to severe acidosis and anuria, hemodialysis was started. Shortly after this the patient developed atrial fibrillation, which was electrically cardioverted to sinus rhythm with frequent bursts of ventricular extrasystolic beats. Laboratory findings are presented in Table 1. Blood chemistry was analysed in the ISO 15189 accredited laboratory at Ume\u00e5 University hospital. Plasma levels of albumin, phosphate, magnesium, vitamin B12 and folate were analysed by Roche ALBP, PHOS2, MG2, Elecsys Vitamin B12, Elecsys Folate III reagents on Cobas c8000 analysers. Zinc was analysed by Sentinel reagent on Cobas c8000 and INR by MediRox Owren's PT GHI 131 reagent on ACL TOP 700 analysers. Blood cell counts were analysed on Sysmex XE-5000 and blood gas analyses were performed using ABL 800 (Triolab, Gothenburg, Sweden).",

ICP, MAP and CPP from day 2 to day 10 are shown in Fig. 2.

Mean PRx over the entire monitoring time was \u2212 0.06 \u00b1 0.18 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD)). The compliance related index \u201cRAP\u201d (relationship between pulse wave amplitude and mean of ICP) was calculated on the same time basis, but as the correlation between the pulse wave amplitude of ICP and mean ICP over each time interval (Fig. 4) [10].

During some time periods the distance between density lines in the spectrum is larger than 4 h, indicating that there were not enough 2-minute intervals without arrhythmias to obtain a proper 4 h estimate of the spectral density. From the start of high frequency data recording (day 2 in the ICU) and until day 6 HRV was nearly absent. From approximately day 6 to day 8 there was a successive increase of the power in the very low-frequency region (VLF) near 0.05 Hz. A notable peak in the low-frequency region (LF, around 0.10 Hz) became present from day 8 until the end of recording on day 10. Finally, from day 2 to day 8 there was a small high frequency (HF) component around 0.3 Hz, which corresponded to the ventilator frequency. The HF peak increased in magnitude at day 8, corresponding to the timepoint where the patient\u2019s consciousness increased, and spontaneous assisted ventilation was established.",

In two recent studies, calorie restriction improved survival RFS [12, 13], and calorie restriction has been recommended for patients at risk for RFS, or patients with established RFS [6]. The patient developed symptoms of RFS after 3 days, which is consistent with previous studies of symptom onset [14]. The condition described can be compared to an internal severe neurotrauma. Cerebral oedema in RFS is not previously described to our knowledge, even though encephalopathy is reported as a possible consequence [3, 5, 15, 16]. One may speculate that the brain edema and cerebral ischemia would have been less substantial if initial treatment had followed the NICE guidelines.

High ICP, around 20 mmHg, in itself seems to be a prognostic indicator for bad clinical outcome [17] and has been demonstrated to be associated with bad outcome in trauma patients [18, 19], patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage [20] and patients with bacterial meningitis [21, 22]. In our patient, the increased ICP in combination with cardiovascular instability and arterial hypotension during the first days resulted in periods with low CPP. Most probably this elicited persistent brain damage since ICP and CPP are the main parameters besides direct cerebrovascular injuries that affect the cerebral blood flow.",

            "text": "Cerebrovascular pressure reactivity is part of the cerebral autoregulation, and it reflects the capacity of cerebral arteries and arterioles to react to changes in transmural pressure. It may be assessed using the pressure reactivity index (PRx) [9], in which MAP is correlated against ICP to indicate an active or passive vasoconstriction in response to changes in MAP. However, some studies also indicate that PRx may be affected by many other factors apart from pressure reactivity, such as alterations in temperature [23], arterial glucose concentration [24] and red blood cell transfusion [25]. Generally, negative PRx values reflect preserved pressure reactivity while the more positive PRx is, the more disturbed the autoregulation is considered to be. Critical values of PRx have been described, where a threshold of 0.25 has been shown to maximize the prediction of survival, whereas a threshold of 0.05 predict favorable outcome with the highest probability [26]. One may speculate that in a seriously ill patient with cerebral edema, high ICP and low CPP, the cerebrovascular autoregulation is likely to be affected. This should be reflected in parameters applied to assess autoregulation, but according to PRx (Fig. 3a) this patient had an intact cerebrovascular pressure reactivity from day 2 to 8 when treated in the ICU. On day 9 and start of day 10, PRx increased considerably, indicating a disturbed cerebrovascular autoregulation. This was not in line with the patient\u2019s clinical progression, and this finding is most likely related to the reduced sedation at this point. When looking at PRx in more detail (Fig. 3b), a reduced pressure reactivity could be seen during a few 4-hour periods when the index was close to or higher than 0.2. A PRx > 0.2 for a period of six hours or more has been found to be a strong indicator for mortality [27]. In our patient, even though PRx corresponded to a compromised pressure reactivity a few times, most of the time, and as a mean over the whole monitoring period, PRx indicated an intact autoregulation (-0.06 \u00b1 0.18, mean \u00b1 SD). Considering the severe state of this patient these results are conflicting, and it puts the suitability of indirect measurements of cerebral autoregulation based on the PRx index in question regarding RFS patients with cerebral engagement.",

A RAP index close to zero while still having a low ICP corresponds to a preserved intracranial compliance, since there is no correlation between a change in ICP pulse wave amplitude and mean ICP, while a RAP index approaching + 1 or negative values indicates a compromised compliance and an exhausted compensatory reserve respectively [29]. In our patient the RAP index varied between zero and 0.5 with a mean of 0.23. This could be compared to a study investigating the effect of decompressive craniectomy on ICP and cerebrospinal compensation following TBI, where the median (interquartile) RAP index of 27 patients with TBI was 0.4 (0.33;0.68) prior to, and 0.14 (0.12; 0.22) after decompressive craniectomy [31]. Additionally, in a study investigating 358 patients with moderate-to-severe TBI, the mean RAP was 0.638 \u00b1 0.208 [32]. Thus, this severely ill RFS patient seemed to have a compensatory reserve varying within the interval from normal to low throughout the entire monitoring time, without signs of complete exhaustion, and the overall trend in RAP, from day 2 to day 10, was decreasing. Since ICP also decreased during the same time period this implies that the compensatory reserve improved slightly during the treatment period.",

However, results are conflicting describing both parasympathetic and sympathetic dominance [35]. Our patient was initially hemodynamically unstable, but was stabilized when the HRV recording started on day 2. The lack of HRV during day 2 to day 6 in the ICU could reflect a disturbed autonomic regulation. However, a loss of HRV has also been reported during general anesthesia [36], when the sympathetic\nnervous activity is markedly reduced. In our patient, there were nearly parallel changes in HRV and sedation level. From day 6 and on, the sedation level was gradually reduced, which was also when the activity in the VLF component started to increase. On approximately day 8, an LF component appeared and the HF component increased in magnitude. This was also the day when extra sedation was given due to increased alertness resulting in increased ICP and MAP. From day 9 and on, the sedation was stopped and HRV was also markedly increased. Since no HRV was recorded after\nday 10, we could not evaluate the parasympathetic/sympathetic balance when the patient was without sedation. Note that the changes in HRV were not due to cardiac arrhythmias, since there were a substantial number of 2-min periods without arrhythmias throughout the recording. Thus, we speculate that the changes seen in the HRV were related to the level of sedation as well as autonomous recovery.",
