Methods: One hundred sixty-four patients with noninfluenza viral pneumonia were divided into IFN\u03b11b and control groups. The IFN\u03b11b group received routine treatment + aerosol inhalation of recombinant human IFN\u03b11b injection (50 \u03bcg \u00d7 2 injections, bid). The control group received routine treatment + IFN analog (two injections, bid). Overall response rate (ORR) of five kinds clinical symptoms. Further outcomes were daily average score and the response rate of each of the symptoms above. Results: A total of 163 patients were included in the full analysis set (FAS) and 151 patients were included in the per-protocol set (PPS). After 7 days of treatment, ORR of clinical symptoms was higher in IFN\u03b11b group than that in control group for both the FAS and PPS. Moreover, after 7 days of treatment, the daily score of three efficacy indexes including expectoration, respiratory rate, and pulmonary rales were improved. The ORRs for expectoration and pulmonary rales were higher in the IFN\u03b11b group than in the control group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences of the ORRs for coughing, chest pain and respiratory rate between the two groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of adverse events was 6.5% (n = 5) in IFN\u03b11b group and 3.5% (n = 3) in control group (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Aerosol inhalation of recombinant human IFN\u03b11b is safe and it can improve the clinical symptoms of noninfluenza viral pneumonia.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children in developing countries and the elderly in developed countries. Among the pathogens which cause communityacquired pneumonia (CAP), viral pneumonia is attracting increasing attention. It occurs in approximately 200 million people each year worldwide, while adults and children each accounting for 50% of cases [1] . In recent years, with the development of molecular assays, respiratory viruses have become the leading CAP pathogens [2] . CAP is the most common infectious disease in the United States and the eighth cause of death [3] . It is reported that the economic burden of CAP in the United States alone was estimated to exceed $17 billion per year [4] . A CAP study in the United States found that the three most common adult pneumonia pathogens were rhinovirus, influenza virus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other pathogens include human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and adenovirus [2] . Common viruses include influenza virus (8%), rhinovirus (5.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (2.2%), and coronavirus (3.3%) [5] . In recent years, the mortality of newly developed avian influenza viruses (H7N9, H5N6) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was high. Once 48 h passed the infection, neuraminidase inhibitors were ineffective for influenza virus infections. Currently, no proved effective antiviral treatment is available to treat and prevent MERS. MERS-CoV is highly homologous to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), therefore, the experience gained from SARS treatment, including the use of IFN\u03b1, may be helpful in the treatment of MERS-CoV infection. Through in vitro studies, it was found that MERS-CoV was 50 to 100 times more sensitive to IFN\u03b1 than SARS virus. Therefore, IFN\u03b1 might be an effective treatment for MERS [6] . IFN\u03b1 was shown to be effective in patients with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus disease [7, 8] . Sakai et al. reported the application of IFN\u03b1 to patients with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus disease resulting in unremarkable suppression of lymphocyte proliferation [8] . An open-label trial of systemic IFN improved 28-day survival in patients with ARDS [9] .",

IFN has broadspectrum antiviral and immunomodulatory effects and is classified as type I, type II or type III based on different binding receptors [10] . Among them, type I IFN (mainly IIB IFN) plays an important role in the control of viral infections. IFN\u03b1 establishes an antiviral state by inducing cells to produce antiviral proteins, which prevents viral infection [11] . Aerosol inhalation is one route way for IFN administration, which could not only improve efficacy but also reduce the IFN blood concentration in normal tissues, thereby reducing adverse reactions [12] . In clinical practice, IFN\u03b1 has been widely used to treat various viral diseases in children in some disease [13, 14] , but few studies have been conducted to investigate its effect in the treatment of viral pneumonia in adults. Moreover, there were also no consensus on how to use IFN\u03b1 in adults with viral pneumonia.",

However, results from these trials have yielded inconsistent results. In addition, other studies indicated that IFN\u03b1 has pathogenic effects during acute and chronic infections [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Together, these findings suggest that the relationship between virus replication and or related pathogenesis and the kinetics of IFN expression, whether endogenous or after exogenous administration, contributed to the variability of outcomes. IFN\u03b1 therapy has been used to treat patients with severe respiratory disease caused by CoVs, with similarly inconsistent outcomes [24] . In particular, IFN\u03b1 treatment of patients with MERS failed to improve survival [15, 25, 26] . For example, in one study, IFN treatment prolonged survival when assessed at 14 days, but not at 28 days [15] . Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for MDA5 in sensing CoV RNA and thereby initiating the IFN response [27] . The majority of these studies used macrophages infected with a murine CoV, mouse hepatitis virus, which is macrophage tropic [28, 29] . Since human CoVs predominantly infect airway and alveolar epithelial cells and PRR expression is cell-type specific, we examined the PRRs necessary for IFN production specifically in airway and alveolar epithelial cells using mice transduced with Ad5-hDPP4 and then infected with the human EMC/2012 strain of MERS-CoV. Ad5 predominantly infects epithelial cells and not myeloid cells [30] . Although there was no significant difference of chest pain between the two groups. It could still be found that in early 4 days of the treatment, the average score of chest pain seemed to be lower than IFN\u03b11b group. It was reported that the treatment of IFN\u03b11b could lead to some adverse events, including pulmonary effusion cardiac insufficiency [31] . Therefore, the mechanism and reason of the early chest pain still needed to be further investigated.",

However, studies in humans failed to conclusively establish the beneficial effects of rIFN therapy [25, 26, 33] , possibly because of delayed administration relative to peak virus titers. In the early stage of treatment (days 2 to 3), expectoration, respiratory rate, and pulmonary rales were improved. Virus replication occurs in the early stage, therefore, early treatment may better inhibit virus replication. This study shows that IFN is more effective in patients diagnosed in the early stage, indicating that early treatment is advantageous for disease control and remission, although late treatment is also effective. When used in the systemic therapy, IFNs are mostly administered by an intramuscular injection. The most frequent adverse effects are flu-like symptoms, especially increased body temperature. In current study, no significant difference of the adverse events was observed between the IFN\u03b11b group and the control group, suggesting that aerosol inhalation of recombinant human IFN\u03b11b injection was safe and well tolerated.",
