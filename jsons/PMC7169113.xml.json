            "text": "The appearance of viral mutants resistant to antiviral compounds is a major public health concern. The continuous generation of such mutants is a characteristic of RNA viruses, many of which, for example, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and DENV (all with a single\u2010stranded, positive RNA genome), cause serious diseases. The genome of RNA viruses acts both as a template for replication and as an mRNA. During replication, mutations are introduced into the genome via errors in the action of viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase; this can generate mutants that may greatly contribute to viral proliferation\u2014although it can also lead to the disappearance of the virus if such changes leave it non\u2010viable or induce acute pathogenesis in the host, the so\u2010called error catastrophe (for reviews, see 1, 2). Viruses must, therefore, strive to reach an equilibrium that allows for adaptive fitness without compromising their persistence. To accomplish this, RNA viruses have developed an information storage system that does not code for proteins, but for specific, complex and highly conserved, folded genomic regions that play direct, functional roles in the viral cycle. These viral regions present an adaptive behaviour that has evolved with the selective pressure to achieve high genetic robustness 3, 4, 5. As a result, mutations in viral RNA genomes present minor incidence in the functional elements 4.",

The secondary structure is the result of double\u2010stranded and single\u2010stranded regions arrangements, for example, helices closed by loops. The tertiary structure is determined by the relationships established between secondary structure elements. The combination of these two folding levels establishes the final shape of the RNA molecules, the so\u2010called RNA structurome 6. This conformational view has prompted the search of structured RNA motifs as FRDs, not only in the viral genomes 7 but also in the transcriptome of all living organisms (for a review, see 6).",

One of the FRDs that have attracted the most attention is the IRES. IRES regions direct the recruitment of the cellular translation machinery in a cap\u2010independent manner 11. Similarly, viral replication and maturation are regulated by the direct binding of viral polymerases and related cofactors to FRDs in the 3\u2032 end of the genomic RNA, as well as by direct RNA\u2013RNA interactions between distant regions of the virus genome 12.",

            "text": "Many viral genomes achieve efficient translation initiation by the use of IRESs, which replace IFs by the combined use of several FRDs. These regions present high sequence and structural diversity across different viral groups, which define the mechanisms by which they promote translation. IRESs are therefore divided into four groups 16 according to common IF requirements (Figure 1):\nPacked IRESs. This group encompasses the IRES elements located in the IGR of the genome of the Dicistroviridae family (whose members infect insects). The folding of these elements represents a highly conserved, compact structure that, via the so\u2010called all\u2010RNA\u2010based mechanism, mediates the recruitment of the ribosome with no need of additional protein factors 17. The IRES structure can be split into three domains (Figure 1(a)), each defined by a PK motif (PKI\u2013PKIII). This conformation is considered the \u2018prefolded\u2019 isoform of the IRES. Domain PKIII mimics the folding of the initiator transfer RNA (tRNA), allowing it to occupy the P and E sites of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This promotes structural changes in the IRES that finally allow the binding of the 60S particle and the efficient initiation of translation from a non\u2010AUG codon 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Thus, the conformation of PKIII replaces the need for an initiator tRNA 23.\nExtended IRES with compact regions. The prototype of this group, the HCV IRES, folds as an extended region with tightly compact domains. It is mostly contained in the 5\u2032UTR of the RNA genome but also spans a short stretch of the coding sequence (Figure 1(b)) 24, 25. It can be divided into two major domains (II and III) 26 and a short stem\u2010loop containing the start codon (domain IV) 27. The extended folding of the IRES allows for the proper coaxial alignment of domains II and III on either side of a complex PK structure 28. This allows easy access for the 40S ribosomal particle; subsequent IRES conformational changes directly position the appropriate start codon in the P site 29. Then, binding of eIF3 at the IIIabc junction aids the incorporation of the ternary complex eIF2\u2010tRNAi\nMet and the joining of the 60S subunit (for a review, see 30). Interestingly, the requirement for eIF2\u2010tRNAi\nMet can be minimised under certain stress conditions 31, providing a selective advantage for efficient HCV propagation even in unfavourable physiological environments. This suggests that an IRES may change its mode of function depending on environmental conditions.\nFlexible IRESs. These are mainly represented by picornavirus type II IRESs (FMDV and EMCV among others; Figure 1(c)) 9. Their overall 3D structure reflects a greater degree of flexibility than that shown by IGR or HCV\u2010like IRESs before ribosomal recruitment 32, 33, 34, 35. Nonetheless, they retain compact self\u2010folded stem\u2010loops and a GNRA sequence motif included within a tetraloop that directs the structural organisation of central domain 3 32. Flexible IRESs cannot directly recruit the 40S ribosomal subunit; rather, they first bind eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF4B and eIF3 at domains 4 and 5 36, 37 to finally induce conformational rearrangements that promote the recruitment of the 43S complex. The presence of domains 2 and 3 is crucial because they bind additional ITAFs, such as the PTB, PABP and ITAF45 38, 39, 40, 41. ITAFs are thought to provide chaperone activity but may also help overcome cell restrictions under stress conditions. Hence, the flexible folding provides specific biophysical properties that define a characteristic mode of action.\nInducible IRES. In lentiviruses, the use of IRES elements is restricted to certain environmental conditions, the initiation of protein synthesis normally being accomplished by a cap\u2010dependent mechanism. Two different IRES elements lie within the HIV genome: one in the 5\u2032UTR, which only operates in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle 42, 43, and one embedded within the coding sequence (Figure 1(d)) 42, 44. Enormous efforts have gone into fathoming the induction mechanism(s) of these elements, but without much success. It is well known that the 5\u2032UTR of HIV\u20101 RNA can adopt two different conformations, but a direct translational regulation mediated by conformational exchanges in the genomic RNA has been ruled out 45. Furthermore, it seems likely that unknown ITAFs are differentially loaded by each conformer, providing a sophisticated and opportunistic viral strategy aimed at overcoming environmental difficulties. It is tempting to propose that the induction of the IRES within the coding sequence is further modulated by long\u2010distance RNA\u2013RNA interactions with the 5\u2032UTR, thus promoting alternative conformations that might regulate its functioning 46.\n",

The oriR has been shown to play an important role in viral replication via its direct recruitment of viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase and host cell factors such as PCBP, the La autoantigen and eEF1A 15. A common architecture at the 3\u2032UTR can be inferred for all the members of the same viral group (Figure 2(a)). Thus, rhinoviruses have a single stem\u2010loop (named Y), polioviruses contain two stem\u2010loops (X and Y) and coxsackieviruses have three consecutive stem\u2010loops (X, Y and Z) 48. The presence of two or more stem\u2010loops defines a typical PK motif involving the apical loops of domains X and Y 50, 51.
