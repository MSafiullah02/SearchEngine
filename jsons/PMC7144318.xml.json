In addition to human beings, coronavirus can also infect many kinds of mammals and birds. Some coronaviruses can cause diseases in humans, livestock and poultry. Before 2019, there are six known human coronaviruses, belonging to \u03b1-coronavirus and \u03b2-coronavirus, causing respiratory diseases of different severity, including four common coronaviruses and two highly pathogenic emerging coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In December 2019, unexplained pneumonia (later named as coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China [1\u20134]. The initial patient was related to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. A new type of \u03b2-coronavirus was found by unbiased high-throughput sequencing of samples from patients with pneumonia. A new type of coronavirus was isolated from human respiratory epithelial cells, which belongs to the subgenus Sabevirus of the subfamily Coronavirus [4]. Different from the previously isolated MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, this virus is the seventh coronavirus that can infect humans and is named as SARS-CoV-2.",

S protein is responsible for the virus attachment and entry to the target cells, which initiate the infection process. S protein plays key roles in induction of protective humoral and cellular immunity during SARS-CoV infection. Consequently, the S protein was considered as the most attractive target for SARS-CoV vaccine and therapeutic development [8\u201311]. In face of the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, a variety of approaches have been employed to develop prophylactic and therapeutic measures, including whole inactivated vaccine, subunit vaccine, RNA-based vaccine, viral vectored vaccines, monoclonal neutralizing antibodies, fusion inhibitors, most of which was designed to target the S protein. However, due to its high infectivity and pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 should be handled in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities, which has limited the development of anti-viral measures. The accessibility of the live virus stain is another major barrier to develop candidate vaccines and therapeutics.",

For this VSV pseudovirus system, the backbone was provided by VSV G pseudotyped virus (G*\u0394G-VSV) that packages expression cassettes for firefly luciferase instead of VSV-G in the VSV genome. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1.S2 (30 \u03bcg for a T75 flask) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, L3000015) following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Twenty-four hours later, the transfected cells were infected with G*\u0394G-VSV with a multiplicity of four. Two hours after infection, cells were washed with PBS three times, and then new complete culture medium was added. Twenty-four hours post infection, SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses containing culture supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.45-\u03bcm pore size, Millipore, SLHP033RB) and stored at \u221270\u00b0C in 2-ml aliquots until use. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was determined using a single-use aliquot from the pseudovirus bank; all stocks were used only once to avoid inconsistencies that could have resulted from repeated freezing-thawing cycles. For titration of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, a 2-fold initial dilution was made in hexaplicate wells of 96-well culture plates followed by serial 3-fold dilutions (nine dilutions in total). The last column served as the cell control without the addition of pseudovirus. Then, the 96-well plates were seeded with trypsin-treated mammalian cells adjusted to a pre-defined concentration. After 24 h incubation in a 5% CO2 environment at 37\u00b0C, the culture supernatant was aspirated gently to leave 100 \u03bcl in each well; then, 100 \u03bcl of luciferase substrate (Perkinelmer, 6066769) was added to each well. Two min after incubation at room temperature, 150 \u03bcl of lysate was transferred to white solid 96-well plates for the detection of luminescence using a microplate luminometer (PerkinElmer, Ensight). The positive well was determined as ten-fold relative luminescence unit (RLU) values higher than the cell background. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was calculated using the Reed\u2013Muench method, as described previously [13,18,19].",

The highest titre was observed in a range of 1.25 \u00d7 104\u20132.50 \u00d7 104/well when equal amount of pseudovirus preparations was tested (Figure 3(A)). It is noted that the linear correlation coefficients (R2) obtained at cell inoculum from 1.25 \u00d7 104 to 2.50 \u00d7 104/well were found to be greater than 0.96, revealing an excellent linear curve fitting. Moreover, when neutralization assays were performed with different cell inocula, the EC50 values were similar with cell numbers ranging from 6.25 \u00d7 103 to 5.00 \u00d7 104/well (Figure 3(B)). However, when the input cells numbers were more than 5.00 \u00d7 104/well, the R2 values for both titration and inhibition assay would decrease dramatically. Given these findings, we chose 5.00 \u00d7 104/well for subsequent experiments.
