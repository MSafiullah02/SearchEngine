Our virtual clerkship generated much more interest, with the enrollment cap met almost immediately after the course was offered. Given the paucity of competing in-person clerkships, some of the students taking our virtual clerkship may not have the same level of interest in radiation oncology as prior rotating students. However, 67% of the cohort did express interest in \"learning more about radiation oncology,\" with 92% having had no prior exposure to radiation oncology. Further, over half were women.
