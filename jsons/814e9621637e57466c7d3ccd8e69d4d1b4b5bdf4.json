Drugs may induce specific respiratory reactions, or the lungs may be affected as part of a generalized response. Druginduced lung injury (DLI) can involve the airways, lung parenchyma, mediastinum, pleura, pulmonary vasculature, and/or the neuromuscular system. The most common form of DLI is drug-induced interstitial lung disease. There are no disease types specific to DLI, and DLIs are diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings, chest CT images, and histopathologic findings. The first principle of management of DLI is early detection and cessation of treatment with the suspected drug. Response to corticosteroid therapy depends on the histopathologic pattern of drug-induced interstitial lung disease. Prognosis depends on the specific drug and underlying clinical, physiologic, and pathologic severity of lung disease. To minimize DLI morbidity and mortality, all health-care providers should be familiar with the possible adverse effects of medications they prescribe. Individual variability in drug response is an important concern in clinical practice and drug development. Such variability is multifactorial and includes extrinsic factors such as environmental features and genetic and intrinsic factors that affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs.",

Methotrexate, for example, causes acute granulomatous DILD, which mimics an opportunistic infection [27] . Drugs can produce nearly all histopathologic patterns of interstitial pneumonia, including HP, OP, DAD, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), EP, pulmonary hemorrhage, and granulomatous pneumonitis. Most drugs in a comparable class induce a similar pattern of pulmonary involvement, which suggests a common cytopathic mechanism.
