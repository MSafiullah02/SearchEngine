None of the hundreds of research reports published to date addressed caring for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the ambulatory setting, and it became clear that one of the first challenges we faced was to gain an understanding of the typical presentation and early natural history of mild and moderate COVID-19 to guide our care during the pandemic.",

In a retrospective study of 191 patients admitted to two hospitals in Wuhan, China, the initial several days of SARS-CoV-2 infection involved fever (94%) and cough (79%). 1 But these presentations were likely biased by being only those of hospitalized patients, and hospital admission was often predicated on testing positive for COVID-19 in an ambulatory \"fever clinic\". Referral to a fever clinic in Wuhan, China required the presence of both fever and at least one respiratory symptom, likely limiting the spectrum of disease gastrointestinal symptoms. 2, 3 In our clinic, patients with various permutations of mild symptoms including nasal congestion, cough without fever, sore throat, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, myalgias, back pain and fatigue have tested positive for COVID-19. We have also cared for many patients who experienced severe symptoms during the initial days including fever, cough, myalgias and exhaustion. These initial days of infection can range from mild upper respiratory symptoms, cough and fatigue suggestive of bronchitis, sore throat and fever, abdominal pain with diarrhea or influenza-like illnesses. Of note, though fever is a common symptom over the course of COVID-19, temperature elevations can be mild, particularly at the outset of illness. 4 One of the only early hints to the diagnosis is loss of smell 5 which many of our patients report losing during the first few days of illness.",

The most useful factor to monitor is oxygen saturation which often drops precipitously with exertion, even in some previously healthy patients.

The description of dyspnea is often helpful as well. In our patients with COVID-related anxiety, the dyspnea tends to occur at rest or when trying to fall asleep but does not become more pronounced when participating in daily activities. Patients with COVID-related anxiety often describe the sensation of not being able to get enough air into their lungs, while with SARS-CoV-2 infection dyspnea is consistently worse with exertion.",

A nuanced understanding of the typical presentation and natural history of COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting can help determine the appropriate timing of follow-up -patients who have begun to develop dyspnea should be followed closely in the following 72 hours for evidence of worsening dyspnea particularly with exertion -and permit clinicians to more easily distinguish COVID-19 from other common and treatable illnesses.",
