If the nose is significantly congested, 0.5 mL of oxymetazoline nasal spray, loaded into a tuberculin syringe may be sprayed into the nose, and the examination can be repeated in 10 minutes. The goal of this thorough nasal examination is to identify purulent secretions draining from the sinuses, not just secretions stagnating in the nose. A simple viral URTI causes damage to the delicate ciliated respiratory epithelium in the nose. At the same time, inflammation induced by the viral infection will stimulate mucus secretion from goblet cells. This mucus may stagnate in the nose, along with neutrophils. Thus, thick, colored, nasal secretions often develop in the setting of an acute viral URTI, and colored secretions in the nasal cavity are not a specific finding for acute bacterial sinusitis. Also, the apparent absence of purulent secretions in the nose or draining in the oropharynx cannot rule out sinusitis.

The common cold is most frequently caused by rhinovirus, but also by coronaviruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses. Although clinical presentation can vary, probably as a result of host and viral factors, typical symptoms include rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and obstruction, facial pain and pressure, headache, sneezing, hoarseness, sore throat, malaise, chills, and cough. Rhinorrhea and sneezing are the most common symptomatic complaints, and headache occurs in 30% of cases. 7 These symptoms overlap significantly with acute bacterial sinusitis and acute exacerbations of allergic or nonallergic rhinitis. That the common cold is really a form of acute viral rhinosinusitis was demonstrated by Gwaltney and colleagues 8 who performed sinus computer tomography (CT) scans on a sample of subjects with the common cold. Most subjects (87%) had findings of sinus inflammation in the maxillary or ethmoid sinuses. So it is now clear that a viral URTI is not just a viral acute rhinitis but actually a form of rhinosinusitis. The common cold is generally self-limited, but antibiotics are prescribed in 30% to 78% of cases that present to a health care provider. 9 In a landmark study by Gwaltney and colleagues 7 the duration of symptoms associated with acute viral URTI, mostly due to rhinovirus, was carefully detailed. The median duration of illness was 7 days, but 25% of subjects had illness for 2 weeks. A small percentage of viral URTIs leads to bacterial sinusitis, otitis media, or exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus a simple viral URTI can cause significant morbidity.",

The pathogens responsible for acute bacterial sinusitis have been well characterized and include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. 10 Rarely, acute maxillary sinusitis can develop from an odontogenic source. A diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis may be made in individuals with the symptoms of a viral URTI that have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after 5 to 7 days. In some cases, a clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is appropriate if symptoms are out of proportion to a typical URTI. 6 The gold standard for diagnosing acute bacterial sinusitis is a maxillary sinus puncture with culture of sinus contents. However, because of the discomfort and potential complications of this procedure, antral puncture is rarely performed for clinical purposes. As has been noted, the signs and symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis do not vary significantly from a viral URTI. Physical examination findings are unreliable, and because a viral URTI will produce inflammatory changes, radiologic studies are not helpful in differentiating viral from bacterial disease. 1 Williams and colleagues 11 performed a prospective study among 247 patients referred for acute sinusitis. Of the 16 symptoms examined, no one symptom was both sensitive and specific. However, regression analysis identified 5 symptoms and signs (maxillary toothache, abnormal transillumination, poor response to decongestants, purulent secretions, and colored nasal discharge by history) that if combined in the same patient, yielded a 92% probability of sinusitis. The findings from this study are often repeated in clinical texts. However, this study did not use correlation with sinus aspirate culture results, nor have other studies that examined signs and symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis. Thus, consideration of the time course and severity of a patient's symptoms are considered to be the best methods to distinguish viral from bacterial acute rhinosinusitis. Such an approach errs on the side of overtreatment with antibiotics, but a more specific approach entails inordinate cost and potential patient harm.",

Physical examination abnormalities that are detectable on a routine head and neck examination may be absent in chronic sinusitis. Widespread use of sinus imaging is costly, and most generalists who treat chronic sinusitis do not use nasal endoscopy. For these reasons, a consensus statement published in 1997 recommended that the clinical diagnosis of chronic sinusitis rely primarily on the patient's history, using a set of major and minor clinical factors to make the diagnosis. 13 However, when this approach was evaluated in clinical studies that combined symptomatic history with objective evaluation for sinus inflammation (nasal endoscopy, sinus CT), it was revealed that this approach overdiagnosed chronic sinusitis in about 50% of cases. 14 A recent clinical practice guideline recommends that the diagnosis of chronic sinusitis should be accompanied by objective evidence of paranasal sinus inflammation. This objective evidence can be obtained via radiologic studies or by rhinoscopy that shows purulent mucus, edema, or polyps in the middle meatus. 4 The added costs of radiography or nasal endoscopy are offset by the savings from a reduction in unnecessary treatment.

Traditionally, bacteria have been assumed to be the causative organisms in chronic sinusitis, and antibiotic therapy is commonly used to treat the disease. Microbiologic studies have demonstrated that the bacteriology of chronic sinusitis is different from acute bacterial sinusitis; in chronic sinusitis, anerobes and gram-negative organisms are frequently present. Polymicrobial involvement is common in chronic sinusitis, and the bacteriology changes in patients who have previously undergone sinus surgery. 10 Some bacteria in the paranasal sinuses may form biofilms that are refractory to eradication with standard antimicrobial therapy. However, chronic sinusitis is not necessarily an infectious disease, and microorganisms that colonize the nose and paranasal sinuses may stimulate inflammation without tissue invasion. 5 Recent attention has focused on the possible role that fungi or enterotoxin-producing staphylococci may play as extrinsic factors that trigger the inflammation observed in chronic sinusitis.

The differential diagnoses for CRS symptoms include allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, nasal septal deviation, and various other causes of headache and facial pain. Reliance on history alone has been shown to be an unreliable means to distinguish chronic sinusitis from these other possibilities. Routine anterior rhinoscopy is often insufficient because of poor visualization. Nasal endoscopy that demonstrates purulent drainage, polyps, or edema in the middle meatus or sphenoethmoidal recess is sufficient to make the diagnosis. In addition, endoscopy facilitates culture-directed antibiotic treatment because purulent exudates draining from the sinuses can be sampled with minimal morbidity. However, because endoscopic tools and training are not widely available in primary care settings, radiologic imaging is a primary diagnostic modality for chronic sinusitis.",

In addition, CT may identify anatomic abnormalities that are predisposing to sinus outflow tract obstruction. As a diagnostic modality, CT is not foolproof. Imaging may fail to detect small polyps and mucus recirculation phenomena. In addition, sinus abnormalities are frequently present despite a lack of chronic sinusitis symptoms. 15 Multiple studies have shown that the extent of CT abnormalities does not correlate with symptom burden. 16 CT is the best diagnostic tool for chronic sinusitis, but as with any diagnostic test the imaging findings must be correlated with the patient's history. A variety of other diagnostic tests may be used in select circumstances for patients with acute or chronic sinusitis including cystic fibrosis testing, allergy tests, and immunologic evaluation. However, a discussion of these testing modalities is outside of the scope of this article.",

For these individuals a symptom-based treatment approach is appropriate, and the history should be revisited in an attempt to identify the primary symptoms as well as aggravating and relieving factors for these symptoms. These patients can be difficult to treat, but positive treatment outcomes can result from an approach that educates patients about the physiologic basis for their symptoms and establishes a commitment to a patient search for beneficial measures. It is surprising how frequently patients will self-treat in an incorrect fashion (eg, taking antihistamines for facial pain.)
