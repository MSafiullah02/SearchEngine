            "text": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV from a universally fatal disease affl icting young people to a manageable chronic disease affecting and infecting older patients. Compared with the fi rst therapies for HIV developed in the early 1990s, more recent combination ART is less toxic, easier to administer, and more effective. However, the ideal timing of ART initiation remains controversial. It has been well established that patients with CD4+ T-cell counts < 200 cells/mm 3 benefi t from ART. More recent recommendations suggest that HIV-infected patients benefi t from ART initiation when CD4+ T-cell counts are less than 350 cells/mm 3 . Furthermore, untreated viremia in asymptomatic patients with CD4+ T-cell > 350 cells/mm 3 has been associated with progression of non-AIDSrelated comorbid medical conditions such as cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases [14] [15] [16] . In response these fi ndings, some experts advocate for ART initiation even when CD4+ T-cell counts are greater than 350 cells/mm [ 3, 17 ] . However, the timing of ART initiation requires goals specifi cally tailored to the individual patient.",

Older HIVinfected patients started on ART have faster viral suppression, potentially related to improved adherence compared with younger HIV-infected patients [ 18, 19 ] . Yet, despite better adherence and at least comparable if not superior viral suppression, older HIV-infected patients who initiate ART still have lower on-treatment CD4+ T-cell counts, delayed improvement in CD4+ T-cell counts, shorter time to development of AIDS, and higher mortality [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . One study showed that despite fewer AIDS-defi ning OIs in older patients (22% vs. 31% in younger patients, p < 0.01) and more rapid viral suppression, mortality was still signifi cantly higher in older HIVinfected patients (37% vs. 27% in younger patients, p = 0.04) [ 18 ] .",

One of the earliest immunologic impairments seen in HIV infection, similar to aging, is depletion of gut-associated lymphoid tissue, predominantly due to loss of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes of the effector memory type [ 39 ] . During the chronic phase of HIV infection, generalized immune activation occurs and ultimately, progressive decline in the na\u00efve and memory T-cell pool results in systemic CD4+ T-cell lymphocyte depletion [ 39, 40 ] . Aging, likewise, results in a decline in CD4+ T-cell counts [ 3, 41, 42 ] . Decreased na\u00efve T-cell reserve and thymic involution that occur in HIV-infected patients mirror changes associated with physiologic aging in an HIV-uninfected population [ 22, 25, 27, 43 ] .",

B-cell dysfunction can result in polyclonal activation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and lack of specifi c antibody responses. T-cell dysfunction can result in abnormal host responses to T-cell-dependent antigens. T-cells may also be abnormally activated in a resting state, and cytotoxic T-cell expansion and increased production of proinfl ammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon gamma can occur [ 3, 44, 45 ] . In both HIV and physiologic aging, there is evidence of T-cell senescence, the hallmarks of which include decreased expression of costimulatory receptors, shortened telomeres, impaired replication, and excessive cytokine production [ 3 ] . Accelerated T-cell Adapted from immune senescence in aging HIV-infected patients may be partially explained by persistent antigen stimulation [ 3 ] . Dysfunctional and declining immunity may lead to increased susceptibility to OIs normally associated with advanced HIV infection in aging patients who are not HIV infected [ 42 ] . These changes in immunity that occur in both HIV infection and physiologic aging contribute to impaired host defenses and resultant increased susceptibility to a wide range of bacterial and fungal infections [ 3 ] .",

Frailty is a clinical syndrome defi ned by the presence of at least three of the following factors: weight loss, low physical activity, exhaustion, weak grip strength, and slow walking time. HIV infection is associated with changes in the immune system that may contribute to development of frailty and accelerated progression to AIDS [ 29, 59, 61 ] . Frailty in HIV-infected patients has been increasingly recognized and may affect nearly 10% of patients evaluated in an outpatient setting [ 31, 52, 62 ] . Accelerated, progressive immune defi ciency may contribute to the frailty phenotype, independent of ART use [ 31, 52 ] . As in HIV-uninfected patients [63] [64] [65] , lower CD4+ T-cell counts are independently associated with frailty in HIV-infected patients, regardless of virologic response [ 31, 66 ] . In the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, frailty was equally prevalent in HIV-infected patients as in HIV-uninfected patients who were 10 years older, even in those with the shortest duration of HIV infection [ 52 ] (Table 12. 2 ). In addition to low CD4+ T-cell count, HIV-specifi c risk factors for frailty also include longer time since diagnosis of HIV and history of OIs [ 62, 66 ] , and frailty in HIV-infected patients increases with duration of HIV infection [ 52 ] . Prevalence of the frailty phenotype in HIV declines with ART [ 31 ] . As seen in HIV-uninfected patients, additional factors associated with greater likelihood of frailty among HIV-infected patients are a greater burden of comorbid disease and lower serum albumin [ 62 ] . Psychosocial risk factors for frailty in HIVinfected patients are higher depression severity scores, treatment with antidepressant medication and unemployed work status [ 62 ] . Frailty, in addition to more advanced HIV disease and greater comorbid disease, are risk factors for higher hospitalization rates [ 62 ] . Hospitalizations likely further contribute to progressive frailty. Future research is needed to identify modifi able risk factors for frailty and to minimize frailty in aging HIV-infected patients.",

In nonhuman primate models, low levels of Pneumocystis result in infl ammatory changes in the lung with resultant emphysematous changes [ 92, 93 ] . In human subjects found to be colonized with Pneumocystis , systemic infl ammatory mediators are elevated which may contribute to development of COPD and airway diseases [ 94 ] . In HIV-uninfected patients, latent viral infections have also been implicated in exacerbations of COPD [ 95 ] .

For example, ritonovir, a commonly prescribed protease inhibitor, suppresses the hepatic cytochrome p450 3A4 system (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 is responsible for degrading inhaled corticosteroids, particularly fl uticasone [ 103 ] . Concurrent use of ritonovir and nasal or inhaled corticosteroids could result in increased levels of circulating exogenous corticosteroid. Elevated serum corticosteroid levels may result in inhibition of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. Cushing syndrome and adrenal insuffi ciency have been reported in HIV-infected patients taking ritonovir and fl uticasone [104] [105] [106] . Future studies are needed to determine the optimal pulmonary regimen for HIV-infected patients with COPD.",

Systemically, treatment with ART decreases HIV replication, immune activation, chronic infl ammation and increases CD4+ T-cell lymphocyte counts. Within the alveolar space, ART similarly decreases pulmonary HIV viral load and decreases nonspecifi c pulmonary infl ammatory response [ 168, 169 ] . Infectious complications such as BP and PCP are less frequent among those on ART [ 13, 73, 112, 113, 115, 118, 123 ] . In an earlier study, the initiation of lamivudine was associated with improved dyspnea [ 69 ] . With less frequent and less severe infectious complications, risk of ILD -and other chronic lung diseases -may also be reduced with ART use. Indeed, a cohort study of 33,420 HIV-infected Veterans found that incident pulmonary disease was lower in patient already on ART at study enrollment [ 13 ] .",

Progression of diseases such as COPD may signifi cantly affect quality of life for HIV-infected patients. Cigarette smoking is a major contributor to pulmonary morbidity and mortality in the current ART era. In addition, recurrent respiratory tract infections are likely to contribute to pulmonary impairment in this population. It is important to identify mechanisms to preserve lung function and quality of life among HIV-infected patients. Between the shift of HIV to a chronic disease, the high prevalence of smoking and strong association between aging, smoking, and lung disease, future efforts need to focus on effective smoking cessation strategies specifi cally geared towards HIV-infected patients [ 170 ] . In addition to smoking cessation, safe and effective treatment of pulmonary diseases such as COPD, lung cancer, and PAH in aging HIV-infected patients on ART needs to be established. The role of ART in the development of pulmonary diseases must also be further investigated. Finally, as HIV-infected patients progress in age, the role of screening for chronic lung diseases such as COPD and lung cancer needs to be addressed.",
