The few existent datasets with information about the preferences of the researchers use implicit feedback. The lack of Recommender Systems in this particular field presents a challenge for the development of new recommendations models. In this work, we propose a Hybrid recommender model for recommending Chemical Compounds. The model integrates collaborative-filtering algorithms for implicit feedback (Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)) and semantic similarity between the Chemical Compounds in the ChEBI ontology (ONTO). We evaluated the model in an implicit dataset of Chemical Compounds, CheRM. The Hybrid model was able to improve the results of state-of-the-art collaborative-filtering algorithms, especially for Mean Reciprocal Rank, with an increase of 6.7% when comparing the collaborative-filtering ALS and the Hybrid ALS ONTO.",

We used offline methods [25] for evaluating the performance of the algorithms for the top@k, with k varying between 0 and 20, with steps of 1. From the vast range of metrics for evaluating recommender algorithms, we selected Classification Accuracy Metrics (CAMet) and Rank Accuracy Metrics (RAMet). CAMet measure the relevant and irrelevant items recommended in a ranked list. Examples of CAMet are Precision, Recall, and F-Measure. RAMet measure the ability of an algorithm for recommending the items in the correct order. Some well-known RAMet are Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain (nDCG), and Limited Area Under the Curve (lAUC), a variation of AUC [22] . All the selected metrics range between 0 and 1, and values closest to 1 are better. For the segmentation of the dataset, we used a cross-validation approach, by splitting users and items in 5 folds. Each iteration had 1/5 of the users and the items as test and 4/5 as train data. All the positive ratings in the test set are considered as relevant items. We considered the unrated items as negative ratings, i.e., not relevant for the users.",

One challenge in this field is the lack of available datasets with the preferences of the researchers about the Chemical Compounds for testing the RS. More recently, alternatives have emerged with the development of datasets consisting of data collected from implicit feedback.

The unrated set represents the items we want to rank to provide the best recommendations in the first positions to a user. The rated set are the items the users already rated. Since we will split the data into train and test, lets call train set to the rated set and test set to the unrated set. Both train and test sets are the input for CF and CB modules. Using CF algorithms for implicit feedback datasets, the CF module gives a score for each item in the test set. The CB module uses semantic similarity for providing a score for the items in the test set. In the last step, the scores from CF and CB modules are combined and sorted in descending order. For the CF module, we selected state-of-the-art CF recommender algorithms for implicit data 4 , ALS [8] and BPR [18] . ALS is a latent factor algorithm that addresses the confidence of a user-item pair rating. BPR is also a latent factor algorithm, but it is more appropriate for ranking a list of items. BPR does not just consider the unobserved user-item pairs as zeros, but instead, it takes into consideration the preference of a user between an observed and an unobserved rating.",

This module assigns a score S to each item in the test set, calculating the semantic similarity between each item in the train and the test sets, as shown in Fig. 2 . For calculating the similarity, we used DiShIn 5 [5] , a tool for calculating semantic similarities between the entities represented by an ontology. Semantic similarity allows measuring how close two entities are in a semantic base. When using ontologies, the semantic similarity may be measured, for example, by calculating the shortest path connecting the nodes of two entities. DiShin allows to calculate three similarity metrics: Resnik [19] , Lin [13] , and Jiang and Conrath [10] . For this work, we used the Lin metric. We intend to test the other metrics in the future. Whereas the CF module uses all the ratings from the train set to train the model, CB module only takes into account the ratings of each user. Using DiShin, we calculate the value of the similarity between each item in the train test and the items in test set.",

Nevertheless, in metrics such as Precision, Recall and F-measure, it follows the trend of the other algorithms, and when measuring these metric for the top@20, the results are similar. ONTO has the advantage of being a CB algorithm, therefore it does not have the problem of cold start for new items. ALS and BPR cannot be used if the item in the test set is not in the train set at least once (at least one author in the train set wrote about this Chemical Compound). Between ALS and BPR, ALS achieved the best results. Since BPR is an algorithm for ranking, it was expected to obtain better results. We believe this is due the fact that the dataset has a large number of ratings equal to one, and many items have the same relevance (difficult to rank).",
