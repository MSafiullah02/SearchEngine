While only the (S)-HPMP enantiomer 3 is active in the adenine series, its 3\u2032-O-phosphonomethyl regioisomer (iso-HPMPA)10 exhibits no antiviral activity.1a The approved adenine analogues PMEA (1) and PMPA (2) are primarily active against hepadna- and retroviruses, while PMEA (1) also exhibits notable activity against herpesviruses.5 Finally, FPMPA (4), which proved to be less antivirally effective, but also less toxic than PMEA (1), was thoroughly studied for its antiretroviral activity but was not pursued further to the clinical use.11\n",

Apparent incapability of the C-2\u2032 methyl group to substantially interact with the two polar amino acids of the HIV-1 RT led us to reason that replacement of the C-2\u2032 methyl with a polar group able to interact with Arg 72 and/or Gln 151 would increase the binding affinity of such an inhibitor to HIV-1 RT. Our docking studies indicated that replacement of the C-2\u2032 methyl group of tenofovir diphosphate (Fig. 2a) with a carboxyl group could, theoretically, lead to formation of up-to four new hydrogen bonds with arginine 72 and glutamine 151 (Fig. 2b).",

Thus, the N\n2-benzoylguanine derivative 8i\n18b was prepared in 49% yield from compound 8g in pyridine by sequential treatment with Me3SiCl, BzCl, water and aqueous ammonia (Scheme 3\n). Subsequent oxidation of the benzoyl derivative 8i with TEMPO/NaClO2/NaClO afforded the carboxy analogue 9i in 78% yield (Table 2, entry 9). Direct deprotection of the phosphonate moiety of compound 9i using Me3SiBr in acetonitrile28 afforded the N\n2-benzoylguanine derivative 7i in 52% yield (Table 2, entry 9, Scheme 3). In order to obtain CPMEG (7g), the benzoyl group of derivative 9i was removed first, using MeONa solution, followed by the removal of the isopropyl groups from the intermediate 9g (Scheme 3).",

One of the obvious reasons for the lack of the biological properties of the CPME derivatives 7 may be their poor bioavailability caused by their high polarity (CPME derivatives are even more polar that the corresponding PME, PMP and HPMP analogues). Since the majority of the therapeutically successful ANPs have to be administered in the form of their prodrugs, the preparation of various prodrugs of the lead (S)-CPMEA (7a) is currently in progress and will be reported elsewhere.",

Concentrated HCl (eight drops) was added to \u223cpH 2.5. The heterogenous mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 72 h. The solid was removed by filtration of the reaction mixture through a silica gel layer and washed with methanol. The solvents were evaporated and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (CHCl3/MeOH/AcOH, 88:6:6). The purification was repeated two more times to remove colourful by-products and inorganic salts. The desired product 9a (253 mg, 63%) was obtained as a yellowish oil, which upon standing in EtOAc/MeOH mixture crystallized.",
