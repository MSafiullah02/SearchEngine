            "text": "To minimize the risk of non\u2010specific staining in immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) of tissue sections, we used two independent antibodies raised against different domains of the HAT protein. As illustrated in Figure 1A, the Ab1 antibody was raised against the serine protease (SP) domain, whereas the Ab2 antibody was raised against the stem region containing the SEA domain. The specificity of the two antibodies was tested in HEK293T and HeLa cells transfected with full\u2010length human HAT cDNA. Western blot analysis under non\u2010reducing conditions revealed a single band at the predicted molecular weight (46 kDa) (Yamaoka et al., 1998) with both antibodies in whole cell lysates from transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B, left panels) and transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 1B, middle panel and data not shown). Since members of the HAT/DESC family display high homology, HEK293T, and HeLa cells transfected with V5\u2010tagged full\u2010length human HATL5 were included in the western blot analysis. None of the HAT antibodies showed cross\u2010reactivity with HATL5 in HEK293T or HeLa cells (Fig. 1B, middle panel and data not shown). The presence of HATL5 protein in the lysates was confirmed using an anti\u2010V5 antibody (Fig. 1B, right panel). Further analysis of whole cell lysates under reducing conditions was performed (Fig. 1C). TTSP's are synthesized as inactive zymogens that are activated by cleavage at a conserved activation site motif (predicted to be between Arg186\u2010Ile187 in HAT, indicated with an arrow in Fig. 1A). Upon activation, the catalytic domain remains tethered via a disulfide bond to the stem region of the protease. Therefore, the cleaved, active SP\u2010domain can be visualized by SDS\u2010PAGE and western blotting under reducing conditions using Ab1. As displayed in Figure 1C, the full\u2010length form of HAT was detected in addition to a \u223c27 kDa form corresponding to the HAT SP\u2010domain (Yasuoka et al., 1997) which was visible in both HEK293T and HeLa cells (left panels). Again, no cross\u2010reactivity with HATL5 was detected. The V5 antibody readily detected HATL5 protein as expected (right panel). In conditioned media from HeLa cells (Fig. 1 D) and HEK293T cells (not shown), HAT was only detected as the 27 kDa form indicating that the majority of shed HAT is present in its active form.",

            "text": "The TTSPs matriptase and TMPRSS13 play critical roles in terminal differentiation of squamous epithelia leading to the establishment of a functional barrier in the epidermis and oral cavity (List et al., 2002, 2003; Madsen et al., 2014). Interestingly, HAT mRNA is also expressed in several tissues containing squamous epithelia including skin, oral cavity, cervix, and esophagus (Sales et al., 2011). This prompted us to examine the distribution and cellular localization of HAT protein in squamous epithelia by IHC. The two independent anti\u2010HAT rabbit antibodies raised against different HAT peptide antigens (Ab1 and Ab2) verified above were used to minimize the risk of non\u2010specific staining. Using serial sections, slides were probed with primary antibodies or used as negative controls where the primary antibody was substituted with non\u2010immune rabbit IgG (Fig. 2D, G and data not shown). Representative sections of normal esophageal and cervical mucosa are shown in Figure 2. Careful inspection of staining patterns on serial sections revealed that the two anti\u2010HAT antibodies displayed very similar staining pattern of the tissues examined (Fig. 2 A, B, E, F). In both the cervix and the esophagus, a strong epithelial staining was detected in the apical squamous cells with no significant staining in the submucosal or mesenchymal compartments. HAT protein is primarily localized on the cell surface of the larger squamous cells (Fig. 2C) and no nuclear staining was observed. This cell surface localization is in agreement with the expected distribution of the predicted membrane anchored topology of HAT. No significant staining was detected in the basal layer. The basal layers harbor the highly mitotic cells in in squamous epithelia (Huang et al., 2005; Looi et al., 2008). Sections from liver (Fig. 2H, I), thyroid (Fig. 2J) and brain (Fig.2 K), which have previously been shown to express no detectable HAT message by RT\u2010PCR and Northern blot analysis (Yamaoka et al., 1998; Sales et al., 2011), were included as negative controls. The insert in Fig. 2K demonstrates HAT staining in bronchial epithelium as previously reported (Bertram et al., 2011). Taken together, these data demonstrate that endogenous HAT protein displays a pericellular localization in differentiating epithelial cells in stratified squamous epithelia.",

In order to gather a better understanding of the extent and localization of HAT protein expression in normal and cancerous tissue, we performed IHC using human tissue arrays composed of samples that varied in degree of pathogenicity from normal to poorly differentiated (Grade III) squamous cell carcinoma. Characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma progression include the presence of small and abnormally shaped cells with a loss of squamous appearance and a distinguishable basal membrane. Normal esophageal and cervical HAT protein expression was compared to squamous cell carcinoma of increasing grades using IHC analysis.",

In poorly differentiated cervical carcinoma (Grade III), expression of HAT protease was largely absent, demonstrated by exceedingly weak or altogether absent cellular membrane and cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 3F). None of the samples displayed nuclear staining. In control samples where HAT antibody was replaced with non\u2010immune rabbit IgG, staining could not be detected. Statistical analysis and comparison revealed a significant decrease in staining intensity in each of the two groups of cancer tissues Grade I\u2013II (P < 0.003), and Grade III (0.00001), respectively, when compared to normal tissue (Fig. 4A).",

            "text": "As part of an ongoing effort to determine the expression and function of the TTSP family in cancer, we performed expression analysis of HAT in healthy cervical and esophageal epithelia and in corresponding epithelia during squamous cell carcinogenesis. The specificity of the two HAT antibodies used in this study was verified by western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of HAT protein expression in human tissue arrays showed that the protease was consistently expressed in the suprabasal and apical layers harboring the most differentiated epithelial cells in healthy epithelia. The staining pattern in normal esophagus was consistent with that observed by Uhl\u00e9n et al. (2015). Furthermore, HAT was mostly confined to the surface membrane of epithelial cells, consistent with the predicted localization of the type II transmembrane serine protease. Importantly, in squamous cell carcinomas of the same tissues, a significantly decreased expression and, in many cases, a complete loss of HAT was observed in advanced cancer. The localization of HAT protein in normal stratified squamous epithelia and the subsequent loss of the protease during carcinogenesis provide valuable information regarding the function of the protease in normal epithelial biology and carcinogenesis. In stratified squamous epithelia, a balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and death must be carefully regulated in order to maintain their function. The stratified squamous epithelium acts as an effective barrier between the outside environments contaminants, including toxins and pathogens. The cells of these epithelia replicate frequently to replace damaged or dead cells. The proliferating epithelial cells reside in the basal layer and cells continuously pass through a complex differentiation program to generate basolateral and apical cells that are finally sloughed off (desquamation) at the surface of the epithelium. It has been demonstrated that extracellular proteases are involved in the acquisition of functional stratified squamous epithelia. Thus, the TTSPs, matriptase and TMPRSS13, are critical for terminal differentiation and proper function in the epidermis and oral epithelium (List et al., 2002, 2003; Madsen et al., 2014). Considering the finding that HAT is expressed in the non\u2010proliferating suprabasal/apical layers combined with the observation that HAT is lost during the dedifferentiation of epithelial cells in high grade tumors, a hallmark of squamous cell carcinogenesis, an interesting question to explore further is whether the observed link between loss of HAT protein and squamous cell carcinoma progression is correlational or causal. A recent study demonstrated that HAT deficient mice did not display any overt phenotypes in the absence of external challenges or additional genetic deficits (Sales et al., 2011). However, it remains to be experimentally tested whether these mice have an altered susceptibility if subjected to e.g. chemical genotoxic stress or transgenic oncogene expression. Currently, the candidate endogenous mammalian proteolytic substrates identified for HAT include the urokinase receptor (uPAR), and the protease activated receptor (PAR) 2 (Iwakiri et al., 2004; Chokki et al., 2005; Matsushima et al., 2006; Beaufort et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2013). In addition, HAT has fibrinolytic activity and it has been hypothesized that HAT may participate in fibrinolysis within the airway mucous membranes, by cleaving fibrinogen transported from the blood stream (Yoshinaga et al., 1998). Interestingly, two other HAT/DESC subfamily members, DESC1 and HATL5 display similar expression patterns in normal stratified squamous epithelium and a gradual loss during carcinogenesis. Thus, DESC1 expression correlates with normal keratinocyte differentiation and inversely with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression (Lang and Schuller, 2001; Sedghizadeh et al., 2006). We have previously shown that HATL5 is significantly decreased in cervical, esophageal, and head and neck carcinomas as compared to normal tissue (Miller et al., 2014). An important finding in this connection is that cellular HAT is present in both its zymogen form and in its cleaved and active form and that shed HAT is present mainly in its active form upon transfection of full\u2010length HAT cDNA in mammalian cells. Interestingly, the active forms of DESC1 or HATL5 were not detected in similar experiments (Hobson et al., 2004, Miller et al., 2014). Therefore it can be speculated that HAT acts as an activator and initiator of a proteolytic cascade during terminal differentiation of squamous epithelia similar to the proteolytic cascade of tissue kallikreins in the stratum corneum of the epidermis (Brattsand et al., 2005).",
