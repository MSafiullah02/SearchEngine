The IHR (2005) also obligates every member state of the WHO to build national core competency for disease surveillance. However, the regulations do not prescribe exactly how nations are to meet this core capacity. Certain low- and middle-income countries\u2014particularly those facing the need to rapidly strengthen disease surveillance and overall public health infrastructure to meet their IHR (2005) obligations\u2014may be looking to syndromic surveillance options and opportunities. A report from the IHR (2005) negotiations stresses this point: \u201cBecause areas with the highest needs for surveillance of communicable diseases have often the poorest surveillance systems, new surveillance approaches, such as the surveillance of syndromes, adapted to poor laboratory infrastructure should be developed to respond to the challenge of development gaps\u201d [3].",

            "text": "Since syndromic surveillance systems began being used in the 1990s and became widespread in early 2000, vast applications of these systems have demonstrated many capabilities and uses. There are numerous variations among syndromic surveillance system definitions, objectives, and surveillance methodologies, which is why there is a need for a comprehensive characterization of the breadth of the term \u201csyndromic surveillance.\u201d Common themes across the literature have emerged, suggesting general agreement among those in the field. The commonly accepted principles of syndromic surveillance include:\u2022\nEarly detection and response: Most articles on syndromic surveillance discuss the value of these systems in signaling the presence of an abnormal trend with \u201csufficient probability\u201d to warrant further investigation (without necessarily providing definitive detection) [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20].\u2022\nUse of \u201ccontinuously acquired\u201d pre-diagnostic information: By focusing on data collected prior to clinical diagnosis or laboratory confirmation, syndromic surveillance uses non-traditional health indicator data [17], [21], [22].\u2022\nPossible situational awareness use: Chretien and his co-authors describe situational awareness as \u201cmonitoring the effectiveness of epidemic responses and characterizing affected populations\u201d [12]. By providing a tool for following the course of an outbreak, syndromic surveillance has value besides merely initial detection in augmenting public health surveillance as well as outbreak response [6], [11], [15], [23], [24], [25].\u2022\nProviding reassurance that an outbreak is not actually occurring: By monitoring outbreak thresholds, as well as collecting data from a variety of sources, a syndromic surveillance system can provide information to public health authorities confirming or refuting the occurrence of an outbreak [17], [19], [24], [26].\u2022\nAugments traditional public health surveillance: In order to improve outbreak detection [13], [17], [19], several definitions of syndromic surveillance emphasize that its goal is to \u201cenhance, rather than replace, traditional approaches to epidemic detection\u201d [14].\n",

Second, some refer to the term \u201csyndrome\u201d as a specific, clinically defined phenomenon, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and others use it more loosely and non-specifically as simply a group of symptoms [28].",

Problematically, these terms overlap, contradict, or are inconsistently applied, maintaining the terminological confusion. Further, several terms frequently applied to syndromic surveillance are not adequately descriptive to convey the type of system being referred to or do not distinguish between types of systems, and thus may not be appropriate as general, overarching terms.

Thus, there is now an even greater need for a consensus about what syndromic surveillance means. Additionally, as plans to translate syndromic surveillance systems to lower resource settings proceed, a proper conceptualization of the systems could increase their acceptance and efficient use. The development and communication of a unified understanding of the field may encourage governments or localities to adopt, invest in, and implement syndromic surveillance, where appropriate, and thus enhance compliance with IHR (2005); this adoption in middle- and low-income nations is being explored in the ongoing work to identify exemplary case studies of successful utilization of syndromic surveillance [30].

The following year, an article based on recommendations from a CDC Working Group contrasted surveillance of a syndrome that \u201cis relatively specific for the condition of interest\u201d (such as acute flaccid paralysis as \u201ca syndromic marker\u201d in the detection of poliomyelitis) to surveillance with a broader purpose, such as \u201csexually transmitted disease detection and control\u201d [35]. More recently, Fricker differentiates \u201cwell-defined\u201d data that are \u201clinked to specific types of outbreaks\u201d to data that are \u201cvaguely defined and perhaps only weakly linked to specific types of outbreaks, such as over-the-counter sales of cough and cold medication or absenteeism rates\u201d [43].",
