LRTI on the contrary, which involves the bronchi, bronchiole and the lung tissue, is considered a more severe disease that should be seen by a paediatrician.

Examples are: The Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument, based on wheezing and retractions [9], the (Bedside) Paediatric Early Warning Sign Scores [10], [11], [12], the Preschool Respiratory Assessment Measure, [13] the clinical scoring system described by Kristjansson [14], the Silverman-Anderson Respiratory Scale [15] and the disease severity score by Gern [16].

Conventional endpoint single-target PCRs were able to report positive and negative results of RNA and DNA viruses. Later on, computerized quantitative RT-PCRs were able to correlate the amount of PCR product to a viral load. Testing a panel of respiratory viruses within a time span of 6 to 24 hours has become routine practice in many hospitals. In paediatric populations, the sensitivity has shown to be higher than for viral culture [25]. Nowadays, qualitative and even quantitative multiplex PCRs are able to detect multiple respiratory viruses in one single sample simultaneously, however sensitivity in a multiplex PCR is generally lower than in single target RT-PCR [33]. A disadvantage of commercially available multiplex PCRs is that the tests require external controls, which are difficult to perform since not all available platforms publish their targets [34]. Despite the availability of commercially quantitative multiplex PCRs, in-house quantitative single target RT-PCRs are used more frequently in current laboratory practice.",

            "text": "Introducing highly sensitive viral diagnostics has yielded a broad spectrum of viral diagnoses, but has not automatically lead to changes in patient management. In an adult population, implementation of RT-PCR in LRTI increased the diagnostic yield, but did not reduce antibiotic use or costs [35]. In a multicentre paediatric study, interviewing medical doctors on fictitious ARI cases, RT-PCR decreased antibiotic use. However, in real life, the same physicians did not alter their antibiotic prescriptions based on the results of RT-PCR [36]. In a Cochrane review (4 RCT's) that evaluated the impact of rapid viral tests in children with ARI in an emergency department (ED), rapid viral testing by immunofluorescence or PCR did not lead to changes in antibiotic use, length of ED visits, blood or urine testing, but did lower the rates of chest radiographs. The authors stated that routine viral testing in the ED is promising as a means to reduce antibiotic use, but there is yet insufficient evidence to support this. Large trials are needed with a focus on patient management with respect to the results [6]. In a recent retrospective study evaluating clinical differences between RSV and non-RSV patients, virological testing (enzyme linked immunoassay and / or PCR) did not help in management decisions and seemed insufficient to predict outcome at an individual level [37]. In another recent retrospective study of 177 children with ARI in a general hospital, antibiotic management was not influenced after detecting a viral respiratory pathogen, although the authors state that routine testing of common respiratory pathogens could lead to a better understanding of their role in disease in children with respiratory symptoms [38]. In a 6-year prospective study of children with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), designed to describe the frequency of respiratory viruses, antibiotics were prescribed less frequently in viral positive versus negative children, but only when they were > 18 months old [39]. Our own data from a multicentre prospective controlled clinical trial of 582 previously healthy children with respiratory symptoms showed a high diagnostic yield of RT-PCR, however the rapid communication (within 24 hours) of results to the paediatrician did not change patient care versus those who received results later [40]. These findings underlie the statement of the AAP, not to recommend routine viral testing for standard ARI cases, unless the physician is willing to change his patient management based on the results [20].",

Data suggest that RSV has the greatest disease burden both in hospitalized children and in outpatients, especially in children under five years of age [41]. Furthermore, Human Rhinovirus (HRV) is generally associated with the common cold, can cause severe ARI as well and is the most common pathogen in ARI in young children [42], [43]. Re-infections with HRV are commonly observed, and are usually caused by different virus strains. [44] As reviewed by Kim, recent studies suggest that HRV subtype C may be more virulent than other HRV [45], but not all RT-PCRs are capable of distinguishing between the different HRV strains. Influenza virus (IV) is well known for its seasonal outbreaks of ARI during a few weeks in winter, and also for a sepsis like syndrome without respiratory symptoms. Human adenovirus (HAdV) is common in respiratory disease with a severe disease course in children with underlying immunodeficiency [46]. Para-influenza viruses (PIV) subtypes 1 and 2 are known to cause croup and subtype 3 is known to cause bronchiolitis and pneumomia [47]. PIV subtype 4 is has been reported to be a much less frequent cause of ARI [48]. The incidence of polyomaviruses WU [49] and KI [50] is low and their clinical relevance remain unclear and require further evaluation [51].",

Several circumstances can generate positive RT-PCR results. RT-PCR assays are very sensitive and can detect small amounts of viral nucleic acids, which are still present during a convalescence period. For each individual virus it is not known how long DNA/RNA shedding may continue during this convalescence period [68], [69]. Furthermore, children with a normal immune system can asymptomatically harbor viruses in their respiratory tract. Usually, a primary viral infection leads to an adaptive immune response with induction of memory T-cells, so that a second hit with the same virus usually results in less serious or even absent symptoms [70].",

RT-PCR has shown to be a useful tool for epidemiologic studies. However, the epidemiology of many nosocomial respiratory infections is not well known. For RSV, the incidence of nosocomial spread seems low. Although information about management of outbreaks is sparse and not well studied, normal prevention measurements appear to be rational [83]. For cohorting, rapid testing for RSV has shown to be a safe, cost-effective and efficient way to improve bed management [84]. Although we do not doubt that isolation as strategy helps to prevent nosocomial infections, we still have concerns when cohorting is based on RT-PCR results of only a limited number of viruses. Mixed infections occur in a substantial proportion of children and whether these children spread other non-detected viruses during cohorting is not yet clear. Rapid antigen tests like DFA are limited useful for cohorting issues, since they may have a high proportion of false negatives. RT-PCR obviously is much more sensitive and specific, but the turnaround time is not sufficient to act in time for infection control measurements at admission. Theoretically, one would expect that RT-PCR would be beneficial for infection control, however no large study has demonstrated a positive effect to date. The risk of cross-infection in children sharing a room was studied recently in a prospective observational cohort study of 48 children with bronchiolitis. Room sharing between RSV-positive and RSV-negative children on the first day of admission did not influence the risk of co-infection [85].",
