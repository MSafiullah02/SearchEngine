This was the catalyst that led to President George W Bush to announce the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza at a highlevel Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2005. The goals of the partnership were to improve global readiness by elevating the issue on national agendas, leveraging resources, and building capacity to identify, contain and respond to pandemic influenza. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, subsequently announced that the UN family would do all it could to ensure all countries-rich and poor-were protected and prepared for a pandemic caused by avian influenza, and appointed a UN Systems Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza (UNSIC). This proved to be a major leap forward in advancing One Health through bringing about collaboration between international organizations, regions and nations to discuss the ongoing pandemic threat posed by HPAI H5N1, and provided an excellent example of what can be done when specifically targeting collaborations between leaders in order to bring about change and action. This collaboration brought together international organizations, including FAO, WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and the EU, with various country representatives, and was the force behind the development of the International Ministerial Conferences on Avian and Pandemic Influenza (IMCAPI). IMCAPI have clearly been major drivers of OH over the past decade, and may provide a blueprint for future directions and leadership of OH. The early conferences were concerned with pledging of funds and resources for an international preparedness and response effort, but subsequent IMCAPI have considered the wider impact and cause of EIDs. In 2008, the four international organizations (FAO, OIE, WHO and UNICEF), together with the World Bank and UNSIC, collaborated on developing strategies primarily focused on influenza yet clearly intended to extend to the wider context of disease emergence. The strategies were outlined in a document entitled 'Contributing to One World, One Health. A Strategic Framework for Reducing Risks of Infectious Diseases at the Animal-Human-Ecosystems Interface' which focused on how best to diminish the risk and minimize the global impact of epidemics and pandemics due to EID by enhancing disease intelligence, surveillance and emergency response systems at national, regional and international levels, and by supporting them through strong and stable public and animal health services and effective national communication strategies (UNSIC 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2816, "end": 2828, "text": "(UNSIC 2008)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concerns About Pandemic Risks from Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza"}, {"text": "The IMCAPI meeting in Hanoi in 2010 concluded with the Hanoi Declaration which proposed a multi-sector array of national measures to detect new diseases that may cross from animals to humans.

The specific aim of the meeting was to identify clear and concrete actions to move the concept of OH from vision to implementation. Seven working groups were identified as being crucial steps in attaining the 3-5 year vision. These were: (1) 'Training' to develop and build skills, expertise and competencies through a OH curriculum; (2) a 'One Health Global Network' as a means of gaining international support and as a vehicle to stimulate further global collaboration; (3) an 'Information Clearing House' to promote advocacy through providing information on success stories and lessons learned; (4) 'Needs Assessment', by developing country-level self-assessment methods to identify activities which could benefit from a OH approach; (5) 'Capacity Building', by identifying ways to leverage existing programs and capacity-building efforts to have a major impact at minimal cost; (6) 'Proof of Concept', through demonstrating a retrospective and prospective evidence base that the use of OH interventions and/or concepts leads to better cross-species health outcomes; and (7) a 'Business Plan', by articulating the concept of and rationale for OH more clearly and presenting this information to policymakers and donors worldwide (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010).
