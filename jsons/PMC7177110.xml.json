It is the virus responsible for causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a type of lower respiratory tract infection with the potential to cause severe and possibly fatal atypical novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)- infected pneumonia (NCIP) in humans.",

Management guideline was sectioned into various levels both therapeutic and non-therapeutic managements types with priority emphasized on preventive measures such as strict hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, case isolation at home, voluntary home quarantine, social distancing for those above 70 years and the entire population, closure of schools and universities and personal protective equipment. Surgical and Intensive care unit escalation, operative management involving first double lung transplant successfully performed by Dr. Chen Jinguy et al of the Wuxi People\u2019s Hospital utilizing ECMO and invasive mechanical ventilation, and medical therapies such as antiviral, corticosteroids, oncological drugs and immunity enhancing therapy proved very effective.",

The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths continues to rise. The current reported mortality for COVID-19 is approximately 3.41 % compared to 10 % for SARS and 35% for MERS. The mortality rate was higher than 3.41% in US and Italy, lower in Japan, Iran, and Republic of Korea. Critically considering the aggressive spread of COVID-19, it is still too early to assess the mortality. All countries should respond attentively and effectively to the epidemic. Approximately 20-50% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients develop lower acute respiratory distress syndrome and required ICU care with evidence of high risk group been the older age group with co-morbidity posing risk for poor outcome.",

Due to the limitation on pathological findings of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is becoming a global concern. Autopsies are warranted and valuable for futuristic study and research.Although at the moment there is no specific treatment for COVID-19. The best strategy to deal with SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is to strictly implement controlling source of infection, protecting the susceptible people more especially the highly susceptible (the aged), wearing protective equipment, and cutting off the transmission. The global governing bodies in various countries must encourage people to stay at home; cancel or postpone public events or mass gatherings; shut down public institutions and public events. These control measures when effectively and accurately implemented, will control the epidemic effectively. Futuristic research and study will gear focus more on improving accuracy and precision in early diagnostic tests, developing vaccines and identifying effective drugs. Therefore elucidating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is imperative for achieving such goals.",
