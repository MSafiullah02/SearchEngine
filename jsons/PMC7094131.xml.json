Hematocrit decreased gradually over 4 days of support (day 0, 27.2% \u00b1 16.6%; day 4, 10.7% \u00b1 2.3%) due to repeated blood sampling from both recipient swine and the extracorporeal circuit, and from minor transient bleeding from repeated lung tissue sampling. The inflammatory response of recipient swine was evaluated by quantification of serum inflammatory cytokine levels. From baseline to day 4, mean serum concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), interleukin (IL) 1\u03b2, Il-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) variably increased, with the largest increases in IL-1\u03b2 (10.4-fold), IFN\u03b3 (19.2-fold), and IL-1ra (69-fold). Mean serum concentrations of IL-1\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-18 decreased, with the largest decrease in IL-8 (14.8-fold) (Table E2). All serum cytokine concentrations after 4 days of normothermic support were within or below ranges reported in swine EVLP studies that provided a maximum of 12 hours of support (Table E3).",

Polymorphonuclear cells, indicators of immune response to injury, remained low in airways but gradually increased in alveoli. Alveolar and interstitial edema increased slightly, which was consistent with the observed increase in lung weight. Nevertheless, the lack of significant increase in any lung injury category score from baseline to day 4 suggests that the extracorporeal lungs experienced minimal to no injury over 4 days of normothermic support.",

Although such a study size limits the opportunity for statistical analyses, the results demonstrated feasibility of normothermic support of extracorporeal lungs for 4 days. Future studies will investigate larger numbers of lungs, recipient swine, and a wider variety of experimental conditions including increased flow rates, recovery of damaged lungs, and therapeutic interventions. Further, because immunosuppression was used, immunological markers of injury may be different than in the absence of immunosuppression, which may account for differences observed between cytokine concentrations in BAL fluid and serum. Notably, several of the cytokines investigated in this study have been shown to have both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles,25, 26, 27 so their functions in this system are difficult to interpret. Future studies using a multiday extracorporeal support system could help elucidate the roles of cytokines in extracorporeal lung support systems. Several technical challenges remain to be resolved in the current system: specification and regulation of a long-term extracorporeal organ environment, controlled variability of extracorporeal organ orientation, and appropriate ventilation and perfusion management strategies. The inability to strictly regulate dynamic hydrostatic pressure changes led to the development of edema, necessitating future development of feedback-regulated pump controls and an automated organ height adjustment system capable of responding precisely in real time to dynamic changes in swine position, transpulmonary pressure gradient, and lung weight. Although this study did not investigate deposition of recipient cells or platelets in extracorporeal lungs, which could result in platelet-induced injury and chimerism, future studies of hematologic and immunologic interactions will be critical to assess the safety of clinical translation.",

The use of XC to recover damaged lungs ex situ could be applicable in clinical settings where patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation fail to match suitable donor lungs. In such patients, XC of lungs with reversible injuries for several days could enable functional assessment, lung-protective strategies, and graft recovery while avoiding the physiologic insult associated with major surgical intervention and severe primary graft dysfunction. Lungs recovered by XC would then be transplanted into the patient, thereby potentially decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with transplantation of injured lungs. Future investigations using multiday extracorporeal organ support could also enable advanced interventions through immunomodulation,28\n,\n29 cell replacement,17\n,\n30, 31, 32, 33 or other bioengineering approaches,17\n,\n32\n,\n34, 35, 36 and ultimately serve as a platform to improve transplant outcomes.",
