There are three base operators in China with a known proportion of subscriber distribution, [3] and assuming a consistent incidence of Wuhan roaming, the results of using Wuhan roaming data from one operator alone, or from all operators, would not affect the linear regression model's estimate of the expected number of incidences.

As can be seen from Figure 3 and Figure 4 , the list of cities that exceeded the expected number of cases in the first phase (DAY 1 -DAY 10, 10 days) changed daily, and the incidence curve was highly volatile and chaotic, with a faster increase in the cumulative incidence curve and more dramatic changes in the outbreak. In the second phase (DAY 11 -DAY 15, 5 days), the cities that exceeded the expected number of cases were fixed in 8 cities, including Zhengzhou, Nanyang, Zhumadian, Shangqiu, Pingdingshan, Anyang, Xinxiang, and Xuchang (cities code: 16, 8, 18, 12, 9, 1, 13, and 15). The incidence curve showed that it entered the combing phase, the elevation angle of the cumulative incidence curve was downwardly pressed, and the level of incidence was generally suppressed, showing a certain relief. After 10 days of strict intervention, the epidemic was effectively suppressed, after which it entered the combing phase five days later and, after minor .

The science and effectiveness of strict control measures during emergency periods were also supported by other research theories and practical evidence. [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] At present, relying on factors of temperature and vaccines to control the COVID-19 epidemic will also face many uncertainties, including viral variation, [52] and indecision and oscillation between different vaccination policies may miss the boat and have profound implications for other countries or regions. Different countries or regions may face different levels of epidemics, and their respective processes of passing through the emergency period into the normalized prevention and control period will not be synchronized. It is wise to take active and stringent control measures to intervene in the epidemic according to their own conditions, to quickly pass the emergency period of the epidemic, and to avoid fighting a protracted war during the emergency period.",
