While most antiviral therapies have virus-encoded targets, targeting host factors may be an attractive option since they are not affected by mutations occurring in the viral genome [1]. Thus, emergence of resistance might be less of a problem compared to virus-encoded targets. However, sequence variation also exists in host factors mostly in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In some cases host genetic variants strongly influence viral infection, disease progression or response to antiviral therapy [2, 3, 4].",

Replication of an impressive number of diverse viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) influenza, coronaviruses, tombus virus, human cytomegalovirus and West Nile virus has been shown to be regulated by or in some way dependent on CypA [6\u2022\u2022, 7]. In case of HCV it has been well established that viral replication depends on CypA and that the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA) that targets CypA is a potent inhibitor of HCV replication [8, 9]. Alisporivir, a derivative of CsA devoid of the mother compound's immunosuppressive effects, potently blocks HCV replication in vitro and in vivo and has reached phase III clinical testing for patients with chronic HCV [10].",

Further studies suggested that the reason for this HCV-resistance phenotype is that the SNP's result in a destabilization of the CypA protein and its rapid degradation [13\u2022, 14]. Since all variants are very rare it is unclear whether individuals that are homozygous for any of them exist and if so whether they would be resistant to HCV infection. Of note, in mice CypA knockouts are viable suggesting that the mammalian host can compensate loss of CypA while HCV cannot [14]. In addition to HCV, also human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 and -229E use CypA as an essential host factor and the CypA mutations D66E, G96D and N106I did not support HCoV-229E replication [15, 16]. Since these three coding SNP's result in rapid degradation and a CypA depleted cellular environment it is very likely that also other viruses which use CypA as a host factor will also be adversely affected by these variants. However, until now there are no further publications on this topic.",
