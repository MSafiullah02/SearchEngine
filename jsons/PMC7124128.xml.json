Meanwhile, in our previous study [3], higher D-dimer and PT on admission were associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Hence these three coagulation parameters D-dimer, PT and platelet count were included in this study and the results were recorded at the time the patients meeting the definition of severe COVID or non-COVID. As an indirect marker of coagulation activation, whether patients with elevated D-dimer could benefit from anticoagulant treatment was evaluated. Anticoagulant treatment was defined as receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for 7 days or longer [8], which was the most commonly used anticoagulant therapy for severe pneumonia in our hospital.",

However, the effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy for sepsis-associated DIC is still controversial [14, 15] our study also suggests that anticoagulant may not benefit to the unselected patients whether in COVID or non-COVID group. Although it has been confirmed that markedly elevated D-dimer was associated with poor prognosis in severe pneumonia [3, 5], only COVID group with elevated D-dimer (> 6 ULN) could benefit from heparin treatment in our study, this might due to the more obvious hypercoagulability in COVID group, and heterogeneity of coagulation status induced by various pathogens in non-COVID group.",
