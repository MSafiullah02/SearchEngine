            "text": "Counting these events for different scenarios and choosing the one with the minimum number of events seems to be a straightforward task. However, realization of this goal meets with hurdles at several levels. First, in order to derive the patterns of presence\u2010absence of a gene in a set of lineages (phyletic pattern), which are used as the input for the reconstruction methods, it is necessary to robustly identify orthologous genes, that is, genes that evolved from a single ancestor gene in the common ancestor of the compared species.\n13\n, \n14\n Identification of orthologs is a nontrivial task for relatively fast\u2010evolving genes from distant species and, especially, for any genes with a history of multiple duplications and losses. Second, and more fundamentally, reliable reconstruction of the course of evolution and of the ancestral gene sets is hampered by the uncertainty associated with the relative probabilities or rates of different events, in particular, gene loss versus horizontal gene transfer. Third, even phyletic patterns based on reliably delineated sets of orthologs hardly contain all the information that is required for the evolutionary reconstruction. In principle, even a gene that is found in all modern cellular life forms might not be inherited from LUCA: its ubiquity could instead result from an HGT sweep. Fourth, reconstruction methods based on parsimony are inherently limited as they have no capability to identify ancestral genes that have been lost in all or all but one of the extant lineages. Thus, the estimates of the gene content of ancestral forms are conservative, and the extent of underestimate is uncertain. Finally, to generate evolutionary scenarios, the parsimony reconstructions rely on a particular topology of the \u201ctree of life.\u201d Even apart from the major uncertainties that are inherent in deep phylogenetic trees, any such tree at best reflects the history of a small fraction of highly conserved genes: figuratively speaking, it is \u201ca tree of one percent.\u201d\n15\n Worse yet, the very adequacy of the \u201ctree of life\u201d concept is questionable considering the extensive HGT that is part and parcel of the evolution of prokaryotes.\n16\n, \n17\n A more adequate probabilistic framework, such as that provided by maximum likelihood models, is required to produce more realistic estimates, but such models can be prohibitively complex, and the approach to parameter estimation is unclear. Neither is it clear how the reconstruction can be performed in a tree\u2010independent fashion.",

These proteins fail to make it into the reconstructed gene repertoire of LUCA because the respective processes in bacteria, on the one hand, and archaea on the other hand are catalyzed by distinct, unrelated enzymes and, in the case of membrane phospholipids, yield chemically distinct membranes (the archaeal membrane phospholipids are isoprenoid ethers of glycerol 1\u2010phosphate whereas bacterial lipids fatty acid esthers of glycerol 3\u2010phosphate, i.e., the lipids in the two domains differ not only in their chemical composition but also in chirality).\n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n Thus, the reconstructed gene set of LUCA seems to display a remarkable nonuniformity in that some functional systems seem to reach elaborate complexity almost indistinguishable from that in modern organisms whereas others are rudimentary or missing.

Figures in this range have been inferred by all algorithmic methods for ancestral gene set reconstruction.\n5\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n19\n However, given the uncertainty associated with these approaches (see above), the more compelling argument for a complex LUCA is the complexity of the modern translation machinery that comprises indisputable LUCA heritage. The functioning of such an advanced translation system is predicated on commensurate metabolic capabilities, including not only the pathways for the synthesis of all nucleotides and (nearly) all amino acids, but also those for at least some coenzymes, for example, S\u2010adenosylmethionine, the cofactor of the numerous RNA methylases several of which can be traced back to LUCA with a high confidence.\n18\n, \n34\n Furthermore, the evolutionary relationships of some translation system components imply that these proteins are products of preceding complex evolution. A case in point are the aminoacyl\u2010tRNA synthetases (aaRS), the 20 enzymes (one for each amino acid) that are essential for translation and of which, at least, 18 are confidently traced back to LUCA.\n35\n, \n36\n The core catalytic domains of the aaRS represent two distinct classes that possess unrelated structural folds and cover 10 amino acid specificities each.
