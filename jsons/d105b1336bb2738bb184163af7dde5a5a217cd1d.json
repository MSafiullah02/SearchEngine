A combination of different modes of action has been demonstrated or proposed for the approved mAbs used in cancer treatments. Molecular mechanisms involved are predominately a direct cytotoxic action against cancer cells, an inhibitory effect on promitogenic signaling pathways, and immunomodulatory effects leading to the indirect destruction of cancer cells. For a small number of approved mAbs and a larger number in the development pipeline, a direct cytotoxic action is effected by a so-called antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) (Chap. 2 , section \"Antibody-Drug Conjugates\"), whereby cell killing is imparted by an attached bioactive payload of a potentially lethal toxin, drug, cytokine, or radionuclide. Examples are ibritumomab tiuxetan (section \"Ibritumomab Tiuxetan\"), brentuximab vedotin (section \"Brentuximab Vedotin\"), and trastuzumab emtansine (section \"Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine\"). Examples of cell-destructive immunomodulatory effects include antibodydependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and modulation of immune checkpoints by the targeting of inhibitory pathways regulating signaling between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Antibodies that induce ADCC and those that modulate immune checkpoints, namely, mAbs that target cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), are discussed later in this chapter.",

Cancer patients are therefore often tested for specifi c biomarkers known to be predictive of a benefi cial or poor response to a targeted agent. Examples are the selection of patients for trastuzumab therapy by testing for HER2 gene amplifi cation and identifi cation of patients unlikely to respond to cetuximab by detection of a mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog) gene. Unfortunately, not all patients predicted to respond on the basis of a biomarker result actually do so. For example, only 25-30 % of breast cancer patients who are HER2 amplifi cation positive respond to trastuzumab. This highlights the need for continued efforts to identify additional biomarkers that select those cancer patients most likely to benefi t from therapy with a particular mAb.",

            "text": "The dual antigen recognition specifi city of this mouse-rat hybrid mAb (Removab \u00ae ) (Tables 2.1 and 3.1 ) is effected by a mouse kappa light chain and IgG2a heavy chain and a rat lambda light chain and IgG2b heavy chain. Binding of the Fc region with Fc\u03b3 receptors provides a third functional binding site. The mouse Fab binds to EpCAM , the rat Fab binds to CD3, and the hybrid Fc fragment binds to Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), Fc\u03b3RIIa (CD32), and Fc\u03b3RIIIa (CD16a) on macrophages, NK cells, dendritic cells, and mononuclear cells (Fig. 3.1 ). EpCAM (CD326), a transmembrane glycoprotein, is shielded by tight junctions in normal tissue but expressed over the whole surface of tumor cells. It promotes tumor growth and metastasis and is overexpressed on epithelial tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, esophagus, head, neck, lung, liver, kidney, ovary, pancreas, and prostate and a number of other organs and tissues. Being so widely and strongly expressed, EpCAM has become a potentially useful target for antibody therapy of various carcinomas. Overexpression of EpCAM tends to be seen in advanced cases of cancer and those with a poor outcome. In relation to its approved indication for malignant ascites, EpCAM is expressed on most epithelial cancers of this type as well as the tumor cells in malignant effusions. The trifunctional action of catumaxomab involving antibody recognition of cancer cells expressing EpCAM ,  CD3 on activated lymphocytes, and effector functions mediated via Fc binding  results in T-cell-induced killing, ADCC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity  (CDC) , and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) through interaction with Fc\u03b3Rs on effector cells ( Fig. 3.1 ) . When used to treat malignant ascites, the commonly seen side effects of catumaxomab of fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are the result of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (Chap. 1 , section \"Cytokine Release Syndrome\"; Table 3 .1 ). The cytokines TNF and IL-6, for example, are elevated above normal levels in 60 and 80 %, respectively, of treated patients. Cytokine release is therefore a refl ection of both T-cell activation and the mode of action of catumaxomab. Pyrexia, nausea, and vomiting tend to be limited to the duration of therapy and manageable with standard symptomatic treatment. Abdominal pain is generally managed by standard pain medication, while antibody-induced grade 4 adverse events such as ileus are isolated occurrences often related to the malignancy. Lymphopenia, reported in up to 14 % of patients, is reversible, usually within a week. Cutaneous reactions of rash, erythema, pruritus, and catheter-related reactions such as erythema and infection also occur and can be serious. Up to the end of 2012, postmarketing reports from Europe listed eight cases of respiratory disorders, 11 cases of cutaneous reactions, 11 reports of infections, and eight cases of systemic infl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (Chap. 1 , section \"Systemic Infl ammatory Response Syndrome\") with associated pyrexia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and leukocytosis.",

            "text": "There is substantial evidence that cytotoxic T lymphocytes can have a major role in controlling the growth of tumors, but therapies aimed at utilizing this observation, for example, the use of CTLA-4-blocking antibodies, have shown only limited success, presumably because of immune avoidance by the cancer cells. Although T cells can show high cytotoxic potential, they lack Fc\u03b3 receptors and therefore cannot be recruited by conventional antibodies. This fact led to an approach based on single-chain antibodies that can link T cells and tumor cells bringing them into close proximity for cell killing to occur. Blinatumomab (Blincyto \u00ae ) (Tables 2.1 and 3.1 ), a so-called bispecifi c T-cell-engaging (BiTE) fusion protein composed of two antibody single-chain variable fragments each from an H and L chain, is an ~55 kDa protein derived from the linkage of the four peptide chains from four different genes. One of the two binding specifi cities is directed to the B-cell antigen CD19, while the other targets CD3, part of the T-cell receptor. Reaction with both antigens is exploited to link malignant B cells of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia to cytotoxic T cells, activating them to destroy the tumor cells via production of perforin and granzymes that induce apoptosis. Blinatumomab induces tumor regression at very low doses, for example, partial and complete tumor regressions have been fi rst observed at doses as low as 15 ng/sq m/day. FDA approval for blinatumomab in December 2014 was based on results of a phase II multicenter open-label study of 185 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The study revealed that 42 % of participating patients achieved complete or partial remission within two cycles of the drug, the majority improving within the fi rst treatment cycle. Thirty-two percent of patients achieved complete remission for about 6.7 months.",

            "text": "Blinatumomab approval by the FDA was issued with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). The most common adverse events seen with blinatumomab (Table 3 .1 ) in trials included pyrexia (62 %); neurological toxicity (50 %); headache (36 %); peripheral edema, febrile neutropenia, and nausea (each 25 %); hypokalemia (23 %); rash (21 %); and constipation (20 %). Neurological toxicities, ranging from confusion to tremors, convulsions, and speech disorders and all apparently reversible, frequently interrupted therapy. The majority of adverse events occurred within the fi rst week of treatment and usually faded to grade 1 or less upon further treatment. CRS, sometimes life-threatening or even fatal, was reported in 11 % of patients (see boxed warning, Table 3 .1 ). It has been suggested that CRS, in severe form at least, may be due to activation of macrophages triggered by cytokines released from T cells activated by blinatumomab. This is thought to lead to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (Chap. 1 , section \"Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis\"), a condition seen in a patient with CRS 36 h after infusion with blinatumomab. Symptoms of fever, circulatory collapse, and respiratory failure accompanied cytopenias, hypofi brinogenemia, and hyperferritinemia. HLH continued after withdrawal of blinatumomab but improved rapidly upon treatment with the IL-6 and infl ammation blocker tocilizumab. It has subsequently been suggested that patients given blinatumomab therapy should be monitored for HLH. Unlike antibodies that block CTLA-4, no autoimmune reactions have so far been observed following blinatumomab.",

CD20 also occurs on B-cell lymphomas, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and melanoma cancer stem cells but is absent from mature plasma cells and other tissues. The antigen may have a functional role in one or more of B-cell growth, differentiation, activation, and proliferation via intracellular signaling or as a calcium channel in association with the B-cell receptor, but, as yet, no CD20 ligand has been identifi ed. In addition to the effector processes initiated when bound to antibody, CD20 may be involved in transmembrane signaling controlling growth and cell death in some tumors. Due to its non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) B-cell expression and the fact that it is not normally shed from cells and is internalized after binding to antibody, CD20 has been seen as an exploitable target for mAbs for the treatment of lymphomas.

Given in combination with some selected small molecule chemotherapeutic drugs, it is now a fi rst-line therapy for several NHLs, including follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In 2002, the FDA authorized the use of rituximab as a component of ibritumomab therapy. The mechanisms underlying rituximab's cytotoxicity in cancer therapy are not completely understood. Tumor cell death is attributed to ADCC, CDC, and the induction of apoptosis, but other mechanisms, such as a vaccine-like action of increasing the cytotoxic T-cell response to idiotype antigens on the malignant cells, may also be operative. Rituximab is relatively successful as a treatment for B-cell malignancies, but the mAb is not effective in all patients where variable degrees of tumor resistance occur. This resistance remains poorly understood although many suggested mechanisms have been advanced including loss of CD20 expression, blockade of ADCC, expression of proteins that inhibit CDC, and expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Several strategies have been devised to overcome tumor cell resistance to rituximab but also to improve anti-CD20 mAb effi cacy. In relation to the latter, mAb has been conjugated to a radionuclide as seen with the development of 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (section \"Ibritumomab Tiuxetan\") and 131 I-tositumomab.",

A long list of side effects has been reported for the antibody including the serious events detailed in an FDA black box warning, namely, infusion reactions, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (Chap. 1 , section \"Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\"), tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) (Chap. 1 , section \"Tumor Lysis Syndrome\"), skin and mucocutaneous reactions (these four all potentially fatal), infections, hepatitis B reactivation, cardiac arrhythmias, and bowel problems as well as a host of often less serious systemic and cutaneous events and toxicities (Table 3 .1 ). Often seen as CRS, infusion reactions occur on the fi rst infusion in up to 77 % of malignant patients, and this decreases to approximately 10 % after the second infusion. Potentially serious symptoms including hypotension and bronchospasm may complicate the reaction in about 10 % of cases. An early relationship between rituximab administration, the lymphocyte count, and CRS suggested that the appearance of the syndrome correlated with lymphocyte counts higher than 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Patients with counts exceeding this fi gure experienced more reactions than patients with lesser numbers of tumor cells. A survey of hypersensitivity reactions to rituximab in patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 2006 and 2010 found immediate hypersensitivity in 79 of 901 patients (8.8 %). Approximately three-quarters of the patients showed symptoms after the initial infusion, and 46 % experienced moderate or severe reactions after subsequent infusions. An increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions occurred in patients with advanced disease, and obscurely, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia patients accounted for 10 % of the reactions despite making up only 1 % of the rituximab-treated patients. Other signs of hypersensitivity following rituximab administration are urticaria, cardiovascular and respiratory distress typical of an anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reaction, serum sickness, vasculitis, interstitial pneumonitis, some cutaneous manifestations, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cough, dyspnea, and bronchospasm are fairly common but pulmonary events can be serious, for example, pulmonary fi brosis which has proved fatal. A review of 62 cases of severe respiratory reactions thought to be caused by rituximab implicated interstitial pneumonitis in three-quarters of the subjects together with other respiratory disorders, bronchiolitis obliterans, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary fi brosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and ARDS. It has been suggested that rituximab should not be administered to patients with lung diseases such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, and collapsed lung.",

TLS may manifest as renal failure and a 2010 examination of the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring Adverse Event Data Bank revealed 114 reports associated with rituximab out of 182 case reports of PML. Table 3 .1 lists the serious and sometimes fatal mucocutaneous reactions reported for rituximab, most of which appear within approximately the fi rst three months of treatment. Combining rituximab with chemotherapy has produced adverse responses in up to 86 % of malignant patients with 57 % showing severe or serious signs. Hematologic events showed the highest incidence (67 %, 48 % severe or serious), followed by dermatologic reactions (44 %, 2 %), respiratory symptoms (38 %, 4 %), gastrointestinal symptoms (37 %, 2 %), musculoskeletal effects (26 %, 3 %), and cardiovascular disorders (25 %, 3 %). Overall, the incidences of a range of adverse events were higher in patients receiving rituximab plus chemotherapy than in patients receiving either therapy alone. Postmarketing surveillance of rituximab administration has confi rmed the importance of infections and respiratory and hematologic events in the safety profi le of this widely and heavily used mAb. Infections, with an incidence of 6.6 %, led the number of reports of adverse events in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database containing more than 16,700 reports. Hematologic (5.7 %), respiratory (3.7 %), and gastrointestinal symptoms (2.8 %) followed in that order. Infections were again the most commonly reported event (13 %) in the European Pharmacovigilance EudraVigilance Database Management System followed by respiratory events (11 %), hematologic events (10 %), nervous system disorders (7 %), gastrointestinal disorders (6 %), and infusion reactions (4 %). Interesting and noteworthy totals for individual disorders were CRS (44 reports), TLS (145), PML (423), JC virus infections (37), leukoencephalopathy (33), and bone marrow failure (137). Recorded fatalities totaled about 6 %. Other events reported by the FDA under the heading of postmarketing experience are late onset neutropenia; hyperviscosity syndrome in Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia; fatal cardiac failure; viral infections; immune/autoimmune events including uveitis, optic neuritis, vasculitis, lupus-like syndrome, serum sickness, pleuritis, and polyarticular arthritis; disease progression of Kaposi's syndrome; bowel obstruction and perforation; fatal bronchiolitis obliterans and interstitial lung disease; and the nervous system disorder, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (Chap. 1 , section \"Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome\").",

Rituximab infusion should be immediately ceased if serious infusion reactions occur and temporarily slowed or interrupted for less severe reactions. Patients should be monitored closely for extravasation during ibritumomab-yttrium-90 therapy, and infusion should be immediately stopped and restarted in another limb if signs of extravasation occur.

Subsequent accelerated approvals by the FDA, EMA, Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA), and Health Canada were restricted to CLL patients refractory to fl udarabine and alemtuzumab. The reasoning behind this indication is based on the poor survival outcomes of patients who become refractory to fl udarabine (normally the cornerstone of treatment of CLL) and alemtuzumab treatments. Although CD20 is sometimes described as an ideal target for mAbs in allowing effector recruitment for ADCC and CDC, different CD20-reactive mAbs can differ in their capacities to trigger programmed cell death. CD20 lodged in the cell membrane is thought to have two extracellular loops, a large one composed of about 44 amino acids and a smaller one which is thought to remain within the plasma membrane. Ofatumumab binds an epitope composed of both the large and small loops, which is a different region recognized by rituximab, and it is this different recognition that helps to increase ofatumumab-induced complement activation and complementmediated lysis. Ofatumumab's more potent CDC action than that of rituximab is thought to result from the close proximity of the CD20 small loop-binding site to the cell surface which aids the deposition of complement on the cell surface. Ofatumumab induces lysis in cells with high or low CD20 expression (such as freshly isolated CLL cells) and even in complement-resistant B-cell lines and cells expressing complement inhibitory molecules. In addition to its effi cient binding of C1q and activation of the complement pathway, ofatumumab induces cell death through ADCC and there is some evidence that binding of the mAb also recruits NK cells.",

In combination with bendamustine, approval for the mAb was extended to the treatment of follicular lymphoma in February 2016. Obinutuzumab is a humanized anti-CD20 mAb of the IgG1\u03ba class, MW ~150 kDa, glycoengineered and prepared in Chinese hamster ovary cells. \"Glycoengineered\" in this case means the presence of non-fucosylated sugars that impart higher binding affi nity for Fc\u03b3III receptors which, in turn, enhances ADCC and caspase-independent apoptosis (Chap. 2 , sections \"Glycosylation of Monoclonal Antibodies\" and \"Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated and Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicities\"). Modifi cation of elbow hinge sequences in the variable region may also contribute to the apoptotic activity of obinutuzumab. Like its fellow mAbs targeting CD20, obinutuzumab mediates B-cell lysis by engaging immune effector cells, directly activating intracellular pathways signaling cell death, activating the complement cascade, and effecting ADCC and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Although exhibiting less CDC than rituximab, obinutuzumab has demonstrated superior effi cacy. Patients with CLL and coexisting illnesses unable to tolerate combined intravenous chemotherapy are likely to be more tolerant of obinutuzumab in its approved indication of the mAb's combination with chlorambucil.",

These fi ndings were essentially supported by a comparison of obinutuzumab and rituximab, each combined with chlorambucil, in a study of 781 randomly assigned patients with previously untreated CLL. Adverse events were seen more frequently with the obinutuzumab-chlorambucil treatment. Grade 3-4 neutropenia, infusion reactions, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, and musculoskeletal pain were the most common events recorded. In addition to a black box warning for hepatitis B virus reactivation and PML, warnings and precautions issued by the FDA cover severe and life-threatening infusion reactions, TLS, the risk of infections, and cytopenias (Table 3 .1 ). Two-thirds of patients experienced infusion reactions by the time of the infusion of the fi rst gram of obinutuzumab. Symptoms included hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, and other respiratory problems such as bronchospasm, wheezing, and throat irritation. Late reactions (up to 24 h) have occurred. Premedication with acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid may be necessary. As is well known for TLS, patients with high tumor burden are at greater risk of acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia which can occur within 12-24 h of the fi rst infusion. Infections, sometimes serious, may be bacterial, fungal, or viral in origin. Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias may occur in patients given obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil; incidences of 34 % for neutropenia and 12 % for thrombocytopenia, respectively, were found in trials. Neutropenia may be of late onset and acute thrombocytopenia, occurring within 24 h of infusion, has been seen in up to 5 % of patients. Treatment-related neutropenia also appears to be more common than with other anti-CD20 mAbs. Apart from a few other common, and less serious, adverse events (Table 3 .1 ), more recent clinical trial experience has revealed the possibility of worsening of preexisting cardiac conditions with some fatal cardiac events occurring in patients treated with obinutuzumab. In a recently published nonrandomized, parallel-cohort, phase Ib, multicenter study of the safety and effi cacy of obinutuzumab plus fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide and obinutuzumab plus the nitrogen mustard bendamustine (SDX-105) used in the treatment of CLL and lymphomas, obinutuzumab in both combinations showed manageable toxicity. In the obinutuzumab-fl udarabine/cyclophosphamide cohort, 6 of 21 patients (29 %) experienced serious adverse events, 86 % experienced a grade 3-4 adverse event, 43 % experienced at least one grade 3-4 hematologic event (neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia), and 52 % had at least one infection. An infusion-related reaction occurred in 91 % of patients. In the obinutuzumab-bendamustine cohort, 9 of 20 patients (45 %) experienced serious adverse events, 85 % had a grade 3-4 event, and 60 % experienced at least one grade 3-4 hematologic event. Ninety percent of patients had an infusionrelated reaction, four of which were serious and most reactions occurred with the fi rst dose. Although cutaneous side effects of rituximab are well known and cover a wide spectrum of effects from mild sweating and pruritus to severe toxic epidermal necrolysis, paraneoplastic pemphigus, and lichenoid eruptions, reports of dermatologic reactions to other anti-CD20 mAbs are surprisingly rare. A fairly recent case of lichenoid eruption (Fig. 3 .2 ) ascribed to obinutuzumab was claimed to be the fi rst case report of a cutaneous side effect to the mAb.",

TNF receptorassociated factors 2 and 5 (TRAF2 and TRAF5) interact with the CD30 receptor expressed by activated T and B cells, mediating the signaling that leads to activation of NF-\u03baB. After binding to cells expressing CD30, the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab linked to its toxic payload MMAE is internalized before MMAE reaches the lysosomes where it is released, disrupting microtubules and ultimately inducing apoptosis. Free MMAE is also capable of exerting a toxic effect on bystander cells. Note that the half-life of the antibody-drug conjugate is 4-6 days compared to 3-4 days for MMAE.

In clinical trials with Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL patients, 54 % of subjects experienced neuropathy, predominately peripheral neuropathy which is cumulative. Of these patients, only about half had complete resolution of the condition with 20 % showing no improvement. Although infusion reactions to brentuximab vedotin are mostly mild-moderate, a small number of cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. Severe neutropenia and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia as well as febrile neutropenia occur. In clinical trials, myelosuppression in severe form showed an incidence of 9-21 %. Serious bacterial, fungal, and viral infections and opportunistic infections such as pneumonia and sepsis occur, and in patients with high tumor burden or a rapidly proliferating tumor, TLS may result. In clinical trials, the incidences of severe reactions and death were higher in patients with severe renal impairment; this may be due to higher exposure to MMAE compared to patients with normal renal function. It is a similar situation for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, but in any case, it should be recognized that serious cases of hepatotoxicity, including some fatalities, have resulted from brentuximab vedotin therapy. Cases have occurred after the fi rst dose or after rechallenge. A black box warning has been issued for PML after 13 postmarketing surveillance reports and three cases among 2000 brentuximab vedotin-treated clinical trial patients. PML and the mucocutaneous toxidermias, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, constitute three serious adverse events that, although rare, are potentially lethal, therefore requiring awareness and vigilance in assessing new onset signs and symptoms of central nervous symptom and mucocutaneous abnormalities. Common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520 % and regardless of causality) recorded in clinical trials with Hodgkin lymphoma patients given brentuximab vedotin were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, URTI, pyrexia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rash (Table 3 .1 ). When brentuximab vedotin was given with bleomycin, pulmonary toxicity manifesting as interstitial infi ltration and/or infl ammation occurred indicating that this combination of drugs is contraindicated. The most common serious events experienced by Hodgkin lymphoma patients given brentuximab vedotin include peripheral motor neuropathy (4 %), abdominal pain (3 %), and pulmonary embolism, pneumonitis, pneumothorax, pyelonephritis, and pyrexia, all with an incidence of 2 %. Experience with sALCL patients given brentuximab vedotin showed that the most commonly occurring adverse reactions were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, pain, and rash. The most common serious events experienced by sALCL patients were septic shock, supraventricular arrhythmia, pain in extremity, and urinary tract infection, all with an incidence of 3 %. Other serious adverse events, but with a much lower incidence, were PML, TLS, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The safety of brentuximab vedotin was evaluated in 25 Hodgkin lymphoma patients with relapsing disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The most frequent adverse events were cough, fatigue, and pyrexia (each 52 %), nausea and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 48 %), and dyspnea (40 %). The most common adverse events of severity \u2265grade 3 were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglycemia in that order. CMV was detected in fi ve patients. Overall, the safety data for brentuximab vedotin shows that neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, the risk of infections, and the worrying occasional case of PML are perhaps the most important adverse events provoked by the antibody-drug conjugate. Reports in the FAERS database at the end of 2012 included 40 cases of peripheral neuropathy (65 neurological disorders overall), 131 cases of infections, and 13 reports of PML. Other adverse events identifi ed during postapproval use include febrile neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, serious and opportunistic infections, hyperglycemia, pancreatitis (including fatal cases), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (including fatal outcomes).",

The early name for alemtuzumab, Campath-1, came from the original rat antibodies utilized in the Pathology Department, University of Cambridge. The name Campath-1H was adopted after the rat antibody hypervariable sequences were grafted onto a human antibody framework. CD52 is expressed on mature normal and malignant B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, a subpopulation of granulocytes, and dendritic cells as well as lymphoid and male sexual organs but not on erythrocytes, platelets, and hematopoietic stem cells. A fi gure of 5 \u00d7 10 5 CD52 molecules/cells has been reported for human lymphocytes. Approved by both the FDA and EMA in 2001 for the treatment of B-cell CLL resistant to alkylating agents and later as a single agent for the disease, alemtuzumab as Campath \u00ae and MabCampath \u00ae was widely used in cancer therapy until 2012 when it was withdrawn from US and European markets although a number of CLL patients could still receive it through specifi c access programs and some off-label usage in cancer therapy remains. Since 2012, alemtuzumab has been relaunched as Lemtrada \u00ae for multiple sclerosis (see Chap. 2 , Table 2 .1 , and Chap. 4 , section \"Alemtuzumab\"). After binding to CD52 on leukemic cells, alemtuzumab exerts its antitumor action primarily by ADCC with a contribution from CDC and induction of apoptosis.",

As well as a high incidence of neutropenia (75-85 %), febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (serious in 57 % of cases) may occur, the latter causing hemorrhagic problems and purpura. Infections related to alemtuzumab therapy have been reported with incidences of up to 80 % and serious events have shown incidences as high as 50 %. Bacterial and viral infections are common and are a signifi cant cause of death; in fact, fatalities among patients on alemtuzumab therapy are mostly connected to infections. Protozoal infections are occasionally seen, and opportunistic infections, including pneumocystis pneumonia, herpesvirus and CML infections, candidiasis, JC virus activation, aspergillus, and mucormycosis, are relatively frequent with incidences up to ~40 %. Mycobacterium tuberculosis , another possible risk organism for opportunistic infections, has been implicated in cases of tuberculosis in alemtuzumab-treated patients receiving a renal transplant from deceased patients.

            "text": "Tyrosine kinases are important targets for cancer therapy because of their central role in growth factor signaling leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. One of the four r elated growth factor receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, HER1, ErbB1), is a member of the ErbB family of receptors, a subfamily of closely related receptor tyrosine kinases. EGFR is a 170 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein cell surface receptor activated by the binding of its specifi c ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alfa (TGF\u03b1), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), amphiregulin, betacellulin, epigen, and epiregulin. After ligand binding, EGFR undergoes homodimerization although EGFR may also form a heterodimer with another member of the ErbB receptor family, for example, ErbB2 (HER2). After dimerization, the receptor-ligand complex is internalized, the autophosphorylation occurs, and the tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways lead to regulation of gene transcription involved with cell growth and survival, motility, and proliferation. Signal transduction, resulting from natural ligand-induced activation of the EGFR, leads to activation of the wild-type KRAS protein. In tumors with KRAS mutations, the mutant KRAS protein is continually active and appears to be independent of regulation by EGFR. In addition to the importance of EGFR in the processes of normal cellular functions and survival, expression of EGFR may contribute to the development of cancerous cells through effects on angiogenesis, cell cycle progression, inhibition of apoptosis, and metastasis. In a number of different tumors, EGFR and its ligands are associated with growth of the cells, and elevated EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is found in many, if not most, solid tumors including breast, renal, head and neck, colon, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate, glioma, and bladder carcinomas. The expression of EGFRs on malignant cells is often greater than the numbers expressed on normal cells. Table 3 .2 lists the percentages of different types of tumors overexpressing the EGFR. For cancers such as head and neck, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal carcinoma, most of the tumors express the receptor. The EGFR-binding mAbs cetuximab and panitumumab bind the receptor on both normal and tumor cells, competitively inhibiting binding of the normal ligands. Ligand-induced 25-77 % also quoted for colon cancer c Other percentages quoted, 40-63 % autophosphorylation of the receptor and activation of receptor-associated kinases are thus prevented, resulting in inhibition of cell growth and decreases in proinfl ammatory cytokines and the production of vascular growth factor.",

Monoclonal antibodies targeting the EGFR were therefore seen as a new approach for treating a range of solid tumors, one that could potentially avoid some of the limitations and safety issues associated with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. As it turned out, toxicity profi les of the mAbs are different to the toxicities of the conventional therapies (see below), but, disappointingly, mAbs along with other targeted cancer therapies have often proved effi cacious in only a minority of patients with benefi cial response rates varying from 10 % to about 90 %. This situation is clearly apparent with cetuximab and panitumumab both of which bind to, and inhibit, EGFR signaling. The absence of a signifi cant association between EGFR levels and a clinically improved response to cetuximab in colorectal cancer patients led to the fi ndings that patients with mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene almost never benefi t from cetuximab and panitumumab treatments, but 10-30 % of patients with the wild-type gene respond to the mAbs. As a result of this understanding, regulatory agencies restricted the use of cetuximab and panitumumab to colorectal cancer patients expressing the wild-type KRAS gene, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology issued a provisional clinical opinion stating: \"patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are candidates for anti-EGFR antibody therapy should have their tumor tested for KRAS mutations. If a KRAS mutation in codon 12 or 13 is detected, then patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma should not receive anti-EGFR antibody therapy as part of their treatment.\" Note, however, the codon 12 and 13 mutations of KRAS account for only ~40 % of the unresponsive patients, so it must be assumed that other mutations might be conferring resistance, and this appears to be the case with mutations in the BRAF (B-RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase), PI3KCA (phosphatidylinositol-4-5-biphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alfa), NRAS (neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog), and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) genes being signifi cantly associated with low response rates. Mutational analysis of KRAS and PI3KCA and evaluation of the PTEN protein status in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab and panitumumab showed 29 % KRAS and 13.6 % PI3KCA mutations. The latter were signifi cantly associated with clinical resistance to the mAbs and patients had a worse clinical outcome for survival. The analysis revealed that up to 70 % of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are unlikely to benefi t from treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies.",

In relation to anaphylaxis to cetuximab, IgE antibodies to \u03b1d -galactose-(1-3)-\u03b2-d -galactose were found in an alarming number of patients, especially in Southern USA, who experienced severe immediate hypersensitivity reactions after receiving the mAb.

The discovery of delayed-onset anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria after consuming red meat and being linked to tick bites and the presence of the alfa-linked disaccharide in red meat provide a possible explanation for this intriguing phenomenon.

Other warnings and precautions issued by regulatory agencies are for the possibility of interstitial lung disease which was recorded in 4 of 1570 patients (0.25 %); a variety of dermatologic events already known to occur, for example, \"acneiform\" rash (with an incidence of 76-88 %, up to 17 % serious), xerosis and fi ssuring, paronychial infl ammation, hypertrichosis, and infectious sequelae such as cellulitis and conjunctivitis; and hypomagnesemia and electrolyte abnormalities. Hypomagnesemia occurred in 55 % of 365 clinical trial patients being given cetuximab, and the condition proved severe (grades 3 and 4) in 6-17 % of participants. Of the more commonly reported adverse events (Table 3 .1 ), gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, electrolyte imbalance, and respiratory and cutaneous disorders rank amongst the highest incidences in both clinical trial results and postmarketing surveillance reports. As with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefi tinib, anti-EGFR antibodies like cetuximab and panitumumab frequently provoke so-called \"acneiform\" rashes (more correctly, papulopustular eruptions) in a large proportion of patients. These reactions are generally more severe with the mAbs than with the small molecule drugs and tend to be confi ned to seborrheic regions of the face, scalp, neck, shoulders, and upper trunk ( Fig. 3 .3a-c ). EGFR is expressed by cells in these regions and it is thought that its inhibition leads to defects in the epithelial barrier, allowing the entry of bacteria and ultimately the development of the characteristic rash. Addition of EGFR inhibition to radiotherapy may lead to radiation dermatitis enhancement, producing wet or dry desquamation, necrosis , or cutaneous ulceration ( Fig. 3 .3d, e ). Other far less frequent mucocutaneous adverse effects include pruritus, palmar-plantar rash, telangiectasia, trichomegaly, alopecia, hyperkeratosis, pyrogenic granuloma, skin hyperpigmentation, and mucositis. Severe mucositis is uncommon with EGFR inhibition therapy alone, but it is more likely to occur in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy ( Fig. 3 .3f, g ). EGFR inhibition can also affect differentiation of keratinocytes, leading to a decrease in loricrin and the development of xerosis and skin fi ssures ( Fig. 3.3h ). Paronychia, which may become superinfected, is a risk for all patients receiving anti-EGFR mAb therapy. As well as paronychia, other nail changes such as periungual pyogenic granuloma may occur ( Fig. 3.3i ).",

The rash tends to be papulopustular eruptions, three cases of aseptic meningitis, and two cases of PML.

The surprisingly high number of cases of anaphylaxis calls into question the criteria employed to classify the reactions as true, type I IgE antibody-mediated hypersensitivities. Without skin test and rituximab-reactive IgE antibody data on each individual, a diagnosis of anaphylaxis could not be fi rmly established. Aseptic meningitis is mentioned in 19 reports and PML in two.",

For colorectal cancer , both mAbs are equally effective. The antigenic structures recognized by cetuximab have been identifi ed as a large surface conformation on domain III of the EGFR (see above, section \"Cetuximab\"), and although the complementary structures to the panitumumab combining sites remain poorly defi ned, it is already clear that both epitopes are not identical. This conclusion is supported by instances of effective treatment with panitumumab in patients with disease progression under cetuximab and the development of resistance to treatment with cetuximab in a colorectal cancer patient who acquired a point mutation in the EGFR domain (Arg Fig. 3 .3 (continued) confi ned to seborrheic regions of the face, scalp, neck, shoulders, and upper trunk ( ac ).

It has been suggested that characterization of the binding sites of the two anti-EGFR mAbs could help predict the response to the mAbs in patients with mutations leading to resistance. In an effort to achieve this for panitumumab, epitope recognition was assessed by screening phage display peptide libraries. This approach identifi ed a discontinuous epitope that overlapped with the cetuximab epitope. The overlapping epitopes were shown to consist of 17 amino acids, four of which are targeted by cetuximab and four others by panitumumab. The authors believe that these results have the potential to improve treatments by using the recognition fi ndings to help select patients for EGFR-targeted therapies.",

Severe infusion reactions were said to occur in ~1 % of patients. In the revised prescribing information issued by the FDA in August 2014, reference to infusion reactions in the boxed warning was removed and dermatologic toxicities were stated to be severe in 15 % of patients. Mucocutaneous diseases provoked by panitumumab contribute to an extensive range of clinical manifestations including erythema, rash, pruritus, skin exfoliation, acneiform dermatitis, xerosis, paronychia, and skin fi ssures as well as life-threatening infectious complications such as necrotizing fasciitis and abscesses. Life-threatening bullous mucocutaneous diseases with erosions, blisters, and skin sloughing following panitumumab are known, but it is not always easy to ascribe these to antibody-induced inhibition of EGFR or to immune-related drug-induced toxidermias, for example, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Other warnings and precautions associated with the use of panitumumab (Table 3 .1 ) relate to the possibilities of severe infusion reactions (grade 3-4) with the reminder that fatal reactions have occurred; severe hypomagnesemia (which showed a 7 % incidence in clinical trials) as well as hypocalcemia and hypokalemia; acute renal failure resulting from severe diarrhea and dehydration when panitumumab is used in combination with chemotherapy; cases, some fatal, of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fi brosis; ocular toxicities such as keratitis and ulcerative keratitis; dermatologic toxicities caused by sunlight exposure as a result of panitumumab-induced photosensitivity; and the possibility of increased toxicity and mortality when panitumumab is administered in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy.

Importantly, when panitumumab was used in combination with chemotherapy, the safety profi le was assessed as the adverse events seen with the mAb as monotherapy plus the toxicities of the chemotherapy regimen. When this was done, no new toxicities or worsening of previously recognized toxicities beyond the expected additive effects were reported by the EMA. The most common adverse reactions (\u226520 %) listed by the FDA are skin rashes of variable presentation, paronychia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.

VEGFs are a family of secreted proteins with a highly conserved receptor-binding cystine-knot structure comprising fi ve members. Discovered in 1983 and often described as the \"founding member\" of the family, VEGF-A (also called VEGF and vascular permeability factor [VPF] ) is regarded as the most important regulator of the formation of blood vessels in health and disease. The fi ve members of the VEGF family are distinguished as VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placenta growth factor (PlGF, PGF). Before the discovery of the different family members, VEGF-A was simply called VEGF. VEGF-A binds to receptors VEGFR-1 (also called Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1) although it is the latter receptor that seems to mediate most, if not all, of the cellular responses to VEGF (Fig. 3.4 ) . In promoting angiogenesis, VEGF-A (and other VEGFs) acts in endothelial cells through a family of cognate receptor tyrosine kinases. As well as its function of promoting blood vessel formation in healthy subjects, VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis has a major role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human diseases, for example, cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, and eye diseases (see also ranibizumab, Chap. 4 , section \"Ranibizumab,\" and afl ibercept Chap. 6 , sections \"Afl ibercept\" and \"Afl ibercept\").

During VEGFR-2 intracellular signaling and according to MJ Cross, L Claesson-Welsh, and others, binding of VEGF-A to the receptor extracellular domain induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of specifi c intracellular tyrosine residues. Several intracellular proteins, for example, VEGFR-associated protein (VRAP), Sck, and phospholipase C (PLC-\u03b3), bind to specifi c phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the receptor via their Src homology-2 (SH2) domains leading to phosphorylation and activation of these proteins. PLC-\u03b3 activation leads to hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP 2 ), a generation of second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) an activator of protein kinase C, and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP 3 ) which binds to a receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum releasing intracellular stored Ca 2+ . Many other proteins are activated including Src, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and signal transduction downstream produces several physiologic and pathologic effects including proliferation, migration, permeability, and survival. To grow and proliferate, tumors need a matching blood supply. Increased expression of VEGF has been found in many human solid tumors, presumably fueling angiogenesis and assisting tumors to grow aggressively. By binding to V EGF-A, bevacizumab prevents activation of VEGFR-2 ( Fig. 3.4 ) and the generation of new tumor vasculature. It also appears that bevacizumab enhances cytotoxic effects of concurrent chemotherapy.",

An extensive list of warnings and precautions is headed by an FDA black box warning for gastrointestinal perforation (which has an incidence of up to 3.2 % in treated patients), complications of surgery and wound healing, and severe or fatal hemorrhage. The incidence of bevacizumab-induced gastrointestinal perforation is estimated to be 0.7-1.2 % with a mortality rate of 11.5-37 %. Because bevacizumab has a half-life of 11-50 days, a delay of 5-8 weeks between bevacizumab treatment and surgery is recommended, and for postoperative initiation of bevacizumab therapy, an interval of 28 days after surgery with a fully healed incision is recommended. Although these delays were observed, a patient treated with bevacizumab before surgery and a second cycle of bevacizumab treatment developed a diaphragmatic rupture, a previously unreported serious adverse event. The case highlights the need for careful monitoring after postoperative administration of bevacizumab. Non-gastrointestinal fi stulae, some fatal, involving vaginal, vesical, female genital tract, tracheoesophageal, biliary, renal, and bladder sites, also occur but are uncommon. Hemorrhage may be minor such as epistaxis or severe and sometimes fatal in the form of hemoptysis, gastrointestinal and vaginal bleeding, hematemesis, epistaxis, and CNS hemorrhage. Serious and fatal cases of pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported. Both arterial and venous thromboembolic events, some fatal, have been seen in patients receiving bevacizumab. Recorded arterial events include cerebral infarction, ischemic attacks, myocardial infarction, and angina. Cases of grade 3 or 4 hypertension have an incidence of 5-18 %, the incidence of proteinuria (frequency 21-63 %, serious 3 %) is increased in patients receiving the mAb, PRES has been reported with an incidence of <0.5 %, and although infusion reactions are not a major problem, some results indicate that anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions to bevacizumab occur more frequently in patients given the protein in combination with chemotherapy. Frequencies of severe neutropenia and serious infections are 21-26 % and 4-5 %, respectively, with pneumonia and wound and catheter infections prominent.

Whereas adverse reactions occurred within a median duration of four cycles, nine of 18 deaths due to an adverse reaction occurred after only one cycle. Reactions causing disability were mainly neurologic in origin (frequency 40 %), especially neuropathy, paralysis, and paresis. A search of the FAERS database for the period 2004-2009 for novel adverse events to bevacizumab revealed the highest number of reports for electrolyte abnormalities followed by cardiovascular events and pneumonitis. Clinically important but unlabeled disorders included necrotizing fasciitis, vessel wall disorders, arrhythmia and conduction disorder, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Of 37,000 reports on bevacizumab in the FAERS database at the end of 2012, infections (6.2 %), gastrointestinal (5.5 %), hematologic (3.8 %), and respiratory (3.5 %) events showed the highest incidences. More specifi cally, the postmarketing period has seen reports for polyserositis, PRES, venous occlusion, gallbladder perforation, nasal septum perforation, arterial thromboembolic events, hemorrhage, and numerous eye disorders (from unapproved intravitreal use), for example, permanent vision loss, endophthalmitis, intraocular infl ammation, retinal detachment, increased intraocular pressure, hemorrhage, vitreous fl oaters, and ocular hyperemia. In the European pharmacovigilance database at the end of 2012, gastrointestinal (incidence 20.4 %), neurologic (8 %), infectious (5 %), hematologic and malignant (4 %), cutaneous (3 %), and renal (2.5 %) disorders made up the most frequent adverse events of the 17,672 mostly serious reports. Hypertension contributed 597 cases, deep vein thrombosis 367, gastrointestinal perforation 333, proteinuria 243, sepsis 172, pneumonia 138, and acute renal failure 133, and there were 86 reported cases of nephrotic syndrome. Hypersensitivity or hypersensitivity-like responses showing the highest frequencies were anaphylaxis with 89 cases and anaphylactoid reactions with 39 cases. For mucocutaneous reactions, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia was the most common adverse event with 136 cases. Other less commonly seen adverse events reported during the postmarketing period include various ocular disorders, mesenteric venous occlusion, gastrointestinal ulcer, intestinal necrosis, anastomotic ulceration, gallbladder perforation, osteonecrosis of the jaw, nasal cavity lesions including septum perforation, and dysphonia.",

VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 are often upregulated in a number of human diseases including cancers, and since uncontrolled and sustained angiogenesis is a major contributor, if not promoter, of tumor growth, targeted inhibition of the development of blood vessels is an accepted antitumor strategy. This strategy can be pursued in at least four ways: by administering small molecule, usually multitargeted, tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors with anti-angiogenic specifi city (e.g., sorafenib, sunitinib, axitinib, pazopanib, and regorafenib) (Fig. 3.4 ) ; by the selective VEGF antagonist, the pegylated oligonucleotide pegaptanib (Macugen \u00ae ; indicated for wet age-related macular degeneration and the only aptamer currently approved for clinical use by the FDA), which binds to extracellular VEGF thereby inhibiting its binding to its receptor; by mAbs binding VEGF as practiced with bevacizumab binding VEGF-A (section \"Bevacizumab\") or the fusion protein afl ibercept which targets VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF; or by targeting the VEGFR-2 receptor, blocking not only the VEGF-A but also other growth factors including VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF-E. Ramucirumab is such an antibody, targeting VEGFR-2 with high affi nity and thereby inhibiting an array of biological activities including receptor activation and signaling, intracellular Ca 2+ mobilization, and proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (Fig. 3.4 ) . Tumor angiogenesis, a highly complex process, is the ultimate downstream result of VEGFR-2 activation and signaling. It begins with binding of VEGFR-2 to its ligand which initiates receptor dimerization and leads to intracellular autophosphorylation; activation of multiple downstream pathways including PLC-\u03b3, MAPK, Akt, and Src; proliferation of endothelial cells; and, ultimately, via PI3K, increased cell survival, cell migration, and vascular permeability mediated via endothelial nitric oxide synthase.",

The ErbB proteins are each receptor tyrosine kinases related to EGFR (section \"Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor: Cetuximab, Panitumumab, and Necitumumab\"). The structure of the HER2 receptor, a 185 kDa protein, consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane spanning section, and an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain with a regulatory carboxy-terminal. An intracellular tyrosine kinase domain also exists for HER1 and HER4 but not HER3. HER2 is inactive in the monomeric state and needs to be in the dimeric or oligomeric state for activation. Although there are 11 growth factors that activate the ErbB receptors (epidermal growth factor [EGF], transforming growth factor alfa [TGF\u03b1], heparinbinding EGF-like growth factor [HB-EGF], amphiregulin, betacellulin, epigen, epiregulin, and neuregulins 1, 2, 3, and 4), there is no known natural ligand for HER2. Activation of receptor kinase function proceeds mainly via ligand-mediated heteroor homodimerization. In addition to the ligand-dependent pathway for activation, ligand-independent receptor activation can occur with activation being triggered by overexpression of HER2 and a high concentration of cell surface receptors that results in the formation of HER2/HER2 homodimers. Overexpression of HER2 leads to constitutive activation of the growth factor signaling pathways with a consequent favorable environment for breast cancer cell growth. Heterodimers with EGFR, HER3, and HER4 also form. For receptor dimerization, HER2 is not only the preferred but also the most important partner. HER3 has a high affi nity for HER2 and the HER2/HER3 heterodimer appears to be the most potent in promoting the signal transduction process and tumor promotion. Autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of HER2 activates the MAPK, PI3K/ Akt, PLC-\u03b3, PKC, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways leading to cell survival and proliferation.",

Inhibiting downstream signaling arrests cell growth and leads to apoptosis, while ADCC further contributes to the mode of action of pertuzumab. The action of pertuzumab is independent of the level of expression of HER2. Although pertuzumab and trastuzumab target the same receptor, they recognize different binding sites. Trastuzumab (section \"Trastuzumab,\" below) binds to subdomain IV of the HER2 extracellular (ligand-binding) domain inhibiting ligand-independent signaling and complementing the mechanism of action of pertuzumab which inhibits ligand-dependent signaling, particularly between HER2 and HER3.

The EMA gave fi nal approval for pertuzumab in the same combination therapy in March 2013. The FDA has issued a boxed warning for pertuzumab covering cardiomyopathy manifesting as congestive heart failure and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and for embryofetal toxicity that may result in fetal death and birth defects. It is believed that patients who have received prior treatment with anthracyclines or prior radiotherapy to the chest may be at higher risk of decreased LVEF. The incidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) was found to be higher in pertuzumab-treated patients compared to trastuzumab-and docetaxeltreated patients, and there was an increased incidence of declines in LVEF in those treated with the mAb-drug combination. Administration of pertuzumab to pregnant women can harm the fetus, and the need for this warning is backed up by the observation of oligohydramnios, delayed development of fetal kidneys, and embryofetal death in pregnant monkeys.

In fact, cardiotoxicity to pertuzumab has been documented in several studies. In a phase I clinical study, two of 21 patients showed a reduction in LVEF and one developed congestive heart failure after two cycles of pertuzumab. Decreases in LVEF have also been observed in trials of ovarian and advanced prostate cancer patients treated with pertuzumab. In a study to evaluate safety and effi cacy of pertuzumab with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, 11 patients were given 64 cycles of the mAb combination. Echocardiograms and magnetic imaging studies showed LVSD in six patients, three with grade 1, two with grade 2, and one with grade 3 reactions. Although the observed cardiotoxicity was asymptomatic and reversible (and trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction is generally reversible), it must be said that the long-term cardiac effects of pertuzumab-trastuzumab treatments are yet to be determined. More recently, a database of 598 patients treated with pertuzumab was used to examine the incidence of asymptomatic LVSD and symptomatic heart failure. Of 331 patients treated with pertuzumab alone, 23 (6.9 %) developed LVSD and one (0.3 %) displayed symptomatic heart failure. The corresponding fi gures for 175 patients treated with pertuzumab in combination with a non-anthracycline cytotoxic agent were six (3.4 %) and two (1.1 %) and for 93 patients treated with trastuzumab, six (6.5 %) and one (1.1 %). The results revealed that pertuzumab given as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic agents, including trastuzumab, showed a low incidence of cardiac dysfunction similar to trastuzumab. In response to the mAb, patients experienced relatively low incidences of both LVSD and symptomatic heart failure, and there was no signifi cant increase in cardiac side effects when pertuzumab was given in combination with other anticancer agents.

Pertuzumab (see above, section \"Pertuzumab\") is known to bind to the extracellular subdomain II of HER2, blocking ligand-induced HER2/HER3 dimerization (Fig. 3.5b ) . Trastuzumab binds to HER2 subdomain IV causing downregulation of PI3K/AKT signaling in tumor cells overexpressing HER2 in the absence of ligands, but it seemed accepted that this mAb did not block dimerization of HER2 with ligand-activated HER1 (EGFR) or HER3. In the early 2000s, it was shown that preventing the expression of HER3 or its interaction with HER2 produced an antiproliferative effect in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Following up these observations, researchers at Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, used RNA silencing of HER receptor expression and a tumor-inducible HER3 knockdown model to show that EGFR has no role in HER2-positive breast cancer and, of greater signifi cance, constitutively active HER2 is dependent on HER3 for mediating its effects. While it is clear that trastuzumab exerts its antitumor activity via a number of different mechanisms, it is also apparent that a detailed understanding of the mAb's mode of action is far from complete. A brief summary of the current understanding is as follows. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular domain of HER2, downregulating the expression of HER2 on the cell surface and blocking cleavage of the domain preventing the formation of the constitutively active membrane-bound protein, p95-HER2. These events ultimately reduce PI3K and MAPK signaling. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 has an important role in trastuzumab-induced cell cycle arrest and tumor inhibition by binding to, and inhibition of, cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes and inhibition of G1/S progression. It now seems that trastuzumab also selectively inhibits ligand-independent HER2-HER3 heterodimerization and disrupts the HER2-HER3-PI3K complex (Fig. 3 .5 ) in both trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-insensitive cells. In the light of these fi ndings, it was suggested that blocking the HER2/HER3 receptor complex with a combination treatment of trastuzumab and pertuzumab might be particularly effi cacious in HER2-amplifi ed breast cancer. Finally, in addition to the above actions, trastuzumab has anti-angiogenic effects lowering the threshold for tumor cell killing by cytotoxic drugs, and it displays signifi cant ADCC activity by Fc interaction with Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptors on immune effector cells such as NK cells and macrophages.",

            "text": "Despite the advance in treatment offered by trastuzumab for aggressive breast cancer, only about 30 % of patients with advanced disease benefi t from monotherapy with the drug. Furthermore, a large proportion of patients (~70 %) who experience an initial benefi cial response become resistant within a year. Resistance is especially marked in advanced gastric cancer. Possible mechanisms of resistance have been studied. One proposed mechanism, so-called epitope masking, involves overexpression of membrane mucins such as Muc4 which, to some extent, masks the epitope recognized by the mAb on HER2. Precipitation experiments demonstrated that HER2 and Muc4 interact, knockdown of Muc4 increases trastuzumab binding, and upregulation of Muc4 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells results in acquired resistance to trastuzumab. A second possible mechanism of trastuzumab resistance may be the failure of the antibody to suppress the progression of tumors expressing truncated HER2 isoforms. Trastuzumab blocks cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER2 and prevents the formation of constitutive p95-HER2, but oncogenic HER2 exists in multiple isoforms and in some cancers the extracellular domain-binding epitope may be lacking. Cross-signaling is another potential mechanism of trastuzumab resistance. Several molecules appear to activate HER2 in the presence of trastuzumab including insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor Met, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), and members of the ErbB family. The precise mechanisms underlying such cross-signaling generally remain unclear. Activation of, or increased downstream signaling, for example, by PI3K, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and Src, may also counter the upstream inhibition exerted by trastuzumab. Activation of PI3K may occur as a result of mutations of reduced expression of the PTEN gene, deregulated signaling from upstream, or mutations of the PI3KCA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alfa) gene. Little or no contribution from the normally present ADCC activity of trastuzumab is yet another possible mechanism of resistance to the mAb. This may occur because of impairment or loss of Fc and Fc gamma receptors and/or disruption of antibodytarget cell or antibody-NK cell interaction (Chap. 2 , section \"Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated and Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicities\").",

            "text": "With approved indications for breast cancer, metastatic gastric, and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas overexpressing HER2, trastuzumab is the subject of an FDA black box warning for cardiomyopathy, infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity. For patients receiving trastuzumab as a single agent or in combination therapy, there is a four-to sixfold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction. Incidences are highest when an anthracycline drug is coadministered. Trastuzumab therapy can result in cases of left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, hypertension, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, and cardiac death. Cardiac monitoring including determination of LVEF is recommended. Reported incidences of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity are 2-7 % for monotherapy, 2-13 % for trastuzumab combined with paclitaxel, and up to 27 % when given in combination with anthracyclines. In an early clinical trial, 136 of 844 patients (16 %) discontinued trastuzumab due to myocardial dysfunction or a decline in LVEF. In two other trials, 2.6 and 2.9 % discontinued the mAb due to cardiotoxicity. Infusion reactions may be relatively mild but serious and fatal reactions have been reported. Serious and fatal pulmonary toxicities following trastuzumab include dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infi ltrates, pleural effusions, pulmonary insuffi ciency and hypoxia, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, ARDS, and pulmonary fi brosis. Other warnings and precautions refer to exacerbation of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and febrile neutropenia and the possibility of fetal harm with trastuzumab increasing the risk of oligohydramnios during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Common and serious adverse events caused by trastuzumab are listed in Table 3 .1 . One important adverse event in need of closer analysis became apparent in early results from trials when a surprisingly high incidence of congestive heart failure was noticed in patients treated concurrently with the anthracycline doxorubicin. Early observations showed that approximately 5 % of patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy developed evidence of systolic cardiac dysfunction with an incidence 4-5 times higher than controls. In a retrospective analysis of long-term cardiac tolerability of trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer in 218 patients who received trastuzumab for at least 1 year, 28 % of patients experienced some type of cardiac event, 10.9 % had grade 3 cardiotoxicity, and there was one cardiac death. Fortyfi ve percent of patients with breast cancer are older than 65 years, and bearing in mind that recent reports indicate that trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity is now more often seen than indicated in the early clinical trials, there is a concern that older patients are at higher risk. This concern was reinforced in 2012 by results of an Italian study of 490 patients treated with trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting; whereas the overall rate of congestive heart failure was 27 %, it was 38 % in patients over 68. In a larger study of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity in older patients, the incidence of congestive heart failure among those given trastuzumab was 29.4 % of 2203 patients (median age 71 years) compared with 18.9 % of those who did not receive the mAb. Patients given trastuzumab were also more likely to develop congestive heart failure, and in this group there was an increased risk of congestive heart failure in older patients, in those given trastuzumab weekly, and in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. Note that in the pivotal clinical trials, only 4 % of patients given trastuzumab experienced a cardiac event and this compared with 1.3 % in the control groups. The fi nding that the frequency of administration of trastuzumab, namely, once a week, was associated with a higher risk leaves some questions, in particular, is more frequent administration associated with more myocyte damage and is the fi nding unique to older patients? Of course, it must be remembered that trastuzumab cardiotoxicity usually appears to be reversible-89 % of patients showing an asymptomatic decrease in LVEF apparently recovered after stopping therapy with the mAb. As to the likely mechanism of trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction, it has been speculated that since HER2 may be involved in a number of different biological processes of cardiomyocytes, trastuzumab may have a direct effect on myocytes.",

Each molecule of trastuzumab may be linked to as many as eight DM1 molecules although the average number is 3.5. In an examination of the drug (toxin) distribution profi le of prepared DM1trastuzumab conjugates by mass spectrometry and peptide mapping, up to 20 chemically modifi ed lysine residues linked via \u03b5-amino groups were found on Fig. 3.6 Structure of ado-trastuzumab emtansine formed by covalently coupling trastuzumab to the cytotoxic microtubule inhibitor, mertansine, or DM1 (shown in red ), via the bifunctional crosslinker SMCC (succinimidyl trans-4-(maleimidylmethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) that contains a reactive succinimide ester and a reactive maleimide that links to thioethers (shown in blue ). The succinimide reacts with a trastuzumab lysine; the maleimide group covalently links to the free sulfhydryl group of DM1. The mertansine structure of the resultant complex together with the linkage group is designated the emtansine component. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine contains an average of 3.5 DM1 molecules for every molecule of trastuzumab both light (~7 residues) and heavy chains (~13 residues) of the conjugated mAb. The conjugated lysines were freely accessible and none were found in the antibody complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Random conjugation of the mAb lysine residues led to heterogeneity refl ected in the number of attached toxin molecules and the different sites of their linkage. Crystal structures of the Fab and Fc fragments (Fig. 3.7 ) containing the modifi ed lysine residues revealed that most of the residues are structurally and solvent accessible in the surface loops of the mAb. Only two modifi ed lysines, Lys323 and Lys 393 in the heavy chain, are located in \u03b2-sheets (Fig. 3.7 ) . The methodology used in this study should prove applicable to the identifi cation of modifi ed amino acid residues in other ADCs and different immunoconjugates. Linkage of DM1 to trastuzumab does not impair the binding of the mAb to HER2, it does not reduce its antitumor action, the linkage is nonreducible and non-cleavable, and there has been no evidence of toxic systemic exposure to free DM1 as a result of accumulation after repeated doses of the ADC. The covalent conjugate remains stable in both the circulation and tumor environment with the release of DM1 occurring only upon proteolytic degradation of the coupled mAb.",

After binding of ado-trastuzumab emtansine to HER2, the HER2-T-DM1 complex enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis where it is internalized by passage through endocytic vesicles to early endosomes and to mature lysosomes ( Fig. 3.8 ) .

Denosumab (Xgeva \u00ae , Prolia \u00ae ) (Tables 2.1 and 3.1 ), produced in transgenic mice, is a fully human IgG2\u03ba mAb, MW ~147 kDa, with high specifi city and affi nity for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, otherwise known as RANKL. Produced and expressed or released principally by cells of the osteoblast lineage and activated T cells, RANKL, a cytokine and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (also called TNFSF11) (Chap. 5 ) responsible for bone resorption, is expressed in both soluble and membrane-bound forms. Expression is controlled by a number of cytokines and hormones, mainly IL-1, IL-6, TNF, 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D 3 , parathyroid hormone, and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (Chap. 7 , section \"Parathyroid Hormone\"), prolactin, prostaglandin E2, and corticosteroids. RANKL stimulates osteoclast formation, activation, adherence, survival, and ultimately resorption of the bone. Inhibition of RANKL results in an increase in bone density, volume, and strength. The actions of RANKL are effected via its cognate receptor RANK which is expressed on osteoclasts and their precursors. Binding of RANKL with its receptor occurs by interaction between extracellular domains of the ligand and extracellular cysteine-rich domains of the receptor. This activates several signaling pathways, in particular, protein kinase and NF-\u03baB pathways, the latter upregulating c-fos in inducing gene transcription. The balance and coordination between the activities of osteoclasts and osteoblasts control bone formation, loss, and remodeling; osteoclasts fi rst resorb the bone, osteoblasts follow, and regenerate it. A second member of the TNF family, osteoprotegerin, is also a player in the osteoclast-RANK-RANKL-induced balance of bone formation and loss. Osteoclast activity, at least in part, ultimately depends on the ratio of RANKL to osteoprotegerin since the latter binds RANKL preventing its binding and activation of RANK and leading to the inhibition of osteogenesis and resorption. Osteoprotegerin has been shown to markedly reduce the numbers of osteoclasts in bone lesions, for example, when neoplastic cells metastasize in the bone. In fact, superfi cially at least, osteoprotegerin and denosumab have similar mechanisms of action. Expression of osteoprotegerin is induced by the cytokines transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and by estrogen, calcitonin, and calcium.",

CTLA-4 has a critical role as an inhibitory regulator during the early stages of T-cell expansion. For T lymphocyte activation to occur, a na\u00efve T cell needs to receive two precise signals from an antigen-bearing, antigen-presenting cell (APC) (dendritic cell, macrophage, or B cell). The fi rst activation signal comes via the membraneassociated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in its interaction with the T-cell receptor (TCR), while the second activation event is the provision of costimulatory signals effected by the APC membrane protein ligand CD80 (B7-1) working in tandem with membrane ligand CD86 (B7-2). The complementary receptor for these ligands is CD28, a protein constitutively expressed on na\u00efve T cells that enhances IL-2 production and allows the cells to undergo clonal expansion. CTLA-4 is expressed on the lymphocyte surface but only becomes functional after the start of T-cell activation when it competitively interacts with the B7 ligands ( Fig. 3.9 ) resulting in interference with IL-2 secretion and receptor expression and downregulation of the T-cell response. When bound to the B7 complex on APCs where it binds with greater affi nity than CD28, CTLA-4 has been described as an immune \"off\" switch playing an important role in modulating overactivity of T cells and maintaining tolerance to self-antigens. However, another consequence of suppressing the immune response can be to allow cancer cells to be recognized as self and multiply in the absence of antitumor immune challenge. Recognition of the crucial role of CTLA-4 as an inhibitory regulator of the T lymphocyte response and studies of murine models of cancer led to the strategy of blockade of the receptor by specifi c antibody (Fig. 3 .9 ) and this in turn resulted in the development of the mAb ipilimumab. Blocking antibodies such as ipilimumab, an example of immune checkpoint targeting, exert an antitumor action by at least two mechanisms: blockadeinduced clonal expansion of activated CD3+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes (and also probably CD8+ cells) and depletion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) CD4+ CD25+ which are induced by the tumor and act to inhibit immune recognition of tumor antigens. In addition, an increase in Th17 CD4+ T cells producing cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 was found to be associated with fewer relapses in a trial of patients treated with ipilimumab. Ipilimumab does not exhibit CDC activity, but at high concentrations it exerts weak to moderate ADCC activity on activated T cells probably via IgG Fc Fc\u03b3RI (CD64) rather than Fc\u03b3RIII receptors.",

In fact, the FDA has a black box warning for severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions due to T-cell activation and proliferation. Although these reactions may involve any organ system, the most common ones include enterocolitis; hepatitis; neuropathy (e.g., Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myasthenia gravis); endocrinopathy The cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) acts at the fi rst checkpoint to modulate overactive T cells by competing for the B7 ligands. CTLA-4 only becomes functional after the start of T-cell activation when it competitively interacts with the B7 ligands resulting in downregulation of the T-cell response. Suppressing the immune response allowing cancer cells to be recognized as self and thus multiplying in the absence of antitumor immune challenge led to the strategy of blockade of the receptor by the anti-CTLA-4 immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody ipilimumab. The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor acts as another important immune checkpoint. Binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 suppresses T-cell proliferation and activity allowing the tumor cells to avoid immune recognition and attack. Blocking at this second checkpoint by anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab results in the reactivation of T cells including those with specifi city for the tumor cells (hypopituitarism, adrenal insuffi ciency, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism); severe cutaneous events such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis; and immune-mediated ocular manifestations, uveitis, iritis, or episcleritis. A number of studies have led to and supported claims that ipilimumab elicits a high rate of immune-related adverse events. A recent review of records from 298 melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab revealed that 85 % experienced an immune-related adverse event of any grade, 19 % had to discontinue therapy due to the event, and 35 % of patients examined required systemic corticosteroids for their adverse event. In 31 of the 298 patients (10.4 %), symptoms did not resolve, necessitating the administration of anti-TNF therapy. One conclusion reached by the investigators was that ipilimumab can activate immune reactions against normal tissues leading to diarrhea, hepatitis, hypophysitis, and rash.",

IL-6, produced by many different cells including lymphocytes, monocytes, fi broblasts, and endothelial and cancer cells, is a pleiotropic cytokine with a complex action producing both proinfl ammatory and anti-infl ammatory effects. Promotion of infl ammation by IL-6 results from its role in the activation and proliferation of T cells, stimulation of B cells, induction of acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP) in the liver, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-6's antiinfl ammatory role appears to be centered on inhibitory effects in turning off or modulating the synthesis of TNF, IL-1, and IL-10. The intricate interplay of pro-and anti-infl ammatory effects of IL-6 suggests that the cytokine may be an important, if not sometimes crucial, participant in the parthenogenesis and/or response to some diseases. In fact, increased levels of IL-6 are known to be associated with a variety of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmunities, Alzheimer's disease, neoplasia, atherosclerosis, Paget's disease, osteoporosis, and others. Cancers associated with increased production of IL-6 include renal cell carcinoma, prostate and bladder cancers, some neurologic cancers, and particularly multiple myeloma and the B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, Castleman's disease. Castleman's disease may be localized or unicentric, or multicentric when it is characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms. Approximately half of the cases of multicentric Castleman's disease are caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8 or KSHV, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus), but the cause(s) of the other 50 % is unknown. Regardless, IL-6 has a central role in the pathophysiology of the multicentric form with its excess production leading to production of B lymphocytes and plasma cells, autoimmune reactions, and secretion of VEGF.",

Signaling proceeds through the JAK/STAT and Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling pathway after activation by phosphorylation of the phosphatase SHP-2 by JAK1. Cells that express gp130 only, do not respond to IL-6; IL-6 can only bind to cells expressing IL-6R. The receptor IL-6R, also found in soluble form (sIL-6R), binds IL-6 with an affi nity comparable to the membrane-bound receptor. Importantly, cells expressing gp130, even in the absence of IL-6R, can respond to the complex of IL-6-sIL-6R. This process is called trans-signaling.

            "text": "In its vital balancing role of protecting against self-antigens while retaining an activated state to protect against foreign antigens, the immune system requires a number of checks and balances to maintain the necessary healthy equilibrium of self-tolerance, prevention of autoimmune reactions, the defense against invading organisms, and elimination of aberrant cells. The bases of these checks and balances are immune cells, particularly the T cell, together with an array of ligands and receptors that effect the many activation and inhibitory processes required for the stimulation and curtailment of immunostimuli. In relation to cancer, the terms \"immune checkpoints\" and \"checkpoint inhibitors\" refer to a number of molecules, usually proteins, on cell surfaces that exert a co-inhibitory effect on the immune response, for example, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) which acts at the fi rst checkpoint (see section \"Ipilimumab\") to modulate overactive T cells by competing for the B7 ligands (Fig. 3.9 ). The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, CD279) receptor which plays a critical role in cancer immunology acts as another important immune checkpoint. PD-1 is a transmembrane protein receptor of the Ig superfamily expressed on T cells during thymic development and on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B lymphocytes, NK cells, B cells, monocytes, and some dendritic cells during antigen signaling. PD-1 has two ligands, PD-L1 (CD274, B7-H1) and PD-L2 (CD273, B7-DC). Whereas the affi nity of PD-L2 for PD-1 is three times higher than the affi nity of PD-L1, it is expressed on fewer cells and cell types, for example, it is not present on resting cells but is inducibly expressed on dendritic cells, macrophages, and some B cells. PD-L1 is expressed on both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells and cells of solid tumors. High expression of PD-L1 appears to be associated with increased aggressiveness of cancers and death. During PD-1 signaling in T cells, recruited phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 cause dephosphorylation of associated signaling molecules downstream from the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex. Akt activation is inhibited via the PI3K pathway, and Akt signaling leads to suppression of T-cell proliferation, decreased protein synthesis, and survival and suppression of IL-2 production which further inhibits T-cell proliferation and survival.",

While remaining free of its complementary ligands, PD-1 does not interfere with the normal immune response, but, upon binding PD-L1 and PD-L2, signaling is induced, suppressing T-cell proliferation and activity. Malignant cells, including melanoma cells, often express PD-L1 which, upon binding, induces inhibitory signaling through the receptor preventing expansion of activated T cells and allowing the tumor cells to avoid immune recognition and attack. In other words, T-cell targeting of tumor cells can be subverted by cancer cells expressing PD-1 ligands and effectively using the PD-1 inhibitory pathway to blunt the immune antitumor response. Thus, it follows that selectively blocking the pathway should reverse the checkpoint inhibition and restore the T-cell-mediated response to the tumor. This strategy has, in fact, been adopted with the development and subsequent approval of mAbs designed to bind to PD-1 and prevent interaction of the receptor with its ligands (Fig. 3.9 ) . Recent trials have shown that two of the mAbs, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, show encouraging clinical benefi ts with impressive high response rates and toxicity profi les superior to ipilimumab, all leading to the impression, so far, that PD-1 may be a better target for cancer therapy .",

Serious effects occurred in 36 % of patients with the most frequent serious reactions being renal failure, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cellulitis. Some other immune-mediated adverse reactions, namely, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and exfoliative dermatitis, were clinically signifi cant but occurred in less than 1 % of patients. Based on its mechanism of action, a warning/precaution for pembrolizumab has also been issued for fetal harm. The most common adverse events reported are listed in Table 3 .1 .",

FDA approvals for the treatment of patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, and advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma have recently been announced. Like pembrolizumab, nivolumab is subject to warnings for immune-mediated adverse events of pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, renal failure, and nephritis in melanoma patients. Other clinically signifi cant, immune-mediated adverse events occurring in less than 1 % of treated melanoma patients were pancreatitis, uveitis, autoimmune neuropathy, demyelination, adrenal insuffi ciency, facial and abducens nerve paresis, hypophysitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypopituitarism, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and myasthenic syndrome. Awareness of the potential risk of embryofetal toxicity is a necessary additional precaution for pregnant women given nivolumab. Clinically signifi cant nivolumab-induced adverse events were also assessed in 574 patients with solid tumors enrolled in clinical trials.

It is known that tumors with some carbohydrate antigens expressed at high levels show accelerated rates of metastasis and progression. The sialic glycosphingolipid (ganglioside), disialoganglioside (GD2), a short sialylated polysaccharide linked to ceramide through a \u03b2-glycosidic linkage (Fig. 3 .10 ) and found highly expressed on neuroectoderm-derived cancers such as neuroblastoma, melanoma, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma in children, is one such tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen. Signifi cantly from the safety viewpoint, GD2 is not present on normal tissues and minimally expressed in the brain and peripheral nerves. The incidence of GD2-positive tumors in the USA is estimated to be in excess of 200,000 annually, and considering the high mortality rate of these cancers and the high priority given to GD2 as a potential target for cancer therapy, a number of strategies to exploit the therapeutic possibilities of this antigen have been investigated over the last three decades. One of the most promising approaches has been the development of mAbs targeted to GD2 for use in passive antibody therapy, but this strategy has faced the dual challenges of antibody affi nity and tumor cell killing on the one hand and potential toxicities with pain inducement toward nerves and melanocytes on the other hand. Dinutuximab (ch14.18, Unituxin \u00ae ) (Tables 2.1 and 3.1 ), a human-mouse chimeric IgG1\u03ba mAb that binds GD2, received approval to treat neuroblastoma from the FDA in March 2015 and Fig. 3 .10 Structure of ganglioside (G2), an antigen expressed on human tumors of neuroectodermal origin. The disialylated polysaccharide structure is linked to ceramide through a \u03b2-glycosidic linkage. The structure contains one molecule each of dglucose, N-acetyl-dgalactosamine, and dgalactose with two attached N-acetylneuraminic acid residues. Only one of the various lipoforms is shown from the EMA in May 2015. After being shown to prevent the outgrowth of experimental melanoma and neuroblastoma tumors, this mAb was found to have an acceptable safety profi le in clinical trials on patients with neuroblastoma, melanoma, and osteosarcoma. Dinutuximab had been given an orphan product designation and received priority review and a pediatric disease priority review. A combination of the antibody with the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Chap. 5 , section \"Colony-Stimulating Factors: Filgrastim, Sargramostim, and Tbo-fi lgrastim\") was judged to enhance effi cacy. Approved indications for dinutuximab now state that it should be used in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2, and 13-cis-retinoic acid for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who achieve at least a partial response to prior fi rst-line multiagent, multimodality therapy.",

From the study of a case of thrombocytopenia induced by rituximab and a review of the literature, it was not possible to implicate rituximabdependent antibodies and IL-1 and IL-6 were not increased, but complement levels were elevated. This led the authors to conclude that mAb-induced transient thrombocytopenia might be mediated by complement activation and associated with CRS. Two cases of transient severe thrombocytopenia during rituximab therapy, one in a patient with mantle cell lymphoma and the other with hairy cell leukemia, reversed a few days after the antibody was withdrawn, but, again, the underlying mechanisms were not investigated. Other mAbs implicated in treatment-related thrombocytopenia include trastuzumab and alemtuzumab. When the latter was given for early multiple sclerosis, ~3 % of patients developed potentially fatal thrombocytopenia, and of 11 patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders given alemtuzumab, fi ve developed lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.",

Infusion reactions provoked by mAbs usually begin within hours of the initial infusion. Reactions are typically mild to moderate manifesting as \"fl u\"-like symptoms of fever, chills, rigor, headache, nausea, asthenia, pruritus, and rash. In a small number of patients, severe, life-threatening symptoms common to type I IgE antibody-mediated anaphylaxis, in particular, hypotension, bronchospasm, cardiac arrest, and urticaria, may occur, usually during the fi rst or second infusion (Chap. 1 , section \"Hypersensitivities\"). The similarity of the signs and symptoms can make it diffi cult to distinguish an infusion reaction from a true allergic hypersensitivity although IgE-mediated reactions generally have a faster and more severe onset, usually within minutes. Severe reactions have been reported for all, or almost all, the mAbs although some show a much higher incidence with the chimeric rituximab and humanized trastuzumab antibodies being the leading offenders. The incidence of reactions for cetuximab, another human-mouse chimera, is ~15-20 % (grade 3-4, 3 %); for trastuzumab, fi rst infusion ~40 % (grade 3-4, <1 %); and for rituximab, fi rst infusion ~77 % (grade 3-4, 10 %). Approximately 80 % of fatal infusion reactions to rituximab occurred after the fi rst infusion, and 30 and 14 % of patients still reacted after the fourth and eighth infusions, respectively. Even though trastuzumab is a humanized mAb, it induces a relatively high incidence of infusion reactions, but bevacizumab, another humanized antibody, shows a reaction incidence of only <3 % (grades 3-4, 0.2 %) which is similar to the fully humanized panitumumab (3 %, grades 3-4, ~1 %). Elotuzumab, recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, provokes infusion reactions in a large proportion of patients and needs to be given with premedication (Table 3 .1 ). The mechanisms of mAb-induced infusion reactions are not yet fully understood. Cytokines, especially TNF and interleukins such as IL-6, may be involved since the symptoms they produce resemble those seen in infusion (and type I allergic) reactions. An important fi nding was the observation that the severity of infusion reactions is related to the number of circulating lymphocytes. For example, a severe reaction is thought to require a lymphocyte count of >50 \u00d7 10 9 /L. CRS may be seen after the use of mAbs directed to malignant immune cells, for example, rituximab. It is thought that the systemic infl ammatory response produced together with a high fever is a consequence of antibody binding to and activating the cells. The distinguishing features in the liter ature bet ween CRS and severe infusion reactions are often not clear, and in many reported cases, the two designations may be interchangeable.",

There are, however, a number of other classifi cations in the literature. Interestingly, hypersensitivity pneumonitis to some anticancer agents is increasingly looking like a combined type III and type IV hypersensitivity reaction in a Th1/Th17 response. Table 3 .3 lists the mAbs used in cancer therapies that have been implicated in pulmonary adverse reactions. At least ten of the currently approved mAbs for cancer therapy have some recorded pulmonary toxicity in treated cancer patients. Once again, rituximab is the main offender inducing a wide range of adverse events with BOOP most often seen followed by interstitial pneumonitis, ARDS, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It has been suggested that early onset organizing pneumonia is a hypersensitivity reaction to the mAb, whereas the late onset condition is either related to mAb toxicity or to immune system restoration. ARDS symptoms appearing within a few hours of infusion may be a manifestation of CRS or TLS with no relationship to hypersensitivity although ARDS has also been linked to the release of proinfl ammatory cytokines. The incidence of rituximab-associated interstitial lung disease has been estimated to be 0.01-0.03 %. Its pathogenesis remains largely unknown although complement and TNF may be involved.

Lymphopenia, reported in up to 14 % of patients, is reversible. Cutaneous reactions of rash, erythema, pruritus, and catheter-related reactions (erythema and infection) can be serious. Both human anti-mouse and human anti-rat antibodies are seen. \u2022 Blinatumomab ( Blincyto \u00ae ), a bispecifi c T-cell-engaging (BiTE) fusion protein, is composed of two antibody single-chain variable fragments each from an H and L chain. One of the two binding specifi cities is directed to the B-cell antigen CD19, while the other targets CD3, part of the T-cell receptor. Reaction with both antigens is exploited to link malignant B cells of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia to cytotoxic T cells, activating them to destroy the tumor cells. \u2022 Blinatumomab approved by the FDA is issued with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Neurological toxicities range from confusion to tremors, convulsions, and speech disorders but appear to be reversible. CRS, sometimes life-threatening or even fatal, has been reported in up to 11 % of patients and may lead to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. \u2022 CD20 is expressed on the surface of B cells, except for plasmablasts, at all stages of their development. It also occurs on B-cell lymphomas, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and melanoma cancer stem cells. Due to its non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) B-cell expression and the fact that it is not normally shed from cells and is internalized after binding to antibody, CD20 has been seen as an exploitable target for mAbs for the treatment of lymphomas. Four mAbs directed to CD20 are currently approved as antitumor agents-rituximab, ibritumomab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab. \u2022 Rituximab ( MabThera \u00ae , Rituxan \u00ae ), a human-mouse chimeric IgG1\u03ba antibody, was the fi rst mAb approved to treat relapsed or refractory NHL and the fi rst mAb approved specifi cally for cancer therapy. It is now a fi rst-line therapy for several NHLs, including follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In 2002, the FDA authorized the use of rituximab as a component of ibritumomab therapy. \u2022 A long list of side effects has been reported for rituximab ranging from the serious events detailed in an FDA black box warning, namely, infusion reactions, PML, TLS, and severe mucocutaneous reactions (all potentially fatal). Other adverse events are infections, hepatitis B reactivation, cardiac arrhythmias, lung toxicities, and bowel problems plus a host of often less serious systemic and cutaneous events and toxicities. \u2022 Infusion reactions to rituximab occur on the fi rst infusion in up to 77 % of malignant patients and this decreases to approximately 10 % after the second infusion. Lymphocyte counts suggest that the appearance of CRS correlates with counts higher than 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L. \u2022 Postmarketing surveillance of rituximab administration has confi rmed the importance of infections and respiratory and hematologic events in its safety profi le. A 2010 report of the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring Adverse Event Data Bank revealed that rituximab was responsible for 114 of 182 cases of the JC virus-induced PML. \u2022 Ibritumomab tiuxetan ( Zevalin \u00ae ), a murine mAb covalently linked to the chelator tiuxetan by a stable thiourea bond, is radiolabeled with yttrium-90 for therapy or indium-111 for imaging. A boxed warning highlights severe, and potentially fatal, infusion reactions and severe cytopenias as the most serious adverse events experienced with ibritumomab therapy. \u2022 Other serious events following ibritumomab tiuxetan are infections and potentially fatal myeloid malignancies or dysplasias. Hypersensitivity reactions, generally manifesting as bronchospasm or angioedema, are another potentially dangerous side effect. Of the non-hematologic events, gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly seen as well as rare toxidermias such as bullous dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. \u2022 The possibility of hepatitis B virus reactivation, cytopenias, intestinal obstruction, and PML comprise the warnings, precautions, and risks issued for ofatumumab ( Arzerra \u00ae ). Prolonged severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may occur, making necessary the regular monitoring of blood and platelet counts. \u2022 Although exhibiting less CDC than rituximab, obinutuzumab ( Gazyva \u00ae , Gazyvaro \u00ae ) has demonstrated superior effi cacy. Patients with CLL and coexisting illnesses unable to tolerate combined intravenous chemotherapy are likely to be more tolerant of obinutuzumab in its approved indication of the mAb's combination with chlorambucil. \u2022 Grade 3-4 neutropenia, infusion reactions, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, and musculoskeletal pain are the most common events induced by obinutuzumab. In addition to a boxed warning for hepatitis B virus reactivation and PML, warnings and precautions cover severe and life-threatening infusion reactions, TLS, the risk of infections, and cytopenias. \u2022 Brentuximab vedotin ( Adcetris \u00ae ) is a chimeric mAb conjugated to the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and targeted to CD30 which is overexpressed in Hodgkin lymphoma and some other lymphomas. After binding to cells expressing CD30, brentuximab's toxic payload MMAE is internalized. After reaching the lysosomes, MMAE is released, disrupting microtubules and ultimately inducing apoptosis.",

Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis constitute two other serious adverse events that, although rare, are potentially lethal. \u2022 Alemtuzumab ( Campath \u00ae , MabCampath \u00ae ), a humanized mAb with complementarity-determining regions from a rat mAb, is targeted to CD52 which is expressed on mature normal and malignant B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, a subpopulation of granulocytes, and dendritic cells. \u2022 Approved for the treatment of B-cell CLL resistant to alkylating agents, alemtuzumab was widely used in cancer therapy until 2012 when it was withdrawn from US and European markets. Patients can still receive it through specific access programs and some off-label usage in cancer therapy remains. \u2022 Cytopenia, resulting from alemtuzumab's mode of action in destroying white blood cells, is also the major adverse event, hence the FDA boxed warning. As well as a high incidence of neutropenia (75-85 %), febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (serious in 57 % of cases) may occur. Infections related to alemtuzumab therapy have been reported with incidences of up to 80 % and serious events as high as 50 %. \u2022 The destruction of T cells by alemtuzumab can lead to CRS, and potentially nephrotoxic TLS may occur as a result of the rapid and massive destruction of neoplastic cells. Infusion reactions to alemtuzumab occur most commonly during the fi rst week of treatment. Serious reactions can be fatal. \u2022 In a number of different tumors, EGFR and its ligands are associated with the growth of the cells, and elevated EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is found in many, if not most, solid tumors including breast, renal, head and neck, colon, and non-small cell lung cancer. Anti -EGFR mAbs such as cetuximab bind to the EGFR with higher affi nity than the natural ligands, preventing subsequent activation of tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the EGFR were therefore seen as a new approach for treating a range of solid tumors. \u2022 Patients with mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene almost never benefi t from cetuximab and panitumumab treatments, but 10-30 % of patients with the wild-type gene respond to the mAbs. As a result, regulatory agencies restricted the use of cetuximab and panitumumab to colorectal cancer patients expressing the wild-type KRAS gene. \u2022 Serious infusion reactions and the possibility of cardiopulmonary arrest make up an FDA black box warning for cetuximab ( Erbitux \u00ae ). The severity and risk of many of the infusion reactions are underlined by the rapid onset of symptoms of airway obstruction and other serious effects. Cardiopulmonary arrest and/or sudden death, the second subject of the boxed warning, occurred in 2-3 % of patients treated with cetuximab. \u2022 Other warnings and precautions for cetuximab are for the possibility of interstitial lung disease; a variety of dermatologic events, for example, papulopustular rash (with an incidence of 76-88 %, up to 17 % serious); xerosis and fi ssuring; paronychial infl ammation; hypertrichosis; infectious sequelae such as cellulitis and conjunctivitis; and hypomagnesemia and electrolyte abnormalities. \u2022 Panitumumab ( Vectibix \u00ae ) binds the EGFR with high affi nity. The antigenic structures recognized by cetuximab and panitumumab are not identical. This conclusion is supported by effective treatment with panitumumab of patients with disease progression under cetuximab and the development of resistance to cetuximab in a colorectal cancer patient who acquired a point mutation in the EGFR domain (Arg for Ser at position 468), while panitumumab binding and effi cacy remained. \u2022 At the fi rst approval of panitumumab in 2006, the FDA issued a black box warning for dermatologic toxicity and infusion reactions. In the revised prescribing information issued in 2014, reference to infusion reactions in the boxed warning was removed, and dermatologic toxicities were stated to be severe in 15 % of patients. \u2022 Mucocutaneous diseases provoked by panitumumab contribute to an extensive range of clinical manifestations including erythema, rash, pruritus, skin exfoliation, acneiform dermatitis, xerosis, paronychia, and skin fi ssures as well as life-threatening infectious complications such as necrotizing fasciitis and abscesses. Life-threatening bullous mucocutaneous diseases with erosions, blisters, and skin sloughing following panitumumab are known. \u2022 Other warnings and precautions for panitumumab are for severe, including fatal, infusion reactions; severe hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia; acute renal failure resulting from severe diarrhea and dehydration when panitumumab is used in combination with chemotherapy; interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fi brosis; ocular toxicities such as keratitis and ulcerative keratitis; dermatologic toxicities caused by sunlight exposure; and the possibility of increased toxicity and mortality when panitumumab is administered in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. \u2022 Necitumumab ( Portrazza \u00ae ) is a recombinant human mAb targeted to human EGFR. Indicated for fi rst-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin, necitumumab carries FDA black box warnings for cardiopulmonary arrest and/or sudden death and for hypomagnesemia. \u2022 Five other warnings/precautions issued for necitumumab are the possible occurrence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events; some fatal, infusion-related reactions; embryofetal toxicity; increased toxicity and mortality in patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer treated with the mAb plus pemetrexed and cisplatin; and dermatologic toxicities. \u2022 Bevacizumab ( Avastin \u00ae ) binds to and inhibits the biological action of human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). As well as its function of pro-moting blood vessel formation in healthy subjects, VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis has a major role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human diseases, for example, cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, and eye diseases. \u2022 The relatively wide variety of tumors (about 30, including investigative and preliminary studies) treated by bevacizumab ensures a large number and variety of consequent adverse events. An extensive list of warnings and precautions is headed by a boxed warning for gastrointestinal perforation, complications of surgery and wound healing, and severe or fatal hemorrhage. Other serious adverse events seen are hypertension, arterial and venous thromboembolic events, proteinuria, PRES (<0.5 %), and anaphylaxis. \u2022 Ramucirumab ( Cyramza \u00ae ) specifi cally binds VEGFR-2, the receptormediating angiogenesis, a major contributor, if not promoter, of tumor growth. \u2022 Ramucirumab carries an FDA boxed warning for an increased risk of hemorrhage (including gastrointestinal hemorrhage that may be severe and sometimes fatal), gastrointestinal perforation, and impaired wound healing. Other warnings are for serious and sometimes fatal arterial thrombotic events including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular accident, and cerebral ischemia; infusion-related reactions, usually during or following the fi rst or second infusion; PRES; proteinuria including nephrotic syndrome; thyroid dysfunction; and the risk of deterioration in patients with cirrhosis. \u2022 Overexpression of HER2 leads to constitutive activation of the growth factor signaling pathways with a consequent favorable environment for breast cancer cell growth. Overexpression, found in ~15-25 to 30 % of human breast cancers, tends to correlate with tumors that are more aggressive and show poorer prognosis. Three mAbs targeting HER2 are currently approved by the FDA and EMA, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and the antibody-drug conjugate prepared by conjugating trastuzumab to the cytotoxin, mertansine. \u2022 Although pertuzumab ( Perjeta \u00ae ) and trastuzumab ( Herceptin \u00ae ) target the same receptor, they recognize different binding sites. Trastuzumab inhibits ligand-independent signaling, complementing the mechanism of action of pertuzumab which inhibits ligand-dependent signaling between HER2 and HER3, a combination that potently activates cell survival and proliferation. The effi cacy of pertuzumab alone is not impressive, but, together with trastuzumab, a more effective blockade of the HER2-driven signaling pathways results. \u2022 There is an FDA boxed warning for pertuzumab for cardiomyopathy manifesting as congestive heart failure and decreased LVEF and for embryofetal toxicity that may result in fetal death and birth defects. Patients who have received prior treatment with anthracyclines or prior radiotherapy to the chest may be at higher risk of decreased LVEF. Infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity responses including anaphylaxis are also the subject of a warning. \u2022 Pertuzumab, given as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic agents or trastuzumab, shows a low incidence of cardiac dysfunction similar to trastuzumab. Patients experience relatively low incidences of both LVSD and symptomatic heart failure. There was no signifi cant increase in cardiac side effects when pertuzumab was given in combination with other anticancer agents. No synergistic effect between pertuzumab and trastuzumab is apparent. \u2022 Trastuzumab was the fi rst biological agent developed and approved for the treatment of breast cancer, but only about 30 % of patients with advanced disease benefi t from monotherapy with the drug. A large proportion of patients (~70 %) who experience an initial benefi cial response become resistant within a year. \u2022 Cross-signaling is a potential mechanism of trastuzumab resistance. Several molecules appear to activate HER2 in the presence of trastuzumab including insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor Met, growth differentiation factor 15, and members of the ErbB family. The precise mechanisms underlying such cross-signaling generally remain unclear. \u2022 Trastuzumab is the subject of a boxed warning for cardiomyopathy, infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity. For patients receiving trastuzumab as a single agent or in combination therapy, there is a four-to sixfold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction. Incidences are highest when an anthracycline drug is coadministered. Trastuzumab therapy can result in cases of left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, hypertension, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, and cardiac death. Trastuzumab may have a direct effect on myocytes. \u2022 Other warnings and precautions for trastuzumab refer to exacerbation of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and febrile neutropenia and the possibility of fetal harm with an increased risk of oligohydramnios during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. \u2022 Adotrastuzumab emtansine ( Kadcyla \u00ae ) is an ADC made by covalently coupling the microtubule inhibitory compound mertansine (DM1), a cytotoxic, thiol-containing maytansinoid, to trastuzumab via a bifunctional cross-linker. DM1 inhibits the assembly of microtubules leading to cell cycle arrest and ultimately cancer cell death. \u2022 An FDA black box warning for ado-trastuzumab emtansine mentions hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity (specifi cally reduction in LVEF), and the potential risk of fetal harm, plus a reminder that the ADC should not be substituted for, or by, trastuzumab. Warnings and precautions have been issued for pulmonary toxicity, infusion and hypersensitivity reactions, thrombocytopenia, neurotoxicity, and extravasation. \u2022 Denosumab ( Xgeva \u00ae , Prolia \u00ae ) has high specifi city and affi nity for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, otherwise known as RANKL. Responsible for bone resorption, RANKL stimulates osteoclast formation, activation, adherence, survival, and ultimately resorption of the bone. Inhibition of RANKL results in an increase in bone density, volume, and strength. \u2022 Marketed under two trade names, denosumab as Prolia \u00ae has approved cancer indications for the treatment of men at high risk of fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer and for the treatment of women at high risk of fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer. As Xgeva \u00ae , denosumab is approved for the prevention of skeletalrelated events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and the treatment of giant cell tumor of the bone. \u2022 For Xgeva \u00ae , warnings and precautions consist of hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and embryofetal toxicity. For Prolia \u00ae , hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, is listed as a warning together with hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, serious infections, femoral fractures and suppression of bone turnover, cutaneous reactions, and severe bone, joint, and muscle pain. \u2022 Recent serious postmarketing surveillance reports for Xgeva \u00ae cover calcium and bone disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms, and musculoskeletal and dermatologic conditions; these events, plus respiratory disorders, are also the most commonly reported reactions. Reports on Prolia \u00ae relate to musculoskeletal disorders, dermatologic conditions, infections, and gastrointestinal disorders. The most frequently mentioned infections include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. \u2022 Ipilimumab ( Yervoy \u00ae ) binds with high affi nity to the extracellular domain of the protein receptor human cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 or CTLA-4. When bound to the B7 complex on APCs, CTLA-4 acts as an immune \"off\" switch modulating overactivity of T cells and allowing cancer cells to multiply in the absence of an antitumor challenge. This led to the development of ipilimumab, the fi rst mAb example of immune checkpoint targeting. \u2022 A number of adverse events induced by ipilimumab are related to the mAb's mode of action of T-cell-mediated immune aggression against cancer cells. These events are refl ected in a boxed warning for immune-mediated reactions including enterocolitis, hepatitis, neuropathy, endocrinopathy, severe cutaneous events such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, and a number of immune-mediated ocular manifestations. \u2022 Siltuximab ( Sylvant \u00ae ) targets interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinfl ammatory and anti-infl ammatory pleiotropic cytokine produced by many different cells including lymphocytes, monocytes, fi broblasts, and endothelial and cancer cells. Cancers associated with increased production of IL-6 include renal cell carcinoma, prostate and bladder cancers, some neurologic cancers, and particularly multiple myeloma and the B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, Castleman's disease. \u2022 Siltuximab is approved for the treatment of multicentric Castleman's disease in patients who are HIV and HHV-8 negative. Warnings and precautions mention the possibility of siltuximab masking signs of acute infl ammation and suppressing fever and acute phase reactants such as CRP. By extension, live vaccines should not be administered concurrently or within four weeks of commencing siltuximab therapy. Other issued warnings are for infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity and gastrointestinal perforation. An increased risk of malignancy and the development of hyperlipidemia and hepatic impairment are additional warnings issued by the EMA.",

            "text": "\u2022 The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor which plays a critical role in cancer immunology acts as another important immune checkpoint. PD-1 is expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B lymphocytes, NK cells, B cells, and monocytes during antigen signaling. PD-1 has two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. High expression of PD-L1 appears to be associated with increased aggressiveness of cancers and death. \u2022 Like CTLA-4, PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation. PD-1 does not interfere with the normal immune response, but, upon binding PD-L1 and PD-L2, signaling is induced, suppressing T-cell proliferation and activity. Malignant cells often express PD-L1 which induces inhibitory signaling preventing expansion of activated T cells and allowing the tumor cells to avoid immune attack. Selectively blocking the pathway with anti-PD-1 antibodies reverses the checkpoint inhibition and restores the T-cellmediated response to the tumor. \u2022 Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda \u00ae ), targeted to PD-1, and indicated for metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, can provoke a number of immune adverse reactions. Warnings have been issued for immune-mediated pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, renal failure, and nephritis. \u2022 Nivolumab ( Opdivo \u00ae ), targeted to PD-1, is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab, and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor should also be given. Other indications are non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. \u2022 Nivolumab is also subject to warnings for immune-mediated adverse events of pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, renal failure, and nephritis in melanoma patients. \u2022 The sialic ganglioside disialoganglioside (GD2), a short sialylated polysaccharide linked to ceramide through a \u03b2-glycosidic linkage, is found highly expressed on neuroectoderm-derived cancers such as neuroblastoma, melanoma, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma in children. Dinutuximab ( Unituxin \u00ae ), a human-mouse chimeric mAb that binds GD2, has been shown to prevent the outgrowth of experimental melanoma and neuroblastoma tumors. \u2022 Approval for dinutuximab comes with a boxed warning for potentially lifethreatening infusion reactions and neuropathy. Severe neuropathic pain and nerve damage requiring prior, and subsequent, intravenous opioid treatment may occur. \u2022 Other warnings issued for dinutuximab are for capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, infection, neurological eye disorders, bone marrow suppression, electrolyte abnormalities, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and embryofetal toxicity. \u2022 Daratumumab ( Darzalex \u00ae ) is the fi rst-in-class immunotherapy for multiple myeloma targeted to CD38 (cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase), a surface antigen expressed by multiple myeloma cells and found on many immune cells including CD4+, CD8+, B lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. The mAb acts by inhibiting the growth of tumor cells expressing CD38, leading to apoptosis by Fc-mediated cross-linking and cell lysis induced via CDC, ADCC, and ADCP.",

            "text": "\u2022 Warnings and precautions for daratumumab are the occurrence of infusion reactions, interference with cross-matching and red blood cell antibody screening, and interference by the mAb when determining patient's response and disease progression in patients with IgG kappa myeloma. As well as infusion reactions, adverse events recorded so far include infections, fatigue, and nausea. It is predicted that postmarketing usage will reveal the occurrence of cytopenias. \u2022 The humanized mAb elotuzumab ( Empliciti \u00ae ), targeting the cell surface receptor CS1 (SLAMF7), a member of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule receptor family, was recently approved for use with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. \u2022 Warnings and precautions associated with elotuzumab include infusion reactions (premedication is required), risk of infections, hepatotoxicity, and malignancies. \u2022 In May 2016 FDA-approval was granted to the PD-L1-targeted mAb atezolizumab (Tecentriq \u2122 ) for treatment of urothelial carcinoma. \u2022 The mAbs approved for cancer therapy show the full range of hypersensitivity responses: type I IgE antibody-mediated immediate reactions such as anaphylaxis, urticaria, and angioedema; type II drug-induced thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and agranulocytosis; type III serum sickness and drug-induced vasculitis; and type IV cutaneous hypersensitivities mediated by Th1, Th2, and Th17 lymphocytes. \u2022 Immunogenicity is always a safety concern for mAbs, even those that are fully humanized since the possibility of generating anti-idiotype antibodies remains. Warnings are often issued for anaphylaxis, but the observed incidences of such reactions are actually quite small. IgE-mediated reactions to chimeric proteins containing mouse and rat sequences are considered to be of greater risk. Anaphylaxis has been reported for, at least, cetuximab, rituximab, brentuximab, bevacizumab, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, ibritumomab, and dinutuximab. \u2022 Cytopenias occur in some patients treated with mAbs during anticancer immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms frequently remain unexplored. Types II and III hypersensitivities induced by mAbs may be underdiagnosed. \u2022 Incidences of 1.1 and 5.2 % for severe anemia have been reported for patients receiving rituximab monotherapy. At least two mAbs, rituximab and alemtuzumab, have been implicated in the induction of pure red cell aplasia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. \u2022 Hypersensitivity vasculitis induced by drugs is a manifestation of a type III response, and a few mAbs including rituximab have been implicated in its cause. Serum sickness reactions to mAbs are probably underdiagnosed and reported. Chimeric antibodies in particular have the potential to induce the reactions. \u2022 Delayed, type IV cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions to anticancer mAbs are rare with most reported cases restricted mainly to ibritumomab tiuxetan, brentuximab vedotin, and rituximab. Mechanisms remain to be established for some type IV-like cutaneous reactions induced by catumaxomab, bevacizumab, denosumab, ipilimumab, and panitumumab. \u2022 The mechanisms of mAb-induced infusion reactions are not yet fully understood. Cytokines, especially TNF and interleukins such as IL-6, may be involved since the symptoms they produce resemble those seen in infusion and type I allergic reactions. An important fi nding was the observation that the severity of infusion reactions is related to the number of circulating lymphocytes. \u2022 Cytokine release syndrome, also called cytokine storm, may be seen after the use of mAbs directed to malignant immune cells, for example, rituximab. \u2022 At least ten of the currently approved mAbs for cancer therapy have some recorded pulmonary toxicity in treated cancer patients. Adverse pulmonary events provoked by mAbs include interstitial pneumonitis and fi brosis, ARDS, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis to some anticancer agents appears to be a combined type III and type IV hypersensitivity reaction in a Th1/Th17 response. \u2022 Cardiac adverse events have occurred with at least 11 of the mAbs used for cancer therapy. \u2022 Cutaneous reactions elicited by mAbs targeted to EGFR are generally not immune-mediated. Skin reactions appear as a papulopustular eruption, often in a large proportion of patients (50-100 %) and in a more severe form than seen with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Eruptions tend to be confi ned to seborrheic regions such as the epidermis, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles. Other adverse effects induced by mAbs targeted to EGFR include paronychia, fi ssures, xerosis, palmar-plantar rash, hair changes, hyperkeratosis, mucositis, pyrogenic granuloma, and skin hyperpigmentation. \u2022 Tumor lysis syndrome usually occurs in patients with leukemias and high-grade lymphomas. Large numbers of malignant cells may be destroyed in a short time by the mAb resulting in hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia. This may produce profound ionic imbalances in potassium, calcium phosphate, and uric acid and progress to acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and death. \u2022 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, caused by the polyomavirus JC virus in severely immunodefi cient individuals, is occasionally seen upon the administration of some mAbs directed to B cells, in particular, rituximab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab, and brentuximab vedotin.",
