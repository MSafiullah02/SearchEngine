As of May 2020, industry, government, and academia from each country are cooperating to take measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 infection and develop therapeutic drugs. This is the third time in this century that humans have been threatened by corona virus. The first was SARS in 2003, the second was MERS in 2012, and the third is COVID-19. Comparing SARS and MERS with COVID-19, it can be said that computer science including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has made great progress. In fact, many computer science approaches have been developed to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 infection. For example, AI and ML are used for infection spreading analysis, drug discovery assistance, automatic diagnosis, diagnosis assistance, social trend analysis, and infection route analysis. This paper proposes an ML technology for infection spreading analysis. To be more specific, we input the number of COVID-19 infection cases per day and other related information in each of 17 provinces in South Korea for the last 24 days, and output the total increase in the number of infection cases in each of 17 provinces over the coming 24 days. The result of conducting binary classification whether the total number of COVID-19 infection cases exceeds 100 over coming 24 days is Sensitivity = 3/3 = 100%, Specificity = 11/14 = 78.6%, False Positive Rate = 3 / 11 = 21.4%, Accuracy = 14/17 = 82.4%.",
