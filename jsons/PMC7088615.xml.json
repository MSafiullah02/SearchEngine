One day before visiting the hospital, he had fever again, dizziness and headache, the four limbs ache, but no cough, shivering, chest tightness, chest pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Recently, the patient traveled from Wuhan to Kunming. He denied medical history of hepatitis, tuberculosis, typhia, contacting with poultry and mosquito bites. He was hospitalized in our hospital on January 21 2020, and still had fever after admission, with the highest temperature of 39.2 \u2103. Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR was positive. The possibility of combined infection with other pathogens were microbiologically excluded. CT features of the case are similar to the case report by Lei [1] and a large series by Pan et al. [2] (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "COVID-19 pneumonia is infected by seventh known coronaviruses, named 2019-nCoV. 2019-ncov is a kind of virus which has homologous recombination between bat coronavirus and unknown source coronavirus. Its recombination takes place in spike protein S, which can recognize cell surface receptors, and get into cells to proliferation by membrane fusion [3]. Fever is the main clinical symptom of COVID-19 pneumonia patients, followed by dry cough, muscle ache or fatigue. Besides these, headache, and hemoptysis and diarrhea may occur in some cases. The incubation is required in some patients, and it takes about 7\u201310 days, and the severe patients can progress to ARDS [4]. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are the same as the common upper respiratory tract infection, but the chest CT has certain specificity [1, 2]. As medical evidence, CT diagnosis was written in \u201cDiagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Infected by 2019-nCoV (trial implementation 5th Edition)\u201d published by National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China [5]. However, it is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia on CT findings alone. It is still necessary to clear and definite the epidemiological history, and it should be diagnosed by real-time RT-PCR. There is no specific drug for the treatment of NCP patients. Based on past experience in the treatment of SARS and MERS, some antiviral drugs such as Lopinavir and Ritonavir may play a positive effect in the treatment of NCP patients, while the curative effect still needs further research [6].",
