We estimate the value of disease avoidance using an epidemiological model that projects the spread of COVID-19 across rich and poor countries. Social distancing measures that \"flatten the curve\" of the disease to bring demand within the capacity of healthcare systems are predicted to save many lives in high-income countries, such that practically any economic cost is worth bearing. These social distancing policies are estimated to be less effective in poor countries with younger populations less susceptible to COVID-19, and more limited healthcare systems, which were overwhelmed before the pandemic. Moreover, social distancing lowers disease risk by limiting people's economic opportunities. Poorer people are less willing to make those economic sacrifices. They place relatively greater value on their livelihood concerns compared to contracting COVID-19. Not only are the epidemiological and economic benefits of social distancing much smaller in poorer countries, such policies may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the informal sector lack the resources and social protections to isolate themselves and sacrifice economic opportunities until the virus passes. By limiting their ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger, deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity. Rather than a blanket adoption of social distancing measures, we advocate for the exploration of alternative harm-reduction strategies, including universal mask adoption and increased hygiene measures.",

            "text": "The purpose of this note is to quantitatively explore whether similar mitigation and suppression strategies are equally valuable in low and middle income countries. There are a number of demographic and infrastructural reasons why the costs of COVID-19 and the benefits to social distancing may vary with the income level of a country. There is a greater prevalence of comorbidities and endemic disease in poor countries, such as malnutrition and tuberculosis, which may negatively interact with COVID-19 infection. The healthcare systems in poor countries have few hospital beds and ventilators per capita, and are predicted to be unable to absorb a rapid influx of patients. This means, however, that flattening the curve of the disease to fall within the capacity of the healthcare system may not be feasible, no matter the extent of the lockdown or mitigation efforts employed. Many more workers in poor countries are self-employed or in the informal sector and depend on daily wages to feed their families. In the absence of strong social protection and insurance, the cost imposed by social (and economic) distancing may be large in terms of immediate deprivation and hunger. As a result compliance rates with lock-down orders or social distancing guidelines may be lower in countries with weaker enforcement capacity. Most importantly however, the high average age in rich countries drives the predicted high mortality from the unmitigated spread of COVID-19, while the younger population in low-income yields a much lower predicted mortality risk.",

            "text": "To determine the relative value of suppression strategies in rich versus poor countries, we embed estimates of the country-specific costs of mortality developed by Viscusi and Masterman (2017) into the influential epidemiological model developed by the the Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team that predicts mortality from the spread of the virus (Ferguson et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Greenstone and Nigam (2020) adapt this model to assign an economic value to COVID-19 mortality in the United States. They predict that social distancing measures will save 1.76 million lives (both directly, and indirectly by reducing hospital overcrowding), with a total welfare value of 7.9 trillion dollars. Widespread social distancing and stay-at-home orders may create economic hardship in the United States, but this leaves no room for debate about the value of this public health intervention. We conduct a similar exercise for all rich and poor countries to explore whether such a policy prescription applies uniformly, or whether more nuanced thinking, analysis, and strategizing is required in the case of low-income countries. Walker et al. (2020) predicts COVID-19 from all countries across the five policy scenarios using a base R0 value of 3.0. This includes predictions for an unmitigated epidemic, where the government takes no action to limit the spread of COVID, and social distancing measures. Walker et al. predict the mortality impact of a uniform 45% reduction in interpersonal contact rates within a country (social distancing), and social distancing with enhanced targeting of individuals over the age of 70 who further reduce their contact rates by 60% (social distancing+). The authors also consider suppression strategies, defined by more a intensive social distancing involve a 75% reduction in interpersonal contact rates, triggered late into the spread of COVID-19, at 1.6 deaths per 100,000 people per week, or relatively early, at 0.2 deaths per 100,000 people per week. Figure 1 shows the predicted average mortality from COVID-19 for a set of countries and regions as well as distribution of the percentage of the population above the age of 65 by World Bank income classification. Richer regions, where the population skews older, risk losing more lives in an unmitigated outbreak. Predicted population level mortality rates are just below 0.8% in the United States as in other OECD economies. 1 Countries and regions with younger populations, such as Bangladesh and Sub-Saharan Africa, face much lower risk, with the unmitigated spread of COVID-19 leading to predicted mortality rates of 0.39% and 0.21%, respectively. This is despite the comparatively poor health system capacity in poorer countries (proxied by hospital beds per capita) incorporated into the Imperial College model. The right panel of the figure explains why.",

The VSL is based on how people trade off the risk of harm and economic reward. Individuals face mortality risks, whether from disease or as a result of their occupation, and individuals may accept these risks willingly when appropriately compensated. A recent example is the strike by Instacart workers in the United States during this pandemic, who are demanding an additional $5 in hazard pay per order as compensation for their increased exposure to the disease (Olson and Anderson, 2020) . The VSL adds up these probabilistic risks to estimate the monetary value that people in a given country assign to saving one of these statistical lives. The VSL is not a measure of the economic productivity that a person provides, but rather how society as a whole assigns value to saving a life. unambiguously large. This is due to higher predicted mortality rates in the United States relative to other countries and the higher base VSL. In comparison to U.S. losses, the dollar costs of uncontrolled COVID-19 in large countries such as Pakistan or Nigeria look minuscule.

The second important lesson from Figure 3 is that moving from a policy of doing nothing to imposing social distancing yields a very large welfare improvement in rich countries: Equivalent to 59% of U.S. GDP. However, the same policy of social distancing increases estimated welfare in Bangladesh by only 14% of its own lower GDP. Imposing more suppressive policies in the United States yield additional increases in welfare equivalent to 42% of its GDP, while moving from social distancing to suppression in Bangladesh only increases welfare by an additional 19% of its own (lower) GDP.

First, in poor countries there are fewer old people to who can benefit from targeted distancing. Further, the elderly often reside with younger family members, so contact rates can only be reduced within limits. Second, the relatively low hospital and ICU capacity at baseline in poorer countries means that flattening the mortality curve is unlikely to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. Third, the opportunity cost of social distancing is larger in poorer countries, and the VSL is therefore lower. Simply put, rich people can more easily meet their basic needs while social distancing, while a poor person may need to prioritize income-generating opportunities to put food on their family's table.",

That people in poor countries accept greater risks for lower compensation, leading to a lower estimate of their VSL, may be due to necessity rather than choice. Moreover, the VSL is estimated using very small changes in the relative risk of dying, on the order of 1:10,000. The different COVID-19 mitigation scenarios under consideration shift estimated mortality rates more drastically: two to three orders of magnitude larger. For example, moving from no mitigation to social distancing in Bangladesh reduces average risk by 1:1,000, and moving from social distancing to late suppression reduces average risk by a similar amount. It is unclear whether it is appropriate to extrapolate the VSL, estimated from small increases in relative risk, to the much larger risks from COVID-19.

A policy response is necessary, the benefits to each policy must be carefully weighed against the economic cost and risks imposed on that society. The most widely-cited model of COVID-19 transmission and mortality shows that we should expect fewer deaths in poor countries, and that social distancing policies in these countries produce smaller benefits. Much of this result is based on differences in the age distribution across countries, because our present understanding is that COVID-19 mortality risk increases dramatically with age. It is uncertain whether this relationship will remain robust in poorer countries where younger people have higher rates of chronic illness and endemic disease. Yet even permitting an overestimate of deaths in rich countries and an underestimate in poor countries, the differences in imputed welfare benefit remain vast. Given the deeper concerns about the risks that economic shutdowns pose on the most vulnerable members of low-income societies (Saleh and Cash, 2020) , it 2 See: Abi-Habib and Yasir (n.d.a,n); BBC (2020); Tewari (2020). Abi-Habib and Yasir (n.d.b) quote one migrant laborer saying: \"You fear the disease, living on the streets. But I fear hunger more, not corona.\" Another migrant construction worker is quoted saying \"I earn 600 rupees every day and I have five people to feed. We will run out of food in a few days. I know the risk of coronavirus, but I can't see my children hungry\" (BBC, 2020). We know that workers in low-income countries are younger and likely less susceptible to COVID-19. We know that workers are also more vulnerable to economic disruption, and may be unable to adhere to lockdown orders. Various government and non-governmental organizations are currently playing an important role to avert outright starvation during the pandemic by providing free meals, food supplies, and fuel to poor households. Supply chains within countries have been disrupted by lockdown measures, making it increasingly difficult to deliver food (Purohit, 2020) . Ray and Subramanian (2020) suggest permitting people under the age of 40 to work during lockdown as a way of mitigating the economic costs to COVID-19 suppression. Indeed, the recent example of India demonstrates our concern about the capacity of states to enforce suppression strategies, and where imperfect compliance may lead to an increase in transmission to other vulnerable populations (Agrawal, 2020) .
