The first version of these guidelines was published in 2007 and they were updated in 2010. The present document provides an updated and expanded version of these international guidelines for the vaccination of small companion animals and indicates the scientific evidence base on which the recommendations are made. The VGG recognises that the keeping of pet small animals is subject to significant variation in practice and associated economics throughout the world and that vaccination recommendations that might apply to a developed country may not be appropriate for a developing country. These guidelines are not a mandatory edict, but rather should be used by national associations and individual veterinary practices to develop vaccination schedules relevant to the local situation. However, the VGG strongly recommends that wherever possible ALL dogs and cats receive the benefit of vaccination. This not only protects the individual animal, but provides optimum \u2018herd immunity\u2019 that minimizes the likelihood of infectious disease outbreaks.",

Categories defining the weight of evidence underlying any procedure in veterinary practice (e.g. medical, surgical or diagnostic procedures or the administration of pharmaceuticals) have been defined and applied previously to European recommendations for feline vaccination (Lloret, 2009). The VGG aimed for the current update of the WSAVA global vaccination guidelines to adopt a more explicitly evidence\u2010based approach, so that practitioners could be made aware of the nature of evidence that underpins the recommendations made. Accordingly, this document is more fully referenced than previous iterations of the guidelines. Additionally, the VGG wished to apply a ranking of supportive evidence, but found that the currently used schemes were poorly applicable to the specialist area of vaccinology. For this reason, the VGG has developed its own EBVM classification, proposing four levels of evidence related to investigations of small companion animal vaccination. These are:",

The DOI is based on experimental evidence (i.e. how long after vaccination is an animal protected from infection or disease as determined by challenge with virulent infectious agent), represents a minimum value and need not reflect the true DOI of a vaccine. Most companion animal core vaccines, until relatively recently, had a 1\u2010year minimum DOI and carried a recommendation for annual revaccination. In more recent years many of the same products have been licensed with a minimum DOI of 3 (or sometimes 4) years. In fact, in many countries the majority of core MLV vaccines are now licensed for triennial revaccination of adult animals. However, there are many other countries in which the identical products still carry a 1\u2010year minimum DOI; simply because the manufacturer has not applied for a change in its product label recommendations or because the national licensing authority has not permitted the change to be made. This unfortunate situation does lead to confusion amongst practitioners in those countries. Above all, it must be remembered that even a 3\u2010year license is a minimum DOI for core vaccines and for most core vaccines the true DOI is likely to be considerably longer, if not lifelong, for the majority of vaccine recipients.",

There is little doubt that, in most developed countries, some of the major infectious diseases of dogs and cats are considered at most uncommon in the pet population. However, even in those countries there remain geographical pockets of infection and sporadic outbreaks of disease may occur, and the situation regarding free\u2010roaming or shelter populations is distinctly different from that in owned pet animals. In many developing countries these key infectious diseases remain as common as they once were in developed nations and a major cause of mortality in small animals. Although it is difficult to obtain accurate figures, even in developed countries it is estimated that only 30\u201350% of the pet animal population is vaccinated, and this is significantly less in developing nations. The global economic recession post\u20102008 has had further impact on the uptake of preventive healthcare by pet owners in developed countries and survey data suggests a recent decline in vaccination (Anon 2013a).",

Herd immunity related to use of core vaccines that provide a long (many years) DOI is highly dependent on the percentage of animals in the population vaccinated and not the number of vaccinations that occur annually. Therefore, every effort should be made to vaccinate a higher percentage of cats and dogs with the core vaccines. It is simply not possible to induce \u2018better\u2019 immunity in an individual animal by giving repeated vaccinations, i.e. a dog receiving a core MLV vaccine every 3 years will be equally well protected compared with one receiving the same vaccine annually (Bohm et al.\n2004, Mouzin et al.\n2004, Mitchell et al.\n2012) [EB1], but this may not necessarily be the case for feline core vaccines (see below).",

To an extent this categorization of products has been based on available scientific evidence and personal experience \u2013 but concerted effort to introduce effective companion animal disease surveillance on a global scale would provide a more definitive basis on which to recommend vaccine usage (Day et al.\n2012). In parallel with the categorization of vaccines has been the push towards marketing products with extended DOI, to reduce the unnecessary administration of vaccines and thereby further improve vaccine safety.

The rationale behind this protocol is to permit \u2018early socialization\u2019 of puppies while diminishing the risk of infectious diseases. The VGG recognizes that early socialization is essential to the behavioural development of dogs (Korbelik et al.\n2011, AVSAB 2008) [EB1]. Where such protocols (i.e. \u2018puppy classes\u2019) are adopted, vigilance should still be maintained by the owner \u2013 allowing restricted exposure of their puppy to controlled areas and only to other puppies and adults that appear healthy and are fully vaccinated. In particular \u2018puppy classes\u2019 should be held in venues away from the veterinary practice. Alternatively, if it is decided that veterinary premises must be used, the floors should be cleaned and disinfected before each class and the classes held in an area not highly trafficked by dogs of unknown vaccination or disease status. A recent US study has shown the minimal risk for CPV\u20102 amongst vaccinated puppies attending socialization classes (Stepita et al.\n2013). The VGG recommends that whenever possible the last of the puppy primary series of core vaccines be given at 16 weeks of age or older [EB1].",

The main aim of this vaccine is to ensure that a protective immune response develops in any dog that may have failed to respond to any of the vaccines in the primary core series, rather than necessarily \u2018boosting\u2019 the immune response. The delivery of this vaccine at 12 months of age is likely to have been chosen historically as a convenient time to request the owner to attend the practice for a first annual health check. This therefore implies that should an individual puppy fail to respond to any of the primary core vaccinations, that puppy may be unprotected until it receives this 12\u2010month vaccine. This might account for occurrences of infectious disease (e.g. canine parvoviral enteritis) in a proportion of vaccinated puppies at less than 12 months of age. The VGG has re\u2010evaluated this practice and now suggests that veterinarians might wish to reduce this possible window of susceptibility by bringing forward this vaccine from 52 weeks to 26 weeks of age (or indeed at any time point between 26 and 52 weeks of age; however, 26 weeks of age provides a convenient timing). This practice will require that pet owners clearly understand why this is recommended, because as indicated in Table 5, adopting such a protocol will mean that vaccination started in a 6 or 7 week old puppy, might now entail up to five vaccine visits in the first 6 months of life. For core vaccines, after a 26 week \u2018booster\u2019, another core vaccine would not be required for at least another 3 years. This new recommendation for vaccination at 6 months of age as an alternative to vaccination at about 1 year of age is certainly not mutually exclusive to, and does not preclude, a 1\u2010year or 16\u2010month \u2018first annual health check\u2019. Many veterinarians are understandably keen to check the animals under their care at around the time they reach skeletal maturity.",

It is believed (but unproven) that the high susceptibility to CPV\u20102 recognized in certain Rottweilers and Dobermanns during the 1980s (regardless of their vaccination history) relates in part to a high prevalence of non\u2010responders (Houston et al. 1994) [EB4].

Some dogs of these breeds may be low or non\u2010responders to other antigens. For example, in the UK and Germany, the non\u2010responder phenotype remains prevalent amongst Rottweilers [EB3] for CPV\u20102 and recent studies have shown this breed to have a higher proportion of animals failing to achieve the titre of rabies antibody required for pet travel (Kennedy et al.\n2007) [EB1].

However, this work has been criticised because only a small volume (12 ml) of immune plasma was given to each puppy in this study. Much larger volumes (6 \u00b7 6\u201311 ml/kg) are routinely used by researchers and practitioners and these large doses are believed by some experienced clinicians and investigators to have efficacy (Dodds 2012) [EB4]. In order to have a maximal beneficial effect, immune serum or plasma must be given after infection, but prior to the onset of clinical signs. In this case administration of immune serum or plasma is best provided within 24\u201348 hours after infection and a large amount of high titred serum or plasma is required. The serum or plasma must be given parenterally (e.g. subcutaneously, intravenously or intraperitoneally) and not orally. There is no benefit from oral administration even when treatment is started prior to infection.",

Thus the feline core respiratory disease vaccines should not be expected to give the same robust protection, nor the duration of immunity, that is seen with canine core vaccines. FCV vaccines have been designed to produce cross\u2010protective immunity against multiple strains of FCV; however, it is still possible for infection and disease to occur in vaccinated adult animals (Pedersen et al.\n2000, Schorr\u2010Evans et al.\n2003) [EB1]. There is no FHV\u20101 vaccine that can protect against infection with virulent virus and infection may lead to the virulent virus becoming latent with the possibility of reactivation during periods of severe stress (Richter et al.\n2009, Maes 2012) [EB1]. The reactivated virus may cause clinical signs in the vaccinated animal or the virus can be shed to susceptible animals and cause disease in them. The VGG recommends triennial revaccination of low\u2010risk cats for FHV\u20101 and FCV on the basis of a published study showing a minimum duration of partial, but clinically significant, immunity of 7.5 years for these core vaccines (Scott & Geissinger 1999). A more recent study of a MLV FHV\u20101/FCV vaccine seemed to show much less substantial, partial protection against FHV\u20101 at 3 years post vaccination; although the FCV partial protection was comparable to that shown by Scott and Geissinger in1999 (Jas et al.\n2015). [EB1]. The VGG recommends that annual revaccination of cats against FHV\u20101/FCV be carried out in higher\u2010risk situations. A low\u2010risk cat might be defined as a solitary, indoor animal that does not visit a boarding cattery. A higher\u2010risk cat might be defined as an animal that regularly visits a boarding cattery or that lives in a multicat, indoor\u2013outdoor household. Moreover, the VGG encourages practitioners to consider the timing of administration of FHV\u20101/FCV vaccines to higher\u2010risk, regularly boarding cats. The most robust immunity conferred by these vaccines occurs within the 3\u2010month period after vaccination (Gaskell et al.\n2007) [EB1], and so administration of these vaccines might best be timed for immediately before a regularly boarded cat is due to make an annual visit to the cattery.",

The VGG is aware that in some parts of the world, there remains a significant prevalence of FIV seropositivity and/or infection (Bennett et al.\n1989, Hosie et al.\n1989, Friend et al.\n1990, Glennon et al.\n1991, Bandecchi et al.\n1992, Hitt et al.\n1992, Ueland and Lutz 1992, Jones et al.\n1995, Hofmann\u2010Lehmann et al.\n1996, Yilmaz et al.\n2000, Lee et al.\n2002, Muirden 2002, Norris et al.\n2007, Gleich et al.\n2009, Ravi et al.\n2010, Bande et al.\n2012, Chang Fung Martel et al.\n2013, Rypula et al.\n2014) [EB1]. There are now discriminatory serological tests (Kusuhara et al.\n2007, Levy et al.\n2008, Westman et al.\n2015) and more robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for the diagnosis of FIV infection (Arjona et al.\n2007, Wang et al.\n2010, Morton et al.\n2012) [EB1]. In many countries, it is most unlikely that cat owners will be persuaded to keep their cats indoors, away from the major risk of FIV transmission (bites by infected cats). Disease progression in FIV\u2010infected cats has recently been shown to be impacted by housing conditions and number of cats in the household (Beczkowski et al.\n2015b). Given that this vaccine has been shown to have efficacy in some studies, but not in others, and might benefit some at\u2010risk populations of cats, the VGG has reclassified the product as a non\u2010core vaccine.",

However, without serological testing, the level of protection and the point at which the kitten will become susceptible to infection and can respond immunologically to vaccination are unknown. This is related to the level of maternal antibody and variation in uptake of MDA between litters and individuals. In general, MDA will have waned by 8\u201312 weeks of age to a level that allows an active immunological response; however, kittens with poor MDA may be vulnerable (and capable of responding to vaccination) at an earlier age, while others may possess MDA at such high titres that they are incapable of responding to vaccination until sometime after 12 weeks of age. The VGG has reviewed recent studies suggesting that up to one third of kittens may fail to respond to a final core vaccine given at 16 weeks of age and that a proportion of kittens may still have blocking MDA at 20 weeks of age (DiGangi et al.\n2012, Jakel et al.\n2012). The VGG notes that one of these studies was of a relatively low number of animals, dominated by one breed, within a cattery setting, and suggests that the data may not be fully applicable to the wider feline population. Nevertheless, the VGG has increased the recommended age for the final vaccination in the series of primary core vaccinations from 14\u201316 weeks of age to 16 weeks or older [EB1].",

The main aim of this vaccine is to ensure that a protective immune response develops in any cat that may have failed to respond to any of the three vaccines in the primary core series, rather than necessarily \u2018boosting\u2019 the immune response. The delivery of this vaccine at 12 months of age is likely to have been chosen historically as a convenient time to request the owner to attend the practice for a first annual health check. This therefore implies that should an individual kitten fail to respond to any of the three primary core vaccinations, that kitten may be unprotected until it receives this 12\u2010month vaccine. This might account for occurrences of infectious disease in a proportion of vaccinated kittens at less than 12 months of age. The VGG has re\u2010evaluated this practice and now suggests that veterinarians might wish to reduce this possible window of susceptibility by bringing forward this vaccine from 52 weeks to 26 weeks of age (or indeed at any time point between 26 and 52 weeks of age; however, 26 weeks of age provides a convenient timing). This practice will require that pet owners clearly understand why this is recommended, because as indicated in Table 5, adopting such a protocol will mean that vaccination started in a 6 or 7 week old kitten, might now entail up to five vaccine visits in the first 6 months of life. For core vaccines, after a 26 week \u2018booster\u2019, another core vaccine would not be required for at least another 3 years (for a low\u2010risk cat).

Accordingly the recommendation \u2018left leg leukaemia, right leg rabies\u2019 suggested that FeLV vaccine should be given as far distal as possible into the left hindlimb, whilst rabies vaccine should be given as far distal as possible into the right hindlimb. This recommendation remains in the current AAFP guidelines (Scherk et al.\n2013), which also specify administration of the three feline core vaccines into a distal forelimb. One study evaluated the effect of this practice by comparing the anatomical distribution of FISS in cats before the recommendation was made (1990\u20131996) and after the practice was adopted (1997\u20132006) (Shaw et al.\n2009). The data showed a significant decrease in the prevalence of interscapular FISS and an increase in prevalence of tumours in the right (but not left) forelimb. More notably, there was also an increase in the number of tumours reported arising in the combined regions of the right hindlimb with right lateral aspect of the abdomen (12.5% to 25.0%) and the left hindlimb with left lateral aspect of the abdomen (11.4% to 13.8%). This was attributed to the difficultly of injecting into the distal hindlimb and these abdominal sites being accidentally injected. This practice has not been widely adopted outside of North America.",

Adult cats from a community trap\u2013neuter\u2013return programme were given trivalent MLV core vaccine (FPV, FHV\u20101, FCV) into the distal third of the dorsal tail with inactivated rabies vaccine administered 2 cm distal to the site of the trivalent vaccination. Seroconversion occurred in all cats to FPV and all but one cat for rabies virus. Tail vaccination was reported to be well tolerated by the cats in this small study. In the 2010 WSAVA vaccination guidelines, the VGG proposed the alternative of delivering vaccine into the skin of the lateral thorax, or better, the lateral abdomen (Day et al.\n2010). Tail injection may prove to be a safer alternative than distal limb injections or lateral body wall injections, but further studies of tail vaccination will be required.",

However, the following principles should still be applied:Any risk of FISS is outweighed by the benefit of protective immunity conferred by vaccines. Current estimates of the prevalence of FISS are 1 in every 5,000 to 12,500 cats vaccinated (Gobar and Kass 2002, Dean et al.\n2013).Non\u2010adjuvanted vaccines should be administered to cats wherever possible.Vaccines (particularly adjuvanted products) or other injectables should not be administered into the interscapular region.Vaccines (particularly adjuvanted products) should be administered into other subcutaneous (and not intramuscular) sites. The choice of these sites should be based on a balance between the ease of surgical resection of any FISS that might develop and acceptable safety for the vaccinator (i.e. to avoid accidental self\u2010injection during difficult restraint of the animal).Vaccines should be administered into a different site on each occasion. This site should be recorded in the patient's record or on the vaccination card by use of a diagram indicating which products were administered on any one occasion. The sites should be \u2018rotated\u2019 on each occasion. Alternatively, a practice might develop a group policy that all feline vaccinations are administered to a specific site during one calendar year and this site is then rotated during the following year.The VGG encourages all cases of suspected FISS to be notified via the appropriate national reporting route for suspected adverse reactions or to the vaccine manufacturer.\n",

This test has now been validated and applied in a series of published investigations (DiGangi et al.\n2011, Mende et al.\n2014) [EB1]. This test kit may be used for the determination of the presence of protective antibody against FPV as there is excellent correlation between the presence of such antibody and resistance to infection (Lappin et al.\n2002) [EB1]. The FPV test kit is reported to have 89% specificity and 79% sensitivity (Mende et al.\n2014) or 99% specificity and 49% sensitivity (DiGangi et al.\n2011) when compared with a haemagglutination inhibition test. A negative test result indicates that a cat has little or no antibody, and that revaccination is recommended. However, some seronegative cats are in fact immune (false\u2010negative) and their revaccination would be unnecessary.

It should be emphasized that antibody testing for FIV is used to diagnose disease and is of no value in determining immunity to FIV, but as discussed above, where FIV vaccine is used and FIV infection is suspected, diagnosis should be made using a discriminatory serological test or, preferably, a validated PCR test.",

Puppy/kitten programs have traditionally focused on vaccinations, parasite control and neutering. Today, opportunity exists to incorporate behaviour counselling and zoonotic disease management. For the ageing pet, senior care programs are becoming increasingly popular. Nutritional, dental disease and parasite control assessment and counselling should take place on an individualized basis throughout the life of the pet. There is no evidence that older dogs and cats, which have been fully vaccinated as pups or kittens, require a specialized programme of core vaccination (Day 2010, Horzinek 2010, Schultz et al.\n2010). Experimental evidence shows that older dogs and cats have persisting immunological memory to core vaccines, as detected by measurement of serum antibody, and that this may be readily boosted by administration of a single vaccine dose (Day 2010) [EB1]. In adult animals, decisions about revaccination with most core products (CDV, CAV and CPV and FPV) may be made via serological testing. Practitioners who offer this alternative to vaccination report that it is greatly appreciated by owners who may have concerns about vaccination frequency and offering this alternative acts as a \u2018practice builder\u2019. By contrast, aged animals may not be as efficient at mounting primary immune responses to novel antigens that they have not previously encountered (Day 2010) [EB1].
