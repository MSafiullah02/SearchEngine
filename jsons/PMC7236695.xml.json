We contacted one or two lead authors for each tumour type based on engagement in discussion on the forum or prior known expertise, and asked them to form a team of colleagues from different cancer centres to produce guidance. We deliberately were not proscriptive in how the guidance should be written, as we did not want to risk delaying publication. As a result, documents varied in length, style and content. Some groups produced articles formatted for submission to scientific journals, with associated references to clinical trials and other sources of evidence for alternative fractionations. Others produced shorter, pragmatic summaries with advice for clinicians based upon consensus agreement. We expected the guidance to be rapidly reviewed, and asked authors to contact us with any amendments or updates as they came about, to ensure rapid dissemination of the most up-to-date and relevant advice.",

This specialty guide was first published on 16 March 2020, and helped clinicians frame their COVID-19-specific guidance documents by providing clear prioritisation structures for cancer patients. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned COVID-19 rapid guidelines for systemic anti-cancer therapy [7] and radiotherapy [8], which were published on 20 and 28 March 2020, respectively. Prioritisation recommendations within these documents were adapted from NHS England's initial specialty guide and were also referenced within some of the guidance documents. RCR Officers and Fellows contributed to both NICE guidelines and to the NHS-E clinical guide. The NICE radiotherapy guideline included a link to the RCR repository for guidance on modifications to usual care (recommendation 8.8).",

We need to re-appraise our treatments as we learn more about the risks of this novel virus to oncology patients, from studies such as the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project [14]. Data from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, which includes the systemic anti-cancer treatment and radiotherapy datasets, will describe how the delivery of cancer treatment is changing. Individual cancer centres are collecting information on why treatments have changed in response to COVID-19. National research groups and tumour-specific teams are collating this information. For example, CT-Rad are launching \u2018COVID RT\u2019 in collaboration with the RCR, the Society and College of Radiographers and the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine to examine the impact of COVID-19 on radiotherapy [15]. If these data can be linked to meaningful clinical outcomes, we will begin to understand the full impact of COVID-19 on cancer services and patients.",
