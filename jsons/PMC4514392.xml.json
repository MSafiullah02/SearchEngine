As shown in Figure 4, S377-588-Fc at 1 \u03bcg was capable of inducing strong IFN-\u03b3-expressing T cells in both CD4+ (Fig. 4A) and CD8+ (Fig. 4B) populations, while S377-588-Fc at the increased doses (5 or 20 \u03bcg) did not induce higher T cell responses. In addition, S377-588-Fc at 1, 5, or 20 \u03bcg failed to elicit strong IL-2-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. As expected, the adjuvant control group (S377-588-Fc at 0 \u03bcg) induced a background level of specific T cell responses. These results suggest that 1 \u03bcg of S377-588-Fc is sufficient to induce potent IFN-\u03b3-expressing T cell responses in immunized mice.\n\n",

Particularly, this protein at 1 \u03bcg induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against infections of both MERS pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV, similar to those induced at 5 and 20 \u03bcg, respectively, suggesting that 1 \u03bcg of S377-588-Fc formulated with MF59 is sufficient to induce strong neutralizing antibody response capable of protecting mice from MERS-CoV challenge, as that was induced by 10 \u03bcg of S377-588-Fc formulated with MF59 in our previous study.27 Therefore, only about 10% of S377-588-Fc that we tested before is actually needed to achieve the efficacy for prevention of MERS-CoV infection in vaccinated mice, based on the results from the present study.",
