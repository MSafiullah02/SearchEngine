When this complex is activated by ATP, the double\u2010stranded siRNA becomes single stranded, and the complex is now able to bind to complementary mRNA.2 When a complementary mRNA sequence is found, the nuclease activity of the RISC destroys the mRNA.3 In lieu of delivering siRNA into a cell, it is also possible to deliver long double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) or a plasmid or virus that encodes for short hairpin RNA (shRNA). The longer dsRNA or shRNA molecules are cleaved by an enzyme called Dicer into the short siRNA sequences that then act via the RISC complex.4 However, the longer double\u2010stranded RNA molecules can induce a cellular immune response via the interferon system, which is a major obstacle to effectively employing these methods.5\n",

However, many of these results do not necessarily translate to the delivery of siRNA, as DNA and siRNA have very different properties. Where DNA functions in the nucleus, siRNA has activity in the cytoplasm. RNA is more prone to degradation by nucleases than DNA because of the hydroxyl group in its 2\u2019 position. Due to its small size, approximately 20\u201330 nucleotides in length, siRNA is a stiffer molecule than DNA, behaving as a rigid rod. As such, it may not further condense when interacting with cationic agents for delivery, and it has been suggested that the resultant nanoparticles can become too large for endocytosis or provide incomplete encapsulation.12 These differences and their effect on delivery of these molecules have been recently reviewed by Gary, et al.8b\n",

Generally, naked siRNA injected into the body has a very short half life, on the order of minutes, limiting its usefulness.13 However, it has been found that some tissues are able to uptake naked siRNA to a much higher degree than other tissues (for instance the eye, central nervous system, and lung) making localized delivery by direct injection of siRNA to these sites a possibility. One of the largest complications leading to loss of sight is uncontrolled retinal neovascularization in patients that have ischemic retinal disorders.14 Inhibition of VEGF by antibodies has been demonstrated to reduce ocular neovascularization by about 50 %, although further reduction could not be achieved due to difficulties in delivering the antibodies throughout the retinal tissue.14 Thus, other groups have examined the direct delivery to the eye of naked siRNA targeting VEGF to reduce this neovascularization using RNA interference. Ocular neovascularization was decreased by direct injection of naked siRNA against VEGF into the retina of mice.15 Also, the delivery of siRNA targeting VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) resulted in decreased ocular neovascularization with siRNA remaining present in these cells for at least five days.16 There are currently two clinical trials underway exploring the delivery of siRNA against VEGF or VEGFR1 to treat age\u2010related macular degeneration.17\n",

Various chemical modifications of siRNA have been reviewed extensively.26 Frequently, lipophilic moieties such as cholesterol are covalently bound to the siRNA as they have been shown to provide greater in vivo stability by associating with serum proteins in the blood thereby preventing plasma clearance, and also to promote increased cell uptake due to increased cell membrane permeability.27 Localized delivery using chemically modified siRNA has focused on cholesterol\u2010conjugated siRNA. Cholesterol has been conjugated to siRNA complementary to the huntingtin gene, found in patients with Huntington\u2019s disease, and when injected directly into the striatum of mice was found to locally silence gene expression and decrease the pathology of Huntington\u2019s disease in these mice.28 Also, the delivery of cholesterol\u2010conjugated siRNA targeted to herpes viral proteins was able to protect mice from herpes simplex virus 2 when the siRNA was applied directly to the vaginal mucosa.29 Additionally, cholesterol\u2010conjugated siRNA molecules infused directly into the central nervous system in rats were uptaken by oligodendrocytes, a cell type that is difficult to transfect.30 A recent study demonstrated that the modification of siRNA with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and either mannose\u20106\u2010phosphate or galactose efficiently delivered siRNA into hepatocytes in vitro.31 Their previous study demonstrated specific uptake after intravenous injection by hepatocytes in vivo when a similar modification was used for antisense oligonucleotides, and although not demonstrated in this study, it was hypothesized that similar results will be obtained with this modified siRNA.",

A major disadvantage of using these techniques for local delivery is that they can be rapidly dispersed from the delivery site due to their small size. Therefore, the challenge of getting a sufficient amount of siRNA to the desired location during a desired period of time still remains. There is a paucity of work examining the use of macroscopic biomaterial scaffolds for the local delivery of siRNA. Biomaterial scaffolds are frequently used in tissue engineering to encourage cell migration and proliferation within the material, which is placed at a tissue defect site. It is often possible to incorporate bioactive factors into these scaffolds to encourage the tissue regeneration process, as these factors can be released from the scaffold over time to incorporated cells and the surrounding host cells. Although traditionally these bioactive factors have been growth factors or DNA to upregulate the expression of growth or transcription factors, it may be beneficial to use siRNA to aid in the tissue regeneration process, perhaps by inhibiting the production of molecules that hinder the healing process or by influencing cell behaviors such as proliferation or differentiation. The use of RNA interference for regenerative medicine applications has been reviewed by Yao, et al.53 The release of siRNA incorporated into a biomaterial scaffold could be mediated by diffusion through the biopolymer pores, the degradation of the polymer, or through ionic or affinity interactions with the scaffold. The released siRNA would then act locally, and the scaffold itself could aid in tissue regeneration by providing a conductive or inductive environment for cellular growth within the defect.54 Work in our laboratory was the first to demonstrate the potential of such a system.55 Ionically crosslinked alginate, photocrosslinked alginate, and collagen hydrogels were shown to provide varying siRNA release profiles, and in all cases the siRNA released was bioactive and able to silence protein expression in cells both surrounding the scaffolds and incorporated within the scaffolds (schematic shown in Figure 3). The use of collagen scaffolds to deliver siRNA\u2010dendrimer nanoparticles has also recently been demonstrated, although it was found that approximately 60 % of the siRNA was released in the first two days with little subsequent release.56 However, the nanoparticles delivered from these scaffolds were shown to reduce protein expression for up to seven days when cells were cultured directly on the scaffolds. Singh, et al. incorporated DNA, siRNA, and chemokines into PLGA microparticles, which were then incorporated into hydrogels made either of dextran vinyl sulfone and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or PEG alone.57 The chemokines were released from the hydrogels to promote the migration of antigen\u2010presenting cells into the hydrogels, and these cells were then able to uptake the siRNA and DNA released from the PLGA microparticles. Further developing these biomaterial scaffold systems and others that incorporate siRNA offers exciting possibilities for the sustained and targeted delivery of siRNA to a specific site in vivo.",

However, there are significant challenges that need to be overcome before this technology can be used in the clinical setting. In particular, for applications that will benefit from the local delivery of the siRNA, it will be important to develop systems that are capable of providing bioactive siRNA to a specific site rather than systemically. As highlighted in this article, many groups have examined the local delivery of siRNA using various delivery modalities (Table 1). In certain tissues, it has been demonstrated that a simple injection of naked siRNA will silence gene expression specifically in that tissue. However, this technique for local delivery is unfortunately limited to only a few tissue types including the eye, central nervous system, and lung. To achieve local gene silencing in other tissues, a variety of approaches have been pursued to help stabilize the siRNA and to encourage cellular uptake by administration to the site of interest; they include chemical modification of the siRNA or complexation within liposomes or polymers to form nanoparticles. Overall, the field of siRNA delivery has been very focused on the use of nanoparticles. While these may promote the stability and uptake of the siRNA, they do not necessarily provide localization as they may be readily carried away from the site of interest. Only recently has the use of macroscopic biomaterial scaffolds for siRNA delivery been examined and reported. There is still significant work to be done in this area to optimize the delivery systems and ensure longer\u2010term release of bioactive siRNA at the site of interest.
