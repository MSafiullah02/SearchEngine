However, they have overlooked the fact that these civil servants experience severe physical and psychological damage because of their excessive compassion in servicing people. The most severe instance occurred in May 2016, when Dr. Ya-Cheng Chian, who worked in an animal shelter in Taiwan, died from suicide using the drugs that served to euthanize animals because of the psychological stress induced by the job requirement (BBC 2017).",

            "text": "Studies on public administration have mostly focused on helping public servants complete their tasks efficiently and building anticorruption systems. They have neglected the helpless individuals experiencing compassion fatigue because of how dedicated they are to their jobs in massive organizations. This situation may be caused by a certain factor. As Waldo (1980) questioned, \u201cWhy would an instrument designed to be impersonal and calculating be expected to be effective in delivering sympathy or compassion?\u201d Fortunately, studies on psychological counseling have focused on the psychological symptoms from overworking due to high levels of compassion. These symptoms include the feelings of helplessness, anxiety, fear, guilt, anger, numbness, and disengagement. Moreover, the professional term \u201ccompassion fatigue\u201d was introduced (Figley and Roop 2006), and effective collective and individual adaptation strategies have been proposed in the psychology field to combat compassion fatigue. Research has suggested that if managers collectively can reduce employees\u2019 work burden (Keidel 2002; Yoder 2010) and increase organizational (McArthur et al. 2017: 9) and social support (Dickinson et al. 2010: 153), employees\u2019 psychological health and organizational behavior can remain unaffected by compassion fatigue. Individually, if employees can strengthen their own psychological health (Lally 2005), increase their compassion satisfaction (Figley and Roop 2006), and apply mindfulness (Josefsson et al. 2011) and emotional separation (Corcoran 1983), they can alleviate psychological health deterioration and reduce negative organizational behavior.",

These have essentially been considered strategies for alleviating negative effects (deteriorating psychological health and organizational behavior). However, we proposed that the effects of mindfulness and emotional separation can vastly differ in administrative organizations. When administrative ethics is applied against the emotional separation strategy, emotional separation becomes highly similar to the \u201cmoral disengagement\u201d worried about in administrative ethics. Empirical research has verified that moral disengagement can undermine the personal mental health of civil servants and cause negative organizational behavior. The two mental strategies of mindfulness and moral disengagement appear to have different internal logics; however, studies have not examined and compared these psychological strategies.",

People experiencing it tend to feel physical discomfort upon repeatedly, involuntarily remembering major traumatic events even though they try to avoid remembering them (Figley and Roop 2006; Figley 2002a). This causes severe physical problems, including anxiety and depression (Cocker and Joss 2016). Moreover, as a form of damage to the willingness to work, compassion fatigue causes care providers to dissociate with their own emotions to protect themselves. Consequently, care providers become indifferent and disengaged from compassion and tolerance to patients\u2019 pain (Figley 2002a; Figley 2002b), and they become less willing to work.",

For example, individuals who adopt mindfulness tend to be older (Mahlo and Windsor 2020) and needs to be exposed to specific organizational conditions, such as high leadership, relative priority, strong networks and effective communications, formally appointed implementation leaders, and knowledge and beliefs about intervention and execution (Hudson et al. 2020); they are also influenced by social cognition (Beattie et al. 2020). By comparison, as for whether an individual adopts moral disengagement as a strategy, personality (e.g., extraversion) was noted to be influential (Mazzone and Camodeca 2019) in addition to the threat of job insecurity (Probst et al. 2020) and social worldview -- such as social cynicism or fate control (Alexandra 2019).

As mentioned, these predictors could be factors from the individual, organizational, or social dimensions. Mindfulness had strong positive effects, and moral disengagement had strong negative effects. Therefore, if employees are led to adopt mindfulness rather than moral disengagement, their psychological health and organizational behavior can be improved. However, studies have mainly regarded mindfulness and disengagement as predicted variables and have attempted to understand the effects generated by these them. Future research can benefit from comprehensively and systematically focusing on compassion fatigue from concerned parties\u2019 perspectives and identifying factors influencing civil servants\u2019 adoption of mindfulness (or moral disengagement) strategies. This can enable the practical industry to guide civil servants to generate mindfulness and avoid moral disengagement (Table 5).",
