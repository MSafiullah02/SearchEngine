Histopathological evidence demonstrating pathology consistent with the enteropathogen isolated is desirable to establish a causal association and requests for postmortem samples from outbreaks were included in the instructions sent to practitioners. However, the number of postmortem samples collected was very small, possibly because of the extra time required to perform the procedures, the cost and time involved in revisiting a property to necropsy calves that died subsequent to the initial visit, the lack of suitable samples and the reluctance of farm managers to euthanase sick calves.

Dairy beef operations grow and finish dairy/dairy-cross steers and heifers for the domestic and export beef market. The dairy beef property is very different from a dairy farm, with calves coming from multiple sources, thus providing opportunities for a diversity of pathogens to be introduced. This situation was reflected by the significantly greater proportion of dairy beef samples from which multiple pathogens were isolated. The logistic regression performed to investigate the pathogen profile of dairy and dairy beef operations was limited to the age group that accounted for nearly 90% of the dairy beef sample submissions (i.e. 5-14 days), because the data for the other age groups was sparse and unbalanced. It would have been ideal to have more animals in the different age groups so that age and system could be evaluated in the same model. The age distribution of calves in dairy beef operations is inherently slightly different to dairy operations because of the restrictions in Australia on the transport of calves aged less than 4 days.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are a number of reasons for the increased probability of identifying rotavirus or Salmonella in dairy beef samples. Dairy bull calves are an unwanted byproduct of current dairy production systems, so are less likely to receive colostrum and thus passive transfer of immunity than the heifer calves that are retained as herd replacements. Co-mingling of dairy beef calves during farm collection and transport also provides more opportunity for mixed pathogen exposure and stress may contribute to immunosuppression. Although rotavirus and Salmonella are prevalent on a significant number of farms, there are likely to be strain variations between farms. Thus, antibodies derived from maternal colostrum may only be specific for strains on a particular property. In order to maximise the number of animals that pass through dairy beef enterprises, there is a need for all available housing to be maximally stocked, which can lead to failure of appropriate disinfection between the removal of older calves and the introduction of young ones, resulting in enteric pathogens being passed between different groups of calves.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The results of this study provide valuable insight into the pathogens associated with outbreaks of diarrhoea in dairy calves across Australia. The prevalence of enteropathogens was comparable to or higher than the prevalence reported overseas. Rotavirus and C. parvum were the most prevalent enteropathogens identified in calves aged less than 6 weeks. Salmonella spp. and rotavirus were more likely to be isolated from diarrhoeic calves from dairy beef rather than dairy operations. Disease prevention and management is important from a calf and public health perspective, because of the zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium and Salmonella spp. Robert was a country boy (Crookwell, NSW), an excellent student and led a very full and productive life as a devoted family man, successful scientist and university teacher.

His undergraduate lecture courses were meticulously prepared and presented, with high scores in student assessments.
