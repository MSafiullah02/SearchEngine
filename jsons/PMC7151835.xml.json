In the absence of antifungal prophylaxis, candidiasis and aspergillosis typically occur in the first month after transplantation.

However, in the era of routine use of antiviral prophylaxis (typically given for 3 to 6 months after transplant), most CMV disease now occurs later, after antiviral prophylaxis has been discontinued (\u201clate-onset\u201d CMV disease). Pneumocystis pneumonia and, to a large extent, toxoplasmosis are seen infrequently today because of the effectiveness of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis. Invasive aspergillosis has long been regarded as an early-occurring infection. However, most cases now occur between 1 and 6 months after transplant. Notably, in lung transplant recipients Aspergillus infections now occur after 12 months; the median time to onset after transplant was 357 days in one report4 and 33 \u00b1 19.6 months in another.5 Widespread use of mold-active antifungal prophylaxis and chronic rejection or its treatment, or both, likely account for these trends.",

A small number (4% to 7%) of HCV-infected transplant recipients (of all organ types) develop progressive fatal cholestatic liver disease during the first year after transplantation. These cases are marked by a high viral load, and liver biopsies show severe hepatocyte dropout with minimal parenchymal inflammation. The long-term outcome of other HCV-infected patients depends to some extent on the organ transplanted. Liver transplant candidates who have HCV viremia before transplantation almost always reinfect their liver grafts after transplantation, and 46% to 97% develop hepatitis during the first 2 to 3 years after transplantation. Ongoing HCV infection leads to graft cirrhosis in up to 30% of patients by 5 years after transplantation. Findings from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) liver transplantation database have shown that long-term outcomes (>5 years) after liver transplantation for HCV are similar to those after liver transplantation for other indications.23 However, a retrospective analysis of more than 10,000 liver recipients in the UNOS database showed that medium-term survival of HCV-infected patients was inferior to that of uninfected patients. Longitudinal studies in kidney transplant populations have also shown that chronic HCV infection has an adverse impact on survival, but this effect is not clearly discernible until the second decade after transplantation. Excess deaths are due to not only the direct effects of liver disease but also a higher rate of sepsis.",

Interferon monotherapy produces end-of-treatment responses in only 12% to 36% of liver recipients with HCV infection, but very few patients have sustained responses 6 months later.24 The use of combination therapy with long-acting pegylated interferons and ribavirin has led to sustained virologic response rates of 26% to 50%.24 Based on these data, pegylated interferon with or without ribavirin has been the treatment of choice for histopathologically documented hepatitis C recurrence, but there are differences of opinion on optimal timing and selection of patients for treatment. In actual practice, interferon and ribavirin have side effects that make them difficult to administer to liver transplant recipients, so only a small proportion of the patients are actually able to benefit from their use. Currently, treatment is generally used only in patients with histologically significant disease (grade 3 or 4 inflammation, grade 2 to 4 fibrosis) rather than preemptively in all infected patients. With the development of several new classes of both direct-acting antivirals (protease inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors) and host-targeted agents (cyclophilin inhibitors) that inhibit HCV replication, the indications for initiating therapy are likely to broaden and the efficacy of newer regimens is anticipated to be substantially improved compared with current pegylated interferon/ribavirin regimens. However, important drug interactions with current immunosuppressants will be a major challenge with the use of these agents in transplant patients. Early promising results of newer antiviral therapies will likely revolutionize or substantially alter the treatment of HCV infection in both orthotopic liver transplant candidates and recipients.",

Although infrequent, DDIs are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality; deaths occurred in 40% of the recipients with documented transmissions.41 Viral infections account for nearly one third of all confirmed DDIs. Transmission of certain viruses (e.g., CMV, EBV, HCV, and HBV) is expected to occur predictably. However, the risk can be mitigated by use of appropriate prophylactic measures in the recipient with minimal impact on post-transplant outcomes. Unexpected DDIs (e.g., lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, rabies, WNV, HIV) have been documented with devastating sequelae. These infections have occurred when the disease was not suspected or recognized in the donor at the time of death.",

Donors with cryptococcosis, including those with unrecognized cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, may transmit this yeast with the allograft. Active histoplasmosis or undiagnosed and presumably asymptomatic infection in the donor that had not resolved by the time of death can result in donor-derived histoplasmosis. Potential donors from an endemic area with either active or occult infection can also transmit coccidioidomycosis. In general, donors with undiagnosed meningoencephalitis are not suitable for donation because transmission of not only fungal pathogens but other diseases, including prion infections and Balamuthia, may occur (Table 313-7\n). Rare instances of aspergillosis and other filamentous fungi, including agents of mucormycosis, have also been transmitted from infected donors. More recently, these fungi have emerged as a serious complication of transplant tourism (the practice of traveling abroad to commercially acquire an organ) and have been associated with graft loss or death in 76% of the cases.43\n",
