It is generally accepted that approximately 75% of emerging infectious diseases for humans are zoonoses [1,3,4]. The rate of emergence of novel viruses appears to be increasing as a result of both increased spillover from their natural reservoirs and our improved ability in detection [3].",

The SARS outbreak in 2002\u20132003 remains as one the most impactful pandemic outbreaks of the 21st century mainly due to the fact that the aetiology was totally unknown during the outbreak, which made accurate diagnosis and effective control impossible [13,14]. The outbreak lasted more than six months with rapid spread of the virus from southern China to more than 30 countries on all major continents, and resulted in more than 8000 human infections and 774 deaths [14]. Multiple international teams spent the next decade hunting for the origin of SARS-CoV and serendipitously found many SARS-CoV related viruses in bats, most abundantly from the genus Rhinolophus (horseshoe bats) [15, 16, 17]. The most conclusive evidence came from the isolation of a CoV from bats in China which was more than 98% identical in genome sequence to SARS-CoV and capable of using the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, on human cells [18\u2022]. While it is not easy to assess the spillover potential of many SARS-CoV related bat CoVs due to unsuccessful attempts to isolate the viruses, it should be noted that a \u2018consensus\u2019 virus constructed via reverse genetics pointed to a high probability of human infection [19].",

As of October 1, 2018, MERS-CoV has infected 2249 people in 27 countries with 35% case fatality [21]. Camels have been identified as important reservoir hosts for MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV related viruses [22,23,24\u2022,25,26,27\u2022], but there is strong evidence that the evolutionary ancestors of these viruses are bats [28,29,30\u2022].

In 2016\u20132017, there was a major outbreak of swine acute diarrhoea syndrome (SADS) in piglets in multiple southern China farms in a region geographically close to where the SARS outbreak began in 2002 [32\u2022\u2022]. The origin of the causative agent, SADS-CoV, was quickly traced back to a bat colony in the vicinity of the pig farms where bat CoV with more than 98% genome sequence identity was detected in Rhinolophus spp. bats. SADS-CoV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus and is genetically most closely related to HKU2, a previously reported bat CoV [32\u2022\u2022]. Human coronavirus 229E is in the same genus, but is only distantly related to those bat CoVs. Examination of pig farmers with close contact with sick and dying piglets did not yield evidence of human infection, hence humans may not be susceptible to SADS-CoV. Further study is required to determine the true zoonotic potential of SADS-CoV and closely related bat CoVs.",

            "text": "One of the first bat-borne BSL4 agents identified was Hendra virus (HeV) in Australia in 1994 [33\u2022], an emerging pathogen that caused the deaths of 7 people. Additionally, 103 equine and 2 canine cases have been reported [34,35]. In humans the case fatality rate from HeV infection is 57%. All four species of flying fox in Australia (Pteropus poliocephalus, P. alecto, P. scapulatus and P. conspicillatus) have been found to be seropositive for HeV antibodies and all have detectable virus in their urine with black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) being the major reservoir host [36]. A closely related virus, Nipah virus (NiV) emerged in 1998 in Malaysia, which transmitted from bats to humans via pigs as an intermediate and amplifying host [37]. In total, that outbreak resulted in 283 human cases and 109 deaths (39% case fatality) in Malaysia as well as 11 cases and one death in Singaporean abattoir workers [38]. A related, but not identical virus, was responsible for multiple NiV outbreaks in Bangladesh/India [39,40], with the latest outbreak that occurred in 2018 in Kerala and resulted in 19 human infections and 17 deaths [41]. The reservoir hosts of NiV have been identified as the large flying fox (P. vampyrus) and small flying fox (P. hypomenalus) in Malaysia [42,43] and the Indian flying fox (P. giganteus) in Bangladesh and India [44,45]. After many years of unsuccessful attempts, NiV was isolated from the Indian flying fox in Bangladesh [46]. The current status of henipavirus transmission during outbreaks is summarised in Figure 2\n. Apart from HeV and NiV, Cedar virus (CedPV) remains the only other isolated henipavirus species and experimental evidence from animal trials suggests that CedPV is non-pathogenic for humans [47]. Serological evidence of henipavirus infection has been detected in Lyle\u2019s flying fox (Pteropus lylei) populations in Southeast Asia [48], large flying fox in Indonesia [49] and may be endemic among bat populations on the African continent [50, 51, 52, 53]. Additionally, a Ghanaian bat henipavirus, Kumasi Virus (KumPV), genome has been sequenced [54\u2022\u2022]. Cumulatively, these studies indicate a wide global distribution of henipaviruses.",

The virus was also shown to be zoonotic, with 2 piggery workers with high-level exposure developing a serious influenza-like illness and rash during the outbreak. These individuals also developed neutralizing antibodies to MenPV [55]. Bats were hypothesized to be the source of the outbreak and MenPV-neutralizing antibodies were detected in grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus), black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) and spectacled flying foxes (Pteropus conspicillatus) [56]. In 2009, MenPV was isolated from a bat roost at Cedar Grove, Australia, where black flying foxes were the predominant species in this colony at the time of sampling [57]. Tioman virus (TioPV) was isolated from urine of the small flying fox (Pteropus hypomelanus) collected from Tioman Island, Malaysia [58]. Due the close relationship of TioPV with the zoonotic MenPV, an experimental challenge of pigs was performed [59] and the trial suggested that pigs could act as an intermediate or amplifying host for TioPV and that oral secretion is a possible means of viral transmission.",

In 2012, metagenomic analysis from RNA extracted from blood and serum samples of a patient with severe acute febrile illness revealed a novel paramyxovirus [69\u2022] most closely related to ThkPV-3. The novel paramyxovirus was provisionally named Sosuga virus (SosPV) in recognition of its probable geographic origin (South Sudan, Uganda). The patient, a wildlife biologist, developed a severe illness after spending six weeks sampling bats and rodents. Symptoms included fever, malaise, headache, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, neck stiffness, a metallic taste, sore throat and a maculopapular rash that was present later in the infection. The biologist was discharged after two weeks of hospitalization, but considerable sequelae (myalgia, arthralgia, headache, malaise, and fatigue) persisted for several months [69\u2022]. Bat tissues collected during the period just before the onset of symptoms were tested for SosPV, and several Egyptian rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) were found to be positive. Four additional SosPV-positive samples were found in archived tissues from Egyptian rousette bats collected at other locations in Uganda, suggesting this species could be a potential natural reservoir for this paramyxovirus [70].",

Both members of the genus Marburgvirus, Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV), have been shown to cause fatal diseases in humans [74,75]. The third genus, Cuevavirus, contains only one species, Lloviu virus (LLOV), whose disease-causing potential in humans is unknown [76,77]. Our group has recently characterized complete coding genome of a new filovirus named Mengla virus (MLAV) from Rousettus bats in China, which is genetically distinctive from all known filoviruses and most likely represents the prototype of a new filovirus genus (Figure 3\n), putatively named Dianlovirus [78\u2022].",

In 2012, a new influenza virus genomic sequence was identified in frugivorous yellow-shouldered bats (Sturnira lilium) in Guatemala and was designated H17N10 [110]. The following year, a distinct influenza genome, classified as H18N11, was characterized from the flat-faced fruit bat (Artibeus planirostris) in Peru [111]. Although virus isolation was not successful, reverse genetics was used to synthetically generate these viruses [112] and subsequent research highlighted the differences between these viruses and conventional influenza viruses. Identification of these viruses in bats not only expanded the host reservoir of influenza and the genetic diversity of the viruses, but immediately raised the question about zoonotic potential. Studies using synthetic viruses have allowed the identification and characterization of cellular receptors mediating virus attachment and entry, factors important for understanding the tissue tropism and possible zoonotic transmission [112, 113, 114].",

Evidence of a lethal genotype of Andes orthohantavirus (ANDV), Araraquara orthohantavirus (ARQV), has been documented among several Neotropical bats in Brazil [118,120]. ARQV is one of the most virulent and lethal among all hantaviruses in humans and viral RNA closely related to ARQV was detected in urine of the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) [119].

However, to date we have only experienced severe, but not lethal, infections in humans. On the other hand, filoviruses and henipaviruses are far the more deadly but the frequency of spillover is relatively low [7,12]. Rabies virus is highly lethal and responsible for a large number of human deaths. But the direct spillover from bats to humans is limited. In contrast, the known genetic diversity of CoVs in bats is much greater than any of the other bat zoonotic viruses. CoVs contain the largest genomes of all known RNA viruses, and hence are naturally exposed to a higher chance of genetic mutation per genome. To prevent frequent \u2018lethal mutations\u2019, CoVs have evolved to contain an exoribonuclease which increases the fidelity of RNA genome replication [127,128]. However, the large positive RNA genomes of CoVs are highly prone to gross genetic changes via recombination, which is elegantly illustrated by two recent studies, one on SARS-like viruses [129\u2022] and another on the discovery of a recombinant CoV containing a reovirus P10 gene sequence [130\u2022,131]. The true rate of CoV spillover into humans and livestock animals may be greatly underestimated as these occurrences do not always cause severe or lethal disease, demonstrated by serological surveillance. Spillover and zoonotic transmission of CoVs is not limited to bat CoVs, rather increasing evidence suggests the emergence of new CoV strains and the mutation of existing strains resulting in new disease syndromes in both animals and humans [132,133].",

            "text": "One of the challenging scientific questions is why many of the bat-borne zoonotic viruses are so lethal when they spill over into human and/or livestock animal populations. Up until now, our knowledge was very limited in addressing this question due to lack of research tools to conduct comparative immunology and pathogenesis studies in bats. Several recent studies, however, start to reveal that bats may have evolved a more balanced innate defence system. On one hand, bats have elevated level of certain defence genes or pathways from type I interferon [134] to apoptosis [135], at the same time bats exhibit more immune tolerance in different pathways, from inflammation [136], STING signalling [137] to NK cell activation [138]. However, it should be cautioned that these are very early and preliminary studies, many of them based on genomics and bioinformatics analysis only, more in-depth functional studies are required to get a better understanding of the asymptomatic infection of bats by viruses highly lethal in other mammals.",

While most of the investigation is triggered by zoonotic spillover of bat viruses, the impact of spillover into livestock animals should not be underestimated as shown by the SADS-CoV outbreak. From the great genetic diversity and wide geographical locations of the various bat viruses detected so far, it is almost certain that we will see more and more disease outbreaks caused by bat viruses. Among the \u2018known unknowns\u2019, bat coronaviruses may be a more likely cause of future spillover into both human and livestock populations due to their greater genetic diversity already known in bats around the world, their large positive strand RNA genome size with a high rate of recombination, and proven spillover events in both human and animals. We are still at an infancy stage in terms of understanding bat biology in the context of how some of the most lethal viruses can peacefully co-exist with bats, but most recent research findings suggest the key but not in other mammals.",
