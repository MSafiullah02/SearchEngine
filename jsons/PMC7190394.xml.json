This is concerning because Wuhan Mental Health Center, the largest psychiatric hospital in Hubei province, reports that more than 80 staff and patients have been infected with COVID-19.3",

If antiviral drugs are used without supplemental medication, patients with psychiatric disorders can experience relapses in their mental illness. Importantly, patients may present with impulsivity, running or other abnormal behaviours that are not conducive to the control of COVID-19. Psychotropic medications are thus necessary to avoid these and other behavioural problems. The most pressing question for doctors on the front line is how to choose the appropriate psychotropic drug in combination with the antivirals recommended by the NHCC.",

Because sedative and hypnotic drugs such as oxazepam and lorazepam are not metabolised by the CYP system, these are quite safe when used in combination with the recommended antiviral drugs.",
