Moreover, this system promotes atherogenic processes by increasing oxidative stress, stimulating vascular muscle and monocyte proliferation. Based on their biological target, drugs inhibiting the RAAS may be distinguished as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs). ACEIs enact their blood pressure-lowering effects by blocking the peptidyl-dipeptidase that hydrolyzes angiotensin I (A-I) to angiotensin II (A-II). In addition, it inactivates bradykinin, a vasodilating peptide promoting the release of nitrogen monoxide and prostacyclin. ARBs have no effect on bradykinin metabolism and block the effects of A-II more selectively than ACEIs. In detail, ARBs determine their antihypertensive effect by preventing the binding of A-II to the A-II receptor type 1 (AT1). Finally, DRIs exert blood pressure-lowering effects by decreasing plasma renin activity and inhibiting the conversion of angiotensinogen to A-I [5].",

[4] recently hypothesized in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus treated with ACE2-increasing drugs might be at higher risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, the authors suggested that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) may be a more suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment than ARBs/ACEIs because of their lack of increased ACE2 expression or activity.",

The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with ACE2, its cellular-binding site, leads to ACE2 downregulation. In turn, this results in excessive production of angiotensin by ACE, whereas less ACE2 is capable of converting it to angiotensin (1-7), an heptapeptide with vasodilator activity [1, 10]. It has been suggested that exaggerated stimulation of AT1 by A-II determines increased pulmonary vascular permeability, thereby mediating increased lung pathology when the expression of ACE2 is decreased [11, 12]. Thus, higher ACE2 expression following chronic treatment with ARBs may protect patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 against acute lung injury rather than increasing the risk of developing COVID-19.",

Instead, on 17 March 2020, the Italian Drug Agency issued a warning against any change of antihypertensive therapies in patients with well-controlled hypertension, irrespective of the agents being used, because of the lack of clinical data [14]. Ten days later, the European Medicines Agency advised that, since there is no clinical evidence that these drugs can worsen SARS-CoV-2 infections, it is important that patients do not discontinue their treatment with ACEIs or ARBs and there is no need to switch to other medicines [15]. These recommendations are in line with the position statements of national/international scientific societies (e.g., European Society of Cardiology [16], Italian Society of Pharmacology [17], Heart Failure Society of America, American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association [18], International Society of Hypertension [19], European Society of Hypertension [20]) that recommend continuing RAAS inhibitor therapy for patients who are currently prescribed such agents for indications for which it is known that these agents are safe and effective, such as acute and chronic heart failure [21], acute myocardial infarction [22] and hypertension [23].",
