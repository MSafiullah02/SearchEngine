We can make at-risk patients we triage, and patients who access our practice websites, aware of the Mouth Cancer Foundation symptom checker (www.mouthcancerfoundation. org). 4 Video consultation also offers a solution and practice websites and social media threads can include oral health advice. National Smile Month started on 18 May offering digital engagement (www. nationalsmilemonth.org/). Mouth Cancer Action Month is in November; the infamous #BlueLipSelfie might help raise awareness (www.bluelipselfie.co.uk/). We can continue to signpost smoking cessation advice online too -perhaps this new remote practice offers an opportunity to support patients who are interested in quitting smoking and the Smokefree service allows patient to access advice and support from experts: quitnow. smokefree.nhs.uk/. We need to remember those patients who have previously received a cancer diagnosis who would usually be accessing our care to receive support and preventive dental care. Many charities such as The Throat Cancer Foundation and The Mouth Cancer Foundation are continuing to provide support to affected patients (www.throatcancerfoundation.org, mouthcancerfoundation.org/).",

Furthermore, many patients who undergo resection of oral cancer require post-operative intensive treatment unit (ITU) beds. 2 With approximately 8,000 more hospital deaths to date in 2020 than is routine, elective surgery poses stress on a healthcare system already experiencing unprecedented pressures in ITU, and perhaps, a redeployed staff. 3",
