The polypropylene punched felt was finished with the finishing agent of microcapsule, nano ZnO and TiO 2 and polymer adhesive, and the composite air filter with anti-virus and anti-bacteria properties were formed, staphylococcus aureus, colibacillus and candida albicans were applied to antibacterial experiments. The results indicate that the anti-bacteria rate are all 100%, and the virus inactivation rate also reaches 100% to pandemic influenza A virus.",

The main factors influencing indoor air quality is the respirable particulates (such as dust, smoke) and Living Creature Gas Gum (for example, germ, virus, mold, original living creature). The particle diameter less than 10 ms in the respirable particulates will result in respiratory disease, skin infectious disease. An enormous allergy source is composed of dust, germ, hair and scurf, wall louse, smoke and the harmful material in the air. According to statistics, there might be more than 350 kinds of volatility organic compounds (VOC) in the office, some VOCs are thought to be carcinogens or the trigger factor of asthma [2, 3] . For a conservative estimate, the premature death people are up to more than 110000 due to the indoor pollution annually [4] .",
