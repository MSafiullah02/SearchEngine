High-sensitive CRP and nNO reflected responses best (52% had increased CRP levels at 2-3 days; 66% had decreased nNO levels). White blood cell and procalcitonin counts rarely exceeded the reference range. Increased local and systemic inflammatory response were linked to multiple, adenoviral, or influenza A viral etiology or the detection of bacterial ARS. Local response correlated with imaging findings of wide paranasal sinus involvement and ostiomeatal complex occlusion. At 9 to 10 days, elevated ( 11 mg/L) and moderately elevated ( 49 mg/L) hs-CRP predicted bacterial ARS well (likelihood ratio [LR]1 3.3 and LR1 15.8, respectively), but the sensitivity for both findings remained low.",

A paranasal cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was taken at enrollment and at the follow-up visit. Coronal, axial, and sagittal slices of the maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses and the ostiomeatal complex (OMC) were visualized. Both sides of the paranasal sinuses were graded separately as follows 22 : grade 0 (normal), 3 mm mucosal thickening; grade 1 (minor abnormality), 4 mm mucosal thickening at any point in the sinus 23 ; and grade 2 (major abnormality), air-fluid level, gas bubbles, or total opacification. The ostiomeatal complex (OMC) was graded as 0 (open) or 2 (occluded). We determined the total CBCT score (0-16) by summing up the grades of each sinus and the OMC on both sides.",

            "text": "The facts that the local and systemic inflammatory responses were stronger in bacterial ARS than in nonbacterial ARS, and that these reactions were strongest at the beginning of respiratory symptoms, indicates that bacterial ARS starts to develop during an early phase of symptoms. This is in agreement with our earlier finding that there is a gradually increasing discrepancy in CBCT and symptom scores between bacterial and nonbacterial ARS that begins at the start of the symptoms. 21 Furthermore, we have shown earlier that the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the nasal middle meatus (coinfection) at the beginning of viral ARS modifies the symptoms and is one factor that may lead to the finding of the same bacteria in the maxillary sinus. 9 However, here the middle meatal NTHi was not associated with raised CRP or decreased nNO. This raises the question of whether the pathogenic bacteria were already present in the maxillary sinus at the beginning of symptoms. We do not know this because we performed the maxillary sinus aspirations and bacterial cultures at the follow-up visit. This would also argue against the generally presented hypothesis that bacterial ARS follows an antecedent viral ARS. 11 At 9 to 10 days, elevated hs-CRP ( 11 mg/L) predicted bacterial ARS relatively well (LR1 3.3) and predicted moderately elevated hs-CRP ( 49 mg/L) very well (LR1 15.8), but the sensitivity figures for these findings were low. We have earlier examined the respective figures for various symptoms and clinical findings in this same material. 20 Compared to these diagnostic measures, the finding of elevated CRP ( 11 mg/L) proved to be better at predicting bacterial ARS than symptoms; it paralleled the findings of moderate or profuse amount of nasal secretion and cervical adenopathy but was poorer than the finding of nasal secretion in the posterior pharynx (supplementary material). Moderately elevated CRP ( 49 mg/L) accurately predicted bacterial ARS but only was present in four patients. Because of the relatively high negative likelihood ratios, the absence of elevated CRP could not be used to rule out bacterial ARS. Thus, CRP cannot be recommended for routine screening of bacterial ARS. Because the WBC and PCT counts rarely exceeded the reference values, their diagnostic value was low.",

We were not able to verify viral etiology in all the subjects, similar to prior research on natural colds. 30 We did not perform maxillary sinus aspiration to every patient, but only to those with CBCT findings that supported bacterial ARS. This might have caused information bias. However, CT is considered to be the best imaging modality for evaluating paranasal sinus disease. 10 We defined bacterial ARS to include only the maxillary sinuses for which sinus aspirate is possible. Due to available resources, the study group was relatively small. Despite this, we found significant associations between hs-CRP and nNO levels and various clinical parameters. We wanted to increase the possibility of encountering frequent bacterial ARS; therefore, conscripts were recruited. The amount of patients who get bacterial sinusitis during ARS in primary care usually is estimated to be 2% 10, 11 We would have needed 400 such patients to get the eight cases of bacterial ARS that we had in this study.",
