            "text": "The majority of head and neck infections are odontogenic [17]. Odontogenic infections can spread and cause severe complications, e.g. compromised airways, sepsis, tissue necrosis, endocarditis, mediastinitis and deep neck infections [3]. These severe odontogenic infections can be potentially life-threatening [14, 17]. There are several predisposing factors which may exacerbate odontogenic infections, such as immunodeficiency (human immunodeficiency virus HIV), long-term diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic alcohol abuse, hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, immunosuppression after organ transplantation, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and systemic lupus erythematosus [4, 9, 11, 12, 16]. Usually odontogenic infections respond well to a combination of surgical sanitation, incision, drainage and antibiotic therapy [5, 14]. Odontogenic infections exhibit a variety of different pathogens: Streptococci, especially Streptococcus viridans, a representative of gram-positive aerobic bacteria and Prevotella species, a gram-negative anaerobic bacteria are common pathogens in odontogenic infections [1, 8, 15]. The purpose of this study was to analyse etiology and sequence of especially severe manifestations of odontogenic abscesses.",

This time period was chosen because we found an increase of septic occurrences of odontogenic infections between these dates. The treatment for all patients included incision, drainage and surgical sanitation of the odontogenic focus plus antibiotic treatment. Intraoperative swabs were taken to adjust antibiotic treatment following performance of an antibiogram and a resistogram. Within this population, 16 patients (13 male, three female) with an average age of 52.75 (SD 9.5) exhibited critical courses and required postoperative intensive medical care. Nine patients underwent preoperative computed tomography (CT) to obtain an exact overview of the extent of infection. We confirm that we have read the Helsinki Declaration and have followed the guidelines in this investigation. This study has been approved by the local ethical committee.",

A decayed mandibular molar or premolar was the infectious focus in all 16 patients (Table 1). All patients showed swelling of affected areas, trismus, dysphagia, dyspnea, involvement of several fascial spaces, phlegmonous spread, laboratory parameters of septicemia and a C-reactive protein (CRP) above 200 mg/l with white blood cell counts greater than 19*1000/ \u03bcl at admittance. Preoperatively white blood cell count averaged 22.0 \u00b1 10.6*1000 cells/\u03bcl and CRP 251 \u00b1 1.0 mg/ml. The preoperative CT scan of the head and neck region in nine patients provided an exact overview of the extent of infection and the affected fascial spaces. An antibiotic therapy with Clindamycin 600 mg 1\u20130-1 had been administered to three patients before hospital admission and surgical sanitation of the odontogenous focus had been performed. All Patients underwent extraoral incision, drainage of affected areas and elimination of odontogenic foci under general anaesthesia. On average, the maximum number of drainage tubes inserted was 9.1 \u00b1 standard deviation. A second look surgery was required in four patients. Ultimately, two patients required four surgical operations and another two cases required six operations.",

Streptococcus viridans was the predominant bacterium (75%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (38%), Enterococcus faecalis (31%) and Prevotella oris (31%) (Table 2). All antibiograms and resistograms included the following antibiotics: ampicillin, ceferoxime, clindamycin, erythromycin, penicillin, piperacillin and tazobactam. Clindamycin had an increased mechanism of resistance to all groups of microrganisms whereas tazobactam and piperacillin showed susceptibility to all isolated bacteria (Table 3).",

In all 16 cases of severe odontogenic abscesses we observed a premolar or molar mandibular focus and identified a need for postoperative respiratory assistance or tracheostomy. This is in accordance with recent literature [10, 17]. We recommend a preoperative CT-scan with contrast agent in cases with septic laboratory signs to obtain an exact overview of the extent of the abscess space. If the expected alleviation after initial surgical treatment with incision, drainage and perioperative antibiotic therapy is delayed, an immediate re-CT examination and targeted re-incision should be initiated without hesitation [6].

Current literature is controversial on whether irrigative or non-irrigative drainage tubes are superior [2]. From our experience, we prefer high-volume irrigation of the abscess cavity with isotonic saline solution (0.9%) in cases with septic progression. Our findings support this approach. The isolated pathogens of intraoperative swabs showed a typical polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria: Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant pathogens [1]. The initial calculated antibiotic therapy should focus on these pathogens to inhibit the risk of infection spreading and lower the risk of possible serious complications. Initiating a pathogen adapted antibiotic treatment as soon as possible with tazobactam and piperacillin in combination as first line medication is preferred. Patients that show CRP values above 200 mg/l and white blood cell counts greater than 19*1000/\u03bcl on admission require special attention. Our patients showed a noticeable decrease in their inflammation parameters during the second day after use of tazobactam and piperacillin.",
