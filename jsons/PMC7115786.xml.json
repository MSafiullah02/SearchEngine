            "text": "In grazing ruminants, diarrhoea may be caused by protozoan pathogens belonging to the genus Eimeria of the subclass Coccidia. In cattle, several Eimeria species have been shown to be capable of establishing clinical disease associated with watery to bloody diarrhoea, high morbidity, and, depending on which Eimeria species is dominant, high mortality rates as well. In the field, infections with more than one species were commonly found, but monoinfections were observed in some cases (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982, Svensson et al., 1993). Investigations performed in Sweden and Germany have unambiguously identified Eimeria alabamensis as the predominant species in grazing cattle with clinical coccidiosis. Other species frequently found were Eimeria bovis, Eimeria auburnensis, Eimeria zuernii, Eimeria ellipsoidalis and Eimeria bukidnonensis (Svensson et al., 1993, Svensson et al., 1994, Svensson, 1997). In Germany, clinical outbreaks of coccidiosis have occurred in grazing cattle in 17 herds from eight large cattle enterprises in the northern part of the former GDR (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982). In three herds, E. alabamensis monoinfections were recorded, and this species was predominant in ten of the remaining herds with polyinfections. Infections with E. bovis dominated in four herds, while in one herd the three species E. alabamensis, E. bovis, and E. zuernii were present. Experimental infections and data obtained during field studies have demonstrated that the prepatent period of E. alabamensis ranges between 6 and 10 days (Hooshmand-Rad et al., 1994, Svensson et al., 1994). Clinical symptoms started 3\u20137 days post experimental infection (Hooshmand-Rad et al., 1994) and were observed to become prevalent at 5 days following turnout on contaminated pasture (Svensson et al., 1994). Apart from watery diarrhoea, other symptoms shown by experimentally infected calves were poor appetite, depression, abdominal pain, and reduced growth rate (Hooshmand-Rad et al., 1994). Significant reduction in weight gain was also found in natural infections. Compared to calves kept on clean pastures, the difference amounted to more than 24 kg during a period of 24 days and actually resulted in weight loss of 18 kg during that time (Svensson et al., 1994). Mortality of E. alabamensis-infected cattle appears to be low and remains below 1% even when polyinfections are present (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982).",

Of the 130 animals for which diarrhoea was recorded, 72 were found to shed more than 100,000 E. alabamensis oocysts per gram. Also, the number of days on which animals showed diarrhoea was correlated with high oocyst shedding (0.39; p\n = 0.0001). Among the group of animals with high oocyst counts, this was particularly true for 24 animals where persistence of diarrhoea for more than 1 week up to the end of the study was observed, compared to a total of nine with lower counts. Within the latter group, only two animals showed diarrhoea later than 8 days post turnout. Accordingly, the number of days where animals showed high E. alabamensis oocyst counts correlated with the number of days when diarrhoea was present (0.28; p\n = 0.0003). Out of a total of 79 calves showing faeces with more than 100,000 oocysts per gram for at least 1 day, 72 had diarrhoea.",

The district in which the current investigation was performed represents one of the most intensive dairy areas in Germany. Following repeated reports about cases of first-year grazing calves showing diarrhoea and weight loss during the first weeks following turnout, the present study was initiated to investigate the possible involvement of coccidia. The pattern of E. alabamensis infections in first-year grazing calves is characterised by significant increases in oocsyt counts starting at approximately 7\u20139 days post turnout (Svensson, 2000). Infections are considered to be mainly caused by oocysts which persist on the pasture from the previous grazing season (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982, Svensson et al., 1993, Svensson et al., 1994). A similar scenario was encountered in the present study. However, the high degree of reproducibility with which the parasitological and clinical parameters developed throughout the conduct of the study at the different sites was unexpected. In all herds and in nearly all calves, E. alabamensis oocsyts were found, and in approximately 80% clinical Eimeriosis was diagnosed. The spectrum of Eimeria species encountered in the present study includes those found most often in an earlier study in northeastern parts of Germany (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982). Similarly, E. alabamensis and E. bovis were the most prevalent species. At turnout, a significant number of animals showed E. alabamensis-positive faecal samples in spite of the fact that this pathogen is considered to be an infection acquired during the first few days of grazing (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982, Svensson et al., 1993). However, it is also known that calves may be infected before turnout, which usually leads to the excretion of low oocyst numbers. E. alabamensis oocysts can be transmitted by feeding contaminated hay even when it has been stored for 8 months (Faber et al., 2002, Svensson, 1997). In-house infection and latent infections could relapse if animals are stressed during turnout (Levine, 1985). Reports have discussed a possible reactivation of arrested endogenous stages as a response to stress, such as unfavourable weather (Marquardt, 1976, Parker et al., 1986, Step et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Only a few reports are available on the clinical significance of naturally acquired bovine coccidiosis. Here, the calves on all farms started to show clinical symptoms of watery diarrhoea approximately 2 days before the increase in oocyst output began. Similar findings were reported in Swedish first-year grazing calves kept on permanent pastures which were proven to be contaminated in the previous year (Svensson, 2000). No animal died during the course of the present study, but one calf had to be treated palliatively. In the years preceeding and following this study, calves from the same farms have died, with signs of clinical coccidiosis during the first 2 months following turnout (data not shown). In contrast to E. bovis-dominated infections, coccidiosis predominantly caused by E. alabamensis is known to show a low morbidity. Nevertheless, such natural infections may contribute to reduced weight gain during the first months of grazing and may occasionally require treatment to avoid a fatal outcome of the disease. In the present study, infections with E. alabamensis were the most prevalent, showing the highest intensity in the faecal samples. Since E. bovis is more virulent than E. alabamensis, animals with E. bovis opg counts lower than 100,000 could also have been clinically affected, and these infections must also be considered as a cause of diarrhoea. Data from experimental (Hooshmand-Rad et al., 1994) but also natural (Svensson et al., 1994) E. alabamensis infections have shown that clinical signs of diarrhoea develop and peak within the first week post turnout. Essentially, the same was observed in the present study. In contrast, following infection with E. bovis and E. zuernii, the first signs of clinical disease are seen approximately 2\u20133 weeks post infection (Daugschies et al., 1986, Mundt et al., 2005). Therefore, the fact that diarrhoea began to develop after only 4 days post turnout in the herds investigated here, with the highest incidence at 6 days post turnout, suggests that the main cause of disease during this phase of the study can be attributed to infections with E. alabamensis. Furthermore, the low mean E. bovis and E. zuernii opg counts suggest that these pathogens did not unduly contribute to the clinical effects seen in this study.",

A sulphonamide bolus-based treatment, which has been studied in Sweden, was shown to be significantly effective in reducing weight loss and oocyst output in treated calves (Svensson, 1998). Immunisation has also been discussed as a possible option for prevention in preliminary investigations (Svensson et al., 1996). However, to date, the prophylactic and curative options are unsatisfactory in many countries. The known anti-coccidial compound toltrazuril has been shown to clinically cure Eimeria-infected calves and reduce oocyst output (Emanuel et al., 1988, Pilarczyk, 2001) but is not yet registered for use in cattle. From the data shown here, we conclude that clinical symptoms due to Eimeria spp. infections in endemic areas regularly occur during the first 1 or 2 weeks following turnout.",
