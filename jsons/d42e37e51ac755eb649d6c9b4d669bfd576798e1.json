Participants were allocated (1:1:1) at exacerbation onset to receive oral suspensions of amoxicillin-clavulanate (45 mg/kg per day) plus placebo azithromycin, azithromycin (5 mg/kg per day) plus placebo amoxicillin-clavulanate, or both placebos for 14 days. An independent statistician prepared a computer-generated, permuted-block (size 2-8) randomisation sequence, stratified by centre, age, and cause. Participants, caregivers, study coordinators, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment until data analysis was completed. The primary outcome was the proportion of children with exacerbation resolution by day 14 in the intention-to-treat population. Treatment groups were compared using generalised linear models. Statistical significance was set at p<0\u00b70245 to account for multiple comparisons. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612000011886) and is completed. Findings Between April 17, 2012, and March 1, 2017, 604 children were screened and 252 were enrolled. Between July 31, 2012, and June 26, 2017, 197 children were allocated at the start of an exacerbation (63 to the amoxicillinclavulanate group, 67 to the azithromycin group, and 67 to the placebo group).

[1] [2] [3] Bronchiectasis is characterised by acute respiratory exacerbations, which in children are associated with increased parental stress, impaired quality of life, and lung function decline in severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation. 4 Bronchiectasis guidelines advise treating exacer bations with antibiotics for 10-14 days. [5] [6] [7] The predominant pathogens detected in the lower airways of children with bronchiectasis are Haemophilus influenzae, Strepto coccus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, whereas (unlike in cystic fibrosis) Pseudomonas aeruginosa is uncommon. 2, 8 Accordingly, the combined Australian and New Zealand guidelines for bronchiectasis in children and adults recommend amoxicillin-clavulanate as the empirical firstline oral antibiotic for nonsevere exacerbations. 5 The 2019 British Thoracic Society guidelines for bronchiectasis in adults also recommend using oral amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for exacerbations in adults, while highlighting the absence of randomised placebo controlled trials. 7 Likewise, the latest European adult guidelines 6 refer to an earlier publication in which amoxicillin-clavulanate was recommended as the first option for acute exacerbations in patients without P aeruginosa infection. 9 Because young children are often unable to expectorate to provide reliable lower airway specimens, amoxicillinclavulanate is usually continued for the whole treatment course. Nevertheless, azithromycin, with its broad antimicrobial spectrum and convenient oncedaily dosing, has become a popular alternative to amoxicillinclavulanate. Indeed, in some regions of Australia, more than 50% of children undergoing bronchoscopy for chronic cough had received azithromycin in the preceding 2week period. 10 Our previous RCT showed that, after 21 days of treatment, oral azithromycin was noninferior (within a 20% margin) to amoxicillinclavulanate for managing nonsevere (nonhospitalised) exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis. 11 However, those receiving azithromycin took significantly longer (median difference 4 days) to achieve symptom resolution. Although azithromycin is noninferior to amoxicillin-clavulanate, no superiority RCTs comparing either of these antibiotics to placebo have been done to address the important clinical question of whether oral antibiotics are necessary to treat all nonsevere acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 183, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 184, "end": 187, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 188, "end": 191, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 428, "end": 429, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 520, "end": 523, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 524, "end": 527, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 528, "end": 531, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 774, "end": 776, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 777, "end": 778, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 991, "end": 992, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1234, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1283, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1454, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1952, "end": 1954, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2183, "end": 2185, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The role of antibiotics in the management of exacer bations of any severity has also been questioned by some experts, who have suggested that exacerbations triggered by viruses might be selflimiting. 12 In children, almost half of acute exacerbations are associated with viruses. 11, 13 As antimicrobial resistance is of increasing global concern, it is important to determine the efficacy of antibiotics for treating exacerbations. 14 Thus, in the absence of any published randomised placebocontrolled trials of oral antibiotics in either children or adults with an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis, we aimed to test whether two commonly used but different classes of oral antibiotics, namely amoxicillin-clavulanate and azithromycin, were superior to placebo in achieving resolution of nonsevere exacerbations by day 14 of treatment.

That study showed results at 2 weeks similar to our own with regard to achieving cough resolution (NNT 4 [95% ). 23 To the best of our knowledge, no other comparable paediatric studies have been done to date. An RCT in adults with moderate exacerbations of mildtomoderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) showed that 8 days of amoxicillinclavulanate was more effective than placebo, with an absolute difference in proportion cured of 14\u00b72% (95% CI 3\u00b77-24\u00b73; NNT 7). 24 However, these NNT values suggest that, although amoxicillin-clavulanate is efficacious, antibiotics are not always needed to achieve resolution of an exacerbation in bronchiectasis-an observation reported previously in adults with COPD. 25 Thus, studies to identify those children with bronchiectasis exacerbations who are most likely to benefit from antibiotics are needed. In contrast to oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin is not recommended as a firstline agent for treating non severe exacerbations of bronchiectasis. Nonetheless, we included this antibiotic in our RCT as it is commonly used in settings in which treatment adherence is problematic. 10, 26 Although both proportion of children with treatment resolution and median length of exacerbation were similar in the amoxicillin-clavulanate (resolution 65%, duration 7 days) and azithromycin (61%, 8 days) groups, the differences between azithromycin and placebo were not formally statistically significant. However, the duration of exacerbation could only be meaningfully calculated in those whose exacerbation had resolved by day 14 because the children who exited the study protocol or did not achieve resolution were given openlabel antibiotics per study protocol (and including them in the analysis would thus not reflect the true effect of intervention), and the number of children with resolution in placebo group was significantly lower than those in the antibiotic groups. Our previous RCT showed that, although 3 weeks of oral azithromycin treatment was noninferior (within a 20% margin) to 3 weeks of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate for achieving symptom resolution by day 21 in children with nonsevere exacerbations of bronchiectasis, 11 the episode duration was significantly shorter in children allocated to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (median duration 10 days [IQR [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] ) compared with azithromycin (14 days [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] ). This difference in duration is clinically significant because of the stress, anxiety, and loss of work for parents associated with bronchiectasis exacerbations. 4 Never theless, in the current study, when compared with placebo, both antibiotics by day 14 had similar effect sizes with respect to symptom resolution and episode duration. Indeed, the p value comparing azithromycin to placebo was 0\u00b7042, suggesting that statistical significance might have been achieved in a twoarm comparison between azithromycin and placebo (ie, without the need to adjust for multiple comparisons). Furthermore, given the higher thananticipated proportion of participants who achieved resolution in the placebo group, it is possible that this study was insufficiently powered to show statistical superiority of azithromycin. Taken together, this and our previous RCT 11 support the empirical use of amoxicillinclavulanate treatment as the firstline antibiotic choice for nonsevere exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children. Furthermore, data from this study indicate that azithro mycin increased the proportion of azithromycinresistant bacteria in the nasopharynx, which is a recognised reser voir for the transmission of antibioticresistant organisms. 27 Our RCT has additional limitations. First, the doses of antibiotics might not be the optimum doses for use in clinical practice. We used 45 mg/kg per day of the 7:1 amoxicillin-clavulanate formulation. Although 80 mg/kg per day amoxicillin is recommended for treating childhood pneumonia in settings where 30 although higher daily doses of 12 mg/kg for 5 days have been used in preschoolaged children with acute wheezing illnesses. 31 Second, some data on secondary outcomes were not available for all children. Paired PCQOL data were available for only 160 (81%) of 197 children (53 in the amoxicillin-clavulanate, 53 in the azithromycin, and 54 in the placebo groups); however, paired PCQOL data from at least 51 children in each group, based on a betweengroup difference of 0\u00b79 points (the minimum important difference), provides power of 99%. In addition, paired blood results and spirometry data were available for a small proportion of children in each group.

One child in the placebo group was uncontactable for 1 month after starting the study medication and (in accordance with our intentionto treat analysis plan) was thus deemed nonresolved before unmasking. 29 (43%) children in the placebo group had exacerbation resolution by day 14, compared with 41 (65%) children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group (RR for resolution 1\u00b750 [95% CI 1\u00b708-2\u00b709] vs placebo, p=0\u00b7015; NNT 5 [95% CI", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Characteristics of randomly allocated participants at enrolmentamoxicillin-clavulanate or the azithromycin group", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Characteristics of patients and exacerbations on day 1 of treatment", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "PC-QOL scores and laboratory and FEV", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Start of treatment (day 1) </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>End of treatment (day 14)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Placebo (n=47), n (%)\n</td><td>Amoxicillin-clavulanate (n=39)\n</td><td>Azithromycin (n=42)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Placebo (n=47), n (%)\n</td><td>Amoxicillin-clavulanate (n=39)\n</td><td>Azithromycin (n=42)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>n (%) </td><td>p value* </td><td>n (%) </td><td>p value* </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>n (%) </td><td>p value* </td><td>n (%) </td><td>p value*\n</td></tr><tr><td>Streptococcus pneumoniae </td><td>11 (23%) </td><td>4 (10%) </td><td>0\u00b711 </td><td>7 (17%) </td><td>0\u00b743 </td><td>6 (13%) </td><td>1 (3%) </td><td>0\u00b7085 </td><td>3 (7%) </td><td>0\u00b738\n</td></tr><tr><td>Azithromycin-resistant </td><td>4 (36%)\u2020 </td><td>1 (25%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b768 </td><td>1 (14%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b731 </td><td>2 (33%)\u2020 </td><td>0 </td><td>0\u00b750 </td><td>3 (100%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b7058\n</td></tr><tr><td>Penicillin-resistant </td><td>2 (18%)\u2020 </td><td>0 </td><td>0\u00b736 </td><td>0 </td><td>0\u00b723 </td><td>2 (33%)\u2020 </td><td>0 </td><td>0\u00b750 </td><td>1 (33%)\u2020 </td><td>1\u00b70\n</td></tr><tr><td>Haemophilus influenzae </td><td>13 (28%) </td><td>4 (10%) </td><td>0\u00b7044 </td><td>5 (12%) </td><td>0\u00b7065 </td><td>6 (13%) </td><td>0 </td><td>0\u00b7021 </td><td>2 (5%) </td><td>0\u00b719\n</td></tr><tr><td>Azithromycin-resistant </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>NA </td><td>0 </td><td>NA </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>NA </td><td>0 </td><td>NA\n</td></tr><tr><td>Ampicillin-resistant </td><td>3 (23%)\u2020 </td><td>1 (25%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b794 </td><td>0 </td><td>0\u00b724 </td><td>1 (17%)\u2020 </td><td>0 </td><td>NA </td><td>0 </td><td>0\u00b754\n</td></tr><tr><td>Moraxella catarrhalis </td><td>14 (30%) </td><td>12 (31%) </td><td>0\u00b792 </td><td>18 (43%) </td><td>0\u00b720 </td><td>15 (32%) </td><td>6 (15%) </td><td>0\u00b7076 </td><td>1 (2%) </td><td>&lt;0\u00b70001\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03b2-lactamase positive </td><td>14 (100%)\u2020 </td><td>12 (100%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b737 </td><td>17 (94%)\u2020 </td><td>NA </td><td>15 (100%)\u2020 </td><td>6 (100%)\u2020 </td><td>NA </td><td>1 (100%)\u2020 </td><td>NA\n</td></tr><tr><td>Staphylococcus aureus </td><td>8 (17%) </td><td>7 (18%) </td><td>0\u00b791 </td><td>5 (12%) </td><td>0\u00b750 </td><td>15 (32%) </td><td>5 (13%) </td><td>0\u00b7037 </td><td>3 (7%) </td><td>0\u00b70040\n</td></tr><tr><td>Azithromycin-resistant </td><td>3 (38%)\u2020 </td><td>2 (29%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b771 </td><td>1 (20%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b751 </td><td>3 (20%)\u2020 </td><td>2 (40%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b737 </td><td>2 (67%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b7010\n</td></tr><tr><td>Meticillin-resistant </td><td>1 (13%)\u2020 </td><td>3 (43%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b719 </td><td>2 (40%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b725 </td><td>2 (13%)\u2020 </td><td>2 (40%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b720 </td><td>0 </td><td>0\u00b750\n</td></tr><tr><td>Any of the above pathogens </td><td>32 (68%) </td><td>20 (51%) </td><td>0\u00b711 </td><td>22 (52%) </td><td>0\u00b713 </td><td>32 (68%) </td><td>11 (28%) </td><td>&lt;0\u00b70001 </td><td>8 (19%) </td><td>&lt;0\u00b70001\n</td></tr><tr><td>Azithromycin-resistant (any) </td><td>7 (22%)\u2020 </td><td>3 (15%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b754 </td><td>2 (9%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b722 </td><td>5 (16%)\u2020 </td><td>2 (18%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b784 </td><td>5 (63%)\u2020 </td><td>0\u00b70060\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "Data are n (%) of children with paired nasal swabs (on days 1 and 14 of treatment), unless otherwise specified.
