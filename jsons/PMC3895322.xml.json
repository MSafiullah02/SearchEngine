Zoonotic exposure is suspected as the source of human infection, in view of the initially sporadic occurrence of cases together with the genetic similarity of MERS-CoV to bat coronaviruses.6 However, epidemiological investigations of cases did not find a consistent pattern of exposure to animals or the environment,7 and, as of Aug 8, 2013, the virus had not been isolated from any animal species. Recently, however, camels from Oman and the Spanish Canary Islands were discovered to have been previously infected by the MERS-CoV or a closely related virus.8 The high apparent case-fatality ratio in reported cases is cause for concern: as of Aug 8, 2013, WHO reported that 46 of the 94 virologically confirmed cases had died;7 this death toll is expected to rise since some patients are still in hospital.9\n",

If the severe cases currently being detected represent only a small sentinel minority of a much larger number of milder cases (as occurred early in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Mexico11), the case-fatality ratio might be substantially lower than what current surveillance data suggest. Conversely, for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003, little evidence of undetected mild or subclinical infections existed,12 even after detailed serological follow-up studies.13 In the absence of robust community-based serological surveys for MERS-CoV, assessment of the extent of undetected infection must rely on epidemiological inference. Another essential aspect of risk assessment is the characterisation of transmissibility, and a study14 concluded that transmission levels were under the epidemic threshold in detected clusters.14 However, since stringent control measures were implemented in many of those clusters, the transmissibility in the absence of such controls is still unknown.",

Since the four returning non-resident traveller cases were clinically severe, this first analysis reflects missed severe clinical cases. This contrasts with the genetic analysis that estimates the number of all infections in both man and animals (albeit assuming the generation time of infection in the same in all species).

Based on this new dataset, we estimated the molecular clock rate at 1\u00b70 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year with 95% credibility interval (6\u00b78 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20131\u00b73 \u00d7 10\u22123) that overlaps the estimates of Cotten and colleagues.18 Based on this updated analysis, the updated TMRCA for all sequences was Oct 23, 2010 (95% CI Nov 28, 2008\u2013July 3, 2011), whereas that for the recent clade of now 11 isolates was March 29, 2012 (Nov 11, 2011\u2013June 7, 2012). The independent estimate of doubling time of the viral population in the recent clade is 43 days (95% CI 23\u2013104). Using available MERS-CoV genetic sequences the median estimate of cumulative infections (in man and in the reservoir) that occurred between March, 2012 (the TMRCA of the recent clade), and Aug 8, 2013, is 17 490 (IQR 3902\u201394 507).",

Our analysis demonstrates that the transmissibility of MERS-CoV in man is close to the critical threshold of R=1 required for self-sustaining transmission. If R is greater than 1, then the number of human cases we estimate to have occurred to date make it highly likely that self-sustaining transmission has already begun. If a human epidemic is underway, the low estimated value of R (<1\u00b73\u20131\u00b75) and evidence of severe infection in secondary cases from case clusters suggest that intensive public health measures around cases, coupled with improved case ascertainment, are sufficient to contain spread and reduce morbidity and mortality. However, an important caveat to this conclusion is the unknown extent of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infection and the role it might have in transmission.19 Our analysis indicates a high proportion of infections are not currently being detected. The reported case data therefore probably represent the severe end of a wider clinical spectrum of disease, though a case-fatality ratio higher than 10% cannot be ruled out from present data. Paradoxically, a low case-fatality ratio might make control more difficult, if mildly symptomatic cases prove to be responsible for most transmission.",
