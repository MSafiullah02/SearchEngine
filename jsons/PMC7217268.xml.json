Do we have enough reason to believe India may already have been exposed and many Indians may have recovered and be immune? The small increase in number of respiratory cases if any may have been barely noticeable due to the huge population and a relatively small percentage rise in people visiting emergency departments. India has a large young population, is it possible many had mild illness and recovered spontaneously. If we can understand this by widespread serological testing, we might be able to carbon date the epidemic better and will be able to understand the pace at which it is likely to spread in a more logical manner. Importantly, if at all we could do serological testing on healthcare workers who had sore throat symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 in the past 3 months, those with antibodies could be utilized as caregivers for SARS-CoV-2 patients.",

We assessed the relationship between malaria incidence rate (averaged annually) and corresponding numbers of SARS-CoV-2 cases as of date. As the dispersion of numbers of SARS-CoV-2 cases was very high, we took natural log of number of SARS-CoV-2 cases to normalize the value and post that calculated the correlation between malaria incidence rate and number of SARS- CoV-2 cases. As an outcome, we found that the incidence rate of malaria and natural log of number of SARS-CoV-2 cases were significantly inversely related at 95% confidence level (P < 0.0004) [Table 1 and Figure 1]. It clearly signifies that there is a negative correlation between number of SARS- CoV-2 cases and malaria incidence rate.",
