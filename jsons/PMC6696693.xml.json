For instance, we can match an assessed capacity, such as \u2018Documents\u2019, with the corresponding phase of the roadmap and implement interventions to guide improvements in this capacity area. Interventions can include developing and improving procedures for testing, increasing availability and quality of laboratory equipment, strengthening inventory management as well as biosafety practices.

This guidance includes testing for diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites and Rickettsia. It also includes testing conducted in preventive and check-up settings, such as for non-communicable diseases as well as chemicals and hazards in water, cosmetics, and the environment.

Our assessment scored capacity according to this guidance and assessed 82 categories of tests for each administrative level, which is approximately one-fifth, one-fourth, and one-half of the required categories of tests for provincial, prefectural and county levels.
