Most approaches are currently biased toward the identification of proteinacious epitopes on viruses, due to extensive pre-existent knowledge of protein chemistry and the limited size of viral genomes (which facilitates rapid sequencing and deduction of potential antigens). Here, techniques for mapping epitopes are reviewed and subdivided into those applicable to three scenarios, namely where native viral antigen is: (1) characterized and readily available, (2) known, but unavailable and, (3) completely unknown.
