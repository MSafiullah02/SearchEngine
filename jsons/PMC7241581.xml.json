Dose adjustments for renal function or extremes of weight should follow product labeling and/or institutional protocols.(b) For critically ill patients (i.e., in an ICU) with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19, we suggest increased doses of VTE prophylaxis (e.g., enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous twice daily, enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous twice daily, heparin 7500 units subcutaneous three times daily, or low-intensity heparin infusion [22, 24]). This suggestion is based largely on expert opinion. Dose adjustments for renal function or extremes of weight should follow product labeling and/or institutional protocols. Individual hospitals should determine which regimens best align with institutional experience and workflow. Several examples of institutional protocols for COVID-19 are available for review and use within the Anticoagulation Forum\u2019s Centers of Excellence Resources Center (https://acforum-excellence.org/Resource-Center/index.php).(c) For pregnant patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19, we recommend that providers collaborate closely with obstetric and anesthesia colleagues to determine optimal VTE prophylaxis dosing. Intermediate dosing regimens often used in the third trimester, as suggested by the American college of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) [25] and RCOG [26], may be a reasonable option for pregnant patients with COVID-19.(d) We recommend against using biomarker thresholds, such as elevated D-dimer, as the sole reason to trigger escalations in anticoagulant dosing outside the setting of a clinical trial.(e) For patients that are improving and transferring out of the ICU to the medical ward, it is reasonable to de-escalate to standard VTE prophylaxis dosing.\n",

If the baseline aPTT is normal, it is reasonable to monitor therapeutic UFH with either an anti-Xa assay or aPTT. We suggest that clinicians consider possible reasons (other than COVID-19) for baseline aPTT prolongation, as this laboratory finding could be due to an underlying coagulopathy that increases the risk of anticoagulant-associated bleeding.(e) We suggest using an anti-Xa assay rather than an aPTT to monitor therapeutic UFH in patients with COVID-19 who exhibit heparin resistance (typically defined as need for >35,000 units of heparin per 24 hours) as measured by the aPTT. If a patient does not exhibit heparin resistance, it is reasonable to monitor therapeutic UFH with either an anti-Xa assay or aPTT.

Anticoagulation beyond the initial 3-month period should be determined in accordance with existing guidelines for presumed hospital-associated VTE events [40].(c) In patients receiving empiric anticoagulation for a presumed but unconfirmed VTE, we suggest that delayed imaging not be used to determine if anticoagulation can be stopped before completing a three-month course.(d) We recommend that all patients be assessed for prehospital use of anticoagulation and that re-initiation of anticoagulation prior to discharge be based on a combination of pre-existing conditions (e.g., atrial fibrillation) and their COVID-19-related hospital course.(e) We recommend that all elements of an anticoagulation stewardship transition of care be included for patients with COVID-19 prior to hospital discharge on an anticoagulant.

This includes (but is not limited to) patients with mechanical heart valves, severe liver dysfunction, or combined renal dysfunction and/or drug-drug interactions that preclude safe DOAC use. Ability to reliably obtain and take DOACs is another important consideration when assessing eligibility to switch.(c) We suggest that clinics interested in transitioning patients from warfarin to a DOAC develop a standardized screening protocol to identify eligible patients.(d) We suggest that patients taking chronic oral anticoagulant in the outpatient setting be switched to shorter acting agents (e.g., LMWH or UFH) when initially hospitalized for COVID-19 in case of clinical deterioration, changes in renal function, or need for invasive procedures.\n",

The present recommendations aim to provide guidance for frontline clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19 and/or patients with chronic thrombotic conditions requiring ongoing management in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whenever possible, we recommend that clinicians rely on pre-COVID evidence-based principles of anticoagulation management combined with rational approaches to address unprecedented clinical challenges. As this area is rapidly evolving, it will be necessary to integrate additional evidence into our management recommendations. Fortunately, several clinical studies, including randomized controlled trials, are being conducted; the results will better inform our management decisions. Online resources, such as the Anticoagulation Forum Centers of Excellence Resource Center (https://acforum-excellence.org/) will be helpful in gathering and dissemination of these findings.",
