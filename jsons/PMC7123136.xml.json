The technique was developed in Boston under the lead of Edwin Joseph Cohn (1892\u20131953) and was made possible through the strong support of the US Department of Navy, the Office of Scientific Research and Development, and the wartime blood donor program of the American Red Cross (Cohn et al. 1944). Gamma globulin was enriched at high purity in fraction II of the Cohn-Oncley cold ethanol fractionation method (Oncley et al. 1949). This \u201cstandard IgG\u201d at increasing amounts became available from 1943 onward, a time point when the fractionation of albumin has been transferred to industry (Armour Pharma at Kankakee, IL, USA). Indeed, between 1944 and 1948, approximately 1 mio doses of \u201cstandard IgG\u201d were applied in the USA.",

Charles A. Janeway (1909\u20131981) was put in charge. At that time, he was running the infectious and immunology laboratory at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and was member of the Harvard Medical School Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, and in 1940 he furthermore joined the laboratory of Edwin J. Cohn in the Harvard Medical School Department of Physical Chemistry (Geha 2005; Rosen and Janeway 1994). After initial studies in 1941 in humans with bovine (fatal outcomes) and human serum albumin (successful), in 1943 he turned to study Cohn fraction II (+III), the plasma fraction(s) enriched in IgG. The initial studies largely remained restricted to the prevention or attenuation of viral infections, particularly of measles infections (Ordman et al. 1944). The initial restriction to viral diseases probably was because from the late 1930s onward, the dawn of antibiotic treatment, Janeway built up an outstanding expertise in the treatment of bacterial infections with these emerging new drugs (Smith 1977).",

Applying plasma electrophoresis to the serum of an 8-year-old boy, he realized an association between recurrent severe infections (starting at an age of four and a half years of age) and a very low gamma globulin in serum. In an attempt to reduce susceptibility to infections, he administered \u201cstandard IgG\u201d subcutaneously and demonstrated an increase of gamma globulin in blood, clinically a decrease of infections. Some remarkable facts of Bruton\u2019s work have to be highlighted: (a) despite the overwhelming position of the Boston group, he selected the less painful subcutaneous route of administration for his young patient; (b) he detected a new disease; and (c) he provided the therapy. Although less painful, at that time, only low doses of \u201cstandard IgG\u201d could be administered via this route, and the need for i.v. preparations allowing administration of larger doses became evident (again).",

Other manufacturers applied other techniques to get rid of IgG aggregates or to render them non-complement activating. Much progress in polishing steps was made leading to different products with lyophilized or liquid formulation needing different stabilizers (Cherin et al. 2016).",

            "text": "The worst of the adverse events with IgG concentrates which occurred after the WHO/IUIS recommendation was the transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV; \u201chepatitis non-A, non-B\u201d termed at that time) by some polyvalent IgG preparations (Lane 1983; Lever et al. 1984; Stephan and Dichtelm\u00fcller 1983; Weiland et al. 1986; Welch et al. 1983; Williams et al. 1989) as well as with an anti-D immunoglobulin prepared in the former German Democratic Republic. It became apparent that Cohn fractionation II of human plasma alone was limited in its capacity to inactivate transmissible viruses while products remained free from the threat of virus transmission, particularly those prepared by the Kistler-Nitschmann fractionation technique, most likely due to the low pH applied at polishing. Several patients infected by HCV experienced a severe course of infection and a few died (Bj\u00f6rkander et al. 1988; Razvi et al. 2001) making viral safety a crucial issue for IgG products (Cuthbertson et al. 1987). Driven by the virus transmission risks of blood transfusion and the obvious elevated risk of virus transmission by coagulation factor concentrates, authorities always orient themselves to the highest risk level and require accordingly measures to guarantee product safety. IgG therapy on one hand comprises a particular set of risks, while on the other hand the fractionation technique and the polishing steps offer particular opportunities for virus inactivation/removal. The particular risks with IgG therapy are:Economic reasons force manufacturers to manipulate at once large volumes of pooled plasma.One contaminated plasma unit can contaminate thus a large pool.One lot of IgG concentrate has many vials for clinical use.The many vials are applied to a certain (high) number of patients and in case of contamination infections are usually clustered in a patient population.Recipients might be individuals with genetically impaired antibody production. Such patients are particularly vulnerable to infections. Such patients receive IgG concentrates for replacement therapy possibly lifelong, and patients are prolonged and repeatedly exposed to (a theoretical) risk of pathogen transmission.Patients with inherited immunodeficiency might need lifelong replacement therapy which exposes them to repeated risk of virus transmission.Patients with chronic autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases are treated with \u201cimmunomodulatory\u201d doses of IgG. The doses are high and usually are applied repeatedly, and this again exposes patients to an elevated level of risk for pathogen transmission (Table 10.1).\n\n",

S.c. products are increasingly studied in chronic autoimmune/inflammatory conditions, e.g., chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), and various dermatological and collagen-vascular diseases. Results from clinical trials will be available soon. Whether or not ITP can be treated by s.c. route remains to be clarified. One boy with ataxia telangiectasia developed ITP while being on s.c. replacement for his immunodeficiency (Heath and Goldman 2010).",
