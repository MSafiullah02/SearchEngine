Drug reaction is another important cause of erythroderma, implicated in 20% of cases, with at least 135 drugs suspected as potential causative agents [5] [6] [7] [8] 10] . A common malignancy associated with erythroderma is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) [3, 7, 9] . Idiopathic erythroderma, where no cause can be elucidated despite thorough serial investigations, occurs in approximately 30% of cases. \"Red man's syndrome\" associated with rapid vancomycin infusion is considered to be an example of idiopathic erythroderma [3-5, 8, 10, 11] .",
