Each homotrimer is comprised of a large globular head that binds to glycan receptors and a distal stem region.10,11 Haemagglutinin is the target of neutralizing antibodies in the context of pandemic influenza 200912 and often described as the immunogenicity-defining surface protein of influenza viruses.11,13,14 Therefore, we mapped in this study the serum IgG epitope recognition profiles after a natural pandemic flu infection and Pandemrix\u00ae vaccination using a high content influenza peptide microarray.15,16",

Up to now, immunological differences between time-points (e.g. before/after flu vaccination) or between different patient groups were assayed by ELISA.22 Using this method, only increase in titres or reactivity to different targets could be measured. However, recognition of recombinant proteins in ELISA usually represents recognition of 20\u201340 different epitopes (linear and conformational). Peptide array screening is a feasible way to map differences in humoral immune responses, though an important limitation may be the exclusion of conformational epitopes, as described in recent reports.23,24 The epitope-mapping analysis was possible in the current study using material from a prospective study,25\u201327 in which 2000 individuals were followed before and after vaccination, or H1N1 infection.",

The detectable spots that are not internally uniform are flagged as \u2018bad\u2019 (i.e. unreliable). This is efficiently estimated by the following criterion (described in detail elsewhere16).\n which identifies the spots with a mean foreground value different from the spots exhibiting median fluorescence intensity values. The spots were visually inspected after flagging and the results were saved separately for each sub-array. The positive control spots in each sub-array were selected after careful screening, as described previously.29 Two paired strategies were adopted in this context: differential recognition of epitopes, i.e. peptides exhibiting statistically different recognition from immunoglobulin present in the test group compared with the control group, (strong recognition in one group versus weak or no recognition in the other group), as well as \u2018exclusive recognition\u2019 of peptide targets that are recognized above a defined threshold for detection in serum from a test group but never in a control group (or vice versa).15,16,29,30 The epitope mapping on the crystal structure of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus HA (PDB ID-3LZG)31 and HA receptor-binding domain (PDB ID -3MLH)32 were performed using the protein databank Jmol, an open-source Java viewer for chemical structures using a three-dimensional application (http://www.jmol.org).33",

One salient finding is the pre-existing serum IgG to pandemic HA in vaccinated individuals before the onset of the flu season, probably due to past exposures and previous vaccinations (the interviews of the study participants showed that individuals who chose to be vaccinated did so previously, before 2009/2010 and vice versa.27) Not only pre-existing serum IgG, resulting from previous flu vaccinations, but also pre-existing protective antibodies from past exposures to H1 strains37\u201340 may contribute to this humoral response. A broader pandemic flu epitope recognition pattern is reflected in 10 shared pandemic influenza epitopes in serum from individuals before the flu season onset, as well as in seven epitopes from pandemic flu internal proteins in serum from individuals who chose to be vaccinated. The biological role of these antibodies, directed to internal proteins, is not clear. Previous reports suggested that non-neutralizing antibodies may decrease morbidity and lead to increased viral clearance through binding to Fc receptors and subsequently to CD8 cells.41\u201345 Conserved influenza internal proteins may therefore help to elicit memory B cells that are long-lived46,47 and contribute to heterosubtypic immunity during antigenic drifts.",

This epitope GWLLGNPECDLLLTA from the HA of (Spanish flu) was recognized by serum immunoglobulin at both pre- and post-vaccination time-points (see Supporting information, Tables S1 and S2), supporting the notion that IgG to the Spanish flu may be able to induce cross-protection against the 2009 pandemic flu.

This reactivity was completely absent from the IgG-epitope recognition repertoire of the flu-infected individuals before and after the flu season. Most likely, this epitope represents a dominant response associated with repetitive flu vaccination (the interviews of the study participants indicated as previous to 2009/2010 influenza vaccination). A rabbit mono-specific antibody directed against this epitope was prepared that did not neutralize the pandemic flu in vitro; functional significance of this epitope could not be established. A possible explanation is that a 15-mer linear peptide that was used to immunize the rabbits does not resemble the same folding of this epitope within the native protein. However, the antibodies detected in serum from vaccinated individuals against this epitope may activate complement and subsequently contribute to virus neutralization in a biological system.56,57 This test was beyond the scope of the study, since epitope-specific complement-activating human reagents were not available. Future experiments will also need to address whether high-avidity antibodies from flu-protected individuals58,59 can be identified with the peptide microarray assay and whether the target epitopes could be used for guided vaccine development. Although the current study may be limited because only IgG directed against linear epitopes could be characterized with conformational epitopes being missed, a distinct IgG recognition pattern was identified. These patterns segregated based on H1N1 infection and vaccination and could be clearly linked to a clinically relevant endpoint: flu infection leads to a different array of epitope recognition compared with the flu vaccine. Immune profiling of individuals, protected from infectious pathogens, may help to tailor new vaccine candidates and help to identify clinically relevant markers of immune protection.",
