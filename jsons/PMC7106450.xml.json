One of the natural reservoirs of EHEC strains is the intestinal tract of ruminants, especially cattle, where they can survive in the presence of mucus-derived carbohydrates (Aperce et al., 2014; Bertin et al., 2013; Fox et al., 2009). EHEC O157:H7 strains have caused numerous cases and outbreaks during the last decades (Page and Liles, 2013) Most strains of this serotype express Shiga toxin (Stx) 1 and/or Stx2 with their different variants and the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), encoding a type III secretion system (Scheutz et al., 2011; Stevens and Frankel, 2014). The first reported EHEC O157:H7 outbreak occurred in 1982 where at least 47 people developed diarrhea in Michigan and Oregon after consuming contaminated meat in a fast-food restaurant (Riley et al., 1983). One of the strains that have been isolated during this outbreak was EDL933 (O\u2019Brien et al., 1993). Up to now, this is one of the best-characterized EHEC O157:H7 strains worldwide and was therefore used in the current study.",

Infecting EHEC strains may evade host defence, gain access to growth substrates and overcome colonization resistance mechanisms (Stecher and Hardt, 2011). They replicate in the colon during the course of infection, but up to now, the mechanisms of competition with the microbiota and carbon nutrition are only poorly understood. An important carbon source for EHEC are breakdown products of the gastrointestinal mucus that are produced by the host in high amounts each day (Conway et al., 2004). Many commensal gut microorganisms attain required C- and N-sources from mucin glycoproteins (Johansson et al., 2009, 2011; Marcobal et al., 2013). Endowed with various glycoside hydrolases and exploiting synergistic mechanisms between them they are well adapted to grow in the mucus environment (Marcobal et al., 2013).",

To get access to the limited nutrients in large intestine, replication of EHEC strains depends on mechanisms to compete at least for one of the mucus-derived carbohydrates or to be otherwise metabolically flexible (Conway and Cohen, 2015). Commensal non-pathogenic E. coli represent presumably the major competitors in the gut, because they exhibit a similar genetic background as EHEC do. Thus, the expression of additional genes involved in sugar catabolism, which are located on genetic mobile elements in EHEC, is imperative for the assertiveness of EHEC towards commensal E. coli. Mucus-derived sugars as fucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) can be utilized by EHEC as well as by commensal E. coli (Aperce et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2004; Fabich et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Neu5Ac is an \u03b1-keto sugar with a nine-carbon backbone, typically found terminally linked to glycan chains of mammalian mucins. Neu5Ac is highly abundant in glycans of the large intestine (Robbe et al., 2003), where E. coli preferentially colonizes, compared to the small intestine (Barnett Foster, 2013; Torres et al., 2005). N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is the hydroxylated derivative of Neu5Ac carrying an OH-group in the N-acetyl chain at carbon C5. Neu5Gc is generated by the enzyme CMP-Neu5Ac-hydroxylase, which is expressed as functional enzyme in all mammals except humans, who produce an inactive enzyme due a deletion in the corresponding chromosome (Peri et al., 2018). Although humans lack a functioning CMP-Neu5Ac-hydroxylase, Neu5Gc has been found in low quantities in human mucins most likely due to catabolic incorporation from nutritional Neu5Gc derived from red meat (Varki and Schauer, 2009). Furthermore, neuraminic acids exhibit a large heterogeneity in the gut with respect to structural modifications of their hydroxyl groups. A very common modification is the O-acetylation with up to four O-acetyl residues at carbon atoms C4, C7, C8 and C9 (Varki and Schauer, 2009; Vimr, 2013). Neu5Ac is the major sialic acid present in mucin, followed by the mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac-variants Neu5,9Ac2, Neu5,7Ac2 and Neu5,8Ac2. Less common are the di-O-acetylated Neu5Ac-species Neu5,8,9Ac3 and Neu5,7,9Ac3 (Robbe et al., 2003).",

Neu5Ac inactivates the repressor NanR, whereby the nan-operons are activated and sialic acids are catabolized (Rangarajan et al., 2011). While Neu5Ac is directly taken up by the transporter NanT, O-acetylated sialic acids have to be deacetylated first (Steenbergen et al., 2009). NanS is an N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid esterase, which deacetylates mono-O-acetylated Neu5,9Ac2 to Neu5Ac, which is then transported by NanT and utilized as an energy source. It has been shown that NanS is also able to deacetylate mono-O-acetylated Neu5,8Ac2, but not the Neu5,7Ac2 or Neu5,4 Ac2 isomeric structures (Steenbergen et al., 2009).",

Recently, the enzymatic characteristics of recombinantly expressed NanS-p1, NanS-p2, and NanS-p4 of strain EDL933 were determined and an N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid esterase activity was detected for the three enzymes. The three variants were investigated as representatives of the EDL933 NanS-p and were selected due to phylogenetic reasons (Saile et al., 2016). For analysis of the role of NanS-p, several nanS and nanS-p deletion mutants have been constructed up to a supermutant that did not contain any nanS or nanS-p genes, and their role in substrate utilization has been demonstrated (Saile et al., 2016). Compared to nanS, the nanS-p genes harbour additional nucleotides downstream of the SGNH hydrolase-like domain and a DUF1737 domain. The function of the DUF1737 domain is still unknown (Rangel et al., 2016; Saile et al., 2016).",

Sialidases are substrate-specific and the decoration of sialic acids with one or more O-acetyl residues prevents sialidases from enzymatic cleavage. The activity of sialidases increases upon removal of O-acetyl groups from sialic acids by sialate O-acetylesterases (Phansopa et al., 2015). B. thetaiotaomicron, for example, represents a commensal of the gut, that produces a number of glycoside hydrolases such as the B. thetaiotaomicron sialidase BTSA (Park et al., 2013), enabling this microorganism to release terminally bound sialic acids from mucin.",

In order to explore the activity and specificity of purified NanS and NanS-p, we cloned His-tagged nanS, nanS-p1, nanS-p2, and nanS-p4 and expressed the enzymes in laboratory E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) following IPTG induction as described above. Cells were lysed and recombinant enzymes were purified with Ni-NTA-columns, followed by determining their purity and concentration by SDS-PAGE and Bradford staining. NanS-His, NanS-p1-His, NanS-p2-His and NanS-p4-His were incubated for 2 h with mono-O-acetylated Neu5,9Ac2 or Neu5,4 Ac2; samples of Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu5,4 Ac2 without enzymes served as controls. After enzyme treatment, we qualitatively analysed the extent of O-acetylation by means of HPTLC (see above). The results of the exposure of Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu5,4 Ac2 with the EHEC O-acetylesterases are shown in Fig. 1\nA and Fig. 1B, respectively.",

Consequently, we used BSM as a source for mucin-bound Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc and their diverse O-acetylated derivates, which are components of highly sialylated O-glycans of BSM as proposed in the manufacturer\u2019s data sheet (Merck, Darmstadt).

Afterwards, the chemically released sialic acids were identified by nanoESI MS. Mass spectra of sialic acids obtained after exposure of BSM to the recombinant O-acetylesterases are exemplarily shown for NanS-His and NanS-p1-His in Fig. 2B and 2C, respectively. Identified sialic acids with the corresponding ion species and their m/z values are listed in Table 2B and C, respectively. Spectra of BSM-derived sialic acids upon exposure to NanS-His or NanS-p1-His evidenced predominant Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc core structures, accompanied by weaker signals, which could be assigned to mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc(OAc) species and the di-O-acetylated Neu5Ac(OAc)2 derivative. Importantly, Neu5Ac(OAc)3 and Neu5Gc(OAc)3 variants, which appear in the spectra at m/z 458.13 and m/z 474.13, respectively, were undetectable after O-acetylesterase treatment. Similar results were obtained with recombinant NanS-p2-His and NanS-p4-His (data not shown). Our results show that NanS as well as NanS-p are able to release acetyl residues not only from mono-O-acetylated sialic acids, but also from di- and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids as demonstrated for Neu5Ac(OAc)2, Neu5Ac(OAc)3, and their di- and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Gc counterparts.

Co-incubation of BSM with BTSA-His and O-acetylesterases revealed Neu5Ac only, while Neu5,9Ac2 could not be detected. Due to the suggested capability of NanS-His and its homologs to deacetylate mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids, the above described digests were repeated and the released sialic acids were detected using mass spectrometry. For this purpose, proteins of the digests were precipitated with methanol and the supernatants were directly applied to nanoESI MS. Mass spectra of sialic acids obtained from digests of BSM using BTSA-His alone, BTSA-His combined with NanS-His and BTSA-His combined with NanS-p1-His are shown in Fig. 4\nA, 4B and 4C, respectively. Identified sialic acids with the m/z values of the corresponding ions are listed in Table 3A\u2013C, respectively. The mass spectrum obtained from BSM exposed to BTSA-His alone (Fig. 4A) shows ions derived from Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc basic structures and Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc(OAc) (listed in Table 3\nA). Thus, BTSA-His was capable to cleave off Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc as well as the mono-O-acetylated counterparts from glycans. Di- and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids were not detected and hence not released by BTSA-His. The combination of BTSA-His with the O-acetylesterases NanS-His or NanS-p1-His revealed ions indicating liberated Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc as shown in the mass spectra of Fig. 4B (listed in Table 3B) and Fig. 4C (listed in Table 3C), respectively. Both combined approaches revealed Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc but no O-acetylated sialic acids. The combination of BTSA-His and NanS-p2-His or NanS-p4-His gave the same results (data not shown).",

Sialic acids are highly abundant in the large intestine, where they decorate the mucus layer(s) in terminally exposed positions on the mucin O-glycans. Sialic acids can be modified by up to three acetic acid esters at the positions of the hydroxyl groups of the sialic acid core including Neu5Gc species, whereby Neu5Gc and its derivatives do exist in all mammals except humans (Robbe et al., 2003; Varki and Schauer, 2009; Vimr, 2013). While pure Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc are readily cleavable by bacterial sialidases, O-acetylation protects them from enzymatic hydrolysis (Juge et al., 2016). The intestinal E. coli strains are generally considered competitors for EHEC strains owing to their similar genetic background. Both groups harbor genes for sialic acid metabolism and are able to utilize free sialic acids as carbon and nitrogen sources. Compared to commensal nonpathogenic E. coli, EHEC harbor several phage-encoded NanS homologs (NanS-p) (Saile et al., 2016, 2018). These enzymes catalyze de-O-acetylation of Neu5,9Ac2 to Neu5Ac, which after sialidase action can be taken up and metabolized by both, commensal and pathogenic E. coli (Saile et al., 2016, 2018). Currently, it is not known, why EHEC strains contain a chromosomal nanS gene and multiple prophage-associated nanS-p genes. One hypothesis is that multiple nanS-p genes confer a gene dose effect to ensure substrate utilization and to outcompete commensal E. coli in the gut (Saile et al., 2016).",

NanoESI MS spectra of chemically released sialic acids from BSM revealed ion signals of mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc derivatives. NanS and NanS-p were capable to de-O-acetylate such O-acetylated sialic acids of BSM as determined by nanoESI MS analysis. Since various of the known microbial 9-O-acetylesterases are unable to de-O-acetylate Neu5,4 Ac2, we probed the specificity of NanS and the NanS-p esterases with respect to cleavage of the acetyl ester at C4 of Neu5Ac. HPTLC analysis revealed that neither NanS nor the NanS-p esterases are able to split off the O-acetyl group from this position. Mass spectra of NanS- or NanS-p-treated mucin still exhibited ion signals of O-acetylated sialic acids. Since O-acetyl groups are mostly located at position C4 and/or C9, it is tempting to speculate that the detected mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac-species represent the Neu5,4 Ac2 isomer.

However, de-O-acetylation results in sialidase-accessible Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc basic structures, which are common substrates of commensal sialidases, e.g., BTSA of B. thetaiotaomicron. In order to verify this hypothesis, we probed the removal of BSM-bound sialic acids with BTSA-His. This sialidase hydrolyzes pure Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc and also the mono-O-acetylated counterparts Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc(OAc).

Even though B. thetaiotaomicron encodes sialidases, this bacterium lacks the nan operon and is unable to utilize released sialic acids as a nutrient. Therefore, the complementary action of both enzymes may result in a higher content of free sialic acids in the gut. In order to assess the growth-promoting effect of a mixed enzyme treatment, we cultivated the EHEC O157:H7 wildtype strain EDL933, and its mutant strains EDL933\u0394nanS and EDL933\u0394nanS\u0394nanS-p1a-p7 on mucin, mucin supplemented with BTSA-His and mucin exposed to BTSA-His combined with NanS-p-His. The combination revealed a significantly enhanced bacterial growth suggesting that EHEC exploits sialidases of commensal gut bacteria, and is supported by own O-acetylesterases to get access to O-glycan-derived sialic acids of intestinal mucus. On principle, sialic acids per se and particularly the O-acetylated species prevent from subsequent digest of desialylated glycans by glycosidases (Phansopa et al., 2015). Collectively, the sialidase-mediated release of sialic acids combined with complementary saponification of acetic acid side chains allows for ensuing stepwise digest of desialylated glycans by glycosidases such as galactosidases, N-acetylhexosaminidases or fucosidases. It can be speculated that the primary role of NanS-p esterases during infection could be the perturbation of the mucus layer integrity and initiation of commensal degradation, which may enable or at least facilitate EHEC strains crossing of the mucus barrier and getting access to the epithelial cells in the colon.",
