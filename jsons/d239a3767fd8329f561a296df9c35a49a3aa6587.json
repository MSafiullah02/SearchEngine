Emergency surgery is still a priority. Functional surgery is to be deferred. Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk. The question looms large in cancer surgery-go ahead or defer? There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery. For each type of cancer-colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma-morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery. For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For rectal cancers T3-4 and/or N+, chemoradiotherapy is indicated, short radiotherapy must be discussed (followed by a waiting \u0b1d NB: French speakers are advised to use the TNCD updates.

On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the epidemic of Covid-19 had become a pandemic. Everywhere in the world, public authorities are recommending strengthened preventive hygiene measures that call on the public's civic responsibility. Epidemiological peaks and the seriousness of the acute respiratory distress syndromes threaten to swamp our resuscitation and intensive care provision. Our governments are taking necessary measures to 'flatten the curve' and spread out over time the influx of cases requiring hospitalization. Meanwhile, they are taking measures to increase our conventional hospital and intensive care capacities.",

On 12 March the government instructed ''all hospitals to promptly de-schedule all non-urgent surgery requiring post-operative recovery and resuscitation or continuous monitoring, without adversely affecting patients' lifechances. Special attention is required for patients in care for cancer. The purpose of this measure is both to free up beds in recovery and resuscitation wards, and to avoid exposing patients recently operated on to a harmful virus infection.'' A recent article published by our Chinese colleagues [1] suggests that patients with cancer are more likely to be infected by the virus because of their immunodepressed state induced by their cancer, their chemotherapy and their surgery. The article also emphasizes that these patients are at higher risk of developing severe episodes (39% vs. 8%). Patients who have been operated on or who have undergone anticancer chemotherapy in the month preceding the appearance of the virus had a higher risk (75%) of developing a severe episode than those who had not undergone surgery or chemotherapy (43%). This study admittedly concerns only a small number of patients, and its scientific soundness can be easily criticized, but decisions will have to be made before more powerful scientific findings become available.",

Patients operated on or undergoing chemotherapy in the months preceding the infection had a serious form of infection in 75% of cases, representing a relative risk calculated by multivariate analysis of 5.34 (CI95% 1.80-16.18, P = 0.0026) [1] .
