            "text": "To the Editor I n the time of an airborne pandemic, institutions must adapt and launch innovative strategies to keep patients and staff safe. This is challenging given the novelty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), threat of dwindling hospital supplies, and limited knowledge of new airway management recommendations-all with the added barrier of social distancing. Anesthesiologists are uniquely positioned to create and implement strategies for safe airway management of patients with COVID-19 to minimize exposure to aerosolization. 1 To address these issues, we worked with a multidisciplinary team consisting of anesthesiologists, intensivists, emergency medicine faculty, otolaryngologists, nurses, and respiratory therapists. Our goal was to create safe, standardized processes to implement current recommendations 3 for airway management of COVID unknown or positive patients throughout the hospital. While innovations such as the COVID Kit 4 are necessary, we focused on a system able to adapt to the nuances of significantly varying environments ranging from the radiology induction area to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU). We created our guidelines with the intention of hospital-wide generalizability as well as for the wide range of ages served by our pediatric institution.",

In addition, we created and distributed \"COVID Packs\" containing a novel plastic drape barrier system for airway management. 6 We also created original checklists and job aids with recommendations for required personnel and supplies to minimize staff exposure as well as waste. We conducted several simulated intubations in the operating room (OR), emergency department (ED), and ICU. These simulations helped us to prepare 5 for the surge of COVID-positive patients and to create a space for problem solving and innovation and, in both cases, incorporating each locations' needs, capabilities, and limitations.",

These devices should ideally be connected to the oxygen delivery device before intubation to minimize future circuit disconnects. The team reviewed details regarding HEPA filter deadspace (important for neonates), filter lifespan in an intubated patient, and potential scarcity before implementation. Additional information about in-line suction catheters (eg, deadspace and sizing to the endotracheal tube) was gleaned and staff education was disseminated in these sessions. Simulations of intubations and transfers to the ventilator using these devices demonstrated the importance of the sequence of these attachments relative to the endotracheal tube and reduction of prefilter disconnections.",
