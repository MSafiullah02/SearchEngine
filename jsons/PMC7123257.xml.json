            "text": "Perioperative hemorrhage, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy are common in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Indeed, it is suggested that between 5 % and 7 % of cardiac surgical patients lose more than 2 L of blood in the first 24-h postoperatively [1]. Similarly, it has been estimated that 1.5 % of patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy experience hemorrhage requiring at least four units of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion [2], and up to 9 % of patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant experience abdominal bleeding requiring radiologic intervention or re-laparotomy [3]. Accordingly, anemia is frequently observed on admission to the ICU, with a substantial proportion of the remaining patients becoming anemic during their admission [4]. In addition, around 40 % of critically ill patients have thrombocytopenia or other derangements in coagulation parameters at some point during their ICU stay [5\u20137]. Thus it is not surprising that blood product transfusion is common practice in the ICU. Indeed for decades, RBC, plasma, and platelet transfusions were given seemingly ubiquitously to alleviate their respective laboratory derangements. While these blood products clearly play a life-sustaining role in the setting of major trauma or life-threatening hemorrhage, in an era of evidence-based medicine, the safety and efficacy of transfusion in hemodynamically stable patients has been increasingly called into question.",

            "text": "Though a degree of clinical equipoise persists, a substantial and growing body of evidence supports the notion that liberal transfusion of blood products portends an increased risk for adverse patient outcomes, including in-hospital and 30-day mortality, infection, ARDS, and multi-organ dysfunction [8\u201310]. This, coupled with the known intrinsic risks of blood product transfusion (discussed below), has resulted in refinement of transfusion recommendations\u2014with a shift toward more conservative practice. Despite this, the ICU remains one of the highest utilizers of blood products in the hospital [4, 11]. In the United States, an estimated 24,000,000 blood products are transfused each year [12], with approximately 40 % of critically ill patients receiving at least one unit of RBCs [4], and one out of every two patients receiving at least one allogeneic blood product during their ICU admission [11]. Concerningly, evidence suggests that many of these blood product transfusions are being given outside of published guidelines\u2014for example, for the correction of stable asymptomatic anemia, or for correction of abnormal coagulation parameters in the absence of bleeding [13]. Improving the appropriateness of blood product transfusion in the ICU will require careful assessment of the known risks and benefits. In this chapter, we outline the contemporary evidence-based indications for blood product transfusions, their efficacy and risks. In addition, we describe recent changes with regard to massive transfusion as well as upcoming blood product alternatives.",

            "text": "In the 1980s, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic and concern for transfusion-transmitted infections incited a re-examination of the risk-to-benefit ratio of RBC transfusion in the perioperative setting [19]. While advances in donor screening and blood product testing have substantially mitigated concerns regarding transfusion-transmitted disease, the debate about RBC safety is ongoing\u2014primarily driven by questions of efficacy and other patient-important outcomes. In 1999, the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) randomized trial compared a liberal (transfusion trigger, Hb < 10 g/dL) versus restrictive (transfusion trigger, Hb < 7 g/dL) transfusion strategy and concluded that in-hospital mortality was significantly reduced in the restrictive group [20]. While this study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in 30-day mortality for \u201call comers,\u201d subgroup analysis of 30-day mortality in those with lower APACHE II scores (<20) and <55 years of age was significantly reduced in the restrictive group [20]. Importantly, no adverse effects of the restrictive strategies were observed, however noticeably fewer RBCs were utilized [20]. This study was pivotal to modern transfusion practice, and subsequently leads to the generation of guidelines purporting a transfusion trigger of Hb < 7 g/dL. Similar studies have replicated these findings in a variety of patient populations including cardiovascular [21] and orthopedic surgery [22] as well as gastrointestinal bleeding [23], each concluding that either liberal transfusion did not confer a morbidity or mortality benefit, or that restrictive transfusion actually resulted in a higher probability of survival at 6 weeks, less bleeding, and fewer complications relative to the liberal transfusion group [21\u201323]. In addition, a number of observational studies support restrictive transfusion, noting that RBC transfusions may be associated with worse clinical outcomes [4, 24]. These studies hypothesize that restrictive transfusion strategies result in reduced exposure to the potentially harmful effects of transfusion therapies, and as such result in a reduced incidence of adverse events when compared to liberal transfusion.",

Rather, consideration of patient-specific symptoms and risks is paramount, and clinical judgment should be exercised with each blood product that is administered. In modern medical practice, efforts to minimize unnecessary RBC transfusion are hinged upon three key points; first recent evidence supports the notion that restrictive transfusion practice in hemodynamically stable patients is at least as safe and effective as liberal transfusion practice, and possibly superior. Second is the increasing awareness of the risks of transfusion, and third relates to the scarcity of RBCs, resource utilization, and the associated healthcare costs.",

            "text": "In 2009, the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Eastern Association of Surgery for Trauma developed joint clinical practice guidelines for RBC transfusion [11]. Considering all available literature at that time, the single most irrefutable indication for RBC transfusion remains acute hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability, inadequate oxygen delivery or shock. Outside of the setting of acute hemorrhage, conservative transfusion practices (RBC transfusion only when Hb falls < 7 g/dL) are recommended for most critically ill patients with stable anemia, including those presenting with trauma, requiring mechanical ventilation or with known stable coronary disease. Furthermore, in all situations, it is recommended that only single unit transfusion takes place before reevaluation of the need for additional RBC transfusion. Notably, these guidelines recognize a possible exception to this standard of care. For patients with acute myocardial ischemia, it is suggested that transfusion for a Hb < 8 g/dL may be beneficial. Of note, given the lack of clinical trials focusing specifically on the effects on anemia in acute myocardial ischemia, this recommendation was considered level 3 evidence [11]. Recent studies focusing specifically on the issue of transfusion in cardiac disease have taken place with conflicting results [30\u201332]. This is discussed in more detail below\u2014exceptional circumstances. However, the authors do highlight that RBC transfusion should not be considered as an absolute method to improve tissue oxygen delivery in the critically ill. With regard to sepsis and neurologic injury, the authors note that current data are insufficient to provide level 1 recommendations.",

Conversely, they also report the exception that in postoperative surgical patients, transfusion should be considered at Hb < 8 g/dL or less in the presence of symptoms such as chest pain, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, or congestive heart failure. The latter recommendation was largely informed by the results of the FOCUS trial [31] in which the authors examined the role of a more liberal threshold-based transfusion practice (<10 g/dL) versus symptom-driven (transfusion permitted if symptomatic with Hb < 8 g/dL) transfusion in patients with known cardiovascular disease who were undergoing surgery. These authors found no benefit from liberal (Hb < 10 g/dL) versus restrictive (Hb < 8 g/dL or symptomatic) practice, however they refrained from making any specific recommendations regarding transfusion thresholds in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome.",

            "text": "Following publicationof the early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) guidelines by Rivers et al. [33], motivation to administer RBC transfusion increased. Specifically recommendations were to transfuse RBCs to maintain a hematocrit > 30 % or to achieve a central venous oxygen saturation > 70 %, in addition to fluid resuscitation, use of inotropic agents, respiratory support, and invasive cardiopulmonary monitoring [34]. While these international guidelines are broadly endorsed for the management of early sepsis, this study was not designed to specifically evaluate the risks and benefits of transfusion. Additionally, since RBC transfusion was just one of several interventions, the attributable benefit is unclear. Indeed, specific guidance on the administration of RBC transfusion has been removed from the most recent iteration of the surviving sepsis guidelines [35]. Moreover, data exist to suggest an immunomodulatory effect of RBC transfusion [36], which may potentially propagate sepsis. Indeed, a recent systematic review noted a significant reduction in healthcare-associated infections in patients receiving a restrictive transfusion strategy [37]. To this end a recently completed multicenter randomized trial\u2014Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) [38]\u2014compared patient outcome with EGDT-driven care protocols versus protocolized standard therapy which did not require transfusion versus standard care. These authors concluded that need for organ support, mortality at 90 days and 1 year were comparable between all three groups. The recently published Transfusion Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial failed to support the need for more liberal RBC transfusion practices in those presenting with septic shock [39]. In lieu of further clinical data, the recommendation that each patient be assessed individually based upon symptoms and clinical need remains paramount, over arbitrarily defining a numeric transfusion trigger.",

Unfortunately, evidence relating to the optimum transfusion practice in this subgroup of patients remains limited. As such, guidelines for RBC transfusion in this specific population remain somewhat imprecise, particularly in the setting of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The generally accepted threshold in clinical practice is to transfuse these patients if their hemoglobin falls below 8 g/dL [32]. To date, the strongest evidence specifically evaluating the role of transfusion in patients with cardiac disease comes from the FOCUS, TRACS, and MINT trials. In 2006, the FOCUS trial [31] found no benefit from liberal (Hb < 10 g/dL) versus restrictive (Hb < 8 g/dL or symptomatic) in terms of mortality, independent walking, or myocardial infarction. Similar notions were endorsed by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists in their 2011 guideline [27]. Although their threshold was set at 6\u20137 g/dL, they again emphasize that patients\u2019 clinical condition should be the most important component of the clinical decision to transfuse, and that these decisions will often be multifactorial.",

            "text": "Importantly, neither of these publications evaluated or commented on the safety of transfusion thresholds in patients experiencing ACS. Interestingly, patients enrolled in the TRICC study [40] were evaluated for cardiac events, including myocardial ischemia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. Evaluation of the entire cohort indicated that there was no evidence for an increase in adverse cardiac events in the restrictive group; however, subgroup analysis of patients with ischemic heart disease suggested a non-significant trend toward increased mortality at 30 and 60 days in the restrictive group [40]. This study was unfortunately underpowered to evaluate such an association, however these findings raised significant concern to warrant further investigation. In 2008, a single-center observational study published data relating to their experience of transfusion in ACS [32]. After careful adjustment for confounding variables, the authors concluded that transfusion appeared to be protective in the setting of a nadir Hb < 8 g/dL but harmful if nadir Hb was > 8 g/dL [32]. Following this observation, the TRACS study was established to evaluate the safety of restrictive perioperative RBC transfusion following elective cardiac surgery. These authors concluded that restrictive transfusion was noninferior when compared to liberal perioperative RBC transfusion [21]. In an effort to further clarify the optimal RBC transfusion threshold in the setting of ACS, Carson et al. conducted a pilot study (Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion\u2014MINT) addressing this very issue [30]. Though underpowered, the authors again noted a trend toward reduction in the composite outcome, death, myocardial infarction, or unplanned revascularization in patients transfused to a hemoglobin goal of >10 g/dL [30]. The findings of the MINT trial support both the feasibility and need for a large-scale randomized clinical trial in this area. In view of the ongoing clinical equipoise surrounding ACS, and in the absence of a randomized clinical trial, using a transfusion trigger of 8 g/dL would appear reasonable in these patients.",

This practice has changed considerably since a 2004 systematic review revealed no benefit from hemodilution [42]. Subsequently, Naidech and colleagues described an association between increased cerebral infarction and death in anemic patients with neurologic injury [43], promoting adoption of a more liberal transfusion practice aiming to keep Hb > 10 g/dL. The primary hypothesis underpinning this observation was that the adverse outcomes associated with anemia were secondary to impaired oxygen delivery to the brain. Indeed, this theory appeared to be supported by a number of prospective observational studies [44, 45] demonstrating that brain tissue oxygenation was markedly improved after RBC transfusion. However, these investigations have numerous notable limitations and perhaps more importantly, no effects on neurologic outcomes were observed. Therefore, the clinical implications of these findings remain a matter of debate.",

It has been postulated that a rapid decline in S-nitrosohemoglobin concentrations, with resultant reduction in red cell deformability, can result in microcirculatory occlusions and subsequent tissue ischemia [55]. Meanwhile, others have suggested an immunomodulating effect of RBCs may be causal [36]. Additional adverse biochemical effects associated with RBC storage include reductions in ATP and 2,3-DPG [56, 57]. While there is little debate regarding these and numerous other time-dependent changes in both the RBCs themselves as well as the storage supernatant, the clinical impact of these changes remains unclear. Although observational data clearly suggest an association between prolonged storage and adverse recipient outcomes [58], these findings have not born out in the available, albeit small clinical trials [59]. More importantly, several recent multicenter clinical trials have failed to confirm the clinical significance of the RBC storage lesion. Nonetheless, the absence of strong data suggesting efficacy, combined with the known risks associated with RBC transfusion (discussed in detail below) suggest that a restrictive RBC transfusion practice is prudent until further data become available.",

More contemporaneously, plasma has been used in a number of clinical settings, including treatment of active hemorrhage, as a replacement solution for specific populations receiving pharesis therapies, and for the prevention of bleeding in patients with abnormal coagulation parameters [61\u201363]. Frequently, however, plasma transfusions have been administered in the absence of evidence-based indications [64, 65].

As such, clinical decisions relating to plasma transfusion should carefully weigh the risk-to-benefit ratio. In 2011, the National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey reported that almost four million units of plasma were transfused in the United States alone [14]. While guidelines exist for the use of plasma in specific care scenarios, indications are limited and equipoise remains in many clinical contexts [28, 61, 62, 64]. Worryingly, despite a lack of evidence, approximately 30 % of transfusions are believed to be administered outside of published guidelines [66, 67]. Nationally, there are inconsistencies in plasma transfusion practice, with the most commonly cited rationale being efforts to correct abnormal pre-procedural international normalized ratios (INR) in non-bleeding patients [13]. This rationale is based on the assumption that an elevated INR correlates with increased bleeding, and that plasma transfusion will normalize the INR and prevent bleeding complications. Importantly, however, this indication is generally not supported by current evidence and is not endorsed as an indication for plasma transfusion by most society guidelines [61, 68]. When considering the available evidence suggesting a poor correlation between mild-to-moderate INR abnormalities and peri-procedural bleeding complications [69], attempts to correct INR through plasma transfusion appear to be ineffective and unnecessarily expose patients to the risks associated with plasma administration.",

In the absence of massive hemorrhage, current guidelines suggest a typical dose of plasma around 10\u201315 mL/kg predicted body weight [63]. This dose is expected to raise clotting factor levels by 25\u201330 % [62]. Thus the average 70 kg patient would require approximately 1 L of plasma to reverse coagulopathy, assuming ongoing factor losses had ceased. Recent efforts suggest that these dosing regimens may be inadequate, noting suboptimal correction of actual in vivo coagulation factor content [71]. In an investigation specifically addressing this issue, upwards of 30 mL/kg of plasma were needed to reliably increase coagulation factor content to desired levels [71]. The issue of under-dosing plasma replacement has come to the forefront in the setting of massive transfusion where far more liberal plasma transfusion practices (e.g. 1 unit of plasma for every unit of RBC administered) are now frequently endorsed.",

While there is some discrepancy in the literature regarding the optimal ratio of plasma to RBCs [76], a systematic review by Roback and colleagues in 2010 found that overall, use of a plasma:RBC ratio greater than 1:3 was associated with a reduction in mortality and multiorgan failure [64]. However, a concern with the majority of the observational studies that have suggested benefit with liberal plasma transfusion is the issue of survival bias [76, 77]. Moreover, a growing body of evidence has linked liberal plasma transfusion to adverse outcomes in those who do not ultimately experience massive hemorrhage [76\u201380]. In light of these concerns, we endorse the need for more definitive clinical trials to determine the optimal strategy for coagulation factor replacement in this setting. The recently published PROPPR trial noted improved hemostasis with more liberal plasma administration (1 unit of plasma for every unit of RBC), but the primary outcomes of mortality at 24 h and 90 days did not improve with these more liberal approaches to plasma administration).",

Indeed, a number of reports have concluded that modest abnormalities in coagulation tests, such as INR, do not correlate well with surgical blood loss or the need for subsequent RBC transfusions [81, 82]. Furthermore, the impact of plasma transfusion on outcomes is uncertain in the absence of bleeding. In part, these findings can be explained by the nonlinear relationship between INR and plasma coagulation factor levels [13, 83]. Since thrombus formation is directly proportionate to in vivo coagulation factor concentrations and not the INR, it is unsurprising that bleeding and hemostasis are therefore not well correlated with the latter. Indeed, though plasma transfusion will often correct a markedly elevated INR, the associated change in actual coagulation factor concentrations is frequently insufficient for adequate hemostasis [84]. In contrast, evidence suggests that it is often not possible to correct more modest elevations in the INR (e.g. INR 1.1\u20131.85), since the INR for a unit of plasma itself often falls above the normal range [66, 69].",

Therefore, at an INR level of \u22641.6\u2014corresponding to a factor level of at least 30 % in most patients [82, 85]\u2014it is unlikely that transfusion of additional plasma will significantly alter a patient\u2019s ability to form thrombus. An important exception to this relates to patients with liver disease. In this setting, it has previously been demonstrated that INR values do not represent the same degree of clotting factor deficiency as is seen with patients on Warfarin for any given INR. In fact, patients with liver disease will typically have lower levels of factor VII [86]. In addition, these patients are also typically deficient in the anticoagulant protein \u201cProtein C\u201d [74], therefore INR values and associated bleeding risk must be interpreted with caution in this context. Of note, a landmark study by Spector and colleagues demonstrated that transfusion of additional plasma in attempt to correct these patients\u2019 INRs typically only resulted in a temporary correction [87].

In addition, factors such as bone marrow suppression, liver disease, medication side-effects, bleeding, and consumptive disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are frequently encountered in these populations [5]. Although platelet transfusion itself is not without risk, previous observational studies have demonstrated thrombocytopenia to be associated with major bleeding events, increased hospital and ICU lengths of stay, and mortality [94]. Unfortunately, few randomized trials have investigated platelet transfusion thresholds and their association with patient-important outcomes. At present, prophylactic platelet transfusions for specific platelet count thresholds (e.g. <10 \u00d7 109/L) in critically ill patients continue to be supported in the literature [95\u201397]. However, the literature also suggests that platelets continue to be given outside of these recommendations [98]. In 2007, Cameron and colleagues noted that non-cardiac surgical patients at their institution were typically transfused platelets outside of existing guidelines, with a mean platelet count of 85 \u00d7 109/L [99]. Perhaps more concerning is the increased awareness of the risks associated with platelet transfusion in the critically ill [5, 100].",

Prior to undergoing invasive procedures, platelet transfusion may also be considered for patients with a platelet count < 50 \u00d7 109/L (<100 \u00d7 109/L in neurosurgical/ophthalmologic procedures) [104]. Evidence suggests that bleeding due to thrombocytopenia is minimal above this threshold, provided platelets are functional [105]. In the situation whereby platelet count is normal but suspicion for platelet dysfunction exists (e.g. antiplatelet therapies or congenital disorders), platelet transfusion may also be appropriate when significant bleeding is present. An anticipated platelet response in a 70 kg adult would be an increase of 5\u201310 \u00d7 109/L per unit transfused, thus guiding appropriate dosing [106].",

Serial transfusions may produce a state of platelet refractoriness, however this is most commonly seen in patients with hematologic malignancies [106, 107]. With regard to achieving the desired end effect of hemostasis or hemorrhage prevention, the majority of evidence to date focuses on platelet transfusion in the setting of hematologic malignancies. In these patients, prophylactic platelet transfusion has been shown to be beneficial at a threshold of < 10 \u00d7 109/L [107] with reduced rates of non-fatal severe hemorrhage [95, 96]. However, the generalizability of these findings to the surgical ICU patient population remains unclear. Indeed, there is remarkably scant data to guide platelet administration in this setting. Nonetheless, in the absence of massive hemorrhage, it is generally accepted that transfusing platelets when counts are >50 \u00d7 109/L is not supported by current evidence. The exception to this is in the setting of massive transfusion, when application of the 1:1:1 ratio of RBCs, plasma, and platelets has been purported primarily following investigations in military populations which have noted improved survival [108\u2013110].

While some inconsistencies exist [113, 114], a large number of early human and animal studies demonstrated multiple benefits including decreased hemorrhage and increased survival [115, 116]. More recently, Idris and colleagues have demonstrated that cryoprecipitate transfusion results in the expected rise in serum fibrinogen levels, with this benefit appearing to be more pronounced in patients with acute versus chronic deficiencies [117]. Although this study did not directly evaluate the impact of cryoprecipitate transfusion on bleeding events, Lee and colleagues went on to study the impact on fibrin-based clot formation in cardiac surgical patients [118]. This study demonstrated cryoprecipitate transfusion both increased serum fibrinogen and the quality of fibrin-based clot formation assessed using thromboelastometry. In the same year, a large multicenter prospective observational study evaluated cryoprecipitate use in trauma patients [119]. These authors concluded that transfusion practice was highly variable between institutions, but that cryoprecipitate transfusion was not associated with in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, cryoprecipitate was recently demonstrated to independently add to survival benefit in war casualties with hemorrhagic shock [120]. Despite this stepwise generation of promising data relating to cryoprecipitate use in recent years, recent literature puts a greater focus on the role of fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates in these scenarios [121\u2013123]. This evolving topic is discussed in greater detail below under the heading massive transfusion. Importantly, randomized trials are necessary to better determine the clinical efficacy and optimal dose for cryoprecipitate transfusion.",

In 2004, content experts from around the world convened and proposed what are now the most widely accepted criteria for TRALI [126]. Thesecriteria define TRALI as the new onset of acute lung injury (ALI) within 6 h of blood product transfusion in the absence of additional, temporally related ALI risk factors (Table 35.1) [126]. In the presence of alternate ALI risk factors, patients are classified as having \u201cpossible TRALI.\u201d TRALI\u2019s true incidence has been a matter of debate over recent years with estimates ranging from less than 1 % in the broad population of all hospitalized patients, up to 8.2 % in certain high-risk surgical populations and the critically ill [125, 127\u2013131]. In truth, the incidence of \u201cclean\u201d TRALI cases (no additional risk factors for ALI) is likely at the lower end of this spectrum, while the composite of TRALI/possible TRALI is likely best represented by the upper ranges. Regardless, a growing body of evidence suggests we frequently underestimate the rate of TRALI due to a number of flaws in case identification and reporting [132\u2013135]. Notably, TRALI is consistently noted to be the leading cause of transfusion-related death reported to the FDA [12].\n",

Despite this observation, red blood cells account for the largest number of TRALI cases due to the greater overall number of RBC units transfused. Of note, recent changes in the procurement of transfusable plasma components (e.g. male-only donor policies, HLA antibody testing) have greatly reduced the rate of plasma-associated TRALI [139\u2013143].

Thereafter, the passive delivery of donor antibodies in the blood component interact with cognate recipient leukocyte antigens\u2014the \u201csecond hit\u201d\u2014activating sensitized recipient neutrophils, producing an inflammatory reaction within the lung, and leading to inflammatory lung edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome). As multiparous female donors are at risk of developing anti-leukocyte antibodies [145]; numerous countries (including the US) have removed these individuals from the transfusable plasma donor pool. As noted above, these practices have been associated with significant reductions in the rate of plasma-associated TRALI. Of note, a significant number of TRALI cases have occurred in the absence of detectable donor antibody or cognate recipient antigen [146, 147]. Such cases have led to the proposition of an alternative \u201csecond hit\u201d that is thought most likely to be the result of infusing alternate soluble biologic modifiers (e.g. neutral lipids, cell-free hemoglobin) that are also capable of activating sensitized neutrophils. For more detailed discussion on TRALI mechanisms, we note a number of excellent recent reviews [148\u2013150]. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective therapies for the treatment of TRALI and therefore management remains primarily supportive with oxygen supplementation and ventilator support when needed [151]. As with lung injury that occurs in the setting of alternative major risk factors for ARDS, low-tidal volume ventilation is recommended for patients with TRALI who require invasive ventilatory support.",

While unproven, this association may relate to the large volume of plasma that is often transfused when attempting to reverse the effects of anticoagulant therapies. Mechanistically, TACO is believed primarily the result of fluid overload with resultant hydrostatic pulmonary edema [159]. Supporting data include identified associations between volume of blood product transfused, rate of transfusion, overall volume status, and the presence of cardiovascular or renal disease [155, 160\u2013162]. Additional reported risk factors include extremes of age, severe chronic anemia, and transfusion in a setting of hemorrhagic shock [155, 161\u2013163]. Notably, a number of studies have identified cases of TACO occurring after low-volume or even single unit transfusion [164]. This, in concert with the typical hypertensive response associated with TACO [165], has led to the proposition of additional alternate mechanisms of TACO, including microcirculatory nitric oxide trapping [166] as well as leukocyte and platelet-derived inflammatory mediators [167].",

In light of the frequent co-existence of cardiovascular disease, non-invasive ventilatory strategies should be considered early in the course of syndrome onset with the hopes of avoiding the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Should the hemodynamic status allow, diuretic therapy can be considered with the hopes of mitigating excess intravascular volume and attenuating the patient\u2019s pulmonary edema [159].

The resulting administration of an ABO incompatible RBC unit results in the strong binding of complement, intravascular hemolysis and activation of the coagulation cascade [168, 169]. Collectively this results in disseminated intravascular coagulation, bleeding, hypotension, and organ failure. Fortunately, improvements in the systems and processes within our hospitals as well as the policies surrounding blood product administration have significantly reduced the frequency of AHTRs. However, when they do occur, consequences for patients can be devastating with 16 % of transfusion-related fatalities reported to the FDA in 2013 being attributed to AHTRs [12]. Adverse reactions can be seen with non-ABO donor RBC antigens as well. Often, these interactions result in delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. The presence of anti-Kidd antibodies in the transfusion recipient provides an example. Similar reactions have also been noted with the Kell, Duffy, and Rh RBC antigen families [168, 170]. Although AHTR are most frequently observed with RBC transfusion, similar reactions can be seen with out-of-group platelet transfusion if the transfusate contains a sufficient amount of incompatible plasma.",

The clinical presentation is that of a rise in temperature exceeding 1 \u00b0C in the absence of hemolysis and other more likely causes of fever. Febrile reactions typically present within 4 h of transfusion and manifestations are generally mild in nature. Occasionally, patients may experience more marked symptoms with rigors and chills. Indeed this may be the only presenting complaint in a patient treated with pre-transfusion antipyretics, although evidence for this intervention remains a matter of debate [173]. Febrile reactions can be seen with any WBC-containing blood product, but are most commonly observed with RBC and platelet transfusions. The etiology of febrile transfusion reactions is believed related to cytokines released from WBCs during apoptosis. Notably, the introduction of leukoreduction strategies has led to a significant reduction in the frequency of febrile reactions [172, 174]. The cornerstones of managing a febrile transfusion reaction include discontinuation of the transfusion episode and administration of antipyretics.",

Indeed, prior to the routine use of immunosuppressant medications, this side effect of transfusion was used to the advantage of patients undergoing solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [175, 176]. While the specific mechanisms underlying this potential effect remain incompletely defined, available literature supports a variety of transfusion-related immunomodulatory effects including suppression of cytotoxic cell and monocyte activity, release of immunosuppressive prostaglandins, inhibition of interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, and increased suppressor T-cell activity [177]. Concerning for surgical and critically ill patients, multiple lines of evidence have associated transfusion episodes with increased risk of nosocomial infections [8, 37]. Furthermore, others have expressed concern relating to cancer recurrence [177]. Notably, the introduction of universal leukoreduction for RBC units appears to have attenuated, although not completely eliminated, the association between RBC transfusion and numerous adverse outcomes including infectious complications [178]. Ongoing research efforts will continue to refine our understanding of the mechanisms and clinical impact of TRIM.",

TIC appears to occur when thrombin generation resulting from tissue injury co-occurs with shock. This combination leads to activation of the protein C system with a resultant hypocoaguable state, thus contributing to persistent bleeding [192\u2013194]. Additionally, dilution of both coagulation factor content and platelets resulting from large-volume resuscitation that is devoid of these blood constituents is believed to play a role in the development and propagation of TIC as well.",

            "text": "Cognizant of the frequent occurrence of TIC as well as its association with adverse patient outcomes, enthusiasm for more aggressive and early plasma and platelet transfusion has increased dramatically [108, 109, 195]. Due to the historic absence of rapid and reliable clinical tests that might guide specific platelet and coagulation factor replacement strategies, identification of optimal ratios of RBCs to plasma and platelets has been the focus of investigation. To this end, early military data first purported the use of a 1:1:1 ratio (RBC:plasma:platelet transfusion) theorizing that its composition more closely resembled whole blood and may prevent the occurrence of TIC [110]. Multiple subsequent studies, primarily in military populations, have noted improved survival with these massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) [108, 109, 196]. Importantly, however, concerns related to issues such as survival bias [76, 77, 197, 198], increased rates of adverse outcomes in those who do not ultimately require massive transfusion [199\u2013201], as well as the unclear generalizability of such findings to civilian trauma populations as well as non-trauma massive hemorrhage scenarios attenuate enthusiasm for the broad implementation of these MTPs without further study. Of note, the prospective randomized optimal platelet and plasma ratio (PROPPR) trial is currently underway to further evaluate the optimal ratio to be used in civilian hospitals.",

            "text": "More recently, emerging data have highlighted the importance of fibrinogen replacement in massive bleeding [122]. This follows the observation that hypofibrinogenemia was independently associated with the occurrence and severity of hemorrhage in several surgical populations including obstetric [202] and cardiac surgical patients [203]. Subsequently, a number of case reports and randomized trials have corroborated these results in various surgical populations. Specifically, fibrinogen transfusion was noted to produce rapid correction of laboratory parameters of coagulation [204], cessation of hemorrhage [204], improved clot firmness [205], and reduced perioperative allogeneic transfusion requirements [123, 206] when compared to standard care. Moreover, these studies suggest fibrinogen concentrates have a good safety profile. Indeed, no thromboembolic events were directly attributed to the use of fibrinogen, and these products likely offer a reduced incidence of viral and prion transmission when compared to cryoprecipitate [207].",

Aside from the relative speed of these tests when compared to traditional laboratory measurements, proposed advantages include the fact that whole blood is tested as opposed to centrifuged blood with whole cells removed. Importantly this ensures that the overall assessment of coagulation accounts for clotting factors, platelets, erythrocytes, and other tissue factor bearing cells. It is felt that this may provide a more accurate in vitro assessment of the in vivo coagulation environment [91]. Emerging literature has described successful TEG/ROTEM-targeted administration of PCCs and fibrinogen in bleeding surgical critically ill patients [89, 90, 208]. Indeed, these tests may support optimal coagulation factor resuscitation by providing a more accurate assessment of specific coagulation defect(s) present, and by avoiding delays associated with traditional laboratory testing such as prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. However, although promising, additional studies are still needed to better understand the value and impact of their use in heterogeneous clinical contexts.",

It should be noted that time to onset will be delayed several hours after administration and will vary depending upon the route of delivery.

A number of studies have compared FFP and PCCs at a dose of 25\u201350 IU/kg and found that PCCs produce a more rapid and complete correction of the INR [219\u2013221]. To date, a single prospective randomized controlled trial has been undertaken to evaluate PCCs comparative safety and efficacy [222]. In this study, Sarode et al. report non-inferiority of four-factor PCCs compared to FFP for the urgent reversal of vitamin K antagonists in non-surgical patients [222]. Additional favorable features of PCCs include the low volume infusion required to adequately replace coagulation factor content, thereby avoiding the risk of volume overload often encountered with FFP [222]. PCCs are also typically more readily available as their storage at room temperature negates the need for thawing and warming and they can be safely infused at a faster rate [223].",

            "text": "Similarly, numerous investigators have begun exploring alternate potential applications for recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). Originally developed for the treatment of serious bleeding in hemophilia, rVIIa is commercially available as a lyophilized powder that is stored at 2\u201325 \u00b0C and reconstituted at the time of use with l-histidine in water to achieve an end volume of 7 mL [227]. Novel applications have been in the setting of bleeding in major surgery [228\u2013230] and trauma [231] as well as liver disease [232], obstetric [233], and intracranial [234] hemorrhage. While these observational studies and single-center clinical trials were encouraging, subsequent multicenter clinical trials have failed to reproduce analogous results in all clinical scenarios. Although Gill and colleagues reported a reduced incidence of reoperation for bleeding and RBC transfusion in patients treated with rFVIIa following cardiac surgery [235], Boffard et al. noted that it was only efficacious in the setting of blunt versus penetrating trauma [236]. Similarly, other investigators have described a lack of efficacy in variceal bleeding [237], hepatectomy [238], intracranial hemorrhage [239], and congenital cardiac surgery [240]. In the setting of anticoagulant reversal, results have been equally inconsistent. Importantly, despite the correction in laboratory coagulation parameters seen with rFVIIa, its ability to achieve hemostasis does not necessarily appear to correlate [241, 242]. Perhaps more concerning is their questionable safety profile. Indeed a recent large systematic review concluded that rFVIIa was associated with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic disease, particularly ACS [243]. Meanwhile others have noted an increase in venous thromboembolic disease [244], and in cardiac surgical patients, incidence of stroke appeared to be increased [245].",

Most recently the CRASH-2 trial found that early tranexamic acid administration in trauma patients resulted in both reduced all-cause mortality and reduced mortality due to bleeding, although transfusion requirements were similar in the treatment and placebo groups. Importantly, these investigators did not find any increase in vascular occlusive events in the treatment arm. Furthermore, a number of additional surgical populations have replicated similar results including orthopedics, cardiovascular, liver transplantation, urologic, gynecologic, and obstetric surgery [249]. However, persistent concern over the potential for exaggerated thrombosis has precluded more robust adoption of these strategies. Clearly, this is an area where additional research is needed. Additional specific factor concentrates (e.g. vWF, Factor IX, VIII) and alternative therapeutics (e.g. Desmopressin/Estrogen) also have roles in specific clinical conditions.
