Their biology, physiology, and anatomy are unlike those of any other reptiles. However, some species have suffered the effects of a changing environment and human encroachment; this situation has led to the formation of international programs dedicated to the preservation of threatened or near-extinct species. Of the 23 species of crocodilians, 13 can be found on the red list of endangered species.1 Taxonomic identification varies among all species, and there is debate over the proper classification of species and subspecies (TABLE 6-1, TABLE 6-2\n; Box 6-1\n). In addition to having wild crocodilian populations, countries such as Australia, India, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, and the United States maintain intensive production operations for various species.BOX 6-1Taxonomy of the Family Gavialidae\n\n",

In farming operations, breeding pairs of alligators were kept in enclosed areas where they could mate and nest (Figure 6-1\n). The eggs were collected from the nests and incubated. The farming operations led to ranching operations in which eggs are harvested from the wild and incubated in private facilities (Figure 6-2\n). The alligators hatched on an \u201calligator ranch\u201d are then raised for their hide and meat. To help maintain the wild populations, 14% of the hatched alligators are eventually returned to the wild. Louisiana is the primary producer of American alligators in the world. Captive rearing operations can also be found in Florida, Texas, Georgia, and other southern states within the United States where alligators naturally inhabit. In Louisiana the majority of the operations are ranches, whereas many farms still exist in Florida. Other crocodilian species, such as the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), are primarily raised under farming operations in other countries.",

Zoologic parks house different species of crocodilians for educational purposes, reproductive efforts, or both. As is the case with many other threatened species, zoologic institutions play a critical role in the captive reproduction of threatened species of crocodilians. Here the animals can be observed by specialists in a more controlled environment that mimics their natural habitat, although design and maintenance of the enclosures can be difficult.

There are many reasons why crocodilian species should not be maintained as pets. In addition to the physical dangers and risks associated with keeping crocodilians, there is the misfortune of inadequate husbandry, adversely affecting the reptile's health. Most crocodilians grow to be larger than other reptile species and therefore have significant space requirements. Like most animals requiring an aquatic environment, crocodilians need water that is clean and free of disease. Another husbandry issue is an incorrect diet, which can lead to metabolic abnormalities and overall poor health. Many private owners are unable or unwilling to provide these conditions for their crocodilians. In addition to these issues, most states will require special permits to own theseanimals. Most people lack the proper ownership permits, and veterinarians could be liable if they treat these illegal patients. The biggest challenge that veterinarians face when treating illegally owned animals is that they are often the last chance for humane treatment for these animals. It is the duty of veterinarians to educate these clients and persuade them to place these animals in appropriate zoologic institutions or other accredited facilities.",

The natural environment and geographic distribution of a species will often determine disease exposure. Once in captivity, all species are susceptible to the same diseases within that environment.

            "text": "One of the most common questions a veterinarian may encounter regarding reptiles is \u201cWhat is the difference between alligators and crocodiles?\u201d The first difference is that they belong to two different families: the family Alligatoridae (see Table 6-1) includes the alligators and caimans, and the family Crocodylidae (see Table 6-2) includes all crocodiles. There is a third family, the Gavialidae (see Box 6-1), which contains the gharial, or gavial. Geographic location may help in the identification of some species. Alligators are thought to tolerate colder temperatures and live at higher latitudes, whereas crocodiles and caimans are less cold resistant and live in warmer areas.2 However, there are some anatomic features that will be most useful in differentiating alligators from crocodiles. The alligators and caimans have a broad, u-shaped snout, whereas crocodiles have a more narrow, v-shaped snout. This difference can be observed by looking at the dorsal aspect of the head (Figure 6-3\n). A more obvious distinction can be made when looking at their mouth from the side (Figure 6-4\n). Alligatorsand caimans have notches in the maxilla that fit the mandibular teeth. Therefore, they have no mandibular teeth visible if observed from the side with their mouth closed. On the other hand, crocodiles have the fourth mandibular tooth exposed when looking at them from the side with their mouth closed. Integumentary sensing organs, also known as dome pressure receptors (DPRs), are clear to gray pits present on the skin of crocodilians. Their function is not completely understood, but they may play a role as mechanoreceptors in prey detection or even as chemoreceptors aiding in detection of salinity levels.3, 4 Alligators and caimans have DPRs only on the lateral aspect of the mandible (Figure 6-5\n), whereas crocodiles and gharials have DPRs all over the body, most noticeably on the ventral scales (Figure 6-6\n). The presence of DPRs can be used to differentiate the two main groups of crocodilian skins in the leather market. An additional feature that could be used for differentiation of alligators and crocodiles is the salt glands, which are absent from the tongue of alligators and caimans but well developed in crocodiles and gharials.",

There is some discrepancy as to the name of this structure and its two components, but I will attempt to describe them based on the anatomic location. Crocodilians have a true hard palate in the roof of the mouth that ends caudally in a soft palate. This soft palate has a ventral flap that is referred to as the velum palati. The velum palati is the dorsal component of the palatal valve, with its second and ventral component being the gular fold. This structure projects in a craniodorsal direction from the base of the tongue and has a cartilaginous base to it that is part of the larynx. Together, the velum palati and the gular fold form what is known as the palatal, or gular, valve (Figure 6-7\n). The function of this valve is to seal the pharyngeal cavity while under water to prevent aspiration. Crocodilians also have control of the nares and are able to open and close them as needed to prevent aspiration of water.",

The circulation of blood through the crocodilian heart is like that in the heart of mammals, but the crocodilians possess a viable foramen of Panizza. This opening is located at the base of the heart between the left and right aortic arches and allows for venous admixture, which is essential during periods of diving to conserve oxygen.5 During diving, there is pulmonary hypertension. This in turn creates increased pressure in the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle, which forces deoxygenated blood through the foramen of Panizza into the left side of the heart and the aorta to be distributed through the body. This mechanism allows for conservation of oxygen and supplies oxygenated blood to those organs that require it the most, allowing some crocodilian species to stay submerged for up to 6 hours.6 A second anastomosis may be present in other crocodilian species as a vessel connecting the two aortic arches.2\n",

Outdoor exhibits can closely mimic the natural environment but also present more challenges for maintaining water and environmental quality as well as for controlling diseases. Geographic location will also play a role in the creation of outdoor exhibits, as not all species of crocodilians can tolerate cold weather. Finally, some species can dig considerably, and measures must be taken to prevent an escape.",

Once again, an understanding of crocodilian biology and natural history is needed to try and duplicate their natural environment. An important consideration is the allowance of circadian variations in light cycle and temperatures to mimic their natural environment. This is not the case in many commercial operations, where they are maintained at a fairly constant temperature and humidity to achieve faster growth. From a health standpoint, this may allow for cross exposure of reptiles in commercial operations to infectious organisms that typically affect mammals. As the commercial reptiles are maintained at higher temperatures, new diseases commonly associated with mammals may adapt to living inside a reptile host and lead to clinical disease. In an enclosure, the temperature can be maintained via heating elements contained within the concrete slab, in line water heaters, or both. The water temperature must also be maintained during the refilling of the pen or enclosure to avoid significant temperature variations.",

            "text": "Light requirements for reptiles are still a controversial subject. In general, a source of ultraviolet B (UVB) light for herbivorous and omnivorous reptiles is recommended. Ultraviolet light is essential for the synthesis of vitamin D3, specifically its active form 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D, which is essential for the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus. A lack of vitamin D3 can lead to inappropriate calcium absorption, which in turn creates a metabolic imbalance resulting in metabolic bone disease. Metabolic bone disease, specifically secondary nutritional hyperparathyroidism, is recognized in many reptile species housed with an inappropriate source of UVB light, fed a diet deficient in calcium, or both. Carnivorous reptiles may also benefit from UVB light but are thought to obtain enough vitamin D3 and calcium from their prey. The UVB light requirement of crocodilians is unknown, but as true carnivores they may thrive with minimal exposure to UVB light. It is a common practice on alligator ranches to raise animals in darkness with no source of UVB light or a normal light cycle. Most animals will grow well under these conditions, and some have reached adulthood without signs of metabolic diseases. However, I have also observed evidence of metabolic bone disease in a subset of captive American alligators being fed a commercial diet with no exposure to UVB light. In these cases veterinarians must also consider the possibility that the commercial diet may be deficient in calcium. Anecdotal stories from alligator ranches claim that weak, anorectic animals appear to improve after being exposed to sunlight over a period of time. Further research is needed to determine the UVB light requirements of crocodilians and the potential benefits of exposure to UVB light. Natural unfiltered sunlight is the best source of UVB light, but various artificial sources are available (e.g., fluorescent UVB light bulbs, mercury vapor light bulbs).",

As they grow, they will eat larger prey of the type described earlier and will incorporate fish and birds into their dietary regime. With time, and depending on the species, size, and food availability, crocodilians will start eating mammals. There have been few studies investigating the nutritional requirements and feeding protocols of alligators.8, 9, 10 Various commercial feeds are available for alligators maintained in captivity. The commercial rations consist of dry pelleted diets that try to provide full nutritional requirements. These diets can be found with a 45%, 47%, or 56% protein content, less than 11% fat, and approximately 3% fiber content.11 Refined commercial alligator diets are widely used in production operations but may prove too expensive and/or inappropriate for the long term. A variety of whole prey feeds, such as chicken, nutria, and fish, are also recommended. If using nutria, be sure that it has not been killed using lead shot; if the lead is ingested, toxicosis can occur.12 When feeding frozen fish to crocodilians, provide a vitamin B supplement or another meat source to prevent thiamine deficiency. To prevent dietary associated problems, purchase meat from a reputable source.",

The oral examination can be performed if a speculum (e.g., PVC pipe, piece of wood) is inserted in the mouth before securing it with tape or a rope (Figure 6-9, Figure 6-10\n). Examine the eyes for evidence of discharge and assess their function (Figure 6-11\n).

The autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic adrenal axis, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, and neuroimmunologic mediators all have a role in the response of the immune system to stress.16 Measuring stress and immunosuppression is a challenge in veterinary medicine. There are no specific tests available to provide a clinical measure of stress. Veterinarians concentrate on identifying a combination of physiologic changes that give them an idea of what is involved in a stress response. The stress response in crocodilians has been examined in relation to restraint, long-term corticosterone implants, cold shock, and stocking densities.15, 17, 18, 19, 20 Lance et al. provides an overview of the physiology and endocrinology of stress in crocodilians.21 Catecholamines, glucocorticoids, glucose, and lactate have been implicated in the stress response of crocodilians.

This facility had animals with a history of chronic dermatitis. The alligators with the most severe lesions were consistently located on one end of the building, whereas those at the other end were unaffected or only mildly affected. The location of the severely affected animals was consistent in all buildings. One building had no affected animals. Based on a thorough history and observation of the operation, a possible explanation was determined for the occurrence of the dermatitis problem. All of the buildings with affected animals had PVC pipes on the inside walls that delivered water to each individual pen. A strong water stream fell from the pipes down into the water and the strength of the stream decreased from one end of the building (inflow) to the other end (outflow). The strength of the water stream was considerable near the inflow. The building with no affected animals did not have any source of falling water into the pens. Water quality, temperature, and feed were the same in affected and nonaffected buildings. The most affected animals happened to be in the pens at the inflow side of the building with the number of affected animals decreasing toward the outflow side of the building. This constant flow of water was creating a constant movement of the water surface and consequently stimulating the alligators via the DPRs. Once this watering system was changed, the cases of dermatitis decreased and no new cases were reported. Although other factors, such as water quality, may have contributed to the dermatitis, the change in the watering system decreased the progression and occurrence of the disease. This case demonstrates the importance of addressing the environment, as well as the animals, when working in commercial operations.",

Resolution of clinical signs has been observed with and without changes in husbandry practices.63, 64 In crocodiles the lesions are described as 2 to 8 mm in diameter, yellow to brown, wart-like, sometimes firm, and unraised to raised nodules with occasional shallow ulcers. In crocodiles pox lesions appear on the head, palpebra, nostrils, sides of the mouth, oral cavity, limbs, ventral neck and coelom, and at the base of the tail.65, 66 Resolution of lesions was reported to occur as early as 3 to 4 weeks from the onset of clinical signs.65 Histopathologic findings include epithelial hyperplasia, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and necrosis, with intracytoplasmic Borrel and Bollinger's bodies being visible in some cases.62, 63, 64, 65, 66 Secondary bacterial and fungal infections may occur concurrently with the viral infection. At this time there are no specific treatment recommendations. The use of an autogenous vaccine to treat poxvirus in Nile crocodiles (C. niloticus) has had some success.65 Mosquito control and good hygiene are essential in preventing and controlling poxvirus outbreaks.",

There is also the possibility of infection after ingestion of an animal with a high viral load of WNV, as reported by Klenk et al.71 This last scenario is more likely to occur when crocodilians are housed outdoors and not in enclosed buildings, as in most ranching operations. It has been demonstrated that alligators can serve as amplifiers of WNV.71 Although there is a lot to be learned about WNV in crocodilians, it is believed that once infected, they can develop high viremias and shed the virus in the feces. Fecal shedding leads to horizontal transmission of the virus. There is clinical evidence for horizontal transmission to occur in commercial operations. Fecal shedding and high viremias also raise the concern of zoonosis, especially in commercial operations where animals are being slaughtered and people come in contact with blood and tissues. A strict building quarantine and hygiene strategies should be implemented to prevent the spread of WNV to other animals in the facility as well as to the personnel. In the state of Louisiana there are a number of recommendations provided to help alligator producers cope with episodes of WNV and prevent spread of the disease (Box 6-2\n).BOX 6-2Recommendations Made to Alligator Producers in Louisiana on How to Prevent and Manage West Nile Virus\n1.Buildings with affected animals should be maintained under isolation from other buildings in the farm.2.Feeding and cleaning of affected buildings should be performed last, after all other nonaffected buildings.3.A foot bath (1 part water, 1 part bleach) should be placed at the entrance of the building to disinfect the shoes and boots of farm employees before and after entering the building. This foot bath should be changed on a daily basis. In addition, a set of shoes or boots may be kept only to be used inside affected buildings.4.Hands should be washed before and after entering the building.5.The water should be changed more frequently in affected buildings, at least once a day. This may create additional stress on the animals but should decrease the amount of feces and therefore viral organisms possibly present in the water. Any special treatment of the discharge water still remains to be determined.6.Affected animals should not be transported to other alligator farms for processing of hides or meat.7.Additional care should be exercised during the slaughter process to avoid direct contact with the blood and organs of animals known as exposed to, or affected with, West Nile virus.8.Dead animals should be disposed of by burning the carcasses.9.Aggressive mosquito control is required to help in the prevention of the disease.\n",

Once WNV is present within an operation, it is critical to maintain infected and exposed animals in strict isolation. The ill and exposed animals must not be moved to other areas or buildings where WNVhas not been observed. Failure to maintain strict isolation may result in the spread of the virus throughout the facility. In addition, there should be strict biosecurity measures, especially in the affected areas or buildings. Tools such as nets, feeding utensils, boots, and so forth, must be left in the affected area and not introduced to other, \u201cclean\u201d areas or buildings. The surviving animals will continue to thrive after the WNV infection has run its course, but it is unknown for how long thereafter they can shed the virus. Antibody titers of 1 : 640 and 1 : 320 were observed in two alligators 14 months after exposure to WNV. These antibody titer results were obtained via a plaque reduction neutralization test. Definitive diagnosis of WNV infection should be based on history, clinical signs, and the results of diagnostic tests. Postmortem diagnosis can be performed via RT-PCR and/or viral culture of brain, spinal cord, or liver, with immunohistochemistry providing additional supportive evidence of WNV infection.

Poor water quality, trauma, stress, and extreme temperatures can contribute to the occurrence of fungal disease. It is thought that most fungal infections in crocodilians are of enteric origin and occur in other tissues secondary to an immuno-compromised state.2 It is important to remember that fungi are considered ubiquitous organisms in nature. Therefore, it is not uncommon to isolate fungi from tissues (e.g., skin, intestines) that are in contact with water and soil. The presence of fungi will vary with geographic location and management techniques that affect the different environments for their growth. There are a number of fungi that have been isolated from crocodilians2, 40, 51, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80 (Table 6-4\n). Some of these fungal organisms were associated with disease, whereas others were incidental findings. Diagnosis of fungal disease requires the identification of a fungal organism via culture or special stains of infected tissues. Positive identification of genus and species may be difficult. Treatment is expensive and may be affordable only when administering to a small number of animals. It also requires a long treatment period of at least 2 or 3 months. For these reasons, many fungal infections go untreated, and recommendations are made for prevention of disease.",

Internal parasites are not a common problem in ranching operations where animals are maintained in concrete buildings with no organic substrate. Parasites are of major concern in wild crocodilians or those kept captive outdoors on organic substrates. External parasites are more ubiquitous, affecting both captive and wild populations.

These commercial diets are available for feeding American alligators (A. mississippiensis), and although the diets are not perfect, if fed appropriately, captive-hatched American alligators (A. mississippiensis) will grow up to 36 inches in length within a 12-month period. For zoologic institutions the goal is not rapid growth but rather normal development and a foundation for excellent health. Zoologic institutions and crocodile farms commonly provide crocodilians with fresh and/or frozen prey (e.g., poultry, swine, beef, fish, nutria, native prey, etc.) with bones providing a source of calcium. To prevent lead toxicity in crocodilians, veterinarians must use a reputable fresh or frozen prey source that has not been killed with lead projectiles (e.g., shotgun pellets, bullets).

Clinical signs of MBD include weakness, lethargy, kyphosis, scoliosis, osteodystrophy, pathologic fractures, paresis, and tooth decalcification. Various possible causes of MBD have been proposed, but it is usually associated with a calcium-phosphorus imbalance that leads to increased bone resorption. Calcium and vitamin D3 are the two main nutritional compounds deficient in reptiles with MBD. Vitamin D3 deficiencies are associated with a lack of exposure to UVB spectrum light, which comes naturally from the sun. Light bulbs and light tubes are commercially available to help provide adequate amounts of UVB light for reptiles. MBD is primarily observed in herbivorous or omnivorous reptiles. It appears that MBD is not commonly observed in commercial crocodilian operations, even in those were animals are raised in the dark with no source of UVB light. The carnivorous nature of crocodilians may allow them to obtain vitamin D3 from the diet without a true requirement for UVB light. However, if an appropriate calcium source is not offered, these animals will develop MBD. Adult alligators without MBD have been observed growing in enclosed buildings with no light source while being fed a commercial diet supplemented with fresh prey meat with bones. However, anecdotal comments from various ranchers indicate that the animals appear to thrive better if exposed to sunlight. This is an area where more research is needed to determine the UVB and calcium requirements of crocodilians and their effects on growth and health.",

Water quality, temperature, and stressors contribute to the occurrence of integumentary diseases. Secondary bacterial and fungal dermatitis in crocodilians can have a devastating economic impact on commercial operations. Lacerations, abscesses, and draining tracts can serve as a nidus for microorganisms. An additional predisposing factor of integumentary disease in captive operations is the accumulation of fat in the upper water column. This concentration of fat creates a slime layer on the walls and water surface, which is then transferred to the skin of the animals where it creates an ideal environment for fungal and bacterial growth. This is more of a problem when meat is the sole source of food or is provided in addition to a commercial diet. A surfactant disinfectant can be used to break down the fat accumulation in the water and on the walls of the enclosure. In most instances both bacteria and fungi will be present in the skin lesions associated with fat accumulation in the captive environment. It is important to recognize the fat accumulation problem early to institute appropriate cleaning measures and possible therapy. Mixed flora is often found in the dermal lesions, making identification of a single causal agent difficult. Antimicrobial therapy is indicated if bacterial involvement is suspected. Although the use of systemic antifungal medications is cost prohibitive in commercial operations, it can be used if only a small number of animals are affected. Improved hygiene, better water quality, stable temperatures, and decreased stress are essential for managing these dermatitis cases. In most instances those animals that are already showing clinical signs may not recover.

Gross lesions of LPSA are multifocal, 1- to 2-mm, gray to red foci on the ventral mandibular and abdominal scales (Figure 6-21\n). They may occasionally be observed on the ventral tail scales. These lesions can be found on any section of a scale and are flush with the scale's surface; however, they may not be clearly visible in the live animal. Often, the lesions are identified during postmortem examination after close inspection of the hide using an intense backlight (Figure 6-22, Figure 6-23\n), appearing as 1- to 2-mm clearings on the scales. The lesions are circular with well-defined margins and can be confused with tooth marks and other imperfections in the skin. Therefore, antemortem identification is not very accurate at this time. Microscopic examination of the skin lesions reveals dermal nodular lymphoid proliferation with perivascular cuffing. The same changes observed in the skin have been found in the lungs, intestines, kidneys, ovaries, testicles, thyroid, gall bladder, mesentery, eyes, and nervous tissue.84 Ongoing research has revealed a strong relationship between exposure to/infection by West Nile virus and the occurrence of PIX lesions.",

Wild alligators, on the other hand, can be exposed to a number of toxic substances, mostly pesticides and heavy metals. Many of these substances are thought to be endocrine disrupters that affect the development and function of the reproductive organs and result in developmental defects of young crocodilians.85, 86, 87, 88, 89 There is an abundance of information to support the impact of environmental contamination on crocodilians as well as other species.

            "text": "Antimicrobial therapy presents a challenge in crocodilians because of their extra label use. In commercial alligator facilities, antimicrobial treatment is complicated by the lack of drug withdrawal times for crocodilian species. Currently the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) have no recommendations on this subject. From a public health standpoint there is hope that this may change in the future. Alligator meat can be purchased from supermarkets and restaurants in the United States, primarily in the southern United States. At this time, a recommended addition of 60 to 90 days to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) food animal withdrawal time, listed for a particular drug should provide enough time for appropriate withdrawal in crocodilians, but there is no research to support this claim. If the animals are not intended for human consumption, antimicrobials can be used extra label as in other exotic species. There are few pharmacokinetic studies of antimicrobials in crocodilians. Helmick et al. examined the pharmacokinetics of both enrofloxacin and a long-acting oxytetracycline in the American alligator (A. mississippiensis).\n91, 92 Enrofloxacin was found to be effective when administered at 5 mg/kg IV every 36 hours.91 The long-lasting oxytetracycline was found to be effective at 10 mg/kg both IV and intramuscularly (IM) every 5 days.92 Both of these treatment regimes may be practical in a zoologic institution or a commercial operation with a small number of animals. In a large commercial operation where a higher number of animals may need treatment, it may be time, cost, and labor prohibitive to administer medications intramuscularly or intravenously to individual animals. Spectrum of coverage, method and frequency of administration, and cost should be considered when selecting an antimicrobial agent(s). Consideration should be given to those drugs that can be mixed with, or injected into, the feed. One technique of antibiotic administration is making a sausage filled with the animal's feed and placing the drug in the sausage. Manual medication by mouth or injection can be performed in smaller animals. Whenever possible, culture and sensitivity test should be obtained to identify the organism in question and determine the efficacy of the antimicrobial selected. Unless a bacterial infection is suspected, use of antibiotics is strongly discouraged. Most antimicrobial agents and their metabolites will be transported in the wastewater, potentially creating an avenue for future antimicrobial resistance.",

Placing an esophagostomy tube should be considered as a less stressful alternative method of feeding the critical crocodilian. Nutritional support through an esophagostomy tube will require restraint while feeding, but the stress level is reduced because the mouth does not have to be opened. Any high-protein feed (e.g., commercial feed, fresh prey) that can be blended may be used as long as it can easily pass through the tube.

When transporting large, aggressive animals, veterinarians might use these agents to prevent injury to both the handlers and the animal. However, these drugs do not have analgesic properties and should not be used alone for any surgical procedures. When using neuromuscular blocking agents, veterinarians should ensure the animal is supported with a backboard to minimize injury to the spine. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker with primary action at the nerve end plate, and flaccid or rigid paralysis may occur depending on the dose.5, 93 There is no reversal agent for succinylcholine, so it must be used with caution and the animals monitored closely. Effects can be observed within 5 minutes of administration, and recovery takes up to 1.5 hours. Recovery will depend on the excretion of the drug in the urine and metabolism of the crocodilian. Gallamine is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular agent that competitively blocks acetylcholine at the motor end plate, resulting in flaccid paralysis. Crocodilians immobilized with gallamine will open their mouths following relaxation of the muscles; this is known as the Flaxidil reaction.\n5 Increased respiratory rate and heart rate may be observed with gallamine immobilization.94, 95 An overdose of gallamine may lead to bradycardia, mydriasis, increased gastrointestinal motility, and paralysis of respiratory muscles.5 Increased salivation and emesis can be prevented with presurgical use of atropine.95 An advantage of gallamine over succinylcholine is that it can be reversed with neostigmine methylsulfate. Fatalities have been reported in American alligators (A. mississippiensis), Chinese alligators (A. sinensis), and false gharials (Tomistoma schlegelii) that were administered gallamine.95 Diazepam can also be administered 20 to 30 minutes before succinylcholine or gallamine for added muscle relaxation.96 Administration and recovery of animals with neuromuscular agents should be done far from the water to avoid drowning. Noise and light stimuli should be minimized when animals have been sedated with gallamine or any other neuromuscular agent or anesthetic. Table 6-5\nshows doses for various neuromuscular agents. Following administration of a neuromuscular agent, it may be possible to intubate a crocodilian for general anesthesia with an inhalant anesthetic such as isoflurane.

The most common surgical procedure performed in zoologic institutions is probably the removal of foreign bodies through gastroscopy. This may be performed under immobilization or general anesthesia. Enterotomies are rare but may be required if a foreign body lodges itself beyond the stomach, is too large to pass on its own, or both. The next most common procedure is the repair of fractures and lacerations caused by trauma. Crocodilian fracture repair can pre-sent a real challenge to the veterinarian because of an animal's large size, demeanor, and need to live in an aquatic environment. Therefore, it is preferred to perform fracture repairs with internal fixation methods, such as intramedullary pins, cerclage wire, and bone plates. Before attempting a surgical procedure, any veterinarian must realistically determine the prognosis for the animal.",
