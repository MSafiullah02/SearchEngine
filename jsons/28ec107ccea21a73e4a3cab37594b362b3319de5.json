To overcome these hazards, the industry of the future must be based on: (i) speci\u00aec pathogen-free and genetically improved shrimp stocks; (ii) biosecure systems including enclosed, reduced water-exchange/increased water-reuse culture systems; (iii) biosecure management practices; and (iv) co-operative industry-wide disease control strategies. Speci\u00aec pathogen-free shrimp are those that are known to be free of speci\u00aeed pathogens and such stocks will ensure that seed shrimp are not the conduit for introduction of pathogens and that if pathogens are encountered the stocks will not be severely affected. Commercially acceptable biosecure culture systems that are under cover and use recirculated sea water will need to be developed for shrimp production. Adherence to operating protocols that incorporate strict biosecurity practices, including restricted access and disinfection strategies, will need to become standard. Co-operative efforts will include: early warning surveillance; co-ordination of harvest and water exchange schedules of contaminated ponds; processor co-operation to ensure that processing wastes are not threats; quick response to outbreaks.",

            "text": "Although aquaculture of marine shrimp dates back to ancient times, the practice was primarily incidental to brackish water \u00aesh culture until the 1970s. Stimulated by advances in shrimp reproduction and hatchery technologies, rapid development of shrimp farming culminated in the explosive growth observed during the 1980s. In 1980, culture contributed 44 tonnes or about 3% of the world's supply of shrimp, but by the end of the decade shrimp farm production had erupted to over 500,000 tonnes and accounted for almost 30% of the world's supply (Rosenberry 1989) . In the 1990s production of cultured shrimp increased less dramatically and over the past several years production has plateaued at around 700,000 tonnes per annum (Rosenberry 1995 ; Figure 1 ). The stagnation of growth has continued despite an ever increasing number of hectares used for production.",

            "text": "The reason for the languishing growth in production is related to the increasing number of mass mortalities in pond culture throughout the world. In 1985 Taiwan experienced a drop in production of nearly 70%. During the period 1987\u00b11990 the highly successful pond culture of Penaeus stylirostris in northwestern Mexico began a dramatic decline (Lightner et al. 1992) . In 1992, Ecuador began to experience a rash of mass mortalities in grow-out ponds resulting in a drop in production. China ceased being the largest exporter of cultured shrimp in 1993 and by 1995 had become a net importer. Other major shrimp farming countries such as Thailand, the Phillippines, Indonesia, and India have recently been affected by dramatically lowered survival rates. These episodes of shrimp mortality may be attributable to one of four viral disease agents: infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) (Lightner et al. 1983a (Lightner et al. , 1983b Bonami et al. 1990 ), Taura syndrome virus (TSV) Hasson et al. 1995; Lightner et al. 1995) , yellow head virus (YHV) Flegel et al. 1995; 1995a) , or white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) (Takahashi et al. 1994; Wongteerasupaya et al. 1995b; Lightner 1996) .",

Not only are the C-1 pathogens highly pathogenic but they are also untreatable (Table 1) ; these are of the greatest concern to the shrimp-farming industry. Four shrimp viruses are presently recognized to be C-1 pathogens: IHHNV and TSV are primarily problems in the Americas and YHV and WSSV are problems in Asia.

In the laboratory, transmission of infections can be achieved by injection of cell-free extract of infected shrimp, by ingestion of infected material, or by exposure to ef\u00afuent from aquaria housing infected shrimp (Lightner et al. 1983b) . The mode of transmission outside the laboratory is likely to be by ingestion of dead infected shrimp or by contact with water containing infected animals. Furthermore, there is evidence that vertical transmission of IHHNV occurs from the mother to offspring, either through viral particles being shed at the time of spawning and then ingested by larvae at \u00aerst feeding, or directly by transmission to larvae by passage of virus in oocytes. In our laboratory we have detected the virus in tissue sections treated with BS4.5, a gene probe for IHHNV developed by Don Lightner (D. Lightner, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA, personnal communication). Virus can be detected in ovarian tissues surrounding oocytes as well as in developing oocytes (J.M. Lotz, unpublished work). Size (age) at exposure is a factor in the susceptibility and pathogenicity of IHHNV in P. stylirostris. Bell & Lightner (1987) found that animals 1\u00b15 g in size were much more likely to succumb to infection than were 14 g subadults.",

IHHNV is widely distributed in aquaculture facilities throughout Asia and the Americas but its distribution among wild stocks is much less well documented. Lotz et al. (1991) and Lightner et al. (1992) report that wild stocks of shrimp carrying IHHNV infections occur throughout the eastern Paci\u00aec Ocean. IHHNV is also widely distributed among culture facilities in Asia (Lightner 1996) and probably occurs in some Asian wild shrimp stocks although no direct evidence for this is available. It is clear from the work of Lightner et al. (1992) , that IHHNV was introduced from aquaculture into wild stocks of P. stylirostris in the Gulf of California along western Mexico. This suggests that the virus may have been introduced into the wild from aquaculture throughout most of its distribution, and it suggests that aquaculture is a major mode for viral dissemination among native populations. The effect of IHHNV on wild stocks is largely unknown, although Lightner et al. (1992) suggest that its introduction was associated with a decline in shrimp landings in the Gulf of California.",

Elevated death rates last only a few days but commonly reach 25% per day and leave a mere 5\u00b125% of the shrimp alive. Survivors carry latent infections for at least a year and probably for life (J.M. Lotz, unpublished work). It does not appear that larger (older) animals are more resistant to mortality induced by TSV particularly if animals are exposed to the same dose on a per gram basis (J.M. Lotz, unpublished work). TSV is a particularly virulent pathogen of P. vannamei, the most commonly cultured shrimp in the Americas Hasson et al. 1995) ; Brock et al. (1995) found TSV to be less virulent to P. stylirostris; Overstreet et al. (1997) found TSV to be lethal to P. setiferus. In addition, although Overstreet et al.

However, what is often less well appreciated, is the threat that arises from the unintentional introduction or widespread enhancement of these viruses in wild stocks of shrimp. In aquaculture areas that are presently affected by these pathogens, large amounts of virus enter native waters during routine water exchange and during emergency drain harvests (Chantankachookin et al. 1993 ). If these viruses become established in wild stocks of shrimp, those stocks can become reservoirs for infecting pond-reared shrimp through contaminated water exchange, stocking of infected wild post-larvae or from seed produced from infected wild spawners. In addition to the impact on aquaculture, the viruses could be the factor that alone or in combination with environmental degradation might result in a reduction of wild harvest of the affected species.",

For example in the 1980s many farmers in the western hemisphere switched from P. stylirostris to P. vannamei to remove the immediate threat from IHHNV; however, IHHNV was still a problem in P. vannamei seed production where it caused runt deformity syndrome. Now TSV, which is devastating to P. vannamei but is apparently less virulent in P. stylirostris is causing farmers to consider switching back to P. stylirostris. Such a change would probably expose farmers to losses from IHHNV. At present no penaeid shrimp species are known to be resistant to WSSV.",

The system was covered, but it used water recirculation only for aeration and employed a daily water exchange of 280% late in the grow-out cycle. Although the system used large amounts of untreated water, the source of the water was not surface open sea water, but a shallow subsurface well-\u00aeeld; well water is generally more biosecure than open sea water (Lotz et al. 1995) . Nonetheless, the operation failed, not because the system was unproductive, but because of contamination by a C-1 pathogen, IHHNV. Moore & Brand (1993) attributed the outbreak to the failure to follow consistently the biosecurity practices that had been set up. However, it is possible that the shallow well was too shallow because ef\u00afuent waste water from the facilities was subsequently shown to seep back into it (Moore & Brand 1993) and could have been the source of the pathogen contamination.",

Such a network would result in early warning for farmers of the movement of a dangerous pathogen into a region. In the USA, the Centres for Epidemiology and Animal Health have been developed to perform such a function for terrestrial livestock production. On a world-wide scale the Of\u00aece International des Epizooties ful\u00aells a similar role and includes aspects of aquatic animal health.",

First, a diagnostic con\u00aermation is necessary. Appropriately prepared samples should be sent to a competent aquatic animal diagnostic laboratory and reported to the proper authorities. Upon con\u00aermation of a C-1 pathogen the farm should be quarantined. All unnecessary traf\u00aec to and from the farm should be suspended. Water exchange should be discontinued, ponds should be covered with bird netting, and round-the-clock bird control measures should be implemented.",

To depopulate a pond in the safest manner shrimp should be killed, removed, and the carcasses should be incinerated, buried, or cooked. Shrimp can be killed by some means, e.g. chlorination, or an approved insecticide. Removal of shrimp could occur after draining if the water is previously disinfected or if ponds are drained into nearby empty ponds. Water should be disinfected and the disinfectant neutralized prior to discharge. Whether a pond can be safely harvested to salvage a crop will be determined by the speci\u00aecs of the pathogen (exotic or native), the threat to the environment, the threat to neighbouring farms and local laws.
