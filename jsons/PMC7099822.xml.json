She was previously in good health and was a non-smoker. In addition, she had fever, chills, and a maximum body temperature of 38 \u00b0C. She did not have urinary or fecal incontinence, chest pain, general fatigue, cough, or hemoptysis during the course of her disease. Following admission, results of complete blood test revealed that white blood cell count was 12.21 \u00d7 109 cells/L and the percentage of large white blood cells was 85.5%. Blood gas analysis results showed 7.480 PH, 100 mmHg PaO2, 31 mmHg PaCO2, and 23.1 mmol/L HCO3\u2212. D-dimer assay indicated a value of 5.28 mg/L. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed filling defects in the main pulmonary artery, upper and lower pulmonary artery branch (Fig. 1). There were no distinct signs of embolism in color ultrasonography examination of the upper and lower limbs. The patient was diagnosed with PE, and was treated with anticoagulation, antiplatelet aggregation, and anti-infection medications. During the 18 h after admission, the patient experienced worsening shortness of breath and anoxia and was subsequently transferred to the Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU) for non-invasive ventilator assisted ventilation. Additionally, the patient was intravenously administered alteplase once every 12 h for 3 consecutive days and 5000 units subcutaneous unfractionated heparin. Warfarin (5 mg) was orally administered once a day. On noting that the prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) were 2\u20132.5 times their respective normal levels, warfarin therapy was singly administered along with anti-infective, supportive, and oxygen therapies. Once her condition had considerably improved and the anoxia was reduced, she was discharged from the hospital.\n",

She presented to the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of our hospital for a CTPA, which revealed filling defects in the left and right branches of pulmonary artery as well as bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 2). A routine coagulation test revealed 37 s PT and 3.33 INR, and a D-dimer assay showed a value of 8.75 mg/L. No abnormalities were observed in limb color ultrasonography, tumor antigen testing, or surrogate markers of autoimmune diseases (anti-nuclear antibody, anti-RNP antibody, anti-CCP antibody, c-ANCA, p-ANCA, anti-SS-A antibody, and anti-SS-B antibody). Based on the monitoring of PT and INR, we decided to discontinue warfarin to prevent an overdose situation. Relevant contraindications were excluded and the patient underwent interventional inferior vena cava filter implantation combined with thrombolysis implantation therapy, along with low-dose urokinase. Following surgery, she continued to receive anticoagulant treatment. On considerably improvement in her condition, she was discharged.\n",

A CTPA (Fig. 3) revealed no evident improvement of the thrombosis in the right and left main pulmonary artery, progression of pneumonia, and a reduced right pleural effusion, compared with the previous CTPA. Once again, the tumor associated antigen test was performed. Tumor antigen testing revealed an elevated Ca125 level of 69.16 U/ml (normal value < 35 U/ml) and Ca199 level of 30.22 U/ml (normal value < 27 U/ml). She was treated with anticoagulation, anti-infection, supportive, and oxygen therapies.

In November 2018, she was once again admitted to our hospital. Results of enhanced chest CT scan revealed a bilateral PE, bilateral pulmonary infection, right pleural thickening, and pleural effusion (Fig. 4). She completed the CT-guided pleural biopsy and postoperative histopathology revealed the tumor consisting of squamous cells were arranged in the nest bulk with invasive growth (Fig. 5a).

Cancer is a well-known risk factor for PE, and lung cancer is the most common malignancy coexisting in patients with PE [12]. Studies have demonstrated that the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with cancer is much greater than that in the general population [13], with some studies reporting that patients with cancer are at a 4\u20137-fold higher risk of PE than those without cancer [5, 14]. Blom et al. reported that patients with hematologic malignancies are at the highest risk of PE, followed by those with lung and gastrointestinal cancers [5]. In addition, venous thrombosis is probably a symptom of occult malignancy, with PE often being the first symptom in patients with malignant tumor [15]. Similarly, this patient with PPSCC presented in a subtle manner, with PE as the initial symptom. Owing to the rarity of PPSCC, no published reports exist that describe PPSCC presenting with PE.",

To date, no association has been demonstrated between PPSCC and environmental factors classically associated with other pleural and pulmonary neoplasms, such as tobacco and asbestos exposure [7]. However, we conducted a literature search and found some cases of squamous cell carcinoma arising from the pleura in patients with chronic empyema or subjected to therapeutic pneumothorax for active tuberculosis [3, 18].

Pleural fluid cytology for malignant cells is the simplest way to diagnose malignant tumors, but the diagnostic yield of pleural fluid cytology is low [19]. In recent years, PET-CT has been increasingly used to diagnose and stage primary malignancies [20]. Some reports have confirmed that a PET-CT can accurately distinguish between benign and malignant tumors, as pleural malignancy shows increased FDG uptake [20, 21]. The gold standard for the diagnosis of a pleural tumor involves the pathological analysis of a pleural biopsy. Percutaneous CT-guided Tru-Cut needle biopsies are considered a superior diagnostic method. The reported rate of diagnostic sensitivity on CT guidance to target areas of pleural disease has been shown to increase the sensitivity to 87.5% [22]. However, thoracoscopy pleural biopsy is now widely considered the gold standard diagnostic modality with a diagnostic yield of up to 99% [23, 24].",

Total surgical resection is the best treatment for early PPSCC. As a minimally invasive procedure, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is the optimal method for the removal of early pleural tumors [25, 26]. Early PPSCC can be removed by VATS; if it is not possible to obtain the surgical margin of the tumor using VATS, the procedure should be converted to an open thoracotomy [27]. For tumors with unclear boundaries and suspected malignant pleural nodules, intraoperative frozen examination should be used to determine whether an extended resection should be performed to reduce the risk of recurrence and improve the prognosis [2, 25]. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are considered for patients with recurrence or for those who are inoperable. However, little data exists regarding the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in these patient groups. Owing to the recurrence of PE in our patient, her condition was severe and she was administered palliative treatment.",

Early PPSCC is difficult to detect, which may result in substantial delays in the diagnosis and treatment. However, PET-CT is a crucial functional imaging technique for detecting malignant pleural lesions and assessing the extent of tumor involvement. Malignant tumors should be considered in patients with no risk factors for PE and in those with recurrent or refractory PE. PE is likely to be a symptom of occult malignancy. In this situation, a careful physical examination together with imaging-assisted techniques and measurement of tumor markers is of utmost importance to promptly identify a tumor.",
