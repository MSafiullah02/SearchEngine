            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are common agents of human infections [1]. Due to their similar genomic organization, they are classified within the same family Picornaviridae together with the human enteroviruses (HEV) [2, 3]. However, the common genomic features reflect modestly the characteristics of these viruses in terms of tropism and pathogenic potential. HRVs generally cause mild infections, replicating in the upper respiratory tract, but, in infants and immunocompromised patients, HRVs can reach the lower respiratory tract causing serious illnesses and act as pathogens or copathogens in bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [4, 5]. Recently a new HRV lineage designated HRV-C has been identified using molecular methods and associated with severe clinical presentations in infants and immunocompromised adults [6]. The majority of HEVs instead replicate in the gastrointestinal tract, eventually spreading to other organs such as the heart or the central nervous system giving rise to serious diseases. Only a few HEV genotypes can occasionally be identified in the respiratory secretions of patients with lower respiratory tract infections [5, 7]. Moreover, a novel HEV (HEV 104) was identified in Switzerland and later in other countries often in association with respiratory signs [7, 8]. Finally, a novel HEV (HEV 109) was molecularly identified in the nose and throat swab samples collected between June 2007 and June 2008 from children enrolled in a cohort study of influenza-like illness in Nicaragua, in some cases also associated with enteric symptoms [9].",

Respiratory samples were consecutively obtained after informed consent from October 1st, 2004 to April 2007. From one to nine samples from each patient were collected every 30 days up to 180 days after transplantation. At each time point all the clinical data were collected. RNA was purified from all samples using the Qiagen RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer protocol. To investigate HRV infections, all samples, were subjected to first round amplification after sample extraction using Primers P1-1 (CAA GCA CTT CTG TYW CCC C) and P3-1 (ACG GAC ACC CAA AGT AG); and semi-nested amplification was performed using forward primer P1-1 and three reversed primers P2-1 (CAA GCA CTT CTG TYW CCC C), P2-2 (TTA GCC ACA TTC AGG AGC C) and P2-3 (TTA GCC GCA TTC AGG GG) as described previously [12]. Since HEV 109 was initially cross-amplified also with the previous amplification protocol (designed to amplify the widest number of Picornaviruses), we decided to further evaluate HEV 109 prevalence by using specific primers targeting the NTR region of HEV 109 (EV109 VP1 123F, 5\u2032-GGA GAC TGG AGC AAC TAG TAA AG-3\u2032; EV109 VP1 363R, 5\u2032-GGT GAA CAT TTC CAA TTT CCT ACG-3\u2032).",
