            "text": "Aspiration pneumonia (Asp) develops after the inhalation of colonized oropharyngeal material.1 Bacteriological studies of Asp in the early 1970s found that anaerobic organisms were predominantly isolated from the respiratory specimens.2 On the basis of these studies, antibiotics with activity against anaerobic organisms became the standard of care for patients with Asp.1 However, there were two potential limitations of these studies. First, the microbiological specimens were obtained late in the course of the illness after the development of necrotizing pneumonia or empyema, such that these isolates may have represented superinfection with anaerobic organisms. Second, the tracheal sampling was contaminated with oropharyngeal flora of less virulent anaerobic bacteria rather than true pulmonary pathogens.3, 4, 5 More recent studies using protected specimen brushes to avoid oropharyngeal flora contamination found no anaerobic organisms,6, 7 suggesting that anaerobic antibiotic agents might be dispensable in the absence of severe periodontal disease, putrid sputum, necrotizing pneumonia or lung abscess formation. Moreover, the role of anaerobic bacteria in aspiration syndrome has been overemphasized in clinical practice.8 According to current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines, anaerobic coverage for community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP) is indicated only in those patients with gingivitis and a risk for loss of consciousness as seen with seizure disorders, alcohol abuse or oesophageal motility disorders9 and are not specifically recommended in patients with healthcare\u2010associated pneumonia (HCAP) in the absence of these risk factors.10\n",

All variables with P < 0.05 were kept in the model. For continuous variables, we evaluated the data based on groups to see if risk was linear.

To do this, multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate ICU LOS and logistic regression was used to evaluate mortality risk. In all of these analyses, the following factors were assessed to see if they might confound the relationship: age, BMI, Charlson co\u2010morbidity index, risk of mortality based on MPM0 score and clinically diagnosed pneumonia type.

Our data suggest that the severity of illness was an independent predictor of the choice to prescribe these antibiotics, even when there was no clear indication to do so. There was a twofold increase in inappropriate anaerobic antibiotic use in those with a predicted mortality score above the 75th percentile. The relationship between antibiotic prescription and severity of illness has been reported by others. Children with respiratory infections were more likely to be prescribed an antibiotic if the clinician perceived the child to be moderately to severely unwell.15 Williams et al. found that the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score was a significant factor affecting the number of antibiotics prescribed in patients.16 One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the clinician may add antibiotics if they perceive that the patient is more ill even if there is no justification for their use. We surmise that this effect may be more pronounced when covering for presumed anaerobic bacteria, because these microbes are rarely isolated in the hospital laboratory.",

Indeed, oftentimes, a clear rationale was not documented in the notes as to how the diagnosis of CAP, HCAP or Asp was determined. Surveys were not done in our study, which may have revealed possible reasons for choosing the diagnosis of pneumonia type. One potential reason was that the choice of antibiotics (and the initial diagnosis of pneumonia type) was initially made by the resident and fellow, rather than the more experienced attending staff.

The criteria used to measure inappropriate anaerobic antibiotic use (witnessed aspiration, evidence of periodontal disease or have a co\u2010morbidity with a high risk for aspiration) was in part based on the GI, which rates gingival disease on a scale of 0\u20133.
