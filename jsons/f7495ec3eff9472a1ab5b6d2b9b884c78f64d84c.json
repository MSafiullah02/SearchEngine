The rate of imported cases p was calculated from real data of Wenzhou. Initial values of the susceptible, asymptomatic, symptomatic, quarantined, isolated, and removed individuals on January 21 were respectively estimated as S=9249870, E=76, I=16, Q=36, J=2, and R=0 from real data of Wenzhou. Specifically, as for the number of asymptomatic individuals, because the mean incubation period was nearly 5 days, cases whose onset date was between January 22 and 26 were asymptomatic on January 21. We also assumed those who had exposed history were quarantined at initial time. So the number of asymptomatic individuals was estimated as the number of cases whose onset date was between January 22 and 26 and didn't have exposed history. Wenzhou took a series of measures since January 21. The epidemic curve was simulated starting on January 21, 2020. For simplicity, a two-stage optimization was used for simulating the epidemic dynamic in Wenzhou. In the first stage, measures were taken from January 21 to February 3. The epidemic curve was simulated with the baseline parameter values. In the second stage, stronger measures were taken after February 3. The curve was simulated with 50% reduction in and and",
