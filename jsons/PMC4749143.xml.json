            "text": "Plants offer a highly attractive system for the large\u2010scale, economical production of vaccines, antibodies and other therapeutic proteins. Much of our work at Planet Biotechnology has focused on a class of therapeutic recombinant proteins known as immunoadhesins. An immunoadhesin is a chimeric antibody\u2010like protein that combines the ligand\u2010binding region of a receptor or adhesion molecule with immunoglobulin constant domains. Not every immunoglobulin Fc fusion protein can be considered an immunoadhesin. For example, Eftrenonacog alfa is a recombinant protein in which factor IX, the blood clotting factor, has been fused with Fc to achieve an extended half\u2010life (Miguelino and Powell, 2014). Immunoadhesins are generally intended to function in much the same manner as many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): by binding with exquisite specificity to a particular ligand, blocking the interaction of that ligand with its native receptor. The term was coined in 1989 to describe recombinant fusions of CD4, the receptor for HIV\u20101 and portions of immunoglobulin G (Capon et al., 1989). An immunoadhesin combining the extracellular portion of the human tumour necrosis factor\u2010alpha receptor (TNFR) and the human IgG1 hinge and Fc regions was first developed in 1991 as a TNF inhibitor (Ashkenazi et al., 1991; Peppel et al., 1991) and eventually given the name Etanercept. FDA approved for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory indications under the trade name Enbrel\u00ae, it has been the highest selling biopharmaceutical for at least the last 10 years. FDA has approved five other immunoadhesins, all of which are designed to interfere with human receptor/ligand interactions: Alefacept (CD2\u2010directed LFA\u20103) (Strober and Menon, 2007), Abatacept (CTLA\u20104) (Korhonen and Moilanen, 2009), Belatacept (CTLA\u20104) (Larsen et al., 2005), Rilonacept (IL\u20101 and IL\u20101 receptor accessory protein) (Hoffman et al., 2012) and Aflibercept (VEGF receptor 1 and 2) (Holash et al., 2002). Immunoadhesins and other immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins approved and in development have recently been comprehensively reviewed (Linderholm and Chamow, 2014a,b).",

            "text": "Immunoadhesins have three critical advantages over soluble receptor fragments that are related to half\u2010life, affinity and ease of purification. While free receptor fragments are typically very short lived in circulation, the ability of Fc to bind to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) imparts an extended circulating half\u2010life (Capon et al., 1989; Kurschner et al., 1992; Rath et al., 2015; Weinblatt et al., 1999). Most immunoadhesins are bivalent homodimers, and bivalency can result in increased affinity or avidity for the ligand (Ashkenazi and Chamow, 1997). Finally, binding of Fc to Protein A facilitates purification.",

The development of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) is common following repeated dosing with human mAbs, and patients who develop substantial ADA levels may experience loss of efficacy. Typically, this immune response is an anti\u2010idiotype immune response (Bartelds et al., 2010; van Schouwenburg et al., 2013b). Immunoadhesins elicit lower ADA titers than mAbs, and these ADAs are generally non\u2010neutralizing (van Schouwenburg et al., 2013a). This may be because the linker region connecting receptor and Fc is often the only foreign part of these molecules.",

Immunoadhesins derived from host receptors have the potential to be effective therapeutics, with possible advantages over anti\u2010infective mAbs. Immunoadhesins that bind to viruses or toxins can not only interfere with binding to host receptors, but via Fc effector functions can promote clearance and target the virus or toxin to antigen\u2010presenting cells, jump\u2010starting an active immune response. In addition, as decoy molecules for toxins and viral receptor\u2010binding proteins, immunoadhesins may be less vulnerable to the development of escape mutants than monoclonal antibodies. The reasons for this will be elaborated in section \u2018CMG2\u2010Fc\u2019.",

Human rhinoviruses (HRV) cause up to 50% of all adult colds and 25% of colds in children (Bella and Rossmann, 1999; Sperber and Hayden, 1988), with the cost to society running to billions of dollars per year. Of the 102 characterized HRV serotypes, 91 (the major group) share as their receptor the cell surface glycoprotein intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101 (ICAM\u20101) (Greve et al., 1989; Staunton et al., 1989). ICAM\u20101 has five extracellular immunoglobulin\u2010like domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain. The binding site for HRV is located within N\u2010terminal domain 1 (Greve et al., 1991; Staunton et al., 1990). ICAM\u20101 is expressed on many cells important in immune and inflammatory responses, as well as on respiratory epithelial cells (Casasnovas et al., 1998). Recombinant, soluble forms of ICAM\u20101 (sICAM\u20101) consisting of the extracellular domains can block infection of human cells in vitro by all major group but not minor group HRV serotypes (which use a different receptor) (Crump et al., 1993; Greve et al., 1991; Marlin et al., 1990; Ohlin et al., 1994).",

In chimpanzees, sICAM\u20101 was effective in preventing HRV infection when co\u2010administered with HRV or when the virus was administered 10 min later (Huguenel et al., 1997). A human clinical trial funded by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals showed that sICAM\u20101 as a nasal spray reduced the severity of experimental HRV colds and did not result in any adverse effects or evidence of absorption through the nasal mucosa (Turner et al., 1999). Also, there was no inhibition of the development of serotype\u2010specific anti\u2010HRV antibodies. It appears that Boehringer Ingelheim abandoned development of sICAM\u20101 as a common cold therapeutic because of the impracticality of the dosing regimen\u2014a 50% reduction of symptom score required 6 daily doses (4.4 mg/day) over 7 days\u2014and because of the cost of production in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.",

Against a panel of nine major HRV serotypes, an ICAM\u20101\u2010IgA1 immunoadhesin was between 50 and 143 times more potent on a weight basis than sICAM\u20101 (Crump et al., 1994). These results suggested that an ICAM\u20101 immunoadhesin had more potential than sICAM\u20101 to become an effective therapy for colds caused by HRV. However, the levels of these immunoadhesins in cell culture supernatants were very low\u2014less than 1 mg/L (Staunton et al., 1992).",

We chose the IgA2(n) allotype because it was thought to be less susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in the hinge region than IgA1 (Senior and Woof, 2005). The gene sequence was synthesized using codons frequently used by highly expressed tobacco genes and incorporating published strategies for codon optimization (Angenon et al., 1990; Chiapello et al., 1988; De Amicis and Marchetti, 2000; Sawant et al., 1999, 2001). Transcription was placed under the control of the 35S promoter in a derivative of the binary plasmid vector pBINPLUS (van Engelen et al., 1995). Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 (Hoekema et al., 1983).

The limited effectiveness of antibiotics in symptomatic patients is likely because the causal agent, B. anthracis, elaborates two toxins, lethal toxin (LeTx) and edema toxin (EdTx) that continue to damage tissue even after the bacterium is dead.",

The choice of this fragment of CMG2 was based on the sequence of the soluble CMG2 that had previously been shown to inhibit LeTx in vitro (Scobie et al., 2003) and using all three heavy chain constant domains had worked well for our ICAM\u20101\u2010IgA2 immunoadhesin. The open reading frame was cloned into a binary vector, transformed into A. tumefaciens and used for transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana using a vacuum\u2010assisted whole\u2010plant infiltration method (Kapila et al., 1997; Vaquero et al., 1999).

All of the bands visualized by Coomassie blue also reacted with anti\u2010human IgG in Western blot analysis (not shown). N\u2010terminal sequencing of these smaller fragments revealed that they began with amino acid sequences in the middle of the first IgG1 constant domain (C\u03b31), suggesting the presence there of a proteolytically sensitive site.

Neither in vitro potency, as measured by a standard cell\u2010based lethal toxin neutralization assay, nor in vivo potency, as measured in a B. anthracis spore challenge study in rabbit, were significantly affected by the presence or absence of N\u2010glycosylation (Wycoff et al., 2011). Following these early studies, only the aglycosyl form was further developed. Aglycosyl CMG2\u2010Fc in the pTRAkc plant expression vector (Schinkel et al., 2005) in A tumefaciens GV3101 (English et al., 1997) was used to transform N. tabacum. Transgenic CMG2\u2010Fc N. tabacum plants were bred through the T3 generation, which, at maturity, accumulated CMG2\u2010Fc to approximately 30 mg/kg fresh weight. This is about 10 times higher than the level reported by Andrianov et al. (2010) for a CMG2\u2010Fc construct that incorporated a slightly smaller portion of CMG2 lacking two cysteines that participate in a disulphide bond in the native protein (Lacy et al., 2004). That CMG2\u2010Fc also was about 10\u2010fold less potent in vitro than the one we produced, suggesting, again, that the specific design of an immunoadhesin can be crucial in determining its expression and biological activity. In a cell\u2010based toxin neutralization assay (TNA), the potency of an anthrax antitoxin is expressed as the EC50, or the concentration of antitoxin that reduces cytotoxicity 50% (Li et al., 2008). The EC50 for our CMG2\u2010Fc (53 ng/mL) is similar to the reported EC50 for the anti\u2010PA antibodies raxibacumab (Zhang et al., 2003), Anthim\u2122 (Mohamed et al., 2005) and AVP\u201021D9 (Sawada\u2010Hirai et al., 2004).",

The cost model used in that paper indicated that increases in mAb expression should result in substantial reduction in both production and purification costs.",

These codon variants generated significant differences in protein accumulation (up to 20\u2010fold). Surprisingly, the mRNA levels produced by the gene variants were considerably different (up to 80\u2010fold), despite using the same promoters and the same upstream and downstream UTRs in all expression constructs. Interestingly, we found a generally inverse association between protein expression level and codon adaptation index (CAI), although all of the genes tested had relatively high CAIs (0.80\u20130.95), and hence, other gene features likely outweighed CAI for impact on expression. We found that the best correlate of mRNA and protein accumulation was computationally predicted mRNA thermostability (folding minimum Gibbs free energy), with high mRNA thermostability (low Gibbs free energy) leading to high mRNA and protein levels. This was a surprising finding because researchers often try to prevent strong mRNA secondary structures, assuming that these structures impede the progress of ribosomes. We postulate that thermodynamically stable mRNA secondary structures play a key role in facilitating high protein accumulation in plants and could be an effective approach for improving production of biotherapeutics in plants.

            "text": "One challenge in designing a DAF immunoadhesin is the presence of an N\u2010linked glycosylation site in the DAF protein. The role of this N\u2010glycan in binding to Hantavirus is not known, so the effect of differences in N\u2010glycan structure resulting from plant expression could not be predicted. Thus, we made three glycosylation variants based on a prototype DAF\u2010Fc construct with 252 aa of human DAF + hinge and Fc of human IgG1 (aglycosyl). The variants included the following: (i) complex DAF\u2010Fc, with complex\u2010type N\u2010glycan in DAF with plant\u2010specific (\u03b11,3\u2010fucose and \u03b21,2\u2010xylose) residues; (ii) high mannose DAF\u2010Fc with C\u2010terminal SEKDEL, resulting in high mannose\u2010type N\u2010glycan in DAF; and (iii) aglycosyl DAF\u2010Fc, in which the glycosylation site in DAF is abolished by changing the Asn residue to Gln. All three DAF\u2010Fc variants expressed at high levels in N. benthamiana (540 mg of protein/kg leaves) and bound in ELISA to recombinant human CD97 (Figure S5), the receptor for cellular DAF (Hamann et al., 1996), significantly better than rhDAF.",

The reason for this is unclear. There were differences between all of the DAF\u2010Fc glycoforms and the glycoforms on the rhDAF. It is possible that the specific nature of the DAF N\u2010glycan is important for binding to virus, but not for binding to CD97. It is also possible that the DAF\u2010Fc fusion perhaps is sterically unfavourable to Hantavirus binding, unlike the soluble rhDAF. Additional engineering may be needed to generate a fully functional DAF immunoadhesin.",

Immunoadhesins may be particularly useful against pathogens with high mutation rates or multiple pathogens that share cellular receptors. Also, immunoadhesins can be developed for emerging diseases as soon as their receptors are elucidated. Important design considerations should be whether to use the full or partial receptor, whether to mutate the receptor to improve binding affinity, as well as linker choice and Fc isotype choice.",

Plants have certain advantages over other expression systems for the production of immunoadhesins, which cannot easily be made in bacterial expression systems because of their complexity and requirement for intra\u2010 and interchain disulphide bonds. Because they act primarily as receptor antagonists, high immunoadhesin concentrations may be needed to achieve a biological effect, depending on receptor affinity and biological ligand concentration. In cases where high immunoadhesin doses are required, the economics of plant production become more important.",

We found, with CMG2\u2010Fc, that our initial design needed to be modified to achieve a stable, functional protein. The very first immunoadhesin, CD4\u2010Fc, while exhibiting great promise as an HIV therapeutic 25 years ago based on in vitro data, has been disappointing in the clinic (Fletcher et al., 2007; Schooley et al., 1990). However, recently published work showed that judicious protein engineering improved the stability, solubility and potency of CD4. Six copies of the engineered single domain CD4 and two copies of an antibody domain (m36.4) that target the coreceptor\u2010binding site on gp120 were fused to IgG1 and kappa constant regions. The resulting hexavalent immunoadhesin was 200 times as potent as a clinically tested sCD4\u2010Fc in vitro and neutralized a much broader range of HIV\u20101 isolates, including several that were not neutralized by the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody 2G12 (Chen et al., 2014). A concern raised by the paper's authors was that the relatively complex structure of the fusion protein might pose potential challenges for large\u2010scale production. Perhaps expression in plants should be considered.",
