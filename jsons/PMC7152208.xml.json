These alterations encompass a variety of direct and indirect effects, many of which are associated with the intended pharmacology of the compound but may also be related to off-target effects. Alterations in the hematopoietic system are commonly reflected by changes in the peripheral blood components. Blood components include leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. Leukocyte subtypes in humans and common laboratory species include neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil counts. The erythrocyte component includes both total erythrocyte and reticulocyte counts. The complete blood count (CBC) is the standard method for analyzing blood leukocyte, erythrocyte, and platelet components. Absolute concentrations (cells \u03bcL\u2212 1), conventionally referred to as absolute counts in nonclinical toxicity studies, should be used to evaluate and interpret changes in blood components because relative percentages do not account for the total numbers of cells present and may be misleading.",

Increases in circulating catecholamines are commonly associated with excitement, fear, or exercise, and at times are referred to as acute stress. Increases in neutrophil counts secondary to catecholamine stimulation are mostly attributable to a shift in neutrophils from the marginating pool to the circulating pool, resulting in increased numbers of freely flowing neutrophils captured during blood sampling, and may occur through decreased expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and potentially from increased blood flow and shear forces (Foster et al., 1986, Benschop et al., 1996, Stockham and Scott, 2008a, Everds et al., 2013a). Splenic contraction resulting in redistribution of sequestered neutrophils to circulation also contributes. Mechanisms by which exogenous catecholamines and adrenergic agents cause increases in blood neutrophil counts are the same as those described for endogenous catecholamine stimulation.",

The predominant endogenous steroids are cortisone in most species or corticosterone in the rat. Classically, endogenous steroids cause increases in neutrophil counts that are accompanied by decreases in lymphocyte counts, increases in monocyte counts, and decreases in eosinophil counts. However, these effects may be variable depending on the species, and increases in neutrophil counts may be less prominent or absent in rats and mice. Interpretation of a stress or endogenous glucocorticoid effect in a nonclinical toxicity study should be made conservatively using a weight of evidence approach. It should also be noted that hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing syndrome or hypercortisolism) is associated with excess production of endogenous glucocorticoids, and will also cause increases in blood neutrophil counts through glucocorticoid-mediated mechanisms.",

They downregulate neutrophil expression of adhesion molecules, leading to both a shift from marginating to circulating pools, and by prolongation of neutrophil lifespan in circulation due to decreased tissue emigration (Stockham and Scott, 2008a). Neutrophil half-life may also be prolonged due to decreased apoptosis (Cox, 1995). These increases in neutrophil lifespan may be associated with hypersegmentation of neutrophil nuclei that can be observed during blood smear evaluation. Glucocorticoids also increase the release of segmented and occasionally band neutrophils from the bone marrow storage pool, although this mechanism contributes to the neutrophilia to a lesser degree than shifting to the circulating pool (Stockham and Scott, 2008a, Nakagawa et al., 1998). Bone marrow expansion of all stages of myeloid cells may also be increased by glucocorticoid stimulation (Trottier et al., 2008). Administration of exogenous glucocorticoids, such as prednisolone and dexamethasone, will result in similar effects on blood leukocyte counts.",

A left shift may be categorized as degenerative, indicating a greater number of immature neutrophils than mature neutrophils, or regenerative, where mature neutrophils are present in greater numbers than the immature neutrophils. Degenerative left shifts are typically observed in the face of decreased or low-normal blood neutrophil counts when the tissue demand exceeds bone marrow neutrophil production, while regenerative left shifts tend to occur with increased blood neutrophil counts when bone marrow production is starting to meet the tissue demand.",

Due to acceleration of granulopoiesis, morphologic changes may occur in the cytoplasm of neutrophils. These changes include D\u00f6hle bodies (remnants of rough endoplasmic reticulum that contain RNA), foamy cytoplasmic vacuolation, increased cytoplasmic basophilia, and evidence of asynchronous cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation (e.g., large neutrophils, lobes of immature nuclear chromatin with filamentous segmentation, or presence of primary granules in more mature stages). These changes are often referred to as \u201ctoxic\u201d changes, but they are more accurately cellular morphologic alterations that are considered an indicator of rapid/accelerated neutrophil production.",

A leukemoid response is characterized by a persistent leukocytosis of > 50,000 cells \u03bcL\u2212 1, typically due to a marked neutrophilia with a left shift that remains orderly and may or may not have morphologic changes indicative of rapid granulopoiesis (Schultze, 2010, Sakka et al., 2006). Extreme neutrophilia typically has > 100,000 cells \u03bcL\u2212 1 and evidence of a left shift. The terms leukemoid reaction and extreme neutrophilia are most appropriately applied retrospectively, after the possibility for hematopoietic neoplasia has been excluded. Differentiation of a leukemoid response or extreme neutrophilia from chronic myelogenous leukemia or chronic neutrophilic leukemia includes CBC, blood smear, and bone marrow evaluations in most species, and may also include leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analysis (e.g., evaluation for bcr\u2013abl translocation), serum G-CSF, and clonality evaluations in humans (Schultze, 2010, Sakka et al., 2006). Leukemoid reactions have been associated with carcinomas of various origins, including renal and pulmonary carcinomas, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, melanoma, and sarcomas, and may be attributable to aberrant production of proinflammatory mediators by the neoplasm, such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, or IL-6 (Sakka et al., 2006). Leukemoid reactions have also been reported in F334/N rats affected by large granular cell leukemia (Car et al., 2006). However, leukemoid reactions may also be associated with infectious processes, including disseminated tuberculosis, Clostridium difficile colitis, severe shigellosis (Sakka et al., 2006), chronic localized suppurative lesions such as pyometra, pleuritis, and internal abscesses (Schultze, 2010, Stockham and Scott, 2008a).

Adhesion molecules expressed on neutrophils are responsible for neutrophil margination, rolling along vessel walls, and emigration into tissues. L-selectin (CD62L) mediates low-affinity initial binding of leukocyte to endothelial cells, while integrins, including CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1), mediate firm adhesion to endothelial cells and ligands in the extracellular matrix (Muller, 2012). Neutrophils constitutively express CD11b/CD18. A deficiency of this integrin (leukocyte adhesion deficiency [LAD] type 1) results in the failure of neutrophils to emigrate to tissues, and may result in severe, recurrent bacterial infections (Arnaout, 1990). LAD type 2 is due to an inherited disorder of fucose metabolism, resulting in the lack of selectin ligands expressed on neutrophils and therefore results in immunodeficiency from a failure of selectin-mediated neutrophil rolling along vessel walls (Marquardt et al., 1999). Leukocyte adhesion deficiencies have been reported in humans, dogs, mice, and Holstein cattle (Arnaout, 1990, Marquardt et al., 1999, Gu et al., 2004).",

Leukocytosis in CML is \u2265 25,000 cells \u03bcL\u2212 1 with increases in all stages of neutrophilic myeloid cells in blood, which are typically accompanied by increases in monocyte counts, eosinophil counts, basophil counts, platelet counts, and possibly increases in nucleated erythroid precursors (Sawyers, 1999). In contrast to a leukemoid response, the left shift associated with CML tends to be less orderly, with greater numbers of earlier stages of myeloid cells in circulation along with the band and segmented neutrophils. Morphologic features indicative of dysplasia may be seen, and cytoplasmic features indicative of rapid granulopoiesis may be observed in neutrophils associated with CML. Bone marrow findings include hypercellularity with increased myeloid to erythroid ratios where myeloblasts and promyelocytes make up < 10% of all cells (Sawyer, 1999). Most human cases of chronic myeloid leukemia have been associated with a translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 (Philadelphia chromosome) resulting in the constitutively active BCR\u2013ABL tyrosine kinase, an oncogene that induces leukemias (Sawyers, 1999). A comparable bcr\u2013abl translocation has been observed in dogs (Breen and Modiano, 2008, Cruz Cardona et al., 2011, Culver et al., 2013), and transgenic and knock-in mouse models for bcr\u2013abl translocation-induced CML have been utilized in research (Ren, 2005).",

While the goal for treatment in chemotherapy patients is to increase blood neutrophil counts to normal levels and not to achieve increased neutrophil counts, repeated or high dose administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF-related compounds to healthy laboratory animals results in markedly increased neutrophil counts. Typically these changes are associated with a left shift and cytoplasmic changes indicative of rapid neutropoiesis. Dysplastic changes may also occur, most commonly recognized by the presence of unusually large neutrophils or hypersegmented neutrophils in circulation. Several xenobiotics appear to induce increases in neutrophil counts by stimulating increases in endogenous G-CSF or an inflammatory stimulus. Early in the course of treatment with clozapine, an antipsychotic agent, rats have been shown to have spikes in G-CSF with concomitant increases in bone marrow granulopoiesis and release of less mature neutrophils into circulation (Lobach and Uetrecht, 2014). However, other xenobiotics may directly cause an inflammatory stimulus and increase in endogenous proinflammatory stimuli, such as G-CSF and IL-1, which result in increases in neutrophil counts. For example, lithium, which has been used in treatment of bipolar disorder and in combination with antidepressants, also appears to cause increased neutrophil counts due to increased G-CSF (Focosi et al., 2009).",

Such an inflammatory stimulus, sometimes also referred to as peracute inflammation, is commonly observed with bacterial sepsis. Decreases in neutrophil counts are a result of emigration to tissues that exceed the bone marrow capacity to release neutrophils. Proinflammatory mediators and chemoattractants stimulate increased neutrophil margination, firm adhesion to endothelial cells, and emigration into tissue, which shortens neutrophil circulating half-lives and depletes the circulating neutrophil pool. As neutrophils are released from the bone marrow and the storage pool is depleted, recruitment of immature neutrophils into circulation results in a left shift in which the number of immature forms exceeds the number of mature segmented neutrophils (degenerative left shift). If the stimulus persists long enough, granulocytic hyperplasia of the bone marrow will occur and the numbers of circulating neutrophils will increase and shift toward greater numbers of mature than immature neutrophils.",

There is evidence that this upregulation of CD18 contributes to neutrophil vascular sequestration in the lungs and liver, but there is also evidence for other mechanisms, such as cytoskeletal changes that alter neutrophil deformability, causing the initial vascular sequestration of neutrophils that is consistently observed with endotoxemia (Wagner and Roth, 1999). The decreases in neutrophil counts associated with endotoxemia tend to be rapid but transient, and detection of these decreases in neutrophil counts will depend on timing of the blood collection in relation to endotoxemic and other concurrent or subsequent proinflammatory stimuli.",

Decreases in neutrophil counts by this mechanism tend to occur rapidly, within a few hours to 2 days after exposure (Schwartzberg, 2006). Some xenobiotics mediate their effects by acting as haptens, which induce an antibody response targeting an antigen formed by the xenobiotic\u2013neutrophil combination. Drugs reported to act as haptens include penicillin, gold-based compounds, aminopyrine, and propylthiouracil (Salama et al., 1989, Murphy et al., 1985). These xenobiotics induce neutrophil destruction in a drug-dependent manner, and discontinuation of treatment generally results in resolution of blood neutrophil counts within 7 days (Schwartzberg, 2006). Some xenobiotics, including propylthiouracil and quinidine sulfate, cause the formation of immune complexes that can subsequently bind and destroy neutrophils, even if the xenobiotic is no longer present (Schwartzberg, 2006, Bhatt and Saleem, 2004, Eisner et al., 1977). In addition, some xenobiotics, such as propylthiouracil, may also cause the formation of antineutrophil antibodies resulting in complement-mediated neutrophil destruction (Akamizu et al., 2002). Similar to idiopathic aplastic anemia, xenobiotic-induced aplastic anemia is most commonly associated with immune-mediated destruction of uncommitted or early hematopoietic stem cells, although direct cytotoxicity, such as with chemotherapeutic agents, may also lead to aplastic anemia. Several xenobiotics, including chloramphenicol, anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and carbamazepine, gold-based compounds, and phenylbutazone have been associated with aplastic anemia (Bloom and Brandt, 2008).",

Examples of chemotherapeutic classes associated with decreased blood neutrophil counts include agents that cause direct DNA damage, such as platinum-containing agents (e.g., cisplatin, carboplatin) and classical alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, melphalan, busulfan); mitotic spindle inhibitors (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinblastine, vincristine); topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide, doxorubicin); and antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 5-fluorouracil) (Bhatt and Saleem, 2004, Weiss, 2010, Wailoo et al., 2009).

Release of lymphocytes from the spleen in response to catecholamine stimulation likely also contributes to the increase in blood lymphocyte counts, but lymph nodes and bone marrow do not appear to be significant contributors (Benschop et al., 1996).

However, increases in lymphocyte counts are commonly observed with chronic inflammatory processes. Chronic stimulation of lymphocytes with antigens or cytokines results in the increased production of lymphocytes with release into the blood, causing the increases in blood lymphocyte counts. Reactive lymphocytes may be observed in blood accompanying inflammation-induced increases in lymphocytes counts. Reactive lymphocytes have a spectrum of morphologic changes that include increased cytoplasmic basophilia, large cells with mildly increased amounts of cytoplasm (lower nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios), variable patterns of chromatin clumping, and variable numbers of visible nucleoli. Occasionally, reactive lymphocytes may have paranuclear cytoplasmic clearing, giving a plasmacytoid appearance. Infectious mononucleosis syndromes in people are a relatively common cause of an inflammatory or reactive increase in lymphocyte counts that are usually acute (Vasu and Caligiuri, 2016). Chronic infections leading to increase in blood lymphocyte counts may include visceral leishmaniasis, parasitic infections such as strongyloidiasis, and leprosy (Vasu and Caligiuri, 2016, Rai et al., 2008, Myers et al., 2000). Several chronic infections, including ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and brucellosis, have been associated with increases in blood lymphocyte counts in dogs (Schultze, 2010).",

A normal circulating lymphocyte population should be heterogeneous, with predominantly small lymphocytes and fewer intermediate to large lymphocytes. Increased blood lymphocyte counts with a loss of heterogeneity in the blood lymphocyte population or predominantly a monomorphic intermediate to large lymphocyte population are key features for diagnosing lymphoproliferative neoplasia. With the exception of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is characterized by increased numbers of small lymphocytes with few or subtle morphologic alterations, circulating lymphocytes often have abnormal morphologic features that may be observed microscopically. Abnormal morphologic features of the leukemic lymphocyte population may include increased cytoplasmic basophilia, increased amounts of cytoplasm with altered nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, irregular clumping of nuclear chromatin, indentation or lobulation of nuclei, variably sized but typically prominent nucleoli, or multiple nucleoli. Some of these morphologic features are similar to those observed in reactive lymphocytes, but these two processes may be distinguished by the overall heterogeneity of the lymphocyte population and proportion of the lymphocyte population with these morphologic alterations. Additional testing, such as flow cytometry for phenotyping or PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR), also aids in the diagnosis or characterization of lymphoproliferative neoplasia.",

In addition to a rapid shift of lymphocytes from the circulating to marginating and tissue pools, there is evidence for both lymphocyte redistribution from blood to bone marrow (Fauci, 1975) and decreased efflux of lymphocytes from lymphoid tissues (Bloemena et al., 1990) contributing to the shift of lymphocytes to tissue pools. With long-term increases in glucocorticoid concentrations, lymphotoxicity may be observed due to an increased activation of apoptotic pathways (Garvy et al., 1993, Tuckermann et al., 2005). In rats, feed restriction has been associated with decreases in blood lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte depletion in various lymphoid tissues (Moriyama et al., 2008), possibly associated with prolonged stress and therefore a glucocorticoid-mediated effect. Indirect test article-related effects mediated by altered food consumption are important to consider in nonclinical toxicology studies, in which test articles may cause direct or indirect hematologic effects.

HIV-mediated lymphocyte destruction is likely multifactorial; HIV may be cytotoxic, directly induce T-cell apoptosis, induce T-cell death through a nonspecific immune response, and cause T-cell death by stimulating autophagocytic pathways (Chinen and Shearer, 2010, Stump and VandeWoude, 2007). SIV and FIV tropism for T-cells is also mediated by receptors expressed by CD4+ T-cells (Stump and VandeWoude, 2007). Simian betaretrovirus also causes decreases in blood lymphocyte counts due to infection and eventual depletion of both B-cells and T-cells, although infection of nonlymphoid cells also occurs (Montiel, 2010).",

One example, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), has been reported in humans, dogs, mice, and horses (Suter, 2010, Notarangelo, 2010, Meek et al., 2001, Felsberg et al., 1992, Custer et al., 1985). SCID may be inherited through autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive patterns, and causes consistent decreases in T-cells, with concurrent decreases in B-cells or NK-cells in some forms of the disease. SCID in humans is caused by a variety of mechanisms, including: adenosine deaminase deficiency resulting in early cell death due to metabolite accumulation; common gamma chain or janus kinase 3 (JAK3) mutations that cause decreased survival of T-cell precursors due to defective cytokine signaling; recombinase-activating gene 1 (RAG1) or RAG2 mutations that cause defective V(D)J rearrangement of B-cell and T-cell receptors; and mutations in CD3 or CD45 that cause defects in T-cell receptor signaling (Suter, 2010, Notarangelo, 2010). SCID in Jack Russell terriers, Arabian foals, and mice has been demonstrated to be caused by defective V(D)J recombination due to loss of DNA-dependent protein kinase (Meek et al., 2001). X-linked SCID has been described in both Bassett Hounds and Welsh Corgi dogs (Suter, 2010). Other inherited immunodeficiency syndromes resulting in decreases in blood lymphocyte counts include reticular dysgenesis, ataxia-telangiectasia, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (Vasu and Caligiuri, 2016).",

Inflammatory increases in eosinophil counts in response to helminths are cytokine (e.g., IL-5) mediated (Valent, 2009), but IgE and histamine release from mast cells, anaphylatoxin (e.g., C5a) production from complement activation, helper T-cell activation, and direct stimulation of eosinophils with helminthic antigens also play a role in eosinophil recruitment (Wardlaw, 2016, Leder and Weller, 2000, McEwen, 1992). Helminth migration through host tissues is a key factor in stimulating increases in blood eosinophils and tissue eosinophilic inflammation, and helminths that remain confined to the intestinal lumen may not result in an eosinophil response (Leder and Weller, 2000). The degree of the eosinophil response and increases in blood eosinophil counts are also dependent on parasite burden, maturation, and distribution in tissues (Leder and Weller, 2000). Ascariasis, strongyloidiasis, trichinosis, filariasis, and ancylosomiasis have all been associated with increases in eosinophil counts in humans (Wardlaw, 2016, Tefferi et al., 2006, Leder and Weller, 2000), and many of these may also be observed in common laboratory species (Schultze, 2010, Magden et al., 2015, Korenaga et al., 1991, Ogilvie et al., 1980). Helminth infection in most purpose-bred laboratory animals is uncommonly observed during nonclinical toxicology studies due to breeding and housing facility biosecurity measures, but several less commonly used large animal species from other sources, such as farm pigs, calves, and sheep, have helminth infections more frequently observed.",

            "text": "Allergic inflammation is another common cause of increases in blood eosinophil counts. Allergic conditions associated with increases in blood eosinophil counts include asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis although increases in eosinophil counts with these conditions are usually mild (Wardlaw, 2016). Allergic inflammation associated with immediate release of IgE is considered a type I hypersensitivity reaction. Some allergen-induced inflammation may be attributable to type IV (delayed-type or cell-mediated) hypersensitivity following TH activation with subsequent eosinophil recruitment. However, some differences have been observed between atopic dermatitis and classic type IV hypersensitivity (Gaga et al., 1991), so not all TH-mediated allergic inflammation may represent a true type IV hypersensitivity reaction. As with most forms of inflammatory increases in blood eosinophil counts, production of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-5 and eotaxin, appear to play a major role. In allergic asthma, activated T-helper type 2 (TH2) cells release or stimulate the release of these cytokines and chemokines, resulting in recruitment and activation of eosinophils (Rosenberg et al., 2013). Sensitization of the airways to ovalbumin with subsequent challenge in mice has mimicked many of the clinical and pathological features of allergic asthma, including the interaction of TH2 cells and eosinophils (Rosenberg et al., 2013). However, asthma encompasses a heterogeneous set of phenotypes and not all forms demonstrate clinical improvement in response to therapies targeting IL-5 or eosinophils (Wegmann, 2011). While asthma is uncommon in most laboratory animal species, it can be experimentally induced in mice and may occur naturally in cats. Activation of TH2 and TH1 cells have been proposed to contribute to the pathology of atopic dermatitis, with the TH2 activation being of particular relevance to the development of increases in blood eosinophil counts (Grewe et al., 1998), similar to allergic asthma. Activation of TH2 cells also plays a role in cytokine and chemokine elaboration with eosinophil recruitment in allergic rhinitis, although effects on eosinophils in allergic rhinitis are also mediated by histamine and IgE release from mast cells and histamine release from basophils (Borish, 2003).",

The \u03b2-adrenergic effects of epinephrine are believed to be the cause of the decreases in blood eosinophil counts (Koch-Weser, 1968).

Glucocorticoids cause shifts in blood eosinophils from the circulating to the marginating pool as well as decreased release of eosinophils from the bone marrow (McEwen, 1992), and may also contribute to decreases in blood eosinophil counts from inhibition of prosurvival stimulation and direct induction of apoptosis (Druilhe et al., 2003, Wallen et al., 1991).",

Studies in mice have demonstrated that the decrease in blood eosinophils associated with severe acute inflammation occurs more rapidly than increases in glucocorticoids (Bass, 1975), and injection of material from an inflammatory exudate to adrenalectomized mice still resulted in deceases in eosinophil counts (Bass, 1977), indicating the mechanism of eosinophil decrease in acute inflammation is independent of adrenal function. It is believed that acute inflammatory decreases in blood eosinophil counts are due to shifting of eosinophils from the circulating to the marginating pool and subsequent egress into tissues in response to chemotactic stimuli. Acute inflammation associated with fungal and viral infections also tends to cause decreases in eosinophil counts (Leder and Weller, 2000).",

There is also evidence that glucocorticoids cause migration of basophils from circulation into tissues and decrease recirculation from tissue back into blood (Wald et al., 1991). Direct lytic effects on blood or tissue basophils and suppression of basophil production in the bone marrow may also contribute (Boseila, 1963).

These increases in red cell mass are usually observed in conjunction with increases in urea nitrogen and/or creatinine (prerenal azotemia) with concurrent decreases in urine volume and increases in urine specific gravity, as well as proportional increases in albumin and globulin. If evaluating plasma, fibrinogen may also be increased. In nonclinical toxicology studies in rodents, decreased food consumption is often associated with concurrent decreases in water intake, resulting in increases in red cell mass from subclinical or clinical dehydration.

Binding of the VHL E3 ligase complex to HIF requires hydroxylation of a proline residue in the VHL protein, a process that requires both oxygen and iron (Ivan et al., 2001). In hypoxic states, HIF is not ubiquitinated and HIF subunits translocate to the nucleus, forming a transcription factor for genes, including the erythropoietin gene.

Neoplastic transformation, from an acquired somatic mutation (Prchal, 2016), of a hematopoietic progenitor cell results in clonal and autonomous expansion of hematopoietic cells, including erythrocytes. Eventually the clonal expansion is sufficient to suppress normal hematopoiesis (Prchal and Prchal, 2016). Increases in red cell mass are the prototypical findings, but concurrent increases in leukocyte and platelet counts that arise from the neoplastic clone are often also be observed in people (Pearson, 2001), although these findings are typically not observed in dogs or cats (Randolph et al., 2010). The most common causative somatic mutation of polycythemia vera in humans is a mutation of JAK2, a kinase that plays a role in intracellular proliferative signaling (Prchal, 2016). However, forms of polycythemia vera or \u201cidiopathic erythrocytosis\u201d without JAK2 mutations have been observed and associated with mutations in lymphocyte-specific adaptor protein (LNK) that inhibits JAK2 phosphorylation (Lasho et al., 2010). Serum EPO concentrations are expected to be low in patients with polycythemia vera. In domestic dogs and cats, middle-aged female dogs and male cats tend to be most commonly affected (Randolph et al., 2010).",

Humans are infected by one of five different Plasmodium species: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, P. malariae, or P. ovale, although only P. falciparum and P. vivax are commonly associated with severe hemolysis (Lichtman, 2016b). Macaques are most commonly infected with P. inui or P. knowlesi, although the cynomolgus monkey appears to be more resistant to disease from these infections than the rhesus monkey (Ameri, 2010). Infection with P. cynomolgi, P. fieldi, or P. fragile may also occur in macaques (Magden et al., 2015). Although it is uncommon to include macaques infected with Plasmodium species during a nonclinical toxicity study due to current screening practices and pretest evaluations, rare animals with decreases in red cell mass and increases in reticulocyte counts and intraerythrocytic Plasmodium organisms have been observed. Rats and mice may be infected with Plasmodium berghei (Holloway et al., 1995, Sadun et al., 1965). Plasmodium berghei has a specific tropism for reticulocytes rather than mature erythrocytes Plasmodium species that infect humans (Car et al., 2006, Cromer et al., 2006). Concurrent increases in reticulocyte counts may occur in early stages or disease or with recrudescence of parasitemia and hemolysis. Hemolysis is associated with clearance of parasitized erythrocytes from circulation predominantly by splenic macrophages (Lichtman, 2016b), although accumulation of hemin, an iron-containing porphyrin, which can directly stimulate apoptotic erythrocyte death (eryptosis) (Gatidis et al., 2009), oxidative damage to erythrocyte membranes (Clark and Hunt, 1983), and increased osmotic fragility (George et al., 1967) may all contribute to hemolysis. However, late-stage infections in humans and rodents have also been associated with inappropriate or decreased reticulocyte counts indicative of suppressed erythropoiesis despite decreases in red cell mass from hemolysis (Lichtman, 2016b, Cromer et al., 2006).",

Under normal conditions, ferrous iron (Fe2 +) in hemoglobin binds to and dissociates from oxygen as it delivers oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. At times, this binding and dissociation results in the formation of ferric iron (Fe3 +) in hemoglobin (methemoglobin) as well as superoxide (O2\n\u2212). Superoxide is a free radical with potent oxidative capacity that may cause cellular damage. Cytochrome b5-reductase is an intraerythrocytic enzyme that converts methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. Superoxide dismutase converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which also may produce oxidative damage to cells. Further metabolism of hydrogen peroxide by catalase or glutathione peroxidase protects cells from oxidative damage. These pathways are usually sufficient to address the normal low-level formation of methemoglobin and superoxide, but methemoglobin can increase and impair delivery of oxygen to tissues and superoxide can accumulate and cause oxidative damage if these pathways are overwhelmed or defective.",

Oxidative damage that causes the formation of eccentrocytes may result in hemolysis due to increased clearance of eccentrocytes by splenic macrophages due to trapping of rigid erythrocytes in splenic sinusoids or spontaneous rupture in blood due to the increased fragility of eccentrocytes (Stockham and Scott, 2008b).",

Denatured hemoglobin may then precipitate and aggregate within the erythrocyte, forming small, pale-staining round structures that bind to the erythrocyte membrane and tend to protrude from the surface of the erythrocyte. These aggregates of denatured hemoglobin are called Heinz bodies. Cats appear to be particularly sensitive to the formation of Heinz bodies because of an increased number of reactive sulfhydryl groups in hemoglobin relative to other species (Christopher et al., 1990), and may be more rapidly observed on blood smear evaluation due to the nonsinusoidal architecture of the feline spleen that results in decreased clearance of Heinz bodies from circulation. Similar to eccentrocytes, erythrocytes with Heinz bodies may undergo hemolysis due to increased clearance by splenic macrophages following trapping in splenic sinusoids due to decreased erythrocyte deformability and spontaneous rupture due to increased fragility from membrane damage; immune-mediated clearance may also occur and is believed to result from binding of hemochromes to and subsequent redistribution of band 3, an erythrocyte membrane structural protein, which may then be recognized by autologous antibodies (Winterbourn, 1990).",

Inherited deficiencies in erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) have also been associated with erythrocyte oxidative damage, eccentrocyte or Heinz body formation, and hemolysis or a predisposition for these events due to the loss of protective antioxidant pathways (Chan et al., 1982, Harvey, 2006).

If agglutination is present, blood smears may have a \u201creverse smear\u201d appearance with the densest region of the smear observed at the feathered edge rather than the edge where the drop of blood was initially placed. Microscopically agglutination appears as grape-like clusters of erythrocytes. Spherocytes are erythrocytes that are spherical instead of having the normal biconcave disc shape. While spherocytes appear smaller and stain more intensely pink that unaffected mature erythrocytes, they have the same volume as unaffected erythrocytes. Loss of erythrocyte membrane occurs when macrophages begin to phagocytize antibody-bound erythrocytes, leading to decreased erythrocyte surface area without an appreciable change in volume, forcing erythrocytes to form spheres. Hence, spherocytosis alone will not result in an altered MCV. Of the most common laboratory species, dogs tend to have the most pronounced central pallor of normal mature erythrocytes, making microscopic identification of spherocytes easiest in the dog.",

The mechanism of hemolysis in sickle cell disease is likely multifactorial and not associated with a single pathogenesis. There is evidence for oxidative damage to erythrocytes (Lachant et al., 1983), which may contribute to the hemolysis observed with sickle cell disease. However, hemoglobin polymerization leads to erythrocyte deformation and may lead to decreased flexibility of erythrocytes and veno-occlusive disorders (Bookchin and Lew, 1996). Decreased flexibility or deformability of erythrocytes may contribute directly to increased cell fragility and rupture or promote clearance of deformed erythrocytes by splenic macrophages, while veno-occlusive disease has the potential to cause decreases in red cell mass through physical trauma and fragmentation. However, there is also evidence that in some severe cases of sickle cell disease there may be an increase in reticulocyte counts that are inappropriate for the magnitude of the decrease in red cell mass, suggesting a concurrent mechanism causing suppressed or ineffective erythropoiesis (Wu et al., 2005, Bookchin and Lew, 1996). Oxidative stress on erythroid precursors may also contribute to ineffective erythropoiesis in some severe cases of sickle cell disease (Fibach and Rachmilewitz, 2008).",

Deficiencies of PK that result in hemolysis have been reported in humans (Baronciani and Beutler, 1993), dogs including beagles (Harvey et al., 1977, Giger et al., 1991, Prasse et al., 1975), and a few breeds of cats (Kohn and Fumi, 2008).

Semisynthetic penicillins, some cephalosporins, and tetracycline have also been reported to cause drug-dependent antibody-mediated hemolysis (Garratty, 2010, Tuffs and Manoharan, 1986, Seldon et al., 1982, Gro\u00dfjohann et al., 2004, Gallagher et al., 1992, Branch et al., 1985, Simpson et al., 1985).",

Copper toxicity causes hemolysis as well, possibly through inhibition of many enzymes involved in glycolysis resulting in decreased intracellular ATP (Boulard et al., 1972). Envenomation from multiple animals is reported to cause hemolysis. Envenomation by snakes, such as rattlesnakes and coral snakes, can cause hemolysis through phospholipase A2 activity, which may cause direct hemolysis or liberate hemolysins such as lysolethicin, or through complement-mediated hemolysis (Arce-Bejarano et al., 2014, Tambourgi and van den Berg, 2014, Walton et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Hemorrhage may cause internal or external blood loss. Due to the loss of whole blood during hemorrhage, decreases in red cell mass are usually accompanied by proportionate decreases in albumin and globulin concentrations. The decreases in plasma proteins tend to be less pronounced with internal hemorrhage because the lost proteins may be resorbed in lymph and returned to blood (Stockham and Scott, 2008b). Cases of internal hemorrhage are typically not associated with iron deficiency. However, prolonged external blood loss may cause depletion of total body iron. Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by small erythrocytes with a decrease in MCV and erythrocytes that contain less hemoglobin with a decrease in MCHC, and may be classified as a microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Hemoglobin synthesis plays a role in inhibiting erythrocyte division, and when sufficient iron is not available for heme production, there is loss of the inhibitory effect resulting in more cell divisions and microcytes (Stohlman et al., 1963). Hypochromasia of the erythrocytes is due to the lower than normal hemoglobin content due to decreased production of heme. Morphologic erythrocyte changes that accompany iron deficiency anemia include visual microcytosis and hypochromasia, keratocytes and schistocytes from physical damage to the more fragile erythrocytes, and sometimes codocytes (also called target cells) that have a thin rim of pink-staining hemoglobin and a small central area of hemoglobin with a ring of pallor in between, typical of erythrocytes with less hemoglobin present relative to the amount of membrane. In chronic iron deficiency, increases in reticulocyte counts and microscopic polychromasia may be lower than expected for a regenerative anemia due to loss of RNA during the extended maturation phase of erythrocyte production caused by decreased hemoglobin content (Burkhard et al., 2001).",

Dilution of red cell mass may also be observed following administration of intravenous fluids to replace blood volume. A detectable increase in reticulocyte count is expected 3\u20134 days following the acute event in a patient with normally functioning bone marrow. Damage to blood vessels that results in hemorrhage also may occur secondary to ulcerative or neoplastic conditions. In dogs, rupture of splenic hemangiosarcoma is a common cause of internal blood loss into the abdomen (hemoabdomen). Ulceration of the gastrointestinal system may lead to blood loss into feces, which can be observed as black, tarry feces (melena) if the ulceration occurs in the small intestines or as frank blood if the ulceration occurs in the large intestines.",

Decreases in red cell mass may be acutely observed following collection of blood from donors for transfusion, and regular donors have a risk of developing iron deficiency from repeated external blood loss (Cable et al., 2011). Repeated phlebotomy is a common occurrence in nonclinical toxicology studies, particularly in dogs and nonhuman primates, although rats may also occasionally undergo repeated blood collections. Blood is collected through the studies mainly for toxicokinetic or pharmacokinetic analysis, but also for analysis of hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry profiles. Decreases in red cell mass with increases in reticulocyte counts of similar magnitude relative to pretest values across all treatment groups, including controls, are a common procedure-related phenomenon in nonclinical toxicology studies and should be distinguished from a true test article-related effect.",

However, there are also cases of inherited aplastic anemia, most commonly Fanconi anemia associated with genetic mutations that impair DNA repair resulting in pancytopenia developing around 5\u201310 years of age in people (Segel and Lichtman, 2016). A form of aplastic anemia associated with bone marrow depletion or hypocellularity of hematopoietic tissue and gelatinous transformation of marrow cavity fat has been reported with anorexia nervosa in people (Abella et al., 2002) and with severe food restriction in rats (Moriyama et al., 2008).",

Chronic iron deficiency results in impaired hematopoiesis due to the inability to synthesize sufficient hemoglobin, which may lead to a decrease in reticulocyte production. Deficiencies in folate and cobalamin also cause ineffective erythropoiesis due to defects in DNA synthesis, as discussed with folate and cobalamin deficiencies as a cause of deceases in neutrophil counts. In people, folate and cobalamin deficiencies result in megaloblastic anemia, characterized by larger than normal erythroid precursors in the bone marrow that have more cytoplasm with lower nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios than in normal erythroid precursors and asynchronous cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation (Green, 2016). Megaloblastic erythrocytes may also be observed in circulation, and basophilic stippling or Howell-Jolly bodies may also be observed (Green, 2016). In people, anemia attributable to a deficiency in cobalamin (vitamin B12) may also be called pernicious anemia. In dogs and cats, megaloblastic erythroid cells may be observed in the bone marrow but may not be observed in blood (Stockham and Scott, 2008b).",

In cases of hypothyroidism, several mechanisms may be contributing to the decreases in red cell mass. Decreased folate or cobalamin concentrations secondary to the hypothyroidism leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, decreased tissue oxygen demand leading to decreased EPO and lower baseline red cell mass, and ACD may contribute to the mild decreases in red cell mass observed with hypothyroidism (Ottesen et al., 1995, Hines et al., 1968, Stockham and Scott, 2008b, Mehmet et al., 2012). Mild decreases in red cell mass without apparent changes in reticulocyte counts have been associated with hypoadrenocorticism. This may be due to a decrease in glucocorticoids, and the loss of the apparent proerythropoietic stimulation of glucocorticoids (Stockham and Scott, 2008b).

However, causality is often difficult to prove, and most associations are limited to low numbers of case reports. One study evaluated reports of PRCA associated with administration of 30 different xenobiotics, but causality was only attributed to treatment with azathioprine, isoniazid, and phenytoin (Thompson and Gales, 1996). PRCA due to the development of anti-EPO antibodies may follow the administration of recombinant EPO in humans (Casadevall et al., 2002) and EPO gene therapy in monkeys (Gao et al., 2004). Administration of recombinant EPO to dogs has also led to the development of anti-EPO antibodies and PRCA (Randolph et al., 2004).",

Most autoantibodies that cause platelet destruction are of the IgG class, although cases with IgM or IgA antiplatelet antibodies have also been reported (Diz-K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckkaya and L\u00f3pez, 2016). Antiplatelet antibodies may directly target platelet antigens, such as the glycoprotein integrin \u03b1II\u03b2\u03b23(GPII\u03b2-III\u03b1) that plays a major role in platelet aggregation (He et al., 1994), antigens exposed or formed on platelet surfaces by infectious agents, or infectious agent-targeted antibodies that cross-react with normally expressed platelet surface antigens or membrane components such as phospholipid (Stockham and Scott, 2008c). Antibody-bound platelets may be phagocytosed and destroyed by splenic, bone marrow, or hepatic macrophages, or may be associated with complement-mediated destruction or stimulation of phagocytosis (Diz-K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckkaya and L\u00f3pez, 2016, Russell, 2010). Production of antiplatelet antibodies may be unassociated with an underlying disease condition (idiopathic or primary) and is usually presumed to be an autoimmune process, or may be secondary to infectious or neoplastic processes (Stockham and Scott, 2008c). In sexually mature G\u00f6ttingen minipigs, spontaneous thrombocytopenic purpura has been described and is believed to be caused immune-mediated platelet destruction (Carrasco et al., 2003). ITP secondary to infectious disease has been reported to occur with various bacterial and viral etiologies, including Helicobacter pylori, many rickettsial diseases, HIV, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B and C viruses (Diz-K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckkaya and L\u00f3pez, 2016, Russell, 2010, Cines et al., 2009). Lymphoproliferative neoplasia is a relatively common cause of ITP, and has been associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia of large granular T-lymphocytes (Cines et al., 2009). Connective tissue diseases such as SLE have also been associated with ITP (Cines et al., 2009).",

Aplastic anemia, which is most commonly caused by immune-mediated mechanisms (Young et al., 2006), is associated with generalized bone marrow hypoplasia involving all hematopoietic lineages, including megakaryocytes. Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura in humans may be inherited or acquired, and acquired forms commonly occur through immune-mediated mechanisms (Diz-K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckkaya and L\u00f3pez, 2016). Inherited or congenital forms cause marked decreases in blood platelet counts with an absence of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. This form is frequently associated with mutations in the TPO receptor gene, MPL, and may progress to aplastic anemia (Germeshausen et al., 2006, Van Den Oudenrijn et al., 2000). Acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura is likely associated with immune-mediated decreases in bone marrow megakaryocytes (Tristano, 2005), and antibodies that bind TPO or the TPO receptor have also been reported to cause acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura (Shiozaki et al., 2000, Katsumata et al., 2003).",

Antiplatelet antibodies may be formed through various mechanisms. Penicillin and some cephalosporins cause platelet destruction through hapten-type or drug-dependent antibody production, while quinidine and some NSAIDS can cause immune-mediated platelet destruction through the formation of antibodies that only bind platelets when the soluble drug is present (Aster and Bougie, 2007). Some drugs that inhibit the platelet glycoprotein \u03b1II\u03b2\u03b23(GPII\u03b2-III\u03b1) may lead to platelet expression of a new antigen due to conformation changes to the glycoprotein complexes that can then be bound by antibodies; such drugs include tirofiban, roxifiban, and eptifibatide (Aster and Bougie, 2007, Aster, 2005). Abciximab has been reported to cause drug-specific antibodies that cause decreases in platelet counts (Aster, 2005). Xenobiotic-induced production of autoantibodies that bind platelets, or drug-independent antibodies, has been attributed to procainamide and gold-based compound administration (Aster and Bougie, 2007). In humans, immune-complex type antibodies are classically associated with heparin therapy, and are due to the interaction of heparin, a platelet granule component, and platelet factor 4 (PF4) (Aster and Bougie, 2007, Visentin and Liu, 2007, Arepally and Ortel, 2006).",
