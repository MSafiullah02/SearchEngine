Although viruses depend on the molecular machineries of their host cells for replication, they also express their own specialized replication enzymes to support the production of new virus particles and the spread of infection. Not only do they have to find ways to exploit the cellular machinery they need to establish infection (while often competing with the interests of the cell) but they also have to deal with elaborate antiviral mechanisms that are triggered immediately upon entry of viral material into the cell. Many of these challenges are met by specialized viral enzymes that hijack or manipulate critical cellular systems, and it is therefore not surprising that the study of viruses has repeatedly led to insights into the biology of the cell itself, since viruses have had to \u201clearn\u201d how the cell works in order to survive.",

            "text": "One of the important cellular machineries that is manipulated by viruses is the ubiquitin (Ub) system. Ubiquitination involves the covalent attachment of the C-terminal Gly76 residue of Ub via an isopeptide bond to the \u03b5-amino group of a Lys residue or the \u03b1-amino group of the N-terminal residue of a protein substrate [1]. Ub is a small, 76-aa protein that is highly conserved, stable, structured, and ubiquitously expressed in virtually all cell types. It adopts a \u03b2-grasp fold, consisting of a mixed \u03b2-sheet structured around a central \u03b1-helix, and harbors a C-terminal diGly motif (Fig. 1A). An exposed hydrophobic patch is centralized around residue Ile44 (frequently referred to as the Ile44 patch) and often facilitates recognition by Ub-binding domains (Fig. 1A) [2], [3]. The process of Ub conjugation to substrates is regulated by the E1, E2, and E3 enzymatic cascade leading to (multi)monoubiquitination or formation of polyUb chains upon the modification of a substrate-attached Ub at its Met1, Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, or Lys63 residue [1], [4], [5]. PolyUb chains can be homogeneous when Ub is attached to the same lysine residue on each Ub in the chain; however, mixed-linkage polyUb chains and branched Ub chains can also be formed [6]. Classically, Lys48-linked chains adopt compact conformations (Fig. 1B) and play an important role in proteasomal degradation, whereas Lys63-linked chains adopt an extended conformation (Fig. 1C) and have been implicated in positively mediating signal transduction [1]. Both types of ubiquitination are involved in regulating the signaling that directs the antiviral innate immune response [7], [8]. Additional Ub-like (UBL) proteins such as SUMO or NEDD8 are structured around a \u03b2-grasp fold and possess a C-terminal diGly motif similar to Ub, which allows for covalent conjugation to substrates by their respective E1, E2, and E3 enzymes [9], [10], [11]. In contrast, the UBL protein interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 (ISG15) is composed of two tandem UBL folds that are connected by a short linker; however, it retains the distinctive diGly motif at its C terminus for attachment to target proteins (Fig. 1D). While ISG15 conjugation has been shown to mediate protection from a number of viruses in mice (reviewed in Refs [12], [13]), its role in antiviral immunity remains poorly understood. Interestingly, human ISG15 deficiencies do not appear to alter susceptibility to viral infections [14], and curiously, soluble ISG15 in fact appears to downregulate IFN signaling [15].",

            "text": "The ubiquitination process is highly dynamic and reversible, allowing cells to regulate signal transduction pathways as a response to different stimuli such as virus infections. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) catalyze the removal of Ub or UBLs from cellular substrates, resulting in either complete deubiquitination or editing/trimming of Ub chains [16]. Around 100 human DUBs can be classified into 5 major families based on their catalytic mechanism and structural features [16], [17]. The majority of DUBs are cysteine proteases, which contain an active-site catalytic dyad composed of a Cys nucleophile and a His base arranged in close proximity. The His appears to activate the Cys nucleophile by lowering the pK\na of the side chain and stabilizing the negatively charged thiolate [16]. Often, a third polar residue is present, which likely helps orient the His residue appropriately to facilitate activation of the nucleophile [16]. The Cys protease DUB families include Ub-specific proteases (USPs), ovarian tumor proteases (OTUs), Ub C-terminal hydrolases, and Machado\u2013Joseph disease proteases, whereas the fifth family of DUBs consisting of JAB1/MPN/MOV34 (JAMM) are metalloproteases. More than half of the human DUBs belong to the USP family and generally cleave all Ub linkage types without a clear preference [18]. This is in contrast to the 16 human OTU DUBs that hydrolyze defined subsets of Ub linkage types [19].",

As viruses are extensively using or dealing with some, if not all, of these processes during infection, it is not surprising that several interactions between viruses and the Ub(-like) system in the context of these kinds of cellular processes have been identified. These interactions have been reviewed from several different perspectives by others [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29].

In the case of viruses, sensing of viral proteins or specific forms of viral nucleic acid will initiate the activation of the innate immune response leading to expression of antiviral molecules, including IFNs, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines [30]. Type-I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) will induce an antiviral state by upregulating the expression of hundreds of ISGSs in infected and neighboring cells to limit virus replication and spread [31]. Furthermore, the adaptive immune system becomes activated, promoting antigen presentation and developing effective T- and B-cell responses that may ultimately result in clearance of the virus. Excessive activation of the innate immune system can, however, cause chronic inflammation and autoimmune disorders [32], and antiviral signaling pathways are therefore strictly regulated. Key mechanisms that trigger and fine-tune these immune responses in eukaryotes are the post-translational phosphorylation and ubiquitination of cellular immune factors, which can alter their interaction, localization, stability, or activity (Fig. 2\n) [7], [8], [33], [34], [35].",

            "text": "The first step of the innate immune response is the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by a large repertoire of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) present on immune and non-immune cells. On the surface, and in endosomal compartments of immune cells, toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role as viral PRRs. Subsequent signaling is directed via MyD88, TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and 4, and receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), ultimately leading to the production of type-I IFNs. Intracytosolic sensors for the detection of viral nucleic acids in virtually all cells are retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors, and viral DNA sensors [cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and IFI16 are the key sensors] [36], [37]. RIG-I-like receptors include RIG-I and melanoma differentiation factor 5 (MDA5), which bind different forms of viral RNA leading to their activation and oligomerization that will induce the interaction with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). MAVS recruits signaling molecules such as E3 ligases of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) protein family to activate kinase complexes. TRAF6 will recruit the TAK complex that will phosphorylate the inhibitor of NF-\u03baB kinase \u03b3 (IKK\u03b3) [also known as NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO)], which in turn will form a complex with IKK\u03b1/\u03b2. This complex will initiate the degradation of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1, which frees NF-\u03baB to promote transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Another protein recruited to MAVS, TRAF3, activates a complex comprising of TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/IKK\u03b5 to phosphorylate IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7. Phosphorylation enables the IRF transcription factors to dimerize and induce the expression of type I IFNs in concert with NF-\u03baB [30], [35]. Secreted IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 will bind to IFN receptors and activate the Janus kinase\u2013signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway, resulting in the transcription of ISGs. ISG-encoded proteins, including ISG15, have antiviral activity by interfering with processes like viral replication or translation [31]. With respect to the detection of DNA viruses, virus-derived cytosolic DNA binds to sensor cGAS, which stimulates the synthesis of cGAMP [38]. cGAMP then activates the stimulator of IFN genes (STING), a membrane-bound protein on the endoplasmic reticulum, which recruits TBK1 and initiates IRF3-mediated transcription of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

I\u03baB\u03b1 is degraded by the proteasome after Lys48-linked Ub chains are conjugated, which enables downstream signaling [40]. Atypical Ub chains also play a role in the activation of the innate immune response since NEMO is a substrate for conjugation by Lys27, Lys29, and linear polyUb chains, and STING can be modified with Lys11 and Lys27 polyUb chains [41], [42]. Besides conjugated Ub, unanchored Ub chains (Lys63- or Lys48-linked) also seem to play a role in the regulation of innate immune signaling by providing a multimeric scaffold for the activation of RIG-I and MDA-5 complexes [43], [44], [45]. In addition, ubiquitination of IRF3 has been observed and implicated in the induction of cellular proapoptotic pathways [46] and in the negative regulation of IFN-\u03b2 signaling [47].",

            "text": "Negative regulation of the innate immune response is achieved by conjugation of Lys48-linked polyUb to degrade signaling factors and thereby dampen the expression of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, actions of E3 ligases that attach different Ub linkage chains can be counteracted by several specific cellular DUBs [7], [48]. CYLD (USP) is able to cleave linear and Lys63-linked Ub chains, and it deubiquitinates RIG-I, TRAFs, and TBK1 [49]. OTUB2 (an OTU domain containing DUB) removes Lys63-linked Ub chains from TRAF3 and TRAF6, as does OTUB1; however, in vitro, this latter enzyme preferentially cleaves Lys48-linked Ub chains [19]. Interference with the Lys63-linked auto-ubiquitination of TRAF3 is performed by DUBA (OTUD5), which interacts with TRAF3 [50]. A20 is a complex regulator since it contains an OTU domain at its N terminus that cleaves Lys63-linked polyUb chains and a C-terminal E3 ligase domain for conjugating Lys48-linked Ub [51], [52]. Deubiquitination of TRAF6 and NEMO by A20 leads to suppression of NF-\u03baB activation. A20 also disrupts the activation of TBK1 complexes containing TRAF3; however, the interference mechanism is unknown [53]. Additionally, A20 can also bind to specific E2 enzymes and induce their degradation as a mechanism to prevent ubiquitination of other proteins [54]. Several more DUBs that play a role in the regulation of the immune response have been identified such as OTU DUBs Cezanne, OTULIN, and UPS DUBs USP3, 13, and 21 [7], [55], [56], [57], [58]. Mutations in genes encoding DUBs involved in negative regulation of innate immune signaling, like CYLD and A20, can lead to the development of diseases including cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, highlighting the importance of DUB-controlled immune signaling [59], [60].",

            "text": "Constant interactions between hosts and pathogens shape both the cellular antiviral system (in order to efficiently eliminate invading pathogens) and the pathogens (that will evolve and adapt to facilitate efficient replication of their genomes) [61]. Particularly viruses with an RNA genome have a high mutation frequency, which is triggered by the lack of proofreading activity in the viral RNA polymerases that drive their replication [62]. As a result, virus populations are genetically diverse, enabling them to rapidly adapt to changing circumstances. This also enables viruses to acquire diverse genes from various sources or evolve viral enzymes to expand their activities [63]. Mechanisms to avoid or delay the activation of the innate immune system are exploited by viruses to manipulate the host cell environment [64], [65]. Modifying Ub signaling to evade the activation of the innate immune response is used by both DNA and RNA viruses, and methods include, for example, blocking activity or hijacking host E3 ligases or DUBs [66]. Another elaborate viral approach is the expression of virus-encoded E3 ligases or DUBs that can suppress the innate immune response but also potentially affect many other Ub-dependent signaling pathways in the host [66], [67], [68]. In this review, we focus on virus-encoded DUBs (listed in Table 1\n) that have been identified in DNA viruses (adeno- and herpesviruses) and RNA viruses (corona-, arteri-, nairo-, picorna-, and tymoviruses), with an emphasis on the structural biology of these viral DUBs (vDUBs) and their (potential) innate immune suppressive mechanisms.",

Upon observing a reduction in Ub-conjugated proteins in AdV-infected cells, Balakirev and coworkers hypothesized that Ad may employ a vDUB to interfere with cellular Ub-dependent processes [74]. Using reversible Ub-based probes, Avp was identified as an AdV DUB capable of cleaving Lys48-linked tetra Ub chains and ISG15, thus providing the first example of a viral protease with deubiquitinating activity [74]. Indeed, the demonstration of Avp DUB activity would be supported by the compatibility of the previously elucidated Avp consensus sequences with the C-terminal LRGG motif of Ub [72]. The study also demonstrated a significant reduction in the cellular levels of ubiquitinated histone H2A in AdV-infected HeLa cells, suggesting a potential ubiquitinated cellular target for Avp.",

The structural complex revealed similarities with the archetypal cysteine protease papain, which contains a \u03b2-sheet \u201cright\u201d (R) and \u03b1-helical \u201cleft\u201d (L) subdomain that pack together to form a cleft that leads toward the active site (Fig. 3B and C) [76]. The Avp active site is composed of residues His54, Glu71, and Cys122, which superpose closely with the catalytic triad of papain (Fig. 3D). A fourth residue, Gln115, is also present and proposed to participate in the formation of the oxyanion hole, which stabilizes the negatively charged tetrahedral intermediates that form during peptide bond hydrolysis. Later studies describing the structure of Avp in the absence of pVIc concluded that pVIc repositions a loop carrying active-site residue His54 to orient the residue toward an optimal geometry for catalysis (Fig. 3A) [77]. The activating peptide pIVc binds Avp by forming a disulfide bridge with the \u03b2-sheet lobe of Avp and forming the sixth strand of the core \u03b2-sheet structure (Fig. 3A).",

Using intein-mediated chemical ligation, Ub derivative substrates were fashioned to contain a thiol-reactive group in place of the C-terminal Gly76 residue, which, when exposed to a catalytically competent DUB, formed a covalent linkage between the Ub-based probe and the active-site thiol of the target enzyme [83]. The resulting adducts could then be immunoprecipitated and identified by mass spectrometry [83], [84]. Using their probes, an Ub-reactive ~ 47-kDa product was identified in lysates of cells infected with HSV-1 [85]. The product was mapped to the N terminus of the HSV-1 gene product expressed from the UL36 open reading frame (ORF) and was subsequently termed UL36USP on the basis of its reactivity with Ub [85]. Interestingly, the UL36 ORF encodes for a 3164-aa tegument protein, and the identification of a 47-kDa HSV-1 gene product clearly indicated the occurrence of a post-translation cleavage event, although the enzyme responsible for this cleavage remains unknown. UL36USP was found to be active toward both Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyUb chains, with a preference for Lys63 linkages [85], [86].",

Wang et al. demonstrated that the ectopic expression of UL36USP decreased Sendai virus-mediated production of IFN-\u03b2, indicating that UL36USP is involved in the modulation of cellular innate immune signaling pathways [88]. To probe the role of UL36USP during an infection, the authors used an HSV-1 bacterial artificial chromosome system to generate recombinant HSV-1 with a catalytically inactive UL36USP (Cys40Ala). Infections with the UL36USP knockout virus resulted in increased production of IFN-\u03b2, while virus containing wild-type UL36USP impaired cellular IFN-\u03b2 production, demonstrating that UL36USP is an IFN antagonist [88]. To further elucidate the role of UL36USP, reporter assays confirmed that UL36USP interfered with IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation at a level between MAVS and TBK1, possibly via deubiquitination of TRAF3, and inhibited the activity of both IRF- and NF-\u03baB-responsive promoters [88]. Later work demonstrated that UL36USP also inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling at a level between IKK and p65 [89]. Consistent with this observation, expression of UL36USP resulted in a reduction in the levels of Ub-conjugated I\u03baB\u03b1 [89].",

Indeed, Schlieker et al. confirmed the DUB activity of the homologs murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) M48USP domain using a fluorogenic Ub substrate [90] and later Lys48- and Lys63-linked diUb and cellular Ub conjugates [91]. Subsequent determination of the crystal structure of the enzyme bound to Ub vinylmethylester offered the first insights into the structure of a herpesvirus DUB (Fig. 4\n) [91]. M48USP shares little overall structural similarity to other cysteine proteases of known structure. It consists of a central \u03b2-sheet sandwiched between two \u03b1-helical domains, and the authors proposed M48USP to be a member of a novel class of DUBs, termed herpesvirus tegument USPs. Importantly, the M48USP\u2013Ub structure revealed how the vDUB recognizes Ub. The C-terminal extension of Ub binds into a cleft formed between the \u03b2-sheet and an \u03b1-helical subdomain of M48USP, and recognition of the hydrophobic Ile44 patch of Ub is facilitated by a unique \u03b2-hairpin extending from an eight-stranded \u03b2-sheet of the M48USP core (Fig. 4).",

Cullins are well-characterized NEDD8 substrates, and CRL activity can be dependent on neddylation [96].

Furthermore, BPLF1 has been implicated in the inhibition of the host innate immune response to viral infection. Saito and coworkers demonstrated that overexpression of BPLF1 reduced the cellular levels of ubiquitinated TRAF6, inhibiting NF-kB activation and promoting viral replication [99], while others have shown BPLF1 to inhibit TLR signaling likely via deubiquitination of downstream signaling components [100]. Besides BPLF1, EBV may express two other proteins with DUB activity, BSLF1 and BXLF1, but further investigation into their relevance is necessary [82].",

            "text": "Homologs of UL36USP with confirmed deubiquitinating activity have been identified in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), murine gammaherpes virus 68 (MHV\u201068), Marek's disease virus (MDV), and Kaposi's sarcoma virus (KSV) [101], [102], [103], [104]. UL48USP and ORF64USP from HCMV and KSV, respectively, were both found to process Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyUb chains in vitro\n[86], [103], and KSV ORF64USP was found to target RIG-I, thereby inhibiting IFN-\u03b2 and NF-kB promoter activity [105]. Recombinant viruses harboring active-site mutations within their respective DUB domains have shed light on the role of herpesvirus DUBs in vivo. KSV virus with an active-site mutation in ORF64USP implicated its DUB activity in the lytic replication cycle [103], while recombinant MDV with a catalytically inactive MDVUSP implicated DUB activity in the maintenance of cellular transformation in vivo\n[104]. Furthermore, an HCMV UL48USP active-site mutant decreased the production of infectious viral progeny during infection [101]. Finally, while the DUB activity of the pseudorabies virus (PrV) pUL36 domain has yet to be confirmed in vitro, infection with a recombinant virus containing a Cys-Ser mutation at the catalytic nucleophile of pUL36 demonstrated delayed neuroinvasion in mice [106]. Further investigation into the role of pUL36 in vivo using quantitative mass spectrometry identified Lys442 as a conserved and critical ubiquitination site on pUL36, with increased modification observed during infection with the catalytically inactive mutant virus [107]. pUL36 was proposed to act as a Ub switch, with ubiquitination/deubiquitination at Lys442 controlling invasive states of PrV, and with pUL36 DUB activity and Lys442 ubiquitination acting as critical factors for neuroinvasion and retrograde axonal transport, respectively [107].",

The absence of a second paralogous PLP domain, combined with an analysis of putative cleavage sites, suggested that PLpro was responsible for cleaving three sites within the SARS-CoV polyprotein and releasing nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 from the viral polyprotein [125]. This activity was soon confirmed experimentally, with PLpro recognizing the consensus site LXGG [126], [127]. Structural modeling of SARS-CoV PLpro based on the crystal structure of the cellular DUB herpesvirus-associated USP (HAUSP) suggested that the viral enzyme adopts a papain-like fold with a circularly permutated C4 zinc finger domain [128]. The structural similarity between PLpro and a cellular DUB, along with the compatibility of the PLpro consensus cleavage sequence with the C-terminal RLRGG motif of Ub, led to the hypothesis that PLpro may possess DUB and possibly ISG15-deconjugating (deISGylating) activity [128].",

Devaraj and coworkers demonstrated that PLpro inhibited RIG-I-, MDA5-, and TLR3-mediated IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity and interfered with signaling components specific to IRF3 activation [131].

            "text": "A crystal structure of SARS CoV PLpro confirmed it to have a domain organization similar to HAUSP, which consists of \u201cthumb\u201d, \u201cpalm\u201d, and \u201cfingers\u201d subdomains that organize together to resemble an extended right hand (Fig. 5A) [135], [136]. The \u03b1-helical thumb and \u03b2-sheet palm domains pack together and host a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad at their interface, with residues adopting a similar geometry to that found in papain, while the fingers domain harbors a circularly permutated C4 zinc finger as had been predicted (Fig. 5A) [128]. Additionally, a tryptophan residue (Trp107) near the active site was found to be oriented such that the indole ring hydrogen was believed to form part of the oxyanion hole (Fig. 5A). Also situated near the active site was a 6-aa loop flanked by glycine residues. This loop is also present in the cellular HAUSP and USP14, where it is termed blocking-loop 2 (BL2; Fig. 5A), as it occludes the active site of USP14 in the absence of Ub and is thus proposed to serve a regulatory function. In PLpro, this loop is found to be in an \u201copen\u201d state, although molecular dynamics simulations predict that the loop samples both \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d conformations [137]. Intriguingly, the N-terminal domain of PLpro adopts a UBL \u03b2-grasp fold, which packs against the thumb domain (Fig. 5A). While little is known regarding the function of this domain, conflicting data have been reported showing that this domain is either required [133] or dispensable [138] for the immunomodulatory activity of PLpro, although the UBL domain does not appear to be necessary with respect to DUB activity [133], [139].",

Crystal structures of PLpro bound to the C-terminal domain of human and mouse ISG15 (mISG15) have also now been reported, demonstrating that species-specific recognition of ISG15 molecules is mediated by unique interactions between PLpro and the respective ISG15s [141].

The Lys48 diUb probe was fashioned with a cysteine-reactive alkyne at the C terminus of the proximal Ub moiety, enabling covalent binding of the molecule to PLpro and interaction of its individual Ub domains associated with S1 and S2 binding sites on the vDUB domain (Fig. 5B) (see Ref. [143] for nomenclature). Consistent with earlier predictions [144], the Lys48 diUb probe bound PLpro in an extended conformation, as opposed to the canonical compact conformation observed with most Lys48-linked Ub chains. Binding of the distal Ub moiety at the S2 site was governed by a number of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues at the surface of an \u03b1-helix within the thumb domain, which associated with the Ile44 patch of Ub (Fig. 5B) [142], [144]. These studies supported earlier observations that Lys48-linked polyUb chains were processed into diUb moieties, and PLpro may recognize Lys48 diUb preferentially [139].",

As expected, the active site is composed of a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad, although interestingly, the oxyanion hole of MERS-CoV PLpro appears deficient. The tryptophan residue proposed to form part of the oxyanion hole in SARS-CoV PLpro is replaced with a leucine, which is unable to participate in stabilizing the oxyanion since its side chain is entirely non-polar. Consistent with this observation, a tryptophan substitution aimed at restoring the MERS-CoV oxyanion hole increased the catalytic activity of PLpro\n[159], [160]. Differences have also been noted in the BL2 loop, which, in the case of SARS-CoV PLpro, was found to interact with small-molecule inhibitors of the enzyme [148], [153]. These SARS-CoV-specific compounds are ineffective toward MERS-CoV PLpro, likely due to structural differences in the BL2 loop and the inability of MERS-CoV PLpro BL2 residues to complete analogous hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with these compounds [164].",

            "text": "The fact that CoV PLpro domains possess two distinct functions, which comprise both DUB and polyprotein cleavage activities, complicates the ability to study these respective functions exclusively, as both activities depend on the same active site. Studying the role of PLpro DUB activity independent of viral polyprotein processing thus necessitates its selective disruption. To achieve this, we determined the crystal structure of PLpro covalently bound to Ub, providing a clear picture of the PLpro\u2013Ub interface (Fig. 5C) [162]. Specifically, mutation Val1691Arg was found to significantly disrupt the interaction between PLpro and the hydrophobic Ile44 patch of Ub by introducing a repulsive charge and steric bulk at a key position on the S1 Ub-binding site of PLpro (Fig. 5C). This mutation, along with others, abrogated DUB activity yet permitted polyprotein cleavage at the nsp2\u20133 junction, thus providing an ideal system to directly assess whether PLpro DUB activity alone disrupts cellular signaling. PLpro inhibited MAVS- and IRF3-mediated IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity, while DUB-deficient PLpro was unable to interfere, implicating the DUB activity of PLpro directly in the evasion of cellular signaling pathways involved in innate immunity [162]. While this immune evasive activity had been previously noted [157], [158], [163], it had not been directly linked to the DUB function of PLpro. Additionally, PLpro has been found to interfere with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [163]. Interestingly, Yang and coworkers observed that PLpro active-site knockout mutants also prevented ubiquitination in cell culture, suggesting a protease-independent inhibition of Ub conjugation, although this has not been confirmed by others [157]. Importantly, selective interference of PLpro DUB activity could enable future engineering of replication-competent, DUB-deficient MERS-CoV that could be used to investigate the role of PLpro DUB activity during MERS-CoV infection.",

PLP2 cleaves the viral polyprotein to release nsp2 and nsp3, although it does not cleave following a diGly motif as found for other CoV PLPs; instead, it has been reported to recognize FTKLAG\u2193GK and VAKQGA\u2193GF sites within the viral polyprotein [172]. Nevertheless, NL63 PLP2 also possesses DUB activity, cleaving Lys48-linked [172] and Lys63-linked polyUb chains [138], and ISG15 [173]. Initial work demonstrated that HCoV-NL63 infection resulted in impaired IFN-\u03b2 secretion in cell culture [138], and subsequent studies investigated the role of PLP2 in downregulating the cellular innate immune response. PLP2 downregulated Sendai virus- and RIG-I-mediated IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity [133], and PolyI:C-induced, TLR3-dependent IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity [138]. Consistent with these observations, PLP2 deubiquitinated RIG-I, TBK1, IRF3, and STING in overexpression experiments [174]. Its role in downregulating TNF-\u03b1-induced, NF-\u03baB-dependent signaling pathways was also suggested [133]. Interestingly, PLP2 also appears to downregulate RIG-I-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production irrespective of its catalytic activity [138].",

The autoproteolytic activity of PLP2 toward the MHV polyprotein was later demonstrated [176], and the cleavage site within the viral polyprotein recognized by PLP2 was determined to be FSLKGG \u2193 AV. DUB activity of MHV PLP2 was predicted based on the conservation of its active-site residues with the SARS-CoV PLpro domain and later confirmed in vitro, displaying efficient activity toward Lys11, Lys48, and Lys63 diUb and human ISG15 [177]. MHV PLP2 was found to inhibit cellular transcription of IFN-\u03b2 via RIG-I, MAVS-, TBK1-, and IRF3-mediated induction pathways [133], [178] and inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation [179]. Further investigation into the mechanism of IRF3-specific inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production suggested that TBK1 and, curiously, IRF3 were directly deubiquitinated by PLP2 [178], [179]. The crystal structure of MHV PLP2 was eventually determined and revealed a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad, with a Gln residue as a putative contributor to the oxyanion hole, in contrast to the Trp residue found in SARS-CoV PLpro\n[135]. Significant structural homology was observed with respect to other CoV PLP2/PLpro domains, with MHV PLP2 adopting the thumb, palm, and fingers domain architecture common to USP DUBs. Interestingly, mutations in the UBL domain adjacent to MHV PLP2 impaired DUB activity and reduced the thermostability of PLP2 [180].",

After several human OTU domain proteins were identified and shown to have DUB activity, the Ub-deconjugation activity of a number of viral OTU domains, including EAV PLP2, was examined [198]. Ectopic expression of the PLP2 domain alone, or full-length EAV nsp2, indeed resulted in decreased global levels of both Ub and ISG15 conjugates in cultured cells. Genuine DUB activity of EAV PLP2 on both Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyUb chains was further confirmed by in vitro assays using purified protein [196]. EAV PLP2 was therefore concluded to have dual activity toward the viral replicase polyproteins and Ub(-like) conjugates. Interestingly, cellular OTU domain-containing DUBs generally seem much less promiscuous, as they do not cleave ISG15 conjugates [198] and are usually at least partly specific for certain Ub linkages [19]. NF-\u03baB activation by TNF-\u03b1 was suppressed upon the expression of EAV PLP2 [198], hinting at an innate immune suppressive function of the vDUB. EAV PLP2 also inhibits RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling upon overexpression and is able to deubiquitinate RIG-I [196].",

Interestingly, PLP2 bound Ub in an orientation comparable to that of a viral OTU domain Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV; see below), with the zinc finger domain performing an analogous role in orienting Ub binding as a \u03b2-hairpin present in the CCHFV OTU domain, which appears to assist in expanding the substrate specificity of PLP2 to include ISG15, as was observed for the CCHFV enzyme [200]. Guided by the structure (Fig. 6), we mutated the Ub-binding surface on PLP2 to prevent Ub binding while leaving the active site of the protease unperturbed [199]. Indeed, recombinant EAV virus containing these mutations displayed wild-type replication kinetics in cell culture infections, confirming that polyprotein processing by PLP2 was unaffected. Primary equine lung fibroblasts were then infected with the DUB-negative viruses and compared to wild-type EAV. Significantly enhanced innate immune responses were measured in the mutant virus infections (by comparing mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b2, MX1, and IL8), which provided direct evidence that vDUB activity supresses host antiviral responses. This opens the possibility of using DUB-negative viruses that display reduced innate immune suppressive activity (with respect to wild-type virus) as next-generation attenuated live virus vaccines. A vaccination challenge trial in horses comparing wild-type and DUB-negative EAV resulted in slightly decreased replication of the DUB-negative virus but comparable clinical disease, antibody response, and innate immune response [201]. It should be noted that under the experimental conditions, no difference was measured between the two viruses, which might be explained by the already high level of protection induced by the wild-type virus [201].",

Probing the nsp2/3 cleavage site revealed that the cleavage site is at the Gly1198 + 1199 dipeptide [202]. Besides full-length nps2, many different isoforms of nsp2 having the same N terminus were detected during infection in cell culture [203]. These likely at least partly account for cleavage products of nsp2 when other conserved Gly dipeptide sites are processed by PLP2. More recently, two nsp2 products were identified as a result of \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 ribosomal frameshifting in the nsp2 region of the polyprotein gene, yielding nsp2 trans frame (TF) and nsp2N products, respectively [204]. Nsp2TF contains a different C-terminal transmembrane domain compared to nsp2 and localized to different intracellular compartments. Removal of nsp2TF attenuated the virus as it replicated slower than wild-type virus and reached lower peak titers [204]. For this frameshift event, the frameshift site, a frameshift-stimulatory element, and, uniquely, a protein factor, nsp1\u03b2, are required [205]. Some of the nsp2 isoforms were found to be present in or on virus particles and might participate in entry, early steps of virus replication, or suppression of host immune responses [206].",

PLP2 inhibited NF-\u03baB activation in overexpression experiments by interfering with the Lys48-linked polyubiquitination of I\u03baB\u03b1 and thereby preventing its degradation [208]. RIG-I was also deubiquitinated upon overexpression of PRRSV PLP2, suggesting that the DUB activity of PLP2 is responsible for evading RIG-I-induced innate immune responses [196]. PLP2 of JXwn06, a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain, and that of a modified live virus vaccine strain, were shown to cleave all diUb chains linked through the different Lys in Ub, but not linear diUb in vitro\n[209]. The greatest difference between these PLP2s was that JXwn06 was more active toward Lys63-linked diUb than modified live virus. In vitro, PLP2 cleaved neither human ISG15-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (ISG15-AMC) nor the pro-forms of human ISG15 or porcine ISG15, which contradicts the earlier observation of ISG15 conjugate cleavage upon ectopic expression of PLP2 [198], [207], [209]. With respect to the different isoforms of PPRSV nsp2 that include PLP2, no studies have been carried out to assess the specific DUB activities of these variants and their functional contribution during infection.",

Expression of the CCHFV OTU domain diminished activity at an NF-\u03baB-responsive promoter during TNF-\u03b1 stimulation and established the CCHFV OTU domain as a viral protease involved in the evasion of the cellular innate immune response. The work culminated with the description of a chimeric Sindbis virus expressing the CCHFV OTU domain along with ISG15, which was found to increase lethality in IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 receptor\u2212/\u2212 background mice, effectively preventing ISG15-mediated protection of Sindbis virus lethality. Following work demonstrated that the CCHFV OTU domain mitigates RIG-I-mediated IFN-\u03b2 expression, suggesting that the enzyme inhibits both antiviral and pro-inflammatory branches of the innate immune response during infection [196].",

Interestingly, the alternate binding orientation of Ub and ISG15 to the CCHFV OTU was due, in part, to the presence of a unique \u03b2-hairpin that forms a substantial part of the substrate binding surface on the viral enzyme (Fig. 7A). The \u03b2-hairpin structure was thus proposed to facilitate a rotated binding orientation for Ub that also accommodated basic residues within the C-terminal \u03b2-grasp domain of ISG15, which appear to prevent its interaction with the yOTU1 [217]. Using structure-guided mutagenesis, the DUB and deISGylating activities of CCHFV OTU could be decoupled by exploiting unique interactions between the OTU domain and its cognate substrates, targeting a helical arm structure conserved in most OTU domains in order to disrupt deISGylating activity and a unique hydrogen bonding interaction occurring at the interface of Ub and the novel \u03b2-hairpin structure of CCHFV OTU [218].",

Furthermore, Akutsu and coworkers saw a marked increase in activity toward a fluorescent Lys63-linked diUb substrate compared to Lys48-linked diUb, providing kinetic evidence for CCHFV OTU linkage specificity [218]. While this demonstrates that CCHFV OTU may be somewhat capable of discriminating between Ub linkage types, structural evidence is necessary to confirm the molecular basis for the observed specificities. Recent advancements in CCHFV reverse genetics systems [222] may also soon enable studies that directly reveal the role of the DUB and deISGylating activities of the OTU domain during CCHFV infection.",

It was also demonstrated that the DUGV OTU was ineffective at processing ISG15, and a description of the DUGV OTU crystal structure in complex with Ub and a comparison with CCHFV OTU suggested that the inability of DUGV OTU to process ISG15 was centralized around residue Thr128, which was unable to form a hydrogen-bonding network with ISG15 comparable to the CCHFV OTU residue Glu128. The introduction of Glu128 to DUGV OTU indeed increased reactivity toward a fluorogenic ISG15 substrate by 2000% [221]. Additional similarities with the CCHFV OTU domain were found in its ability to downregulate cellular immune response pathways, where both NF-\u03baB- and IFN-responsive promoter activities were disabled upon stimulation in the presence of DUGV OTU [223].",

The C-terminal polyprotein cleavage site recognized by Lbpro was present in the crystallized construct and found to occupy the active site of an adjacent Lbpro monomer, mimicking a product-bound complex (Fig. 8\n). While this trans interaction may suggest that Lbpro removal also occurs in trans within the context of polyprotein maturation, the authors proposed that the removal of Lbpro may also occur in cis, due in part to the relatively weak intermolecular contacts between Lbpro monomers and the propensity for the residues within extended C terminus of Lbpro to turn over the protease into the active-site cleft. NMR results, however, show that Lbpro exists as a homodimer in solution [239].",

This was confirmed in vitro, where Lpro cleaved Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyUb chains and globally deubiquitinated cellular proteins during ectopic expression [240]. Based on previous findings that the IFN antagonist and eIF4G processing functions of Lpro were apparently independent [235], Wang and coworkers sought to determine if the DUB and eIF4G processing activities were similarly uncoupled. Indeed, the previously characterized Ile83Ala/Leu86Ala Lpro mutant was deficient in DUB and IFN-supressing activities yet retained the ability to hydrolyze eIFG4, effectively linking the DUB and immunosuppressive properties of Lpro\n[240]. Furthermore, overexpression of Lpro resulted in a reduction of Ub-conjugated RIG-I, TBK1, TRAF3, and TRAF6, providing evidence for the role of Lpro in supressing host Ub-dependent innate immune signaling pathways via deubiquitination of cellular signaling components [240].",

While the autocatalytic activity and substrate specificity of Lpro have been characterized, which have led to the development of peptidomimetic compounds as potential inhibitors of Lpro\n[241], [242], [243], the molecular basis for Ub recognition by Lpro remains to be elucidated. Mutagenesis has been able to discriminate between the DUB activity and polyprotein/eIFG4 processing activities of Lpro; however, it is still unclear how these mutations exert their selective effect. It is interesting to note that Ile83Ala/Leu86Ala mutations targeted the SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS (SAP) domain within Lpro\n[235], and while these mutations selectively abrogate DUB activity [240] and delay nuclear translocation [235], they do not appear to target the likely Ub-binding interface of Lpro, which has been demonstrated to be an effective means to inhibit the DUB activity of other vDUBs [162], [199]. Further adding to the complexity of its role in innate immune suppression, Lpro has been implicated in the degradation of NF-\u03baB, although this activity has not been demonstrated directly [234]. The structural characterization of Lpro in complex with Ub should shed light on some of these questions.",

Further analysis determined that the inserted sequence shared significant similarity with the Torovirus (a member of the order Nidovirales) nsp3-like PLP at the amino acid level, which was subsequently termed ToV-PLP. Homology modeling predicted structural similarities between ToV-PLP and the FMDV Lpro, leading to the hypothesis that ToV-PLP may possess DUB/deISGylating activities. These suspicions were confirmed, with ToV-PLP showing global DUB and deISGylating activity in cell culture and in vitro analysis demonstrating that ToV-PLP processed ISG15, Lys48-, and Lys63-linked polyUb chains and curiously showed activity toward Met1 linear Ub chains [226]. Infection of swine testicular cells with recombinant EVG lacking ToV-PLP increased cellular type I and type II IFN production and ISG15 transcription and displayed impaired growth kinetics compared to its ToV-PLP-containing counterpart [226]. Although Enteroviruses are known to have high rates of genetic recombination, the cross-order acquisition of a novel DUB by EVG is likely a rare event [226], and the apparent increase in viral fitness with respect to DUB-negative EVG further demonstrates the importance of vDUBs in supressing the innate immune response of their hosts.",

Their non-structural proteins are expressed from two overlapping ORFs, ORF-206 and ORF-69 [244], which encode for p206 and p69, respectively. The TYMV PLP (PRO) domain is encoded within ORF-206 and cleaves the translation product, p206, at two sites releasing p98, p42, and p66 [245], [246], [247], [248]. During infection by the virus, the host actively supresses accumulation of the TYMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (POL), located in p66, by tagging it with Lys48-linked polyUb, targeting it to the Ub-proteasome system [249]. Appreciating that the TYMV PRO consensus site (K/R)LX(G/A/S)(G/A/S) [248] was compatible with the C terminus of Ub, Chenon et al. suggested that PRO may counter this cellular defence mechanism by stabilizing the POL domain during infection via removal of the Lys48-Ub chains [250]. Indeed, PRO is able to process Lys48- and Lys63-polyUb chains in vitro, and pulse-chase analysis determined that expression of PRO stabilized p66 in a protease-dependent manner [250].",

The crystal structure of the TYMV PRO domain revealed a compact protease domain, composed of \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-sheet lobes, which hosted the catalytic Cys and His residues, respectively, and a unique N-terminal lobe (Fig. 9\n) [251]. A structural comparison using the DALI alignment server also detected significant structural similarities with previously reported viral and eukaryotic OTU domains, placing the TYMV PRO domain within the OTU superfamily [200]. In general, the active site of PLPs is canopied by a loop structure. The active site of PRO possesses no such loop, making its active site entirely solvent exposed [251]. Also absent was the third residue thought to align the histidine imidazole ring for proper catalysis. Taken together, the pared-down, solvent-exposed active site of PRO was thought to account for its relatively poor DUB activity in comparison to other OTU DUBs and the relaxed specificity of the enzyme at the P1 site [251]. Structural evidence for the in trans cleavage activity of PRO was also revealed, with the C terminus of one PRO domain bound into the cleft leading toward the active site of a nearby symmetry mate (Fig. 9) [251]. Based on this structure, the strict requirements at P5 and P4 were rationalized by the presence of complementary acidic and hydrophobic pockets, respectively, on the surface of PRO [251]. Further in silico docking studies predicted that the N-terminal lobe of PRO interacts with the hydrophobic Ile44 patch of Ub [251].",

            "text": "Significant effort has been dedicated to uncovering the cellular substrates and structural biology of vDUBs, and the role of these enzymes during infection is now beginning to emerge. However, more work is needed is clarify the picture, since many experiments used to ascertain the cellular targets of vDUBs have relied on overexpression experiments and thus may not accurately reflect the circumstances of an actual viral infection. Both the cellular ubiquitination system and viral protein expression are dynamic processes, with the temporal and spatial regulation of these events likely playing a significant role in determining which substrates are accessible to a given vDUB. To complicate matters further, vDUB domains often exist within larger multidomain proteins, some of which are membrane bound, yet they are often studied in isolation as soluble cytoplasmic proteins in cell culture, likely unable to exhibit subcellular localization patterns, which would be found under biologically relevant conditions. Moreover, additional viral factors present during infection may influence the substrate specificity of a vDUB in question. Indeed, emerging technologies are addressing some of the challenges in accurately analyzing Ub-dependent signaling pathways, with powerful mass spectrometry and proteomics methods targeted at probing the dynamics of these systems, including the stoichiometry and kinetics of Ub conjugation, and the specific linkage types populating cellular substrates of interest (reviewed in Ref. [252]). These technologies could now be directed toward revealing the cellular targets and linkage specificities of vDUBs during the course of live virus infection. Furthermore, it is pertinent to recognize that in cases where a viral protease depends on a single active site for both DUB and proteolytic (i.e., non-isopeptide bond cleavage) activity, a complete understanding of their genuine cellular targets necessitates the selective inhibition of DUB activity, as described for a select number of multifunctional vDUBs [162], [199], [240].",

To date, a single example of a vDUB in complex with a diUb substrate has been described [142]; however, exciting new approaches to generate polyUb probes of varying linkage types [253], [254] will now undoubtedly enable rapid advances in understanding the structural basis for the recognition of specific linkage types by vDUBs. The recent characterization of several bacterial DUBs has also advanced our understanding of the interplay between the cellular ubiquitination pathways and pathogenic bacteria at a structural level and highlighted key variable regions within bacterial clan CE proteases permitting adaptation to Ub/Ubl domains and specific Ub linkage types [255].",

While we have made every effort to include all vDUBs that have been described to date, many more undoubtedly remain to be discovered and characterized. Given the growing body of evidence demonstrating the importance of vDUB activity in viral replication and pathogenesis, vDUBs are now recognized as attractive targets for the design of antiviral therapeutics. Small-molecule inhibitors of vDUBs and novel, selective protein-based approaches to disrupt the proteolytic activity of vDUBs are under active investigation, alongside the development of novel live attenuated virus vaccine candidates with impaired DUB activity. Selective targeting of vDUBs by therapeutic intervention or through genetics-based disruption thus holds promising potential for the design of future antivirals and vaccines.",
