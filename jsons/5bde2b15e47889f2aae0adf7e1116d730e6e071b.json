Radiologically confirmed pneumonia was significantly more frequent in children with RSV (39%) than those with influenza (18%) and the clinical course was more severe in RSV than influenza-infected children, especially among infants < 3 months.

In a recent study, the average hospitalization rate attributable to RSV infection has been reported to be 5.2 per 1000 children under 2 years with seasonal variation from 2.5 to 9.9 per 1000 children [3] . Among the same age group, a systematic review has estimated influenza-associated hospitalization rates from 1 to 5 per 1000 children [1] . For both viruses, the highest hospital admission rates were among infants < 3 months with an average rate of 17.9 and 3.3 per 1000 children, respectively, for RSV and influenza [3, 4] . Most studies assessing the influenza and RSV-associated hospitalization burden focus on the entire respiratory viruses season. Little information is available about the role of influenza viruses relative to RSV during periods of high influenza circulation among young children. The aim of this study is to compare the frequency and disease severity of influenza and RSV infections among children < 24 months hospitalized with respiratory symptoms during the peaks of five influenza seasons.",

Peak weeks are defined as consecutive weeks with \u2265 15% of weekly specimens testing positive for influenza as monitored by the provincial sentinel laboratory network. All patients hospitalized for fever/feverishness or cough or sore throat have a nasal specimen collected with a flocked swab. Specimens are tested by the Luminex xTAG \u00ae RVP FAST multiplex, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay which can detect 17 respiratory viruses (RV) [5] . Patients admitted for \u2265 24 h to the hospital floor are invited 1 3 to participate in the study; those who give their informed consent are included. Demographic and clinical information of patients including chronic conditions associated with increased risk of influenza complications is collected using a standardized questionnaire. In our study, patient's chronic conditions information was retrieved by nurses from medical records and we did not ascertain diagnosis criterions of the asthma condition identified through the chart review among the children < 2 years. As it is difficult to diagnose asthma in these young children and confirm it as definite bronchial asthma, we used the term \"asthma-like condition\". Additional details are presented elsewhere [5] . The peak weeks of the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 to 2017-2018 influenza seasons were included in the analysis. The 2013-2014 season was excluded, because only influenza viruses were tested during this season. Proportions were compared with the Chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Continuous variables were compared using Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this study. First, RSV seasonal epidemics overlapped differently with epidemic curves of influenza during the study period. Both adults and children contribute to the Quebec provincial sentinel data for respiratory viral surveillance. It is likely that children disproportionately drive RSV findings in the community and conversely that adults predominate influenza circulation data. Even if RSV and influenza circulation in both adults and children may not coincide exactly with that of children, the overall RSV circulation relative to that of influenza is likely to be reflected in the sentinel surveillance curves we have presented. Second, we defined influenza peak weeks as those during which the percentage of positive specimens tested was \u2265 15% as monitored by the provincial sentinel laboratory network. This definition was based on provincial data indicating that weeks with \u2265 15% of influenza-positive specimens represented more than 74% of total influenza-positive tests during entire influenza season, and this peak week definition was used in line with previously published works [14, 15] . During the peak influenza weeks of the 5 year study period, RSV and influenza had varying degree of seasonal overlap (Fig. 1) . Relatively complete RSV and influenza peak weeks' overlap was evident during the two last seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018), with more than half (56%) of the total of RSV positive tests during the peak influenza included in our study. However, after excluding these two seasons, we found similar results of higher frequency of RSV compared to influenza infections (data not presented). Third, there was no information about RSV risk factors for hospitalization such as history of prematurity, specific comorbidity (cystic fibrosis, neuromuscular diseases, etc.) as our original data focused on depicting the epidemiology of influenza infections. The low frequency of influenza detection is unlikely due to vaccination given the low rate of influenza vaccination among pregnant women (~ 16%) and children < 2 years (17-19%) in Quebec [16, 17] , and little evidence is available on effectiveness of current influenza vaccines for children < 2 years [18]. Finally, influenza antiviral treatment data were not recorded systematically all seasons, preventing us from analyzing its impact on influenza duration of hospitalization.",
