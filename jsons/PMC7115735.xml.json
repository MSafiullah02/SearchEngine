For a disease with such an intriguing epidemiological profile, it was inevitable that there was room for wide speculation. As far as the inhabitants of the endemic villages were concerned, the reason was simple. The sudden misfortune that was laid upon their lives after the end of World War II could not have any other explanation but the interference of supernatural forces, divine or otherwise. It therefore was not unexpected that they tried to calm these forces with rituals and ceremonies and protect themselves by wearing amulets.",

It therefore is not unexpected that one of the first reports of BEN also announced a definitive answer to its pathogenesis, because Serbian investigators considered it to be the result of lead poisoning of the flour in endemic regions.28 Ironically, 50 years later, the precise cause of BEN has not been definitely established.",

The quest for the cause of BEN proved not to be an easy task because of many factors. First, the epidemiological data from the countries where the disease was prevalent were not of perfect quality. Second, collaboration between investigators from these different countries did not take place. As a consequence, results from studies in one country were never confirmed in the others. Third, no matter how fascinating its nature may be, BEN is a rare disorder affecting only some 10,000s of people in confined Balkan villages, with a practical consequence being a lack of funding resources for its study. Finally, political and social events that took place in the troubled region of the Balkan Peninsula had their own negative effect on the efforts to find a solution to the mystery of BEN. One has to keep in mind that the political tensions that followed the end of World War II created a situation in the Balkan area that made a rare nephropathy much more a local disturbance than a national priority.",

            "text": "No matter what the obstacles were, research about the causative factor(s) of BEN started almost immediately after its recognition as a discrete nosological entity. For a disease with such a narrow, defined, and well-preserved geographic distribution, it was a logical assumption that the causative factor should be an environmental one endemic to the afflicted regions. Nonetheless, along with this ecological influence, other factors had to be taken into consideration. For example, an obvious question was how could such an environmental trigger selectively affect certain villages and households and leave the ones just next to them undisturbed? Could these differences be explained by the existence of genetic variability between diseased and healthy families? Or could it be an infectious agent prevalent to the inflicted foci? Another pivotal question related to the long incubation period of the disease, which pointed to a long exposure to a low-dose harming agent that existed in the environment for many years. If that is the case, why then did BEN appear only during the second half of the century in the endemic areas and not before? Such a temporal association requires a major local environmental change before the first appearance of the disease, and such an alteration is not easy to identify in the history of the region. In addition, any etiologic hypothesis should take into consideration not only the nephropathy itself, but also the increased incidence of upper urothelial neoplasms in the patients. Finally, if somebody were to solve the mystery of BEN, he or she should use information from both animal models of interstitial nephropathy and the recognized effects of the candidate environmental factors in human health and disease. Given all these varied questions, it is not surprising that throughout the years, the effort to solve the riddle of BEN involved not only nephrologists, but also scientists from such diverse fields as occupational medicine, animal models of human disease, environmental sciences and epidemiology, oncology, genetics, and geology.",

Akhmeteli and then Krogh proposed that BEN was the result of contamination of the food chain in endemic areas by ochratoxin A (OTA),29 a toxic product of molds that belong to the Aspergillus or Penicillium fungal genera. This \u201cmycotoxin\u201d theory was built around the remarkable similarity between BEN and porcine nephropathy.30 The latter has a similar confined geographic distribution because it mainly occurs in Northern Europe and shares many pathological characteristics with BEN. Porcine nephropathy is caused by OTA, raising the possibility for a similar connection between BEN and mycotoxins. Therefore, an effort to provide evidence for such an association was started.",

In addition, there should be evidence regarding how the offending agent moves from the environmental source to the human organism. Moreover, topographical specificity should exist, meaning that the agent must be more prevalent in endemic compared with nonendemic regions.

Nonetheless, it was shown in the same studies that the variation in OTA values within the affected population was very high and often overlapped greatly with values from nonendemic areas of the world. Moreover, there was no constant association between consumption of OTA and its levels in serum or urine.",

The evidence for the role of OTA as the causative factor for BEN was critically reviewed in a recent international symposium held in Zagreb.42 A series of arguments against such a role were presented; the strongest were the uneven geographic distribution of food contamination with OTA and BEN and the lack of definitive proof for OTA-DNA adduct formation.",

            "text": "A different pathogenetic hypothesis was proposed by Kazantzis43 in 1967 during the conference on BEN organized by the CIBA Foundation. He claimed that contamination of the baking flour in endemic areas by seeds of the birthwort Aristolochia clematitis was causing the disease (Fig 3). Apparently, a toxic constituent was contained in the seeds of the plant and induced the renal damage. The initial exploration of this theory is attributed to Ivi\u0107,44 who analyzed available data and performed field and laboratory studies to provide a well-documented hypothesis on the pathogenesis of BEN. Again, animal studies set the background. Ivi\u0107 was aware of publications of such Croatian scientists as Dumic45 and Martincic46 reporting that horses consuming hay that contained seeds of A clematitis experienced renal disease with proteinuria. More strikingly, when kidneys from these horses were examined histologically, they showed tubulointerstitial damage with minimal inflammation, a picture that was analogous to BEN.45, 46 To prove his hypothesis, Ivi\u0107 performed field studies and observed that seeds from A clematitis were interspersed among wheat grains during the harvest. The local villagers did not make an effort to remove the contaminants during flour preparation. Because bread is the major constituent of the local diet, contamination of the wheat with even a few seeds of A clematitis could result in low-dose long-term intoxication with the offending agent. Continuing his sound scientific approach, Ivi\u0107 went on and fed rabbits with flour prepared from A clematitis seeds. The rabbits developed nephropathy, which, at the histological level, resembled the findings of BEN. Ivi\u0107 even proved the carcinogenetic potential of the plant because rats developed sarcomas at the site of injection of aqueous extracts of A clematitis.47 It is surprising that Ivi\u0107's thorough approach and well-documented results failed to attract more interest from the scientific community until many years later.",

The regimen contained 2 Chinese herbs, and it eventually was proved that it was contaminated with aristolochic acid, a main toxic product of Aristolochia species. Its presence in the slimming regimen was the result of accidental substitution of the prescribed herb Stephania tetrandra (\u2018Han Fang-ji') by Aristolochia fangchi (\u2018Guang Fang-ji'). Therefore, the name of the Belgian disorder changed to Chinese herb nephropathy, or aristolochic acid nephropathy. It was soon realized that this disease had many similarities to BEN, especially in the morphological characteristics, which were almost identical in the 2 conditions. This similarity suggested that the same factor, ie, aristolochic acid, could be responsible for both conditions.49 This association was supported further by the development of renal failure in Japanese patients receiving an aristolochic acid\u2013containing remedy for atopic dermatitis.50 Interestingly, upper urothelial neoplasms also developed in some patients with Chinese herb nephropathy.51, 52\n",

            "text": "These intriguing reports renewed scientific interest and stimulated new research that resulted in strong evidence supporting a dominant role for aristolochic acid in the pathogenesis of BEN. After its metabolic activation, aristolochic acid reacts with DNA to generate covalent aristolactam-DNA adducts. Some forms of these adducts are stable and can be detected in the affected tissues. Therefore, if aristolochic acid were to blame for BEN, renal tissue from these patients should contain such adducts. Arlt et al53 were the first to prove that this hypothesis is correct by detecting aristolochic acid\u2013specific adducts in all urinary tract tissues from patients with BEN that they examined. Conversely, OTA-specific adducts were detected with much lower density and in only some of the examined tissues. Recently, work by Grollman et al42, 54 expanded these results by showing that aristolochic acid\u2013specific adducts were present in the renal cortex of 5 patients with BEN from an endemic region in Croatia, but not in 5 patients with other forms of chronic renal disease or 5 patients with upper urinary tract transitional cell cancer living in a nonendemic area of Croatia. In addition, when a p53 mutational spectra analysis was performed in urothelial cancer specimens from patients living in endemic foci, a \u201csignature\u201d mutation (A:T\u2192T:A) was detected. Interestingly, this molecular mark is also induced by aristolochic acid in animal models of carcinogenesis and was observed in one patient with aristolochic acid nephropathy and ureteral tumor.42 Therefore, aristolochic acid appears to be responsible not only for the development of renal injury, but also for the high incidence of urothelial cancer in patients with BEN. A recent publication by Lemy et al55 provides convincing evidence for the carcinogenic potential of aristolochic acid. This was a case series in Belgian patients undergoing renal transplantation for end-stage renal failure caused by slimming pill\u2013related aristolochic acid nephropathy. In the pathological examination of the resected specimens, upper-tract urothelial carcinoma was diagnosed in 45% of patients. More interestingly, on long-term follow-up, there was a 40% incidence of bladder carcinoma. It was concluded from this study that the pathogenic properties of aristolochic acid exist for a long time after cessation of exposure.",

However, a critical question still is unanswered; why do only 2% to 5% of the residents in an endemic area develop the disease?22 This cannot be attributed easily to preferential exposure of such a small minority of the population to aristolochic acid, but it could result from genetic polymorphisms. Nevertheless, if the aristolochic acid hypothesis is true, the most important clinical conclusion is that BEN is preventable with simple measures. One can safely predict that contamination of the flour with A clematitis seeds has already been eliminated as a result of the changing ways of life and work in the endemic areas.56 The widespread use of herbicides and use of new harvesting techniques has led to decreased growth of A clematitis in the harvesting fields. Nowadays, fewer and fewer families bake their own bread, rendering the making of contaminated flour highly improbable. If this hypothesis proves to be true, we can be optimistic that a decrease in the incidence of BEN should be expected in the years ahead.",

All endemic areas are in close vicinity to low rank coals. The lignite theory claims that toxic organic substances from these coals leak into groundwater and are transported to the wells that exist in the alluvial valleys, below the lignite deposits.59 This was shown to be true because studies reported greater concentrations of these organic compounds in the water from wells in the endemic areas compared with those in nonendemic ones.60 The final link in the exposure chain is that people in the villages use water from their wells for drinking and cooking purposes.22, 61, 62 In line with this, settlements where most inhabitants use the same limited number of wells show hyperendemicity for BEN. The presence of small concentrations of organic toxic products in the water of the wells is compatible with a slow low-level, but relentless, poisoning of the villagers, a concept that fits very well with the natural history of BEN. The increased incidence of urothelial cancers also can be explained by this theory because these toxic organics are well-known carcinogenic factors. Maybe the most impressive application of the lignite hypothesis is that it may be used as a predictive model.22 An area in Serbia that was not known to be endemic was proved to be such after it was recognized to lay close to a low rank coal field. Research on the role of the Pliocene lignites in the pathogenesis of BEN required a lot of field studies and thus it was abruptly interrupted when the war broke out in Yugoslavia in 1993.63\n",

They were able to detect a novel virus, named the EBN virus, that was present in BEN-derived epithelial cell cultures, but from none of the control cultures. It was proposed that the microorganism was a novel coronavirus based on its cross-reactivity with human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, as well as a pig coronavirus known as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV).64 When seroreactivity to antigens from the new coronavirus was tested, it was shown to be very high in patients with BEN on dialysis therapy (87% by neutralization activity and 95% by immunofluorescent assay, respectively) and controls from endemic areas (74% and 80%), but not in controls from nonendemic regions (13.5% and 60.5%). Nonetheless, the coronavirus theory was put in dispute when Vero cells infected with EBN virus were tested further with various methods, including electron microscopy studies.65 No similarities between EBN virus and coronaviruses were observed in that study.",

After studying 4,077 patients from 417 BEN-affected families, Toncheva et al66 were led to the conclusion that all patients with BEN belong to certain families. Even residents of nonendemic foci who were found to have BEN were identified to be members of BEN families and to have moved from their birthplaces. In addition, BEN shows some epidemiological characteristics typical of genetic disorders. For example, the proportion of sick offspring increases according to the number of parents affected. Accordingly, the risk of developing the disease is much greater in first-degree than second-degree relatives and decreases substantially in remote relatives.66 To further elaborate the genetic component of BEN, cytogenetic studies were performed by the same group of scientists. They proposed that a specific BEN-associated locus exists in 3q25 combined with instability of the long arm of chromosome 3.67, 68 Interestingly, this alteration in 3q25 may also determine the genetic susceptibility for the development of the disease in relatives of patients with BEN.69 Additional data generated from the same group link the increased prevalence of urothelial neoplasms that occurs in patients with BEN to genetically determined aberrations in oncogenesis. Patients with BEN were tested for chromosomal aberrations induced by X-rays or folic acid deprivation.70 There was increased frequency of the aforementioned abnormality in 3q25, but also in 3 other areas that all contain oncogenes, namely c-src (CSK,1q36), raf-1 (RAF1, 3p25), and myb (MYB, 6q23).",

BEN is definitely not a genetic disorder in that it does not follow a pattern of Mendelian inheritance. Conversely, BEN clusters in familial foci, indicating exposure to a common environmental offense. Nevertheless, it is difficult to appreciate which environmental agent could be so selective as to affect only a small minority of closely residing individuals. In regard to that question, one needs to consider the possibility of BEN-like diseases existing in other parts of the world.

            "text": "As the case is for most human diseases, it is likely that BEN is a multifactorial disorder. An environmental factor probably is superimposed on a certain genetic background to create the phenotype of the disease. A triggering agent must exist in the environment in sufficient quantity and with an available exposure route that allows it to be introduced to the human host. There should be a defined population focus isolated enough to render exposure to the agent to be universal in that population and constant. There should be stability of the population at risk, so that individuals are exposed for a long period and an average lifespan that should far exceed 50 years of age, allowing for the long incubation time of the disease. Finally, there should be a health care system with the ability for proper establishment of the diagnosis. It therefore is possible that the combination of all these prerequisites in the post\u2013World War II Balkans resulted in the identification of BEN. From this perspective, it can be said that BEN represents a unique geophysical experiment in which all the components must meld for the disease to develop. The optimistic view from that perspective is that only one of these factors needs to be eliminated for the disease to disappear. We speculate that certain changes in the lifestyle of the people, agricultural practices, or dietary habits may remove one or more cofactor(s) for the development of BEN. Such a scenario eventually would eliminate the burden of this unfortunate condition from the Balkans.",
