            "text": "Intra-alveolar and -vascular fibrin deposition is common in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1,2]. The up-regulation of procoagulant pathways, impairment of physiological anticoagulant systems, and depression of the fibrinolytic pathway, collectively lead to florid alveolar fibrin deposition [3]. Fibrin deposits, in turn, enhance the inflammatory response by increasing vascular permeability, and by activating neutrophils and endothelial cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines [2, 3]. These processes are the hallmarks of ALI/ARDS and contribute to its pathogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that progressive ALI/ARDS is closely linked to the activation of inflammation and coagulation [3, 4], and that protease-activated receptors (PARs) are important candidates in this interaction [5].",

In addition, we were able to observe increased levels of PARs protein, and to co-localize PAR-1 and procoagulant molecules in the alveolar epithelium and vascular endothelium.

At this dose, LPS induces lung injury, as well as the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Groups of animals (n = 17) were killed using Sodium Pentobarbital (150 mg/kg bw, i.p.) at different time-points after LPS administration (1, 3, 6, and 10 h). The control group received an equal volume of sterile saline (2 ml/body), without LPS. At the indicated time, the blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture for blood gas analysis, and lung tissue specimens were harvested with care, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For paraffin sections, lung tissue specimens were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and then embedded in paraffin.

TNF is known to induce the expression of tissue factor, which leads to the activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, and increases in levels of FXa and thrombin, and ultimately, enhancement of coagulation [18]. TNF is also known to increase levels of PAI-1, which, in turn, inhibit fibrinolysis [18]. Following increase in TNF levels, we found a marked elevation of fibrin/fibrinogen protein levels in the lung tissues. This observation was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis that demonstrated clear fibrin deposition in both intra-vascular and -alveolar spaces. Although, in the present study, we did not measure levels of tissue factor or the PAI-1, in our previous investigation these molecules were highly expressed in the lung of LPS-treated rats, as revealed by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses [10]. Collectively, these data suggest that enhanced inflammation, coagulation activation, and the inhibition of fibrinolysis lead to fibrin deposition in acutely injured lung, following LPS administration. These results are consistent with the clinical and experimental evidence for ALI and ARDS [1\u20134].",

The parallel changes observed in levels of both protein and mRNA of PAR isoforms suggests that LPS may exert its influence at the transcription level. The disparity in the timing of PARs expression between our previous and the present studies may be due to species differences [10]. Indeed, Nysted et al. [19] demonstrated that stimulation with the cytokines TNF and interleukin-1 (IL-1), as well as bacterial LPS resulted in a five to ten fold elevation of PAR-2 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner using HUVEC. In addition, the exogenous treatment of human skeletal muscle cell and monocyte with proinflammatory cytokines increased expression of PAR-1 and -2 [20, 21]. Lan et al. [22] demonstrated that inflammatory stimuli induced by influenza A virus expressed PAR-1, -2, -3, and -4 mRNA in the lung of intact mice. It is interesting to note that the occurrence of peak levels for plasma and lung TNF (1 h after LPS administration), coincided with the point at which significant elevations of PARs-1,-2, and-3 were observed, compared to control. These results suggest that TNF, together with, or as well as, LPS rapidly induce expression of PARs gene expression through transcription factors in the injured rat lungs.",

The NF-kB activators include an extensive list of gram-positive and -negative bacteriae and their products such as LPS; viruses and their components; protozoan parasites; cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-1); free radical; and oxidants. Although determination of factors likely to regulate the transcription of PARs is important, it goes beyond the aims of the present study. We believe that NF-kB may be one of the most important transcriptional factors regulating PARs expression in LPS-induced ALI and, as such, plan study it in our future projects.",

PAR-1 and -2 are also present in the terminal bronchial epithelium and Type II epithelial cells of the peripheral lung, and lung macrophages, mast cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes [24]. While our previous study demonstrated the immunolocalization of PAR-1 in these cells and tissues in LPS-treated rabbits, the present study showed strong immunoreactivities for all isoforms of PARs in the endothelium, alveolar epithelium, and lung macrophages using a rat model of ALI [10]. In addition to increased immunoreactivities of tissue factor and PAI-1 in the endothelium and alveolar epithelium, as reported in the previous study, we also confirmed here a strong fibrin deposition in the alveolar epithelium, and intra-alveolar and -vascular spaces. Both the endothelium and alveolar epithelium are known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of ALI. The co-localization of the key procoagulant molecules and the four isoforms of PAR in these tissues imply that these molecules may also play a pivotal role in inducing permeability in endothelial and epithelial cells, as observed in LPS-induced ALI.",

It has been suggested that, in certain instances, binding of protease to one receptor can facilitate cleavage of another receptor. This appears to be the case for PAR-3 and -4 on mouse platelets [25]. Other studies suggest that PAR-3 facilitates activation of PAR-4 in the presence of low thrombin concentration [25, 26]. Some data indicate that PAR-3 is a cofactor for PAR-4 in mouse platelets: the hirudin-like site of PAR-3 binds and concentrates thrombin at the cell surface, and, thereby, promote cleavage of thrombin to PAR-4 [26]. While the pathological significance of these phenomena has not been elucidated, the co-localization and co-expression of PAR3 and -4, as observed in the present study, may indicate a similar cofactor relationship.",

Vogel et al. [28] demonstrated abrogation of thrombin-induced increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability in PAR-1 knockout mice. Furthermore, the absence of PAR-1 signaling appears to attenuate bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis [29]. Indeed, using PAR-2 knockout mouse, Su et al. [30] demonstrated that PAR-2 activation induces lung inflammation and pulmonary edema. In addition to these studies, we found expression of PAR-1 and -2 and their localization in endothelium, alveolar epithelium and macrophages in the lung. Taken together, these data suggest that PAR-1 and -2 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALI. However, the physiological and or pathological significance of PAR-3 and -4 expressions in the injured lung is currently unclear.",

Thus, the current investigation could not provide insights on PARs expression patterns associated with severe endotoxemia. For this reason, future studies should investigate a possible correlation between the degree of severity of induced endotoxemia and the pattern of PARs expression. In addition, a more extended and prolonged time course study should be undertaken that will enable examination of the pulmonary PARs expression possible.",

They were also localized in diverse cells, including vascular endothelium, alveolar epithelium, and alveolar macrophages, a similar localization pattern as tissue factor and PAI-1, observed in our previous study. In addition, we also found TNF expression, as well as intra-alveolar and -vascular fibrin deposition in the lung.
