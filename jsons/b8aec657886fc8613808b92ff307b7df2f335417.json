In this research commentary, we survey the current state of things and propose some directions for research. We first describe the industries, products, and services currently embracing the sharing paradigm, the technology platforms enabling it, the business models driving it, and the regulatory issues. We envisage that promising areas of research should include: 1) devising more efficient algorithms; 2) considering ecological and pro-social objective functions; 3) dealing with regulatory issues; 4) expanding the span of research to cover more geographical areas and a wider set of services; 5) supporting services with more reliable reputation and recommendation systems.",

Meanwhile, the global sharing economy platform revenues has been estimated to go from USD 18.6 billion in 2017 to USD 40.2 billion in 2022 (Mazareanu, 2019b) , a more than doubling of the total as the industry builds global infrastructure. Currently, there are relatively few publicly-traded sharing economy firms, and the market has not been favorable of late for initial public offerings of their stock, though expectations of future market capitalizations are still fairly high among risk-loving investors (though possibly unfounded). 1 For example, February 2020 (just prior to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and its negative impacts on global financial markets), Uber had a market capitalization of USD 71 billion but fell it to USD 37 billion by late March, while GrubHub (a food delivery service) was worth USD 5.35 billion but dropped to USD 2.92 billion also by late March.",

Even though Airbnb has not obtained equity funding or a true financial market capitalization, its private equity firm valuation in 2019 was USD 38 billion based on six million listings in 100,000 cities around the world (Lock, 2019 ). 2 Similar to Priceline's higher valuation in the past than its owner, Airline firm Delta (Schaal, 2020) , Airbnb managed to achieve high market worth than the worlds' fourth largest hotel chain, Marriott, in February 2019 (Zvolska 2019) .",

They include: Acquier et al. (2019) , who crafted a framework with four different forms of sharing economy firms. Shared infrastructure providers create value by providing monetized, temporary access to a centralized pool of proprietary resources that fee-paying people and business customers can access for a fee. In contrast to shared infrastructure providers, 1 Among leading sharing economy firms, Airbnb, Grab Taxi and Didi Chuxing are all privately-held, and only WeWork among these leading firms attempted to have an IPO in 2019, but it failed due to disagreements on the company's market valuation (Aydin, 2019) . 2 In addition, in March 2019 Airbnb employees traded their common stock to HotelProvider, which it purchased in an equity-for-ownership stock purchase valued at USD 35 billion, which is similar to a similar move that Airbnb made to raise private capital in 2016 with an implied firm value of USD 26 billion (Schleifer, 2019) .",

A second concern is problematic patterns of over-consumption of non-sustainable resources due price declines and market-wide information sharing via social media; 4 Next is the extraordinary market power of near-monopoly digital sharing economy platforms that have obtained large global market shares in a short time. Further, there is a more limited potential for community sharing sites to grow and succeed due to their lack of capital, technical capabilities, and technology access. And finally, there is also a widespread and growing awareness of contested openness and access, as well as problematic distinction effects, from potential participants' social connections, and their race and class, ethnicity and education. Problems with social bonding and perceived fairness seem to be occurring for various platforms, in spite of the related intermediary's promises to promote sharing economy values. This is happening due to ineffective internal oversight and the typical \"tragedies of a commons\" issues (Hardin, 1968) .",

So, this is not just selling and distribution, but also the co-creation of products and services (Somers and Baelus, 2018) , new forms of distribution (like no hosts or renters to meet for Airbnb renters or bicycle sharing), This Research Commentary will provide insights in five important issue areas related to the 3 Belk (2014a) has noted that quite a few firms that operate \"sharing platforms\" for communities don't actually \"sharing\" in a strict sense. They include longer-term renting and leasing firms (for cars, vacation houses, etc.); short-term rentals and hires (again, for cars locally, but also paying a fee for baby-sitting help) as opposed to pure exchange without compensation; data sharing based on the acquisition of a user's private preference information, and websites that support P2P bartering. 4 This phenomenon is referred to as the Jevons effect, which reflects how lower prices and increased consumer access to limited-supply resources can result in over-use and inappropriate exploitation. This can damage ecosystems, harm threatened species of wildlife, and diminish the value of unprotected spaces. One examples of this includes the Indonesian government's April 2019 decision to close Komodo Island from January to December 2020 due to excess tourism and declining habitat quality for its endangered species of large Komodo dragon lizards. Though this decision was later rolled back in October 2019, other countries closed and adjusted access to key tourism destinations due to their over-use and concerns about environmental impacts. Two examples are Denmark's Faroe Islands, which has instituted new fees and land use restrictions for hiking, as well as Thailand's uninhabited Phi Phi Leh Island, which closed a beach on Maya Bay that has been damaged by over-use.",

It is true that the presence of a library may reduce the demand for purchases of books, but because there are many readers who benefit from a library's purchase of a book, the price the library is willing to pay will generally exceed the price that individual users would be willing to pay. 5 For other valuable background, the reader should refer to Belk 6 Another facet is value co-creation, involving consumers who help the sharing platform intermediary to enforce rules that maintain order with asset sharing (like for bicycles) via user trust and reciprocity (Lan et al., 2017) , ethical participation of consumers (Nadeem et al., 2020) , and intention to continue to use the same sharing service (Shao et al., 2020) .",

(2020, p. 4 ) explored another important aspect of the sharing economy that provides a context for asserting fundamental theory on owning, using and renting durable goods. They offer the following theoretical interpretation for how ownership, rental and sharing seem to work: \"Although goods are durable, they are eventually used up and have to be replaced. In the presence of the P2P rental option, owners can make a different choice and become renters, and non-owners may decide to buy. \u2026 We find that if the short-run rental rate is below the purchase price, then ownership becomes less attractive and decreases in the long-run relative to the shortrun, and vice versa. This result also offers an intuitive test for whether total ownership will decrease in the long-run. Ownership adjusts so that the long-run rental rate equals the purchase price. As a result, owners and renters receive the same utility at the margin, thereby decoupling individual preferences from ownership. \u2026 While ownership may increase or decrease in the long-run, the option of renting out an owned good makes ownership more valuable. As such, a P2P rental market can have a market-expanding effect, in the sense that it allows a previously infeasible product market to emerge. The reason is that the rental option can generate positive purchase demand at a price that exceeds all consumers' pre-'sharing' valuations.\"",

Another effect occurs with respect to the firm that produces the durable good. It will benefit in terms of profitability by enhancing the quality of a durable good that it sells to make it more attractive for the sharing market, and to diminish its own costs of maintenance in sharing uses. Weber (2016) used an overlapping generations model to analyze sharing economy product pricing and consumer choices with respect to durable goods purchase versus rental, involving owners who are willing to share them. He focused on the demand for ownership, product price patterns, and the participants' payoffs in terms of consumer surplus, profits, and social welfare. He showed how retailers and manufacturers can potentially gain when a sharing platform creates a secondary market for goods. An important finding is that a sharing market can result in increased prices for new products, but this depends on a retailer's willingness to commit to after-market support for product sharing. In addition, higher-cost products tend to have proportionately lower prices, while lower-cost products are unattractive for the producer / manufacturer and intermediary to share. His modeling results show that a second market for product sharing beneficially increases consumer surplus and social welfare, which makes collaborative consumption worthwhile to promote in government policy terms.",

Weber (2014) developed theory that suggests such platform intermediaries can neutralize the financial value impacts of sharing practices on firms that finance the purchase of durable goods by offering insurance for a fee, when the durable goods are vertically differentiated in their quality levels, and renters are observed to take different levels of care with the shared asset. In a model of that involves the consumer's choice between collaborative housing and staying at a nearby hotel, the intermediary is shown to be able to extract gains that the hosts would gain in comparison to direct host-to-renter transactions. The author further shows that sharing that is handled by an intermediary is economically sustainable, when the host sets its own fee and the sharing platform decides on the price for renter's insurance.",

With these things in mind, we propose: (1) What is the purpose of the research directions that are proposed? (2) Do they address real problems at, or beyond the current state of research and practice knowledge? (3) What is new and why will the proposed research matter? (4) Who will care? If the research agenda succeeds, how will the new knowledge that's generated make a difference? (5) Are some stakeholders more important than others? (6) Will the proposed direction of work result in new scientific, practical or policy knowledge for the context -or both? (7) And, can the work be done in a time-frame that is relevant for informing industry, government, and research organizations about issues? 7 The purpose of the research questions that we will lay out is to create a future basis for understanding primary issues in the sharing economy through the interdisciplinary Technology, Social Science, Economics and Policy perspectives.

Of key importance, Magretta (2002, p. further argued, is a competitive strategy which \"explains how you will do better than your rivals. And doing better, by definition, means being different. Organizations achieve superior performance when they are unique, when they do something no other business does in ways that no other business can duplicate.\"",

All it really meant was how you planned to make money.\" This is especially true in light of the \"realities on the ground,\" such as customer acceptance of the psychology of renting and sharing but not owning, the inevitable problems along the way with identity building and competitors, getting the pricing model to work, and creating a social media following through which to target sales.",

A possible explanation for that is due to Gansky (2010) , who considered two dimensions that determine the chance of success of a peer-topeer rental platform: the product cost as a proxy for its value and its frequency of use. High-value, low-use products are the most likely to be shared, since their owners do not need them all the time and require a large incentive to share them. On the opposite side are those products that have low value and are used extensively. We next examine the industries where sharing practices have emerged and see how they fit into this scheme.",

They also reported that under a variety of different market scenarios, the average waiting time for customers is an increasing functionthe of the average search time that drivers face to find riders.

They include, for example (among others): employee, customer, partner / supplier, competitor and public innovations (Morgan, 2017 (Morgan, -2018 , as well as sustaining, incremental, disruptive and radical innovation (Christensen and Raynor, 2003) .",

In all mobility-related sharing contexts (e.g., ride-sharing, delivery scheduling), the need to have a response in real time cannot be minimized. Sharing platforms are able to cope with the array of tasks involved in match-making and pricing if their computational power is sufficiently large and their algorithms sufficiently fast to cope with the large size of the problems, due especially to the number of participants in the sharing scheme (Marr et al., 2016) .

It views value as being created through economies of scope in demand, and the platform serves as a mechanism for coordinating transactions among buyers, with the overall empirical setting framed in terms of information and communications technology (ICT), an industry-level view. In contrast, the Engineering Design perspective views a sharing platform as a technological architecture from a supply perspective. The focus is on innovation and value is created through economies of scope in supply and innovation, while platforms coordinates interactions among innovators, and the primary settings for research are manufacturing and ICT operations. Another more psychological perspective on sharing economy participants is offered by Hellwig et al. (2016) , who distinguished among four psychological types of participants: idealists with high reciprocity and high motivation; opponents with lower motivation who do the least sharing; pragmatists with average sharing behavior, the lowest degree of generosity and reciprocity, and no sense of financial duty to share; and normatives with average sharing behavior but high generosity and reciprocity.

The latter issue will grow in importance as users are allowed to enter more constraints (e.g., their preferences for service providers or the specific features of the sharing service they wish to consume).",

In traditional retail market settings in Western nations, prices were set by the seller, and the consumer would decide whether and when to buy. In many retail markets in Eastern countries, sellers and consumer haggle to reach an agreed-upon pricing. For stated retail prices to work, they typically need to be externally regulated to some extent (by the market, and also possibly more informally yet effectively, by a seller's emphasis on good reputation and fair prices). This helps to diminish the likelihood of price-gouging and charging uninformed consumers inappropriately high prices.",

The platform is the one to accept the booking at a stated price, so it's a matter again of \"whether and when\" the consumer decides to make a purchase. In comparison, the price-setting mechanism may also permit the platform or driver to set prices to flexibility set prices based in awareness of local demand and supply. It is interesting to note that, in other cases such as mobility services, there is wide variation in prices in spite of the heavy government regulation in the telecom market.

This has also become a weapon that traditional companies adopt to stave off the competitive threats from rapidly-growing sharing economy start-ups. We next offer an overview of the regulatory issues that have been raised and how they are likely to impact the sharing economy. Acevedo (2016) defined several different regulatory responses in the sharing economy related to renters, swappers and platforms, for which the time, place, manner and purpose of sharing economy consumption have changed compared to traditional e-commerce. She notes that the primary issues and regulatory concerns of platforms involve the nature of supplier participation and the extent to which the platform substitutes for the role of the government to ensure that suppliers are subject to \"implied regulated\" based on the intermediaries expectations of service quality and the relational and transactional processes. When \"things go wrong\" (e.g., ineffective vetting of suppliers' identities and service demeanor, and problems arise, the author suggested that the spate of court cases points to the need for the government to act with respect to the sharing platforms' lack of satisfactory remedies.",

Additional impetus for this is that suppliers are especially vulnerable and less well protected, since sharing platforms naturally tilt toward customers in their service concerns.

On the other hand, sharing platforms sometimes claim to be capable of self-regulation, which thus would act as a substitute for government regulation and serve to align the interests of the other parties (consumers and suppliers) involved in this market. Actually though, under this approach government regulations are replaced by the sharing platform's own vetting and reputation system. The platform's vetting systems are prone to abuses and discrimination (e.g., racial or sexual), since the sharing platform has its own interest and economic goals. Further, reputation systems have to improve their accuracy, since they are affected by phenomena such as \"spite grading\" and grade inflation.",

The sharing activities in the main product-service can occur with consumers and many kinds of consumers, but the main idea is that the consumer can gain access while the provider remains the owner (e.g., specialized power tools, high-end camera equipment, and robotics lawn-mowers -typically rarely-used or one-use items). They further depicted the true nature of the large economy's activities, which is likely to have other means besides sharing economy platforms for supporting other various on-demand, second-hand, and product-service rentals (with the black \"Sharing Economy\" circle in the middle partially covering the shaded areas of the three distinct sub-economies.",

Our comments with respect to AI, OR and CS (as well as machine learning, ML) research is a case in point.

An unusual mixture of some of these business emphases was proposed by ForestCar (2020) (www.f6s.com/forestcar), which provides free parking services at airports in exchange for renting out one's own vehicle.A number of empirical research studies have examined the impacts of the ride-sharing market in different regions of the world. For example, Snelling (2019) found that car-sharing social benefits, especially for improving the quality of life for older citizens. Shaheen et al. (2018) reviewed the North and South American transport-sharing markets, and provided numerous insightful descriptive statistics on the number of operators, their fleet sizes, vehicle and member growth to gauge how many customers are served per car available, the countries where they penetrated, and the substantial dominance of for-profit business models. In addition, Guo et al. (2018b, 2019) examined the case of Didi Chuxing and Uber's impacts on the new car market in 51 Chinese cities from 2013 to 2015.",

Similarly, participants in car-sharing schemes own fewer cars than non-participants(Becker et al., 2018), with 20% of people likely to give up a planned car purchase or shed a current car when a suitable car-sharing system becomes available(Liao et al., 2018). Other related works suggest that car-sharing has beneficial marginal effects on reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) (Jung and Koo, 2018) and overall energy use in transport services, while the marginal effects on employment and regional growth are unclear (Chen and Kockelman, 2016).In the Retail sector, the emphasis is not so much on sharing goods, but actually transferring the ownership. This is known as collaborative consumption, where individuals prolong the useful life of goods that they no longer use by selling them to other individuals(Belk, 2014b;Matzler et al., 2015).The peer-to-peer features of sharing systems are present in this approach(Botsman and Rogers,   2013). Such a scheme has always existed in the form of flea markets, garage sales, and car boot sales, but they recently gained a worldwide dimension through the use of technology platforms on the Internet. The most well-known case is eBay (ebay.com)(Chircu et al., 2000), with revenues over USD 10.8 billion in 2019(Statista, 2020b). Also, Etsy (etsy.com), which specializes in handmade or vintage products and reached revenues slightly over USD 812 million in 2019(Statista, 2020c).Examples of specialized platforms are Poshmark (poshmark.com), Gwinnie Bee (closet.gwinniebee.com), Rent the Runway (renttherunway.com), and Bag, Borrow or Steal (bagborroworsteal.com) which are devoted to used fashion and second-hand clothing and",

For example, Ganapati and Reddick (2018) reported on the case of Fly4me (http://fly4me.be) and Sky-Watch (https://sky-watch.com), and the investments sharing companies themselves have been making into high technology, such as the case of Uber with selfdriving cars (Tussyadiah et al., 2017).",

Uber, Lyft and Grab Taxi, in the ride-sharing space, have been especially interesting in this respect, since they have rejected what Satopaa and Mehrotra (2018) refer to as the \"asset-heavy\" business models of traditional hotel and taxi service providers. They further point to a number of reasons as to why such sharing economy firms (among others) have been able to penetrate traditional markets, generate high profitability, and dominate their marketspaces. They include the following: low barriers to market entry; disruptive growth potential; the power of the sharing economy platform business model; the changes in bargaining power of incumbent firms; and the perceived and actual new environmental sustainability of their operations.We have earlier referred to this phenomenon as one involving newly-vulnerable markets in digital travel services and online travel agent changes(Granados et al., 2008), for which the theoretical perspectives were developed earlier byBaumol and Willig (1981) andClemons et al. (2003). The related arguments, including newly-vulnerable incumbents due to last-generation technical infrastructures, markets that are newly-attractive to attack by sharing economy entrants, and customer profitability gradients that can be leveraged through the acquisition of much more informative data about their actual preferences -from financial services(Clemons and Thatcher, 2008) and social media (Clemons et al., 2017), newly-available big data and computational social science analytics (Kauffman et al., 2017), and extraordinary sensing and data capture approaches involving digital traces of human behavior (Liu et al., 2010, Chang et al., 2014).",

Remane et al. (2016) went deeper by analyzing 80+ companies, employing 15 dimensions grouped around five classes: value proposition, interface, service platform, organizing model, and revenue model. Similarly, Mu\u00f1oz and Cohen (2017) analyzed 36 companies employing 7 dimensions: collaborative governance, mission drivers, underutilized resources, alternative funding, peer-to-peer interaction, leverage on technology, and platform. A different approach was taken by Perboli et al. (2018), who adopted the customer's view and (though they only analyzed four companies), performed Monte Carlo simulation for what-if analysis related to profitability for changes in tariff plans. In addition, Fraiberger and Sundararajan (2015) proposed a general model of the sharing economy for durable assets, where owners and renters act in a combination of resale and rental markets. They reported that ownership will be gradually replaced by rentals and, in addition, the prices of used goods will be lower, so there will be a contraction of sale revenues. But what makes sharing business models different from traditional ones? Kathan et al. (2016) have tried to identify the features of sharing that have made it thrive and proposed these factors. (1) The ubiquity of the Internet is making sharing possible at scale now, though sharing trade models have always existed on a more limited scale (Frenken and Schor, 2017). (2) A shift in attitudes regarding the value of ownership has occurred, such that it is now viewed to be of diminishing importance by the younger generation (Chatterjee et al., 2018). (3) The increased emphasis on environmental sustainability also is playing more of a role, which has influenced people's preferences related to ownership versus renting versus sharing (Ciulli and Kolk, 2019; Nijland and van Meerkerk, 2017). And (4), recent industry business model changes have resulted in the movement of financial profit from manufacturers to individual asset owners to some a greater extent than ever before (Frenken and Schor, 2017). The use of several business models should be evaluated in greater depth in the future. Though several of them presently co-exist (or may in the near future), the emergence of a dominant business model should be the result of several factors. For example, the price disruptions brought about by C2C / P2P transactions and economic exchange may emerge as a feature of the dominant business",

The typical interpretation of sharing economy outcome assessment has been through Coasian value maximization in which transaction costs are reduced nearly to zero while consumer free-riding is deterred. In this vein,Mi  and Coffman (2019) have argued that balanced ecological and economic efficiency are both required if societies are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals that the United Nations (2015) has laid out. Conflicts between the goals of profit maximization and other prosocial sustainability-focused objectives are bound to come into conflict, so research that examines how to \"harmonize rather than optimize\" the outcomes with the joint involvement of governments-regulators, users-consumers, enterprises-organizations, and owners-renters -are likely to be crucial.

Thus, an equally valid direction for research -beyond the issue of prosocial objective functions and sustainability -is to delve more deeply into managing the corporate engines for economic success in a quickly changing consumer, social, economic and regulatory environment. It will be similarly useful to probe deeper to understand the fundamental issues with sharing economy suppliers' trust, such as in ride-sharing (Cheng et al., 2020) and accommodations (Wang and Filieri, 2019). \uf0b7 Research Direction 4 (Extend the Research Coverage of Sharing Services to New Societal Functions and Geospatially-Inclusive Regions). We recommend increasing the span of sharing services research, both in the spatial dimension, by studying the sharing economy in new geographical areas, and in the services dimension, by exporting the main sharing business models for a wider array of services contexts than only accommodation and transportations. In a Guardian (U.K. newspaper) article several years ago, Frenken et al. (2015) provided a useful characterization of the sharing economy as being composed of three distinct economic processes: an on-demand economy; a second-hand economy; and a product-service economy.

            "text": "Sharing Economy Product and Service Examples and an Overview of IntermediariesIn the Media sector, for example, the most well-known brands are Hulu (www.hulu. com), Spotify (www.spotify.com), and Netflix (www.netflix.com). Consumers pay for listening to music or watching a video but do not obtain property rights on what they wish to consume. Instead, they only are able to gain temporary access to the digital content. And this suggest why some have referred to the developments that we study in this article as the \"access economy\" instead of the sharing economy(Stepanek, 2018).Similarly, in the Accommodation sector, the most widespread service is renting out a room. This can be seen as a massive diffusion of the classic Bed & Breakfast accommodation and hospitality model, but in some cases, there is a complete home exchange rather than simple cohabitation and sharing. In this sector, the most well-known brand is Airbnb (www.airbnb.com), with USD 2.6 billion in revenues in 2017 (Lima, 2019), and USD 4.3 billion for the year through August 2019 (AllTheRooms, 2020). In contrast, two other companies act as intermediaries for free hospitality services. They include: Couchsurfing (www.couchsurfing.com), which was launched in 2003 and reached 15 million users in early 2018, with about 4 million users per year (van Brugen, 2018); and the volunteer organization, BeWelcome (www.bewelcome.org, 2020), which had 125,626 users at the end of 2019.Other sharing economy platforms in the Accommodations sector are intended for more specific categories, such as WarmShowers (www.warmshowers.org), which is devoted to cyclists, Hostwriter (HostWriter.org, 2020), which focuses on supporting journalists so they can collaborate across national borders, and the Evergreen Club (www.evergreenclub.com), a bed-and-breakfast homestay service that serves adults over 50 years old(Zipkin, 2016). A variation of the paid scheme is the case of exchange of hospitality for work, as in the case of TrustedHouseSitters (www.trustedhousesitters.com), where guests are asked to take care of pets, or WWOOF (wwoof.net), where guests work on a farm. The most relevant example of an accommodations exchange platform is HomeExchange (www.homeexchange.com, 2019), which advertises 300,000 homes. Though the most visible impacts on the Accommodation sector is to undermine the business of hotels, Fang et al. (2016) have shown that the most-impacted ones are low-end hotels, but there is a side positive effect on tourism business, since the number of tourists, as well as their overall spending increase (Zervas et al., 2017). The Transportation and Retail sectors are close, in third place. As to the Transport sector, the services that are supplied can be grouped under three categories: driving services, vehicle rental, and parking space rental (Tart et al., 2018). In the driving services category, the most well-known brand is Uber (www.uber.com), which provides a taxi-like transportation service and had market shares of between 74% (September 2017) and 69% share of the U.S. ride-hailing market (plus or minus) over the past four years (Statista, 2020a). 9 Meanwhile, Uber's competitor, Lyft (www.lyft.com), had a 30.3% share in 2019, according to a corroborating source (Zacks, 2019). Elsewhere, Didi Chuxing (www.didiglobal.com) started up in the Chinese market, where it took over Uber's nascent Chinese operations several years ago (Soo and Perez, 2016). More recently, it has moved toward establishing operations with greater international scope, including other large countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Australia (Dai, 2020). A variant of the typical ride-hailing services is known as carpooling, which was proposed by BlaBlaCar (2020a, 2020b) (www.blablacar.com). Its services allow more persons to share a journey in a car that would otherwise have empty seats. BlaBlaCar claimed to have 70 million members in 22 countries and over 25 million in the U.S. ride-sharing market by the second quarter of 2019 (Vleugel, 2019).A lesser-known but nevertheless active service niche is car rental, in which an individual can rent a car owned by another person. Examples of companies offering such services are Turo (https://turo.com) and RVShare (rvshare.com). The latter specializes in recreational vehicles (RVs) such as motorhomes and caravans. Individuals can also rent out their unused parking spaces through the JustPark platform (www.justpark.com), which had approximately 2.5 million registered users9 Ride-sharing market shares are typically denominated in terms of monthly or quarterly active platform consumers served (Vleugel, 2019; Zacks, 2019).",

Improving the algorithmic efficiency of platform systems and architectures should be done to cope with increasing consumer requirements concerning the scale, service features, and constraints that such platforms must operate within. sharing economy platforms have created an innovative set of opportunities for entrepreneurs and consumers alike, it is critical to reflect on the extent to which sharing economy firms have actually succeeded in delivering the expected levels of greater transparency, more widespread participation, ubiquitous social connections and high consumer value to their key constituents (Frenken and Schor, 2017). In this context, the scale, service features and constraints that sharing platforms operate within have become mission-critical aspects that are founded on the algorithmic efficiency and performance characteristic of their technical components and software (Horton and Zeckhauser, 2016). This extends, for example, to queue-based congestion pricing (Banerjee et al., 2015) and spatial price discrimination (Bimpikis et al., 2019) in ride-sharing. \uf0b7 Research Direction 2 (Develop New Research Emphasis on Ecological and Pro-Social Objective Functions for the Sharing Economy and Sustainable Society).
