Presented here are preliminary outcomes for 39 patients with severe to life-77 threatening COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusions at a single academic 78 medical center, The Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York City.79 Forty-five adult patients were identified as eligible for COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion 82 under the criteria established for the FDA single patient emergency investigational new drug 83 (eIND) process. FDA authorization was requested and obtained for COVID-19 convalescent 84 plasma transfusion. Four patients improved and 2 patients withdrew consent prior to receipt of 85 plasma, leaving 39 evaluable patients who received COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Patients 86 were hospitalized in a single academic medical center in New York City for COVID-19 between 24 87 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. Patients were screened by symptom duration and by severity of 88 disease on a case-by-case basis, as assessed by oxygen supplementation requirements and 89 laboratory parameters. Patients or their legally authorized representatives provided informed 90 consent prior to treatment. Both treatment and research were performed with the oversight of 91 the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Review Board (IRB). 92 Convalescent plasma donors were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers by a two-step Spike 94 protein-directed ELISA. 20,21 Donors with anti-spike antibody titers \u22651:320 were referred for blood 95 collection at the New York Blood Center, which performed the plasmapheresis and then returned 96 convalescent plasma units to The Mount Sinai Hospital.
