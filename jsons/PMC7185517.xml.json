The same resistance mutation was found in viruses isolated from influenza A/H5N1 infected patients treated with oseltamivir.5 As a consequence of massive use of NAIs during the pandemic, appearances of influenza viruses resistant to these drugs are to be expected.6, 7\n",

Pyrosequencing,9 a method to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), has become a well accepted method for sensitive screening of SNP resistant mutations as such. However, as a result of extensive washing procedures with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) generated amplicons this technique may lead to false positive results. RT-PCR can be used for SNP analysis as well, by designing primers and probes that discrimination between wild type and mutant sequences. Excellent discrimination properties are achieved by incorporation of locked-nucleic acid (LNA) bases in these probes that increase melting temperatures, thus allowing the probe to be shorter with increased discriminative capacities.10\n",

For the influenza A matrix, pandemic H1 and N1 RT-PCRs the following amplification conditions were used: UNG reaction at 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, cDNA reaction at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min and PCR amplification at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 20 s, 62 \u00b0C for 1 min. The matrix RT-PCR included 40 pmol forward, 30 pmol reverse primer and 5 pmol of the probe. For the pandemic H1 and N1 RT-PCR, 30 pmol of the primers and 10 pmol probes was used. The H275Y discrimination assay compromises 20 pmol for forward and reverse primer and 5 pmol for both probes and the thermal cycling profile was similar except for the elongation temperature which was 60 \u00b0C instead of 62 \u00b0C. All reactions were done in a total reaction volume of 50 \u03bcl, including 20 \u03bcl of nucleic acid.

Currently, no vaccines are available and antiviral drugs are the only line of defense. Recently, a pandemic influenza sequence was uploaded to the influenza sequence database that encoded for a H275Y variant (Genbank accession no. GQ365445). It is still unclear whether this virus is oseltamivir resistant and can be transmitted, but since the global spread of oseltamivir resistance in the seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus population, focus on this mutation is needed. We have evaluated a novel RT-PCR assay for sub-typing the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus. Both RT-PCRs are sensitive, specific and can be incorporated directly into existing influenza detection and sub-typing algorithms. For validation of the H275Y discrimination assay, virus isolates were chosen that were derived from pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 infected patients before oseltamivir treatment. These patients respond well to oseltamivir treatment in general,16 therefore we assume that no H275Y minor variants were present in these samples. Taken these samples as a baseline, up to 5% for the H275Y oseltamivir resistant mutants could be detected in mixed virus populations using the H275Y discrimination assay (see Fig. 2). A drawback of genotypic screening for antiviral resistance mutations by RT-PCR is the potential appearances of unwanted mismatches in the primer and probe regions, due to antigenic drift. For diagnostic purposes, the discrimination RT-PCR assays should therefore be performed in parallel with influenza RT-PCR assays targeting more conserved regions of the influenza viral genome.",
