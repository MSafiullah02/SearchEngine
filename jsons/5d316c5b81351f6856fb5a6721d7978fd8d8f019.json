South Korea is one of the countries most affected by COVID-19 from the very early stages of this pandemic. Explosive outbreaks occurred across South Korea in the first two months, and efforts to control this new virus have involved everyone across the country. To curb the transmission of the virus, health-care professionals, committees, and governments have combined many approaches, such as extensive COVID-19 screening, effective patient triage, the transparent provision of information, and the use of information technology. This experience could provide some valuable ideas and lessons to others who are fighting against COVID-19.",

A person (31st case) who developed atypical pneumonia without any history of travel to an area with a COVID-19 outbreak was identified in the Daegu area, and the turmoil began. 2 Following this case, hundreds of new patients were reported every day, especially in Daegu and the neighboring area. A religious gathering was found to be the hot spot at the center of the spread of the virus. Around that time in the neighboring area, a substantial portion of the patients in closed neuropsychiatric wards developed respiratory symptoms. Later, more than 100 people, including most patients and some health professionals in the ward, were diagnosed with COVID-19. Chinese caregivers who had visited Wuhan and subsequently volunteered in a religious capacity in this hospital were presumed to be the origin of the outbreak in Daegu, although the epidemiological connection was still under-investigated. Many new clusters were reported in hospitals, senior care facilities, indoor sports facilities, banquets, and workplaces, such as call centers. According to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 80% of the COVID-19 cases were related to these clusters.",

In March 2020, there were more than 7000 patients in this area, and even confirmed patients were not hospitalized. There were patients, especially elderly patients, who had many comorbidities and died while waiting for admission. Among the more than 9000 patients with COVID-19 in South Korea, 158 patients died. More than 90% of the patients were from Daegu and the surrounding areas. 2 There was also a serious shortage of health-care staff and protective equipment. The government recruited volunteer health-care professionals, including physicians and nurses, and dispatched military medical teams to address the outbreaks in Daegu, but these measures were not enough. These strategies did increase the speed of patient triage, enabling critical patients to be treated faster and decreasing the mortality rate. Patients were classified based on COVID-19 severity determined by the modified early warning score 3 and several other factors. The categories were mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Using this triage system, the treatment location was determined for each patient. For example, patients with mild COVID-19, especially those younger than 50 years old, were instructed to stay in a designated place with monitoring or to remain at home instead of in the hospital. However, sometimes this system did not function adequately. In some cases, patients with mild cases who were already occupying hospital beds refused to move to another location because they insisted that it was first come, first served, regardless of the patient triage system. Such a system truly needs to be applied from the beginning of an outbreak.",

One is to identify patients early to halt the spread of the virus in the community, and another is to avoid the possibility of having to shut down unaffected hospitals due to contagion. All patients who visited the hospital regardless of the reason for their visit were expected to fill out a questionnaire before entering the hospital about any fever, any respiratory symptoms, their travel history, and any history of contact with people with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Then they were allowed to enter the hospital, depending on their symptoms. The patients who were suspected of having COVID-19 were expected to visit a COVID-19 screening site first or to call the hot line before their visit. COVID-19 screening was performed for patients who were strongly suspected of having COVID-19, as well as many asymptomatic groups with epidemiological evidence suggesting the possibility of infection. For example, all members of a specific religious group in Daegu, asymptomatic people related to COVID-19 clusters, and all pneumonia cases regardless of cause were tested for COVID-19. Those extensive screenings allowed the early identification of asymptomatic or mild patients who had viral loads. The relatively low mortality rate due to COVID-19 in South Korea might be the result of the inclusion of more asymptomatic or mild cases in the total number of cases compared with other countries.",
