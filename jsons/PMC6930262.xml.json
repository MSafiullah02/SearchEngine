PEDV, which is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus1,2, can spread mainly through the fecal-oral route as well as airborne transmission under specific conditions3. Since PED was first determined in England in the 1970s, it had spread rapidly from Europe to America, Canada and Mexico, and then recurred in Asian countries, such as Japan and South Korea2,4,5. PEDV infection can occur in all ages of pigs, but neonatal piglets are most susceptible and sensitive to the virus, characterized by acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, and accompanied by anorexia and depression, dehydration, and even death6\u20139. In May 2013, PEDV outbreaks in America caused more than the death of 8 million newborn piglets during an epidemic year10\u201312. From the late 2010s, an increasing number of pig farms suffered from the PED-induced huge losses13. Given the severity of PED and the lack of effective protective measures, extensive and in-depth studies of PED should be carried out to better understand its pathology.",

Barrier integrity of the intestinal epithelium can protect the intestine from foreign materials and allow nutrients to cross the epithelium14. Post-weaning piglets are susceptible to environmental, physiological and even nutritional stresses. Due to its incomplete development of the digestive and immune systems, they are more vulnerable to pathogenic bacteria and viruses, leading to compromised intestinal function and severe diarrhea. PEDV strains are highly enteropathogenic and can impair pig intestinal barrier integrity and crypt stem cell proliferation15, reduce the expression of tight junction proteins16,17, and accordingly inhibit the growth performance of pigs. Previous studies identified the molecular characterization of PEDV18,19 and host pathological responses to the virus20,21. However, the mechanisms by which PEDV induces the alteration of specific functions of the gastrointestinal tract, such as nutrient absorption, are largely unknown in nursery pigs. We hypothesized that intestinal dysfunction caused by PEDV infection is related to impaired nutrient transport. To test this hypothesis, the present study was conducted to investigate gene expression profiles of nutrient transporters in the small intestine of pigs infected with PEDV. Our findings are expected to provide a theoretical basis for PED prevention and treatment.",

By analyzing the enrichment of differentially expressed genes, we found that several pathways were regulated by PEDV infection, such as citrulline and arginine biosynthesis, interferon signaling, GDP-glucose biosynthesis, fatty acid activation, proline biosynthesis (from arginine), urea cycle, glucose, and glucose-1-phosphate degradation. Among these pathways, PEDV infection greatly affected lipid metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis in piglets.",

In addition, Wang et al.9 reported reductions in the mRNA levels for FABP2 in the jejunum of PDEV-infected piglets. Our results are consistent with those from these two studies although SLC6A14 expression was not determined in the present study. Regarding the omic studies with PEDV-infected pigs, Sun et al.22 found that PEDV infection enhanced the expression of 7044 genes and most of them were related to the immune response to infectious disease pathways. Of note, based on the KEGG analysis, 374 of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are related to nutrient transport and catabolism, and this result is in good agreement with that of our present study. Similarly, an in vitro study involving the RNA-seq analysis of Vero E6 cells revealed that the DEGs were mainly related to the immune response and the mTOR signaling pathway that play a vital role in PEDV antiviral regulation23. Likewise, results of proteomic analysis indicated that PEDV infections in pigs altered the abundance of several jejunal proteins involved in cell function and immune response24.",

Besides, concentrations of D-xylose and i-FABP were decreased, whereas DAO activity was increased in plasma. Because plasma D-xylose, DAO, and i-FABP have been recognized as biomarkers for assessing intestinal barrier function and integrity9,25,29, decreased D-xylose along with elevated DAO and i-FABP in plasma indicated that PEDV administration could induce intestinal damage and impair intestinal function in piglets.

The expression of genes encoding for water channels, such as AQP3, AQP8, and AQP10 was decreased in both jejunal and ileal mucosae after PEDV infection. Meanwhile, the expression of genes encoding for ion transports was also regulated by PEDV. Specifically, KCNJ13, which encodes for a potassium channel family protein that allows potassium ions to pass into cells31, and TRPV6, which functions as a membrane calcium channel32, were down-regulated; but CFTR, a chloride channel33, was up-regulated in PEDV-infected piglets. Zhang et al.34 reported that elevation of CFTR expression is usually associated with clinical secretory diarrhea. Recently, PEDV infection has also been reported to remarkably decrease the activities of Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase in enterocytes, thereby inducing abnormal Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ distribution35. Besides, PEDV infection down-regulated the expression of the NHE3 gene, which plays a significant part in NaCl reabsorption36. The expression and activity of NHE3 were usually significantly inhibited in inflammatory bowel disease and cholera toxin-induced diarrhea37,38. Interestingly, chloride plays an important role in maintaining electrolyte balance and blood osmotic pressure; therefore, the elevation of chloride in plasma may be attributed to an impairment of intestinal chloride transport and the severe dehydration of PEDV-infected piglets. Collectively, PEDV may induce water and ion imbalances, and consequently result in severe diarrhea and dehydration in piglets.",

There are extensive studies regarding the effects of virus on the expression of glucose transporters. Both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection can down-regulate GLUT1/2 gene expression, causing the inhibition of glucose absorption42,43. However, the infection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) can up-regulate GLUT 1/3/4 expression and increase the capacity of virus-infected cells to transport glucose44,45. The discrepancy in the expressions of intestinal glucose transporters may be attributed to the differences in virus types and experimental animals. In the present study, PEDV increased expression of SGLT1 but decreased expression of GLUT2 in the piglet small intestine, indicating that PEDV induced a disorder of glucose transport in the gut. George et al.46 reported that activated INSR can stimulate the PI3-K signaling pathway, which could not only promote glucose transport by GLUTs, but also inhibit gluconeogenesis by reducing PCK1 that encodes for a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis PEPCK-C47. Similarly, the down-regulated expression of the INSR gene, but up-regulated expression of the PCK1 gene were observed in the small intestine after PEDV infection. Therefore, we surmise that PEDV may alter intestinal glucose absorption and metabolism by regulating GLUT, SGLT1, INSR, and PCK1 expression in pigs.",

            "text": "Thirdly, PEDV infection could affect the intestinal amino acid transport and metabolism. Amino acids are preferential nutrients for the intestinal tract to synthesize intestinal proteins, polyamines, nitric oxide, ATP, and other products with enormous biological function48\u201350. In the present study, amino acid profiles in both plasma and jejunum were dramatically altered by PEDV infection. Specifically, basic amino acid (histidine, lysine, and arginine) concentrations were reduced in the jejunal mucosa of PEDV-infected piglets. Arginine is considered to be the nitrogenous precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide and as a regulator to prevent cell death and promote protein synthesis51\u201353. It can be synthesized from citrulline in plasma and from ornithine in the mitochondria of intestinal mucosa catalyzed by ASS130. Arginine is metabolized in two ways: one is that arginine is decomposed into ornithine and urea catalyzed by arginase 1 (ARG1), the other is that arginine is metabolized into citrulline and NO catalyzed by NO synthase (NOS)54. In the present study, PEDV infection up-regulated ASS1 and ARG1 gene expression in the jejunal mucosa, indicating the abnormality of arginine metabolism. Besides, expression of basic amino acid transporters b0,+AT and y+LAT1 was down-regulated in PEDV-infected piglets, which may explain the reduction of basic amino acids. b0,+AT1 and rBAT are located in the apical membrane of epithelial cells and are responsible for transporting basic amino acids and cystine into cells from the intestinal lumen, while exchanging neutral amino acids55,56. y+LAT1 is located in the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells and is responsible for transporting basic amino acids into the blood from the intestinal cells while exchanging neutral amino acids57. Intriguingly, concentrations of acidic amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) were increased, while an acidic amino acid transporter SLC1A1 was down-regulated in the jejunum of PEDV-infected piglets. Wu58 reported that glutamate and aspartate, along with glutamine, are the major energy substrates for enterocytes. These amino acids play an important role in pig growth performance, gene expression regulation, cell signaling pathway, tight-junction integrity, hormone secretion, antioxidant capacity, and neural regulation59\u201363. The higher content of acidic amino acids in the jejunum may be due to the higher demand for these amino acids under pathological conditions. Other amino acids, including asparagine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine were increased in the PEDV group in both the jejunal mucosa and plasma, which might be related to the up-regulated expression of neutral amino acid transporters, such as B0AT1 and ASCT264. However, glycine and cysteine (two of the three substrates for GSH synthesis), as well as proline, threonine, hydroxyproline, taurine, and alanine were decreased in the jejunal mucosa and plasma after PEDV infection, indicating disorders in protein metabolism and amino acid absorption. PepT1 is the transporter of di- and tri-peptides, locating in the brush border of the intestine65,66. Osmanyan et al.56 reported that the end-products of protein digestion, i.e. small peptides and amino acids, may affect the expression of PepT1. In the present study, the reduction in PepT1 expression in the PEDV group further demonstrates the abnormal metabolism of protein and amino acids in PEDV-infected piglets. Moreover, plasma urea concentration is an indicator of amino acid metabolism in the body and may be negatively correlated with piglet growth performance67. Therefore, PEDV infection may inhibit protein synthesis, while stimulating protein degradation and amino acid catabolism in the whole body. Taken together, PEDV infection may promote the degradation of body protein and impair intestinal amino acid absorption, transport and metabolism by altering the expression of amino acid transporters.",

            "text": "Moreover, lipid transport and metabolism may also be regulated by PEDV infection in piglets. PEDV could interfere with fatty acid transport by down-regulating the expression of FABP1, FABP2, and SLC27A4 in jejunal and ileal mucosae. FABP1 and FABP2 are predominantly expressed in the proximal and distal part of the small intestine, respectively68. Both of them play an important role in uptake, transport, and metabolism of fatty acids. SLC27A4 functions mainly as a transporter which transports long-chain fatty acids across the plasma membrane and seems to be the principal fatty acid transporter in enterocytes69,70. A decrease in FABP1, FABP2, and SLC27A4 expression may result in inhibition of fatty acid absorption and transport by enterocytes. However, FABP6 expression was increased by PEDV infection in the ileum of piglets. Furuhashi et al.68 showed that FABP6 could bind bile acids, the metabolites of cholesterol, and are crucial for the absorption and transport of lipids and vitamins. Therefore, PEDV can differentially regulate the expression of intestinal lipid transporters. Furthermore, PEDV may decrease the synthesis of fatty acids by down-regulating SLC27A2, ACSL3 and FASN expression in the small intestine. SLC27A2 and ACSL3 are isozymes of the long-chain fatty-acid-coenzyme A ligase family, which convert free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, and hence play a crucial part in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation71. FASN catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain saturated fatty acids, which are precursors of nutritionally and physiologically significant mono-unsaturated fatty acids in animals, including pigs67.",

APOA1 is the main protein component of HDL in plasma and, therefore, is important for promoting cholesterol efflux from tissues to the liver for excretion72,73. Down-regulation of the APOA1 gene is associated with HDL deficiencies. APOC2 is the component of very low density lipoprotein. Liu et al.74 reported that APOC2 could activate LPL (an enzyme on the outer surface of endothelial cells that is responsible for the hydrolysis of plasma triglycerides), thereby playing an important role in converting triglycerides into free fatty acids for cells. APOA4 participates in the maturation of HDL and assisting APOC2 activation of LPL, and plays a vital role in the reverse transport of cholesterol. Hence, it is apparent that PEDV infection decreased the concentration of plasma HDL through the reduction of intestinal APOA1 and APOA4 expression (Fig. 4). Meanwhile, down-regulation of APOC2 may be associated with the disorder of cholesterol metabolism, and consequently result in the accumulation of cholesterol and impair enterocytes.",

PEDV infection decreased expression of AQPs, amino acid transporters (y+LAT1, SLC1A1, b0,+AT, rBAT, and PepT1), altered amino acid profiles in the plasma and jejunum, affected lipid and glucose absorption and metabolism in the jejunal and ileal mucosae. These results could provide researchers with more insights in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for PEDV infection-induced intestinal dysfunction.",

All piglets used in the current study were purchased from a PEDV-free farm and were born at term (114 days of gestation). Sixteen crossbred healthy female pigs (Duroc \u00d7 Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire, 7 days of age, with the same gender), initially weighing 2.86 \u00b1 0.30 kg, were used in this experiment. Pigs were penned individually (2.0 \u00d7 3.0-m pens) in two rooms in a temperature-controlled nursery barn (25\u201327 \u00b0C). All piglets were fed a liquid milk replacer (Wuhan Anyou Feed Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) with sufficient nutrients. The liquid diet was formulated according to the ratio of diet/water (1:4). Namely, 20 g milk replacer (powder) was dissolved in 80 mL warm water (50 \u00b1 5 \u00b0C) to prepare the liquid feed. Each pig was fed four times per day (100 g dry matter per pig per day). This feeding strategy (more frequent provision of food at a small amount for each feeding) was adopted to prevent intestinal lesions and improve feed efficiency. Pigs had free access to drinking water. The incidence of diarrhea was observed and recorded 3 times per day throughout the whole experiment. Pig feces was classified at four levels: 0, normal; 1, pasty; 2, semiliquid; and 3, liquid75,76. The occurrence of diarrhea was defined as the maintenance of feces at Level 2 or Level 3 for 2 consecutive days. Then the diarrhea incidence was calculated according to the following formula: incidence of diarrhea = total number of pigs with diarrhea / (total number of pigs \u00d7 experimental days) \u00d7 100%. The \u201ctotal number of pigs with diarrhea\u201d in the formula was defined as the sum of the number of pigs with diarrhea observed each day.",
