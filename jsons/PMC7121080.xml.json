Merck pharmaceutical company reported that developed immune responses against influenza virus antigens in mice after injecting the naked plasmids intramuscularly (Ulmer et al. 1993). Similarly, Robinson proved the ability of DNA plasmids against influenza virus antigens (Fynan et al. 1993). The capability of plasmids carrying HIV antigens or tumor antigens to generate immune responses and protection from tumor in mice has been described (Wang et al. 1993). Importantly, a DNA vaccine affects humoral as well as cellular immunity. The use of the DNA approach also promised to overcome the safety concerns associated with live vaccines\u2014their reversion risks and their potential spread to unintended individuals, avoids the risks linked to the manufacture of killed vaccine (Ruprecht 1999).",

First-generation vaccines providing maximum protection but associated with a risk that attenuated forms of a pathogen can revert to a dangerous form and may still be able to cause disease, especially in immune compromised vaccine recipients (e.g., AIDS patients). Killed vaccines cannot generate specific killer T-cell responses and will be effective against limited diseases where cellular response is not essential (Alarcon et al. 1999).

These vaccines are able to generate TH and antibody responses, but not killer T-cell responses. This reason again restricted the utility of these vaccines to limited number of diseases. Today is the era of genetic immunization, which is next-generation vaccine (third generation), which seems to be highly effective till date. This strategy is based upon improved gene optimization, improved RNA structural design, novel formulations and immune adjuvants, and more effective delivery approaches (Alarcon et al. 1999; Robinson and Pertmer 2000). At the cellular level, introduction of nanotechnology and the development of nanocarrier-based vaccines provide effective immunization through better targeting and by triggering antibody responses. In order to induce an effective protective immunity, these vaccines require boosting with agents called adjuvants. Adjuvants and delivery vehicles have shown to protect antigens from degradation. The current trend toward many efforts to develop novel adjuvants and carrier have persistent on systems at the micro- and nanoscale.",

The human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter has been extensively used for high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells (Boshart et al. 1985). However, there are some drawbacks associated with CMV promoters like chromatin condensation by histone deacetylase. Recently, histone deacetylase inhibitors have been supplemented with CMV promoter-based plasmid that has shown increased expression of DNA vaccine antigens (Lai et al. 2010). Further, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) immediate-early promoter one (ie1) have also demonstrated better gene expression in insect cells compared with CMV promoter (He et al. 2008). The porcine circovirus type 1 capsid gene promoter has enhanced the antigen expression and immunogenicity in a HIV-1 plasmid vaccine (Tanzer et al. 2011).",

For example, aluminum adjuvants adsorbed DTP elicit early and higher antibody response after primary immunization than do unadjuvanted preparations.Vaccine adjuvants can modulate antibody avidity, specificity, quantity, isotype, and subclass against epitopes on complex immunogens.They target antigen to a cell-surface receptor on APCs by formation of multimolecular aggregates.They can direct antigen presentations by direct peptide exchange on surface MHC molecules or by MHC class I or MHC class II pathways by means of fusion or disruption of cell membranes (Newman and Powell 1995).\n",

Freund\u2019s Complete Adjuvant (FCA) is composed of inactivated and dried mycobacteria whereas the incomplete form (FIA) lacks the mycobacterial components. Although, FCA has been proved as a potent inducer of cell-mediated immunity and ability to boost the humoral immune response, but associated adverse side effects like sterile abscesses, granulomas, muscle indurations, plasma cell neoplasia, ascites and amyloidosis has limits its utility. A modified version of FCA is known as Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant (FIA) in which antigen is administered in water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion but without mycobacterial components. It consists of a mixture of mineral oil (Drakeol 6VR, Bayol F, Marcol 52) (85 % v/v) and emulsifier (mannide monooleate) (15 % v/v) with an equal volume of aqueous solution of antigen. Mechanism of the Freund\u2019s adjuvants is allowing a gradual and continuous release of the antigen by establishment of a repository antigen-containing locus at the site of injection or interaction with mononuclear cells such as phagocytic cells, antigen presenting cells, etc. FIA has been included in veterinary vaccines (rabies, hog cholera, canine hepatitis) (Freund et al. 1948; Fastier and Hansen 1964; Ott 1966), as well as human vaccines (tetanus toxoid, influenza vaccines) (Salk et al. 1952). In general, both FIA and FCA are indeed very efficient in raising high antibody titers, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and used in priming immunizations. Morozova et al. investigated that development of inflammatory response in the rat myocardium after immunization rats with single subcutaneous injection of cardiac myosin (800 ug/kg) with incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (IFA) (Gjessing et al. 2012). There are very limited studies that have been conducted which signify their utility of Freund\u2019s adjuvant for DNA vaccination. It has been demonstrated that plasmid pv-16CpG suspended in IFA has significantly enhanced both type of cellular and humoral immune responses to HBsAg (Luo et al. 2012).",

However, aluminum adjuvants have certain limitations such as local reactions at the site of injection, IgE antibody responses augmentation, ineffectiveness for some antigens, and inability to supplement cell-mediated immune responses (Gupta et al. 1995). Two methods are used to prepare vaccines and toxoids with aluminum compounds\u2014in situ precipitation of aluminum compounds in the presence of antigen and adsorption of antigen onto preformed aluminum gel (Aprile and Wardlaw 1966; Holt et al. 1994; Hem and White 1995; Gupta 1998). The mechanism of adjuvanticity of aluminum compounds includes formation of a depot, efficient uptake by antigen-presenting cells, stimulation of immune competent cells of the body through induction of eosinophilia, and activation of macrophages and complement. Recently, adjuvanticity of alum has been reported due to cell death and the subsequent release of host cell DNA, which acts as a potent endogenous immunostimulatory signal-mediating alum adjuvant activity (Marichal et al. 2011). Gupta et al. (1996) showed that diphtheria toxoid adsorbed aluminum phosphate induced significant antibody levels in rabbits. Previously, Manam et al. reported that aluminum phosphate adjuvant had shown no effect on the tissue distribution and integration frequency of delivery genetic materials (Manam et al. 2000). Similarly, Liang et al. (2004) showed the similar results indicated that there was not increase in HBsAg expression when plasmid pcDNA3.1-S mixed aluminum phosphate. However, they demonstrated the better antibody titer after intramuscular immunization of BALB/C mice with pcDNA3.1-S mixing aluminum phosphate adjuvant. This study revealed that aluminum phosphate has a potential for DNA vaccination (Liang et al. 2004). Recently, Yu et al. have demonstrated the role of aluminum adjuvant for DNA vaccines against botulinum neurotoxin (BoNTs) and shown induced protective humoral immune responses (Yu et al. 2010). Combined use of IL-12 with alum adjuvants for DNA immunization have also demonstrated the significant change in the survival rates of the vaccinated animals against Toxoplasma gondii (Khosroshahi et al. 2012).",

Cytokines play an important role in induction of immune responses during the processing and presentation of antigens. Numerous cytokines including interleukin-12 (IL-12), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) have been shown to significantly modulate the inflammatory process when given systemically. The local administration of IL-2 increases local expression of major histocompatibility (MHC) class II antigens and enhances skin antigen reactivity, but high bolus doses of IL-2 cause hypotension, exacerbation of underlying autoimmune disease, and induce vascular leak syndrome. This studies revealed that exogenous IL-2 could be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected human by decreases the frequency of apoptotic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs), which may contribute to the increase in circulating CD4+ T cells. IL-2 also induces B-cell activation and antibody synthesis in vitro (Cordiali Fei et al. 1994). Among various improvement strategies, the incorporation of cytokine-expressing plasmids as molecular adjuvants has been widely studied in the past years, yet still without significant clinical application. This chapter reviews recent progress in the co-application of cytokine-encoding genes used for enhancement and direction of immunogenicity, as well as discusses their therapeutic potential for future applications. Co-administration of pro-inflammatory agents (such as various interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, and GM-CSF) plus TH2-inducing cytokines increase antibody responses, whereas pro-inflammatory agents and TH1-inducing cytokines decrease humoral responses and increase cytotoxic responses (which is more important in viral protection, for example). Co-stimulatory molecules like B7-1, B7-2 and CD40L are also sometimes used.",

An important characteristic of MPL adjuvant activity is to enhance the generation of specific immunity without being directly associated with an antigen. The choice of an MPL adjuvant formulation will depend on several factors such as the nature of the antigen, desired immune response characteristics, and level of tolerable local reactogenicity. Aqueous dispersions of MPL in isotonic buffers when admixed with soluble protein antigens can provide a strong adjuvant effect. An advantage of these MPL plus antigen is that they tend to be well tolerated and induce little or no local tissue reaction at the injection site (Qureshi et al. 1985). MPL-A has been used to enhance immunity induced by DNA vaccination against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Results indicate that MPL performances as an effective adjuvant for immunogenic DNA injection despite reduced expression of encoding protein in muscle (Sasaki et al. 1997). Combination of MPL with antigen-encoded DNA has shown the enhanced protective neutralizing antibody response against glycoprotein of the CVS rabies virus (Lodmell et al. 2000). Lipid A has also been admixed with plasmid DNA (pDNA)-coated nanoparticles and studied for their immunological potential. Immunological results revealed that plasmid DNA with lipid A have shown significant higher immunological response, especially cellular response (Cui and Mumper 2003a, b). Studies indicated that LA is potential adjuvants to further enhance immune responses; however, limited studies have been utilized this adjuvant for DNA vaccination.",

Cationic lipid\u2013DNA complexes have been used successfully to deliver plasmid DNA to the lungs, brain, tumors and skin, by local administration, or to vascular endothelial cells after systemic, intravenous injection (Brigham et al. 1989). In addition to different cationic lipids (Fig. 7), zwitter ionic lipids or helper lipids (DOPE and cholesterol) have also shown an important role in membrane perturbation and fusion for intracellular delivery of genetic material.\n",

Gregoriadis et al. for the first time showed that intramuscular immunization of mice with pRc/CMV HBS (encoding the S region of hepatitis B antigen; HBsAg) entrapped into positively charged (cationic) liposomes leads to greatly improved humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Gregoriadis et al. 1997). These cationic liposome-entrapped DNA vaccines generate titers of anti-HBsAg IgG1 antibody isotype in excess of 100-fold higher and increased levels of both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 when compared with naked DNA or DNA complexed with preformed similar (cationic) liposomes. Further, modification of liposomal surface with polymer offers potential for oral administration of plasmid DNA and able to elicit markedly enhanced transgene-specific cytokine production following in vitro restimulation of splenocytes with recombinant antigen (Somavarapu et al. 2003). Modification of lipid/DNA complexes by the polymer poly(d,l-lactic acid) was found to be consistently and significantly more effective than either unmodified liposomal DNA or naked DNA in eliciting transgene-specific immune responses to plasmid-encoded antigen when administered by the s.c. route (Bramwell et al. 2002). Surface-modified mannosylated cationic liposomes were developed for targeted delivery of pDNA to APCs, and the results verified that Man lipoplex induces significantly higher pUb-M gene transfection into dendritic cells and macrophages than unmodified lipoplex and naked DNA and it also strongly induces CTL activity against melanoma, inhibits its growth and prolongs the survival after tumor challenge compared with unmodified liposomes (Lu et al. 2007).",

It was composed of DPPC and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (DMPG). Lack of further progress of these systems may be attributed to the poor association between DNA molecules and anionic lipids by electrostatic repulsion between these negatively charged species (Perrie and Gregoriadis 2000). Liposomes have been prepared from mixtures of anionic and zwitter ionic lipids, 1DOPG and DOPE, respectively, at a molar ratio of 17:83 (DOPG:DOPE). Efficient and relatively safe DNA transfection using anionic lipoplexes makes them an alternative for gene delivery (Patil et al. 2004). Similarly, endosomolytic bacterial protein listeriolysin O (LLO) incorporated in an anionic liposome-entrapped polycation-condensed DNA delivery system (LPDII) has been developed that demonstrated better condensation of the DNA with improved transfection efficiency due to endosomolytic properties of LLO (Lorenzi and Lee 2005). Combination of cationic lipoplexes and PEGylated anionic liposomes has also been used to prepare anionic PEGylated lipoplexes. Studies demonstrated that the gene expression of the developed formulation was similar for the cationic formulation taken as a control and the anionic formulations prepared (Mignet et al. 2008). Overall, anionic lipoplex formulation shown promise as a nonviral vector with high-transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity.",

They can be generated by the insertion of DOPE into acidic lipids liposomes such as cholesteryl hemisuccinate or oleic acid (Venugopalan et al. 2002). It is reported that detergent removal method is a superior method for preparing glycosaminoglycan-resistant and pH-sensitive lipid-coated DNA complexes. This method is produced stable, but acid activatable, lipid-coated DNA complexes (Lehtinen et al. 2008). At the neutral cellular pH 7, these lipids undergo protonation and collapse into a non-bilayer structure of endosomal compartmentalization which in turn helps in the rapid release of DNA into the cytoplasm. Recently, citraconyl-DOPE (a chemical derivative of DOPE), deliver DNA-based therapeutics to cancer cells, in this manner combining the targeting and the rapid endosome release (Reddy and Low 2000). Addition of pH-sensitive fusogenic peptide, GALA (peptide composed of repeating sequences of Glu\u2013Ala\u2013Leu\u2013Ala) in lipidic preparation is also promising method to enhance the expression of the desired proteins. Studies demonstrated that addition of 0.1 \u03bcM GALA to the plasmid/liposome complex significantly increased the transfection efficiency, especially in the case of lipofectin, but higher concentration of GALA decreased transfection efficiency (Futaki et al. 2005; Nakase et al. 2011). Similarly, pH-sensitive histidine-modified galactosylated cholesterol derivative (Gal-His-C4-Chol) has also been synthesized that demonstrate much greater transfection activity than conventional liposomes in HepG2 hepatic cells (Shigeta et al. 2007). Further, pH-sensitive TAT-modified PEGylated liposomes are utilized for delivery of tumor-specific stimuli-sensitive drug and gene delivery systems (Kale and Torchilin 2007).",

Using immunoliposomes, tissue-specific gene delivery has been achieved in the brain, embryonic and breast cancer tissue. Recently, immunoliposomes containing an antibody fragment were successfully used in targeted delivery of tumor-suppressing genes into tumors in vivo (Xu et al. 2002). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene-encoded plasmid was entrapped in pH-sensitive immunoliposomes comprising of H-2Kk antibody-coated liposomes with DOPE, cholesterol, and oleic acid. Studies revealed that approximately 20 % of the injected immunoliposomes were taken up by the target RDM-4 cells. Uptake was much less when liposomes without antibody were used (Wang and Huang 1987). Similarly, these authors have also reported that compositions of liposomes have altered the distribution for targeted drugs. Delivery was also dependent on the lipid composition of the liposome. The pH-sensitive lipid composition gave eightfold higher efficiency than the corresponding pH-insensitive composition (Wang and Huang 1989). Ligand-modified immunoliposomes has been used to efficiently deliver plasmid DNA expressing NS3-NS5B (HCV-specific antigenic sequence) to antigen-presenting cells. Results confirm that this is as a more efficient delivery system than direct intramuscular inoculations with naked DNA (Zubkova et al. 2009). Overall, studies have shown that immunoliposomes are efficiently used for targeted delivery of genetic material, especially in treatment of genetic disorders; however, very limited work has been done for delivery of DNA vaccines.",

Virosome-mediated delivery has low toxicity and high immunogenicity with various prospective applications for the treatment and prevention of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. The use of immunopotentiating reconstituted influenza virosomes (IRIV) as delivery system of DNA appear to be a promising tool in vaccinology and gene therapy. IRIVs are spherical, unilamellar vesicles with a mean diameter of ~150 nm, short surface projections of 10\u201315 nm. IRIVs are prepared by a mixture of natural and synthetic phospholipids containing 70 % egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (for enhancement of immune responses), 20 % synthetic phosphatidylethanolamine (able to directly stimulate B cells to produce antibodies), and 10 % envelope phospholipids originating from H1N1 influenza virus. IRIVs were first utilized in the manufacture of hepatitis A vaccine. The adjuvant function of virosomes is based on their virus-like particle structure providing repetitive antigen presentation to B cells, partial protection from extracellular degradation, and a depot effect (Gluck et al. 1992).",

In most cases, these trials have involved intranasal administration of the vaccine and qualified as safe and well-tolerated materials through various human clinical trials. Proteasome-conjugated Shigella flexneri 2a LPS vaccine shows an immune response similar to that observed after immunization with the live pathogen (Fries et al. 2001). Intranasal delivery of proteasome-based vaccines may be able to produce both systemic and mucosal immunity. Another very similar category of vaccines is the conjugate vaccine. These vaccines consist of a relatively non-immunogenic (especially in infants) antigen linked to a more immunogenic carrier such as a protein or toxoid. The conjugate vaccines for H. influenzae type B (Hib) were developed using Hib polysaccharide conjugated to either diphtheria toxoid (PRP-D), OMP of Neisseria meningitidis (PRP-OMP), mutant diphtheria toxoid CRM197 (HbOC) or tetanus toxoid (PRP-T) to provide the Hib antigen immunogenic (Heath 1998).",

Cochleate delivery vehicles composed of simple, natural materials (phosphatidylserine and calcium) are unique vaccine carrier and delivery formulations (Mannino and Gould-Fogerite 1995). They are nontoxic, noninflammatory, and biodegradable. Cochleates are prepared through the calcium-induced fusion of negatively charged phospholipid liposomes to collapse into solid sheets that roll up or stack, excluding water. The entire cochleate structure is a series of solid layers, components within the interior of the cochleate structure remain intact provides protection from degradation when exposed to harmful environmental conditions or enzymes. The protection of encochleated materials and structural stability of the cochleate allows for efficient delivery of DNA by various routes like mucosal (oral, intragastric, intranasal, and intraocular) and parenteral (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intradermal). Strong, long-lasting, mucosal and circulating, antibody and cell-mediated responses are generated. Protection from challenge with live viruses following oral or intramuscular administration has been achieved (Mannino et al. 1998). Cochleates efficiency can be improved by attachment of surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses and can be integrated into the lipid bilayers. DNA cochleates can be formed by trapping oligonucleotides or high molecular weight plasmids within or between the lipid bilayers (Papahadjopoulos et al. 1975).",

ISCOMs are three-dimensional \u201ccage-like\u201d structures, which have been shown to form upon detergent removal from mixtures of saponins, detergents, and cholesterol. The ISCOM (immunostimulating complex) is a complex consisting of protein antigen, cholesterol, phospholipid, and the saponin adjuvant Quil A. A similar vaccine delivery vehicle and adjuvant has also been developed that uses the same material minus the antigen and is referred to as ISCOMATRIX\u00ae. The antigen can be added later to the ISCOMATRIX\u00ae during formulation of the vaccine. This material seems to work similarly to ISCOMs but provides for more general applications by removing the requirement for hydrophobic antigens (Pearse and Drane 2005). ISCOMs potentiate both humoral and cellular immune responses to incorporated antigens (Cox et al. 1998). ISCOMs stimulate APCs to produce IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12 and induce T-helper cells of both Th1 and Th2 type and the cell-mediated immune response includes CD8+ class I restricted cytotoxic T cells in a variety of experimental animal models and have now progressed to phase I and II human trials (Claassen and Osterhaus 1992; Barr and Mitchell 1996). Oral administration of ISCOM vaccines has been shown effectiveness and immune-potentiating effect, but this route requires the use of high and frequent dosing. A study in which ISCOM vaccines may be able to elicit strong mucosal immune responses when administered in the pelvic pre-sacral space of sheep, which could be useful for immunization against viral infections of the female genital tract (Thapar et al. 1991). A Quil A-containing ISCOM with modified cholera toxin A1 (CTA1-DD) used as a mucosal vaccine carrier system for the influenza virus PR8 antigen (Helgeby et al. 2006). Dong-Ji et al. have utilized combinational approach by priming with C. trachomatis mouse pneumonitis (MoPn) major outer membrane protein (MOMP) DNA and boosting with ISCOM of MOMP protein and shown the potential for protection of BALB/c mice against MoPn lung infection (Dong-Ji et al. 2000). Nasal vaccinations with P6 DNA vaccine and Matrix-M (immunostimulatory complex adjuvant) have shown significant higher IgA-producing cells in addition to Th1 and Th2 cytokine expression. This strategies may provide a new way for the induction of specific immunity at mucosal sites (Kodama et al. 2011).",

Archaeosomes have demonstrated relatively higher stabilities to oxidative stress, high temperature, alkaline pH, action of phospholipases, bile salts, and serum proteins (Patel and Chen 2005; Benvegnu et al. 2009). Archaeosomes facilitated a strong antibody (Th2) response to entrapped protein antigens. The antibody humoral response was superior to that obtained with conventional liposomes and was in some instances comparable to that obtained with the potent but toxic Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Patel and Sprott 1999; Patel and Chen 2005). Sprott et al. have also been described the role of co-enzyme Q10 into archaeosome-based antigen formulation. Incorporation of CoQ10 into archaeosomes and conventional liposomes can enhance the phagocytosis of the resultant vesicles by macrophage cells that allow the alteration in targeting profiles to specific tissues when the vesicles are administered to an animal via different routes and further enhance the immune response to coadministered immunogens. Recently, \u201ccationic archaeosomes,\u201d based on mixtures of neutral/cationic bilayer-forming lipids and archaeobacterial synthetic tetraether-type bipolar lipids, have shown better transfection efficiency and can be utilized for DNA vaccination (Rethore et al. 2007).",

            "text": "At specific concentrations and temperatures, when amphiphilic molecules, or molecules containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, are maintained, naturally form association colloids known as amphiphilic micelles as a result of hydrophobic interactions. Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) is commonly incorporated as the hydrophilic segment in both amphiphilic micelles (Gaucher et al. 2005). Block copolymer micelles are colloidal particles with a size around 5\u2013100 nm, which are currently under investigation as carriers for delivery of biopharmaceuticals. In contrast to cationic polymeric systems, nonionic polymers enhance gene expression through mechanisms, which most likely do not involve DNA condensation and facilitated transport within cells. Adjuvant-active nonionic block copolymers that are flexible, linear structures, flanked on both ends by hydrophilic polyoxyethylene (POE) with a core of hydrophobic polyoxypropylene (POP) with variable ratios (Newman et al. 1998). The block copolymers are useful as general surfactants and display enhanced biological efficacy as vaccine adjuvants. Osmolarity, pH and buffer salts mainly affected the size and morphology of the particles. Molecular weight and formulation mainly affected titer and isotype of antibody. Jain et al. evaluated a system of combined poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) for the delivery of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). PLA forms the hydrophobic core in an aqueous medium, which controlling the release of the antigen as it degrades into lactic acid. An outer shell form by PEG allows for prolonged release patterns and enhanced mucosal uptake to occur (Jain et al. 2009). Hunter et al. (1991) showed that the adjuvant activity of block copolymers varies with the lengths of the chains of polyoxypropylene (POP) and polyoxyethylene (POE). Pluronic block copolymers have been used extensively in a variety of pharmaceutical formulations like low molecular mass drugs and polypeptides. Kabanov et al. (2002) described that these molecules can modify the biological response during gene therapy in the skeletal muscle, resulting in an enhancement of the transgene expression and therapeutic effect of the transgene. Block copolymers were recently used to promote gene delivery of plasmid encoding a food allergen, bovine beta-lactoglobulin. Tetronic 304 based block copolymers have decreased BLG-specific IgE concentrations and reduced local inflammatory response (Adel-Patient et al. 2010). Similarly, triblock copolymers consisting of three alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments are also used to delivery genetic materials. Biodegradable and nontoxic triblock copolymers of PLA\u2013PEG\u2013PLA and PLGA\u2013PEG\u2013PLGA were also utilized micellar carriers for delivery of encapsulated plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)-MA against HCV. Developed carrier system has provided long-term better adjuvant effect with no side effects (Yang et al. 2011). Similarly, copolymers of a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) block and a cationic poly(aminoethyl methacrylate) (PAEM) block have been used for DNA vaccine delivery. Synthesized polyplexes based carrier systems have induced a modest up-regulation of surface markers for DC maturation and better uptake by DCs in the draining lymph nodes (Tang et al. 2010). Further, cationic block copolymers poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with a positively charged poly(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate have been synthesized and utilized for HIV-1 TAT DNA molecules. Results indicated that synthesized cationic block copolymers was safe and ability to deliver genetic material for cell machinery and promising candidate for DNA vaccination (Caputo et al. 2002). Similar to cationic block polymers, nonionic block copolymers of poly(ethyleneoxide)\u2013poly(propyleneoxide) (PEO\u2013PPO) have also been utilized DNA vaccination using a beta-galactosidase (betaGal) encoding plasmid (McIlroy et al. 2009). Herpes simplex virus type-1 genes specifying glycoproteins gB and gD have been also delivered by nonionic block copolymers. Plasmid-encapsulated block polymers have protected the mice against lethal HSV-1 challenge when immunization was performed via the i.m. route (Baghian et al. 2002).",

            "text": "Dendrimers are a unique class of polymeric nanoconstructs having highly branched, three-dimensional, nanoscale architecture with very low polydispersity and high functionality. First discovered in the early 1980s by Donald Tomalia and co-workers, these hyperbranched molecules were called dendrimers. Dendrimers are highly branched, synthetic spherical macromolecules with layered architectures that can be considered analogous to a globular protein. They have the potential for high loading capacities due to small diameters (1.5\u201314.5 nm) through mechanisms such as complexation or formation of chemical bonds at terminal branch points or other active sites (Wiwattanapatapee et al. 2000). In addition, the low polydispersity of dendrimers should provide reproducible pharmacokinetic behavior in contrast to that of some polymers containing fractions with vastly different molecular weight within a given sample (Parekh 2007). Several dendrimer-based products have been approved by the FDA and successfully commercialized for treatment and diagnosis of diseases, Including VivaGel\u2122 (Starpharma) designed as a topical microbicide, SuperFect\u00ae, (Qiagen Pvt Ltd.) used for gene transfection, and Alert Ticket\u2122 (US Army Research Lab) for anthrax detection (Merdan et al. 2002). In the past decade, research has increased on polyamidoamine, polyethylenimines, polylysine, polypropyleneimine, polyaryl ether, polyester, polyglycerol and their derivatives for the design and synthesis of biocompatible dendrimers.",

            "text": "Dendrimers form complexes by electrostatic interaction with all forms of nucleic acids such as DNA, RNA, and antisense oligonucleotides. The nature of the dendrimer\u2013nucleic acid complexes (\u201cdendriplexes\u201d) is dependent on the stoichiometry and concentration of the DNA-phosphates, dendrimer amines, bulk solvent properties (e.g., pH, salt concentration, buffer strength), and even the dynamics of mixing. High ionic strength interferes with the binding process and affects the nature of complexes formed by the different generations, for example, higher-generation PPI dendrimers in higher concentrations form water-soluble dendriplexes, whereas the G1 and G2 PPI dendrimers lead to the formation of electroneutral complexes (Tang and Szoka 1997). Dendrimer\u2013DNA complex is formed by simply mixing the components in an aqueous solution. Transfection property can be improved by the use of an excess of cationic dendrimer because the negatively charged phosphate groups on the DNA neutralize the positively charged amine groups on the dendrimer through electrostatic interaction and an overall positively charged system is important in cell uptake (Bielinska et al. 1999). Immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA vaccines can be improved by physical conjugation of the PAMAM dendrimer to the MHC class II-targeting peptide. Therefore, dendrimers can be further explored for DNA-based vaccine development against malaria parasite (Pietersz et al. 2006). In a recent study, dendriplexes, complexes of dendrons and condensed plasmids containing the gene for protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis, were encapsulated in polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG) particles using the double emulsion method. Studies indicated that the PLG-dendriplex particles produced superior levels of anti-PA IgG antibodies when compared to animals immunized with the PLG particles (Ribeiro et al. 2007). Conjugation of fifth-generation polyamidoamine (G5-PAMAM) dendrimers, a DNA-loading surface, with MHC class II-targeting peptides that can selectively deliver these dendrimers to APCs under conditions that enhance their immune stimulatory potency. DNA conjugated with this platform efficiently transfected murine and human APCs in vitro. Subcutaneous administration of DNA\u2013peptide\u2013dendrimer complexes in vivo preferentially transfected dendritic cells (DC) in the draining lymph nodes, promoted generation of high affinity T cells, and elicited rejection of established tumors. Taken together, our findings show how PAMAM\u2013dendrimer complexes can be used for high transfection efficiency and effective targeting of APCs in vivo, conferring properties essential to generate effective DNA vaccines. Multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) dendrimer system is being used for vaccine and immunization purposes. MAP-based delivery can prepare by addition of multiple immune-functional components, like B/T-cell epitopes, cell-penetrating peptides, and lipophilic moieties or by controlled synthesis of nanomaterials like micelles, dendrimers, and nanoparticles (Fujita and Taguchi 2011). A tetravalent multiple antigen peptide (MAP) dendrimer with four identical branches of a C-terminal peptide sequence of the rat GH-BP (GH-BP263-279) was synthesized and used as an immunogen in rabbits. The tetravalent rat GH-BP263-279 MAP dendrimer served as an effective immunogenic antigen in eliciting specific antibodies (Aguilar et al. 2009). Similar to MAP dendrimers, glycopeptide dendrimers containing both carbohydrates and peptides can be also used in delivery of vaccine components (Niederhafner et al. 2008; Sebestik et al. 2011).",

Poly (propyleneimine) dendrosome-based genetic immunization found to be highly effective against hepatitis B when compared to dendrimer\u2013plasmid\nDNA complex, and the results indicate that dendrosomes hold great potential in DNA vaccination. In dendrosomes, the poly(propyleneimine) dendrimer\u2013DNA complex is largely protected by multilamelarity of the vesicles. It has been reported that polyamidoamine dendrimer-based dendrosomes are efficient systems for the delivery of s10siRNA targeting E6/E7 oncogenes in cervical cancer (Pourasgari et al. 2009). In vitro superior transfection efficiency displayed by PAMAM dendrosomes as comparison to other nonviral gene delivery vectors. Nontoxic self-assembled dendritic spheroidal nanoparticles (Den123) have been used for the delivery of pCMV-Betv1 loaded dendritic spheroidal nanoparticles (Den123) have shown low toxicity, enhanced transfection efficiency, and improved the immune response against birch pollen allergy (Balenga et al. 2006). Similarly, efficiency of dendrosome (a gene porter) is assessed in transferring recombinant human rotavirus VP2 cDNA. Studies revealed that dendrosome has lower cytotoxicity and better transfectivity in A549, a human lung cell line (Pourasgari et al. 2009). Dendrosome has been used to deliver the DNA vaccines encoding HIV-1 p24-gp41 gene. Studies have proved the efficacy of this carrier for the delivery of recombinant plasmids construct (Roodbari et al. 2012).",

Polymersomes are made up from amphiphilic block copolymers that allow polymersomes to stably encapsulate or integrate a broad range of active molecules. The aqueous core can be utilized for the encapsulation of therapeutic hydrophilic molecules and the membrane can integrate hydrophobic drugs within its hydrophobic part. Further, the brush-like surface properties of the polymersome can provide better biocompatibility and blood circulation times. These systems have better loading efficiency, stabilities and provide sustained, controlled release of encapsulated therapeutics. Further, these systems have also been used to deliver biotherapeutics, especially peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids to site-specific cellular environment due to escape from endolysosomes (Levine et al. 2008; Christian et al. 2009). Amphiphilic diblock copolymer of poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate)-block-poly(2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate in association with tannic acid forms DNA-loaded polymersomes. Developed systems have demonstrated better cytosolic release of encapsulated nucleic acid materials (Lomas et al. 2011). Further, calcein-loaded polymersomes have also observed for their cytosolic delivery within dendritic cell (Scott et al. 2012). Similarly, poly(g-benzyl-l-glutamate)-K (PBLG50-K) polymersomes have been used for delivery of influenza hemagglutinin antigen. The immunogenicity and adjuvanticity of developed polymerosomes was better for administered the influenza antigen.

A nanoemulsion formulation of intranasal hepatitis B vaccine showed improved vaccine efficacy, stability and ease of distribution (Makidon et al. 2008). Multiple emulsion formulations can also be used as vaccine carrier systems due to its longer stability and high entrapment efficiency of protein antigens without damage during emulsification procedures. Types of surfactants, processing methods and stabilizers is requisite for making stable multiple-emulsions (Hanson et al. 2008). The emulsion adjuvant MF59 immunostimulator has been shown to result in the recruitment of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to the site of injection and to increased uptake of soluble antigen by the APCs. It has been formulated by a simple mixing of the antigen with the adjuvant and has shown excellent compatibility with a variety of subunit antigens. MF59 shows strong immunogenicity as comparison to other adjuvant is clearly seen in pre-clinical data published by Ott et al.

            "text": "The oral route is the most popular and convenient route of administration. Oral delivery refers to absorption from the buccal through the rectal mucosa. Several barriers associated with genetic vaccination through the oral are generally attributed to (a) low permeability across biological membranes, (b) harsh gastric environment, (c) hepatic first-pass metabolism, and (d) chemical instability. The major drawback with oral route of administration is a higher concentration and is required for the vaccine to be effective due to dilution during the transport of the vaccine through the gastrointestinal tract. To date, most gene delivery strategies have concentrated on the parenteral route of delivery and oral administration has been largely ignored. Different nano- and microparticulate delivery systems using natural and synthetic lipid and polymers have been utilized to improve the stability and immunogenicity of oral DNA vaccines (Bhavsar and Amiji 2007). Oral vaccination with DNA\u2013chitosan nanoparticles has appeared interesting because of their great stability and the ease of target accessibility, besides chitosan immunostimulatory properties. Studies demonstrated that 47 % of protection against parasite infection after delivery chitosan nanoparticles loaded with DNA encoding Rho1-GTPase protein of Schistosoma mansoni (Oliveira et al. 2012). Similarly, chitosan nanoparticles are used for DNA vaccine against Vibrio anguillarum through oral route. Studies revealed that chitosan\u2013DNA (pVAOMP38) complex showed moderate protection against experimental V. anguillarum infection after oral vaccination in Asian sea bass (Rajesh Kumar et al. 2008). The orally administered tresylmonomethoxypolyethylene glycol (TMPEG) grafted liposome complexes with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA(IIIB/beta-gal) is also capable of delivering the transgenes to mucosal tissues and enhances the Env-specific cellular and humoral immune responses after repeated oral immunization of BALB/c mice (Naito et al. 2007). Mannosylated niosomes loaded with hepatitis DNA have shown humoral (both systemic and mucosal) and cellular immune response upon oral administration (Jain et al. 2005). Chitosan-coated and polyplex-loaded liposomes (PLLs) containing plasmid pRc/CMV-HBs are developed for oral delivery of vaccines specifically for targeting to Peyer\u2019s patch. Chitosan-coated PLL demonstrated better uptake of encapsulated DNA to the distal intestine and provide better stability from enzymatic degradation (Channarong et al. 2011).",

            "text": "The nasal route has been chiefly employed for producing local action on the mucosa. This route has a number of advantages, such as the high permeability of the nasal epithelium, which allows a higher molecular mass cut-off for permeation of approximately 1,000 Da, as well as the rapid drug absorption rate. Accurate and repeated dispensing of vaccine, mucociliary clearance, presence of peptidases, proteases and nuclease enzymes in the mucus or associated with nasal membrane, variation in extent of absorption with the mucus secretion and mucus turnover and deposition of the formulated vaccine to all areas of the nasal mucosa (especially lymphoid tissues), potential of uptake of vaccine formulations by the primary olfactory nerves in the nasal cavity, local irritation and unpleasant taste from concentrated drug reaching the mouth are major challenges associated with intranasal delivery of vaccines (Oliveira et al. 2007; Sharma et al. 2009). These problems can be overcome by design of appropriate antigen carriers. Nanocarriers for nasal vaccines are able to facilitate the transport of the associated antigen across the nasal epithelium, thus leading to efficient antigen presentation to the immune system and provide the protection and stability of encapsulated genetic materials (Koping-Hoggard et al. 2005). Further, use of mucoadhesive agents offers a strategy for the facilitation of increased residence time and increased vaccine efficacy (Alpar et al. 2005). Polycarbophil (PC) or polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based in-situ mucoadhesive polymers have demonstrated better nasal absorption of plasmid DNA (Park et al. 2002). Several studies have proven that wide applicability of chitosan nanoparticles for the nasal delivery of DNA vaccines like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Raghuwanshi et al. 2012), pneumococcal surface antigen A (PsaA) (Xu et al. 2011), hepatitis B antigen-encoding plasmid (Khatri et al. 2008), and DNA plasmid-expressing epitopes of respiratory syncytial virus (Iqbal et al. 2003). Further, several modification on the chitosan polymers have also been made to improve the potential of chitosan nanoparticles for nasal administration of DNA vaccines like preparation of low molecular weight chitosan, development of water soluble chitosan (N-trimethyl chitosan), etc. Blends of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) have exhibited the capacity to associate and release plasmid DNA in a controlled manner. Results showed that DNA-loaded nanoparticles elicit significantly pronounced immune response compared to the naked plasmid DNA for up to 6 weeks (Csaba et al. 2006). Dry-powder influenza virosomes-based vaccines have also been advantageous for mucosal immunization (de Jonge et al. 2007). Needle-free nasal immunization, using nanoemulsion is made of soya bean oil, alcohol, water and detergents emulsified into droplets of 40 nm, has been reported to be a safe and effective hepatitis B vaccine (Makidon et al. 2008). The release of liquid or particles into the airflow enters one nostril via a sealing nozzle and exits through the other nostril and minimizes the risk and problems related to deposition of particles in the lung, which occurs during conventional inhalation from a nebulizer and increases the delivery of particles to the posterior part of the nasal mucosa. Encapsulation of the antigen into bioactive nanoparticles is a promising approach to nasal vaccine delivery (Slutter et al. 2008).",

The eye mucosa is a possible route for mucosal vaccine because it is an important entry point for environmental antigens and infectious materials occupying most of the external ocular surface (Streilein et al. 1997). Lymphoid follicles are found in close association with the epithelium of the conjunctival mucosa in humans, rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, pigs, and many other mammals (Chodosh et al. 1998). However, this certain drawbacks associate with this route are poor drainage of instilled solutions, tear turnover, poor corneal permeability, metabolism (enzymatic degradation) and low capacity for transport, nasolacrimal drainage, and systemic absorption. Eye drop vaccination of influenza A/PR/8 virus (H1N1) induced both influenza virus-specific systemic and mucosal Ab responses and protected mice completely against respiratory infection with influenza A/PR/8 virus (Seo et al. 2010). Ocular mucosal delivery of peptide epitopes of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) glycoprotein D (gD) has mixed with oligodeoxy nucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs (CpG2007). Results suggested enhanced local and systemic immune response after multi-instillation of gD peptide epitopes with CpG2007 adjuvants (Nesburn et al. 2005).

Vaginal route serves as a potential site of drug administration for local and systemic absorption of therapeutically important molecules, proteins, peptides, small interfering RNAs, oligonucleotides, antigens, vaccines and hormones (Hussain and Ahsan 2005). It is one of alternative site for the systemic delivery of protein drugs because of the relatively high permeability of the vaginal epithelium, by passage of the hepatic first-pass metabolism, large surface area and rich blood supply (Gupta et al. 2011). Quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) [types 6, 11, 16, 18] recombinant vaccine (Gardasil\u00ae; Silgard\u00ae) is composed of virus-like particles (VLPs) formed by self-assembly of recombinant L1 capsid protein from each of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. The VLPs are highly immunogenic, inducing high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the particular HPV types when administered to animals or humans (McCormack and Joura 2011). Human papillomavirus (HPV)-based gene transfer vectors (pseudovirions; PsVs) have been used to deliver SIV genes to the vaginal epithelium. Studies revealed that intravaginal vaccination with HPV-based PsVs vector delivering SIV Gag DNA for HIV have induced mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune response in serum and the vaginal tract (Gordon et al. 2012). Thermo-sensitive mucoadhesive vaginal vaccine delivery systems have also been tested for the local and systemic antibody responses to HPV 16 L1 virus-like particles (Park et al. 2003). Vaginal delivery of vaccines which is associated with vaginal infection could be better alternative to induce an immune response in the genital mucosa capable of controlling the entry of the pathogen.",

            "text": "Noninvasive gene delivery approaches could be able to deliver and express naked plasmid DNA to tissue-specific localized delivery to skin. There are several advantages of needle-free noninvasive gene administration such as limited toxicity, potential cell receptor-independent uptake, minimal DNA size restrictions, and the potential for multiple treatments via a relatively uncomplicated administration modality, thus improving patient compliance. Topically applied formulation, especially nanosystems have been shown to enter skin, accumulate in hair follicles, diffuse via dendritic cells to draining lymph nodes, and elicit antigen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Nasir 2009). A number of methods have been developed to perform noninvasive topical gene delivery, which includes passive diffusion of genetic materials between a skin patch and skin, as well as active processes such as iontophoresis, sonophoresis, electroporation, and chemically enhanced diffusion (Mehier-Humbert and Guy 2005). Topical vaccination has been achieved using topical application of naked DNA with or without tape stripping and DNA/lipid-based complex such as liposomes, niosomes, Transfersomes, or microemulsion (Cui and Sloat 2006). Ethanol-in-fluorocarbon-based microemulsion has been for topically delivery of anthrax protective antigen (PA) protein-encoding DNA vaccine (pGPA). pGPA-loaded microemulsion has significantly enhanced the anti-PA antibody responses (Cui and Sloat 2006). Similarly, DNA delivery by novel lipid-based biphasic delivery system has significant deliver plasmid DNA into the \u201cviable\u201d layers of skin (Foldvari et al. 2006). Plasmid DNA-encoding hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-loaded cationic transfersomes are also utilized for topical immunization. Results revealed that DNA-loaded cationic transfersomes elicited significantly higher anti-HBsAg antibody titer and cytokines level as compared to naked DNA. It was also observed that topical application of DNA-loaded cationic transfersomes elicited a comparable serum antibody titer and endogenous cytokines levels as produced after intramuscular recombinant HBsAg administration (Mahor et al. 2007). 40- or 200-nm sized polystyrene nanoparticles have been studied to target active compounds to the hair follicle and may result in a better penetration and higher efficiency of compound uptake by skin resident cells. Studies demonstrated that 40 and 200 nm NPs and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing the green-fluorescent protein penetrated deeply into hair follicles and uptake by APCs and transport to the draining lymph nodes (Mahe et al. 2009). Nanoengineered genetic vaccine formulation has been developed for topical immunization comprising of emulsifying wax (oil phase), CTAB (cationic surfactant), Mannan (DC ligand), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (endosomolytic agents), and cholesterol. All pDNA-coated nanoparticles, especially the mannan-coated pDNA-nanoparticles with DOPE, have shown significant immune response (IgG titers; 16-fold over \u201cnaked\u201d pDNA alone) (Cui and Mumper 2002).",

Liquid jet injector is an approach in which DNA vaccine is delivered around the Langerhans cells by a high-speed injector. (Chen et al. 2002) reported that particle-mediated gene-gun DNA immunization use similar mechanical devices to deliver DNA vaccines into viable epidermis (Chen et al. 2002). Microneedle arrays is a set of needles of microscale length with their nanoscale tips coated with DNA and can accurately, efficiently and safely deliver biomolecules to the viable cells of the epidermis. Recently, Tran et al. (2008) developed a unique nanoliposomal ultrasound-mediated device for delivering small interfering RNA (siRNA) specifically targeting melanocytic tumors present in the skin and they observed that decrease early melanocytic lesion development in the skin and prevent the spread of cutaneous metastases of melanoma (Tran et al. 2008). These results suggested that skin may provide an appealing, noninvasive route of delivery for DNA vaccines and other therapeutic genes. Table 4 represents positive and negative aspects of various routes of administration, which are very helpful for selection of particular route.\n",

Various immunity responses were generated by different adjuvant like MF59 and MPL\u00ae generated Th1 responses, VLPs, virosomes, nondegradable nanoparticles, and liposomes generated cellular immune responses in humans. Viral vectors, ISCOMs and Montanide\u2122 ISA51, 720 and various nanoparticulate immunopotentiators and antigen delivery vehicles have shown CTL responses. The desirable responses can be achieved by using combination of various adjuvants. Systemic antibodies produced in humans when viral-vectored vaccines as well as proteasomes given IN. The clinical trials required for vaccine approval are often very long and difficult. Furthermore, since many vaccines are often administered to healthy individuals, and frequently to infants, it is critical that they are proven safe and well tolerated in nonhuman primates before entering human trials. While the development of novel vaccine delivery systems and adjuvant has been aided by nanotechnology, it must be necessary to perceived potential problems such as their high surface area and reactivity, the ability to cross biological membranes, slow biodegradability of some materials, its safety and tolerability before its approval. Many challenges must be met before new classes of vaccines become available like ability to stimulate humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses, longer duration response, easily metabolized of vaccine components in body, cost-effective production, and lesser risk and less invasive approaches for the administration of vaccinations. As these challenges are met, the prevention and therapy of many previously untreatable diseases should become increasingly possible.",
