The mechanisms underlying such associations remain unclear. We aimed to study the association between ethnicity and risk of COVID-19 infection and disentangle any correlation with socioeconomic deprivation or previous comorbidity. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: UK Biobank linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and COVID-19 tests until 14 April 2020. Participants: UK Biobank participants from England, excluding drop-outs and deaths. Main measures: COVID-19 infection based on a positive PCR test. Ethnicity was selfreported and classified using Office of National Statistics groups. Socioeconomic status was based on index of multiple deprivation quintiles. Comorbidities were self-reported and completed from HES. Analyses: Multivariable Poisson analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios of COVID-19 infection according to ethnicity, adjusted for socioeconomic status, alcohol drinking, smoking, body mass index, age, sex, and comorbidity. Results: 415,582 participants were included, with 1,416 tested and 651 positive for COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was 0.61% (95% CI: 0.46%-0.82%) in Black/Black British participants, 0.32% (0.19%-0.56%) in 'other' ethnicities, 0.32% (0.23%-0.47%) in Asian/Asian British, 0.30% (0.11%-0.80%) in Chinese, 0.16% (0.06%-0.41%) in mixed, and 0.14% (0.13%-0.15%) in White. Compared with White participants, Black/Black British participants had an adjusted relative risk (RR) of 3.30 (2.39-4.55), Chinese participants 3.00 (1.11-8.06), Asian/Asian British participants 2.04 (1.36-3.07), 'other' ethnicities 1.93 (1.08-3.45), and mixed ethnicities 1.07 (0.40-2.86).",

As the virus spreads nationally and internationally, data continue to arise on subpopulations most at risk of contracting this disease and developing its severest forms. Weekly data from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) [1] suggest that COVID-19 was responsible for 6,213 deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 10 April 2020, equivalent to 33.6% of all deaths observed. Although almost 40% of the casualties were patients aged 75 to 84 years old, there is increasing evidence of life-threatening forms of COVID-19 in younger age groups. Almost 5% of COVID-19-related ICU admissions in Italy have been under 40 years old, and another 36% have been 40 to 60 years old. Overall, 82% of these patients have been men. [2] Concerns have been raised recently that Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities in the UK might be at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, including BAME healthcare professionals. [3] There is, however, a scarcity of data on whether this excess mortality is related to higher susceptibility to infection, higher risk of lethal forms of the disease, or poorer prognosis. Emerging data from seroprevalence studies [4] and US hospital electronic medical records [5] do not support these hypotheses, suggesting geographic heterogeneity.",
