            "text": "Infectious disease epidemiology relies on integrating increasingly diverse and complex data. This complexity comes not only from the types of data now collected (for example genetic sequence, image and digital sensor data are routinely generated during the course of a disease outbreak, together with more traditional epidemiological data) but also through multiple partners investigating different facets, from different specialities or covering different geographical areas. This has been seen in recent major epidemics including the 2009 influenza pandemic (Fraser et al., 2009), Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome outbreaks (Cauchemez et al., 2014) or the West-African Ebola epidemic (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014, WHO Ebola Response Team, 2015). In this context, the safe storage and swift exchange of epidemiological data between collaborators and institutions is key to the successful assessment of, and response to, infectious disease epidemics. Consequently, a great deal of effort has been recently devoted to standardising platforms for the analysis of epidemiological data with software tools being constructed to permit interoperability between separate methodological approaches (Jombart et al., 2014). Similar efforts have also been made in the fields of epidemiological data-gathering and recording (Aanensen et al., 2009, ECDC, 2015).",

            "text": "Overall however, there is a scarcity of systematised approaches for the transfer of data. The production of such a capability would vastly improve our ability to transfer information between systems and in doing so aid the interpretation of disease dynamics and ultimately protect a greater number of individuals. Yet epidemics data are still, usually, held as a potentially confusing mass of spread-sheets, databases, text and binary files. A universal format enabling the coherent storage and transfer of these data is lacking. As a consequence, misinterpretation of the data may happen during transfer and result in errors being introduced into subsequent analyses and reports. Unfortunately, the inherent complexity of epidemiological data magnifies the risks of such errors. Fig. 1\nillustrates the major systems within an epidemiology work-flow where a standard for digital epidemiology data would be of assistance. A major difficulty associated with transferring epidemiological data lies in the degree of complexity that a dataset may display. The information that is recorded may vary markedly not only between outbreaks but also within a single outbreak. In addition, the epidemic context itself makes data collection a daunting task, leading to some inevitable disparities in the data recorded.",

At the top level of this common structure is information relating to the dataset as a whole, such as the name of the infection that is causing the epidemic or the particular geographic setting of the study. This information is meta-data. At a second level, most datasets are divided into subunits (units-of-record) that hold other information. These subunits could be individuals, regions, countries or time periods. In a conventional spreadsheet these units-of-record are usually stored as rows. The information relating to these units-of-record makes up the third level and is usually stored as columns in a conventional spreadsheet. This information can either relate directly to the unit-of-record itself (such as gender for an individual) or can relate to an event happening to or at that unit-of-record (such as the onset of symptoms for an individual).",

            "text": "The EpiJSON format capitalises on the common structure of most epidemiological datasets outlined above. Fundamentally, the structure of an EpiJSON file consists of three levels that we term \u201cmetadata\u201d, \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cevents\u201d (Fig. 2\n). Within each of these three levels, data are stored in collections of objects called \u201cattributes\u201d which are the core of data storage in EpiJSON. An \u201cattribute\u201d object is used for storing unambiguously a discrete piece of information, recording not only the value of the data but also its name, type and units. The \u201cname\u201d is a label defining what the attribute is (e.g. \u201cage\u201d or \u201cgender\u201d), \u201ctype\u201d defines the type of data being stored (e.g. \u201cnumber\u201d or \u201cstring\u201d), \u201cvalue\u201d is the actual data value (e.g. 42 or \u201cmale\u201d), and the optional \u201cunits\u201d key specifies measurement units (e.g. \u201cyears\u201d). As this data representation is very generic, it is used as a unit of data storage across the whole structure of EpiJSON. For example: an \u201cattribute\u201d\u201d object could be used to store the name of an infection within \u201cmetadata\u201d, the gender of an individual within a \u201crecord\u201d, and the infection status of an individual at a test within an \u201cevent\u201d. The difference between an \u201cevent\u201d and an \u201cattribute\u201d is that an \u201cevent\u201d occurs at a defined time or place and can therefore store dates and locations using standard formats.",

This is a character string but is limited to certain enumerated values contained in Table 3\n. Identifying the data type is necessary to ensure that software will correctly interpret the data when parsing an EpiJSON file. The \u201cvalue\u201d key holds the actual value of the attribute object. This may be either a character string, a number, an integer, a Boolean value, a JSON object or a homogeneous array of one of these (other types as specified in the type key are effectively sub-types of these primitives).

Certain characteristics of a unit-of-record are fixed (e.g. gender or region name) and may be recorded as part of the \u201cattributes\u201d of a given record. Alternatively, other characteristics occur in space or time and are stored as \u201cevents\u201d. The record object consists of three keys: \u201cid\u201d, \u201cattributes\u201d and \u201cevents\u201d (Table 4\n). The \u201cid\u201d key should be a string conforming to and generated according to version 4 UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier) specification as found in RFC 4122 (Leach et al., 2005), and represents the unique identifier of a record. Correctly generated, such a UUID is considered to be sufficiently individual that this identifier will be unique across all EpiJSON datasets and greatly simplifies aggregation and sub-setting operations. Should it be necessary to keep another identifier from an existing system then this should be stored as an attribute of the record. The \u201cattributes\u201d key holds an array of \u201cattribute\u201d objects (as above). These are the attributes of this specific record object. The \u201cevents\u201d key holds an array of \u201cevent\u201d objects (noted \u201cevent[]\u201d) relating to this record. Events are usually distinguished from attributes by occurring in time or space while attributes tend to have no spatio-temporal component.

In the short term the availability of an R package permits not only EpiJSON files to be used within R but also for them to be converted to and from a wide range of file formats including the ubiquitous csv spreadsheet format read by most systems. The next step is for library functions for common languages to be written, easing the developer effort for high level packages familiar to the epidemiological user base.

We believe that the user is better served by well tested external encryption libraries or tools than by providing a mechanism within the EpiJSON standard that would become rapidly obsolescent. However we envisage that much as HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language, the text format of most Web pages) may be encrypted using HTTPS, the text based EpiJSON could be encrypted using a system such as ssl to provide an encrypted version of the format. Such a development would also provide the user with the choice of symmetric, password-based encryption as used in later versions of well-known spreadsheet programs or the more secure key-based asymmetric encryption commonly in use on the internet in banking and encrypted email transactions.",

As with encryption, it is not within the scope of a format for epidemiological data to specify a data compression standard but note that, as a structured text document with a good deal of repetition, EpiJSON files compress well using commonly available compression tools.

The adoption of well-defined data standards makes both the contribution of data to communal efforts and the development of data tools much easier. This has been the case for public transport data (Google, 2015), where a standard allows companies to submit their timetables in a form that can be used by Google Maps to provide route information. This definition of an open data structure for epidemiology is the first step in allowing other developers and collaborators to modify their software and work-flows to utilise the standard.
