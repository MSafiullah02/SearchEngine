            "text": "IFN-\u03b1 is thought to induce ISG expression primarily through the formation of ISGF3, a transcription factor complex composed of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 (ref. 1). To determine whether the inhibition of HCV replication by IFN-\u03b1 requires STAT1, two clones of STAT1 knockout Huh-7.5 human hepatoma cells were established using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. A frame shift mutation or a nonsense mutation was introduced into each allele of STAT1 (Fig. 1A). A clone of Huh-7.5 cells expressing a non-targeting (NT) sgRNA was also established to use as control cells. Wild-type (WT) Huh-7.5 cells, NT sgRNA-expressing cells, and STAT1 knockout cells were infected with cell culture-grown HCV (HCVcc) of the J6/JFH1 chimeric genome and treated with IFN-\u03b1. As expected, IFN-\u03b1 treatment decreased the HCV nonstructural protein 5 A (NS5A) in WT cells and NT sgRNA-expressing cells (Fig. 1B). This decrease was partially attenuated but not abolished in STAT1 knockout cells. IFN-\u03b1 treatment increased PKR expression in WT cells and NT sgRNA-expressing cells, and this increase was also not abolished in STAT1 knockout cells. Consistent with the decrease in NS5A expression, IFN-\u03b1 treatment decreased HCV RNA in both control cells and STAT1 knockout cells (Fig. 1C). Similar results regarding NS5A were obtained with Huh-7.5 cells harboring HCV subgenomic replicon (Fig. 1D). In contrast, IFN-\u03b3 treatment decreased NS5A in NT sgRNA-expressing cells but not in STAT1 knockout cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). This is consistent with the central role of STAT1 in IFN-\u03b3 signaling1. These results suggest that STAT1 is involved in but not essential for the inhibition of HCV replication by IFN-\u03b1.",

To extend the finding that STAT1 is essential for the induction of specific ISGs by IFN-\u03bb but not by IFN-\u03b1, microarray analysis was performed using control Huh-7.5 cells and STAT1 knockout cells. The genes that were up-regulated by both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb in control cells were analyzed. Many of these genes, including well-known ISGs such as IFI6 and IFIT1, were also up-regulated by 24 h treatment with IFN-\u03b1 in STAT1 knockout cells (Fig. 6C and Table 1). Some ISGs such as SAMD9 and HERC5 showed higher expression in response to IFN-\u03b1 in STAT1 knockout cells than in control cells, whereas others such as LGALS3BP and BST2 showed the opposite expression pattern. In contrast to IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03bb increased expression of only a limited number of genes (such as FCN2) in STAT1 knockout cells (see Supplementary Dataset 1).

            "text": "IFN-\u03bb is the most recently discovered member of the IFN family. The difference between IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb has been intensively studied. Consistent with previous studies56, our results using Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells suggest that both STAT1 and STAT2 are involved in the early induction of ISGs in response to IFN-\u03b1, most likely through the formation of ISGF3, but that when IFN-\u03b1 stimulation is prolonged, ISGs can be induced by a STAT2-dependent, STAT1-independent pathway (Fig. 8). Accordingly, IFN-\u03b1 can inhibit HCV replication to some extent in the absence of STAT1 (Fig. 1). This inhibition requires STAT2 (Fig. 2) and IRF9 (Fig 4) but does not appear to require STAT3 or STAT6 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, IFN-\u03b1 can induce STAT2 phosphorylation in STAT1 knockout cells (Fig. 7). Previous studies have shown that expression of a fusion protein of STAT2 and IRF9 inhibits the replication of viruses including HCV in the absence of STAT1 (refs 28, 29). It is therefore likely that IFN-\u03b1 can inhibit HCV replication through the STAT2/IRF9 complex9. Our results also suggest that unlike IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03bb induces expression of the majority of ISGs and inhibits HCV replication exclusively through a STAT1-dependent pathway. This difference between IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb signaling may possibly explain the fact that the genes induced by IFN-\u03bb are typically a subset of the genes induced by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2131530. Our microarray analysis indicated that IFN-\u03b1 induced expression of ISGs such as OAS2 and IFIT1 in STAT1 knockout Huh-7.5 cells (Table 1). In contrast, the induction of these ISGs is abrogated in STAT1 knockout fibrosarcoma cells9. Interestingly, overexpression of STAT2 in these cells restores the induction of OAS2 and IFIT1 and also enables induction of genes that do not contain ISREs. Endogenous STAT2 may also mediate ISRE-independent gene induction in response to IFN-\u03b1, at least in certain cell types.",

For example, HCV decreases RIG-I-like receptor-dependent IFN production by cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) in infected cells3233. HCV has also been proposed to suppress ISGF3-mediated gene induction31. When overexpressed, the HCV core protein binds to STAT1 and prevents its phosphorylation34. However, a study using a luciferase reporter assay showed that HCVcc infection does not block ISRE-dependent gene induction in response to IFN-\u03b235. This may suggest that like IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 can induce ISG expression independently of STAT1. Indeed, treatment with INF-\u03b2 decreased NS5A in STAT1 knockout cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). We showed that knockout of STAT1 abolished the induction of ISGs such as PKR and IRF9 by IFN-\u03bb in HCVcc-infected cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the inhibition of STAT1-dependent IFN-\u03bb signaling by HCVcc is incomplete. It would be interesting to determine whether IFN-\u03b1 has more potent antiviral activity than IFN-\u03bb against other viruses that are thought to inhibit STAT1.",

Until recently, recombinant IFN-\u03b1, alone or in combination with ribavirin, was the only therapeutic option for patients infected with HCV. IFN-\u03b1 is also produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells that have received viral RNA from HCV-infected hepatocytes via exosomes37. HCV-infected hepatocytes, on the other hand, preferentially produce IFN-\u03bb38. Humans have four IFN-\u03bb genes (IFNL1, IFNL2, IFNL3, and IFNL4)39. IFN-\u03bb1 was used throughout this study. We have confirmed that IFN-\u03bb2 treatment is also unable to decrease NS5A in STAT1 knockout cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). The newly discovered IFN-\u03bb4 is expressed only in people who carry the IFNL4-\u0394G allele and not in the others because of a frame shift mutation. When infected with HCV, people carrying the IFNL4-\u0394G allele show higher ISG expression and lower HCV RNA levels in the liver. This is consistent with the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03bb4 observed in cell culture40. However, people carrying the IFNL4-\u0394G allele are less likely to clear HCV infection spontaneously or in response to IFN-\u03b1-based therapy. The reason for this paradox is unknown, but IFN-\u03bb4 has been speculated to render HCV-infected hepatocytes refractory to IFN-\u03b1, for example by inducing the expression of USP18, which inhibits IFN-\u03b1 but not IFN-\u03bb signaling41. It is tempting to speculate that hepatocyte-produced IFN-\u03bb4 is incapable of clearing HCV infection in vivo, at least in part because of its inability to induce STAT1-independent gene expression.",
