ESC are derived from the blastocysts during embryo development. ESC are pluripotent because they have the potential to self-renew and also to differentiate into any cell type. In the laboratory, ESC lines can remain undifferentiated under specific conditions. Undifferentiated ESC can directly undergo differentiation into specific functional cell types. It is envisioned that differentiated ESC can be used to cure diseases. Examples of clinical applications of ESC include diabetes, heart diseases, traumatic spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy, and hearing and vision loss. iPSC are adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to dedifferentiate into behaving like ESC. Mouse iPSC were first reported in 2006 [1], and soon after, the first human iPSC were successfully generated in 2007 [2].\n",

The first one being hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and the other being bone marrow stromal cells, which are also known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Since then, ASC have been identified in many organs and tissues, including brain, bone marrow, peripheral blood, blood vessels, skeletal muscle, skin, teeth, heart, gut, liver, ovarian epithelium, and testis. HSC can differentiate into all blood cell lineages such as red blood cells, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages [3]. MSC are multipotent and can give rise to a variety of cell types such as bone cells (osteoblasts and osteocytes), cartilage cells (chondrocytes), fat cells (adipocytes), and stromal cells.",

The unique property that allows stem cells to differentiate into specific cell types offers the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues in cell-based therapy. Indeed, over 40 years ago, HSC transfer was initially conducted in the form of bone marrow transplantation with successful allogeneic transplantations performed for an infant with X-linked lymphopenic immune deficiency [4]. Stem cell therapy generated great enthusiasm in the 1980s as a targeted and permanent treatment for many previously incurable autoimmune disorders. In 1986, Jacobs et al. reported that allogeneic HSC transplant in a patient with drug-induced aplastic anemia and severe rheumatoid arthritis not only reversed the hematological abnormality but also simultaneously resulted in a 2-year period of relief from joint pain [5]. HSC therapy also resulted in significant clinical improvements in other autoimmune diseases [6\u201310]. In 1996, the First International Symposium on HSC Therapy in autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) was convened in Basel, which led to the development of the first consensus guidelines for HSCT in autoimmunity recommending standardized protocols and established the European Bone Marrow Transplant/European League Against Rheumatism (EBMT/EULAR) registry [11]. Since then, over 1,500 HSC transplants for ARD, including systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (SS), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), have been registered [12]. Despite its promise of potential long-term benefit, acute toxicity such as infection and bleeding during the aplastic period, complications due to opportunistic infections during the T-cell reconstitution phase, and the possibility of developing a second autoimmune disease should be carefully considered [13, 14].",

            "text": "Multipotent MSC have recently gained significant attention in the treatment of ARD. MSC was initially isolated from guinea pig bone marrow as spindle-shaped cells with progenitor properties that adhered to plastic and formed fibroblast colonies [15]. MSC are not truly pluripotent, and most MSC described to date are actually multipotent progenitors obtained from a wide range of tissues such as bone marrow, umbilical cord, placenta, cord blood, adipose tissue, synovium, and teeth. Human MSC are now phenotypically characterized as CD105+, CD73+ and CD90+, CD45\u2212, CD34\u2212, CD14\u2212 or CD11b\u2212, CD79a\u2212 or CD19\u2212, and negative for HLA class II molecules. Human MSC must also be plastic-adherent cells and have the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts [16]. However, these criteria are not unique because CD105, CD73, or CD90 is also expressed on other cell populations, while other cell markers are also expressed in MSC [17]. Moreover, there are various sources of MSC with differentiation potentials that are different from the criteria described above [18]. Essentially, MSC represent a heterogeneous progenitor cell population with immunomodulatory properties, which are able to suppress T- and B-cell proliferation, inhibit the differentiation of monocytes into immature dendritic cells, and affect the functions of NK cells [19, 20]. MSC express low levels of cell surface HLA class I molecules and are negative for HLA class II molecules. Meanwhile, MSC do not express co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, or CD40. Hence, MSC can easily escape immune surveillance [21]. Biologically, the regenerative, immune privileged, immunomodulatory, and tissue-protective properties of MSC suggest that these cells are effective therapeutic reagents in human diseases [20\u201324].",

The hallmark of the clinical application of MSC therapy was phase I study in which 23 patients experienced full remission after treatment of various hematological malignancies in 1995. Moreover, there were no adverse events after intravenous infusion of ex vivo expended bone marrow-derived MSC [39]. The first published report describing the application of MSC in therapeutic intervention was on breast cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy. This study showed that MSC therapy was safe and had the potential to enhance HSC engraftment [40]. Thereafter, animal studies, in vitro, and clinical studies on MSC have increased rapidly.",

Based on epidemiological data, approximately 3.4 million individuals are affected globally. Despite advances in early diagnosis and appropriate therapy, the prognosis of SSc patients remains poor, and the disease is associated with a high mortality [41]. The amenable treatment for SSc is immunosuppressive therapy. For example, the standard of regimens for interstitial lung disease (ILD) in SSc is CYC. Nevertheless, two randomized trials and meta-analyses showed no improvement in prognosis of SSc with CYC treatment [42].",

Complete or partial remission was observed in small case series and non-randomized clinical trials of HSCT treatment for SSc patients, although there were high rates of transplant-related mortality (TRM) [44]. Data from a single-center retrospective study of SSc patients who received auto-HSCT showed significant skin and lung disease amelioration in 78.3 % of patients at 6 months, and 91 % of patients achieved an overall good response. However, cardiac events result in 6 % TRM [45]. Another subsequent analysis of 57 SSc patients receiving HSCT from the EBMT/EULAR registry showed that sustained improvement in skin score and visceral organ functions was observed in two-thirds of the patients for up to 3 years after HSCT but with a TRM of 8.7 % [46]. TRM was reduced by pretransplant evaluation, early intervention, and the use of amenable conditioning regimen.",

After 2 years of follow-up, patients receiving HSC therapy had durable remission in pulmonary function, reduction in interstitial lung lesions visualized on high-resolution CT imaging, and improved quality of life (QOL). More importantly, no TRM was reported [47]. Based on the success of phase II clinical trials [47], a phase III study is in progress to compare the safety and efficacy of the ASSIST trial pretransplant protocols of CYC and G rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rbATG) with the addition of rituximab [50]. In the multicenter phase III ASTIS trial [51], there is an increase in overall and survival benefit in patients administered with CYC 200 mg/kg and rbATG with CD34+ auto-HSCT compared to those with monthly pulse CYC treatment of HSCT that had a 10 % TRM.

Patients with SLE are presented with diverse clinical symptoms: skin lesions, arthritis, renal disorder, neurologic disorder, and hematologic changes. Major biomarkers include antinuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA antibody and anti-Sm antibody. Immune-mediated injury in multiple organs leads to high mortality and morbidity [96\u2013104]. Besides the immune imbalance, evidence from familial studies together with high concordance among monozygotic twins suggests the contribution of genetics in SLE [105\u2013108]. To date, there are many single genes, such as coagulation factor II gene (F2), TAP2 (transporter associated with antigen processing 2) gene, VKORC1gene, and autosomal gene, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE [109\u2013112]. Various environmental agents and toxicants, such as cigarette smoke, alcohol, plastic and electronic products, cosmetic agents, occupationally and non-occupationally related chemicals, ultraviolet light, infections, sex hormones, and certain medications and vaccines, are found to be associated with SLE onset or flares [113\u2013115].",

The most widely and classically used immunosuppressors include cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), leflunomide (LEF), methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine A (CsA), azathioprine (AZA), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Each of these agents, however, can carry high toxicities and many side effects. They include osteoporosis and dyslipidemia induced by corticosteroids, myelotoxicity and gonadal injury induced by CYC, gastrointestinal discomfort and liver dysfunction by MTX or LEF, and hypertension and nephrotoxicity by CsA. The main concern for the side effects of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapies is infection [120]. CYC, particularly in combination with high-dose steroids, is reported to have the strongest effect in suppressing immune responses against microorganisms. The most common infections in patients with SLE treated with these traditional drugs include virus herpes zoster, mycobacterium tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and fungal infections [120\u2013124]. These infections may worsen the disease and aggravate the economic burden of patients. Furthermore, steroids and immunosuppressive drugs are not universally effective, with partial or no response in many cases.",

Several B-cell-targeted drugs have been developed. Rituximab (RTX), a monoclonal antibody targeting the B-cell-specific receptor CD20 (anti-CD20), has been reported to be an effective treatment for patients with active SLE who failed to respond to standard therapy. A pooled analysis of the efficacy of RTX from European cohorts diagnosed with biopsy-proven lupus nephropathy showed that administration of RTX resulted in high response rates and significant improvement in 24-h proteinuria, serum albumin, and protein/creatinine ratio [125]. Despite these promising data, two other large randomized controlled studies designed to assess the efficacy of RTX in nonrenal lupus [126] and lupus nephritis [127] did not achieve their respective primary endpoints. In the ACR and EULAR guidelines for the management of patients with refractory lupus nephritis (class III/IV) who have not responded to CYC nor MMF, RTX is still recommended [128]. Belimumab, another B-cell-targeted therapy, is a human immunoglobulin (Ig)-G1\u03bb monoclonal antibody that binds soluble B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and inhibits its biologic activities. The efficacy of belimumab is demonstrated in two large randomized control trials with more than 800 patients in each study [129, 130]. Pooled data showed a beneficial effect in 50.6 % of belimumab-treated patients versus 46.2 % in the placebo arm. However, the benefits obtained with belimumab are modest and only attained in patients with mild disease who are already receiving standard therapy [130]. Epratuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD22, a B-cell-specific surface antigen involved in B-cell signaling. In a phase IIb trial to assess the efficacy and safety of epratuzumab, the overall treatment effect was not statistically significant [131]. Multicenter phase III studies with epratuzumab in patients with SLE are currently ongoing.",

They penetrate the cell membrane, effectively targeting endosomal TLRs and downstream signaling proteins [139]. Almost all these drugs are in preclinical animal studies or in phase I clinical studies and still require further exploration [140\u2013142]. There are other recombinant small molecule inhibitors like abatacept, which blocks T-cell co-stimulatory ligands (CD80 and CD86) on B cells.

The therapeutic effect of allogeneic MSCT was primarily dependent on its systemic immunoregulatory effects on various immune regulatory cells. Allogeneic MSC dose-dependently inhibited T-cell proliferation [150] and inhibited Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway mediated G1/S transition of lupus T cells [151]. The frequency of CD4+ T cells decreased, and inflammatory cytokines were regulated by allogeneic MSCT in both animal models and humans [150, 152, 153]. MSC can regulate T-cell function via two pathways. First, MSC directly inhibit the functions of antigen-specific T cells. Second, MSC inhibit T-cell functions indirectly by stimulating the expansion of Treg [153\u2013156]. In addition to T cells, MSC also suppress B-cell proliferation and plasma cell differentiation [157]. Serum and local levels of B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) and IL-10 significantly declined after MSC transfusion [158], potentially explaining the reduction in specific autoantibody production. Modulation of lymphocyte function may also be mediated by other regulatory factors secreted by MSC, including TGF-\u03b2, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), prostaglandin E2 (PEG2), nitric oxide (NO), IL-10, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and HLA-G [159].

Data from phase I clinical studies showed that disease activity was satisfactorily controlled, and proteinuria and serum autoimmune antibodies declined after allogeneic MSCT [154, 166]. The transfusion of umbilical cord-derived MSC also resulted in clinical benefits in patients with severe lupus, who were otherwise poorly responsive to conventional therapy [153]. A further phase II study, with up to 4 years of follow-up, demonstrated a good clinical safety profile, with an overall rate of survival of 94 %, and about 50 % patients achieving and remaining clinical remission at 4 years visit, although relapses of disease occurred in 23 % [167]. Based on these studies, there appears to be no difference in clinical efficacy between allogeneic bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived MSCT. MSC infusion induced remission in multi-organ dysfunctions including lupus nephritis [168], diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [169], and refractory cytopenia [170]. Recently a multicenter clinical study showed that 32.5 % patients achieved major clinical response and another 27.5 % patients achieved partial clinical response during 12 months follow-up. Again, a proportion of patients (17.5 %) experienced disease relapse within 6 months of a prior clinical response and required repeated MSCT [171]. However, combining MSCT and HSCT may achieve higher efficacy for SLE patients. Autologous MSCT was also applied in two lupus patients but received no clinical efficacy [172]. Recently, combined transplantation of autologous HSCT and allogeneic MSCT was used in a Chinese female lupus patient and achieved disease remission for 36 months [173], suggesting a novel and effective therapy option for refractory SLE.",

The US single-arm data showed a 4 % (2/50) TRM [163]. The 7-year retrospective data from EBMT showed that the relapse incidence (RI) was 56 \u00b1 11 %, and non-relapse mortality was 15 \u00b1 7 % [164]. The mechanism for disease flare after auto-HSCT is not clearly understood. Niu et al. showed that the function of HSC is altered by both genetic and inflammatory factors in lupus mice [177]. Moreover, bone marrow CD34+ cells expressed a higher percentage of surface markers for CD95, CD123, and CD166 compared to healthy controls [178], thereby implying that abnormal autologous HSC in lupus patients may lead to higher rates of relapse after HSCT. Although allo-HSCT can completely restore the immune system, its clinical application has unfortunately demonstrated a high rate of treatment-related mortality and a high risk for GVHD, which limits its widespread use.",
