            "text": "Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus infectious disease-19 , has caused a pandemic with >850,000 cases worldwide and increasing. Several studies report outcomes of COVID-19 in predominately well persons. There are also some data on COVID-19 in persons with predominately solid cancer but controversy whether these persons have the same outcomes. We conducted a cohort study at two centres in Wuhan, China, of 128 hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers, 13 (10%) of whom developed COVID-19. We also studied 226 health care providers, 16 of whom developed COVID-19 and 11 of whom were hospitalised. Co-variates were compared with the 115 subjects with haematological cancers without COVID-19 and with 11 hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. There were no significant differences in baseline co-variates between subjects with haematological cancers developing or not developing COVID-19. Case rates for COVID-19 in hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers was 10% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 6, 17%) compared with 7% (4, 12%; P = 0.322) in health care providers. However, the 13 subjects with haematological cancers had more severe COVID-19 and more deaths compared with hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. Case fatality rates were 62% (32, 85%) and 0 (0, 32%; P = 0.002). Hospitalised persons with haematological cancers have a similar case rate of COVID-19 compared with normal health care providers but have more severe disease and a higher case fatality rate. Because we were unable to identify specific risk factors for COVID-19 in hospitalised persons with haematological cancers, we suggest increased surveillance and possible protective isolation.",

Median age of subjects with and without COVID-19 was 35 year (range, 23-53 years) and 49 year (range, 33-59 years; P = 0.082). Cardioand cerebrovascular diseases were the most common comorbidities with similar prevalence (24%).

No pre-COVID-19 co-variate could accurately predict which persons with haematological cancers were at greatest risk to develop COVID-19. We also found hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers and with COVID-19 had more severe disease and a higher case fatality rate compared with hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. Most of our data suggest this is attributable to their haematological cancer and/or therapy thereof. One might expect persons with immune system cancers such as lymphomas and lymphoid leukaemias might be at increased risk to develop COVID-19 compared with myeloid cancer such as AML and MDS but we found no such association. The increased case fatality rate of hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers and COVID-19 seems related predominately to bacterial coinfections.

Our diagnosis of COVID-19 was based initially on results of a screening lung CT scan but most cases were confirmed by qRT-PCR. We did not analyse infection rates with SARS-CoV-2 because tests were unavailable so are conclusions are based solely on lung CT scan findings and symptom reporting which is unreliable in subjects with haematological cancers who may have other reasons for developing fever, cough etc., especially those receiving anti-cancer therapy. Also, our start time for COVID-19 was abnormal lung CT scan or onset of symptoms a Ground-glass opacity in both lungs; b absorption of bi-lateral ground-glass opacity after treatment (patient 2); c Multiple condensation shadows in both lungs, edges were blurred; d no significant changes on image findings after treatment (patient 8); e multiple ground-glass opacity in both lungs and patchy consolidation in the right lung; and f diffuse condensation shadows with blurred edges; bronchiolar-inflation sign is seen in the left lung tissue area of the lesion after treatment (patient 4).",
