In late 2004, Chinese President Hu Jintao said he wanted to meet people with AIDS and asked his staff to arrange a visit to a Beijing hospital. This was a surprise; normally health staff have to lobby for months or years to catch the attention of top leaders, let alone to persuade them to talk to patients. But the President, quite of his own accord, was determined to meet people with HIV. The visit was arranged for the eve of World AIDS Day, which falls on 1 December. Shaking hands with patients on the AIDS wards, Hu promised to help them in every possible way. He made the pledge not just on his own behalf, he said, but on behalf of all of Chinese society.",

This allowed activist health officials to argue for the publication of data-based estimates of the total number of people living with HIV. This made more sense than ever after the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) published country-specific estimates for the first time in 2000. Using a curve-fitting model, UNAIDS staff in Geneva estimated that half a million Chinese people were living with HIV at the end of 1999. With that number already on public record, China\u2019s scientists argued, why not try and do a better job at home? They used a simple spreadsheet-based model that included estimates of the number of drug injectors, sex workers, clients, gay men, and former plasma donors, and then combined that information with estimates of the percentage of each of those groups infected with HIV. Using data for the end of 2000, the epidemiologists came up with the figure of 600,000 people living with HIV in China [6].",

Using the experience of the first round of estimates coupled with better data sources, the Ministry of Heath updated the figures the following year.

The organisations that joined to become the National Centre for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention had sought international guidance in building up a national HIV surveillance system and provided a lot of training and support to provincial governments. Several of the worst affected provinces, led by Yunnan, built up a strong HIV surveillance system in high-risk groups early in the epidemic. Yunnan was also one of the first areas to start systematic surveillance of risk behaviour. Plenty of health officials and others took significant professional risks in arguing to make the most accurate data more widely available, but their efforts did not increase public confidence in official statistics.",

The biggest splash was made by the United Nations Theme Group on HIV/AIDS in China. In June of 2002, just as the international HIV fraternity converged on Barcelona for the biennial AIDS conference and the media were looking for interesting angles on HIV, the Beijing-based Theme Group published a report entitled \u201cHIV/AIDS: China\u2019s Titanic Peril\u201d [7].

Other experts have put the number of cases in China higher by varying amounts. A UNAIDS report in China in 2002 estimated as many as 1.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS\u201d, the report said [10]. It is ironic, then, that the numbers in what came to be known as \u201cthe Titanic report\u201d in fact overlap with Chinese government estimates. The official estimate of 850,000 infections for the end of 2001 was well within the range of 800,000\u20131.5 million infections published in the Titanic report. Though the New York Times carefully pointed out the overlap, most press reports simply seized on the number at the high end of the range. Many also enthusiastically drew attention to a prediction that if more were not done to prevent the spread of HIV in China, ten million people could be infected by 2010. The report incorrectly sourced this figure to the Chinese State Council\u2019s own long-term plan of 1998; that document in fact mentioned only that unless actions were taken, 1.2 million citizens may be infected by the year 2000. The actual source of the much-quoted projection of up to ten million infections by 2010 remains unclear to this day.",

The team in Geneva had been working for some time to develop methods that would allow them to report ranges which would more reliably reflect the uncertainty of estimates that were inevitably based on limited data points. \u201cIn a country the size of China, and for a disease like HIV which is mostly invisible and so hard to measure, the difference between 800,000 and 1.5 million is nothing\u201d, Schwartl\u00e4nder said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is not the exact number, it\u2019s what you are doing about it\u201d.

At a meeting called by Wu to discuss SARS in 2003, one of the country\u2019s senior virologists, Yi Zeng, had underlined that SARS was relatively easy to control compared to the socially, culturally and politically more complex challenge presented by HIV. Scientists who were at the meeting remember the Vice Premier being struck by the information. Once SARS had been adequately dealt with, she promised, China would take on that more complex challenge. In February 2004, she transformed the earlier coordinating mechanism into the much more vigorous State Council AIDS working group, made up of the top figures from 29 ministries and seven provinces.",

HIV testing would be made universally available for free to all Chinese citizens via the local CDC or other approved facilities, and all HIV-positive pregnant women would get free antiretroviral drugs and free infant formula milk they needed to reduce transmission of the virus to their babies. On top of that, the state would provide economic support for orphans and families affected by the virus and free schooling for the children of poor people who were coping with HIV infection.",

He convinced relevant ministries and the State Council to put funds aside to pay for the initiative, which was later christened the \u201cFour Frees and One Care\u201d programme. While Gao Qiang lobbied colleagues in other departments to raise domestic spending on health, Gao Qiang also encouraged the judicious use of funds available from other sources. In its earliest incarnation, the Four Frees and One Care programme was underwritten by a grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The first grant, of US&90 million, was used largely to provide HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment to people in the seven central provinces of China most affected by the outbreak related to blood selling. Funding for HIV prevention and care from domestic coffers rose quickly (the details can be seen in Fig. 10.1007/978-981-10-3746-7_10.8 of the Chap. 10.1007/978-981-10-3746-7_10). Until 2000 it languished under US&2 million a year. In 2001, with the first 5-year plan, that amount rose sevenfold. In 2003 it more than tripled again to almost US&50 million. By 2004, the year when China\u2019s leadership really put its weight behind HIV prevention and care, government spending had hit over US&100 million [12].",
